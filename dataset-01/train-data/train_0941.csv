2,There's better out there,"Others have commented on their failings with this book. I'll add mine: layout and fonts. In theory, you'd expect a two-column layout with text on one side, and code on the other, to better visually present information than traditional textbooks. The reality, however, is snippet-heavy examples, because of insufficient space in the book to see the code. The abundance of different font sizes and colors used in code and the text less result in clarity than the Los Angeles freeway. When later using the book for reference, I had a more difficult time than I should have skimming the busy pages for information. I've since found another XML to review information from, which obviously means I don't recommend this book."
3,not like her others,"I've read some of Elizabeth Castro's other books and been fairly satisfied. Her strength has generally been showing basic material and then showing how it would look. I realize that XML isn't quite HTML, but where there should have been examples there were often things like, I.E. and Mozilla don't support this yet, so I can't show you how it should look. Perhaps the book shouldn't have been written yet, and maybe a later edition would be better."
1,Could have been better,Why is it that no one has ever written a study book which does not include verbosity? That does clearly indicate where in the examples they are referring to? That has download examples that can be easily referenced? This book sets out to solve all that but fails - dissapointed.
2,Not as Good as Castro's HTML Book,"I had high hopes for this book, But I have come away disappointed. I used Castro's HTML book to learn that language, and I was favorably impressed. I found the examples in that book easy to walk through, and I felt they did a good job explaining basic concepts and procedures. I also liked the fact that Castro brought a designer's perspective to the subject.Unfortunately, I can't say the same for this book. I have spent the better part of a day on its chapter on XSLT, and I don't feel like I have gotten a handle on the subject. I feel about the same way about XML schemas. I think XML may simply be a subject that requires a programmer's, rather than a designer's perspective.The book could use a complete rewrite, particularly its walkthroughs, which I have had trouble following and making sense of. If you need to write style sheets, schemas, or anything else beyond the simplest XML, you are probably better served by another book."
3,Good For Beginners,"This book is geared more towards the ""For Dummies"" crowd. It presents the basics and has an example for almost every concept it covers. It is also very cheap.This is a good book if you are new to XML or need to learn a few basic concepts to keep up in the work environment, lingo mostly. If you want to create and support XML production level code then this book isn't for you."
5,This is great,"If you plan on learning XML, this is the real deal. Every thing is covered in depth. Castro even mentions how to integrate this with flash to make slide shows, games, and other flash-lets (as I like to call them).Get this book to organize your databases.Get this to make your web page code more concise.Get this book if you are interested at all in any web development fields.This book takes all aspects of the XML language and integrates all that Castro knows into feasible, easy to swallow pieces made for the beginner. Highly rated."

2,:Employ melodic structure,"The multi-genre influential respect is evident, but still these churning numbers evoke little more than inspired exercise at best."
2,Not what promised,"I'm a big slash fan, so I had high expectations of this book-the slash field is so overrun with Lord of the Rings/Harry Potter slash these days that the relatively new genre of environmental slash was tempting enough for me to buy it sight unseen. But Pine never beckoned to Loam with a cunning, crooked smile, eyes half open, gazing at Loam's bulging manhood. It was about, like, geomorphology."
4,For the Hopeless Romantics.......,"This was the first Romance novel I ever read, and I just reread it after reading it atleast three years ago. This book was filled with sadness, action, romance and PASSION! Lorraine was the main character that was very beautiful and had to deal with many hardships in her life. This book will go through her agony and complete happy stages of her life.If you don't like novels with an old setting this isn't for you, but if you love romance novels this is a good read and well written."
2,A bit unstable,"I was impressed with the positive reviews here, but my 13- pound beast pulled this over on himself as soon as he got his claws in it. Hes a strong cat, but you'd think they would wight the bottom of something so large and topheavy. I would not recommend this for large/strong cats."
2,UNBELIEVABLY POOR PACKAGING,"I bought this as a gift for my sister. The item arrived in great shape and on time. HOWEVER, it is a large item and only filled 1/2 of the ridiculously large box it was shipped in. The other half of the box was filled with smaller empty boxes, paper, and random packing materials. I had the task of disposing of the enormous shipping box, plus 4 other boxes and paper.....not too happy. I WILL NEVER BUY FROM PETCO AGAIN IF THEY CAN'T APPROPRIATELY PACKAGE ITEMS. I also wonder how much my considerable shipping fee paid for the shipment of empty boxes which then I got to pay to dispose of."
4,Beautiful trilogy of post-war Germany,"These are amazing, beautiful and stylish films and among Fassbinder's most lush creations. See them if you haven't! I'm just wondering if anyone can help me out by letting me know the name of the violin piece Armin Mueller-Stahl plays in ""Lola?"" I think it's by Bach, but any help would be great. Thanks! (kenzyklez@hotmail.com)"
3,This Item Has No Connection to Battlestar Galactica!,"This collection of films is not related in any way to the series Battlestar Galactica. It has 10 old sci fi flicks. They are: ""In the Year 2888,"" ""Journey to the Center of Time,"" ""Idaho Transfer,"" ""The Day Time Ended,"" ""Star Odyssey,"" ""Warriors of the Wasteland,"" ""Day of the Triffids,"" ""Killers From Space,"" ""Little Shop of Horrors,"" ""Neophites & Neon Lights."" I'm a fan of BSG and was intrigued by the title. It was obvious, when I picked it up, in the store, that it was not connected to my beloved show. I bought it any way, though. ""Day of the Triffids"" alone, made it worth the money. I've yet to watch the other nine films, but I'm confident I'll enjoy at least a few. In conclusion, buy this if you like old ""B"" sci fi films. Don't buy it if your sole interest is Battlestar Galactica."
3,Ros is on her way to the top!,"For a first novel, this is a very good book. Terry and Rosalyn are two very different writers - there is no comparison. But Terry, Look out girlfiend 'cause you've got competition on your heels! Rosalyn is truly a gifted writer. I can't wait till the next one."
1,Maybe a nice beach book--nothing more.,"No, mchapman, I doubt Oprah will buy the rights to this book and make a movie---but maybe Jerry Springer will. This book has no literary value, reads like a voyeur's obsession with the sex lives of strangers. Strangers because Roslyn has not gotten to know the characters well enough to explain them to us. There is a lot here to work with, and Roslyn seems to have enough talent to give the characters some depth and connection with a reality greater than their incongruous surroundings. Maybe subsequent novels can develop each family more thoroughly."
2,Characters and plot were flat and static,"I am so happy that I didn't run out and buy this book, hard or soft cover. Istill feel like I lost out since I spent my time reading it. I hate reading books where black people are so caught up in light skin and long hair. I am not talking about the main character whose hair was falling out (that was a different situation). I am referring to the author always clarifying who had long hair as if this was an indication of the person's self worth. The characters seemed closer to Caucasians rather than African Americans"
3,Decent for a first novel,"I thought ""Knowing"" was, at best, average. I agree with most reviewers -- TOO MUCH SEX!! The sex took away from the story line -- which was weak and unrealistic. It took forever to read but, out of support for her efforts, I finished it. Thank God I checked it out of the library -- I'm glad I didn't buy it. Again, it was a good first novel -- very descriptive and imaginative. Suffice it to say, I look forward to her second novel."
2,Not worth the time,"This is an okay book with a semi-good story line. The beginning of the book really didn't draw me in but as the story started to come together it got better. ""Knowing"" was basically about a selfish husband who didn't want his wife to do anything but be his wife. As the book progressed there was drama with the husband and wife characters, there was tragedy with other characters, and whole lot of sex where I thought I was reading a romance novel. When the book came to the end I was very disappointed with the way it ended because it was very confusing. Actually it made no sense at all. It's your choice whether you want to read this book but it really isn't worth the time. You'll see if you read it."
2,Deja' Phew!,"I based this book on ONE BETTER; I should have known better. KNOWING was a book filled with repetative paragraphs that went nowhere. As usual, nothing picked up until the end, and by then, I didn't care anymore. ONE BETTER led the reader from one situation to another without the constant flashback, which made it a very good read. The only thing this book gave me was a bad case of the flashbacks. Isn't acid or crack-cocaine supposed to do that?"
3,"Slow Start, Powerful Climax, Confusing End","I believe this book is worth buying, however the ending was a disappointment."
2,Pass This Book By,"Unfortunately, I had nothing else to read and I finished the book. The plot is unstable and the main character is boring. You are more interested in the firery sourrounding characters that add a little spice. Once excitement is introduced, it is ignored for the next three chapters and the vague follow up is no longer interesting. This is an over discripitve novel that I didn't enjoy."
1,HATED IT!,"This book had no substance whatsoever. The female character was totally annoying, in fact, all of the characters were annoying. It was an effort to finish this book."
1,I Just Had To Put It Down,"I am lost! In fact, I was so lost when I was reading the book that I couldn't finish it. I simply couldn't deal with it. It is one thing to be descriptive and it is another thing to go into overdrive. It seemed like the author spent more time trying to get the reader to envision the decor than the characters. Maybe the book gets better at the end but I will never find out because I have better books to read and better things to do."
3,Rosalyn McMillan did fairly well with her first book.,"When I had first picked up this book to read, it took me awhile to get into it. After the first one hundred pages, she was able to hold my interest. I felt some parts in the book were predictable. Other than that, it was a good book. I look forward to reading her next book to see if she improved in her writing."
1,"Really, Really Bad","I will not compare one McMillian to the other because Terry's debut novel wasn't very good either. There is nothing I hate more than wasting time on a lousy book and that is in fact what Knowing was. I finished the book KNOWING that the likely hood of purchasing another Roselyn McMillian book is quite small indeed. The characters are void of any redeeming qualities and you wound up not caring what happened to them because they were hopeless. If you must read this book, borrow DON'T buy."
1,This book is the worst book that I have ever read.,"I was totally disappointed in this book. I managed to get to the end, and I felt that I had wasted my time. I kept hoping that the ending would pull the book together and bring some sense to it...it didn't. She should have gotten more advice from her sister, Terry, before going to press!"
4,ok,I agree with some of the reviews. For instance I think that Ginger and Jackson's marriage revolved around to much SEX! This book is full of it. I think some of those scences could have been left out. Other than that it was an OK book.
1,I didn't like it,"The realism is this book was sorely lacking. The story starts at one point and really throws a curve. It was good for smut value, if that's what you go for -- which ocaisionally, I do. Do your self a favor -- buy the paperback. It definitely wasn't worth the hardcover price. Also I don't get her charactor's names. Ginger?!"
3,Not a page turner.,"This novel is shocking me. I am not through reading this book but, so far I am not into it. The book, from what I can see, is all about Ginger getting her groove on all the time. It is a disaster. I wish I could have read your reviews before I bought it."
1,Didn't Like It...,"...and the reasons were: 1. Too descriptive. If your descriptions don't help move the plot forward, don't bother. 2. The multiple storylines. It was like she was jamming five different novels into one. I was asking myself: ""WHAT exactly was this novel about again?"" 3. I really can't complain about the sex--I mean Jackie Collins does it too--yet still it was excessive and seemed only for the purpose of gratification. We didn't need 300 sex scenes to prove that was all Jackson cared about. 4. Things were unrealistic. Like Jackson decides to become a Christian in a paragraph. ...but I don't want to hate on Rosalyn. She had her good moments. And I hope she continues to write and improve through her writing."
2,Stop Killing the Trees!,"What a waste of paper and ink! There were WAY too MANY storylines going on, and I found the characters one dimensional. I did like the incorporation of Ginger's alopecia, and the sex scenes were vivid. However, I just couldn't identify with any of these characters! Too many long descriptions of the scenery! What about character development? Better luck next time."
2,Not worth the time,"This is a below average book with a semi-good story line. The beginning of the book really didn't draw me in but as the story started to come together it got better. ""Knowing"" was basically about a selfish husband who didn't want his wife to anything but be his wife. As the book progressed there was drama with the husband and wife characters, there was tragedy with other characters, and a lot of sex where I thought I was reading a romance novel. When the book came to the end I was very disappointed with the way it ended because it was very confusing. Actually it made no sense at all. It's your choice whether you want to read this book but it really isn't worth the time. You'll see if you read it."
1,I Thought It Was Just Me...,"I thought I was the only person who came away from the book not knowing a thing. That Ms. Millan describes a room to a ""tee"" but leaves her characters flat, one dimensional and unaffective.Nice to know I wasn't the only one. That is wasn't my imagination. That Knowing knew nothing about anything, anyhow, anyway except how to decorate a big fancy house.For those who raved it was the 'best book they ever read', I have wonder about the quality of their reading.No doubt you feel the need to tell a story Rosalyn but folks are going to stop plunking down the bucks if you continue to half step. Sumthin' to think about..."
1,Leave the writing of books to your sister,"The book knowing was an absolute waste of my time. I was so dissapointed in this book. I actually can't even began to tell you where I feel off. I just think Rosalyn in genaral is a sorry writer. She puts to much emphasis on things that really don't need to be written. I just feel her writings suck and so do her books and I hope members of the ""sister circle"" I'm in does not choice another one of her books."
2,This toy broke immediately the first time it was used.,"The shuttle itself is die cast but the tanks are plastic and the small pins that hold them to the shuttle broke off immediately when my son removed them. Then, the tail assembly (which is made of metal) fell off as well. No glue we use to put it back together seems to hold it for long. It's very disappointing and unfortunate, because there doesn't seem to be any space shuttle out there with removable tanks that gets good reviews, and my son wants the whole thing, not just the orbiter by itself."
2,Broke on the first day,"There are 3 pieces: the base, the shuttle, and the orange tank with the rocket boosters attached to it ( they don't separate - very disappointing). The shuttle can hang on tree puny plastic thingies that broke of as soon as my 6 y.o. Started playing with the shuttle. 4.5 inches is the whole thing with the base, so the shuttle itself is smaller, maybe 3 in, but cute."
1,Broken in 5 minutes,All time record for toy breaking. Within 5 minutes the little plastic posts which attach the shuttle to the booster rockets. Don't buy this!
1,Space shuttle,"I purchased many of these for the ""parting gift"" at my son's astronaut party. Unfortunately the tiny pieces that clip everything together break very easily. My son who was initally thrilled with this toy, was very disappointed with minutes of playing with it when these little plastic tabs broke. It would probably be a good cake topper, but not intended to be played with."
1,very bad,"i love techno, trance and dance and lemme tell ya', this ain't it. the songs are slow and repeitive and that's it; they don't go anywhere, there's no complexity and there's no suggestion of any special musical talent that's being restrained or held back to create expectation. don't buy it."
3,no great shakes,"most of the tracks are pretty slow and meandering on this CD -- really not sure where they're headed or what the artist is trying to accomplish with them. and the faster upbeat stuff is not good enough to make up for the slow tracks. the artist does have some potential i believe but he really needs to do a lot more work and development to realize it. maybe if he;d spend more time on his music than on his make-up (is that marylin manson?) he could actually produce some good trance and techno. for now, there are tons of musicians and groups that totally outclass this vath."
4,"Nice story, well told","Nice story that is easy to read and follow. The message of the author is put across well and it is interesting to read how fund-raising for causes works and people's motivations and reactions, alongside the history and problems in Tibet."
5,Great game with multiple strategies,"Incredible game made up of just cards! I really enjoy the game with 2, 3, and 4 players. There's only a small learning curve considering the complexity of the game. A great blend of luck and strategy!"
3,"Just Ok, And NOT Worth the Price!","The documentary on Patriarch Bartholomew was decent, but not worth the money since the entire DVD was about 15 minutes long. The content could have been researched more, and perhaps the film crew could have interviewed more Christians living in Turkey to get their points of view on the unrest and discrimination too. They did a good job interviweing the Patriarch, but I almost felt like they were poking fun at him and not really giving him the respect he deserves. Overall, if you find this documentary elsewhere for less money, get it, but don't waste your money for this very short segment!"
2,Doesn't hold up!,"We gave this to our 6 year old for his birthday and it was broken before bedtime. The base piece that is the remote control and wheels etc. was not made very well and now he cannot make any of the featured robots. He has other Gears sets so he can use the peices for other projects, but this one is very disappointing- especially for the money."
1,Very pooly designed,"Unfortunately, I too have to agree with the other reviews of this toy. Don't buy it, hands down. It shouldn't be purchased for less than 7 years if you do take the chance. The gears are entirely too hard to put together and once they are together, you can't get them apart without adult help. The antenna broke within the first day and for the $50 it cost, it's absolutely ridiculous. However, the idea is wonderful - kids love to play with this guy but he just isn't durable. This toy DEFINITELY needs to go back to the drawing board and constructed of more durable materials and made to withstand the playtime for which it was created. Right now, I'm not sure what I'm going to do with it. It needs to go back for a refund!"
2,"So much potential, but...","My son recieved this as a gift for his 5th birthday. As the other reviewers mentioned the toy falls apart on day one. Several pieces broke off after the first week. The problem is now my son absolutely loves this thing and I am stuck with constantly explaining to him why it is broken and why certain parts don't work, etc. I have glued several of the pieces together to prevent them from falling apart when he uses the remote to make it move. They definitely did not play test this thing well. It's too bad because kids love things with lights and gears and this has it all. If only it would stay in one piece for more than 20 seconds. The instructions are also very complicated as is the building process, so you will have to help any child with this toy. I would not buy this toy, and if you got it as a gift like me, then get the superglue ready."
1,Can I please give this toy 0 stars?,"This toy is too difficult to put together for a 7 year old. It only moves forward and back and the gears don't move together smoothly at all. The site I bought this from was an educational toy site, and did not have reviews on its products. If I had read the reviews as on this site, I would have seen it got 1.5 stars out of 5. I would like to give it a 0. I will return it to the vendor and read reviews next time. Don't buy this. I'm sure there is something better out there."
2,Features wireless IR remote - but breaks easily,"My son got this a year ago for his 6th birthday. He's very careful, smart & follows instructions well. The robot was fairly disappointing. Most kids will lose interest with it if they only build the guy on the box.Not one to worry, we used the parts with our other G!G!G! sets to make all kinds of wonderful things. He's been using the motorized base, which only goes back and forth, to power all sorts of contraptions that don't necessarily ""roll."" But today he dropped it a very short fall, and the antenna/IR receiver snapped.I came to look for parts or to replace - as I said he is extremely good with his toys. However, I can't see buying another whole kit, and this easily broken base isn't available on its own. This is the ONLY G!G!G! set we have that has a WIRELESS remote. The others have wired ones.It's not a toy for most."
3,"Good idea, but poorly made","I was very exited to get this toy for my son, who loves building and creating things. I am disappointed to report that although the robot was tons of fun to create, when he tries to make it move, the parts fall off. My son was very disappointed with this toy. Had I known about the poor quality of this toy, I certainly would not have purchased it."
4,Very Fun!,"My 5 year old son loves this toy. It is a great learning experience with all the gears and how they work together. Sometimes the gears don't stay together very well, but we love it!"
2,Fat beer soaked rock,"I have to say this album kicks. I prefer the second (which I cannot seem to locate anywhere) and third tenderloin offerings better. But make no mistake, you can't go wrong with a little Tenderloin on you!"
5,Excellent book,Every Woman needs to read this book. Wonderful insight and advice about choosing a mate and how to survive the different stages of a marriage.
1,STAY AWAY,THIS IS WORST FROM AMAZON I HAVE BOUGHT SO FAR. I EVEN DID NOT GET REFUND FROM AMAZON SO FAR. I RETURNED THIS PRODUCT ON THE SAME DAY I RECEIVED.
5,Not hard to find anymore!,My mother uses this perfume and it is impossible to find in our area. Received quickly and in perfect condition.
4,Tears of Joy and Pain,"Listening the the DITC brings both pleasure and pain. The pleasure is hearing a piece of true hip hop. This album features instant classics like Thick and Get Yours. The only thing lacking is the lackluster Ebonics Remix. Don't get me wrong L blazed this one ( just like everything else on the album ) but the beat is not Premo's best. The Remix pales in comparison to the original. This album is a classic but sadly the DITC's brightest star didn't live long enough to see it. Big L shows us exactly why he was raps MVP. With his Air Tight lyrics and Unmistakeable Flamboyance. GO Cop the album its a classic. Some think the Greatest rapper of all time died March 9 but the greatest Rapper of all time died on Feb. 15 in Harlem NY. "" My name rings Bidells / I'm hot as hidell / How can you ever mention Harlem and Forget L ""R"
4,Long Awaited!,"I have been waiting for tis CD to come out for the longest time now. Ever since I heard Big L and Fat Joe spit rhymes on the ""Da Enemy"" I new this would be a classic. My only complaint is the quality of the CD recording. It seems like the audio is not too clear."
5,21st century hiphop,"Tommy boy have pulled of one of the best underground lp's since wu tang.Ditc have the skill talent,groundbreaking production from diamond D and a love and respect for hiphop that is missing from todays wack mc's.Plus talented rappers like oc ,showbiz&ag,fat joe and the late bigl and bigpun show what 21st century rapers should sound like."
4,its a good album from the legendary ditc,"this album is a very good album one of the best from 2000, the production is top notch,its the last time you heard original stuff from big l, one of the illest rappers,i mean u couldn't ask for more, u have nothin but two rapper/producers that make dope ass beats.there was some tracks that just didn't belong in the album, but other than that its a good album, it just wasn't promoted that good, thats what happens when u have good rappers in a all star team and then u have these hatin ass a&r's who don't know jack about hip hop.oh well who knows maybe in a couple of years it might be 5 mics."
3,They needed to DIG deeper IN THE CRATES with this!!,"When you amass a collective with the likes of legandary mc's such as O.C., A.G. and BIG L (R.I.P.) with producers like Showbiz, Diamond D, Buckwild, Lord Finesse and DJ Premier you expect greatness. Unfortunately (like Smoka J truely states) we got s'thing alot inferior to this. Why in the good name of Jesus Christ, Cuban Link and Milano got a track I will never know. Also so many tracks were on other projects or are remixed so you get cheated, in a way. Even the normally reliable Buckwild/O.C. collabo(""Champagne Thoughts) was weak compared to other tracks here, abit of a prequel to O.C.'s album ""Bon Apetit"" if you ask me. However when they get it right its the purest hiphop you're likely to hear on any album. Tracks like ""Thick"", ""Get Yours"", ""Way Of Life"", ""Day One"", ""Ebonics"", ""Da Enemy"", ""Tribute"" and ""Time To Get This Money"" make this more of an amazing EP than a great album. Worth copping but at nowhere NEAR that ridiculous price!!"
3,Its good',"The standout MC's are PUN, KRS, & BIG L. Showbiz and the rest of the crew just didn't bring the fire like they usually do. A lot of the time they were outshined by the previous rapper. Beatwise, its flawless. Premier, Diamond D, etc. had some headbangerz that make this album worth coppin!"
3,Didn't Wear Well Over Time,"Having read the well-crafted and interestingly expressed story in Bech's own voice in the latest collection of short stories, ""Licks of Love"", it made me want to go all the back to the original collection of Bech stories. Unfortunately, they're all told in the third person and so aren't nearly as charming. And the experiences of Bech in Communist Europe have little resonance to our time and are not terribly profound. Perhaps the later Bech output is better. This one though is a disappointment. Three stars, of course, because Updike can only be so bad..."
2,bech if you have nothing else to read,It was a tiresome book. The chariter of Bech had no depth. His world was bland as he was. This was my first Updike book and it was a big dissapointment. It is a bath room book for when you have no where else to go.
2,Bech: A Bore,"While not the worst book I have ever read, certainly not noteworthy. Bech is a depressing character and Updike didn't give me any reason to care what happens to the character. Bech is totally self serving. Don't waste your time."
5,GREAT MOVIES,I ALWAYS LIKED LIFETIME MOVIES AND I WAS GOING TO GO BACK EAST ON A PLANE RIDE THAT WOULD LAST 4 HOURS.WATCHED THESE MOVIES AND COULDN'T BE MORE SATIFIED
3,good movies for the price,They were all good movies. If you like tear jerkers you will like this set os movies. I enjoyed them.
2,Inconsistent Connection,"Bottom line, did not live up to expectations and price. Kept getting disconnected and did not get good signal when compared to other Linksys wireless devices I have (PCMCIA Card and Wireless USB Network Adapter). I am a big fan of Linksys, but I would pass on this device."
4,Some entertaining music.,"I think this CD is pretty good, if you arent looking for serious Latin music. But I would definately recomment buying it to anyone who wants to listen to the Macarena without buying the whole ""Los del Rio"" album."
3,Paint Not Perfect,"I was waiting in anticipation to receive this pink Le Creuset crock, however, when it arrived, I noticed the paint job was not in perfect condition. It looked as though there was a smear of white in the pink paint job of the crock. I don't think this is typical of Le Creuset items, so needless to say, I was a bit disappointed with this particular item."
4,Bravo Ozon!!!!,"I give it up to Francois Ozon for making a film that takes a chance. At first I had no idea what the movie was really about. All I was able to gather from trailers and such was that it was about a special baby... a very special baby.The movie is delightful. I feel the ending was a little unexplained but perhaps that was the point!? Babies come into our lives for different reasons. I would say some save our lives and others help us realize things we'd never thought possible before. Perhaps I'm diving too deep into this but the ending I feel is left open to interpretation.Francois Ozon is a great filmmaker and we're lucky to have him working on projects that are personal to him but yet universal enough to keep us intrigued.Personal favorites are Swimming Pool, Time To Leave, Angel-despite being a little too melodramatic and now Ricky."
4,Enjoyable movie...for the adults in your family.,"The description of the movie pretty much sums it up. It's in French with English subtitles. It was very enjoyable, but while most of it would be OK for kids to watch some of the subject matter is just for the adults."
4,long lasting and tasty,I have lost 10 pounds having a sucker before meals. They are delicious and 120 caps. Ea. (I called the company).I love the strawberry and mocha the best. (I would love to order these only)
5,Delicious,"These are the best suckers I have ever tasted. They claim to last an hour, but personally they last me 40 minutes. Each one has about 100 calories. In my area (average cost of living for the US), I can also find them sold separately in stores at a price of anywhere from $0.50 to $3.75 per sucker, before taxes.These suckers really are extremely tasty."
3,Not as good as Mannheim Steamroller,I didn't read the description of this CD before purchsing. I thought it was music by Mannheim Steamroller but it is NOT. The music is still nice but as I stated above not as good as Mannheim Steamroller.
4,Very good CD,"Bought this CD back in the late 90's and have enjoyed listening to it through the years. I like the more upbeat songs such as Hark!, Wenceslas and Joy to the World the best. Nice tribute to Mannheim and a very good CD in its own right."
4,Just beautiful folk-y indie music,"I've had this album for a couple years since I heard Dean play live. I can play this from start to finish and love it just the same every time. For me, favorites are In and Out and Irish Bars."
5,Soul Stirring,"Awesome, soul stirring book that chronicles the journey of a young man from a boy into a purposeful and passionate man."
5,For anyone on a journey.....,"This book cuts through the often simple face we put on Christianity, that is it a journey that we are on. It faces the insecurities we all have, not ignoring that they are there. In this book I saw an individual seeking life, and ultimately found his place in the arms of God. This book was one that made me laugh, and cry (esp the last chapter), and left me desiring to know my place on this earth and in light of the Creator I call friend. I would recommend to Christian and non-Christian alike, because it puts a real face on the choice that we all must make. Read and enjoy!"
5,Philly Got it Now!,"Better Than The first. Good for the Car, good for the cypher, good to just let loose and vibe. Must Have for any Roca Head."
4,Whatever you think about it!,"Great CD, If you don't have it you should go out and get it. Strictly for the streets. Touches deep down in your heart. Everything is real; no acting! I'm out."
2,Roc-A-Fella's Mediocre Release,"State Property dubbed themselves the most listened to Philly natives in the game now...boy did Philly get a bad rep on this one. State Property's second release the ""Chain Gang Vol.2"" is..well...to put in simple words..GARBAGE.Poor performances by all 7 members of the group, although Oschino clearly shined on 1 or 2 tracks.The Young Gunz are a disapointment, the hope that this young rap duo will flourish is gone after this release. Only notable tracks are the first 3, and ""G.A.M.E"" ( only because it featured the streets very own...Lil'Cease). Words can't describe the disapointment that Roc-A-Fella fans recieved witt this one."
4,"Surprise, Surprise","This cd was not just good but it was REALLY GOOD. Each song is a banger. And I'm not just saying that becuse to be honest I am not a Roc A Fella fan, but now they have me wondering if my judgement of their earlier work was incorrect!"
4,GOOD ALBUM. 4.5 STARS,"Roc-A-Fella Records Just Keeps Getting Better & Better. State Property Is A Group Of Rappers From Philladelphia Named ""Beanie Sigel, Freeway, Peedi Crack, Oschino, Sparks, Neef & Chris"".The Best Songs On This Album Are ""Can't Stop, Won't Stop"", ""It's On"", ""B.B Gun"", ""Just Another N***a"", ""G.A.M.E"" & ""Rollin' Down The Freeway"". Overall This Is A Great CD And Is Definitely Worth Buying."
2,"Good, but....","The only other album I own is the self titled album. I remember the growls and beautiful voice of Liv. I never even bothered with the albums where they decided to go techno-industrial or what ever that crap was. I am always looking for the operatic sounds when I am looking for new music. It's getting harder to find bands like that anymore. Seems like everytime you find one they only put out one album or one ep and then it's over. Case in point..Eyes Without Face..great!! But they only put out an ep and thats it. This album is okay, but, after hearing the whole thing I was bored. The new female singer is way too poppy, her voice never changes on any of the songs. I felt at times I was listening to Collide. I guess she can't sing operatic style. The rest of the vocals are just boring and not uplifting at all. Almost seems that they are trying to get into that Nu-Metal market and appeal to the younger crowd. So..okay, but, nothing special."
3,Great Music but...,"I have to agree with other reviewers who dislike the male vocals... I'd really like this, probably 5 stars, if they had a good male singer. The female vocals are excellent and the music content is excellent. My very favorite kind of music is actually male/female duet where each sings their part, and occasionally sing together. On this album, in my opinion, the male singer just ruins it. It would be much better with just her since his singing is like background noise.So, sadly, 3 stars instead of 5..."
2,A freshman work.,"Suffice it to say, Mr. Chabon became a more disciplined, focused, and skilled writer with practice and age. Much like hearing a demo of a great song, one can hear evidence of the greatness in the demo, but the demo itself doesn't stand alone. The same can be said with this book. In the Chabon canon, people will look at this years from now and see the techniques and styles being practiced in The Mysteries of Pittsburgh that made Chabon what he is. Then they will go on to read his works of polish and quality."
4,A Coming of Age,"It is not common for an emerging writer to generate a great deal of attention for their first novel, but Michael Chabon received just that for his novel, The Mysteries of Pittsburg. Although not as critically acclaimed as some of his later works, in particular his Pulitzer Prize winning novel, The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, this novel has received a lot of attention from critics since its release in 1989.This book clearly portrays his skills as a writer as well as his knack for creating vivid, life-like characters. This book also displays his tendency to be somewhat verbose throughout certain junctures of the story and other weaknesses in his writing that are improved upon in his later works. Overall this book is a wonderful example of a skilled writer who is coming of age."
4,Not his best effort,"I love most of Chabon's works (Cavalier and Klay and Wonder Boys are favorites), but I found this earlier work to be less focused and more reliant on cookie-cutter characters. A rambling tale with some interesting points, but none of the characters drew me in the way his later works have. I've also found his similies/metaphors with smells and tastes to become distracting."
5,The Graduate X,"As Twain said,don cek the spellin! Growing up in the south you are shelltered in a way from the same broad panarama (God I sound like my Lit Prof! )...... sorry. I loved this book because it combined the time I grew up in the 60s and the new generations ideals that I feel havent changed as much as we think.I just turned 40 and am getting married 1 month from today,so I know that the search is the most important, as the loveexplored here in this book explaines. Gay or Straight love is love,even us ol Texas boys know that! you see Pittsburg were not all the same down here.we love a good book also,and by the way, if you ever come dowm to Texas, stop on by,relax,and come see Scott and Cheryll in Longview,Tx."
2,Flawed First Novel,"I wanted to like this novel more . . . I desperately hoped that it would be good enough to justify reading some of his later works--- But I just wasn't that impressed. His control of prose was good. I liked his metaphors [e.g., describing a suburban house's garden-hose as a ""French horn"" hung on the house]. But the main character was sniveling, weak and unlikeable. I felt as much antipathty toward him as his father did--and I suspect that that wasn't the author's intent.Maybe I'm too ""old-fashioned"" in my literary tastes--but a girl named ""Phlox,"" the many celebrations of ""alternative sexual drives,"" the adolescent urges to ""shock"" all left me cold.Too bad.I really wanted to like him more--or, if not like him, than admire his talent to such an extent that it would overcome my personal repugnance to him as a man. But, alas, such was not the case."
3,"Mysterious in its Time, Not So Much Now","When Michael Chabon penned ""The Mysteries of Pittsburgh"" in 1988, it was hailed as an heir to ""On the Road,"" ""The Catcher in the Rye,"" and ""The Great Gatsby."" While Chabon would go on to pen many important novels, ""The Mysteries of Pittsburgh"" isn't in the same category as ""Wonder Boys"" or his Pulitzer-award winning ""Kavalier and Clay."" The dialogue is overwrought, the descriptions pained, and the plot meandering (its only connection to ""On the Road,"" presumably). Michael Chabon is a literary genius...but ""The Mysteries of Pittsburgh"" is interesting only as an insight into his genesis."
5,"Lovely, stylish.","Michael Chabon has provided the great breakthrough for gay writers. More than David Leavitt, he brought the gay sensibility mainstream. ""Mysteries of Pittsburgh,"" with its campy plot and over-the-top language, is exquisite."
5,One of my all time favorites,"I think the ""literary critics"" have beaten this book to death. Let me just say that I found the story to be as entertaining as the charaters were loveable. Of course, it doesn't hurt that Chabon puts sentences together quite nicely."
4,Expected,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I lived in Pittsburgh, had classes with the author, and recognize composites of many characters of the Oakland (University of Pittsburgh) area and time. The author was a gifted writer as an undergraduate, and captures both the essence of Pittsburgh and the ""feel"" of being twenty-something at that time in an urban area."
5,Micheal Chabon's great debut,"Micheal Chabon's novel ""The Mysteries of Pittsburgh is sugar for the eyes.In my opinion, this novel helps us to get to know us better. The relationships between the protagonist and a girl, his father, his best friend and his gay friend probably are able to show us some useful facts about love, friendship, family affairs and sexuality. Because of the protagonist being about 23 makes it easy to transfer his problems in the situations of us as teenagers. The development of the main character getting out of his childhood and learning to get independent and self confident somehow is an instruction for how to live our lives.Reading it at school is in my opinion not so suitable, because the volume of interpretations is almost incountable and takes too much time. Also the colloquial language used by Chabon will maybe be disliked by a lot of teachers.So it is better to read the novel in your freetime and to get your own picture of it, than to deal with it at school."
3,These Jewish boys always want to be liked?,"It is a long way from a baseball Peter Pan to an homosexual MOB boss' son. His father finally refuses to accept the charges.Originally it appears his future girl friend sent her guy library friend to rope him,but what she ends up doing is involving him with two self destructive new friends. Except for off color sexual content the book is very well written. It is a bit verklempt."
3,First effort,"Chabon's first effort is not bad. Precious like most first novels, auto-biographical in large chunks one assumes, superb on multiplicities of sexualities. Finely written and, barring the dubious gangster plot, well worth your attention. Then move to ""Kavalier and Clay"" and be expanded!Jason RosenfeldTerrible cover design, by the way."
4,A Promising Start,"Chabon's first novel is extreme, over-the-top... and a sign of the brilliance to come in his career as a novelist. On top of that, Mysteries of Pittsburgh is a fun and funny book. In true Chabon form, it's hard to tell what to expect or what will come next -- is this a story about college friends, or a summer of partying, or budding bisexuality, or gangsters and gunfights? The answer: Yes. All of these elements are stirred together in this short book that can be read in an afternoon, and relatively successfully. While there are bumpy and awkward moments, Mysteries of Pittsburgh will please anyone who enjoyed Kavalier and Clay or who saw the film of Wonder Boys and wants a taste of the novelist who penned its inspiration."
2,Rubbish,"I suppose there's something to be said for an aimless, sexually confused, crybaby of a protagonist...but someone else is going to have to say it because I sure can't find the words.The story centers around recent college grads in Pittsburgh as they deal with life, love, careers, friends and families (or the lack of all of the above). Having attended college in Pittsburgh (and fallen in love there) not long before this novel was published in 1988, I was hoping for a trip down memory lane by an accomplished novelist. I did recognized many of the places described but alas, the characters were uninteresting, the situations didn't ring true, and the prose often seemed overblown. I can't remember being so disappointed over a novel that came so highly recommended."
2,Over-rated,"I found this book tedious going. I mean, a whole chapter dedicated to two characters playing ""Twister""???? (that did not further the story at all?) The language was contrived in its literary prententiousness, the metaphors and similes were contrived. (A porno mag drops out of a book at the protagonist's book store job, ""like a severed arm."" (!!) Uh..okay). The book reeked of something written by a (post)adolescent. (Not a compliment). Maybe if you're gay, or live in Pittsburgh (or both) this will be enjoyable. Otherwise, I can't recommend it. I actually bought my copy of PITTSBURGH at a book signing, and met Mr. Chabon when he signed my copy. He was very articulate, well-mannered, and seemed a sensitive and nice fellow. So when I opened the book the first time, I WANTED to like it. But I just couldn't. No matter how hard I tried. (So I still have a signed hardcover, first edition copy of the book. Is it worth something?)"
2,not much of a story,"I found this a depressing and rather disconnected story. Maybe I lack the sophistication to appreciate his writing, but this did not inspire me to read more by this author."
1,steel city sludge...,"Yikes! Boy, was this painful to read! I found this book to be incredibly boring. I haven't read anything else by the author, but he should thank his marketing campaign for selling to the public a pretty lame first effort. I hope his other efforts are better than this turgid novel. There's nothing in this book to recommend it."
1,Immature and Unrealistic Book,"There might be a minority of gays in the Republican Party, but there is definitely an overrepresentation in contemporary literature, and intellectual elitists call these works avant-garde, like Guide by Dennis Cooper and Less Than Zero by Bret Easton Ellis, which paint the impression that privileged young men are always unsure about their sexuality and smoke pot and have one night stands with men. Michael Chabon is a much better writer than the other two, but he also shroud his characters in the same inaccurate light. The Mysteries of Pittsburgh is a very fragmentary and immature piece of work about a college student named Art having bisexual trysts. The characters are very stereotypical, and seemed to be put together by super glue. This Side of Paradise and The Catcher in the Rye it is definitely not. If you really have to be immersed in cultural cliches and unrealistic narrative, read The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay. At least you can learn some new words."
2,not so good,"The chapter titles in The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, ... were alluring to the fullest when I first flipped through the pages before reading. I also examined the cover of the book and focused on the words ""the acclaimed New York Times bestseller."" I thought, if this book could have the New York Times not only stamp their approval but also put the fancy word ""acclaimed"" in the sentence, then by golly I was sold. Judging a book by its cover was my new motto.The level of ease of reading the book was child's play ...Soon after breezing through a few chapters, however, the child's play also became a child's book. Suddenly, and occurring too often in my maturing stage of life now that I think about it, I felt like I was in sixth grade. The easy read was just that, an easy read. Instead of some type of depth, Michael Chabon took the readers along a 297-page book that could probably be explained and done with in two minutes."
4,Not an Action Thriller,"A young man just out of college shares his strangley wild summer with us. I found the confused, somewhat scared, and sexually undeclared Art to be sympathetic and believable. I may have met people like him- I'm not sure. Many passages evoked appreciative laughter, whether from absurdity or poignancy. Reading that Jane did so, I started using curry and nutmeg together in my salad dressing. (Also in vegetable juices.) It's great."
3,Pretty Good - 3 Stars,"Read this book due to the many (unwarranted) comparisons to Salinger's Catcher in the Rye. It's a good book with wonderful prose and beautifully written sentences. However, not near the quality of any of Salinger's efforts. I found it hard to relate to the underdeveloped characters. It also appears as if the author simply got lazy at the end. That last paragraph is pointless and unnecessary and I wasn't fond of the ""borrowed"" Outsiders ending."
4,Classic College Lit,"I loved Chabon's ""Wonder Boys"" and heard good things about this book. It's well-written, and the characters are fleshed out very well."
4,"Acid Mothers Temple - 'Born To Be Wild In The USA, 2000' (Wabana)","Thought this live CD would be worth purchasing for me, specially because I got to see the Acid Mothers fairly recent. As a live release, it's not bad. Only problem is I could've SWORN I had seen a bio of this disc that noted it ran over 75 minutes in length. Fact is it's only forty minutes long. Still, it sounds really good, plus I'll assume maybe they were support for another band. Total of five tracks here, ""Acid Tokion 2000"" (7:41), the way-out there ""La Novia"" (13:38), the familiar sounding ""Pink Lady Lemonade"" (8:06), the noisy ""Speed Guru"" (9:52) and ""God Bless Acid Mothers Temple"" (1:20). ACID MOTHERS TEMPLE freaking RULES!! Space rockers, you have a wake-up call. YEEEEEEEEEEEEEAH!!"
1,There's Nothing New Here,"I heard this song on the radio the other day, and I was like,""Lord have mercy! What in the world is?"" This song sounds like it's attempting to have an old school flavor mixed with club, but it's not really working. It sounds a complete mess. X-tina's voice sounds digitally enhanced and sped up. And like always, she's still doing the vocal acrobatics. *yawn* Other than that, ""Ain't No Other Man"" is forgetable and is nothing new."
5,A Phenomonal Album!,"OMG! I can't BELIEVE there are only two reviews for this fantastic album! As is all of Jill's material - it's full of really smart, really funny, heartfelt and incisive songs.'ve been a big Jill Sobule fan for ages and ages. It's always tough to know which album to start new fans with, but this one is a great place to start. I've given this album as a present to quite a few girlfriends, and they've all LOVED it and ALL reported how much the listened to it over and over and over and over again - as I did when I first got it.Jill's just a terrific songwriter - each song is like a perfect little short story all in its own right. The songs are also really fun to sing along to, and really easy to relate to. I've always been amazed that Jill isn't more widely known.Definitely get this album - and then all her others. And if you ever get a chance to see her live, go - she puts on a terrificly fun show."
4,good stuff,"Jill Sobule writes pop music with intelligence, heart, sarcasm and wit. In other words, she's just too good to ever be famous."
5,Better and Better,"Until I heard her work I thought Jill Sobule was just another one of the blonde bimbo, ala Jewel types. Boy, was I wrong! She's musically talented, lyrically witty, and socially pithy. She's a songwriter that can give Elvis Costello (brillant as he is) a run for his money. You'll never get tired of listening to this or any of her works. There's always another level in the music and lyrics to discover!"
4,Strong follow up to Happy Town,"One of the best ""singer/songwriter"" albums of 2000. While not quite capturing the pure listening satisfaction of one of her live shows, this disk is still a strong collection full of inventive lyrics and catchy hooks. Overall a great listening experience, but for Jill Sobule beginners, I would recoment her more immediately accessable self titled album."
3,"Starts with a bang, ends with a whimper","After hearing ""One Of These Days"" one time on the radio, I waited anxiously for this album to be released. I realized immediately that I was not a big Jill Sobule fan. Her talent is obvious, it's just not really my cup of tea. One Of These Days is really a terrific song...the lyrics made me literally laugh out loud, especially ""one of these days/I'm going to touch the sky/like that awful song/'I believe I can fly.'"" I identified with the lyrics especially since I hated that song, but most of the rest of the album left me cold...it was just a bit too quirky for me."
2,Beware the cult of Jill,"If you are considering buying this or any Jill Sobule album, by all means listen to an audio sample to see whether you can tolerate her affected, cloying school girl voice. It recalls the kids on Fame, or possibly Zoom. She should be singing with muppets. If you like your pop tempered any degree of grittiness, avoid Jill Sobule."
4,Outstanding Unknown Gem from the Golden Age of Shoegaze,"God I love this CD. It brings back memories of the golden age of shoegazer in the very early 90's. Back then I was listening to Medicine, My Bloody Valentine, The Drop Nineteens, Slowdive, et al and remember feeling priviledged to bear witness to such a beautiful and creative movement. This is an unknown album which is criminal because it is so good. There are a number of outstanding songs on the CD and no bad ones. Although it is not quite as good as My Bloody Valentine or Medicine, it is a notch below and well worth investing in if you have even the slightest interest in that ramarkable period. I'd compare the style to an upbeat Chapterhouse, or a quiter Medicine. Its very different from bands like Slowdive or Ride in that it is almost dancey but not quite. Listen to it and enjoy it. This is a must buy."
4,Intended for the first time owner of a digital camera.,"This is the perfect book for the first time owner of a digital camera. The author explains basic terminology and how pixels and resolution effect the photographs, and guides the reader through how to transfer, edit, process and archive the photos.It is not a guide on how to take photos, nor is it highly technical. It is designed for the first time user answering many of the questions and easing the confusion felt when entering the digital world. I am buying it for my sister-in-law and my 75 year old father, who both recently purchased cameras and are struggling with the understanding what resolution to use, how to print the photos, etc.I wish I had this book years ago when I purchased my first digital camera."
1,"Nippers dont line up. Be aware that they are 12 inch, best used for minis NOT riding horses or anything large!","Nippers blades didnt line up. The ad fails to mention that these are only 12 inch nippes, and best used for minis or small ponies. I do not recommend these be used for a riding horse or anything larger. Even though I havent used my nippes yet I doubt that they are as sturdy as the ad says because they dont line up. Like I said they would be good for a mini."
4,Great book for first-time owners,"This book is absolutely amazing when it comes to educating an owner about their Maltese. I bought it to learn a little about my dog and how to groom him. It did tell most of what I needed to know. There are a ton of good pictures to show you how you can groom your Maltese. I learned a lot about his personality-style, history, and training as well."
4,Maltese book,Pretty good information. There were several questions that I had that were not covered in the bool.
1,Not complete,"Overall, this book gives you a general idea of owning a Maltese. However it is far from informative. Compared to the books from the same publisher but of different breeds, this book does not contain sufficient information. Some pictures are cute, but some others merely does not reflect the beauty and the elegance of the Maltese breed. A few pictures were so yellowish that it seemed like the Maltese has a yellow coat, which is misleading to owners who are not familiar with the Maltese breed. This book does not contain sufficient information on the topic of breeding and preparation. The author spent over 3 pages just to talk about the history of the Maltese breed. The author gives unrelated info, such as the AKC standard of the Poodle. This book needs to be revised."
5,"""Hold your hats and hallelujah.""",I LOVE IT!!! Bernadette is FANTASTIC! and so is the rest of the cast!!! LOVE IT!!!
3,There Are Better Recordings,"As a fan of Gypsy, I bought this CD just to see what Gypsy was up to these days. I am sad to say I was not impressed at this recording at all. First of all, there's Bernadette Peters. I mean no offense, but she sounds just plain worn out in this recording. The rest of the cast is fine, but really don't add anything new to the show. The recording itself is good. But the fact that I didn't like Bernadette Peters at least in this recording just spoils this whole cast album for me. Ethel Merman is better and so is Angela Lansbury."
5,Everything's Coming up Roses,"This is totally the best recording of Gypsy, I simply adored it. Bernadette is amazing as Mamma Rose, everyone told she wasn't ""strrong"" enough to do those songs but they sound perfect, specially You'll never get Away from me, Everything's Coming Up Roses and Rose's Turn. Tammy Blanchard is probably the best Gypsy ever, her voice is lovely and you can feel the evolution from ""Little Lamb"" to ""The Strip"", in my oppinion, she's this revival's star. ""You gotta get a gimmick"" is hilarious. This soundtrack is packed of great voices, great songs and great stars!"
5,Great!,"I saw the show the night before they recorded the CD. Bernadette had been sick a couple of weeks before and was never able to fully recuperate. You'll Never Get Away From Me seemed to be a little too low for Bernadette to sing (since her voice wasn't in top shape)- I noticed that on the recording as well. Little Lamb isn't that great-the song has never been a favorite of mine anyway. The rest of the CD is just great! Both Baby June & Louise are very talented. I especially recommend Small World (Bernadette & John Dossett do an amazing job), If Momma Was Married (The harmony is fabulous) and Rose's Turn (Great Song performed by the greatest talent on Broadway)."
5,"The Absolute Best ""Gypsy"" CD of All Time!!!","I saw the new revival of ""GYPSY"" on Broadway with Bernadette Peters this past weekend. And I have to say, of all the shows I've seen in New York (which are many!) this one was BY FAR the absolute best show!I was first in line at my local music store to buy this CD when it was released. IT'S AMAZING! Bernadette is PERFECT to play Mama Rose! The rest of the cast is excellent as well.I defietly recommend this CD to ANYONE looking for a good ""GYPSY"" recording! This is WELL worth every penny!"
5,Just as good as the live show,"I went and saw this show in New York earlier this year and it was phenominal. I'm happy to say that this CD is not much different. Bernadette Peters delivers one of her best performances ever in this show and the cd captures every minute of it. So if you are a big fan of Bernadette Peters, I'd highly recommend this album.If you are a big Gypsy fan, I would also recommend this cd to add to your collection. It has the same old spark to it as the earlier casts do, and a nice new ring with the fresh voices.And if you just plain love music, this is a wonderful addition to anyone's music collection. If you need to spruce up your musical selection of music, I would highly recommend this album since it has the favorite quality of the older musicals (ie the music man), but has the familiar voices of the stars of today.So, unless you dispise musicals, I'd recommend this CD to anyone and everyone. ENJOY! Here she is boys!"
1,Bad Casting,"I first saw Bernadette Peteres perform her role as Mama Rose on the Tony Awards 2003 and was very, very disappointed. I was twice disappointed with the CD. She is totally wrong for this part. What were the Producers thinking when they picked her to play Mama Rose. She does not have the voice to belt out the songs that Gypsy is famous for."
2,MISS PETERS IS TOTALLY MISCAST AS MAMA ROSE!!!,"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT THIS CD IS!!!! MISS PETERS IS A TALENTED SINGER AND PREFORMER....but SHE IS TOTTALY MISCAST AS MAMA ROSE!HER VOICE IS TOTALLY WRONG FOR THE CHARACTER...SHE JUST DOESN""T HAVE IT.. THE STRONG VOICE THE CHARacter NEEDS.. SHE IS NOT A BELTER.... THE CHARACTER NEEDS TO BE STRONG .. and MISS PETERS SOUNDS VERY HOARSE... HER BABY DOLL VOICE DOESNT FIT MAMA ROSE. THIS IS THE WORST VERSION OF ""GYSPY"", EVEN ROSALIND RUSSELL SOUNDS BETTER THAN MISS PETERS!!!"
1,Sondheim-give up music!,"From the amtauer who plagued us with ""Sweeny Todd"" and ""Into The woods"" comes yet ANOTHER lackluster dud!Lackluster music and horrible screeching by tone-deaf people,this CD proves that Sondheim is just a copycat composer trying to be just like the great Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber.Sondheim just jots down any old words,hoping they'd make a song,and he tosses together a bunch of people who've never had any music lessons in their lives and tells them to play on musical instruments.If you want to punish yourself or give yourself headsplitting migraines,then buy this album-you'll be miserable in 1 second."
4,"See the show, and you'll understand the CD","Frankly, the fourth star is for the engineering of this CD. THe sound is crisp and forward. Angel is fast becoming one of the better labels for this genre. (BMG's entire catalog from the 80s needs to be remastered)I wish they would have waited a month or two to record the CD. Ms. Peters just came off a bout with bronchitis and it really shows on the CD. She's hoarse in places and you can hear her strain to get to notes in others. But the acting is phenomenal. I saw the show in September and was amazed at how much better it sounded. Ms. Peters had relaxed vocally and deppened emotionally.The find on the CD is Tammy Blanchard, with Little Lamb, one can actually close your eyes and see the classic scene of Louise and her lamb.And I totally agree with those who have said this is one of the best recordings of Rose's Turn.Recap: Buy the CD, listen for the nuances in line readings and enjoy the orchestra and overall sound quality."
2,Where's the Recording with Maureen Moore?,"I had the pleasure of seeing this on Broadway without Bernadette Peters. She was out for the night and her cover, Maureen Moore, was magnificent! Ever since I saw a ghastly community college production of Gypsy in 1974, I've dreaded productions of this brilliant musical. The performance I saw on Broadway changed all that! Maureen Moore was an amazing Rose. She had me crying at the First Act finale, and I was sobbing as all that emotion poured out of her on ""Rose's Turn."" She brought Gypsy to life for me. Tammy Blanchard was a terrific Gypsy, and John Dossett was a fantastic Herbie. I'd even consider seeing a seriously miscast Peters in this, but hope that Maureen Moore becomes a star after playing those performances that Peters misses!Where is her CD of that outstanding performance? Get the Merman or the Lansbury recordings instead. They're far better in this role!"
1,Don't Bother - This CD is the worst!,"Bernadette Peters as Madame Rose in ""Gypsy"" is one of the worst casting ideas of all time!Peters is a great performer, but this role is simply wrong for her. This latest ""Gypsy - Broadway Cast"" CD makes this painfully clear. In addition, the entire CD is a sub-standard version of this great classic score.Buy the original 1959 cast album with Ethel Merman. The Bette Midler TV version is a close second. The later Broadway revival cast albums with Angela Lansbury and Tyne Daly are so-so, but this latest version is definitely at the bottom of the barrel.Besides the sadly miscast Peters, the whole production sounds like a bad high school play. Skip it! Go for ANY other version than this."
4,"Awesome, but don't raise your hopes.","This Action Replay works well! But don't raise your hopes... You might not get a code manager disk with it. I bought it even though I had a different one, but I didn't have the cord. I had the disk and the action replay. The new one came w/o the disk. I think you can install the code manager anyway, just read the manual. Once you get the hang of it, you will have lots of fun with it, and I recommend buying it. Thank you, Datel!"
1,ok,now i have a problem i bought a action replay but it was a datel action replay like for 3ds/dsi xl/ds lite but Anyways i wanted the regular action replay the one where you put the ds game instead the action replay but i couldnt cause it was closed up and i was hella mad anyways i wanna make sure i get the ds lite action replay like the picture is suppose to be :(
1,Its not worth it DO NOT BUY,First off i got the dsi version... Wrong ORDER!!!! and the dsi version did work and was fun for an hour and ten didnt work at all totally B.S Not worth your time or money DO NOT BUy
1,It Broke!,"I love action replay, but something went wrong. The action replay won't get into my DSi. I have to TAPE it in there. I liked it at first, being able to get a fateful encounter Meloetta, but then it stopped working and it went RRRRRRRRRRRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYUUUUUUUUUUYUUOOOOOOOPOOOOOOOOOOO.And I REALLY want a Deoxys. And thenI forgot that action replay didn't work and I threw a regular poké ball at Terrakion"
1,:-(,I bought the Action Replay for my 10 yr old son. Neither my desktop or laptop would recognize the device to download new game codes. (I went online to discover that many people are having the same problem.) But my son was still happy with the Action Replay because it already had some codes available on the device. It did recognize a couple of the games he already owned. But what was really disapointing was that it only worked up until a couple days ago. My son got only a month of playing time before it died. When the Action Replay did work...he did enjoy it though. Right now he's begging for another one. Maybe we just got a lemon.
2,A lot of issues,"This is a cool product with a lot of support online, however despite the online support, updates, etc., this product still is far from perfect. ALMOST EVERY GAME I use with it initially says ""UNKNOWN GAME"" even though in the manual it states this ""rarely happens"" and is due to different versions of the game being released. It doesn't rarely happen, it almost always happens. It is a lengthly process to get by this which the support for the product describes, and even after going through it, it still doesn't always recognize the game and therefore you cannot use the provided codes with it.its a shame, because it is a cool product, and like I said, its obvious that the company has put in a lot of work to provide support for it. Unfortunately, at least in my experience, its more of a pain then its worth. Beware of this."
4,exactly as described,arrived quickly and in excellent condition with packaging and instructions. was easy to set up and use but unfortunately my son damaged it just after 1 week :( I'll probably end up getting another one for him soon.
1,"Be careful what you buy,","Tried getting two operating systems (XP with SP2 and Vista) to recognize this product but neither would(I followed the instructions to the ""T""). The manufacturer provides no response when attempting to troubleshoot the issue. I would not waste my money on the Action Replay. My son ended up being the most upset/frustrated by this device not working. Your money would be better spent on a game or a player's guide or something."
1,Worst purchase ever,"I don't usually write reviews, but I would feel really guilty not to let other people know how bad this product is after what my son just went thru. My son wanted this item very badly for Christmas, but he didn't get it. After reading the reviews, I warned him that it looks like that this item breaks very easily, but he wanted to take the chance, so I decided to get him one. He was so excited that he couldn't wait for the item to be shipped; therefore, I decided to take him to a store and bought it for him. He was so so happy. For my surprise, all in a sudden, he screamed crying: ""Mom, it is broken!"". The fun lasted about 2 hours. Now, he is more upset than ever, feeling that he did something wrong. I know that he did nothing wrong. It is just a real bad product. I feel very bad because this thing really ruined his Christmas."
1,More junk from the codejunkies,"This thing doesn't work, period. The operator's manual is absolutely the worst manual I have EVER read. A useless product. You are throwing your money away if you purchase this thing."
1,THE WORST THING EVER!,"The cover tricks you by saying it has codes that work. It doesn't! I gotmine at a Gamestop in a mall closest to me. It worked for Super Mario Bros. & only the Dalmation & Friends nintendogs version and when I tried to load more of the games I had on to the game, it took more than 3 days to be done with it. then when I tried to use it, it wouldn't even come on! You know how when you turn the DS on, it comes up with a screen that you can choose your game, or pictochat it totally skipped that! But when I put in a nintendo gane, it worked. So I returned it a week later and got my money back. The guy that worked there said he got 9 out of 10 back. So I recommend staying away from it. LISTEN< IF YOU BUY IT CONSIDERD YOUR SELF WARNED!!"
1,not updated... and the update killed it!,it was out of date so i got eh firmware update from the site. this killd the card. I have not heard back from the site about replaceing it either
1,Did not recieve what I ordered!!!!,"I ordered the DS Lite Action Replay and was sent a Action Replay DS EZ and I am not happy with it. I refuse to spend my hard earned money to make a long distant call to this company to tell them to send me what I ordered. I am so tired of online companies takeing my money and not sending me what I ordered without notifing me that the item that I order is no longer availbe and a replayment will be sent or ask if I want my money back. What has happened to the customer service in this world today. I recomend that you do not buy from this company as you may not get your exact order.Sep. 9, 2011...updateInstead of wasting my time ans fuel to send this item back i kepted it. I just opened it and found that it would not work in my DS lite so i put it in my orignal DS and it worked. If i could give this item 0 stars I would. I strongly recommend that you ""DO NOT"" buy this item from this seller."
4,Not what the 8yr old expected,"He was very excited to be getting the ""cheats"" for his Pokemon, but this wasn't the version he thought he was getting. This required his father, who doesn't like the concept of cheats, to help him put it on using the computer.He was very happy with it once he convinced his dad to do so, but still if you are looking for something that the kids can do themselves there is apparently a version that just goes into the DS itself. This is NOT that version."
4,Wrong product but it worked OK,"I was excited to recieve the action replay after searching for it stores unsuccessfully for about a month. But when I recieved it in the mail, I was a bit confused. The product I ACTUALLY recieved was called Action Replay DS EZ. I never heard of it before and I had to look up how to actually use it. After figuring it out I concluded that it would meet my needs and decided to keep it. The seller was lucky I liked the product he sent me or else I would have returned it in a heartbeat. The Action Replay DS EZ is a pretty good product, it wasn't what I asked for when purchasing though. Keep that in mind."
2,problems with something I didn't have,My cousin bought the action replay. I watched my cousin use his ds lite with action replay. The problem was that first he had to get his ds lite to freaze in the beging. Since I really needed his games help I put it in my dsi. From then on sometimes my game would either freaze while I was playing it or would not read my game.And note that I did not even have the action replay!I also had not put the action replay in my dsi.But I think the only good thing are the cheats. Bottem line THE ACTION REPLAY SUCKS!
1,"piece of garbage, not worth the plastic its made of","this is a waste of time, money and plastic. dont even bother it doesnt work. its garbage."
2,Nintendo DS Lite action Replay,"I can't give a good review since I ordered a action replay max,and received a regular action replay."
1,HORRIBLE PRODUCT,"DOES NOT WORK, KEEPS UPDATING, WILL NOT EVER STOP UPDATING. INSTRUCTIONS ARE LAME, SUPPORT IS EVEN WORST. THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD WITH GETTING A PRODUCT TO WORK AT ALL. I WOULD NEVER BUY THIS OR ANY OF THEIR OTHER PRODUCTS IN MY LIFE. PLEASE BEWARE, THEY WILL NOT SUPPORT THIS PRODUCT."
2,Buy it...... to waste your MONEY!,"So, I was having trouble beating a ds game. So i bought this. It helped, but it took FOREVER to scroll throught cheat codes (that also means that there is alot) so, my friends (3 of them) each bought a copy of their own, the firt one who bought it had it for awhile, but it broke on the same day mine did, my second friend, whop bought it later on, put it in his ds and realized that his was broke, my third friend, bought it a month ago and his still works (I doubt for long). So, its up to you, buy it if you need it for like a week, but don't be suprised if it breaks in a week!my suggestion,DONT BUY IT!"
1,give it a negative 5 stars.,"This is a truly garbage, don't buy it. My both computer (one desktop one laptop) can't detect this device when I connected the cable to it.. If I can give negative 5 star on this thing, I will."
1,Game does not do what is says it will,Take our advice ans don't buy this game. My son purchased this and it never worked properly. He was unable to get it to download any new games. He was able to use it once but after that it caused his screen to go blank!We are going to send it back to the manufacturer. Hopefully they will replace it. If they do we will post again.
1,Waste of Money,"I purchased this along with the R4DS system. I never once got any use out of this piece of junk, and no one will buy it back at a used game store place. Most of these cheats can simply be activated in-game via manual typed in code sequences, or, if your running any kind of mod cart, they offer cheat code support. Don't spend your money on this thing, [...] or [...], you'll find codes for your games there for free."
1,Don't Buy This: It'll Ruin your DS!!!,"My son got one of these as a birthday gift, downloaded all the codes, and played once. After that, his games were ruined.I contacted a local store and asked them their experiences of this product and they unequivocally to not buy it, because it will eventually ruin all your saved games and then possibly your DS.Stay away."
1,Do your homework...,"I got this for one reason only, Animal Crossing Wild World. After I put the game in it said unknown game. I tried all i could and still couldn't get it to work. I finally gave up and now just keep it for my friends. If your ever wanting Action Replay. I think you should do your homework before you buy, or you will probebly just be throwing $20 or so dollars away."
1,Disapponted,"I bought this for my daughter 2 times when she still had the DS lite. When she used it, the whole game codes erased it self. She like using it but it was a waste of money! Some codes freezes up her games and the ds lite. I bought her a DSi and it doesn't work on DSi. It only works on DS and DS lite. The first one it got bricked when she updated the Action Replay. The second one was working fine but when I bought her the DSi, it didn't work. It just say ""There is nothing insert in the game card slot"". The first one it shows stripes and on ds lite it says ""There is no game card inserted"". I overall this prouduct 1 star. What a waste of money!"
1,VERY POORLY BUILT!!,I bought this Action Replay for my son. The first one broke within the hour. Luckily I was able to get another one through the seller on Amazon. Shortly after we received the second Action Replay it also broke. It was a waste of money!!!!
4,Pretty Nice,"Its a well featured product. Whats great is that if a new game comes out you just plug it into your computer. Open up the program and it downloads updates for you. FREE. I've enjoyed this quite alot by using codes to gain advantages in my games. However, i find that when you plug it in for updates, it takes a while, in fact, my ARDS (Action Replay DS) is plugged into my computer as we speak, its been in there for more than 30 minutes and isnt finsihed downloading. If your not a patient person your going to have some trouble working with this"
2,"Missing Features, Broken Product","One of the major reasons to have an action replay is to backup your save files and modify them (in programs such as pokesav), sadly, this product is missing this feature, and it's not advertised anywhere on this page.Another problem is this product only works on Windows XP and Vista (luckily I have a computer running XP, you might not be so lucky); No Mac support at all, and I'm not sure about Windows 7. The problem with the windows driver is that it regularly malfunctions. If you plug it into your computer one day, it may not recognize the computer. My AR started overheating when the computer didn't recognize it, but it luckily didn't damage my DS.If you want to use cheat codes, get the AR Media Edition or the DSi version if you're using a DSi, they have better features."
5,Great way to catch 'em all!,Trying to catch every Pokemon is not as easy as it may seem. So this product helped in a big way. Now I have just about all the Legendary Pokemon and some that were really hard to find.
5,It Does Work,"Yes this product works very well, it helped me beat my game in the few days it took me to fly from Spokane Washington where I'm stationed to my deployed location over in the Middle East, where I am at right now. I love this product, and if other people would learn to read to see what they need to do, then they would too. Although I have an unfair advantage, I work on computers for a living for the U.S. Air Force >< so I'm a bit ahead of the game when it comes to being computer savvy. But really, even my mother who knowns NOTHING about computers was able to work this thing for my sisters kids! It's not that hard people, just quite being stupid and read what you have to do to get it to work."
3,It's fine,This helped me with some good codes of how to get good Pokemon. This is an okay item with a good info.
1,Never worked,"I was soo happy when my action replay came in the mail.But as soon as I put the action replay in my ds and cut it on, it never worked. It froze every time."
1,Vercalos,"Overall, I have to say that I'm at least disappointed by this product. Sure, it comes in handy if you want to keep yourself from dying(or at least just give yourself a little more gold), but the thing that sucks about it is that the device will cease to function within a month.I've bought one of these three different times from three different vendors(once directly from Datel's website), and every time, it stopped working within a month or so of use. The DS would no longer detect the cartridge at all.And good luck trying to get customer support from Datel. The codejunkies help forums have been ""temporarily down"" for several years, and the customer support's e-mail bounces. The only time I've ever gotten any sort of response from Datel was when I attempted to make a scathing review on one of their products, elucidating on the issues I've had with it."
2,Gets the job done,"The software does what its suppose to do. I just don't like pluggin it in the ds, then taking it out to put the game in, then putting the Action replay back in again, just to take it back out. But, like i said it does the job. I found that cheating makes the game boring though because there is no challenge."
1,good while it lasted,"Bought it. Arrived fine. Worked fine for about 3 days. Then all the game cheat codes on the unit somehow erased themselves. Link to internet software installed fine, but didn't get a chance to use it. rh"
4,Good,I bought the item for my son. He seems to like it and helps him to find characters in his game that he wasn't as to before.
1,DO NOT BUY!,DO NOT BUY!The drivers for this device do not work with windows 7 so you cannot correctly connect it to your pc. Many people gave workarounds to get the drivers to work and none do.
3,DS Lite Action replay,"My son told me it's a fun game but after a week of using it, it wasn't working anymore. He wasn't happy :("
2,DS Lite Action Replay,"This is my son's 2nd game. It tends to fail, and then you need to buy a new one. He enjoys using it while it works...I would like to see it last longer for him. We were warned by our local game shop that it can be faulty...and does not have longevity."
1,Do NOT buy this Product... it MELTS!!,"I purchased this DS Lite Action Replay so that I could make some slight changes to my Pokemon Platinum DS game. I will say that the disk that came with the set did install correctly, HOWEVER, when I attempted to load the DS to my PC via USB outlet, the DS would NOT connect to the PC. After just a few seconds to a minute of having this plugged into my computer I began to smell something burning. When I picked up my DS it was very hot to the touch. I pulled out the Action Replay instantly only to notice that it was melting! The Action Replay case itself now has a giant melted hole on both sides of the cartridge. Im glad I noticed it before it melted into my DS. Please please DO NOT waste your money on this product! It will not work, and do more harm than good to your DS and your games. If you still want an action replay, buy the newer version."
1,Buyer Beware!,This item worked for maybe 2 weeks then did not do what it was suppose to do. I would not resommend this product.
2,Poor suport product,Got one for my kid.It hard to load in to DS system and down load new codes.Thown away when I have computer under Vista OS.
3,Came quick but it's confusing.,"The item came quickly, which surprised the hell out of me since I didn't even get an email that said 'Your order, number [whatever] has been shipped!'BUT I must be the ONLY person who can't get this! I'm frustrated. I don't know what I did, but all it wants to do now is update. It's on that screen on my DS for ever and nothing happens. I can't figure out how to get the codes to work since I can never get the 'GO!' Icon you're supposed to see. And I can't figure out how to make anything work.I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling several times, but I can't get it to do anything. If anyone has any suggestions, tips or advice, I'll take it. I want to be able to USE the codes/cheats I bought the thing for. x_x"
3,Good device but.......,The product is great while it worked. After 2 weeks it stopped working totally. Tried number of times to call and email datel (the manufacturer) with no luck. No response back from them or even an email acknowledging my call. So what I have to say is buy it and enjoy it till it breaks and then you are on your own.
1,Disappointed with outcome.,"Although the Action Replay seemed like a good idea, we were extremely disappointed with the outcome. It ruined one of my son's games. We decided to never use it again, just in case it would ruin more of our games. I don't think this product is approved by Nintendo."
1,poor quality,"I purchased 2 of these for my children (ages 9 & 10). One did not work at all, the other was disappointing. It did not provide cheats for many of the games the kids were expecting.I think there is another ""Action Replay"" model that if more reliable. Don't bother with this one!"
1,"When it works, it's great","We got this to work once. After that, the PC stopped recognizing the DS. Support from Code Junkies is all but non-existent. So we are basically stuck with an overpriced cable, cartridge, and CD that do not work any longer. If I hear from Code Junkies, I'll be willing to amend my opnion, but for now we're out of luck."
1,Messed Up cheat box,"This little cheating chip seemed good at first, but then it destroyed all my games. I followed the directions perfectly, and it worked fine for a while.It desroyed my Nintendogs and Pokemon Pearl. I am not happy with this at all."
5,very happy (a kid's review),"This is a kid's review.I am very impressed by the ards(action replay ds).It helped me beat pokemon platnum in three days!The people who say they got shipped the wrong drivers are not right,maybe.I might have just gotten lucky.(before I bought it I read the reviews).On pokemon platnum I had 900 master balls.safari balls,dusk balls...etc.I also had 99 tms/hms.I almost thought I got shipped the wrong drivers but I did'nt get shipped the wrong drivers."
3,What if your ds breaks?,"The reason why it says ""Not licensed by Ninetendo""is because it isn't and because It can ruin your games...what I want to emphasis is that if you use this product and something happens to your ds Nintendo will NOT fix or replace your ds."
1,Doesn't work long and no support!,"My son rec'vd this for Christmas and it worked ok for awhile. The problem he had was that the most of the games he has didn't have any codes available. So it only ended up working on 1 maybe 2 of his games. Then one day it just stopped working all together. He turns it on and it goes to a white screen. No warranty or support available at all! ""Just buy another one!"" I have read some of the other reviews here and people say that they are on their 3rd one, 5th one, etc. How can you give more money to this company? They know their product is defective and don't care. Why should they when people just keep handing over money for the same defective peice of junk!"
1,Great the one week that it worked.,This product is not a good buy. It worked for exactly one week before it inexplicably quit working. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!
3,Awesome but crashes games,"This is a great product- except for the fact that it can and will crash your game. It has great codes and they are all great and really help you win the game. Half the games would be really hard to beat without it. But, it crashed my Animal Crossing Wild World game once and New Super Mario Bros too many times to count as well as Mario Kart. It works well, but don't get too dependent on it, as it may and probably will crash when you need it the most (About to defeat the game, main boss, etc etc...) So be warned it is good, and actually works really well until u get too dependent on it when it fails u."
4,"Good, Tricky to Install","First of all, this product works as advertised. You just have to be careful with it in-game. It took me a little while to install it, I figured out that it only worked on the USB ports in the back of my computer, not the front. Be sure to read the manual, as it provides some crucial installation instructions.Overall, the product works and does what it should do."
1,Not the best product Datel ever made,"I purchased this Action Replay a few months ago. I have to say I am very dissatisfied with the product. First off because the advertising doesn't really specify that yes, you need a computer to run the software to update the codes for various DS games. Nor does it say anywhere on the packaging of the product or in the advertisement just what computer specifications are necessary to perform this update. It turned out my computer wasn't able to be used for this.And there is no way to enter codes in manually, to my knowledge. I say to my knowledge, because I was unable to get any replies from the company to my emails asking about this. They never once tried to contact and help me with their product.I recommend not buying this product, especially since the company making it doesn't seem inclined to help their customers."
2,Software a flop,My son loves this - as long as the game are already installed. I can't get the computer update to work for love or money and he is haveing a fit. Then I googled solutions and discovered everyone else has the same problem and there is no fix. What a waste.
3,Gamebusting is the word for it.,"For those who have had problems with this AR Device, it's probably because they were using the codes that came with it. Code Junkies is known for its ""Quantity over Quality"". What I did to help prevent such problems was create my own codes. Since I was using this primarily for Pokemon Pearl version, I downloaded this handy tool called Pokesav. Which allows a person to create codes that are perfect and problem free. Although, when I first used it it kind of for some reason put 95 Explorer kits in my mail bag. So, to fix the problem I created a code to delete those and replace them with 995 Letters.I recommend if someone were to buy this to try to find a good source for codes because when Code Junkies say that this device is ""gamebusting"" it's true."
1,PIECE OF CRAP,Now i know this is a helpful machine for us cheaters/hackers. However this product is a disgrace to all cheating. First of it is not user friendly at all. Also the computer program half the time cant even recognize that you have the ds plugged in..... In my opinion you should either not cheat or buy a different product cause this one will not work for you....
1,junk,"Daughter saved her own money to purchase this. It worked for 3 days. If it were available, I would give it 0 stars."
2,wrong color,The pic of the blue pair was wrong.....I recieved a red and black pair....but other than that it is a great product.
5,A wonderful childhood memory,"As we each go through 13 years of public school education, there are teachers and/or moments that stand out in our minds. My second grade teacher read us the story of Okee the Otter. The author lived in the town next to ours, which made it that much more real. While I do not remember the story fact by fact, I do remember the troubles they had with keeping him in their home..especially in their bathtub."
5,an intriging tale,this book was a sensational biography of a pet otter and it brought you through his whole life flawlessly. I first read this bbok when i was 12 and i have loved for 3 whole years and i think you'll love it to!!
5,Much help for Christians who are suffering,"The Matthews family were among the last missionaries out of China as the country went down to the Communists. This is the story of the two years they spent near the Mongolian border, tested in every way. Their faith grew strong in the Refiner's fire, as they found the Living God able to meet every need. This book will give you principles and practical help for the suffering you are undergoing as a believer in Jesus Christ."
4,Helps us remember...,"This is a short book with a beautiful message. It details the life of the Mathews family in northwest China at the time of the founding of the ""New China."" It tells the story of the Mathews' hopes & dreams, their disappointments, trials, & betrayals, & lastly their deliverance from the control of the communist government. We need books such as this to help us remember what sacrifice & commitment look like. It was not that long ago."
1,Chairs Manufactured by this Company are Defective,"I purchased six of these chairs in August for myself and my friends before the start of the college football season for tailgaiting. They were all made by this manufacturer (North Pole) and had different NFL logos on them (I only bought one through Amazon, the others were bought through different companies due to availability issues).At the first game of the season, my chair (Steelers) broke. At the second game of the season, two more chairs (Bengals and Broncos) broke. They were not misused and no weight limits were exceeded. They all broke in the same exact place; the plastic pieces at the base of the legs all cracked. Therefore, 3 out of 6 broke within probably less than 3-5 hours.Needless to say, at $25-$30 each I would recommend prospective buyers to spend their money elsewhere."
3,Easy pictorial book for young adults who like science,"A pictorial book for young adults and adults who prefer light reading, this book examines the hows and whys of some of the worst winter weather, historical storms of the past, plus has nicely illustrated diagrams showing how winter storms form, lake effect snows cause heavy snowfall downwind, and how ice storms form."
3,save your money,"This book is not worth the amount being asked for it. It is practically useless for anyone with a decent background in Spanish. You may pick up a few phrases you weren't aware of but the format is not conducive to really helping you improve your business Spanish. If you have no background in Spanish at all, I still don't reccommend it, you won't be able to do anything but try and memorize phrases and will probably do it poorly. You'd be better of either going with a cheap phrase book in that case, or really learning the language with a good grammar book if you are the self-study type, or taking a class."
4,A bag with class,"I'm an electrician that is currently working on a long term large scale commercial/industrial job and this bag fits the situation nicely. I loved the line of small yet deep pockets, I can line up various drivers I think I may need for a particular mini project. I also like the large pockets opposite, they are good place to keep an ugly's book, angle finder, calculator anything thin really. And the larger outer pocket is perfect to keep a med sized notepad and/or hand drawn copys of the prints. The bottom is made of somewhat thin leather, not sure if it will hold up like the vinyl, but at least it wont crack up in the cold...I wish it came with a strap, but if you can imaging you can make/find a strap for it. If this thing had a good thick leather bottom it would be perfect."
2,The import is the only real way to watch NARUTO,this edited version is just crap. i've seen a few episodes of the import version but i don't know how to get any of it. Does anyone know where to buy the import dvds for this series?
1,Wait for a rerelease.,Naruto is a great series don't get me wrong. However this DVD from Shonen Jump only has the English dub audio track on it and the anime is pretty subpar with the American voice actors. Not as bad as One Piece but still not good either. I was really excited that they finally put Naruto out ond DVD. I was angry however when I learned there is no Japanese track. I don't think I can trust any DVD with the words Shonen Jump on them again if this is how they release a product. However it's still a decent series if you still want to check it out on Cartoon Network but the Japanese voices have alot more emotion than their American counterparts.
2,Watered Down Anime,"Okay this is one of my favorite animes. But if i were you i would wait for the uncut version or better yet buy the japanese version w/english subs. Its not that the show is actually horrible on the CW but the CW's version is watered down...if your like me then you hate it when things get cut out, thats what they do.Its been turned into a kids anime which really isn't what it is if you watch the origional version. The voice acting is good i will have to say that but the japanese voices are great to and the soundtrack in the japanese version is amazing...although some of the music is the same in the english version some of my favorite songs are the ones at the begining and end of the episodes and those are not in the english version.Like I said before wait for the uncut version (I hope they put it out in a box set when the whole series is done) or get the origional Japanese version if you don't mind reading subtitles it really is worth it."
4,It's not that bad...,"Okay, maybe some of you people think that this DVD is horrible, but it's really not that bad. I mean, they could have done worse! They could have changed the characters' names to like, instead of ""Naruto"" it could have been ""Jack"" or something. I think the voice actors do a good job! They edited it to be a kid-friendly show because Cartoon Network is a kids' TV station. Sure, the more mature shows come on at night (like on Saturday night with Dragon Ball Z, Naruto...), and the kiddy shows come on earlier (like Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends, Camp Lazlo, Billy and Mandy...). If you want to see even more mature TV shows on that channel, watch Adult Swim, that comes on even later at night! If you aren't happy with the Cartoon Network/Toonami edited version of Naruto, buy the uncut version on DVD! I know everyone has their opinions, but those reviews were a little harsh to me."
3,Lighten up folks....,"Really, I think the CN version deserves more credit than it's getting. Really, the edits aren't that bad! atleast their keeping the plots and the true feel of the series. Instead of apprecianting waht you currently have, all people do is b***h.Really, the dubbers atleast added some class to it. Yeah the voices could use work but really it's not that bad! Now, would you rather have 4kids dub it renaming the series Jason's kickboxing adventure (4kids was supposed to get naruto) or would you rather have decent dubbing that keeps most of thge words with few edits and no name changes. You say CN version? yeah thought so....Really, give CN a bit more credit than this. Besides uncut DVDs are coming out soon.Get over it."
1,"Wait for the Uncut,Don""t buy dis S**t!!!!","Well yeah I watch the Dub,i know the voices and dialonge suck,but i only pay attention to the action.The jap version is better than the the dub,the dub has a dead soul!!i watch the Dragonball and Dragonball Z,through many of the episode prieviews has the narrator acting retarded but DB/Z is waaay better than the dub,plus i db/z better than even the jap version!I never seen a jap episode becuz my computer is screwed...but i seen the clips which prove the sub is better!When i intrested in Naruto in Shonen Jump,the october 2004 issue which came out in September and i thought Naruto was about kids playing board games(I didnt pay attention to the manga that mich back then).Then i found it had action and waited for the dub.And the dub""s voices sucked!Wait and buy The Uncut on July 4th.thats when the uncut comes out."
1,SUCH A HUGE LET DOWN!!!,"I am a huge fan of Naruto and yet I can't bring myself to watch even one full episode of it since they brought it over to the cartoon network. All I can ask myself is ""Where did they find the voice actors?!?"" Maybe it's the fact that I've seen the original version several times, but the english dubbed version is truly horrible!! The English voices come off like their just reading from the script and just do not go with the charecters!! To be honest, you'll be much much better off buying the Fansub DVD's off Ebay (Amazon will probably not put this up now) and you'll get the three movies along with 150+ episodes at a much cheaper price. I know some of you will resent having to read sub-titles; but beleive me, it's worth it."
5,A joy to watch,"The anime doesnt really pick off til chapter 30 when the chunnin exams begin, thats when you get to know more about the different characters instead of focusing on just naruto and his group, their unique fighting styles and ninja jutsus are a joy to watch. The depth in the development in the characters and styles are beyond genius, (even naruto himself) is done far more creative and thoughtful then any anime I ever seen, it makes the characters in Dragonballz or Inuyasha fall dull in comparison. The only thing I don't like about this anime is they seem to drag some of the episodes alot with flashbacks on the characters pass, sometimes a new episode can show a full 10 minutes of a pass episode, other then that this is no doubt the most fun to watch anime for me."
3,Think about it,"First off the show is excellent, but you have to by it in Japanese because Viz totally messed the show up. The characters sound awful. I started the show by watching it on Cartoon Network, then I bought the Japanese version, its so much better. Trust me, viz makes the characters sound funny."
4,Great show,Naruto is a great show but the dubbing could use a little work. I'd list this up there with my favorite anime shows1) Full Metal Alchemist 2) Ruroni Kenshin 3) Naruto 4) InuyashaIf you'd like to watch the series its on cartoon network during the Toonami block every SaterdayAlso there will be a 8 hour marathon of NAruto on December 31stIm watching BELIEVE IT!
3,pretty but not as pictured,"This tree is very pretty, but not at all like it's pictured. It's silver in color (the pictures made it look like it was a green tree, and the description made it sound like there would be silver tinsel on the branches. Instead it is completely silver tinsel) It's only about 1 1/2 feet thick at the bottom (pictures makes it look much fuller).The tree comes in three parts, and there are no assembly instructions. Part C is the bottom, followed by B in the middle, and A on the top. One string of lights was also not working. I even removed that string (not an easy task), and there were no bulbs broken, and the fuses were not blown.Had I seen this tree in the store, I would not have thought it worth the price."
2,Poorly organized,"If you are looking for general information about hummingbirds, not bad at all.Trying to use this book to identify the birds is almost impossible. I bought the book because I live in Mexico and there are lots of hummers here.Evidently the person(s) who set this book up either had never, ever SEEN a decent field guide (yes, I know this is not a field guide) or thought that nobody would buy the book who couldn't already identify each species."
1,Won't fit standard credit cards,"Japanese must have smaller credit cards, or something. None of my bank nor credit cards will fit in this thing. This is partly the fault of the ring of studs, causing the slots to not be wide enough, but even without them, the pockets would only keep a card about half-deep. Makes the wallet worthless... Unless maybe you want to sew it onto something as a patch... Even then the decal is so faint that it wouldn't make for much of a piece of décore."
2,Hellsing Wallet Review,"The wallet itself is very cool, however it's use is somewhat limited. It had a few missing elements that annoyed me, but which is not really the sellers fault though.First of, the space where you put your coins don't have a zipper. So if you open your wallet the wrong way, all the coins will fall out.I also only has 4 slots for credit cards or whatever, which are very tight. Personally that makes it hard for me, as I normally seperate my receipts, bills, credits cards and other cards.The good thing is that it's thin and easy to carry around. But of course, the best part is the design. You should obviously only buy this if you're a Hellsing fan (though the cross may confuse some).Overall very cool item, but not that good for regular use."
2,Very basic info,This book is very short and the information is very general. Only a few things pertained specifically to commercials at all. There are much more detailed and informative books out there.
5,Stuart is a wiz when it comes to casting!,"This is a must read for anyone trying to break in. Stuart has had years of experience and it shows. With starting out as an actor and now in charge of casting, he knows the ins and outs. Definitely recommend!"
5,The Best Acting Book Ever,"I read Stuart's book and became so motivated to get out and start making things happen for myself with reagards to my acting career. He give excellant advice on what to do and how to do it. Anyone reading this book, will not want to put it down. It truly is the best book ever!"
3,A Shadow of an Important Novel,"Does the name of Ted Danson ring any bell? It doesn't? No wonder, Ted was the ""star"" of some early 80s soap opera who wanted to become a real actor. Unfortunately, his choice for the path to stardom was the movie made of William Wharton's ""Dad"". The story had to be refashioned to be more glitzy - a painter became an actor. The result is rather grim and, if you haven't read the novel, difficult to follow. The story is sad - the book is saturated with nostalgia for what the heroes missed in life or realized too late to enjoy fully - the film is so so.And there is one moderately funny bit - Jack Lemmon and Olympia Dukakis through the film look as if they both wanted to ask one and the same question - What am I doing in this movie??? They are doing their best but it is not enough to save and Ethan Hawke is too young to make a difference."
2,rediscovering my folks,"this is a film that teachs you about not only being a father but how to become a son, about being truthful to your roots and your future"
5,Great older movie,This was a great movie. The cast is great. I liked how the characters were all developed as to how the dad's condition affected all of them in different ways. A nust see for all.
3,Different zone of DVD players,"The dvd was in great condition, the problem is that it doesn't work in europe, because it is an US product, and the DVD players are different in USA."
4,Fantastic,This moview brought tear to my eyes.. I was introduced to this movie by my mother and I could not find it in the stores or in movie rental stores. ^5 to amazon I can always count on finding quality merchandise no matter what I am looking for.
2,"Some decent performaces, but overall a rather mediocre effort","Ted Danson is pretty good as a business exec who becomes very attached to his father, played by Jack Lemmon. Lemmon himself is also not bad as the aging father, but the movie itself is full of contrived scenes that are supposed to be heartwarming, but come across as predictable and sometimes ludicrous. Also, I was rather displeased with Lemmon's makeup, which doesn't seem very realistic (I can't believe it was nominated for an Oscar!)."
4,Great Shoe.................Elastic on ankle Strap Isn't Stretchable,"These are great shoes and makes the feet look really sexy. I always buy aersoles and haven't had any problems. The only problem with my shoes are the ankle strap really doesn't go around the the higher smaller part of the ankle like most ankle strap shoes, they cut across across the top part and if you twist your feet too much it unsnaps. Since I purchased the shoe on sale and I want to keep them. I am going to have some additional leather added to the ankle strap for comfort. Actually I bought 2 pair. : )I purchased the black leather and leopard print."
1,Paper Jam,"I bought this scanner last month (Nov 2006). When you do scanning through ADF, paper often get jam. I called the customer service for help and their recommendation was return this to the vender from whom i have purched."
1,Replacement set just as bad,I bought this 71-939 set and the bits did not last at all. I contacted BD customer support and they sent me a new set for free and when I asked them if they wanted the bad parts to give to their metalugist they said no and now that I have a new set they are as bad. Example. Number 2 bit phillips head last for 3-7 screws. I no longer trust black and decker unless bought locally where I can return easily. Also they just give you new without solving problems
5,Sociologically Mindfulness,"I purchased this book for an introductory Sociology class and this book helped me a lot with the class. This book is very well written with the intent of making sociology easier to understand. Michael Schwalbe avoids the idea of sounding too scientific noting that if readers are looking for terms and definitions regarding the subject of Sociology then The Sociologically Examined Life: Pieces of the Conversation is not the book for that. The book is broken down in different chapters and within the chapters are Sub-headings that go in depth with different examples Schwalbe uses to demonstrate sociological mindfulness. Each chapter contains, great examples, valid but debatable points and will make anyone rethink the social world."
1,Socialism thinly veiled as Sociology,"This book is simply terrible: it is subjective in the extreme; it is highly biased and in many cases it is in conflict with fact. The author preaches personal social policy preferences as academic discipline and submits wildly speculative opinion as science.If you're interested in real Sociology, check out something by Joseph Berger. If you want a great general review of the sociological / anthropological / demographical / geographical / historical forces that have shaped the way our world is today then take a look at ""Diversity amid Globalization"" by Martin Lewis, et al."
2,Disappointing and clearly biased,"Schwalbe's concept of ""Sociological Mindfulness"" - or basically, how to be a good and socially responsible person - is heavily filtered through his liberal ideaological views. He tells us in the book's very first chapter that calling him a liberal is meaningless, because labels in themselves are meaningless. Sure, throwing around labels like ""Liberal"" or ""Conservative"" is not only weak, but cliche. However, when you're writing a book that is essentially a guide to living in and improving society, you definitely lose some credibility for being clearly biased politically.I don't identify myself at all as a conservative, as I'm pretty liberal myself (possibly even more liberal than Schwalbe that condemns anyone producing or supporting pornography as being responsible ultimately for only misery, and lumps that specific industry in with big tobacco and gun manufacturers), but that doesn't mean I support someone shoveling a political agenda and calling it social science."
5,One of those oldies but goodies,"Letters to Philip is the collection of letters written by a father to his son before his marriage. While some may say this is outdated advice, I would disagree. I'm sure most future wives who read this would agree that they would want their husbands to learn from it. Certainly there seems to be some material you may feel is old fashioned, and I'd agree (i.e. the idea that women do the cooking, men show up for dinner, the traditional models of marriage, etc.). Still, Shedd gives you some food for thought, and having read it through more than three times over the years, has good advice to keep coming back to. I recommend the young man to read this and his future bride to read Letters to Karen."
4,An outstanding look in to what women want,"I truly enjoyed reading this book because it gave me a real nice insight into what I should do to have a long and lasting relationship. The book was very straight forward and gave lots of useful information that I can use later in life when I get married, or even now when I am starting out in serious relationships. Over all I thought that this book was great and I would recommend it to all who want to have a long and lasting relationship."
4,For a good chuckle ...,"This book is amazingly outdated. I sent it to a friend of mine (a woman) as a joke. It gets four stars because it's amazingly funny (in a stupid sort of way). See also, Letters to Karen. The stories bring tears to my eyes! These books give The Onion's Our Dumb Century a run for funniest things I've ever read. Too bad they're serious. Is a woman's place still really in the home? Amazing!"
4,How Men Should Love Women,"After reading this review I was suprised. With it being such an old book I thought it would be out dated, but it wasn't. I agreed with many of the ideas, and felt they should be practiced. With all of his points I feel he described they very well. I even feel that some of his points could help me in my relationship. This book told how to build a strong base for your relationship, and maintain it throughout marriage."
4,it is very helpful,"i think this is very good book. i really enjoyed this book. this book gives you many advice. some of sentences that i cannot understand but it was really helpful for me. speceily i like the fifth letter ""our seven goal for communication. it gives me many things that i have to change for myself. but as i said before, i have to read again if i want to understand fully. anyway it is good to read for everyone."
5,Possibly the most important marriage manual...,"...since the Bible.Charlie Shedd, in his plainspoken way, helps his son Philip lay down the foundations of a great and lasting marriage. With wit and gentleness, Charlie touches on all the elements of a wonderful union from the man's perspective."
5,Letters to Philip,"This book has wonderful advice on how to be considerate of the differences husbands and wives bring to marriage. By reading and trying to care for the needs of your spouse, the marriage will be blessed even more."

4,Great bagpipe based Christmas album,We've had this CD for almost 2 decades and still love it. Its one we look forward to every year!
5,Fabulous...,"We got this pack when my husband had surgery over 2 years ago. It has seen our family of four - including two kids in sports - through knee injuries, sprained ankles and other miscellaneous injuries since. This gel pack has reamained intact and ""liquid"" when cold. It is looking pretty ratty (having just seen me through 2 weeks of icing yet another injury 3 times a day) and I have decided to purchase another one. I am very happy to see that it is still available."
1,"Froze too solid, never softened","I wanted a gel pack that stayed cold. This one stayed frozen solid but never softened enough to apply to sore back or knee. I tried thawing it, refreezing and using but it remained frozen solid. Disappointed - either this product is poorly designed or I got a bum unit."
3,"Not Bad, but not the best","This novel is set during the turbulent student uprisings. Kate is charged with saving the University College, sort of like NYU's New School, primarily for adults returning to finish their education. The powers that be do not want the school to continue, the reasons are not clear. The leader of the movement is Professor Cudlipp, a stereotypical academic snob, he appears in all of these novels in one form or another. Predictably, he is murdered and Kate and Reed are bound to find out the truth.I usually enjoy these academic mysteries, but this one is just too dated for my taste. The radicals of this time were the repressed conservative professors of my time, and this mystery doesn't age as well as her others. The writing and mystery are still fine, but the setting is old fashioned, but not enough to be historical or quaint yet."
5,Iliad on CD - very good,"very good rendition. pace of reading is good and passionate without being melodramatic. very entertaining for long commutes or car trips. however, if you haven't read the book or are not somewhat familiar with the story already, it can be difficult at times to keep all the characters straight. however, there is a brief synoptic insert that comes with the CD and will help to read quickly before listening."
5,One of the great works of western literature...,"Many mark ""The Iliad"" as the first major work of western literature. Others will give works such as ""The Epic of Gilgamesh"" that honour, nonetheless ""The Iliad"" is truly a great poem. In fact, both ""The Iliad"", and ""The Odyssey"" were tremendously influential (some even liken their prominence to that of the Bible) to the ancient Greek society that would provide much of the framework for the modern western world. Few other works can make such claims. ""The Iliad"" is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the origins of western thought.One word of advice, however, is that if you are unfamiliar with the epic style, you may wish to begin with ""The Odyssey"", despite the fact that, at least in plot, it is the successor to ""The Iliad"". ""The Odyssey"" is a far easier read, and found by many to be more exciting than ""The Iliad"" (which can, at times, be somewhat tedious). If you are left thirsting for more, tackle ""The Iliad""."
4,"Great player, pay attention to the compatibility","This player is great, once you get it working.I have Windows 7 on all 3 of my computers at home, and had to basically rebuild an old laptop with XP and Windows Media Player version 10 to get this device to be seen and/or recognized to add music to it.No drivers that I could find would work with Windows 7 from either the Support at Dell, or any other searches that I did.However, once I did get it working, it's awesome. Great sound, portability, ease of use, and cosmetically.The size is perfect (storage size) since I use this primarily when I'm working on my property.If Windows XP and WMP ver10 is good for you - this thing is great."
1,Garbage,"The 12mm wrench in particular is junk. I can't speak for the other sizes in the set though. The tolerance is terible, there is a lot of play. When I tried my crow's foot from Northern Tool and it had no play whatsoever. When holding the crow's foot against this wrench, there was an obvious difference as the wrench pitched out several degrees and was very obvious.I'm very lucky I didn't do any damage with this thing. I'd return it, but I had bought it too long ago (I had anticipated a particular repair, just hadn't gotten to it until now) and Amazon won't let me return it now."
5,The Scottish Patriot who fought for self-determination,"Ladybird history books are social history at it's best, from; I would estimate ages 8 to 14 for school use of simply to enjoy. They bring history alive for children, and are filled with fascinating information. As well as bringing alive an animated, exciting past, they also show how events of the past, are with us today, in so many fascinating ways.This review is dedicated to self-determination of nations and the nation-state!Robert the Bruce, published in 1964, is written by L Du Garde Peach and beautifully illustrated by Andrew Kenney. It tells the story of the great the great Scottish hero and patriot, who won independence for Scotland, from that country's English oppressors. The illustrations by Kenney really make the narrative come alive, about the real story of this folk hero."
3,Not as strong as the original,I used the original product in the 70s and 80s when it was available. It was a dark rich brown color and the perfume was the very finest. This product is much weaker and lighter but still pleasant but nothing like it used to be. I am still undecided about this scent in the current formula.
5,Brilliance!,"Never have I had a CD (let alone a 2 CD set) hit me with so much musical and lyrical truth. Definitely catch this band live, when they're in your apple orchard, for an extraordinary experience! This is definitely one CD that I'm absolutely proud to say that I've purchased...rather than downloaded! This is what music is all about..."
2,"uh? i mean heck no, he-e-e-eck no!","i know everyone is gonna hate me for this, but i gotta be honest here; for those who still have not heard this album then please don't bother. I think this is probably the worst double album ever made. afterall what is the point of a double album if not to showcase your uniqueness, your originality and creativity. double albums were not made to have two discs with exactly the same songs, which, unfourtunately, Over the Rhine has done and practically ruined the double album as it should be. i really think this is one of the worst albums i own. both discs are like one long song that drags on. it is so repetitive it's hard to believe that they actually consider each song new. THis is really, really lacking in gripping moments, is very full of boredom, and i'm sorry, didn't touch me in the least. i cannot even believe how much everyone likes this album as much as they do. as each song starts you're thinking, oh man, this song again. really dissappointing."
3,Great Songs - But Needs a Change of Scenery,"The cover art is indicative of the music in the album, dark and bleak but with the hope of light. I am going to go see the band live, as I found their music and individual songs to be quite enjoyable. But as an album - skip the rest of the reviews and read the one by Danny Salinger. I agree with his review, although he may be a little rough in his evaluation of a double album. As an album, there is not enough variety, pacing, or it seems, thought to the arrangement of the individual songs. I guess that is what a producer should do - tell the artist, look you need to have some ups and downs, some rhythm, some thought to the placement of individual songs. I enjoyed listening to many of the individual songs, but halfway through the album, you start wondering when you will get a change of scenery. Maybe that is the point, this album is like a drive through Central Ohio, or more like Iowa or Nebraska."
5,An excellent find,"I had heard one song and decided to try an Over the Rhine album. Great decision as the album is fantastic. There is not a bad song on the double album, and it makes me amazed that they have not been a blockbuster group. Her voice is simply addicting, as I think this is the first time I have thought of someone's voice as haunting (good thing). Highly recommend buying."
3,Hills Like White Elephants Triumphs,"The second of these three films in this anthology is a clever adaptation of Hemingway's famous short story. The screenwriters (Didion and Dunne)turn Hemingway's own short story against him. Their ploy is to present the film as an accurate representation of a brief moment in time and to intimate that Hemingway's short story is, to some extent, an unfaithful--or, at least, incomplete--account of the actual event. It does this marvelous inversion by hinting that the male lead is Hemingway and then having the Melanie Griffith character say, in effect, that ""you are going to make a story about this, aren't you, and you're going to change everything around."" Touche! Literature, in this act of gamesmanship, becomes an inaccurate representation of ""reality"" (i.e., the film itself) and Hemingway is the victim of this comic-satiric thrust.The other two short films are fine, but ""Hills"" prevails as a cinematic coup."
5,Titles,"Performed by David Graham, Kenny Cole, Lee Grant, Patty Lewis, Keith Newell1. Butterfly kisses2. I will always love you3. You are so beautiful4. Because you loved me5. One in a million6.

3,Decent read.......,"Bought this book several months ago and started reading it and for some reason laid it aside, now looking for something to read I picked it up, and started reading it again. I started to get into this book and starting to enjoy it though several things bothered me, for one the Church,I though that Vampires were afaid of the church, and the religious ideas. Also, wondering about the Feral Vampires and why the other Vampires died when their sires were killed. But these opinions were minor compared to the idea and the whole story altogther. Have to say though that I thoroughlly enjoyed this book and was so sorry that Bernadette and Father John were taken away from each other,also was sorry about Father John being in the state that he was in. Would like to see a sequel to this book. Read this book, I highly recommend it regardless of my opinions."
3,Every page brings new horror,An evil time causes people and vampires to do evil things. A lot of bad things happen to good people.
1,Inept bloodporn for the vampire addict who is beyond discrimination.,"Without question the worst book of any genre I've read this year. I am offended at the RMN reviewer who compared this to early Stephen King...crack must be cheap in the mile high state.On the other hand, if you don't need to be bothered by anything like plot development or storyline and just want 400 pages of mannequin-like characters wandering through a vague backdrop of bloodspattered gorefest, this book is exactly to your taste. For me, my only pleasure derived from this book was scoring two points off the rim into the waste receptacle."
1,His worst effort in years,"I usually like Wilson's books, but this one is truly terrible. It is juvenile, predictable, and unoriginal. It reads like something Wilson might have written in his teens, it just isn't good. If you MUST read it, get it at the local library, don't waste $25 on it."
2,Not my cup of horror,"I'm a big ole fan of Wilson's Repairman Jack novels, but vampires stories turn me off. I think that sub-genre has been way over done. I gave this one a try anyway, but this one's just not my cup of horror. I can see it appealing to those readers that can't get enuf vampires, but I'm gonna read Wilson's other work."
3,"OK, but not one of Wilson's best","I am a fan of Wilson's ""Repairman Jack"" and his Adversary cycle books so, although I think that the current avalanche of vampire books, TV series, and films is composed of dopey, formulaic schlock, I thought I'd try Wilson to see if his take on this genre was any better.Well, unfortunately, I'd say that this book was just so-so. It was a quick read and somewhat entertaining, but not up to his usual standard.What I did find interesting was the Jewish theological plot element, in which almost all of the Jews, refusing to wear crosses--which were actually effective against vampires--were killed off due to their stubbornness i.e. if crosses were effective that meant the Jesus was, indeed, the Messiah, that the Jews had missed him, and that their theology was wrong, and, rather than admit that, and that Christian theology was right, they perished."
5,Fantastic!,Wonderfully talented author! A completely fresh take on the genre. Wilson has taken back the vampire mythos from the Emo-Vampire market.Long live F. Paul Wilson!
3,Interesting enough but doesn't really grab me,"The story is interesting and has kind of a new, interesting premise of how vampires take over. But it's just OK. I like it but I'm also having a hard time finishing because it's just not grabbing for some reason."
4,old style vampire lore,"Before Guillermo Del Toro came out with his Strain Trilogy, there was a small, often missed novel by F Paul Wilson that harkenned back to the vampires of yester year. Bloodthirsty heartless creatures of the night whose only desire was to continue their lives by ending yours.This is a vampire novel before the coming of the teenage teeny bopper; lets fall in love with the three hundred year old vampire hanging out at the local high school degeneration of the genre as a whole.This is a vampire novel as it should be. Bloody. Dark. Hopeless.This is to the vampire novel what Walking Dead is to Zombies.It is that good.Midnight Mass does not disappoint."
4,Vampires Take over the World,"F. Paul Wilson's apocalyptic vampire novel ""Midnight Mass"", is an expansion of his short story of the same name. The novel carries the story of vampires dominating the east coast of the United States after taking over all of Europe. The Vampires, in league with their human collaborators, round up and use the remaining humans as food. When a few people find the courage to fight the vampiric invasion they first must wrestle with questions of morality and faith before they can begin to combat the supernatural enemy. Generally entertaining, this book offers a fun journey into a world falling apart as dark forces reign supreme. Read the book but at all costs avoid the low-budget film based on the short story."
3,"A Cross between the ""V"" Miniseries and Dawn of the Dead","The Book starts out gangbusters but then lulls the reader to sleep in the later chapters. The story would have been better if kept larger in scope, not just focusing on a small group of survivors in New York. Clever updating of some of the vampire mythos but too many talking heads and not enough action in the middle of the story."
3,Traditional yet diffrent.,This book contained a lot of traditional vampire ideas. Who was doing the hunting was diffrent. The author could have put more details about the vampires in hear and kinda of leaves you hanging at the end. This book was still a good read but was a little difficult to get into.
4,They're baaaacckk!,"I just finished reading the book today and almost felt a sadness at its end - the problem was, I didn't want it to finish!The book is a bit rocky, prose-wise, but that doesn't stop it from being an compelling read that offers engaging characters and a great fight against the undead.As Wilson makes clear in his all-too-brief author's note, he's bringing back the evil, cross-fearing vampires of old - represented too far and few between by standouts like the ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" flicks - and crapping all over Rice's ""Byronic aesthetes"" (as depicted in ""Interview With the Vampire"", et. al.)It was quite a joy to read this book for that reason alone.Bring back the *real* vampires and a sequal to this great book!"
2,Misses the mark,"Mark Barrowcliffe has created the perfect anti-hero: a cheating man who faces the ultimate dilemma: two women -- his fiancee and his mistress -- are pregnant at the same time. What will Stewart do? Infidelity for First-Time Fathers is a dark and ironic novel about a man's struggle to do the right thing. However, this novel has missed the mark. The theme isn't the problem -- though I am sure that readers, especially the female ones, might find the plot somewhat problematic -- the problem is that the male protagonist seeks sympathy in the appalling situation. I was expecting a dark, tell-like-it-is tale of an unfaithful man. Instead, I found the aforementioned character childish and whiny. However, all is not lost in the story. Cat Grey, for example, is an original and fresh character. She isn't the ... typical ""other woman,"" which I find refreshing. Other than that, the novel fails to deliver the dark situations that I had expected. A true disappointment..."

The theme isn't the problem -- though I am sure that readers, especially the female ones, might find the plot somewhat problematic -- the problem is that the male protagonist seeks sympathy in the appalling situation. I was expecting a dark, tell-like-it-is tale of an unfaithful man. Instead, I found the aforementioned character childish and whiny. However, all is not lost in the story. Cat Grey, for example, is an original and fresh character. She isn't the stereotypical ""other woman,"" which I find refreshing. Other than that, the novel fails to deliver the dark situations that I had expected. A true disappointment..."
1,"Won't hold charge after first month, NOT covered by warranty","I bought this from an online automotive products store because it was advertised as a ""swirl-finding"" spotlight for my car's paint. That was a total crock, making it just another flashlight.Furthermore, after the first month, it won't even hold a charge. I have followed the instructions to always charge it for 8 hours. It will be bright when I take it off the charger, but it will be next to dead 24 hours later. To my dismay, the ""1 year limited warranty"" does not cover the battery at all (or the light bulbs), meaning this light basically comes with no warranty at all.I would not recommend this to anyone."
4,Great Product,This product has worked well for my husband. It was the best price and lights up the front yard when needed.
4,Works very well in photography,"These were recommended to me by a photographer I know, and I'm very pleased with the purchase. I was disappointed (thus the 4) to see the inner construction, as there is an unsecured piece of glass that can very easily fall out and break when replacing the bulb. None the less, easy to work with, can be filtered in many ways, and provide excellent light with just a pair of them."
3,Marine spotlight,"The light is well made, but the beam spreads out too much to be used as a spotlight. The other thing that I wonder about is how it can be called a marine light when the instructions say not to get it wet."
1,Brinkmann dual xenon rechargable light,"The problem with rating products is that we tend to do it on a short term basis. Does it work? This light did work, for 13 months. It is guaranteed for a year so it is out of warranty. The rechargable battery does not hold a charge. It probably lasted 12.5 months actually I am just getting around to the review. I am a rechargable light guy. This is the worst one I've had. Don't buy it and try to find one with a two year guarantee. I don't think it needs to last forever, that's not the point, one month out of warranty is not acceptable. But then Brinkmann knows they are garbage that's why they don't guarantee them longer. The ones I've bought before lasted a couple of years minimum."
4,Awesome product and awesome price:-),"It came in a pretty package that is very hard to open but after 10 minutes of struggling, I finally opened it up and behold, it was ready to go; No need to charge:-).....it's really bright an I can't wait for my new Canon 5D to arrive so I can test it on one of my models:-)"
4,"This is good, but it is not a spotlight!","This light's beam is more flood than spotlight and does not do well for ""painting with light"". When painting with light you want a beam that pops onto your subject, not one the fill the subject with light. This light will be given to my son and I'll be looking for a spotlight. One that has no more than a 1-2 ft spotlight from 20 feet away."
3,A marine unit that is for use in a 'dry location only?',"It works ok and seems be be well-built, but what is this 'dry location use only'? It's a marine unit for goodness sakes! It's even white and blue instead of silver. Since I bought it for wet use, I returned it."
2,Doesn't hold a charge very long,Doesn't hold a charge very long. Low beam is useless. And high beam isn't much better. Would not buy this one again.
3,I don't know what all of the fuss is about -this seems like a relatively normal flashlight to me,"This duo beamed flashlight, while heavy duty and bright enough, does not rise up to the hype I have read about it. The brightness of the light is nothing to brag about, and barely reaches through the shadows of my back yard. The fact that it is rechargeable and that the change lasts for at least an hour helps to minimize my disappointment, but there are many other torches out there which are 1/3 the size of this beast which can meet or beat this one in terms of brightness. One interesting point about this torch is that the light comes from two LEDs, which is pretty impressive. Still, what I need is a spotlight bright enough for me to determine whether a coyote or bobcat is on our property....this one just barely does this for me."
2,spotlight,So i bought this for my son for christmas so he could walk the dogs at nighta couple weeks later the second bulb burns out and he gets mad at me.if it didnt break down this spotlight would be great.its really bright.
2,A book for those who think Robert Jarrow is a lightweight!,"Robert Jarrow praises this book! I think that tells you the level of this text. It's Ivy League Ph.D.-school material with inadequate background provided. I guess if you are already a director of research in an investment bank, this book provides a lucid and compact survey of the current state-of-the-art techniques of credit risk modeling. In short, this is a book written for people who already are comfortable with the subject at a very high level.If you are a regular Schmoe like myself (someone comfortable at the Hull or Cuthbertson and Nitzche level) much of this book may zoom over your head. But if you regulary snicker at folks like me as derivatives dilatants and poseurs, I'd say check it out.The book may be great. But for me it was a waste of money.Did I mention that Robert Jarrow likes it?"
3,This book is too quick for an introduction,"I took a master level credit risk class with two assigned textbooks: this one and Quantitative Risk Management by McNeil et al. I love the second book more because it explains the fundamentals in a fabulous way; most of our lectures followed materials in McNeil's. As someone explained in another entry, Lando's book is like a survey book, which is very compact for a beginner."
1,Waste of Money,"This is one of the worst books I have read in applied probability. Key results are glossed over, sometimes stated incorrectly, and almost always incomplete. I will give two examples: (1) In page 33, line 2 the author quotes a formula and places a footnote saying that it does not agree with the result of the original paper. The result in Lando misses a term exp(-\gamma T) and is therefore incorrect, but Lando can't be bothered about who is right, he or the original authors. (2) In page 114, a formula (5.3) and the one preceding it are quoted as ""essential ingredient""s in obtaining many pricing formulae but not proved. I wasted considerable amount purchasing the book and cannot recommend it based on its quality or level of content. To call it a book for a course is a cruel joke."
4,"absolute classic, though kind of dated","Carver Mead was one of the of the pioneers of the idea of a ""silicon neuron"" back in the 1980's. The interesting part is that he sees the direct analog between synthetic neurons and conductance-based models. Instead of membrane capacitance being charged by ions in the neurons, VLSI capacitors are charged by electrons, and so forth.By now, the book is somewhat dated - a lot of advances have happened since it was published - but it's still a classic, and highly recommended for anyone interested in the possibility of using analog computing for modeling neurons and networks."
5,Excellent Commentaries,"Hiaasen always rates five stars. This is a compliation of his columns, starting as far back as the '80's. Not as hilarious as his fiction, but still brilliant."
3,"It's ""OK""","If you like Carl Hiassen, this rounds out your library. THe newspaer columns are not as intersting as his fiction and golf stories, though."
2,Didn't live up to its recommendation,I was disappointed in this book. I like Carl's juvenile literature much better than his adult books.
5,Loved this Book!,"Plain and simple..... I laughed, I cried, I fell in love! Sophie Kinsella writes this book in so much detail that I actually was feeling what the characters would feel."
5,SOO FUNNY!! and romantic too!!,"How many times did I laugh out loud? Too many to count.Emma is a funny character. Imagine spilling every one of your most private secrets to someone, and finding out later that they're your boss!! Awkward. What makes it even funnier is that Emma's secrets themselves are just downright hilarious. How does Sophie Kinsella even think of this stuff?If you're looking for a good romance with humor, this is your book. Sometimes I just want to read something light and this really hit the mark. The writer really knows how to get the pages turning. Yes, there are formulaic elements to the book, but she puts a new spin on a lot of it so that it feels fresh and different. Her characters are people you want to read more about. And you're rooting for them too. I liked the whole premise. It was fun!I would reread this book, and for me that's pretty rare, so that's saying something!!!!"
4,Just Fun,"Gave me the giggles, quite often. Emma was just a girl trying to find herself and her voice. Typical Sophie Kinsella book, light and fun."
4,Buy this book,"Don't hesitate to buy this book, it's worth every penny. It's a funny story and it's well written. I read the book on one evening, I just couldn't stop reading."
5,BEST KINSELLA EVER!!!,"I've read lots of Kinsella but this is my favorite. LOL funny! Big mouth Emma is a hoot! And I loved how her relationship with Jack, the unbeknownst dashing American CEO of the company she's struggling to survive in, unfolded. If you love Kinsella the way I do, I want to turn you on to another new author and Kindle book that you will equally love, The Body Snatcher Wears Lipstick by Artemis Hunt. Five stars from me! It is so nice to see the great influence Ms Kinsella has had on other chick lit writers! Read these books! You will not be sorry! In fact, you'll be aching for more!"
3,A light and fun read,"This was a very fun chick lit book! Can You Keep a Secret is highly readable if you're looking for something fun and light. I fell right into it and chuckled as Emma revealed all her secrets to the man sitting next to her on the plane. When Emma returns to her work and learns this man is the new CEO, she is horrified. My jaw dropped when he revealed all her secrets on national television. I kicked back and enjoyed the rest of the story, waiting to see how it would unfold and what would happen in Emma's life. It was a light and fun read."
5,Laughed Out Loud!,"Not your typical gags & giggles. Fresh, funny. I actually laughed out loud on a plane all the way from Las Vegas to Tennessee. Wonderful characters. Very light, fun reading."
4,Less impressive than I expected... (three and a half stars),"A big fan of Shopaholic, I got this book the minute it was available in my library (I rarely buy books I'm not 100% sure I'll read again). Frankly, I expected a bit more. Emma just seemed identical to Becky without the shopping need, yet I didn't ""feel her pain"" her as I did with Becky. The writing were great as usual, the plot a bit predictable. As a whole, certainly not about to produce a series."
1,Don't believe all those five stars,"The protagonist: is petty, immature, and mentally deficient; lacks self-confidence, self-respect, self-control, and common sense; needs a boyfriend to legitimize her existence.The object of interest: has no standards in his women (aren't the airheads chosen by high-powered executives at least attractive?); incredibly, got to be a marketing genius and CEO without being able to see an individual's worth -- or lack thereof.The supporting cast: feel like polyester (even cardboard has too much texture and variance).The plot: predictable in the storyline, unpredictable in the stupidity of its details.I love chick flicks because they celebrate our femininity, but I cannot imagine how women are giving away their hard-earned money to an author who asks them to sympathize with an idiot like this."
2,Didnt finish this book,I didnt finsih this book. didnt flow for me. I might try it again when I dont have anything else to read.
2,Boring,"This book was so boring and predictable. It is written in the same manner as ""Bridget Jones Diary"". Same type of main character, same story problem, same solution. I would not recommend it."
3,"Had potential, but it quickly dwindled","I love Sophie Kinsella - ""The Undomesticated Goddess"", ""Remember Me?"", & ""Twenties Girl"" are my all time favorites! The are hilarious and heartwarming. Yet, I wasn't impressed nor in love with this book. If this is your first Sophie Kinsella book, don't write her off as an author, read some of her other books before you rush to any decisions. The story line had sooooo much potential, but it was wasted on a character I just couldn't make myself like. It was a boring and tedious plot, far to predicable, and I ended up feeling sorry more for Conner than anyone else, really. , and I don't think Jack was all that impressive either. The characters in this story seemed flat and stoic. I must also say that I don't like The Shopaholic novels ... I tried to like them, but wasn't impressed, and was, frankly, bored by the story line that wouldn't end (The film version was better ... I know, gasp ... that rarely happens to me!)."
3,"Good, but not great.","Sophie Kinsella creates a warm, funny character in Emma Corrigan. She is young, hip, and worried about the size of her thighs and her wallet. She wants to get ahead at work but is having a hard time finding a career to suit her.It sounds great doesn't it? Well it is... but ... I found myself picturing Emma as Renee Zellwigger in Bridget Jones. Young British girl, body-conscious and a bit clumsy at times, and falling in love with her suave and completely together boss. It all seemed a bit familiar to me. This is why the book gets 3 stars from me.Overall, the book is an engaging, quick read that will make you smile. You'll flip the pages to see what happens next, glancing at the clock and swearing you'll turn off the light soon. But you won't. You'll want to know what happens. The tone is light, and full of charming British words like ""biscuit"" and ""agog."" If you like chik lit, read it. Just don't pay full cover price."
1,Not as addictive as the shopaholic series...But cute.,"I got this book the day it came out, because i was really looking forward to Sophie Kinsella's next realease. The book was still very well written and funny at times, but i felt as though the plot was a little predictable. The book is very easy to read but i preferred the shopaholic series. All in all, it was a good book but i suggest that you borrow it, not buy it. Before i purchase a book i read a lot of reviews to make sure its worth my time. I hope this review is helpful to you."
4,Laughed out loud,"I bought this book from an airport bookstore. I was intrigued by the cover, and I have heard good things about the author and her series. After starting it on the plane, I was instintly pulled in. I did not put it down until I was finished. It was so funny, I was laughing out loud on the plane. Upon getting home, I gave it to my roommate who agreed it was one of the best quick read books she has read in a long time. We both urged our other friends to buy or borrow our copy. So far five of our girlfriends have read it and all love it."
4,The price of honesty,"Emma Corrigan is on an airplane flight after a business trip, when sudden turbulence convinces her that the plane is going to crash. She begins talking to her seatmate and suddenly spills out all of her life's most closely guarded secrets to him. When the plane lands safely, she returns to work only to discover that her seatmate is the president of her company! At first she is mortified, but later she discovers that she has completely charmed Jack, her neighbor on the plane. This is another hilarious book from Sophie Kinsella who excels at ditzy heroines who get themselves in the middle of impossible situations but who eventually land on their feet."
1,"would not recommend, even if it was free","I am sorry to report that this was a horrible waste of my money and time. I really wanted to like it and needed some good laughs. It may very well have been my fault since I also did not get past the sample for the Shopaholic, I should have known not to try this.The dialogue is horrible, I have more interesting and entertaining dialogue with my 12 year hold nephews. I was hoping it would be along the line of a Stephanie Plum story - not even close. Maybe if I was 13 I might have enjoyed the book more.I did read the sample and found it to be mildly entertaining, so I purchased the book. What you read in the sample is basically the best part. Why does everyone start their sentences with 'ER....'.I would not recommend this book even if it was free, sorry, just never takes off."
1,"OMG, What a Waste","I felt absolutely horrible after purchasing this book. Normally, I'd try the free sample offered for a book, but this time I just purchased the book before really trying it out and o'boy did I pay for it (literally). The first chapter was so annoying. I tried and tried to focus, but found my mind wondering off to la la land. I couldn't concentrate on the book at all. I tried to read the 2nd chapter and just gave up. I couldn't even finish the book. The protagonist just rambled on and on about nothing. I didn't see where the story was going. Geez!!! If you have money and time to waste, buy this book."
1,shocking,"It is absolutely shocking that this poorly written book received such high ratings. The dialogue is full of aggravating ""Erm""s and ""Er""s. As in, ""Emma, can I see you in my office?"" Emma replies, ""Er, sure."" Where was the editor? I hated myself for reading this book and the trite story it told. Excuse me while I throw myself into traffic."
3,contemporary chick lit romance,"Meet Emma....an average woman from London who is having a not-so-average day. Since the book has already been described here by other reviewers I'll explain why I couldn't give it more than 3 stars.I love humor in a book. I love all types of romance but I like it when a book makes me laugh. And Sophie kept my interest to the end. Lately, so many books I have read use the 'same-old, same-old' plots. This was something a little different.The sad part is the f-bomb is used throughout this romance. I tolerate it once in a while in a contemporary romance but honestly, does anyone think a person appears attractive saying this word in public? I also thought Emma forgave too easily regarding Jemima and her co-workers but I enjoyed it enough to try some of Sophie Kinsella's other titles."
5,Super clever,"I am an avid reader, and I read quite a lot of so-called chic-lit. Therefore, I was pleasantly surprised to read through this novel, which has a super clever and new theme. The idea behind the story is fresh, and I thought it was superb. It was such an entertaining read, and I loved the characters. I've passed this one on to many friends."
5,Very Fun,"I've read all of the Shopoholic novels and, while I thought they were terrifically fun, this is my favorite from Sophie Kinsella so far. I found myself laughing out loud and I finished the book in record time. If you're looking for a fun escape, read this."
4,A fun book to read,"This is book was very entertaining. A Cute story about a woman making her way in the business world, and at the same time dealing with romance.There are lots of parts that will make you laugh out loud. Any woman trying to balance work and romance can see herself in these situations.A fun, light, humorous read. I was very entertained."
5,Too Funny,This book is soo funny. You can totally see some of this stuff happening to you. I was reading this book everywhere I could and couldn't help but laugh out loud. A really fun read.
5,Great book! Just as funny as the Shopaholic books!!,"Great story! I read this book in one day! Really quick read... you won't be able to put it down! Really easy to get into. Unique storyline, with a nice happy ending."
4,Delightfully enjoyable chick lit,"Yep, I pass as an intellectual on good days, but my deep dark secret is I'm a sucker for Sophie Kinsella books. This one is almost as enjoyable as the original Shopaholic (which, along with Bridget Jones, is my gold standard for chick lit). Yep, we all know where it's going and exactly what is going to happen, but it's sure fun getting there! The main character is fun and the business angle of the plot is interesting. This is a great beach/plane read that will have you smiling."
4,I Laughed Out Loud,"This is just the type of story I love. It's not deep, it's not distubing, it just made me happy. It was so funny at times I literally laughed out loud. I was hysterical when Emma was thinking ""If he says ""G spot,"" I will die. I will die. I will die"" I love living vicariously through characters newly falling in love.I admit it, I love Chick Lit and this book did not disappoint."
4,Decent Vacay Read,"I recently went on spring break and wanted something light and entertaining to read. Can You Keep a Secret definitely fit the bill! It was cute, funny, and engaging. You could tell what was going to happen as the story unfolded, but this isn't a murder mystery novel. Overall, a great easy read."
4,Audiobook Version was entertaining,"I was looking for something light, funny, witty and romantic. This book met the requirements. It wasn't especially thought-provoking, nor was it unique, nonetheless, it was the entertainment I was seeking. I should also mention that the narrator's voice was appropriate for the story. Sometimes, the narrator of an audio-book has a voice which clashes with the intended feel of the storyline; this book was a fine combination. If you are looking for something deep and singular, this is probably not the book for you. Fun and sweet? Give this one a go."
5,"I'm not a reader, but I LOVED this book!!","I joined a book club 6 months ago...mainly to hang out with friends, eat, and drink wine. I finally finished one of our books last month. It was ok. This is our book this month. I LOVED it, finished it early, and couldn't wait to read more and more of it. So entertaining, fun, funny, sweet, you can't not like Emma :) This is officially my fave book, and I want to read all of the other Sophie Kinsella books now!"
1,Chick Literature is not for me,"This is one of the few books from the chick lit genre that I have read. I am quite disappointed as the characters were two dimensional and the plot was predictable. Not to mention the ridiculous and obvious ending, that I will not go into to avoid a spoiler review.I bought the book for an easy read on a flight (another mistake due to the fact that the main character has a panic attack on a plane), though I do have a minimum standard for expectations in any novel that I read. If you are any type of feminist, avoid this book. The heroine does not have a strong character and smacks of desperation...."
3,Entertaining but nothing more,It s an OK book if u are at the beach or on a plane. It s entertaining but for sure not a masterpiece
5,Another Hit,"Love Kinsellas books, she is hilarious in her dialogue and her main characters are always full of spunk and easy to identify with."
3,Not bad,"I really loved Sophie's Undomesticated Godness. However, I'm not as big a fan of this one or the Shopaholic. They are okay. They just did not draw me in as much."
4,"Good summer reading---light, entertaining, & funny","I couldn't get into the ""Shopaholic"" books by this author, so I was pleasantly surprised by this book. It was fun from the first page, never took itself too seriously and, thus, did not disappoint (a la ""Nanny Diaries"" or ""The Devil Wears Prada"")."
3,Almost but not quite...,"In the fashion of the Shopaholic books, this one was addictive, easy and quick to read, and had a number of moments where I found myself laughing out loud... and recieving strange looks from people around me... oh well! My greatest qualm with this one however, was the amount of language. There was an excessive amount of swearing, which was fortunately not seen as much in the Shopaholic books. It often distracted from the story and was rather unnecessary in most cases. For this reason, I am hestitant to recommend it to a number of my friends.So if you are put-off by foul language, stick to the Shopaholic books. If you can get past it, the story is quite humorous, albeit not quite as up to par as her previous works. I would give it 3 and a half stars, if the choice was available."
2,"didn't HATE it, but skimmed to the finish","Well, my first Chick Lit book was ""The Undomestic Goddess,"" (also by Kinsella) which I really enjoyed. So I was really looking forward to reading more of her work. As much as I had to suspend my disbelief for TUG, THIS one was almost impossible. I'd give it 2-1/2 stars if I could. I found myself skimming skimming skimming, and had a difficult time with all the, ""And there was Jack"" moments toward the end. Brother. I didn't hate it, but I kindof wish I could get those hours back so I could invest them in something else."
3,Too Similar to Shopaholic,"Although I love the Shopaholic series, I just couldn't get into reading about Emma as well as I could get into reading about Rebecca Bloomwood. I read the each of the Shopaholic books in 2 days max., but I couldn't stay interested in this one for more than 30 minutes at a time. The plot is similar to that of ""Confessions of a Shopaholic"" (ie- office girl in debt falls for rich boss) but it lacked the humor and in depth look at the characters. The story is a bit drawn out and lacking that ""something"" that makes you want to know what happens between Jack and Emma. Random attempts at creating tension (ie- the fight that ends the first date) are bland and are hardly believable.Despite its flaws, I enjoyed reading this book. It's not something I would read over and over like I do the other series, but it's worth one read. But I would have to say Kinsella's ""Shopaholic"" series is 10 times better!"
4,Can U Keep a Secret ??,"Can You Keep a Secret? by Sophie Kinsella is a delightful, make you laugh out loud kind of novel. It is full of secrets and romantic sense. The story is about a woman named Emma who has many secrets that she keeps to herself. She finally finds a job she likes and after convincing her boss that she can do her job getting a new client to sign with there company, Panther Cola. She drops the ball at the last minute losing her client. On her way back from the U.K. she sits next to a man who she begins to talk to. During the plane ride back they hit some turbulence and Emma thinks she is going to die. She breaks down telling this man all those secrets she never wanted anyone to know. She later finds out that the man she was sitting next was no other then Jack Harper, the American CEO for Panther Cola. Her and Jack end up dating off and on. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to read it. Its an English book, so it's a little hard to understand but its quit funny."
5,Happy for a NEW book!,"I was happy to read a new book from Kinsella that was NOT a Shopaholic book! this book gives us a new character, and a new personailty. It was an enjoyable and amusing book. I finished it in only two days! I loved it!I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a fun easy read!"
5,loved 'secret',"This is by far the best Sophie Kinsella book ever, ive read them all but twienties girl, that arrived this week. I fell for Jack, for the down to earth that this book is. So much more fun, without the intense intrigue of the shoppaholics (in my case a plus). A story is something that could actually happen, wich makes it more interesting. i wanted to read more. the language was easy, for us non-brits. loved loved loved it!!!!!!"
5,Even better than the Shopaholic books!,"People that liked the Shopaholic books, should love this book... as for me - I thought this book was even better... altogether funnier!The character of Emma (she was a bit flaky) was very likable. I am sure that everyone can find some aspect of Emma's life that they can identify with (not getting the promotion they wanted, not being the favorite child, etc). She was a very REAL person.The way the book is written makes you laugh out loud as Emma finds herself in one predicament after another.I won't kid anyone - this book has no deep plot, no twists (you can figure out how its going to end from the beginning)... but its great fun!"
1,Boring and predictable,"I bought this book after reading ""Remember me"", which I absolutely love! What a disappointment! Emma and her friends are annoying and the story is predictable and unrealistic."
1,Not worth reading,"I usually love Sophie Kinsella books and read all the shopaholic books so I was excited to read something else of hers. I was very disappointed with this book. Sure I laughed a couple times, but it wasn't good."
4,Can't wait for the sequel,"Sophie Kinsella proves that with true inspiration, formulas work every time! Thoroughly enjoyable to read this ridiculous story about yet another good-hearted but clueless character. Guilty pleasure - yes! But one I'll never give up as long as she's writing."
3,None,this is probably my least favorite SK book. From stilted characters to clunky plot movement. I found myself skipping quite a bit of the last half of the book.
5,Great!,"Sophie Kinsella is a GREAT story teller. I would read the phone book if she wrote it. This book is yet again, a great easy read. Highly recommend."
4,Quite a Fun Read!,"Can you Keep a Secret was a quick, fun read. With a similar formula of the Shopacholic series, Sophie Kinsella comes up with a new character who steals our hearts from page 1!Emma Corrigan is an average girl, 20-something who's trying to find her path in life. I think she's someone most of us can relate to with job woes, boyfriend woes, family issues etc. The best part of Emma is that she's honest, and funny. The things she says, the things she does and the way she thinks has you almost laughing outloud! The whole story you're hoping, waiting for something to go right for her, and for her to get her happy ending.I really enjoyed the story of Emma. Nearly as much as our beloved Shopaholic Queen. I think Kinsella managed to create another winning character and I wouldn't mind a sequel to this at all! For a quick read over the weekend, a pick-me-up or something to read in between those more heavy novels- Sophie Kinsella's books do the trick!"
1,SOOOOOOO BORING!,"I read the entire Shopaholic series and loved it..this book didn't get off the ground until the final 10 pages. If you want a better read that's more for a mature adult, buy GREEN EGGS & HAM by Dr. Seuss..don't waste your money on this book!"
1,A poor man's Bridget Jones,"This a rip off of the Bridget Jones series. I can just imagine the publisher nodding off to sleep while reading the rough draft. ""Hmmm,the character is shallow,unattractive,below average in intelligence but Bridget Jones sold millions of copies so there has to be an audience for this book."" My daughter's book, HOP ON POP had more substance."
5,Another great book from Sophie Kinsella,"I really enjoy Sophie Kinsella lastest book ""Can You Keep a Secret"" Emma Corrigan is a Londoner with a lot of secrets, during a flight with some bad weather,Emma tells her seatmate all of them thinking that she will never see him again. Well a few days later Emma finds out that her no-named seatmate was in fact her boss Jack Harper. Now Emma is foced to work with a man that knows everything about her.As in other books, Ms. Kinsella offer the reader great characters, with a good pace that hold the readers attention. A book by Sophie Kinsella should not be missed."
1,Awful,"Okay, this is all my fault. The ""Shopaholic"" book (only read the first) was appallingly bad, so what on earth made me think this would be any better?First of all, the main character is an idiot. Please. Gets on a plane, gets nervous and tells some total stranger her ENTIRE life story? And he just sits there and listens? AND remembers every single detail?Secondly, how old is this guy?Third. They have two aborted ""dates"" and she jumps right into bed with him? And he expects her to? I mean, they had, up to that point ONLY KISSED ONCE!And HIS secret? Laughable. Completely laughable.The only use I can find for this book is as a coaster.I honestly don't understand how these awful books keep getting published!"
4,Fun times!,I spend time reading text books and self-help books and Sophie Kinsella provides an entertaining break from reality for me. Her books are just plain fun and I intend to read them all!
4,Light and funny,I actually laughed outload in some parts. The elevator scene was priceless. A great book for a easy read for a weekend.
5,chicklit at its best,"i looved this book! i just had to keep reading. i felt so bad for her, how humiliating that would be!! ahh but definitely addicting! i've reread it a few times so it's definitely worth trying!"
3,"Fun, fast, predictable","This is the story of a marketing assistant who shares her deepest secrets with a complete stranger (tall, dark, handsome) in an alcohol induced soul baring incident while on a plane. It turns out that the man is the owner of the company she works for. Of course, they fall in love after a series of misadventures. The writing is fine and this is a perfect book for a light breezy read. Nothing groundbreaking. Not worthy of discussion at a book club. Basically this is a guilty pleasure read when all of the heavy books you've been reading are starting to suck the joy of reading out of you and you need to reset your meter."
5,KInsella's Best Ever!,"I loved this book! I've read most of Kinsella's books and this one is clearly my favorite. Emma's a hoot and Jack's irresistable! It is such a fun read and there are so many LOL scenes! I recommend it to anyone who wants a fast, enjoyable and memorable read!"
5,What a fun read,This is the first book that i had read of Sophie Kinsella. It was so good that i wanted to read anything she wrote and i have since then and most if not all were just as good if not better. I don't want to give any parts away but i will say that it is a book you must read if you believe in true love at first sight.
4,can you keep a secret?,not going to bore u with facts from the book but my review on it.... laugh out loud funny... the most creative book i read in a while and i loved every part of it... characters were good and u could picture them. story line was funny as. its your typical happy ending girly book. perfect to read for thoes rainy saturday afternoons. highly recommend this book
5,Laugh out loud!,This was my first Sophie Kinsella book and I was not disappointed. It's so funny my tummy hurt from laughing. The characters were likable enough. Just a thoroughly entertaining read.
4,Cure for a drab day,"This was a fun, light, quick read. No, it will not ever qualify as great literature but it was a well-written, laugh-out-loud kind of book. It is a romance more believable than ""Pretty Woman"" but somewhat fantastical compared to real life. Its charm is in the main character's self-deprecating humor."
4,"Between the exam and this book, I finally choose this book!","Well, i'm having my exam this week actually, but when I read the first chapter of this book, I just don't want to put it down even a single second!That's it, it's really great, but however, in my opinion, I think the first few chapters are really quite boring, of course, not any of the others afterwards!Anyway, this is a good book, very interesting one! Even though I have to work harder to catch up my exam after reading this!I really enjoy this book!"
3,MY SECRET IS WAIT FOR THE PAPERBACK VERSION,"Sophie Kinsella no doubt captures the essence (and insecurities) of today's twenty-something single girl. This book will definately have you laugh out loud and root for Emma Corrigan, the lead character. You'll definately be able to relate to some of the secrets she reveals in a terrifying situation (""It was me who jammed the paper copier last week""). The book has a good flow and keeps you interested but just doesnt have the same spark of Kinsella's other books. I felt that the ending was a little too sappy and could have been ended in a much clever way. I would wait until this book comes out in paperback or check it out of the library. I'd save a few extra dollars and put it towards purchasing Kinsella's hilarious Shopaholic books."
1,Waste of time,"This story was ridiculously predictable and annoying.The main character is often in situations that she supposedly finds unbearable, but does nothing to change them when she easily could(being ""forced"" into a hideous costume at the company picnic, being put down by family members constantly, being stuck with her family while Jack is waiting for her). I could go on and on.She's just a complete idiot and I could not relate to her. It makes me wonder how I'm supposed to believe that any man is interested in her, much less a brilliant, successful marketing genius."
1,Predictable,"I just finished the book, and am so bored by its predictability! Wow, I just didn't think books like this were being written anymore. From the Shopaholic series which were great (the first 2 anyway) to this. A big slide downhill. This book would be fine if this was your first look into chick lit/romance fiction."
3,"Slow start, but ends better",This book gets off to a very slow start and is not as catching as Kinsella's Shopaholic series. The story line isn't revealed until about half-way through the book when it finally gets interesting.
4,Fun Read!,"If you are a fan of Sophie Kinsella then you will most definitely find her newest novel absolutely delicious. Who doesn't have a secret? I found myself completely absorbed in the mindlessness of the story but hey, that's what leisurly reading is about. No one said this was going to be a classic. If you are looking for light, easy read then don't pass this one up!"
5,I loved it!!!,This book was excellant. I could not put it down. I recommend that every woman order this book today. It was great! I loved Jack!!!
3,fluffy brainless fun,"Another book to support Kinsella's perky thesis that if you're a spunky, pretty young gal you can do awful things or be a terrible person and it will be cute and funny and all will turn out well. You can see what's coming a mile ahead in this book, plot-wise, but let's face it, there's good dark chocolate and then there're Jolly Ranchers, and sometimes the cheap overly sweet crap is just what you need."
5,Love Sophie Kinsella!!!,"I cannot say that there is a Sophie Kinsella book that I don't love! I relate to the characters, laugh out loud and find them impossible to put down! This book was no different! I loved everything about it! My only gripe is I wish she would write faster! I cannot wait for her next books to be published so that I can love them too!"
4,Good read,It was a very good book. It was very funny and kept my interest through until the end. I recommend it.
3,A light fun read,"Sophie Kinsella is the perfect weekend read. Fun characters trying to deal with work, life and romance. Always a fun read."
4,Your secret is out!,"Emma is a character that women can relate to. She just wants the simple things in life, but feels she needs to keep secrets in order to belong. I recommend this book if you're looking for a good read that you can get lost in. The characters come to life on the pages and you'll find yourself wishing the best for Emma."
5,I can't keep a secret!!,"I've recently read this book, for the reason that I wanted to read something light and romantic for a change. The secret is out...it was absolutely hilarious! I couldn't put the book down -Sophie Kinsella did a great job with Emma Corrigan, the quirky funny 20-something character along with her drama w/ her family, dull boyfriend, backstabber officemates, and romantic tensions with Jack. If you need a good laugh and feel better for not lying about your underwear size, I highly recommend this book a must read."
5,Cute Chic Lit... an easy read!,"After reading the shopoholic series I knew I would like this book as well. Sophie Kinsella has a way of writing that reminds me of the way we talk with girlfriends, or even what we don't share with girlfriends.After meeting a handsome man on a plane and just spilling her guts her little world get turned upside down. At the end of the book I wanted it to be a little longer, I wanted to know what happened next. Maybe a series or a part 2 is needed for one of those weekends I want to spend curled up with a good book!"
3,This is no Shopaholic book,"In the Shopaholic series, we had Becky Bloomwood with her passivity and tendency to stick her head in the sand balanced by her witty confessionals about shopping and some funny moments. In this novel, Kinsella again brings back a vapidly passive main character, and the formula falls flat on its face, without the witticisms to save it. Emma is beyond belief in her wishy-washiness, letting everyone around her ruin her life while she sits on and says nothing. As a reader, I was irritated with the main character, and her dilemmas seemed dreadfully drawn out, with the conclusion obvious to the reader from miles away.The Shopaholic books are charming gems of chick lit. Kinsella does not score so high on this novel."
5,Can You Keep a Secret is Fabulous!,"I stayed up all night reading Can You Keep a Secret. So did my sister. I've recommended it to countless friends. It's a great bit of chic lit with a few twists. Kudos to Sophie Kinsella on a well-written, fun story perfect for a weekend at the beach or a rainy day. Enjoy!"
4,Perfect for a rainy weekend,"I thought this was quite cute, and it was perfect rainy weekend reading. Once I got past Emma's extremely flighty inner dialogue, I found that I couldn't put it down! Don't look for any depth here, but there's a lot of fun and a little bit of romance. I'd probably pick up some of Kinsella's other standalone novels."
4,"Fun, easy read","I thought this was an easy read and entertaining. I enjoyed it, liked the characters, and loved Emma! This is a fun book, great for the airplane"
5,What a great surprise!,I loved this book from the first page that contained a funny numbered list. I loved Emma at all times. She was a fun character and had me laughing out loud on more than one occasion. I liked that I was predicting potential conflicts with the main characters and was wrong. This was a great read! I now need more from Sohpie Kinsella.
4,Wonderful book,I was hooked on this easy read from the beginning! Very entertaining story and difficult to put down.
4,Great lazy day read!,"Emma is a character you can totally relate with and the things she is going through in her life, we can all relate to in some shape or form. I read this book in a day. It's a great book to read on a day you are feeling lazy and just want to sit back and escape the every day stress of your own life. I really hope Sophie Kinsella rights a sequel to this book - I would love to know what happens next with Emma & Jack!"
5,Amazing! Fast Read!,"I completely loved this book! This was the first Sophie Kinsella book that I read, even though my mother kept telling me to read The Undomestic Goddess, which I read as soon as I finished this one. I read this book in a total of 36 hours from the time I bought it at school to the time I finished it the next day. It was so funny, and I didn't even mind the fact that it was written in first person. Anyone who likes Jennifer Crusie will love this book!"
2,Mildly entertaining after 54 pages,"I nearly chucked this book because it looked like nothing of interest was going to happen in the first 50 pages (the Nancy Pearl rule of thumb). Thankfully, it finally picked up around page 54 when Jack enters the picture. I find his character endearing, and the rest of the book offers some mindless entertainment as you follow Emma's story through her relationships, career mishaps, and peculiarities. Read this for - as I've said already - mindless entertainment."
5,"romantic, funny, good premise~book has it all","Sophie Kinsella has made me start reading fiction! What a clever, easy flowing book. You really can see yourself in Emma Corrigan(main character) sometimes."
1,totally overrated,"i would have given it two stars if i had not expected so much from this book. there is not much romance in this book,too many secondary characters,not much chemistry,no sexual tention,i skimmed through most of the book,was not able to finish it. it is a PG13 lightweight situation comedy with a little romance. i should stick to historical romance."
3,What's the hold-up?,Why did it take ten days for me to receive when another book ordered at the same time from another vendor took only six days? I'll go with the more efficient vendor in the future.
4,"A good, refreshing read","Very enjoyable read. It made me often laugh aloud. I found the writing very lively and sparkling. I really enjoyed the dialogues, and sympathize with the characters.Despite that, I found not very believable how Jack publicly betrays Emma's trust. Even more so, it was hardly believable that she forgive him so quickly, after he gives away all her secrets, humiliating her. He even refers to her as ""a nothing-special girl""! IMHO, this impasse would have requested a little more efforts (and pages) to be solved."
4,Everyone has secrets!,"I thought this book was a delightful, light, funny, quick read. I enjoyed the concept - it was different and unique. The book also had several laugh-out-loud moments. I liked the character of Emma - an ordinary girl with relatable problems with her boyfriend, family and friends - and I enjoyed watching her grow more confident in herself as the book went on. The book wasn't perfect... it does stick to the formula of chick lit books which makes the plot predictable (but enjoyable in a no-thinking-required way). I felt that the ending wasn't as strong as the rest of the book - there is a secondary plot twist at the end that is unnecessary and just makes the book last longer without adding much to it."
4,You will not be disappointed,"Cute book. Up to par with most good chic lit. Pretty much what you expect, some very funny parts, a decent plott, and a happy ending."
4,A bright cheer-me-up story!,"Sophie Kinsella writes with such a unique style and an entertaining wit - this book was hilarious and I literally laughed out loud as I was reading it! I enjoyed it even more than the other Kinsella books I've read because Emma was a more realistic and less over-the-top hero compared to Becky of the Shopaholic series, so it was easier to relate to her."
5,MY FAVORITE BOOK EVER!,"I absolutely love this book. It was funny and relatable. I couldn't put this book down, the times I had to I couldn't stop thinking about when I could begin reading it again. You will not be dissapointed!"
4,Kate Reading as Narrator,"Kate Reading does an excellent job narrating this tale. She puts a lot of emotion into her portrayal of Emma and also does a great job at giving different voices to the other characters. I find sometimes that audiobooks can put me to sleep because the narrators drone on in monotone voices, but that is not the case here!"
5,This book is so funny and also romantic!,"I picked this book up to take on vacation with me a couple of weeks ago. I had not yet read the Shopaholic series, but I was intrigued and thought I'd give Kinsella a try (of course I have now read her other books and they are great too!).... I loved this book so much, I couldn't put it down! I have recommended it to every woman I know. It is funny, mortifying, and terribly romantic at the same time! Definitely give this book a try!"
2,BORING,"I LIKE THE AUTHOR BUT THIS BOOK WAS BORING . . . I NEVER FINISHED IT, COULDN'T EVEN TELL YOU WHAT IT WAS ABOUT!DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY."
2,Not Again!,"I loved the Shopaholic books by Sophie and I am enjoying ""Can You Keep a Secret"" to some degree but, since I work as an Administrative Assistant, I find the book very condescending to those in my profession. No doubt she has a good sense of humor but if you work in my field you may find the book to be insulting. I'm really tired of authors (and everyone else in the world) thinking that degrading Secretaries and Admin Assistants is a good subject for their writing. I deal with enough condescension in my everyday life, I don't need to pick up a book which I'm expecting to enjoy and then have another person hit me in the face with insults. I'm most likely done with this author because of this."
5,Perfect getaway!,I picked up the book after getting into HUGE argument with my mother and it was the best remedy! I found myself laughing hysterically as things would unwind with the book. It is an extremely easy read and perfect to pick up for just a little time off from reality!! I'm really hoping that she does another book like this one!
3,Can You Keep a Secret?,"While at the basic core of it all, the plot is an interesting and enjoyable one, that's really all it is--basic. There are no subplots, and plenty of minor characters that could have had interesting stories. Kinsella's storytelling has, no doubt, developed over time, as Remember Me? certainly had subplots. Still, this is not her best work. It was easier to get into than the other books, starting off very interestingly while the others took a while to really get interesting. It's definitely a good premise (if not highly Queen of Babble-ish, although I'm pretty sure this came first), and was delivered well, just lacked oomph. It's all told in a little bubble though, in her office and small parts elsewhere. Just a little too little.Rating: 3.5/5"
4,One Fun & Interesting Secert!,"The book is full of humor, romance, and life lessons, which is the perfect recepie for a chick lit. The book was filled with great characters that you end up falling and routhing for. ""Can You Keep a Secert?"", is full of fun, juicy, and delicious secerts that keeps you wanting more!"
3,Read the first half; skim the rest,"This is just my second experience with chick lit. If they're all like this, I won't be trying too many more. One reviewer said it was a roller-coaster ride, and I agree ... though the entire second half the book seemed pretty low.At first I was tickled with Emma and her silly, funny thoughts. Her self-doubt was endearing. Her secrets were so charming. And the mysterious man? Oh, I wanted to know more! But then, once she made an extremely abrupt decision involving her boyfriend, the rest of the book lacked not only credibility but also humor and interest. I laughed at loud at the beginning, yet I had to search hard for anything entertaining after mid-way through. What a let-down! At least it was a quick read, and a not-altogether unpleasant one at that."
3,mmmkay,"This book was OK - I didn't really like it as much as I like the Shopaholic series or even as much as I liked ""Remember Me?"" It was cute and fun - a quick, easy read, but just left me wanting a little something more. I can't really put my finger on what was missing, but the storyline and the characters didn't appeal to me quite as much as I had hoped they would. It was predictable and light..... but not my favorite Kinsella novel. It would be a great book to throw in your beach bag for an easy summer read."
5,great conflicts and hilarious resolutions!,"it is such a fast read. i absolutely loved it! this is my first review, and im going to buy another by sophie."
4,"Light, campy humor, and a quick read",This was a cute story - predictable as it was...Very light and breezy type of feel to it. Exceptionally quick read complete with likable characters. If you are looking for some mindless enjoyment in the chick lit genre then you should give this book a try. The only problem I had with this book (aside from the predictability factor) was that the main character Emma comes off as a real idiot/airhead.
3,Not what I was waiting for!,"I have to say, I was a bit let down by this book. I am a huge fan of Ms. Kinsella's Shopaholic series, and I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy of this. I made my husband drive me to a bookstore while were on vacation, so I could get this book the day it came out. I have to admit, if I wasn't an insomniac, I may not have finished it, but it is an easy read, so I was able to polish it off in a couple of nights. Now, for the part about why I didn't like it. This kind of book is not deep, so I wasn't expecting that, however, I was hoping to connect with the character, or even the story, and I didn't do either. Sort of amusing, and I'm sorry to say, sort of boring. Sorry Ms. Kinsella! If you havn't rushed out to buy this, borrow a copy or wait for paper. This book won't stop me trying her next one, but I just didn't think it was up to the Shopoholic books. Next time!"
2,"Shopaholic fan, but disappointed in this book.","I have read all three of the shopaholic books, in fact I've re-read them! I'm a HUGE fan of that series! I was so looking forward to seeing what the author would do in this book. But in all honesty, I thought ""Can You Keep A Secret?"" was a total re-tread of the shopaholic books, except the main character is not addicted to shopping. The whole set-up, the main character's personality, the supporting characters (co-workers, sexy leading man who happens to be a corporate big-wig, room-mate), were so similar to the shopaholic books. I was really disappointed, and felt this new book was just a watered-down ""shopaholic"" story."
3,Good Quick Read,"I only gave it 3 stars b/c I liked it and thought it was a cute, quick read, but not as wonderful as her shopaholic books. I am glad I got it, but can't wait for more shopaholic books. I love those.Enjoy!!Lisa"
3,Sssshh!! Tell You A Secret About Sophie Kinsella....,"I think Sophie Kinsella found inspiration for this book ""Can You Keep A Secret?"" from her much earlier publication of another title under her real name of Madeleine Wickham. As some of you may know by now, Sophie Kinsella is her pen name.In ""The Wedding Girl"" by Madeleine Wickham, secrets abound among many characters. In one sub-plot, there is a secondary character who is a much younger lady who falls for a much older man. Emma Corrigan and Jack Harper must have sprung forth from this liasion in this earlier book ""The Wedding Girl"" as the teasing is very similar to that of the yound lady & much older man seen in ""The Wedding Girl"".The treatment of secrets is more frivolous in ""Can You Keep A Secret?"" whereas in ""The Wedding Girl"" its more rooted in reality.So for those of you curious enough to find out about Sophie Kinsella earlier books, I mean Madeleine Wickham then read ""The Wedding Girl"" to continue with her secrets theme."
5,"This is a ""Must Read""","I absolutely LOVE Sofie Kinsella's ""Shopaholic"" series, but this book was even better! I haven't ever laughed so much while reading. In fact, my dog got so annoyed with me that he actually slept in the hall outside my bedroom the night I read this because I kept laughing out loud while he was trying to sleep! This book is definitely a ""must read"" - it's fast, funny and you don't want to put it down!"
4,Confessions of a social fibber,"A great premise. Woman on lurching plane nervously blabs all she feels guilty about to her seatmate, a perfect stranger, only to find out later that he owns the company she works for. This book was fun and thought-provoking (honesty is the best policy, and while it would be difficult to tell a friend you don't like the gifts they give you, but Emma's fibs were out of control. I had just a minimum of trouble understanding British terminology (I'm not going to say I can't understand English!) The ending was especially cute. I was, however, let down by Jack's Big Secret, which to me wasn't any big deal.I notice that many readers who've read the Shopaholic series expressed disappointment in this book. I haven't read the series yet, but I intend to. I'm looking forward to it. From the reviews I've read I might like these even better!"
5,An Unforgettable Main Character,"Emma's actions are hilarious. She finds herself in some tight situations and the average woman would have given up, but not Emma.What I found delightful about this book is how the author allows the reader to experience the situations along with Emma.This is the first book I've read by this author. I can't wait to read her others."
2,From a disappointed skeptic....,"The book was interesting and readable; however, it clearly states that you, on your own, cannot be cured. It requires intervention by professionals (preferably at a clinic) and the details of the treatment appear to be purposely vague. Since there is so little information on this subject available and medical treatment is practically nonexistent, it is certainly better than nothing but do not expect a magic cure."
3,A Way Forward,"The book focuses more on the dyspareunia associated with Vaginismus rather than as a separate pain issue, so I was disappointed as the title suggests the book deals with pain in general. Expensive mistake to make! However, for those who do suffer with Vaginismus this is a good way forward to treatment and possible cure. Didn't help me though, different pain issues."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!,"Don't buy this book. Huge waste of money and is just basically an advertisement. If you want to learn more about painful sex, you don't need to spend money...there is so much free information on the Internet, not to mention that that this place the authors keep promoting costs an arm and a leg and there are other places you can get even BETTER help for much less!!!! Google Vaginismus treatment and keep your options open before you start refinancing your house!!"
1,No compassion,"This book might give you insight to other womens suffering. Stop there! After reading this book and calling this Dr (?) to arrange for a session at this office, I was told the ""cure"" rate was 100%. They failed to state that the CURE rate was calculated by including only people who came back! I was called a WIMP during my second visit. Totally horrific and umcompassionate methods. What are they thinking!"
2,Low power and eats batteries,I was very unimpressed with this transmitter. So unimpressed in fact that I stopped using it after a couple of weeks.The device's power is so low that it constantly suffered from interference from other signals. At its best the sound quality was poor and at worst it was swamped by the local radio stations. On top of all that the battery only lasted about 3 or 4 hours. If you have to have one of these make sure you place it as close to the radio's antenna as possible. For me that meant putting it on the back seat - not very convenient!I had almost given up on these things until I saw the one from iRiver which is truly great and well worth the money. Granted it only works in the car but that's where I use it so that's not an issue.
2,Big disappointment,This book really does not explain wavelets well at all. Very few examples. Very difficult reading; clumsily written. Equations are used where a few lines of text would have been a great help.
3,Boredoms - 'Chocolate Synthesizer' (Reprise),"Didn't like this CD quite as much as I did their 'Super Ae' effort (see my review). Perhaps just too noisy experimental for most, I guess. This fifteen track CD doesn't exactly suck. It just isn't as good as the only disc I've heard (so far) from this Japanese ensemble. Couple of the tunes here I thought were decent are ""Shock City"", ""Action Synthesizer"" and the odd-sounding ""Smoke 7"". Still need to explore more of this band's work."
2,The music is shallow and goes nowhere..,"This whole Electro-clash thing is a major fad for 2003/2004 and Keoki is jumping on the bandwagon. I fully expect his style will be radically different a few years from now unlike his past where he matured and grew with the music, now he just leaps onboard to do what others are doing in an ""Americanized"" way.For what it's worth, the songs are just ok. I don't feel any emotion or drive behind the mix like I have with past Keoki mixes, including his own remix work. You have to be in one of those non-emotional moods to get into this.Still, I feel it's a dead end mix. You're not left with any depth or emotion you would typically feel from past Keoki mixes or other ""modern"" DJs."
3,Something New?,"First of all, I love Keoki.I do not, however, like this CD nearly as much as his previous CDs. I saw a video interview with Keoki where he explained that disco still sucks, but I hear disco influence in almost every track. Perhaps this is the clash. I find this overly tame and not nearly as sexy. I would still recommend it to any Keoki lover, but for someone who doesn't know his work I would definitely play other CDs for them first.I give this one a 3 in what I actually like, but it's a 1 in comparison to his other albums. My favorite CD of his is Alien Invasion to give you an idea of where I am coming from."
2,this just goes NOWHERE,"I was always under the impression that DJ mix albums were supposed to take the listener on a ""trip"". This one starts out promising, with the bitchy commentary of ""It's Over"" but quickly goes nowhere fast. Terribly disappointing."
5,incandescent and inspiring,"positively beautiful. I've loved this book since i was five years old. Because it is out of print it is a shame that not everyone can own it. The illustrations are superb and magickal. I think i like them even better than the poems. Everyone who enjoys the company of faeries should own a copy of this book, so search for it to the ends of this earth and realms beyond if you must. It is a must have!"
3,Picture misleading,"My advice is to buy a size smaller than you think will fit. This corset is decently constructed, but will not give you that 'sexy' shape unless you get a size smaller."
4,Nice but!!,Nice sound and design but it the keys snap out easily so handle with care and keep away from babies cause once they discover how easy it is to take the keys out they never stop.
4,really cool if the covertable top would open,This car would be really cool if the convertable-looking top would open. I purchased this car at a local store and when i first opened it actually BROKE the top trying to open it. Don't make the same mistake I did!!! p.s. Maisto is a gr8 company and i recommend their cars to any die cast enthusiast.
3,A challenging read,"I actually didn't finish this book. It's a really intriguing look at an iconoclastic woman and her somewhat odd companions, told in unconventional style. The narrative is pretty straightforward, but the characters' thought processes, dialogues, and motivations are not. I could not devote my full attention to it before it was due back at the library, and I was unable to renew it. I'll give author Stacey Levine another try, sometime, though."
1,Painful,"It's amazing how the Penthouse organization has so rapidly squandered the value of its big brand name. This video has a few moments but mostly the models are not attractive (and some of them appear painfully uncomfortable), production assets are absolutely zilch, and no imagination at all went into the scenarios, unless you imagine a ""college girl"" having to write ""I will not be a bad girl"" on the blackboard particularly believable and/or titillating."
1,What a rip-off!,"There's only ONE reason to buy a Penthouse DVD instead of a Playboy DVD, and that's because Penthouse does scenes involving GIRLS-WITH-OTHER-GIRLS so much better than Playboy!Now look closely at the box cover of this DVD --- what do you see? You see two pretty college female cuties close together, don't you?BUT NOWHERE ON THIS ENTIRE VIDEO ARE TWO GIRLS SHOWN DOING ANYTHING TOGETHER!!! This is simply a solo-girls-doing-nothing video, which Playboy does so much better than Penthouse! This one's a complete rip-off!"
5,His best,"Originally released in 1965 as a limited edition, this project represents Harry Owens' last and finest orchestrations of his best-known songs as he would like to have them remembered."
5,what Heaven smells like,"Loooove this candle, the smell is fantastic. FYI the smell *is* strong, so it will saturate a room fairly quickly. I won't leave it lit for more than an hour because it becomes too overpowering. It's great for winter when windows are closed from the cold and homes become musty, this candle will definitely get rid of that musty smell."
1,NOT AS ADVERTISED,The product description on the packaging says that it seals the sandwich. It doesn't. It only cuts the sandwich and isn't even designed to seal. I wish I could have seen the cutting side of the device as it would have been obvious that this thing can't seal any bread.
2,Not the cap I expected to receive,"Although the diameter of the cap lens bought is correct, based on the image, the one I received is different."
4,Finally a waterproof low vision watch!,"Ok, so I am legally blind and I have been getting watches that look just like this one from Independent Living Aids--but they are so sensitive to moisture that if I even sweat a little they start running slow. I was missing appointments, running late everywhere, couldn't depend on them. I finally found this watch on Amazon and it said it was waterproof. I purchased it with skepticism, but I've had it for several months now and have gotten it really wet with no problems. I only gave it four stars because once or twice it HAS started running slow--but only about 10 minutes behind regular time and it seems it might have been a fluke, don't know. Overall I'm very happy with the watch, so much more dependable."
3,There are better books on the topic.,"I purchased this book at the suggestion of a top sea kayaking coach. I should note that many paddlers consider this book the encyclopedia or ""standard"" of sea kayaking navigation books. The book is lengthy and appears to be comprehensive, however, I found it to be poorly organized and presentation lacking. It is a decent desktop reference on the subject, if you are looking for specific information on a sea kayaking navigation topic. It is tough to just pick this book up and learn navigation. It is really not layed out for self-instruction.I would strongly recommend ""Simple Kayak Navigation"" by Ray Killan over Burch's book. It is concise, easy to understand, comes packed with excellent examples, and has just the right amount of humor."
3,Nothing really sticks,"Melodine are a band destined to fall through the cracks of the music business. They have a good sound that isn't quite original enough. They have good songs that aren't quite good enough. They have a good album that isn't quite... well, you know. With a sound reminiscent of late-era Replacements or pop-friendly Goo Goo Dolls, Appreciation is an album of solid modern rock tunes that lean well to the pop side of alternative. Call it Modern Rock Lite. It's a good listen, with a nice mix of tunes, but nothing really sticks."
3,It's Just Ok,"It is a nice chain, but in my opinion, the pictures do not give an accurate account of the necklace. This is not a tightly structured byzantine necklace."
5,Thrilled 10 year old,I bought this as a surprise first day of school gift for my 10 year old son. I couldn't believe how excited he was about the watch and all of its features. He has been thanking me for two days and has independently set the watch and using features. It is lightweight and easy to put on alone. very pleased!
2,Not water resistant!,"Note that this watch is not at all water resistant. 8 months after purchase, it is fogging up on the inside, and the light no longer works. My son doesn't swim or bathe with it, but I am sure it gets splashed on when he washes his hands."
1,Water-Resistance Incorrect,"Purchased watch in April 2011. Son wore it to our community pool a few times, display showed water damage and no longer works. With shipping cost and $7 service fee required under warranty, I might as well purchase a new watch. Would not buy again."
4,"First one broke, second has been good",One of the buttons stopped working after 3 days on the first watch we received. Amazon immediately sent a replacement. The second one has worked well. My 10 year old son really likes it. He uses the stopwatch often.
1,Classics for Trailer Trash!,"Listening to the clips makes me want to puke! This musical ""group"" have ruined some fine pieces of music. The non-popped-up originals stand perfectly well on their own. If you want to introduce yourself or your kids to classical music, listen to the real thing. The music on this CD is for trailer trash who want to delude themselves into thinking they're classy."
3,NILE,"Anna is a recently divorced wwoman who decides to go to Egypt on a vacation for refreshment. She also takes a scent bottle and a journal of her great great grandmother, Louisa. Louisa made her journey to Egypt during the mid nineteen hundred and she was accompanied by her guide Hassan. the scent bottle isnt an ordinary one, its very sacred and Carstairs want it. The scent bottle was a gift from Hassan to Louisa. The scent bottle belongs to the lords. Anna keep on reading Louisa's journal and meanwhile her adventure continues too as so many people in the ship envied her scent bottle and she has been pursued by Carstairs. The adventure begins........"
1,Not Sung by Original Artists!,"I would only buy this cd if you want to laugh for a few hours. I was expecting original hits, but I guess I should have known better for $12. At first listen I thought it was the real thing, but then I realized it was people trying to sound like the original artists. Some are so bad you have to laugh. The rest of it is just a disappointment. I think I'll re-wrap it and give it to my cousin as a Christmas gift."
1,Warning: May permanently damage your music appreciation,"We got suckered: these are not the original artists but horrible covers - they must have chosen the singers to try and match the original singer's vocal tone and without much regard to actual singing skills. Besides, even if this set had great singers I would still want the real thing not cover bands!!!! This set is so bad that I don't feel right trying to sell or even give it away; maybe to someone I don't like much or as a gag gift."
2,Do yourself a favor,"If you already own a digital camera that you like, do yourself a favor and look to see if a underwater housing is available for it. Obtaining any type of support from these folks is difficult at best. E-mail response is slow and not very helpful. The included memory is good for 6 pictures, so plan on buying more memory. Do not believe it when they tell you you can substitute AA batteries if your recharables are out of power. They will only last for 4 shots before the camera stops working.I found a housing for my Olympus from the manufacturer that lets me use my full digital camera functions for less than the cost of this camera. This camera now just sits on my desk to remind me not to do this again!"
3,Helpful for cartooning,There was a minor error re. one of the Power Puff Girls which suggests sloppy editing. But the big fan of the PPGs in our house loves how the book has taught her how to draw all of the characters.
4,Difficult to believe this is not a true story,"California writer Lynn Freed spins the tale of Agnes La Grange, a plucky young Englishwoman who has immigrated to So. Africa after WWI. The greatest pleasure of this book is engrossing yourself in Agnes's desires: she wants to experience adventure and passion without feeling she's being dominated by a man. Remember, this was the Edwardian era, when women were given more to fits of the vapors that to fits of passion. It's a pleasure to read along as Agnes struggles not to succumb to the mores of her time.As author Freed grew up in South Africa, her book is all the more compelling for its presumed accuracy. At least, it feels accurate, a sense lent credence by the photographs which are included."
1,A dull bodice ripper at best,"I'm a Lynn Freed fan but found Agnes utterly undeveloped: there's no backstory for the unapologetic narcissistic behavior: business, her lovers, her husband, her own daughter, her (?) friends. Take a pass ... even the supposed eroticism is so veiled as to be barely evident."
4,Lacks a certain flow.,"This story was not as compelling as the reviews I read, but it was enjoyable none-the-less. Agnes LaGrange is an incredibly independent, fiesty, passionate (in many senses), forthright, and bold woman - someone to admire in the late 90's let alone the early part of the century. She holds very little back when it comes to opinions and physical flirtations. She usually gets what she wants whether it is from a husband, lover, friend, or family member. In some parts I found the writing confusing and had to re-read passages...the flow wasn't clear and I wasn't sure which character was being discussed. The presentation of the book's physical layout itself was interesting, in fact, that's what drew me to it in the first place. I'd recommend this story to a fellow reader with the comment that it was good, but not memorable."
2,Not much here,"I wasn't surprised when I read that Ms. Freed wrote the initial short story in one sitting. The story has a magazine (Cosmo?)feel to it, like its intended audience is composed of sixteen-year-old girls. And girls, in my opinion, deserve better than this age-old fanciful tale of a brash woman. Willa Cather, for one, does a far better job."
5,Great CD - worth much more that the price!,Wonderful Big Band sound and tunes that all will be familiar with.
5,An original study on leadership.,"I'm the head of a small, non-profit organization so I was not sure whether this book would actually be of much interest. But as one of the reviewers on the book-jacket writes, this book should be very useful to people outside universities as well. It is well-written and very engaging. What makes it especially appealing is the author's ability to take ""academese"" and convert it into understandable English. His chapter on leadership is one of the most original I have seen and the discussion of ""resiliency"" is fascinating. He also presents six detailed case studies and each is written essentially to stand alone. The first three chapters lay out a conceptual blueprint and this makes each case easier to interpret. His use of compelling anecdotes and well-researched historical passages really bring the cases to life. Highly recommended."
2,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"Much too mellow to really be considered ""techno"". Classical-maybe, slow, I almost fell asleep."
4,Good Book,This book offered some good tips on job searches however I have found other places more helpful. One extremly helpful site is [...]. This website has a huge listing of jobs and they are all directly from employer websites. I have found this site to list more jobs by far than any other job board site. Very helpful site! Go check it out.
4,"Great program, but non-anamorphic!","This is a great 5-part (50 min per episode) program about ancient Egypt. One star is deducted because Kultur authored the programs in non-anamorphic widescreen. If you no longer use a 4:3 TV, you get to watch a postage-stamp sized picture on your widescreen TV (black bars on top and larger black bars on the sides). Hell, the picture is even smaller than you would see when watching a standard 4:3 program on a widescreen TV. I would ramp my review up to 5 stars if Kultur would remaster this title! Don't be fooled by the 16:9 widescreen format listed on the back--unless, of course, you're still watching on a 4:3 TV!"
5,The best DVD on ancient egypt!!!,"For a fraction of the costs of an archeology program, relax at home and enjoy this marvellous DVD about an extraordinary civilization. You will not regret it!!!"
3,Whoomp! There It Is (And It's not that hot!),"Now, this is just Tag Team's so-called top hits. I would recommend this to someone that doesn't have the earlier albums or just wants to check out some old school hip-hop. I'll tell you that this is not the best album, and that the only good song is Whoomp!, but check it out if you wanna party with some not so popular songs. This CD is hot if you want to bring back the early 90's hip-hop but other than that I would recommend getting CDs from Dr. Dre, Eminem, Kid Rock, and Limp Bizkit to really get your party started where ever that may be, at home, if you are DJing (I would recommend vinyl copies), birthday parties, anywhere. Get this if you don't wanna chill to the top hits, but I would recommend the top hits, not this."
4,"Great looking ride, but not that durable","At the time I purchased this, my sons were 5 and 3 years old. Energetic, but they aren't the kind of kids who go out of their way to see who can break their toys first. They seemed to have fun with it, until it lost a wheel. At which point it was relegated to the bottom of the toy chest, destined to make occasional appearances here and there. Probably better suited to be a display model than one that actually gets played with. My mistake. Thankfully, I didn't pay much for it."
3,"Very Cute, but over priced","As you can see, it's an adorable belly ring but I was a bit dissappointed that the lady bug is hollow. Also, the bar is long, so it's hard to situate it comfortably... I would have returned it just for that (Because for $100, I want to be downright thrilled about my purchase) but Body Candy DOES NOT ACCEPT RETURNS... so purchase cautiously."
5,My ears are very pleased,I am fairly picky with audio. These are excellent speakers. The base response is acceptable. All audio ranges are very clear and accurate.
2,Not a very good book,"I was very surprised with the quality, or lack of quality of the book and the subject matter. Poor layout, poor pictures, the binder is falling apart and the material is flawed with issues. For the prices, it is not worth it!!!!!! Go find another book. Can anyone help me on this issue?"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The '70s are scary.Especially if you are an 11th century bloke transported in time to this particular period.Apart from dodgy trousers you have to deal with all the technological stuff that you just think is magic, and only get a kid to help hide you from everyone.Then there is that little problem of magically finding your way back in time.2.5 out of 5"
3,A good idea- but ..,"This is a very good idea, and it provides a lot of interesting information. For instance on Coffee which was first drunk in the Ethopian highlands, and had its first 'house' in Turkey, and then had its first English appearance in 'Lloyd's 'in London which was to become the center of the world's insurance industry. Information of this kind is fine. And there is something here I am sure for everyone interested in accumulating information about the origins of various products, institutions. But the book takes on very big subjects such as the origins of the major religions and does them very scant justice. It is superficial in its writing about major topics.In its excessive simplicity on complex subjects it is also often simply wrong about the things.This is a good idea but it could have been done in a far more interesting, informative and sound way."
5,A Great Gift Book For Trivia Lovers,"If you love pub quizzes and trivia, you'll love this book of 'firsts'. It's crammed with surprising and intriguing facts about when things started. It's the perfect gift book - everything is written in short sections so that it can be picked up and put down if you're pressed for time. It's a treasure trove of information on the origins of everything - from musical instruments to mobile phones, from toasters to trainspotting, and from pistols to plastic surgery."
2,Problem with Set 5 Masonic Mysteries.,"I enjoy Inspector Morse but unfortunately the DVD ""Driven to Distraction"" malfunctioned when played. It would stop, skip and start again, sometimes the sound would not work. At the beginning of Sins of the Fathers, the focus was often blurry. As expensive as these DVD's are, I would expect better quality.I would certainly appreciate a replacement of the malfunctioning DVD's"
1,"SDH for hearing impaired, where is it?","Why are none of these newly released DVD's not Closed Captioned or SDH for the Hearing Impaired in region 1 USA. Add the English Accent, in these videos and how can you understand the story. SDH the Videos Acorn. These video's should not be sold in the USA without SDH for hearing impaired."
2,granite gold,Was a bit reluctant to purchace something other than the hope product to maintain our granite countertops....should have purchaced the hopes....this does not clean...plus leaves a film...
3,Average,"I have been looking for a product that cleans well, doesn't leave a film, and generally makes the granite shine. I have a dark colored granite with flecks of red/orange throughout. The product cleans rather well, but appears to leave a slight film over the granite. I typically clean the counter tops with bleach spray first, wipe off and let dry, then apply this product. It does have a decent amount of shine, but again, leave a slight film. I am not entirely unhappy with the product, but I will keep looking for a superior product."
5,Finally my Granite is not foggy!,I have been cleaning with various countertop sprays/cleaners. We have a black granite and it shows everything. It is so gorgeous when it is clean though so I found this product and was impressed with how well it works. I wanted something that I can use daily and this is the winner. My husband was thrilled when he saw the counters. We have a large kitchen with a large island so there is a lot of granite. It did not take a ton of scrubbing with a cloth to get them shiny. So glad I found this!
4,The shine is back!,"I'm glad I followed the positive reviews on this product. I don't usually write reviews unless the product really makes me happy. Oddly enough, cleaning products and devices that are really affective make me happy! and this happens to be one of them. After cleaning my granite kitchen countertop with dish detergent (and then learning I should NOT do that), I went ahead and got this cleaner. It's very easy to us: Just clean the surface well with a damp sponge, then spray the cleaner on the granite, then wash off again with the damp sponge. I didn't have any left over residue; I think it because I used an actual dish sponge (very soft one) rather than paper towel that might leave marks. I came back in 5 minutes and noticed a shine that was not there before! very happy."
2,Granite Gold Granite Gold Daily Cleaner GG0029,"Ok cleaner. Not totally thrilled. Takes a lot of elbow grease to make it shine and then not so shiny. If you want to try it, I suggest shop around. After I purchased it, I found it elsewhere for half the price. Not worth it for the price amazon has it for.Will not purchase again!"
1,Not worth the effort,"Tried this and it leaves a film on absolute black. The best product I've forun so far is World's Best Glass Cleaner at Sam's $7.99 for 3 cans. It works great on granite, glass and many other surfaces."
5,Needed Parts for that worn out Candle Lantern.,"Very easy to install into your old Candle Lantern. These parts are handy to have around if you own one of these little lights (and you should). You never know when you will wind up needing to replace a spring or you drop or break a chain or maybe you pop the handle off and bend it. No worries if you have the refurb kit, just pull out what you need and fix things up just like new.Perfect parts for a perfect light. I keep a couple of these around just in case. Just in case I break something, and I usually do... 8^D"
2,Little unhappy,I was a little unhappy with the book. I had inherited 2 original ladyheadvases from a deceased Aunt. I couldn't find either one in the book. Iwanted more info on the collecting of the vases and the book was lackingthere too. I should have gotten another one that went into more detail.
5,Excellent Reference Guide !,"For the amateur to the experienced, this is a fabulous reference guide for all headvase collectors! Definite must-have !"
3,Great if your sitting still,I bought this for my husband. He likes listening to sports radio while he is mowing the lawn. It does not get great reception when you are moving around. It is fineif you are sitting next to a pool. so I would just suggest this if you are not planning on running around with it.
2,Great when it works,"When the Inno works it is great, receives strong signals in NYC and easy to operate. However, my commute is around 90 minutes each way and the battery has died on occasion. Once every time I switched to the mp3 player it would shut down, I had to restore it and load and set options again. Now, it works in the car, through my stereo but not head phones. I get noise like an AM radio. Hopefully it will get resolved in a timely matter."
4,Great Unit and reception is excellent,"I have had this one for 2 months and it is far better than the Delphi MyFi that it replaced. I can use this outside in the middle of Iowa and the reception is great, when in downtown Des Moines the buildings makes it spotty when walking but in the car it comes in perfect with the car kit.I have not had any battery problems, but that was a huge issue with my Delphi unit.Easy to use and excellent screen. A little pricey but that is what you get for getting the newest gadget out there.I only wish that the Inno had more onboard memory for mp3 or at least a slot for a mini sd so that I could make my own playlist.Oh well I think that this INNO is the best protable satellite radio on the market yet!"
2,Over-hyped,"Works great in the car, with great reception.Also installed it at home (and connected to home stereo); good reception.However, very disappointed with ""portability"", as reception is marginal. Bought antenna headphones, which improve reception, but seem too bulky for the size of the unit.Overall, and if portability is a big factor for you, I think the Inno is over-hyped and is not a good value for its price."
5,Really Good,"I liked my Xm Radio in my auto so i got the Inno. If you already have a xm radio then you should be under no illusion that signal is critical. I know when Im in a garage it goes away which i expected the Inno would have happen.. With the home kit I get a great signal and even walking around the edge of the house I'm ok. I lose the signal in the middle of the house. Again, I expected this. I love being able to record a song by just hitting a button and I get the whole song. This unit gives me options that I like and I'm not a slave to one online music company."
2,Greatly disappointed,"I have read many reviews of the Inno prior to my decision to purchase it. I was aware of some reception problems, but since I am in the NY Tri State area I thought it would be ok. The Inno itself is very cool - small sleek great screen and easy to use. For this I give it 2 stars. Unfortunately the reception at my home in Central NJ is awful. On my commute (bus) to NYC I could not listen to one single song with out the signal dropping out at least once and often more. Reception at home - even with the home kit was spotty and as I moved outside the signal was fine until I turned around and lost the signal completely! How is this a portable unit if that happens - especially in the Tri-State area?? The signal in NYC was excellent due to the repeaters even inside my office (my window faces south) - so if you live in NYC and will only be in NYC - I say go for it. Otherwie take a pass. I have already cancelled XM and I will return the product."
1,"So bad, I finally have to write a review","I've had XM radio in my car for about 2 years now and decided to buy this 4 months ago for in-home and outside - I've used it twice recreationally. The Inno gets TERRIBLE reception and battery life was miserable. First time I charged it up out of the box according to instructions I got 1 hour of use. Afterward during tests I was able to average about 3 hours, which isn't bad except when I compare to my 60G iPod. But battery life isn't my main gripe. If you have trees or buildings around your house/apartment you will unlikely get a signal, with or without the external antenna. I've been 99% happy with all my tech purchases (and there are lots of them) - but this one is just a bad product, so bad that I'm finally writing a review on something."
1,Mike,"I received this item and was enthused to get it. However that is where the fun stopped. If you want a unit that will work outside in a clear area, this is for you. It will also work inside with the base and large antanna, provided, if you can get it positioned correctly.It did not work anywere else for me. The transmitter will not work unless you get a car kit (not stated in add I saw). It did not work for me in wooded areas, or inside buildings or sheds.A word of caution. It cost me $20 (or so) to get it hooked up even though I canceled the next day.And be very carefull if you take advantage of the 3mth free offer. In that case you may have to pay much more to return the radio.THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I FELT THE NEED TO WRITE A REVIEW ON A PRODUCT."
3,Average,"Nice unit, works great around town little iffy driving around possibly due to antenna being inside car. Purchaced for following reasons, portable (yea lots of drawbacks) easy to download and record music (Napster good deal but hard to listen to downloaded songs on any IPOD due to apple conversion and songs protected). Internal FM xmitter useless (totally useless, purchased so i can listen to XM while working and using company cars well i am not getting 300 car kits and sure connect (EVEN WORSE IDEA)to install on our fleet cars). remote, unless you are using it to change channels while docked usless, record ok. volume will not operate while docked, so why volume what hold remote in one hand and unit in other to change volume? NOT. Not worth anything over $150. and that is going over. unit is tough, nice weight sturdy easy to read display and reception is good considering antenna. oh wait cant use external antenna unless docked, hum back to not getting 300 car kits."
1,Think about it.,"This appears to be a great product, however, I haven't had mine long enough to find out. This will be the second time I have had to send it back because of a faulty FM modulator. At ~$30.00 a trip (Electronica wants it back in 7 days and the bill to send it there is on you.) any savings you might get from ordering online, is eaten up fairly quickly.If you require an FM modulator for your vehicle, I would recommend purchasing local so that you can return it without the hassle, and price."
1,Doesn't work!!,"We have been XM radio subscribers for over 2 years, via my car, and it's great. I thought this would be the perfect gift for my husband. I purchased it at an electronics retailer (glad I did). The first night, we got great reception in the cradle, but no signal on a stand-alone basis, after all that is why I wanted it. We returned it, since XM told me it was probably a faulty unit. I received another unit the next day, and guess what, no reception out of the cradle. I returned it, and got my full cash refund. I would not recommend this unit for anyone who expects a signal on a stand alone basis. There are a lot of cheaper alternatives than this. I would think XM borders on ""false advertising""."
5,It's just great!,"I love it. Most versitile xm radio yet. I use it in my room, my car, the living room on my stereo system, at the beach on my boombox. Great for taking your worry free xm music wherever you need it.** you do need the car kit to use the FM transmitter unfortunately... However, you can just plug it into the car kit cradle and carry it like that, and the FM transmitter will still function."
1,Very Disappointed,I purchased this product and have tried it for one week the reception when I am walking is vert erratic constantly cutting in and out. I then tried to download music from Napster to find out it does not come with Napster To Go software. This will cause to spend $.99 a song to download. Not happy with the product and have returned for a refund
1,Don't waste your time or your money,"I was so looking forward to many happy hours of commercial free music on the go that I couldn't wait to buy this product. I returned it the next day. WHAT AN OVER-HYPED PIECE OF GARBAGE!!!! Forget the MP3 capabilities and the set-up of the actual unit itself- yes, its tiny, brightly lit and easily navigable, but so what!!! Why are you going to buy the Inno? Because you want a portable radio, and that friends, Pioneer simply can't deliver. If you live anywhere outside of NYC or other major metro area, FORGET ABOUT GOOD RECEPTION!!! All the previous reviews were right about that. Hopefully, XM works out the kinks in the near future, whether that means a better antenna or more satellites or repeater towers going up in every town in the USA."
2,A bit of a let-down,I'm disappointed with the product. The battery life is poor and the memory storage is too small. My biggest frustration is that it doesn't sort saved songs alphabetically.Nice feature is the ability to save a complete song from off XM from the beginning even if you start recording during the song.
1,worst value for the money you spend,I was really excited to buy the inno and figured that the installation would be a piece of cake. Well the sure connect has ruined it all. I cant use it in my convertable because of too many wires on the outside. Also they claim that the unit is fully portable which is not at all true. There is absolutely no live reception indoors. I just returned my unit and all I want is an XM without sure connect otherwise I am switching over to sirius
2,Please Read this Review,"I purchased this product because I want to listen to music while I hike. While walking around, the reception is poor, as it cuts in and out constantly. Now some of you have read other reviews stating this product is worth the money, but I honestly believe those people are paid to give a good rating to this product. It does work well in the house with the antenna, and the ability to record songs and make a play-list is fun, but in regard to that function there is also a downside. You see, XM is not commercial free radio. So, your play-lists are always intertwined with commercials, or at least the tail-end of a commercial. This product is like the fountain-of-youth -a nice dream- but nothing more. Save several hundred dollars until XM and Pioneer work out the kinks."
1,Very Disappointed,"I purchased the Inno after reading great reviews of it here and in several publications. But, unless I've got a particular bad unit, the build quality is awful. The headphone jack will not hold onto my Etymotic Research earphone plug, which pulls out constantly. No other electronic device that I have has this problem. I found posts on the Web from other people who have also had the headphone jack problem. Also, the on/off slide switch seems to be defective. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Finally, I was surprised at how spotty the reception is. I'm in the SF Bay Area, and this is my first XM experience. I expected that I would have great reception at my location. But the signal drops out constantly. I actually looked forward to getting this product, but I'm returning it."
1,Worked Great for 3 Months,Received this Inno as a gift last year. Was thrilled with it for the first 3 months and then started to have problems with turning it on once out of the docking cradle. Followed all the recommendations that came in the booklet but nothing helped. I believe that this inno came with a defective battery so called Pioneer's customer service which gave me no suggestions and offered no help. I then sent 3 snail mails to their corporate headquarters which in return received no acknowledgement. I then emailed on their web site and received no acknowledgment. I would not recommend this unit to anyone. I believe products are only as good as their customer service and Pioneer proved to me to be the worst there is.
3,"Five Stars for the Radio, One for the Battery","I have been an XM fan for years (my original boom box still gets a daily workout). The Inno itself is superb but battery life is just awful. I have tried new batteries but keep getting the same results: play time is only a couple of hours. Also, when I recharge the battery all night and take the Inno into work so that I may listen to it at lunch, the battery is dead when I turn it on! In order to maintain the previous night's charge, I must remove the battery from the radio and reinstall it when I want to listen to it! Please, whoever is going to be in charge once the merger takes place (XM or Sirius), correct this!"
4,BUY NOW TO BE REPLACED IN 2008,"At Christmas 2007 Best Buy was selling at $119 - an outstanding purchase price! I was told Pioneer was about to release a new model which will allow one to download books. Unfortunately, after 2 weeks of use the screen failed. I returned it to Best Buy and received an even exchange for a replacement. Besides the pre-mature screen failure, the only reason I did not give it 5 STARS is I am disappointed in the inconsistent signal when I use it outdoors. A slight change in direction while walking may cause loss of signal. I pre-record XM music or use my downloaded music when outside. Inside home use is excellent. It is a neat little gadget for a hundred bucks. But remember you will have to buy the XM service. Best Buy was giving 3 months free and if you purchased a year of service you received a free month, in total 4 free months for the first year. By year two I assume you will be hooked on XM Radio or it will be another dumb idea purchase."
5,wonderful device,my inno arrived on time and was wonderful for the money. I would highly recommend the purchase.
3,Portable???,"The Inno is a nice product. It is compact, lightweight and stylish. However, it does not receive a good signal in any location that we have tried using it (several cities around the country). Only when plugged into the home antenna do we get reception. That defeats the purpose of portability!!! Rather disappointing."
5,Just in time.,"Not too much to complain about here.The only significant advantage that the XMP3 has over the Inno2 Go is its capability of recording 3 or 5 differentprograms simultaneously.However,whenever I have something else to do,I am allowed the freedom of erasing all of those horrendous commercials after using Record Channel,with the Inno 2 Go,on an hour talk show-something that the XMP3 is incapable of.I already knew what the Inno 2 Go was capable of doing before I purchased it from Al and Ed's,since I bought the same product a year-and-a-half ago and now have two Inno 2 Go accounts open with XM."
3,"Nice to have portability, but hard to get reception in doors (even with the home dock)","I love my Inno when it works. I have frequent problems in my home because my apartment does not have any windows (non walled) areas which face in the direction of the satellite. As a result, I am frequently unable to listen to my programming (even when my Inno is laying still in the home dock). However, I have a second home dock at my office and the product works better there because the signal is a tad stronger. I have to admit though, I love having a product which enables me to record programming.I hope some day that the manufacturers can make this product a little more waterproof. I took mine outside once and got caught in a rain sprinkle. The result, a fried Inno that I had to replace!"
3,Best portable yet,I have a tried a few and couldn't get any signals at all. I spent a lot of time with this sitting on the shelf until I felt the energy to try and fail again.Ok . Finally hook it up. Great sound just lying in bed with the optional necessary antenna headphone. The sound goes in and out inside but to get any signal at all was exciting. I got sound outside though not continuously.My home set up is exciting. I love it and just can't decide what to listen to. I haven't figured out all the ins and outs ie: recording.I have heard the problem with Pioneer customer service. I hope this doesn't hold true cause I'd love to buy a high price pioneer HD tv. Opted for Panasonic though.I love it too. I'm high on new electronics but down on poor customer service.
3,The item falls short of the advertisement,"Admittedly I bought a used book, but the advertisement described it as ""very good"". So when I received the book and found no cover with it, I was very disappointed. Three star, that's my rating."
3,Very good but 32 pages missing,"This book is very good, easy reading but the book I got has 32 pages missing which I regret completely since is the start of the WW I (from pages 235 till 267). Therefore, check yours before reading, is very sad to find this afterwards when you are waiting time off to read this."
1,Get a life!,"This is biogrpahy at its worst. Uncritical, subjective and poorly written, the book has conveniently glossed over Churchill's many blunders in politics, his unstable personality, his sexual perversion and his character faults.The voters told Chutchill, depsite what his admiring biographers wrote, what they thought of him by giving him the boot."
3,good read but biased,I found the book to be a good read but can't help wonder what I missed about the life of Churchill. It seemed like the book gave a somewhat biased account of the life of the former Prime Minister.
4,A little dry but still very good.,"A good, solid biography although a little dull in parts, especially during the inter-war years. Something about the writing just feels a little stiff; I can't quite put my finger on it. The style is a bit dated, focusing on Churchill the politician and less on Churchill the person. I have to agree with previous critics who note the lack of objectivity; no mention is made of faults or short-comings. I read biographies, however, as much (or more) for the historical context as to learn about the particular person. Given that, I would still give this four stars despite it's serious shortcomings."
5,If only all politicians were like this!,"Martin Gilbert writes an extremely engaging biography by letting Churchill speak for himself. Extensive use of Churchill's correspondance and diaries allows Churchills wit, imagination and determination to shine through. Although the book did not mention Churchill's famous love of alcohol and is positively biased, I still enjoyed it throughly. It also seemed to capture the spirit of the times of which he lived in.The biggest revelation for me was the insight into how the British political system works and how, although Churchill is seen as a bit of a dictator, was one of the first politicians to actively seek coalition between political parties. In addition, it also seems that a man of principles can survive in Parliament and that being persuaded to change policy is not a sign of weakness. If only the politicians of today were like this!!"
1,Aging rockers have finally lost it,"This record is just awful awful awful. It seems that Sonic Youth has stopped writing songs altogether, choosing instead to do nothing but noodle and jam away, letting atmosphere take the place of bridges and verses and choruses. And the cover features a very bad drawing by Williams S. Burroughs (give me a break--just because it's Burroughs doesn't mean it's good; if Daniel Johnston blew his nose on a napkin, would they use that as the cover? Probably...), and one of the ""songs"" is just Thurston Moore reciting this super bad beatnik poetry, stuff that would have gotten him laughed off the stage at The Hip Bagel back in the '50s.No longer sonic or youthful, this band has completely lost it."
1,It's Officially Over,"Sonic Youth used to be great trendsettlers, laying the ground work for post-punk and indie rock throughout the 1980's. However, in recent years it's been all downhill. I thought ""A Thousand Leaves"" was bad, well this one takes the cake. Gone are the days of Thurston and Lee's amazing guitar playing, replaced with 10 minutes of jangling strings the anyone could do with a cheap, fake fender guitar...Avoid this album at all costs. I am just going to listen to classics like ""Sister"" and ""Daydream Nation,"" and remember what used to be."
2,bad cd about a bad city.,"new york city used to be cool, yeah. if i'd gotten this album when it came out i might be saying the same thing about sonic youth!! then i might not have looked into murray st. and sonic nurse. i, um, showed up a little late so instead of toyning me off to the band it just sort of collects dust on the shelf. oh well."
1,This album sucks!!!,"Don't get me wrong, I love Sonic Youth. I used to have dreams about meeting them and telling them how awesome they are. Now I have nightmares of having to sit with them and listen to this album. What happened? Call me a little too traditional but 10 minutes of guitar feedback is not really a song. And to fill the whole album with this ""experimental"" style is so unfair. Sonic Youth used to write great songs that were cutting edge but still listenable. Who in their right mind can sit back and listen to this whole album straight through. This album is like that whole turntablist/dj phenomenon-- it's cool when you see it live, but on a full length album at home, its just boring."
2,Rather disappointing,"It seems that with this release, Sonic Youth have run out of ideas, resulting in a dull and bland collection of ""songs"" that seem to go nowhere. The lyrics are disappointing, too, and many of the chorus tunes are kind of cheezy. Although Lee Ranaldo's contribution is among the album's best tracks, it still fails to reach the quality of his works on Washing Machine and earlier albums like Sister. But don't get me wrong--the album isn't too bad, it's just a disappointment after waiting a few years for a new Geffen release. For die-hard fans only, this record should be avoided by those just curious about what SY sound like and looking for an introduction."
2,I wish i could be nicer..,"This album does have one REALLY good song, which is the opening track, ""FREE CITY RHYMES"".. it's really excellent. and this album does have good lyrics. the song ""Side2Side"" is kind of interesting, and the title track is okay to listen to once. But mostly it's just a disc full of half-spoken poetry over uninspired music, which is disappointing. Like everyone said, thankfully MURRAY STREET and NURSE were a LOT better. but definitely check out FREE CITY RHYMES, it's actually good, i promise."
4,You fools!!!,"This is a great album. Not SY sounding, but still reallly good. For those who don't kwnow it yet, this is inspired by the post-rock movement (sounds A LOT like early June of '44, an excellent band except for their last record). Who cares this is not typical Sonic Youth?!! I find it funny when people say their best album is Dirty... Dirty is good, but the production is terribly grungy, thanx to Butch Vig."
4,newbie to sonic youth,"I should preface this review by stating that this album was my first experience with Sonic Youth. I heard it in a friend's car and was immediately absorbed in the chaotic sounds.Previously my favorite bands have been Aphex Twin, Radiohead, early Pink Floyd, and fusion-era Miles Davis. I thought this album was some of the best modern experimental music i had ever heard. I was somewhat surprised to see that even the .... review was lukewarm about this album. I would agree with the others who said that the more time you give this music the more you will appreciate it. The first time i heard it, it played games with my head. Definitely one of my favorite albums, although i still have yet to buy another SY album."
2,A pitiful release by an extraordinary artist.,"This bait-and-switch CD contains dreadful, bizarre versions (possibly demos) of some of Juice Newton's biggest hits. Skip this CD and pick up ""Greatest Hits (and more)"" and/or ""Anthology"" for the recordings played on the radio."
4,Worked for us,"We purchased this kit due to a shredded belt on our (previously unserviced in several years) HP 800PS 42"" plotter. It took most of a day to install, due to the need to disassemble and remove quite a lot to enable the belt replacement. All went well and the plotter is now back in service at considerably less cost than having a technician stop out (I did not do the replacement myself, a new person who reports to me did). The only negative I am aware of is that the included toolkit (a nice thing) did not include a smaller end torx head bit required. I resolved this obstacle by bringing in the micro precision screwdriver (including the small torx head bits) set I got from Anytime Tools here on Amazon (boXer 30 piece micro precision screwdriver set) for working on my Tivo at home (I have since ordered two more of those sets for work)."
4,Great,"My husband and I are huge fans of the Warren Miller films. When Johnny Mosley started to narrate in previous films we were like this sucks. He gets better and better every film. Although we do miss Warren so so much. Great film as always. I am from NH and ski at Okemo a lot as my season pass is good there, I really hate how they make it look like the Wobbly Barn (where the band does their gig) is at Okemo, it is really at Killington. The skit with Jason Biggs was drawn out and cheesy. I love the ski joring part, so awesome! Can't wait to see what next years film will be. Enjoy!"
1,No the old Warren Miller,"The joy of all earlier Warren Miller movies was the crusty commentary by Miller. He doesn't do it any more and in its place is a banal, high volume thumping music and stupid commentary. I would advise missing this movie."
2,Way Too Much Talking!,"As another reviewer says, Warren Miller is no longer involved in Warren Miller movies and it shows. One things you could always count on in Warren Miller films was lots and lots of great skiing action. In this one, most segments feature more talking than actual skiing! It's unfortunate because what skiing they do show looks absolutely jaw dropping in HD."
4,1080i Blu ray?,"Ah disappointing to receive this disc and to find its 1080i, although the picture is great but 1080p is what blu ray is all about?Also the cover says 5.1 True Hd but its 2 channel*** see belowGreat snow action, shame about the 1080p, but still worth the buy.edit, ive since upgraded my oppo player and this disc is 5.1 true hd, apologies, buy this movie its not the corny Warren Miller of oldit appeals to all ages and makes you keen for winter!"
1,Volume control is defective,I suppose I could have attempted to return the item but the cost and trouble of returning it would have matched the cost of the item. The volume control is defective. It is either no volume or blaring loud and nothing in between. Sometimes what you set it for at night is not the volume it goes off at in the morning. Never had this problem with any other alarm clock. Very junky item.
1,"Total ""stylish"" junk","I bought this for the same reasons as the others...cheap and cool looking. However, within one week the front ""touch censor"" snooze button stopped working. Had the same issue with the volume not working and the night and day alarm not going off at the correct time. I'm so bummed! I love the looks and that is all. Now I don't have the money to get a new one....frustrating!"
5,Another outstanding book by Coburn,"Run, don't walk, and buy every book this man wrote. He knows how to use the English language: outstanding descriptions and dialogs. Can't rave enough!"
1,A Fiction Book with very little actual history. Disappointed in the book.,"This book is almost entirely fiction and not the best of fiction novels. I did not enjoy the book, the way it jumped from time periods back and forth telling the various stories was confusing. You needed a list just to keep up with who all the players were. The blatant sexuality that is brought into the characters is in my opinion embarrassing, voyeuristic and not needed. The most interesting part comes at the very end when you think that after all the years Anne is really going to get to know that her Charlie lived and the man he became. Alas, that is where the novel ends, and it is up to your imaginations as to what happens."
2,and I like anticon,"this lp sucked. anticon makes some serious lp's but there compilations are just aweful. go check out ""Deep puddle dynamics"" or really anything produced by ""ANT"" HELL check out ""atmosphere"" but stay away from this thing.I'm sorry MN, your hometown boys failed on this attempt."
2,MORE THAN LIFE,"I love Nek's music. But ""La vida es"" try to get the old same style and to be honest starts to sound kind of tired,He looks like don't care if his voice sounds good or not. The lirycs are nonsenses,and just ""La vida es"" ""Llegas Tú"" ""Nuestro mejor Día"" and "" Celos"" worth it. I'm a little dissapointed cause his cd ""Entre Tú y yo"" is almost perfect, and this time, Nek needs try harder to make a good come back in his career."
5,I don't speak Spanish.,"You'd think I could...I took three years of it in high school. I know some of the colors, and I can say a few phrases. But nontheless, I really like this CD. I wasn't sure if I would or not. The only song I particularly enjoyed of the five you can sample is ""Llegas Tu"", which I'd heard several years ago, and is the reason I knew of this Nek fellow. Now I've only listened up to song 8 so far - which I love, by the way - but from what I've heard, it's really awesome. I highly recommend.-Steve"
3,USB Problem,"After receiveing this laptop, I upgraded it XP PRO immediately. The USB mouse did not work after patching the XP SP1. I recoverd everything and do it again. Same problem. I checked the the Toshiba Fourm and found this problem was mentioned by many Toshiba users as well. The USB problem can be fixed if you knwo how.BTW, this quality of TFT is very bad. The colors in the TFT were changed if I looked at the screen from 40 degree angle. The color is so blue.Overall, this is a very cheap computer. Don't expect it can be too much fancy."
4,Good computer except for the processor,"In general I like this computer, except for the Celeron processor. Somehow I manage to exceed 90% of the cpu usage roughly 1/3 of the time (as measured by Norton Utilities). I admit to running Origin (a scientific data analysis program) at the same time as Excel, but I've NEVER had any other computers cpu freeze up on me. If you plan on using this computer for things like Adobe Illustrator, any scientific graphing program, or just like having multiple programs open at once I'd suggest a different processor."
3,Very good features/price -- overheating probs,"I got my laptop 2 weeks ago. It has been really awesome. I used Dells and other Toshibas in the past. But I really like this one. Its very quiet and the keyboard is very smooth and nice. The display is also remarkably improved.The only gripe (and it is serious) is that it overheats a lot. Now, all the modern laptops generate enough heat to oviate the need for a room heater. But for this model, the part where your right wrist rests while typing, heats up! As a result, after working for a while, this heat gets very annoying. It doesn't burn your skin or anything, but the extra warmth irritates the skin. I complained to Toshiba about this..Other than this heating under the wrist, I LOVE THIS LAPTOP..BTW, the speakers could have been better. They call them ""stereo"" speakers but looks like they threw one of those entry-level ones..."
2,More Nevada trivia,The Nevada Trivia Book by Richard Moreno is another trivia book devoted to fascinating facts about Nevada. It differs from the Bouton book by offering more indepth answers to the trivia questions and includes substantially more historical information. I would highly recommend it for anyone interested in Nevada.
4,Good overview; great photos,"This is the latest in a long line of very good automotive-related books from author Genat. The photos are top-notch and the text informative, if a little simplistic. The overview of the early and late hemi's origins at the beginning of the book is top notch. The chapters on the many Mopar bodystyles that featured the hemi option are also quite good. My only quibble is that the book often does not show the featured cars' engines in the make and model chapters.However, if you're a Mopar enthusiast or a hemi nut, this book will ""light your fire."" Despite the minor quibbles above, it's a great book and I can heartily recommend it."
2,Robert Genat's new book 'Hemi',"This book has a lot of good information about the early Chrysler, De Soto and Dodge hemis and the later 426 hemi, but this information is available in several other books out there which have been available to the hemi lover for some time.Where I feel Mr. Genat dropped the ball is in his coverage of the new hemis. He wrote only 2 chapters on the new 5.7L hemi, and does not even mention the new Pro Stock hemi. Mr. Genat had a great opportunity to cover these two new hemi engines in this book, but instead chose to limit his coverage to the older engines."
4,TOOK ME BY TOTAL SURPRISE!!!,"And that is what a good book is supposed to do. It has been a page turner from the beginning to end. As I am familiar with Mr. Lindsay's sense of style with writing, again I was not disappointed. In the midst of the grime and grit that this story held, it also had a grasp on love -- referring to the love that Terry Parrish held onto for his grandmother. I look forward to purchasing Mr. Lindsay's next book."
2,"Why, Tony? Why?","I've been a fan of Tony Lindsay since his first book ""One Dead Preacher"" so I just had to grab this book when it came out. Well, I can't say that I totally like this book. The main character Terri is this transexual prostitute that's also a crackhead trying to make it big. If I knew that's what this book was going to be about I would not have bought it. There's alot of drama in this book but the story and plot didn't really grab me. I only finished the book to see what would become of Terri. This is Tony Lindsay's first urban street novel. I don't understand why Tony Lindsay felt the need to jump on the street ""hood"" books bandwagon. The writing he did in his first book was better than this. Please go back to your eariler writing like in ""One Dead Preacher"". There are alot of urban street novels out there, some good, some bad. This is one of the bad ones."
2,"looks nice, but it only pours half a teaspoon at a time...","I was looking for a sugar pourer like the ones you'd find at a diner. This one isn't it.It looks nice, but what the description doesn't tell you is that it only pours a half a teaspoon at a time, by design. A little tube down the middle measures the dosage, and if you want more than a half teaspoon, you've got to flip the whole thing over and fill up the little tube again.Lets say you want three teaspoons of sugar in your coffee, you'll have to flip this stupid little thing up and down six times to make a cup!Furthermore, the tube doesn't fill well if the bowl is less than half full. So often you'll get less than a half teaspoon! [...]"
1,Over-priced,"Purchased this item after using it in a hotel in Munich, Germany. I thought it was a little too high in price at first and then found the same type of item at Ikea for $31.00 less and realized it was way overpriced. As we found out, it was good for granulated white sugar, but not good for the raw sugar we use. We returned the Amazon purchase and kept the Ikea purchase."
3,gillan keeps going down,"the music is great, happy for jon, but gillan,- Blackmore was right-is not singing anymore."
2,Go Back To MACHINEHEAD!,"This is NOT Deep Purple nor was the experience I had listening to them in concert (Summer 2002) -Nashville. This is a watered- down version of one of the best bands to ever grace the planet.Dio is a great vocalist and ""smoked"" them live in Nashville. Steve Morse is a great guitarist but his bluesy rendition of the poweful rhythm guitar parts in Smoke On the Water were a joke! ... your instrumental that was a question mark for the new album was the best thing I heard that night!! ... Dio and the Scorpions were great!"
2,a reviewer from canton massachusetts,"not worth the money! just because your a fan of steve morse,dosn't mean that your also a fan of d p. here they jumped on the trendy band wagon like yngwie,kansas scorpion,etc.i paid twice the amount as the regular cd for stress fest xtra tracks only to here i xtra song,thatwasn't even written by steve.here,it's almost the same situation.the only true s m .song,is t i o a t p.how many times does he have to re-record this and play it exactly like in 1978.i wish that s m would go back to doing solo work.his music was as interessting as george lynch,satch,vai,etc.i gave this 2 stars because i like steve,but that dosn't necessarilly mean that i like orchestra music,or deep purple."
4,A Fine Merger of Two Genres,"Forget Metallica's ""S&M,"" this is the real deal, a true meeting of metal/hard rock and classical, specifically written with that purpose in mind. The first disc features songs with orchestral accompaniement, while the second has the actual symphony written by Jon Lord, along with more songs, including an incredible version of ""Smoke on the Water"" that not only has the orchestra but also Ronnie James Dio on guest vocals. Everyone is in top form here, but it is really Steve Morse who stands out, in his fluid, electric solos while dueling with the symphony."
5,Just Wonderful!,"Deep Purple is a guilty pleasure of mine for years. With the addition of Steve Morse on guitar back in 1995-95 they have never sounded better. The Concerto here is well played, and surprisingly musical. If anyone had listened to the original recording made in 1969 one would be left thinking this a rather flat piece. Yet, this version of the concerto freshly rescored is wonderful. In addition, there are selections from Jon Lord's PICTURED WITHIN album, and some wonderful songs by the group and orchestra. A lovely recording!"
4,"The song ""Wait a While"" pushes it up to four stars","There are some great moments on this album, don't get me wrong, but I have been addicted to the song ""Wait a While"" since it came out. I will often listen to it several times back to back. Sam Brown's voice is utterly compelling. The string arrangement and the piano all combine to make one of the most beautiful and heartbreaking songs I have ever heard. I have tried in vain to search for some sheet music for this song, but have yet to find any. As a vocal music teacher, I have always wanted to have the right female student come along and sing this song (with slightly modified lyrics) for a special occasion, a graduation ceremony or something like that."
2,Almost there but not quite,I wanted a replacement keyboard for the one my daughter spilled something on. I wanted another PS/2 keyboard. The one I received is a USB key board. I looked for a long time to find the PS/2 keyboard. Also they show two different keyboards in the picture. Two of the one I wanted and one of the one I received.
1,Unusabe,"Product advertised as a ""universal"" item. It WAS NOT compatible to its intended host computer."
5,Simply beatiful music in a different kind of progressive.,"Heavily borrowing from romantic classical late 1800 composers (from Berliotz to Wagner), the Enid (mostly a creature of talented Robert John Godfrey)have produced between mid 70's to the early 80's ... simply beautiful music.How to further describe it? I would not know, and frankly I do not think is necessary. Enid music is beautifull,that's all.Any of their albums is wonderfull just pick one, put it on, dim the light, close your eyes and let their music guide your dreams.I pride myself of a quite vast collection of progr music from allover the world, but I've never found anything like them. Rick Wakemann and sometimes Keith Emerson tried to blend classical music with prog rock, but neither one consistently tried to do so in all his work, like the ENID tried and in my view succeded.Give it a try."
5,perfect!,"Love this mug. Fits in the single cup coffee maker at work. Keeps coffee hot, great easy to use lid."
3,Does not cover enough of the smaller rivers and creeks.,"Does not cover enough of the smaller creeks and rivers in the area. Also, covers a river in BC. Needs more detail info. I spent two weeks up there recently and had fair success on many streams not covered in the book."
3,old news,It's pretty much outdated data with regard to where to fish. I liked the detail though. Waste water treatment is a problem with nearly all waters but has gotten so much better since the mid 90's that unless a specific warning for the specific water has been issued you are fine. Catch and release is not always necessary nor desireable.
3,"nice looking, but not for long!",I really like the look of the platter. The plastic top is a diffrent story. It broke after I used it two times. The clear plastic is surely nice as long as it holds but I would go with a glass cover the next time too.
5,Plan a leisurely project with friends,"Plan a leisurely project with friends with the aid of Between Friends, which includes craft projects meant to be shared. From onehour to allday and longterm projects, these are organized first by time frame, making it easy for friends to pick projects that lend to easy scheduling. Sample ideas: a wall clock, doll, postcard holder, or memo board."
4,cosy,There is quite a variety of projects and some are quick. I like the scissors keeper and I made many of them for friends and myself. I like pin cushions and the basket sachet will make a nice one. The pictures are charming. But I wish the patterns were full sized.
5,she's done it again!,"Charlotte Lyons has a real gift for creating something wonderful out of basic odds and ends. And her newest book, Between Friends, offers inspiration galore. Whether you have friends to share the craft projects with or simply want to escape the daily routine by making something alone this book is a fabulous resource. The instructions are very clear and the projects are cleverly organized by the amount of time they take. A great gift idea too."
2,"KInda loud, kinda slow, but it works a little bit","Well, the drive works - I'll give it that. It is extremely loud, enough so that I'd suggest looking elsewhere. I'm not sure if it was a limitation of the drive or my network, but it sure seems as though this drive was slower than other drives I've hooked up in the same scenario. Overall it was a dissapointment and didn't perform as wonderfully as expected."
2,Slow writing speed,"I have to agree with the reviewers that state that this thing has a slow writing speed. I am experiencing this as well with my unit. I suspect there is some lag time going from Firewire to USB, though the box on the Iomega clearly states that the drive operates at 7200 rpm- same as my firewire drive.... Also once you open the file window to the hard drive it takes five seconds or so for the files to actually appear. At first I was worried that they didn't copy over, but they did. Just delayed repsonse time.... I am using a 2006 PowerMac w/ 2.0 USB.I just purchased this past weekend so I unable to share any other issues with you at this time."
5,cool!,Read betwee the linesDr. merwin has stopped talking about good signs and her mother iws never getting better.
4,"Well, it's not too fair.","This book is good, but it's not really very fair on neither Sunny Winslow or Dawn Schafer. It's just that Sunny isn't right on Dawn for sneaking away to shop with Maggie. And it isn't fair on Sunny either. All I should say is that it's better to make Sunny feel that Dawn is still an excellent friend, and to make Sunny notice."
5,Ann Martin did a really good job on this one!,"Ann Martin did a really good job on this one! Sunny is a weird girl,yet cares for her mother.This is a really goood book! California Diaries make you feel like you are really there.They tell alot about friendship. If you just lost a friend,I advise you to read the diaries!"
3,It wasn't the best.,"I think this book was poorly written. It made Sunny seem selfish and stupid. She was incredibly rude to Dawn. Also, she was treating Dawn's house like her private hotel. Also, she acted terrrible to her mom. She could have been there for her mom, knowing she had cancer. Another thing is, Sunny had so many boyfriends in this 1 book and she only cared about what they looked like. Not there personality. All in all, this book was pretty good."
4,"More suited for tweens than teens, but still a helpful guide to the basics","This book compiles 100 Bible verses that are not important just to teens, but to all believers. Following every verse is a two-page explanation on how it can apply to everyday life. For instance, walking unashamed of Christ may require going against peer pressure. The commentaries are well-written, but they are very short due to the large font used. This may be good for readers with short attention spans, but I would have preferred just a bit more depth, even from a quick read.Also, I think the content is relatively simple. For teens who grew up in a religious household, there will be little new content here. I would recommend this book more for tweens or young teens, people aged from ten to fourteen. Any older and I think this book is a bit too simple. However, for young people new to the Christian religion, I could definitely see this book teaching them the basics in a straightforward, accessible manner."
1,"I agree, he's done better.","I don't understand the mediocre (and just plain bad) Frank Black albums getting 4 1/2 stars on average either. If you're new to Frank Black, I would recommend you get all the Pixies albums first of course. Then you should get the first two Frank Black albums (self-titled, Teenager of the Year), which are really really good. Other albums of his that have several to mostly quality tracks: Pistolero, Dog in the Sand, Honeycomb, Cult of Ray (yes!), the self-titled Catholics album, and Black Letter Days. The rest don't do anything for me, including this one."
4,Shine on you Crazy Pill,"I think there is something to be said for Frank on his journey vs. Frank having reached his destination. I love the earliest Frank Black albums because he is searching high and low and the range shown on those albums is amazing. In subject, form and instrumentation they're a wild ride. Now we've settled in with Frank for a drink and a smoke and I think it's true...this bar, although well loved, can seem a bit overly familiar. I like it, but sometimes I really miss Speedy Marie."
2,Put your tears away,"I really believe that Frank Black is one of the most gifted songwriters of his generation. As well as a seemingly inexhaustible ability to produce singable melodies, he has a unique lyric style and a mastery of oddball metaphor that make his writing utterly individual. And he owns THAT voice.I loved the Pixies, but I'd be the last one to hold him back from maturing in style. The Pixies are in the past, where they belong. Let him go all country if that's what he wants. After all, he's proved he can do it: `Chip Away Boy' for example, from last year's Black Letter Days, is a terrific song.No, what bothers me is that Show Me Your Tears is simply not good enough. The songs just aren't there, and musically he sounds like he's badly pastiching the genre.He's divorced, he's upset and I really hope he gets over it soon."
5,VERY GREAT MOVIES,5 STARS for this 4 movie set 2 have jim kelly one with clief.OF course there is plenty of martial arts here to watch.These are old classic movies.
3,"Don't buy this kindle book, buy Winning-the-Clutter-War instead, they are the same","Fine book, but the updated kindle version is much cheaper, and practically the same. See title.Winning the Clutter War"
5,I loved this book and I AM organized!,"I love being organized - it makes my life so much simpler. But, I raised a ""Messie."" In fact, long before Sandra Felton wrote ""The Messies Manual,"" I had dubbed my daughter ""Messie Jessie.""So, why did I buy this book? I bought 3 copies for: my daughter, and my 2 stepsons - all of whom are in their early 20's. My daughter wasn't reading hers, so I asked to borrow it because I know I don't ""know it all"" and I am always happy to learn more, new & different, or better!That's the bottom line - I learned more, new & different, and better ways of organizing! As a bonus, I learned how to help my ADHD husband while saving my own sanity in the meantime.I want to read ALL of Sandra Felton's books! I love her easy style of writing, her humor, and her interjections of faith along the way."
5,Written by a real messie for messies!,"Funny and easy to read! This book is perfect -has real advice for real messies from someone who has really been there herself!Has great, practical ideas that were useful both for me (I'm ok at organization), but also for my friend who has 18 inches of ""stuff"" over every surface of every floor, counter, couch, etc.If you want more peace in your home through less clutter and are NOT naturally organized and DO NOT like to clean -- this is the book."
4,An Excellent Introduction Into Asian Bio-Industry,"I come across this book just by pure luck. During my recent trip to Singapore, someone suggested that I should read it.Well, I have done it, and to be sure i do not regret it at all.The book provides an easy to understand introduction into the various fields of biobusiness. As someone with a non-scientific background, I really appreciate the clarity of the information given.Subsequently, Gurinder Shahi gives an excellent overview about the development of the different countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Particularly interesting are his thoughts about different cultural perceptions that have to be overcome.In conclusion, I highly recommend this book to everyone interested in BioBusiness in general as well as in Asia-Pacific developments more specifically."
4,Good for sensitive skin,I bought it for me because I have sensitive skin. It makes my skin smoother and I do not get any skin trouble. At first the aroma scent is pretty strong but it got better several days later.
5,"Only ""lotion"" for my kids","Love this cream for the whole family. Totally natural and organic. Calendula has been used for healing purposes for ages, and California Baby offers one of the least expensive calendula creams around. Great for dry skin. A good friend, who used to work in a pediatric burn unit, recommended calendula cream for my son when he suffered a chemical burn. It worked beautifully to aid in healing his skin. Very safe and effective. The only type of ""lotion"" I use for my kids."
3,Want the most for your money? Check this out,"Belle and Sebastian have been making great pop music for nearly a decade now, and some of their best work isn't on any studio album. You'll find great gems like ""Lazy Line Painter Jane"" and ""The State I Am In"" on this set, but why stop there? You could pay $18 for this box set. But there's a better option now.A new 2 disc set has surfaced, thanks to Matador. It's called PUSH BARMAN TO OPEN OLD WOUNDS, and it contains all these songs and more for a cheaper price. If you're looking for non-album tracks from Scotland's best band, I'd say the decision is a no-brainer. Buy PUSH BARMAN instead - it's the price of a single disc album, and you get 25 tracks from all EP's 1997-2001. What a deal."
5,oh my god i'm like totally from like Manhattan so i'm gona..,"write a prententious nonsensical review about how smart and intellectual i am because i'm from manhattan. oh my god it's like totally cool to be from manhattan and like go to record stores and talk with people about music because you can like only do that in like manhattan lol omg mdr wtf? anyway, the fact is belle and sebastian are a lovely band and people should check out this cd, not cuz some douche from manhattan said to, but becuz some douche from chicago said to, and i am that douche. pick it up, you won't be disappointed. so enjoy, even tho listening to belle and sebastian might make you think you are more indie rock than the next guy and super cool like the cool people in manhattan...i think they even have starbucks there..it's totally coooooool. thanks people. keep it real and have a lovely day."
3,I think I'd rather listen to Nick Drake,"Every few years another indie band comes out and becomes worshipped by the chosen few. Adulation and accolades heaped upon some obscurity by scenesters desperately looking for the next big thing. Belle and Sebastian are good. Their songs are frequently poignant and the music is quite pleasant. But they never manage to go beyond the sum of their influences (Nick Drake, Love, Donovan, etc). Rock worship trends are the passing fancies of fickle hipsters. B and S is the ""it band"" of the moment - and even more distressing they have quite a large following among the nauseatingly cutesy ""twee"" community. Ugh. Sigh. In any case, I still like them."
4,Many breathtaking moments,"Unabashed pop music, but richly so in a melancholy vein. Like a slow gin fizz. When the band's emotions get pumping, as on the track ""Lazy Line Painter Jane"", you can expect a shattering climax. Belle & Sebastian's early EP's are gathered together here impeccably, with great sound and artwork(but with teeny-tiny liner notes). It's the band performing at almost their peak(which eventually came with the ""Arab Strap"" album). Be sure to listen for the hidden track on the third disc. The lack of a female lead vocal(except on the title track)may be disappointing, but the melodies surely make up for this. Quite beautifully felt, surprisingly not redundant or repetitive(as the band became on ""Waitress"")."
3,GIVEN TIME...,"I have never been a mad fan of Belle and Sebastian. I love the albums, and I purchased this later when it was released as a set. A friend of mine let me listen to it while we were driving around one day (probably the same night we went to see Cat Power play), and I really loved what I heard. (She was playing disc 2 with the title track), and henceforth, disc two has been my favourite. The whole collection, while obvious and recognisable as Belle and Sebastian, is still different from later works and betrays a less produced and, if possible, more fun side of Belle and Sebastian. You have to love it and have it if you are a Belle and Sebastian fan."
4,Wireless Operation is a Big Plus,"I got this unit to keep track of any water leakage in the basement. The wireless operation is a big plus because I was able to set the sensor up in the basement and have the receiver unit upstairs on the first floor where I would be able to hear the beeper when it went off. Our old water alarm just had a wire hanging from it so it had to be placed within six feet of the water area and sometimes we would hear the beeper going off in the basement and sometimes not.It was easy to set up this unit and the instructions were pretty clear. I am not sure if the range of the remote pickup is as much as they claim, since my receiver had a little trouble picking up the sensor's signal and it's only about 50 feet away from the sensor (basement to first floor ...and we don't have a big house). But it seems to be working now and I like the convenience of having the beeper in the first floor area plus the uncomplicated instructions. I'm a technophobe and even I can use it!"
3,Skylink WA-318,"I chose this product for easy insulation. and being able to add extra remotes.My only dislike is that it is not loud enough. I had to put where it could be heard through out the house,and this is a compromise, I placed it just outside our bedroom. Would like newer model to be much louder."
4,Simple enough. Seems to work.,"This wireless water alert system seems to do as advertised. I have not needed it in a real water overflow condition, but it seems to signal properly when dipped in water. The sump is in the basement and I keep the receiver on the main floor. The signal is fine. The alarm is not very loud, but it seems loud enough. I also purchased a local (not wireless) alarm for the basement. The 4 out of 5 rating is to indicate that someone could make a better unit, but this one seems good for the price."
3,"NOTE: Metal *is* aluminum, NOT brass","I had the same experience as Fred: Mine arrived with aluminum rails, not brass, and in poor condition: the metal and the wood both had nicks and scuffs, plus the rails were loose...not falling off, just not solidly attached [I'm not sure if they were intended to ""float,"" but they do]. Also, mine came with an SKU sticker stuck directly on the wood and left a dark stain upon removal, and the level was not wrapped in anything.This may not matter to most...but I had intended to give this as a gift, possibly to be proudly diplayed on my friend's shop wall, and the brass was important to me.I recommended that Amazon correct the description over a month ago, but it still says ""brass""...and since both Fred & I got aluminum, it's probably a good bet they all are...hence my title.I just want to help others avoid similar disappointment."
5,"Zack, Zardoz, Zippy, and Zeke ( the Statics I know of anyway )","I saw these guys - Zardoz ( far left in the picture on the CD ), Zack ( middle ), and Zippy ( far right ) - live in 1997 at Hollywood Alley in Mesa AZ and I was definitely impressed. Great album too. Has a raw, garage punk sound. So it turns out that I recommend this album to myself since I unfortunately lost the free CD Zardoz gave to me many years ago."
3,Wow,"These were a tasty snack and packed with nutrients, I purchased them for a Christmas Gift and it made for great conversation"
4,Works great,"These shoe trees are well-constructed and work well. I bought them to keep the shape of my dress shoes when packed in my luggage. For that purpose, they work perfect. The spring mechanism fills the shoe nicely both width and length wise. Occasionally, airport security will raise a brow since they look odd in the x-ray machine but its never a big deal."
5,Woodlore Cedar shoe tree for men,"This is an excellent product. The shoe trees were sturdy, well made, fit the shoes perfectly and have held up nicely. I ordered shoe trees from another manufacturer for my husband last year and 2 sets broke within a couple of months. We are very pleased with this purchase and I am in the process of ordering 3 more sets. Excellent value, well packaged and speedy delivery."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"These shoe trees are exactly what I was looking for. Look good, smell good. Perfect."
4,There's something fishy about this sushi --- huuuarrrgh!,"The decency, compassion, humour, whimsicality, love of family, love of country, and ultra-endearing self-deprecation of George Herbert Walker Bush make this book a very gladdening read, indeed.We miss the 41st President, and wish him well.Addenda : Especial favorites among these epistles include his gracious, measured, moderate letter to Cardinal Law at the outbreak of hostilities during the Gulf War; a letter to a relative poking blunt fun at himself over his, uhm, somewhat inglorious dinner with the Japanese Prime Minister; and a letter where he recalls a lunch at his uncle's gentlemen's club, and a curious tidbit about one of the member's peculiar showering habits ...Bush 41 shows himself to be so beautifully down-to-earth and wonderfully human in these letters, that it reinforces this reviewer's regret over never having given him a vote. Alas!"
3,I'll Give Him a Chance,"After reading this book, I have changed my outlook to a more positive perception of the Bush family. Thankyou, Mr. ex-President."
1,sappy self-aggrandizement,"Horrible book from a terrible man! Why not step outside for a breath of fresh air, instead of subjecting yourself with your nose in this one. And if outside reading it, go inside and do something around the house more productive and gratifying, than reading a self-absored moribund tome to a corrupt, misguided, old man."
1,"Unlike his son, at least he can read and write","But, still, don't waste your money. If you must read this, get it from the library and buy a book here from a real American like Al Franken."
4,"Letters from George H Bush, a different type of book.","This was interesting as it is made up of letters that will jolt your memory from various time periods through out Bush#1's life.The first Desert Storm War, when Reagan was shot etc...Then this book also has insight from behind the scenes as well. I learned things that I did not know. Many were very enlightening.All in all this is very interesting.I recently listen to Clintons book as well so this is a bi-partisan review:)"
5,It's All About Heartbeat,"And you thought Ronald Reagan was the Great Communicator? Pick up this collection of letters from President Bush (version 41) and you'll be amazed - this prolific letter writer put himself at the nexus of many of this past half-century's great events through a diligent practice of correspondence with friends, leaders, benefactors and the general public. And you get the impression that he never considered it a chore.There are important lessons to be learned here. Gene Siskel was quoted once as saying ""Everything I got in life happened because I wrote a letter."" This book is a living manifesto of that principle.This book is worth every penny. At 600+ pages, it still seems too short. People used to carp at GHWB that he didn't have ""the vision thing."" But you'll see his vision clearly articulated in these letters. As he puts it in the intro, ""It's all about heartbeat."" The man has it in spades.Buy it today."
4,All The Best is the best of Bush,"A very ordinary fellow, American through & through with the love of his life at his side, his share of sorrows & joys, bad health & good, everyday life & unusual drama. This former president's collection of letters, diary entries & memos with his accompanying commentary gives us a glimpse of one of America's most private public figures. Perhaps because George Bush has preserved his privacy so very well, it is astonishing to realize that this former congressman; Ambassador to the United Nations; U.S Liaison Officer in the People's Republic of China; CIA Director; Vice-President & President has been in the hub of politics for decades & has been one of the quietest, least headlined player before the unforgiving glare of the press. The Glossary of Names reads like a Who's Who on the global scene for the second half of the last century. Absorbing, calm, humorous. Worth the read. END"
2,SJ-1 1.5 Ton Scissor Jack,Hard to work while raising. Doubt one can crank the jack at greater than one ton. I had great diffulty at about 700 lb.
1,False advertising,"I got fooled by another Johannson book that you claimed on your ""look inside"" page that it was published in 2011. When I got the book I found it had been originally published in 1985! She is an excellent writer, but in 1985 she was clearly just getting her style going, and the book was just a romance with a little danger thrown in. Her later books have much more action and mystery. I deleted this book ""Notorious"" from my wish list because I re-checked. Sure enough, you claim a 2010 pub date, when it was actually published in 1990. Shame on you!"
1,Stay away from this brand,"I bought this phone 18 months ago and can't wait to get rid of it. The handset batteries last only about an hour off the base and you have to push down HARD on the plastic keys to make them work.Further, the handsets are uncomfortable to hold and don't fit well between your head and shoulder."
2,Un ARBOL de poca sombra,"A estas alturas, el sello SURCO esta sonando mas y mas a lo mismo. Diria yo, a lo que suena el 'mainstream' gabacho. Mucho ruido, letras simples, quiero rapear, estoy molesto, etc. Si te laten los mediocres de KID ROCK, CREED u otra banda que mucho grita pero ya aburre, te latira ARBOL. Minimo las graficas de la portada estan suaves."
5,Worth it just for the Strawberry Jam!,"I am writing a blog every day about my attempt at a recipe from either Alice Waters' Vegetables book or this one, Fruits. I am terrified, intimidated and often not a success; however, I am learning so much about what to look for when shopping, what macerating is, etc. And, I am teaching myself how to make her recipes a bit easier to manage for a midwestern mom of two boys. If you're interested, or just need a laugh, go to my blog at: [...]"
1,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!,"I don't know where to begin except to say that if returning a book were easier, this one would be air borne! An amazingly low number of recipes featuring hard-to-find varities of fruits leaves me frustrated and angry. Average recipes per fruit type: 3 or 4. Pages of editorial on each fruit -- stuff you either know or don't need to --: 4. All in all, Alice Waters betrays the notion of fresh and local."
1,The worst machine ever,"My machine is a little over one year old and it crashes constantly. It has had the HD replaced, the RAM replaced and been in for repairs 3 times. This machine is a lemon. Run away fast from Toshiba products."
1,Awful Service,"Have to echo the horrible service reviews. My Toshiba notebook is on the way back to the Kentucky repair depot for the third time now (been without it for over a month now). It went in for one problem which was fixed but came back with another. Went back to have the second problem fixed came back with the same problem. And they could care less and won't even consider honoring they warranty which says ""repair or replace"". Would never buy a Toshiba anything again."
4,GOOD SHOW,"This was recorded a week before the other Ronnie Scott's offering with the same group Blanchard,Harrison,Toussaint,Mulgrew Miller. They repeat one of the songs but you get a full 70 min. of music plus a brief interview with Art at the end. Come Rain Or Come Shine is a feature for Miller while Toussaint is featured on Cole Porter's- I Love You which runs almost 14 min."
5,Inner Revelations,Belew offers a preview/review of some seriously innovative pop tunes and a few unusual and pleasing guitar pieces. What is particularily outstanding about this record is that it is a true anti-greatist hits compilation. It a rare artist indeed that has the courage to give us such a personal look at his work. This CD is top notch start to finish. high lights- live cuts from Argentina/House of Cards.
5,If you dug Homemade Blood check this one out!,"Driving rhythms, biting lyrics, Prophets unpatenable unique turn of phrase. This one's a kicker, especially the slow burners like Apology. This CD should keep Chuck's following satiated, for a while at least."
5,An other great album: it's everybody's business,"English readers Excuse me I have to do my review in Dutch to express myself better. Deze 5e cd van Chuck Prophet is als het luisteren naar een film. Veel van zijn countryrock-verleden heeft hij erop meegenomen, maar ook heeft hij a.h.w. de geschiedenis van de popmuziek verwerkt middels doowadiddies en andere muzikale effecten. Verder ook r&b en invloeden van deze tijd. De intro's zijn geweldig, de teksten weer geniaal met de nodige humor. Onovertroffen blijft zijn nasale stem in combinatie met de prachtige stem van Stephanie (Waarom horen we haar zo weinig zingen op dit album?) En vooral dat veelzijdige gitaarspel maakt deze cd TOP. Op naar de eerste live-cd.."
1,Structure lourde,"Le doyen d'une faculté est obligé de demissionner après avoir tenu des propos racistes envers ses étudiants. Il tente alors de rédiger un livre relatant son histoire puis finalement demande à un ami de la faire. Le roman se construit sur des flash-backs et on découvre peu à peu qui est ce personnage qui a 71 ans entretient une relation avec une femme de ménage illettrée de 34 ans. Sur fond de l'affaire Lewinski, ce roman est un tableau de l'Amérique avec son racisme, son passé, ses contradictions, ses maux, ses hypocrisies...Un roman qui se veut de dimension mais qui est vraiment soporifique; après 260 pages il est bien difficile de continuer malgré le désir de découvrir qui est réellement ce personnage: la structure est lourde, lourde....l'écriture également"
4,Use it for sugar!,"I agree wholeheartedly with the previous reviewer: this ""creamer"" works wonderfully for sugar. Sugar dispenses easily and smoothly from the spout, whether into a spoon or directly into your coffee/tea/whatever. It is sturdy and easy to clean. I personally do not use one for cream and so cannot comment on its function in that regard."
3,"Descriptive, witty, but ultimately hard to understand","Yes, I am all for social and political reform in America. And yes, Americans don't know anything about the environmental situation at the moment, but Wendell Berry could tell this to me in half the words."
5,A wonderful book,"Sometimes, during and after reading a particular book, I feel as though I could not have read anything more appropriate at that time.The book blows me away with its depth, its insight, or the amazing questions it raises.The Art of the Commonplace is one of those books, and it may be the best introduction to Wendell Berry a reader can ask for. As a collection of essays over more than twenty years, it covers a wide range of social issues-such as agriculture and the environment, family and marriage, consumerism, and globalism-which is amazing given that all of them relate to agrarian topics.Berry poses questions that most of us never consider, and I believe that is the main reason Berry is one of the most desperately needed Christian writers in today's America."
2,Not good at all.....,"I hope Devin changes the path he is on musically, it's getting hard to keep listening to him and he has os much talent. There are two good songs here: Bad Devil and War, other than that it's dead in the water."
1,Big Swindle,I got sucked in by the glowing reviews and purchased this book. It is a boring poorly written book. The glowing reviews must be a marketing plan by freinds of the author to create a buzz for this book. I wish that I saw the negative reviews before I wasted my money. To compare this garbage with Night Fall by Nelson DeMille is a joke. It is like comparing the NY Yankees to a local little league team.
1,Shameless Self Promotion,"Click on ""see all my reviews"" for the five star reviews and you'll see this author is using Amazon to self promote a truly horrid book. The five star reviewers reviewed only this book or a few books within the same time period to give credence to the reviews. The same is true of this review and others I have posted under other names because Amazon allows only one review under one name. But I will keep doing this until this sham stops.This is a truly awful book, save your money and don't support this self promotional use of Amazon reviews."
1,Don't believe the five star reviews,"Take a look at the ""see all my reviews"" for each reviewer before you purchase this horrid novel. You will see that they reviewed only this novel or a few books within the same time period in order to give their review credence. This book is very, very bad and I am amazed Amazon would allow this shameless self promotion. The author should be embarassed by his behavior."
5,Both of my thumbs are up.,"""The Esau Swindle"" has exposed me to a world that is so foreign, yet so sophisticated and amusing. I have enjoyed reading this novel, as it has only taken me a week to read more than three hundred pages of text. I can say, without a shadow of a doubt, that this novel piqued my interest from page one.In reading ""The Esau Swindle,"" I have learned that the truth will not always set you free. The novel tells the tale of Jacob, a prestigious art dealer, and follows his journey through Argentina to uncover clues regarding the death of his twin brother, Esau.Sex, money, and deceit cram this thriller and took me on a ride; on an experience that I have not experienced while reading a book. While other posters say that this is a novel that is destined for the big screen, I really cannot say that a film would do this text justice.With that said, I wholeheartedly give this book a five star rating."
5,The Esau Swindle -- Spine-Chilling Mystery Novel,"I too smell sour grapes from reviewers of The Esau Swindle. I believe this book lives up to its positive critiques. The Esau Swindle has exciting elements -- glamour, foreign locale suspense and the art world. Gerald Rothberg deals with his subject as a masterful author of spine-chilling mystery. Rothberg places us in a world of junta generals, corruption, assassinations and art. I vote yes, for The Esau Swindle. Yes, The Esau Swindle received some negative reviews, but only from a few who couldn't tell a good mystery from a rotten grapefruit."
5,Esau Swindle and Night Fall - 2 Great Bestseller Thrillers,"I ordered both The Esau Swindle by Gerald Rothberg and Nelson DeMille's Night Fall through Amazon at a special offer they sometimes place on their site. Esau Swindle is a fast paced and action packed thriller, filled with intrigue and glamour. Set in Buenos Aires and New York, prominent art dealer Jacob Rose seeks to discover events surrounding his twin brother's apparent suicide. With his stunning girlfriend, actress Raquel Gingold, the art dealer finds himself cornered by a cunning former junta general, seeking to locate millions hidden by Jacob's brother Esau. This book will keep you reading and turningthe page to read more. Night Fall intrigued me too. I first came to know Nelson DeMille with Plum Island and this book keeps that same fast pace. My purchase was a satisfying one."
1,followed your advice,Decided not to buy this book after reading reviews; obviously a bad book being promoted shamelessly.
1,Self-published dribble!,"I got suckered into purchasing this book through an Amazon.com review claiming that it was much better than ""The Da Vinci Code."" Don't believe it, this is a self-published book from a vanity publishing house, not a best-seller. A vanity publishing house is where an author pays to have his own book published because no respectible publisher will touch it. It is pure amature dribble. The rosy reviews, I suspect, were written by the author or friends of the author. You can not begin to compare an author who pays to have his own book published with an excellent thriller written by the likes of DeMille or Dan Brown."
1,Most of these reviews are lies...,"Welcome to the failure of Gerald's first and last novel. This book is simply awful, and Gerald has no true positive reviews of his book on this website...Click the read all my reviews button for any of Gerald Rothberg's postive reviewers and you'll find two or three other fake reviews all promoting the terrible Esau Swindle shamelessly by comparing this painful ""novel"" to real novels by John Grisam and the like. Don't believe any of these reviews, they're written by Gerald himself. I'm so sick of wasting my money on garbage like this and the lies behind it. Do yourself a favor and don't read this book."
1,Self promoted garbage,"Take a look at the ""see all my reviews"" for each reviewer before you purchase this horrid novel. You will see that they reviewed only this novel or a few books within the same time period in order to give their review credence. This book is very, very bad and I am amazed Amazon would allow this shameless self promotion."
1,Not very tasty,"I was rather disappointed in this whey powder. First, the shipping was very slow and second, the taste was not very good :("
5,Calculated Risks by Gigerenzer,"The author presents some important observations about calculatedrisks, probabilities and statistical test inferences. He makesclear the necessity to understand risks clearly at the outsetof any important decision. For instance, a physician must takeinto consideration ""false positive "" test results so thathe/she does not over-react. An over-reaction could cause thephysician to take unnecessary precautions that could do moreto endanger the patient than help. In addition, the authorcautions against fabrication of certainty or the use ofstatistics to prove a predetermined result. This book isuseful in arriving at a realistic design for a statisticaltest or any other test from which an important scientificinference will be made."
4,Oz never grows old,"I liked this book a lot. Like all Oz books, it gets to be ridiculous at times, but still a lot of fun to read. I think this book was written better than many others that Ruth had done earlier. It tended to be less absurdity, and more geared to the telling of a good Oz story. It didn't have an ending where something really weird occurred to make everything all right. I enjoyed it a lot. It is a childs book, and that fact should not be forgotten, but it is a book to make everyone feel good when they are done reading it. I personally loved it."
5,Lost King of Oz,I gave all my Oz books for a relative with grandchildren. Then I missed them and rebought them for myself on Kindle or is not available on Kindle in paperback.
1,One of the worst Oz books,"The plot addresses a very important Oz-historical question: what became of Ozma's father, the King of Oz whom Mombi disposed of for the Wizard when he took over Oz? His name, Pastoria, was mentioned in THE MARVELLOUS LAND OF OZ, but Baum did not say how the Wizard and Mombi got rid of him. Unfortunately, this book's answer is completely unsatisfying and makes no sense at all.Also, the side adventures are stupid (at one point Mombi makes her captors float away through the air by giving them baking powder), and the protagonists are too goofy to identify with.The narrative reads like a first draft.Ruth Plumly Thompson wrote some good Oz books but this is not one of them."
3,Not an experience US Army would want to remember,"Very detailed account of 2nd Phase of Chinese campaign of Korean War. A balanced account that does not demonise or find heroes only on one side. Probably too detailed except for the most avid War Historian. The general theme was that MacArthur hubris and disregard of China's concern led him to this terrible situation. The Chinese Army did very well under the circumstances of poor arms, poorly supplied and with no air force (to speak of). Unlike most other accounts, the Chinese Army came across as very disciplined, fiercely aggressive and highly motivated. The Korean issue will never be settled unless South Korea and US recognise China's concerns about US forces on its border."
4,Still relevant,"This little book was published in 2004. The Internet and the hundreds of thousands of websites on it are ever changing and fluid. Although I didn't check out all of the websites in the book, I was surprised at how many were still up and running from the ones I did!As with any book that concentrates on online resources, with time and effort you can obviously find everything the author did. This compact reference though saves you time by having done the research.A nice aspect to the book is the organization. It is organized by the basics which includes airlines, trains, buses, accommodations and more. This section is followed by themes and activities (sports, walking, health etc), a section on special accomodations (children, disabilities etc) and specialist holidays. The final section is country-by-country.Yes, some of the websites have fallen victim to the economy, but the organization of the book will allow you to add on your searches to find that perfect online booking or vacation!"
1,Poor,"When I first opened the box, I was disappointed to see that the metal corners have 'lips' on them. One lip faces into the corner, one faces out of it. This makes it impossible to use the metal corners in the middle of a large item. They can only be used at the end, so that the lip can overlap the edge of the piece.Then tried to use it for actually clamping something. The web strap is held onto the axle that gets tightened only by a thin metal clip. That clip is easy to pull off and provides very little resistance to spinning. As such, it is very difficult to get any kind of tension on the band. Sometimes if I wrap the webbing a number of times around the axle, it holds, but usually it just slips. This makes is essentially useless."
4,Better as a model than a toy,"Very nice replica but is more for display than playing with it. If you're a collector, grab it. If you're a dad looking for a gift for a 7 year old, don't."
4,Having Fun,I bought this toy for my son who is facinated by the military. He has been having hours of fun with it. Nice Quality. Good purchase.
2,high price,I bought this through amazon and found it is not worth the money I paid. It is small and looks like super market toy and not like a miniature. I wont recommend this to anybody specially at this price. When U add shipment cost it is substantially high
2,Do not order unless your a collector.,I ordered this for my son for xmas and before the day was over the propelers were broke off and the wheels. Now the body is made of metal and seems very sturdy but everything else is made of an extremely britle plastic. This would be and exelent piece for a collector but as for a toy forget it.
1,Black Hawk Down!`,Rotors fell off with it's first drop on the floor. My two year old fanatic lost it. Why are the rotors cheap plastic and all other parts durable metal? Terrible product.
3,All the Daring of the Soldier,"Women soldiers, vivandieres, nurses and so on of the Civil War. More detailed than Hall's book, but still not a really scholarly text.Various mentions of women in the American Revolution seem off-topic, with not much to show how they connect causally with the Civil War.Women spies and scouts, real women soldiers (a few, with the presumption that many were never discovered), etc.A lot of attention to contemporary literature and balladry concerning fighting women, though this work isn't deeply analyzed.For me the most valuable part of the book was a fairly long discussion of how it was that women could convincingly masquerade as men in the 1860's. This was useful and interesting. Overall, though, there was only so much this book had to offer. I wonder if the limited hard evidence for female soldiers makes any book of this kind an uphill struggle. A new volume on the topic has just come out, and I'll be having a look at that."
1,"Miserable, False Hatchet Job.","This book has nothing to do with Voltaire, it is about the author's belief that the enlightenmant is a failed project. He also unforunately seems not to understand the definition of faith, as he routinely makes the error that one finds everywhere in the politically correct west, that science is just a form of faith itself. The author should read Sam Harris' The End of Faith and should refrain from writing books in the meantime! cheers."
3,Good but uneven,I really like some of the works on this Cd but some I don't measure up to the others. This is a good CD but not a great one as it is a bit uneven.
4,Overall a good listen...,"Neil Young is one of my favorite artists and he sounds great live. This CD attempts to capture his garage/grunge sound live and does a pretty swell job. Not many of his classic hits, but good songs all the same are on the CD. If you've ever been to one of his concerts with Crazy Horse and enjoyed, I would say definitely buy this CD. For his best live performance recording, check out WELD. Incredible."
3,Horsing Around,"Neil Young & Crazy Horse have released a few live albums, with the equally brilliant Live Rust & Arc-Weld particularly standing out. On Year Of The Horse, they don't bring the intensity that make those two album so special. The performances aren't bad, they just aren't exciting. The songs just kind of run into one another and the band doesn't seemed inspired. But even in the lackluster effort, some gems can be found. ""Pocahontas"" is always great, ""Slip Away"" is a tapestry of guitars and ""Barstool Blues"" is strong."
2,DEEPLY DISAPPOINTING,"Unusually for me, I don't have a lot to say about this. Young is a genius, and the edgy but warm support of Crazy Horse has been pushing him to some of his best live work for nearly a quarter of a century. Sadly, then, I have to say that this album is dismal.In fact it's not all bad, but it's very samey, very long drawn out, the sound is muddy even by their normal earthy standards, and most of the best songs on here have been given better live treatment elsewhere.The most telling moment is when a lone heckler shouts from the audience, ""They all sound the same"". Young's response is instantaneous: ""It's all one song"". He must have proud of this quip, which comes right near the beginning, otherwise it could easily have been edited out. But it's a strange reflection on the attitude of an extraordinary genius who was once renowned for the breadth of his creative muse.Only completists and idol-worshippers need apply."
2,Disappointing,"This live album, a late 90's follow-upo to Arc/Weld, doesn't have much to offer. The choice of songs, with a few exceptions, are weak, and Young and Crazy Horse often jam endlessly, but the music goes nowhere. Buy it only from the bargain bin."
5,Lovable Grover,This Grover was loved as soon as I pulled him out of the box by my youngest daughter and she carries him around the house. Though at first she called him Ernie she finally remembered who he was as soon as I started doing impressions of his voice. He is very soft and my daughter loves to hug him constantly so he's a good value and a happy purchase.
1,Not as described online,"This plush was much larger than the description of the item. I wasn't sure what to believe, the title or the item description so ordered it hoping that it matched the description. But it was the opposite. It was a huge stuffed animal."
5,My Son is obsessed!,"I have the Gund Elmo, Cookie & Groover and my son loves! They are a good size and are nice and soft. They are a little floppy so they don't sit up on their own well which frustrates my toddler at times."
4,nice but small,"Grover is a favorite. I was a little sad by how small he was I do not think that he is indeed 14"" long. However he is so so cute! And the small size makes him easy carry around :). He is a loved and favorite toy ! only gave 4 stars because he is smaller than expected and really not much educational value but he is overall just adorable and getting much love."
3,Just OK,"I ordered this Grover--actually, two of them--for my almost 2-year-old daughter who is newly enthralled with Grover. She loves it. I don't. His eyes are nearly crossed and his mouth is crooked. He looks kind of angry--not at all like Grover. More like Oscar the Grouch! She's happy, though. So...this Grover is OK. Nothing special. And definitely not the happy, friendly guy we know and love."
4,Great CD,I am a big Ben Folds Five fan and so I did a search for them on Amazon.com and came across this CD. Not only was the Ben Folds Five song awsome but so was the whole CD. Not only that but I feel great knowing that the proceeds go to charity. Everyone will definitely enjoy this compilation of great music!
1,Bad,It is the worst album I ever bought. The songs are just terrible. Anyone who buys this album should have their head examined.
3,Not up to standard...,"I am a fan of Caty Maxwell and I was a bit disappointed with this book. It started fine, but there was little interest later in the book. I didn't warm to the main characters and there was too much jumping back and forth. In the end I was starting to root for the other guy.It is still a pleasant read, even if the ending didn't leave you feeling warm and fuzzy. I can't say I fell in love with the characters, but I am looking forward to Charlotte's book. Hopefully she will show 'em how its done!"
1,She missed with this one!,"It just wasn't that believeable that a couple could miss it that many times. It just wasn't believeable that Miranda and Alex would have made the choices they did. It just wasn't believeable, or even enjoyable."
2,Indicision,"The constant changing from Alex to the Duke on whoever at the moment was opposing her decision left my head spinning. I finished the book but would not give it my approval for a good read. Sorry Cathy, you are a great writer but this story could have been better."
3,Bit of a Volley.,"I enjoy every book I have read of Cathy Maxwell. This one gave me a little bit of a emotional toll. They're together then they're not. I believe the character Miranda was too vanerable compared to the other female characters she has written. I did feel that the chracters from Temptation of a Proper Governess has change too much since we last read it. It is nice to seee the characters agian, I felt they had too soon of a twist in characteristics.I don't believe that if Miranda and Alex did get together, it would have been such a hassel."
2,The Price of Idiocy,"I don't usually right reviews, but I need to vent about this book. The story itself wasn't half bad, but I could not stand either Miranda or Alex. Miranda was self-centered, indecisive, and moronic. Alex was equally self-centered, indecisive and moronic. One moment he's wearing his native-american collar to show he doesn't care what others think, and the next minute he's wishing he was full white to appease Miranda.As far as I'm concerned these two suck and they probably deserve each other. I hope Charlotte and the Duke are not as thoroughly unlikeable in their story."
4,An Adventurous Collection,"This is an enjoyable collection of Mark Jenkins' articles for various outdoor magazines. Jenkins shows an often morbid tilt to his writing and covers his death-defying adventures in many different types of extreme sports. The best articles here include ""Hitching"" about the lost art of hitch-hiking, ""Ego Trip"" about how an adventurer can make stupid decisions even if the quest is successful, and ""From the Mouths of Babes"" concerning the pursuit of extreme outdoor sports with little kids. Also enjoyable are Jenkins' tales of his dozens of severe injuries and his exploits with his equally danger-prone father and brothers. This collection is a little thin but it's quite an enjoyable look into the heart of adventure and why people do it."
3,I was expecting better,"This plunge base contain all the basic feature expected.It offers 4 adjustable depth settings which allows you to route in multiple passes very easily.There is a dust collector attachement but it did prove somehwat inefficiant when attached to my shop vac.The knobs that let you adjust the depth settings as well as the lock lever are all made of plastic that doesn't seem to be designed to last forever.Finally, the plunge mechanism is not as smooth in use as what I have experienced with some competitors router.If you already own the router and are planning to buy the plunge base separatly as I did I would suggest considering buying a seperate dedicated router for plunge operations with a smoother plunge mechanism."
4,Huge improvement over the 690 plunge base,"This is the DeWalt 618 plunge base machined for the P-C 890 motor. It's a huge improvement over the 690 plunge base and I've heard to earlier 890 series plunge bases weren't much better. This is a smooooth plunger, no sticking or slop, The spring strength is just right; strong enough to lift the motor but not so strong as to be difficult to plunge. The depth stops are okay and the dust collection is really pretty good, especially doing rabbets and cuts where the bit is covered by the base. Dust collection works with edge works but not as well."
4,Now they have it right!!,"Anybody who owns an 890 series Porter-Cable router knows the original plunge base was a disgrace. The Company SHOULD have GIVEN us this replacement but I broke down and bought this one. Believe me, it makes the 890 a whole new router!!Mine is smooth and well designed. Swallow your anger at Porter-Cable and buy this plunge base. Toss the original in the dump....where it belongs."
2,Boring GIS,Only get this book if your class requires it. It was among the most boring text books I have ever been forced to read. As far as the content it is to vague to make it really useful.
3,"Heavy going, get Geographic Information Analysis.","This book is dry but thorough. A good grasp of maths is handy when reading. They go through the basics, which are still relevant to GIS, so don't worry that it's more than 10 years old now. If you want something more accessible though, and something which can sometimes be fun (and isn't written with a fear of not upholding the reputation of oxford), get 'geographic information analysis' by o'sullivan and unwin (2003)."
1,Crap,"Davidson, Andersen, and Rouse were sounded so much better when they were Vendetta Red. Davidson's voice is still top notch though, and Andersen's guitar playing still blows me away. But the music they have made as Sirens Sister is crap."
5,8 note hand bells,"These bells can be enjoyed by both children and adults. We have used them with songs which span only one octave or less, but they could be used for chords of any song in C major. Children should be cautioned not to pull at the clapper; otherwise the bells are very durable."
5,handbells are great,I bought these handbells to use with a group of older adults with dementia. They had a great time playing along with some simple Christmas songs. We used the numbers on the bells instead of the colors and everyone could follow along. Great fun! The only negative is that we had to sound out the songs ahead of time to make our number chart but it was fairly easy.
5,Space opera at its best,"""Skylark of Valeron"" is another book in the Skylark series. Doc Smith writes space opera at its best.There is all sorts of edge-of-the-seat adventure in this story, including a detour through the fourth dimension! Fans of action will not be let down!Now, the story was written more than 70 years ago. So, the language and the way people interact is dated. Politically correct people may object. However, the fun and adventure overpower all those considerations.Have fun! Read a different sort of adventure!"
4,Hardships of the Chinese,The book was about the hardships endured by the Chinese people which is something I hadn't known about before. It also had a moving story about the characters in the book
5,One of the best books on Aikido.,"I have spent a great deal of time reading books and articals on Aikido. None have given me the insight that this book has.. If you injoy this art and are looking for a deeper under standing of Aikido, you will find it here."
5,Best Book of Greek Cookery,"Greece in Print the supplier of this book were fantastic to deal with, delivery arrived two weeks before it was due. Best Greek cook book ever written. The receipes are easy to follow, guarantee to find all ingredients. It has inspired be to be a better cook."
5,greek cookery book,"great recipes, just like yaya's village cooking. tends to fall apart from over use. i have bought one for each of my daughters and my sister."
5,Great Deal,"Great Deal, I researched for a good 2 hours and ended up with this unit. Very happy with it!"
5,Awesome,"Wow! What a great product at this price. I have purchased similar but far inferior quality products for three times the cost of this one ($38.00). If you are installing cameras, this is an absolute necessity. It powers your cameras and provides a nice locking cabinet to terminate your wiring. Just excellent!"
1,Beware! Older edition of the book!!!,"I bought this for my daughter for a class because Amazon had it linked to the hardcover of the same name. Small problem, THEY ARE NOT THE SAME BOOK. Only the first few chapters are the same. CHECK THE EDITION NUMBER AND PUBLICATION DATE your professor wants before you buy this older edition of the book."
3,"Pretty good, not great","A couple great songs, and a couple poor songs. I didnt like it that much, but many people do like it. Eligh and The Grouch both seem to come correct lyrically, but some of the beats sound lazy. I dont know what else to say about it, you might want to sample it before you buy it."
5,Pantera + Live = ADRENALINE RUSH!,"Okay, so by now, we're all familiar with the studio, Pantera, right? Well, tough guy, you think you can handle Pantera - LIVE?How does Pantera sound live? One word: EXPLOSIVE! The Texans explode on stage with their energetic, crushing, mosh-pit-inducing METAL, giving all their fans a huge treat. On this album, it really feels like you're there... the crowd going nuts, Phil's banter with the crowd, and, of course, there's always the energy of a live show... and this is Pantera. Need I continue?The two studio tracks, ""Where You Come From"" and ""I Can't Hide"", only justify the purchase further. Crank up the latter and enjoy the hubbub from the neighbors!Official Live: 101 Proof is packed to the brim with ADRENALINE, enough so to wake the dead. Even the biggest stick in the mud will yell along with Phil, ""THE TREND IS DEEEEAAAAADD!!!!!!!!"" This one is essential. Pick it up and forget all that Los Ketchup nonsense."
5,a+,A+ great awesome stupendous... Filling in more words for the review so I can review more reviews and done now.
3,more like 3 1/2 stars or so......,"From a band that produced such classics as Cowboys from Hell, and Vulgar Display of Power, one would certainly expect them to be much tighter live than they are on this disc. Phil's vocals are bloody *** awful on this album, although they were never great to begin with. Dime's guitar is thin, and in places is a bit sloppy. Though they sound good on classics like ""This Love"" and ""Hollow"", they sound half-*** on material like ""Cemetary Gates"". The Trendkill material never should have seen the light of day, much less been played live. The new tracks, however, are a hell of a lot better than anything on Trendkill. All in all a good live album, but I expected a little more."
4,PanterA... rock!,"This album... is one of tha best live albums ive ever heard.the new tracks our sweet 2, this album is an absolute must for anyoneclaimimg to be a hardcore fan."
3,For the serious Pantera fan.,"The live performances are full of Phil's ridiculous and belligerent rants and ramblings. Musically, it's your standard Pantera awesomeness without the studio polishing. It's impressive to hear Dimebag pull off his solos without the numerous layers and overdubs that always seem to get mixed in. The two studio tracks are good, but I would probably just get them off iTunes or something if I wasn't a serious Pantera fan."
4,Pantera Live,"A good live-album by the texas cowboys. Some of the classics are there but also some newer songs who are fillers on the albums which they come from. The sound isn't bad but there are definitely live recordings with a much better sound(like the Live Era disc-set from Guns N Roses). Despite these negative aspects the album demonstrates what a brutal live force Pantera were and this alone is worth the price of the cd. Metalheads who just started listening to Phil,Dime and co. should check out other efforts of the band before, because this record is mostly for the die hard-Pantera fans."
4,A Decent Live Showcase,"If you haven't gotten to a Pantera concert, this is pretty close. In some respects better cause you can hear everything more clear and not so distorted. The long speech Phil gives before one of the songs is kinda redundant so fast forward through that and Sandblasted Skin and Suicide Note2. Those two songs SUCKED on Trendkill and they're worse live. The two new studio songs are a breath of fresh air from the Trendkill album. I really like both songs a lot and I pray that their next album works as well as these two new songs do."
5,Best CD of the Millenium,"The fact that this album was recorded live in Moscow, in front of what could easily amount to a million screaming, puking, fighting fans, simply adds to the feel that Pantera has developed for themselves and put indellably on this record. The five stars rating says it all: this is definately a well made vulgar display of power which couldn't possibly be a letdown for any established fan. I Would not, however, recommend buying it as your first Pantera album because any that you buy in following lifetimes will be a severe dissapointment."
4,Africa the First Time,pretty simple book. had some helpful info. some good hints. after actually going to Africa I would have included some more info that I think would have made it better.
3,Dull,"I bought these earrings as a gift and will not be giving them as a gift. They are dull, the tiger eye gem doesn't have the different hues of brown like the picture. I was dissappointed."
4,Positive,"I bought these earrings for my wife (per her specifications: brown, dangel, and square). She was happy and pleased with them. I'm happy and please because she is. Isn't life grand."
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"I watched the Canadian History Channel's presentation of Deadwood last fall and became an instant fan. When my wife presented me with a copy of the 1986 novel I was immediately suspicious that this would be western pulp with no basis in history. Boy was I wrong! This novel could be sub-titled ""The Charlie Utter Story"". Charlie's colorful career is the vessel that carries you through this wonderful period of history; a history that's filled with comedy, tragedy, and always fascinating characters. Al Swearingen turns out to be somewhat more liberal in his sexual tastes than his HBO namesake. Handsome Dick, Bill's wife Agnes, Captain Jack, Pink Buford, the Bottle Fiend, the China Doll, the vile Boone May, and Sol Star's involvement in the great Deadwood fire could provide the basis for many new seasons of the HBO show.Pete Dexter is a genius who has taken American histoy and turned it into one of the most entertaining books that I've read in the past year."
4,Beautifully Written,"I have read a few of Pete Dexter's books and after having watched HBO's version of ""Deadwood,"" wanted to give this book a try. Let me make this perfectly clear: I do not like westerns as a genre, in film or in prose.This book strays from HBO's interpretation (or vice versa) so please go into reading this with an open mind. There will be differences if you are familiar with the HBO series. The book is a standout for several reasons, but for brevity's sake I'll keep it...brief. The story telling and language are vivid. The humor is somewhat different and did have me laughing inappropriately-loud in public places. Most importantly, the book and its characters convey complex emotions and ideas with relatively simple language -- a characteristic unique amongst any previous books that I have read. A solid buy."
3,interesting,I started the book and had trouble with the context of the wild west and the characters in the beginning. I began to be swept up by the words of the author somewhere around page 60 and I was a bystander talking and listening to the characters in the book. Dexter's development of characters is very rich and knitting of paralell storylines is extrordinary. I enjoyed it immensely! Especially the conversations between the Bottle Fiend and Charlie.
4,A different approach to economics,As a atudent of economics. I have to admit that this book has a unique style. Also as a course book. t has so many things to give. (One of our professors uses this book in his courses.)
5,Great paper great deal,great for what I need taking picture works good for background would buy again lots of cool colors nice and thick
3,"Dave, Don't Grow Up!","Why do some rockers feel compelled to grow up? Mr.Byrne was amongst the best rock 'n' roll artists ever, but for some reason can't help going to ""legit"" classical and soundtrack stuff. Now don't get me wrong, I can listen to YoYo Mama all night long, given the right mood. But when I buy ol' DB, I expect to have my bee-hind kicked a bit. Not here. OK, I'll admit it's very well orchestrated and performed. But c'mon Dave. Let's strap on the electric guitar and blast those trademark vocals. You'll keep us all young in the process."
5,American Shoes,"American shoes by Motorace is a classic rock song, with strong drum beats, catchy guitar and great lyrics. Their sound is great, with distinct 'Oasis' influence. Make sure to check this out!"
1,GARBAGE,"Does NOT keep good time, evidently owing to poor quality. Even after installation of a brand new battery by me, the watch is not accurate. DO NOT BUY."
4,All in all a pleasant read,"For those who enjoy the rhythms of JB's prose this is a nice sequence to the Iris books - and Iris pops in and out of this one too. This is his widower's house (not houses). Interestingly, this book has a bit of a plot to it. Less memories fade in and out so we hear less about JB's past life and spend more on the memoir's present. Rare occasions bring thoughts about Iris. There are interesting quotes to spice up the lot as in: ""When men chose not to believe in God, they do not thereafter believe in nothing. They then become capable of believing in anything."" -- G.K. ChestertonAll in all a pleasant read."
4,3.5 years and still going strong!,"I received this coffee maker as a wedding present 3.5 years as of November 2000, and it is still functioning perfectly. The timer is a great feature that will allow you to wake up with a hot cup of coffee, or have it waiting for you when dessert time rolls around. The look is sleek and nice. The coffee is...well, coffeeish. But the very best part is that you can start pouring your first cup before it is done brewing...it's got a little valve that stops the coffee from pouring onto the hotplate and making a mess. Now that's worth the price of admission, my friend! I gave it four stars because the construction is a little flimsy, but rest assured because Krups really stands behind their products. And like I said, she's still going strong!"
4,Good Value,"I bought this coffee maker as a replacement for a $200 Delonghi and like it at least as much as my old one. The timer is simple to use and is reliable, and I like the water level gauge on the side. My only complaint is that I always spill a little bit of coffee on the burner when the pot is full. This could be rectified if the pot were a little taller. Since I know that it will spill, I'm getting better a finagling the pot off the burner without tipping it. It's a small but annoying problem. Otherwise I am totally satisfied with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable, straight forward coffee maker."
2,A little dissapointed,"I had a Krups for 5 years, until it finally crapped out. Of course that particular model has been discontinued long ago. So, after checking out every model, I went with the 212-42. The ""comparison"" chart on Amazon.com indicated it had a stainless filter. Wrong, and disappointing, same old paper filters. Now we'll see how it stands up to the time test."
2,don't get it!,"I was shopping for a new coffee maker when I happened upon this one - the one I am replacing. It still works, but I am tired and embarrassed from mopping up the coffee that spills from the poorly designed carafe every time I pour a cup of coffee. My model doesn't have a timer, but the rest is the same. Once we made coffee without putting the carafe in, and it kept brewing until it came out of the top. I gave it two stars because it didn't break after that."
2,no coffee on saturday morning!!,"We purchased this coffee maker with the confidence that the Krups name was worth the extra money. Our coffee maker lasted about a year and a half and then it died. No symptoms, it just would not turn on. There was nothing we could do except to be dissapointed. A fairly expensive coffee maker like this one should give you more mornings of hot coffee. Also, the decanter dripped when it poured. Everytime, even using caution, you dripped."
2,Katie,We bought this after our Krups of many years saw it last brew. We were very happy with our first one (with timer & clock) and couldn't buy the exact same so tried this one. We are extremely disappointed in it. The overall quality seems far less and the timer feature broke (it brews the coffee as timed; however does not stay on after brewing). The coffee doesn't seem to taste as good as it did in the first one either. Would NOT recommend this coffeemaker.
5,Great Stands!,These stands are great. Like most reviewers said they are not height adjustable but seem to be set at the perfect height. They are very sturdy and well made so you do not have to worry about them tipping over (unless of course you have a 3 year old who likes to pull on things). Using these with the Polk Audio RM6750 speaker set.
3,Mary Timony's first solo CD,"Mary Timony's first solo work on the Matador label following Helium is an ""unplugged"" but non-the-less interesting CD combining acoustic guitar, piano, synthesizer, violin, drums, and cool songs. For an alt-punk-rocker, she must have had a little classical music in her background."
2,Optics is ok but low quality control in production,"Right out of the box, It seem to be good quality for the price. But When I try to view through it. It is bright and sharp enough but I can see a few specs of dust. Upon close inspection, I saw a few dust under the big lens and also one big dust under the eye piece. It has such a poor quality control on this binoculars. I don't know it is only the one that I have or not but I do not want to get any of these anymore."
5,Absolutely Genuine,"I truly hated the thought of having to put this book down while I was reading. The writing is so real and genuine. Some chapters had my eyes well up with tears while others had me smiling and chuckling. Whether or not you have experienced the death of a close family member, anyone who is part of a family will be able to make connections and understand the language of relationships, as well as the role we each play within. This book is a testimony that the human heart ""breaks""--sometimes again, and again, and again--but it also can, and will, heal."
4,Very Good Acoustic Set,"If you're unfamiliar, the Bridge School Concerts are an annual event set up by Neil Young to help pay for the non-profit Bridge School, that helps children with severe speech & physical impairments. Big stars play very simple acoustic sets. This one is very, very good.The set list is:1. I Am a Child - Neil Young 3:172. Shadow of a Doubt (A Complex Kid) - Tom Petty 4:473. All That You Have Is Your Soul - Tracy Chapman 5:334. Sense of Purpose - The Pretenders & Duke String Quartet 3:075. It's All in Your Mind - Beck 2:466. The Road's My Middle Name - Bonnie Raitt 4:107. Yes It Is - Don Henley 2:458. Friend of the Devil - Ministry 2:559. America - Simon & Garfunkel 3:4010. Heroes - David Bowie 6:3411. Nothingman - Pearl Jam 4:3512. Battle of Evermore - Lovemongers (Heart) 5:4113. Believe - Nils Lofgren 3:1714. Alison - Elvis Costello 3:1915. People Have the Power - Patti Smith 5:37Pick it up, enjoy some tunes, help some kids!"
4,Stunning Line-Up,"The nice thing about this is: it's live and acoustic. Forgetting about the huge mega charity concert events like Live Aid for a moment which are often more hype and spectacle - this grassroots album is a heartfelt reminder of what music is about. The result is a really nice collection which gels together seamlessly from track to track, but assembles some great music.What I'd really like to know is how they got such a stunning line up of singers to perform for the school benefit! Neil Young, Elvis Costello, Bowie, Pearl Jam, etc. A eclectic ensemble but one that sings in unison. Couldn't be better. Get it and support the Bridge School!"
4,the bridge school concerts,"I enjoyed the c.d.and the great artist that took the time for such a great cause like the Bridge. I enjoy Neil Young`s music and am a great fan. My Heart goe`s out to Neil,Pegi and family for all the hard work to help all these gifted children. Will look forward to the next Bridge Concert. J.C. Milwaukee [P.S. Does Neil ever take a rest? Take care Neil."
3,Hella H4 Headlights,"I was expecting a brighter light beam and sharper pattern. Beam and pattern compare with over the counter and less expensive halogen sealed beam bulbs. I like the look of the flat lens, but it is at a premium price."
4,Good on Triumph Bonneville,"This headlamp is good on my Bonneville, it's a direct and easy installation. My stock headlamp got cracked so this was a required repair and not simply a performance upgrade; that said, it focuses the light pretty well and is definitely better than the stock headlamp. While it doesn't appear as bright as some of the higher-end headlamp setups I've seen on the same bike with the same bulb, it's very cost-effective.Note that my headlamp arrived with a standard 60/55 H4 bulb and NOT the 100/60 mentioned elsewhere with this product. This was a disappointment, but USDOT doesn't allow us to have higher than 60/55 so I'm guessing that's why we're getting the lower-wattage bulb here."
5,"Villeroy and Boch Audun Ferme, Chasse, Fleur","After having the same dinnerware for 18 years, I chose to replace it with the Villeroy and Boch Audun Ferme plates, Fleur salad plates, and Chasse soup dishes. What an amazingly attractive setting this is! Too, I have accidentally hit a few pieces on the cupboard shelf while putting them away, and they didn't chip or crack. This set is worth every penny!"
5,Vegan Natural Choice,"Vegan. All natural. I am not ethnically Indian, but I lived in India for several years. This snack mix is quite spicy like it should be, not bland or Americanized. Very high quality and not too much vegetable oil, just right. A large size version of the snack packets available everywhere in India. Amazing to be able to buy the ""real thing"" in America from Amazon. This review is out there for those for whom this makes a difference. See all of my reviews for more great choices. Check out ""Vegan Grocery Favorites"" and ""Vegan Grocery Top Ten"" in Listmania. Your ""helpful"" votes count and will be greatly appreciated to benefit the search of others. Thank you."
5,GREAT MUSIC,"THIS CD IS ONE OF THE BEST I'VE HEARD IN A LONG TIME. I'VE ALSO HEARD ERIC'S NEW BAND, ""LIGHTNING HAND""----PRETTY SWEET STUFF---JARED"
4,Departed-Very good tunes!!!,"Soundtrack is very good !!! But should not have left out -""Gimme Shelter""-Rolling Stones. Too bad. But otherwise worth playing!!!"
2,missing song,"The strongest song of the whole film, without a doubt, is the Rolling Stones' ""Gimme Shelter"". Of course, the soundtrack doesn't include it."
3,we need more!,"There is so much music in this film, they shouldve made two soundtracks! well well well was perfect in the movie and its not on the album!:("
3,Seriously offensive review!,"Sorry what? ""Thankfully, LaVern Baker and Patsy Cline help offset a very white, very male, very classic-rock selection.""Wow.. this is from the PROFESSIONAL review for this album? So the soundtrack to a movie is being criticized for being ""very white"", ""very male""?! I bet such a review wouldn't be ok if it had some negative overtones about minorities or women!I would expect some comment like this from some unmoderated random post, but such tripe from an official review is offensive!"
4,"""The Beach Boys' obscure 1972 song ""Sail On, Sailor""...EXCUSE me???","Note to Amazon Editorial Reviewer Elisabeth Vincentelli: ""Sail On Sailor"" is a lot of things, and ""obscure"" isn't one of them. It's widely regarded as the final burst of brilliance (within the Beach Boys framework) from Brian Wilson, the final ""classic"" song from the lineup including Carl and Dennis Wilson, Brian as a composer, Al Jardine and Mike Love. It was sung by Blondie Chaplin, who...along with Ricky Fataar...was with the band for three albums (Carl & The Passions So Tough, Holland, In Concert). Explain to me how a Beach Boys song that is not sung by Brian constitutes a ""slight twist?"""
4,Mostly grand,Lots of low profile classics and a few big names as well. There's a leaning to some great and unique guitar work in much of it. Its the track to the movie so there's no comment about some of the selections but you wont be disappointed.
5,"Departed soundtrack, exciting as movie","Loved it. The songs are crisp and clear, and fun. Played it for people who had not seen the movie, and they loved it. Very, very pleased. Love the Irish music, so typical of Boston."
3,Missing Songs!,"Missing some very important music. 1st, The Rolling Stones' Gimme Shelter. 2nd, John Lennon. Especially since Jack Nicholson directly quotes John Lennon in the film."
5,The Departed Review,Loved the movie. It was even better the second time on DVD. It may me go to Amazon to buy the movie sound track.
3,nice - but not more,"by looking after one track this cd is ok, but not more. So, for me it were better without it..."
4,Best gangster movie soundtrack,"Martin Scorcese always finds great music for his movies, particularly gangster movies. It's close but I would rate this soundtrack slightly better than GoodFellas because of the diversity of music. Patsy Cline, Beach Boys, Badfinger, and many others. The music seemed to fit each segment of the movie just right. Amazing how someone can equally see a vision for a movie, then break it down into scenes, and then have music that is perfect for a particular scene. Lots of talented people in this world. Buy it and you won't be disappointed. I only rated it a 4 because I wished there had been more music."
4,The Departed,"The soundtrack for the movie was so wonderful I knew I wanted it for my collection. Although the CD does not contain all the songs in the film, there are enough to make this one of a kind collection worth having."
5,Buy this cd,"A simple review that can be summed up as ""buy this cd"". Loved it from start to finish. You won't be disappointed."
4,The Departed Soundtrack,"Loved the movie so much that I bought the soundtrack. But not before a clerk in a store that DIDN'T have the soundtrack told me that I ought to skip the soundtrack for the Dropkick Murphys and somebody Molly--""They're most of the music anyway,"" he told me. Well, Dropkick Murphys are screamers and can only be endured for a brief while, not a whole album. The whatever Mollys are... uninspired. I got the soundtrack and like it fine. Somehow, after all the screaming, though, I'm exhausted."
4,The perfect toilet topper,"Featuring 60 household items, from lipstick to dental floss to diapers, Holman Wang takes the reader on a remarkable trip through our bathroom. Although we spend a significant amount of our lives in the bathroom, most of us are quite unfamiliar with the history of daily items like perfume and razors. Bathroom Stuff shows the history of all the bathroom stuff we use daily and adds a load of remarkable facts and trivia.Each item is concisely covered on two pages and is accompanied by a set of originals photographs. It all looks very stylish and enjoyable. One criticism would be that certain items have clearly a lot more things to dwell on, which was not possible due to the very strict format of the book. It would certainly not have hurt to extend the book by another 100 pages.But all in all it stays an enjoyable book to take with you when you visit that smallest place in the house: the toilet (also described in Bathroom Stuff)."
5,SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO COOL,what a nifty book! Never knew there was so much history lying around my bathroom!
5,perfect,I would definitly recommend if yor rebuilding a motor it has lots of good imformation for the do it youre self person
5,"WOW, What a mind chilling story!!","I loved this book so I'm rewriting a short review, since I already wrote one 3 weeks ago but it disappeared--I suppose--but that just falls in line with this strange and wierd but terrific story. This is a trip through a young teenaged girl's mind with all of her wierdness. This book will keep you turning pages and believe me, the ending is soooo surprising. This author has a magnificent imagination. I can not wait for the next book to come out. Read this book and join these young girls' pajama party....you won't forget it!! Keith Carr, the father, as well as the wicked grandmother are a bit on the strange side also."
2,More decorative than useful,"This colander looks good on any shelf or in any cupboard. It is made of high quality materials.The problem is with the pattern. It takes up too much space that should have holes in it. That causes the food to not drain well, so it ends up squishy and soggy."
3,Need help with this product!!!,"This is an absolutely beautiful teapot, but it comes with a completely worthless instruction booklet. I wrote an email to customer service at the WMF web site, but didn't receive a reply. Grrrr!I need to know if this is safe to use to heat the water on the stove, or if the boiling water must be heated in a separate kettle!! Can anyone who has this please write a review to include the answer to this question? I don't want to ruin it!"
3,Not quite the best of,"If you're interested in more rare tracks like ""Hard Times"", you'll like this cd. But if you want the hits ""Don't you want me"" and ""Fascination"", you won't find them here."
2,Insincere,"The author poses as an unbiased investigator, but her agenda is to debunk the Messianic movement. There is no reason to believe the one congregation she choses to study is representative of Jewish believers. She depicts Messianic Jews as clinging to their Jewishness illegitimately. An entertaining and somewhat suspenseful read nevertheless, as one anticipates the author's erroneous assumptions to soften in response to the gospel. Don't hold your breath."
1,But alas- is this why Recontructionism may be too unJewish :(,While this recontructionist 'rabbi' seeks to make Jews Jesus/Yeshua/Yahska/Whatever believers I suggest the followingV'Da Mah SheTashiv: Know What To Answer (To Missionaries) A Thorough Jewish response To Missionaries
3,Too small for StorkCraft Stage crib,"It looks like a good mattress (our baby is still on her way, so we haven't used it yet). Feels firm and well constructed. However, it doesn't fit our Stork Craft Stage Crib, Lenox... about an inch too small, both length and width.Here's my advice. If you are not sure about the fit of a mattress after purchase, test it with your crib WITHOUT OPENING THE PLASTIC BAG. We opened the bag, so the Babies'R'Us store we purchased from does not take it back. Now, we have to look for a filler...."
1,No wonder it doesn't fit my crib!,I have recently discovered that it does not fit my crib. I have the Simmons Ventian crib and there is a 2-inch gap between the foot of the mattress and the foot of the crib - just enough space for my daughter's foot to slip through. We called Simmons to see if we had assembled the crib incorrectly and they told my husband that we had to buy a new mattress that fit the crib! I will be returning this mattress to BRU ASAP! Simmons does not get any points from me!
3,Child,The CD is enjoyable. The condition was poor. It has a scratch which causes skipping. I bought the CD for a particular song which is OK.
3,Bel Ami novel,"Bel Ami was a pretty good book but I was little let down with the ending. It just seemed to drop off unless there is a sequel in the works?? I, like every other Robert Pattinson fan, am anxiously awaiting the movie opening up in our local theaters."
3,review of Bel Ami (Penguin classic),"I wanted to read this book so that I understood the story before the movie was released. The book gives a very clear understanding of the main character, Georges Duroy. With all other characters, we can only see their connection with Georges, but there is no other real understanding of their viewpoint. The book is only about Georges Duroy, and the people who come in and out of his life. Good story, really enjoyed it."
1,Kindle version is in French,"I guess it does say French edition, but why is it mixed in with all these translations. Now I'm stuck with a book written in French that I cannot read."
3,Stocking stuffer,"I purchased this for my husband as a stocking stuffer. It was larger than expected, and the base is kind of cheap-looking. The item itself is fine, but I was very disappointed that the white uniform had been badly yellowed by the container. In the photo here, it appears the front of the container is a clear cellophane (or plastic), but in reality it is very dark yellow, and appears to have somehow stained the white uniform of the piece. I was very disappointed, though hubby displayed it in his man-cave anyway. It should be packaged differently."
3,Small and very focused,"The book is small, and covers only the lead up to this epic battle and the battle itself. No real mention of the subsequent Rorke's Drift battle or who escaped from the one only to fight in the other. I suspect this was saved for another book. Lots of low-qual pictures but they do convey the story fairly well. Not a bad book but a bit pricey for what you get."
2,Didn't work for me,I was excited to hear about this product a friend of mine told me how great it was. It didn't do anything for me. It peeled off my nails the day after I put it on every time. It didn't make my nails stronger and a complete waste of money.Also it is hard to find other then on Amazon.
5,Only Nail Product that has worked for me!,I love this product. My nails are weak and split all the time. This product really comes through. I won't use anything else.
4,Indestructable!,"I have a lab puppy, and for any of you who have read my other reviews, I LOVE idestructable toys, as my puppy is a very strong chewer. After demolishing several smaller bones and puppy kongs, I decided to buy this bone, hoping it really would be good for a strong chewer. It has proved to be everything that Nylabone says it would be. He likes it, and has barely ""made a dent"" in it. There are plenty more play hours to be spent with this toy, and we've had it for several months.Recommended for labs, retreivers, and other big dogs who love to chew!"
3,Ok if you use with supervision....,"We have a 70lb lab mix (9 months old) and is notorious for destroying ""virtually indestructable"" toys. We have spend a lot of money trying to find one that would last more than a few minutes without getting pieces off of it. Unfortunately this is one of those toys we bought and literally within 5 minutes he had worn deep grooves in one end and within 10 minutes he was carving small pieces off of it. Although to be fair, this bone lasted longer than most that we bought. This is definitely not a toy for an unsupervised dog."
4,Percussive tribute to the Masters,"Though it has strong of presence of congas and latin percussion sounds, it is a great delight to listen to tunes such as ""So What"" from Miles Davis, ""Moose the Mooche"", or the happiest ""Salt Peanuts"" from Dizzy Gillespie, in truly great performances. It's a very nice record to listen to and of course swing even sitting at your home office or dining room."
4,Not bad actually,"This autobiography was actually more enjoyable than Judith Krantz's latest book ""The Jewels of Tessa Kent."" I had no idea she was brought up in such a wealth family. Unfortunately, the wealth did not bring happiness. Her mother, whom she was constantly trying to please, was cold and aloof and her father, who Ms. Krantz adored, was more interested in his many mistresses than he was his children.The book is written in a friendly, almost chatty way. I felt that I got to know a little bit about the author - the good parts of her life anyway - she left out anything bad happening and even put a somewhat sunny glow on alcoholism and abortion. The only time I got the impression that her life was not going as expected was when she discussed her first boyfriend (a total jerk) who sexually molested her at the age of 15.Yet, the book is very enjoyable. I would recommend it."
2,I can't even say I read it........,"""Sex and Shopping......"" leaves a lot to be desired! I love Judith Krantz fiction but....this one was too down-to-earth and real for me. I could not get interested in this book no matter how hard I tried. Judith, don't take this the wrong way but you need to stick with FICTION!"
3,gemmy repairs inebitable,I have 2 of these deer heads while they are a creative wonder they will eventually have failures. one of min its mouth failed just 2 weeks out of the box and the other the turn of the head from side to side failed. i am currently trying to repair the one with the head turn issues. It took me one hour to get to the motors and i stillneed to remove the motor to fix it. it is very complex. if you purchase one be careful the repairs can be very time consuming.
4,Great party game,This game is great fun. Especially if you are creative and need a break from strategy games. I played this at a party at my sisters place and had to buy my own. It is one of the most requested games when ever I have friends over.
1,You Must Be Joking. A Definite Do NOT Read.,"I seldom write reviews, but this false-marketing requires exposure. I was intrigued by the little known author upon reading the other reviews for this book (though I now note it appears this may be a self-promotion ploy as the book was printed by the author and Amazon reviews were submitted by her husband and likely other friends or family). After reading the short book (a series of the author's jumbled recollections) I was left intensely unimpressed. The author's style is childlike, without skill for professional composition (fragmented sentences, lack of flow, etc.). Reader is left wondering ""what is the point"". The book is intended to be inspirational, but the revelation is barely visible. My impression is this book is yet another of the author's pleas for attention and sympathy as she herself chronicles in her book. Do not waste the 15 minutes it will take you to read Schriner's Bent Not Broken diary."
1,Cracked Wheat,The bag arrived in very good condition.The one star reason:I was very disappointed that the bag of cracked wheat was not the coarse kind but was like very fine flour. It is the coarse kind that gives bread the nutty texture we so love in our family. I don't think it was advertised clearly enough for me to catch the difference but it's been awhile since I ordered it so I could have forgotten.
5,Galaxy Angel A (Awesome!),"I don't care what others say about the voice actors I think they rock. This anime is full of fun, I almost laughed my head off watching it. So for those party poopers out there this cartoon was great!"
3,nice but too delicate for 2 year old,"Very nice set, but to delicate for a 2 year. And it items were very tiny."
1,Don't buy this one.......,"There is nothing wrong with this video, however, it is EXACTLY the same video as ""The Art of Hitting Slow Pitch Softball"", but that one has 15 extra minutes of instruction. Don't waste your money by purchasing both like I did - just buy ""The Art of Hitting Slow Pitch Softball"" and you're getting what you need at half the cost."
3,Alan Parsons' Live Album Redux,"This release, part of BMG's Extended Versions series, is a repackaging of Alan Parsons' 1995 live CD. That CD contained 15 tracks whereas this 2004 release contains 10 tracks, as follows:1. Sirius2. Eye In The Sky3. The Raven4. Time5. Luciferama6. You're Gonna Get Your Fingers Burned7. Prime Time8. Limelight9. Don't Answer Me10. Standing On Higher GroundUnfortunately, as is the case with other releases from BMG's Extended Versions series, there is no information about the concert from which these tracks are taken, nor is there any information about the band members who contributed to this album. Serious fans of The Alan Parsons Project probably already own the 1995 live album but casual fans, for whom this CD was most likely created, will probably enjoy it as I did.My rating is closer to *** & 1/2."
2,"Okay, but I don't agree with many parts","This book goes into great detail of the life of Jesus Christ, and his teachings according to the Bible. One thing I resented was the author's belief that Jesus did not walk on water, the author refers to it as a figure of speech. He also denies that Jesus actually fed 5,000 with 5 loaves of bread and 2 fish, again referring to it as a symbol, not as an actual occurence. Although meant in a good way, it still apalled me to hear this, as a Christian who believes the Bible is the absolute truth. If one can say those events did not actually happen, what else could be said about the credibility of the Gospels? I would recommend reading the BIBLE to study Jesus' life."
4,Useful video tape for the beginner,"The structure of presentation allows a very good practical comprehension of most of the basic principles of taijiquan (T'ai chi is a commonly accepted misspelling of taijiquan, therefore making it a misnomer). The 24 moves form is shown clearly. Author's background in the art appears impressive. I ask my students to buy this video.The authors of the video make little or no reference to the theoretical or philosophy of the art, and that's OK. Since this video is for beginners, it would be preferable to have included references to other more complete sources of information, such as the work of Lawrence Galante and perhaps have quoted some historically known taijiquan masters. END"
1,not worth it for my purpose,"i purchased this expecting to hook up a garden hose to my kitchen faucet...it leaked. with plumber's tape, it leaked, with electrical tape i tried too..leaked..no luck. not fun unscrewing it from the base either, since there's nowhere to grip. had to use needle nose pliers to get it off, and now it just sits in the drawer."
4,Wrong picture,"The tape seems to be of a ok/good quality. Not sure about precision yet. Unfortunately the tape only measures inches and feet, there is no metric measurements as shown in the picture. In all, it's a simple design that should do what it needs to do."
1,Spend your money wisely,"I was accepted to Stuyvesant High school. To prepare for the exam, I used almost all the books available on the market, including Arco.Do not plan to rely on Arco books as a primary source of test preparation. The questions are not challenging enough. The reading passages do not share the same depth of analysis like those found on the exam. The math questions are much too simple and require almost no thinking skills whatsoever. The logic questions do not encourage the reader to reason through a situation. As a result, the user of Arco books is mislead about the exam's degree of difficulty."
5,Tried and True,"ARCO's Specialized Science High Schools Admissions Test guide was a staple when I was preparing for the big test. It explained the exam format, gave test-taking strategies, and provided ten short sample quizzes. It gives a wide variety of sample questions, and explains why the right answer is correct. Using this resource, I made the Bronx Highschool of Science! If you are serious about the science high schools, the ARCO SSHSAT book is a must."
2,Not quite match the real test,I bought this book and the Barrow's book. My son took the 2007 Specialized High School test and he got over 600 point. He said the Barrow book is much better and helpful. This book does not match the real test at all. You may use it as a practice IF you have time.
5,A must have for any 8th/9th grader taking a specialized test,"This is a great book to use for study purposes on entering any specialized high schools, such as brooklyn tech, bronx science, and so on... It gives you tests on questions you will recieve. then all the answers, + explanations and diff. techniques to coming about the answer... A must have for any 8th or 9th grader with hopes of going to a specialized high school. -Beerinder"
1,Dumb OLD TOY!!!!!!!!!,PANDA Z IS OUT OF STOCK FOR GET THIS BABYISH TOY I LOVE BRATZ CUZ THEY ROCK THIS WORLD SO DEAL WITH IT!LOVE GOTIC JENNY
4,Funny movie,"This isn't like the original three American Pie movies so if you're hoping it is, this isn't a movie for you. This movie is more on the raunchier side. You get a lot more T & A than previous Pie movies. Overall, glad I bought it."
2,MASSIVE NUDITY!!!,This movie was full of some very funny and very crude chuckles. It was just full of hot young naked women. I mean about every two seconds there was a young good looking naked chick.So if you like crude humor and you like naked women... this is for you.MASSIVE MASSIVE amounts of nudity.
1,Need zero stars,"This was the worst movie I've seen in ages. If you're too young to go rent porn, get to the store now. This movie has no plot, overuse of sex, nudity (all female of course, where is the full frontal male nudity), crude humor and is a tragedy that the American Pie title is associated with it. The original AP trilogy was good, there was a story line, a point to it. This along with it's predecessor is just an excuse for rauncy humor and a way to keep the silicone industry in business."
3,Typcial American Pie Franchise Humor,"If you have seen any of the American Pie movies, then you will know what to expect on this movie. Its the same type of humor. If you emjoyed the American Pie movies, you will enjoy this. If you thought the American Pie movies were trashy then don't watch this (seriously, what were you expecting?).I enjoyed this movie - so why a 3 out of 5? Well, the movie was badly edited. You can tell that the final product was not what was originally written, and they changed or cut out parts.Theres a trailer showing the midget frat playing football - thats not in the movie. You can also tell from certain scenes that the lady from the greek frat was going to betray the geek house, but that never happened which made certain scenes seem a bit out of place.Overall, a good movie. I paid $2 for this movie and its worth it. Full price? Maybe not."
2,substandard reproduction,"The Editorial Review for this book claims that it is an EXACT REPRODUCTION of the original book. This is a highly misleading statement. Many 19th century technical books have illustrations printed on fold out pages. This book was filled with these types of pages, but NONE of the figures in the original book have been reproduced because when the book was copied, all these pages have been left folded. Nabu press has many old technical books in its catalogue - lets hope that these all have fold out pages correctly reproduced. I hope that Amazon removes the misleading claim from the website that the book is an exact copy"
2,I have my Doubts,"Only 15 of the 30 pages in this booklet have anything to do with Andro. Event then its pretty mediocre stuff. However, for a low price, simple presentation of the 'possible' effect of andro supplementation, and the 'possible' uses of DHEA, protein, carbs, aminos, creatine, pyruvate, ciwugia and tibulus then this is a starting point. For the more knowledgeable give it a miss."
4,a good source of information,"Covers the hows and why of andro supplimentation. Very concise and based on medical research. In additon, very useful info on other suppliments such as DHEA and creatine and some dietary suggestions make this a helpful additon to any bodybuilding library."
3,"Buy the full album, Silvertears, instead","Since Evil's Toy has now released Silvertears, there's little need to buy this single. Sure, Virtual State and Inside Out are great songs, but both of those can be found on the full album. In addition to that, the remix of Virtual State is nothing special (it's rather slow and bland), and Single Effect is not worth buying this CD by itself. Unless you simply must have every Evil's Toy song available, don't bother...just get the full album, Silvertears, instead."
2,Repetitive,"Each piece starts out inteterestingly, but then repeats itself throughout and simply becomes nerve wracking. Perhaps this is for per-cussiionists who understand better what the musicians are doing."
3,Sample for Sale?,"My boyfriend bought this for me and even though I like it I feel like a sample should not be sold as the labeling indicates. It clearly states on the back ""Free Sample - Not For Sale"""
5,This has it all!,"It's no wonder the subtitle on this book is ""The Ultimate Active Getaway Guide"" -- it's got all the information you could possibly want! Finally, someone has written a book that not only suggests where to hike, bike, etc. but also gives wonderful information about inns and other enjoyable activities for your leisure time. The suggested itineraries are a big help and the layout is extremely user friendly.Kudos to Malcolm Campbell for bringing us the Ultimate guide!"
5,Great Baby Cream,We've used this product for our newborn with great success. Never seen a diaper rash! We received the product the next day after we ordered and we would recommend for anyone who has a baby.
5,Younger Looking Hands,I originally purchased this cream in Mexico to use on a new tattoo and found that it also worked wonders for the back of my hands. When I return to the states after my trips to Paridise my hands immediately shrink up from lack of humidity and look about 100 years old. I started applying the Bepanthen product that I had purchased in Mexico to my hands and after about a week I could see a definite improvement. After searching online I discovered that Amazon sold the ointment and purchased a tube there. It's a bit spendy but you don't need to use very much. I apply a couple times and day and am very pleased with the results.
5,There's nothing better!,"I currently live in the UK but am moving to the States next month, and was just checking Amazon to see if they had all the products I use. I'm heartbroken that they have such a mark up on this because it's imported from Europe. It really, truly, honestly is the best nappy/diaper cream you can buy. Nothing else clears up my daughters rashes like this stuff. Looks like I'll be bringing a LOT of it with me ;o)"
1,"Did not get the hardware, software, or the cords as pictured","When my wife received my package, there were no installation cd, no instruction manuel, no power cord,USB cord or other plug ins. All I received in the box was the interface itself and thats it. What good is the interface without any of the drivers and cords! Love Amazon, but will never go used again!"
2,Watch Out!,"I am having problems with mine and just received this today:The device might be having a hardware issue since you mentioned that you hot plugged it. Unfortunately, the repair department of M-Audio no longer repair this kind of device due to its obsolete version.I apologize for the inconvenience.Regards,Avid M-Audio Technical Support"
2,Blah!,"This CD harkens back to Bavarian ""volksmusik."" Think of ""Mack the Knife"" or ""Komm Mein Schatz"" sped up to a techno beat, with an annoying singer who can do nothing but brag about how all the girls love him.This is currently is hit in Europe, and I really can understand why. It's perfect ""Eurotrash,"" and it's really fun; if you don't listen to it too much. That said, it's pretty banal. Anton should stay in Tirol."
5,Enlightening,"This book will really makes you think. You will walk away with some form of enlightenment, whether it's about the choice of words that you use daily or the promises that are made,and are most often broken. It made me more aware of how I use 2 of my favorite words, and they are ""nice"" and ""great"" (chapters 4&5) Who would have thought that so much meaning was packed in those 2 words.Shar'Ron's writing skills are to be admired. I love and respect her for the courage it must have taken for her to bear her soul and tell her personal story.Iteria Mahaffey Todd"
2,"Good, positive book, but somewhat condescending in tone.","I like the Week-by-Week aspect of this book, and it is exciting to read about and see what is going on at any given time with you and your baby. However, I found the tone of the book somewhat annoying, in that it was condescending - I feel it was written by the type of ObGyn who would like to be the one making all of the decisions for a pregnant woman. I found the pictures of the women in this book somewhat silly too - this book makes it look as if pregnant women have nine months to sit around looking pretty in a bathrobe or leotard. (It even tells about how you can ""skillfully"" apply your makeup during pregnancy - not high on my priorities!) I think this book is best if used as a supplement to a book such as Sheila Kitzinger's ""The Complete Book of Pregnancy and Childbirth"" which gives you enough knowledge to ask the right questions and make good choices for you, your developing baby, and your family."
2,Skimpy; best as a calendar/organizer,Nice glossy pics and lots of space for writing but almost no useful information. Not to be used as a reference.
4,Easy to read but very informative,"very basic information, just enough to help you understand what your pregnant body is going through, also great for your partner to read and understand whats happening as the baby develops step by step. some books about pregnancy can be overwhelming with information, and can sometimes scare the mother. this book is not like that, very informative with great tips. i really enjoy looking at each week as i go through it."
5,Great for first time mom's,This is our first pregnancy and this book has been great. We love seeing what the baby looks like from week to week. The information on how my body is changing is very helpful. I would recommend this book to all my friends!
4,Good photos,"I bought this calendar for my first pregnancy back in 2001 and really enjoyed having a weekly reference. I am now on my 3rd pregnancy and was going to reuse the calendar so my 4 year old would be able to understand what Mommy is going through. But as I found with the first time, the weeks start on Monday, but none of my pregnancies were tracked that way. For the first pregnancy, I just starred the correct day and knew to flip when it was time. I think this time I will look for a calendar that I can fill in correctly. I still will use this calendar for the pictures though.Also, my aunt had her own copy to follow along when her daughter in law was pregnant. They lived in different states, and this gave my aunt a way to keep up with how her first grandchild was growing."
4,Drama!,"No one does drama like the Housewives. The episode starts off with Kim revealing her secret boyfriend to Kyle. He seems like an OK guy, but Kyle has apprehensions.Next up, there's juicy drama between Taylor and Lisa. Taylor decides to socially snub Lisa by not inviting her to a function, while inviting all the other girls. By accident, Lisa finds out. She hosts a tea party and demands an explanation. This leads to a big all out confrontation.Tensions mount. Somehow, all the girls end up taking sides and in an argument. The shocking news is revealed that Taylor has been telling people Russell beats her.This episode should be called, ""Who is your friend?"""
1,REUNION PART TWO,WHERE IS REUNION PART TWO!!! THESE VIDEOS USE TO BE POSTED AT 4AM AND NOW THEY ARE JUST GETTING UPLOADED LATER AND LATER! COME ON!!!!!!!!
2,Big let down for a finale,"The wedding was nice, but it certainly didn't take the place of what I've come to expect, given past real housewives finales. Big let down for me. I guess it was the best they could do given the unusual circumstances this season for the BevHills women (i.e. Taylor's husband)."
1,It's all about Kim...boring!,This episode is all about Kim and her rehab...not much from the other girls...part 3 is so boring. Don't waste your money
4,Peaceful episode,"Not much happens in this episode.The ladies decide to go to Hawaii to celebrate Mauricio's birthday. They take a flight and bring the whole gang, including Brandi. Kim makes a variety of excuses as to why she can't come. She misses a bunch of flights.On the beach, Brandi wears a really skimpy outfit. This makes the girls excited. Brandi and Ken joke around. Lisa has good humor about it. Then, Taylor gives a phone call. The phone call basically just announces to Lisa and Kyle that Taylor has called it quits with Russel.The crew looks out at the Hawaiin ocean."
1,Virtual replay of Reunion Part 1,"Don't waste your money if you've already watched Part 1, because this is just a replay of the same video. If there is any new material, it may make up 5 minutes but certainly not worth buying."
1,Wish I'd read the other review first,I would have saved $1.99 by reading the last review. Soooo boring listening to Kim and Kyle's boring problematic relationship.
3,BH what can you say,Over all very entertaining. It does amaze me how people of money can be as common as people with no money. That is why I watch the show I find the humor in this. It is very hysterical.
1,DVD arrived damaged and scratch up.,This product was not in good shape. It was used and not in good shape. Very disappointed in the product.
1,Disappointing,"I thought this would be a great cd and that the singers were all of the original artists. However, it is not the original artists and the group is not very good. If that isn't a problem for you then it is a great cd."
5,garden bridge,I love this garden bridge and set it up on my dry creekbed. It cracked me up watching my dog and cats scamper across the bridge. It also supports my weight and is very picturesque.
3,Decent quality but hard to use,"I got this for outside use. I figured once I mastered it I could teach my nephew how to use it. However, without a steady platform it's very hard to use. You just can't hold steady enough to get a good look at the subject. Okay for table top use. The quality seems good."
1,Practically Useless scope,"Dont waste your money.No practical use,takes forever to focus to see something recognizable.Can be used by kids as a toy and nothing beyond that.If you want to review jewelry or use it for any hobby activities then look for something else,this wont do the job."
1,Of no use- not even as a toy,"As it does magnify an image, the image is distorted (very poor lens) , It must be held perfectly still and the depth of focus is limited.It is of too great a magnification for viewing - as a 'dissecting' style of microscope - as it is manufactured. Either material should be mounted of a glass slide and illuminated from below as with a laboratory compound scope or it should have been made with a lesser magnification ( 5X to 20X) for use as a dissecting scope.It took but a few minutes to discern that this ""microscope"" is quite useless. A simple 10X loop provides more viewing and clarity.As a former biologist, I should have known - it just not possible to magnify to that extent and expect a low cost lens to provide satisfactory images."
1,dissapointed,"the scope arrived in good shape however it did not work out of the box. I did not do enough due diligence. if I had I would have known it was only about 3 or 4 inches long, which is much too little to try and hold steady and adjust the zoom and focus. I would not reccommend this product."
2,Toy like magnifier,"Great idea, but the field of view is very small and in not well suited for insect identification. Will upgrade to a better scope next. Price is cheap and will make a nice gift."
5,LCXL,"Works really good see things up close and personal. If you have a cat or dog take a swab of the gunk in ear- see if your cat or dog has ear mites. You will see them- pretty gross!! But any how bought this item for a great price, fast shipping and packaged real good to avoid damged that could happen during shipping. So you can't go wrong with this purchase, great price works really good."
4,Good Little Scope,This scope works well for quickly looking at items. The light eliminates well enough so the item is very clear. Not bad for the price.
4,Good size,"It works good on small objects, great zoom. The view window is not the greatest therefore is good for small objects."
2,Not so good,"I have 5 different magnifiers like this. This one rates second worst on my list. The light is ok, so it gets 2 stars."
2,its a toy,Don't expect to explore the scientific world with this equipment. I don't know how jewelers find it helpful because its certainly not meant to be held unsteadily with one hand. I could get buy with keeping it firmly on a table and gently laying items below a quarter inch opening for a hard to find and focus observation.
2,You get what you pay for,This is was pretty good at first look and seemed like a great product. The focus dial actually moves the lens which changes the sight picture. That means having to readjust the microscope and start the whole process again.I will look for something better.
1,Very Poor Quality Image,"OK, it was cheap. But the image is so poor that it's pretty useless. I had hoped that it would be an improvement from the old junior chemistry microscope I got as a kid in the 1960's. But no."
1,Inferior Optics,"The image produced by my brand-new Carson MM-200 device is blurry, distorted and otherwise unusable regardless of how its controls are adjusted.I'm not contesting the positive reviews; I'm just rating the unit shipped to me, and it sucks. Prospective buyers might want to consider that, as of this writing, about 47% of reviewers awarded this device 3 stars or less."
5,great product,I use this mainly to verify the trichomes are ripe on my medical cannabis plants before harvest. i had looked at more expensive version but this one seems to be every bit as good. works for me anyway. thanks for the great and inexpensive product.
5,Carson MM-200 Micromax LED 60x-100x Pocket Microscope,"Neat magnifier in a small package, easy to use, allows you to see all the neet little things,all for under 25$Carson MM-200 Carson Micromax LED 60X-100X LED Lighted Pocket Microscope"
3,Can't see anything,"The view is inverted as I read in another review, but good luck getting a clear picture of anything while holding this thing in your hand. Viewing area is VERY small, can barely focus on printing on a piece of paper on a table. I bought this to examine plants and flowers up close... not gonna happen with this thing. I bought one of those tiny Phresh microscopes which is easier to get a clear picture. My search for a cheap hand held microscope continues.Would not recommend this for viewing plants/flowers."
2,Poor quality optics make sharp focus impossible.,"The good:-""Pocket microscope"" is a very apt description. The unit is about the size of an average adult's pointer and middle fingers pressed together.-It's entirely plastic, but professional looking, and solidly built.-The LED lamp is nice and bright. Time will tell how long the batteries last.The bad:-The lens optics are so poor, that it's impossible to sharply focus on anything. Terrible chromatic aberration. I had a cheap toy microscope as a child that looked better than this.Overall rather disappointed in the purchase. You get what you pay for; it's so cheap, it's not worth the time and cost of shipping to return it."
5,Worth more than the price would indicate,"This little microscope is fun! Not professional grade, but I wasn't expecting anything like that. We've looked at all sorts of surfaces using this cool tool. I uploaded a couple of pictures to the Amazon description. Check them out."
3,Really tiny,This scope is really tiny and if you're not using a steady hand it is impossible to use. I will end up buying a large magnifying glass and give this away. The best zoom is 60x and anything other than thay you cannot focus on anything and have only blurred vision.
2,bad placement for light,"achieving focus is quite difficult, The littler silver ones have a much better lighting mechanism, so that your mobility isn't botched when you are inspecting the specimens. Ive seen better for less."
3,not bad,the clarity of the optics is good but the focus is a bit of a pain. I like the 30x for most usage.
3,Get what you pay for.,"To start with i'm not complaining... this thing was very inexpensive.I gave 3 stars because you need to be completely stationary, truly immobilized (both you and the object of interest) to get even a whisper of clarity out of this. If you are hoping to take this out into the garden and see anything, at all, you will be disappointed. If you want to cut pieces off your tomatoes, bring them inside, and see them close-up you'll love this; just depends on your needs.If you want something that is very effective, and very cheap get the ""40x Mini Magnifier Magnifying Glass LED Illuminate Jeweller Loupe"" on Amazon. It also has an LED and gives incredible clarity without the need for immobility."
3,Portable microscope,Its ok. It is difficult to use this in my application. It's just to loose. Difficult to focus. It does work
3,Difficult to use,"I assumed that this item was a loupe of sorts but it is not. The directions are sketchy and I have yet to figure it out. I will work with it and let you knowl. So far, not very impressed."
1,Pocket Microscope,Absolutely terrible picture - something inheritantly wrong with optics - thought first one was a 'rogue' but replacement was exactly the same. Cannot understand how this ever came to be marketed.
4,OK,Cute and handy little microscope that can be used by kids and adults.A little hard to see image because of the size.
2,pretty much a toy,"I bought this to look at the trichromes on my plants. It is small, but that's not the problem. To use it i have to take off my glasses. The subject you're attemping to view my be absolutely still. The lens' are just not very good. Other than that it's a great kids toy."
3,Not Happening,"It is what it is. It isnt very usable, hard to focus, hold still, see through. It just wasnt a good pocket micro for me."
1,Weak,"This product is very disappointing in my opinion. The LED ruins the image you're looking at, drowning it in blue light. Also, unless the object is stationary and flat, its incredibly hard to find focus and when you do its not a great image. Worth the money? Maybe. Worth the aggrivatin? No."
4,Everything is inverted,"Great little scope, but they forgot to mention that everything you look at will be inverted. Yes, everything is up-side down, it will take some getting use to."
2,Not as good as I exspected,"My son has the same model, he said there is something wrong with mind, much harder to focus.I did not try his. when looking through it I see a dense layer of floaters which may be a reflection of whats on my eye. I have no other comparison."
3,"Works, but too small",I have medium sized hands and cannot use this tool efficiently. It keeps falling out of my hands due to awkward holding stance.
2,Save Your Money,"I bought this for checking edges on barber's razors, also known as straight razors. I sharpen them and use them for shaving. The scope is a pain to focus as other reviewers have mentioned and in my opinion the optics are inferior. There is a learning curve with using the tool because of the inverted image and the difficulty in focusing while maintaining the view of the object. Once that is overcome the optical quality falls short. A 30x eye loupe from Widget Supply was a far better investment for my purposes. You pays your money and you takes your chances. In this instance I ended up a loser. So for me it was a waste of money. Your mileage may vary."
5,Just call me Mister Butterfingers,"Let me begin by saying, I love this microscope. For the money it is well worth it. I will always be an inquisitive person and this tool makes the world that much more fascinating.The light is very bright but the entire unit has enough weight to make it easy to keep track of. Having said that, if you have large hands, like I do, the controls can be a bit difficult to deal with at first. I found myself losing my subject from moving the microscope around while trying to operate the focus and enlarge controls. Once they get a little loosened up and you get more comfortable with them, this problem subsides.This product coupled with Wikipedia has really opened up my amateur entomology endeavors. Just what I need, another distraction. Thanks Carson!"
3,MUCH smaller than I expected.,"It's cheap, what can you say? It works and it's cheap. The image is a bit hazy, or at least the one I have is. It's also much smaller than it looks online. It's not much larger than a bic lighter, maybe 20%. Works decent, I magnified a piece of paper and could see the ink on each little thread of paper."
2,You get what you pay for.,"The image is upside down; the resolution is poor. Great size and concept, just poor execution. Not worth the money IMO."
2,way over promoted,item is good for..simple things that are not moving and held firm. not for use on plants still alive and or held in your hand. get a real microscope and take cuttings.
2,For the price I wasnt sure what to expect,"Does it work, yes, well not nearly as I had hoped. It is very tiny as other reviews have stated and how the adjustment knobs are placed it makes it even much more difficult to get it adjusted perfectly (without moving the item you are inspecting) and not move off center of the specimen."
5,Great Little Scopes,"I have bad eyesight and often have problems getting scopes in focus, this little one works with no problem. arrived fast and in good condition works great"
3,I'm sure it is good for something,"It seems sturdy, seems pretty easy to use, however I bought it hoping it would be helpful in identifying stones and it really isn't very good for that - however my finger looked interesting in it..."
2,Not useful for me.,I'm currently a medical student and thought this would be fun to use while looking at different skin and other things but find it not very useful.Here are my Pros:It is only about $14Cons:1. Images is slightly cloudy image. My guess is the cheap maybe plastic lenses.2. The Lighting is angle that anything flat and some what reflective will be too bright to discern. And the colors are very dull.3. The zoom and focus knobs are very stiff and make it difficult to keep the scope still while adjusting them.
3,Works well but More for kids to use,"Shipped fast like amazon usually does, I was just a lil surpised at the size cuase it is smaller than expected and hard to use for big adults u have to really scrunch over the lil things and watever your trying to magnify hass to be directly on the tip of the plastic lens cap but it magnifies very well and the led light is cool, I just think this is more for teenagers and kids to use than for at home for real projects ."
2,Small but not handy,"I bought this for my son (6) for Christmas because he loves science and loves microscopes and magnifying glasses. I thought this would be fun for him and that he could stick it in his pocket for on-the-go examining. The size is right, but I tried it out when the shipment arrived, and I was disappointed. It is very small, which it fine, but it is hard to focus. The LED light works fine, so hopefully he'll still like it, even if it just gets used as a flashlight. It's not worth the price. I paid a little more for this model because the ratings were better. Oh well, hopefully he'll like it anyway. I also purchased the jewelers loop magnifier for him for the same reasons as stated above. I'm delighted with that little gadget. The jewelers loop is easy to use and powerful enough to show interesting detail."
2,Not a great product.,did not like to small of a lens it needs to be larger overall to see anything very sensitive on adjustments
2,way too much trouble to use,"i got this to look for bugs, mites, fungus, etc on my gardening plants. it's way too labour intensive to try to focus it. the instructions tell you to press it to the leaf but that kind of defeats the purpose. why is it so hard to find a quality product that does what i want? this is NOT the one i want."
4,"Not exactly 60X, closer to 40-50x but still good enough","Not exactly the 60X to 100x more like 40-50x (true magnification compare to a large dissecting scope), but it is good enough given the size. I got it for the purpose of being able to read laser inscription on my fiance diamond, especially the one that is clear when the black stuff been wash away. This one def dose it. However, it took lot of time to get it focus on the girdle of the diamond. However for 15 bucks and the size it does work."
4,Good product..,"This little device is everything they advertise it to be. Yeah, it can be a bit sensitive to focus, but you learn to adapt quickly. Well worth the huge price tag. lol"
4,easy use,This pocket microscope handles the job I needed it for. Close up images are clear and bright. The price is right also. I recommend this product to all who need a microscope handy and ready to use in seconds.
1,Hardly useable,"This ""microscope"" is hardly useable. With a tiny viewing area and flimsy lenses, focusing is next to impossible. The zoom capability is worthless given the size of the viewing area and as such, the unit is not worth the trouble."
4,Great science toy!,"As a microscope, it's marginal.Yes, it works, but the image is tiny and the color temp from the LED light source makes it very difficult to see the subject accurately.Definitely worth the money.I bought this to play around with. My 4 year old daughter loves it, and it's not delicate.You can only see about 1/4"" of any given subject at a time. It is possible to get lost on the surface of a coin at first."
4,Pretty sweet microscope...,"Although this microscope can be hard to use at first, once you get it going it's just phenomenal! The difficultly often comes from trying to adjust the scope with one hand while keeping the object to be observed close with the other, or what have you. It's not really a fault of design more than just the reality of trying to use a hand held microscope!The LED is fantastic and very essential to this device's proper functioning.Past any initial frustration you may have with getting used to using this device you will love it!"
5,Impossible to beat in this price range,"Carson has made a nifty little scope here. It has magnification and focus wheels for an excellent range of vision. The led light is plentiful and brings out colors nicely. I use this little scope for botanical purposes, to determine the flowering stage and ripeness. The 50-60x range is perfect for this purpose. Portability makes this device ideal for field work.Highly recommended. I think this would be an excellent starter scope for young people just beginning their science explorations."
4,Great Product - Great Deal,"These types of magnifiers used to be very expensive, and never had a light on them.A useful tool indeed when doing 4 color process printing."
3,"Not good for insects, but good for other uses","This is a great deal on a great product. Cheap, great light source, and it magnifies well.BUT. I bought it to use for inspecting fragile bee specimens for identification purposes. I need to see the whole bee, or at least large parts of the bee, magnified, from a small distance away so I won't damage the bee. It does not work for this. You have to have the lens directly touching whatever you are trying to magnify or it does not work at all. And when you magnify something you can only see a small part of the whole if you are looking at something larger than the lens area."
2,not as convenient as you might think being pocket size and all,yes this product does workbecause of the size you wont use it that often and it would just end up being a young boy or girls toy for the afternoon till they got board of it.not practical for growing. get a larger one so you can really see.
2,not clear and hard to focus,"purchased this and other USB type (Aven) and single LCD display type, total 3 devices. This device is not clear and not really focus to see detail. Out of 3 devices, the USB type turn out the best, because once it connect to computer, picture is clear from your monitor and you can snap picture and email and save. if you really need a portable one, then use the single device with LCD display with battery (cost little more but it worth and very clear too.). this device cost me $13, so I won't bother to return it but to share with all. by the way, I used USB type when at work and use the single LCD type when traveling, for fabric exam."
2,Not Good For Everything,"The advertising states that ""making it easy to examine blood samples, bugs, and anything else that's worthy of a closer look."". This is not the case. It is not useful unless you can lay the microscope on a flat object, such as paper, stamps, coins, calligraphy, etc. For three-dimensional things, it is impossible to get a focus, due to the extremely thin plane of focus, and the shaking of your hands, however steady they may be. For flat objects, I would give it 5 stars, due to the extreme close-up view that it is possible to achieve. I took stars off for misleading advertising."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,This wasn't as big as the one I was hoping for. It's difficult to focus on a hike. I can't find the one that's about twice the size and is a little easier to operate.
1,Lousy product,I ordered this with high hopes after all the 5 star reviews. Turns out I can't even see through the darn thing because the area for your eye is too small - my eyelashes get in the way! I also can't get ANYTHING to focus no matter what I do with the dials. Maybe I got a dud but if not this is a crappy product!!
3,"Fun, but very small field of view","I may have had unrealistically high expectations for this. It's a nice toy. But the view-finder is very tiny - you really have to put your eye very close, in order to see more than a pinhole field of view. Holding it this close to your eye and simultaneously twisting the focus wheel to get a crisp image is challenging. Maybe with some practice I would have better luck. Aside from that, the magnification does go up very high."
2,Cheaply made.,"The glue used to hold the optical lens in place smeared the lens and you could not get a clear view of the item you wished to magnify. The seller gave me money off but after two or three uses, I threw it away."
5,Very nice does what is supposed to do,Very close up clear images. I really enjoy using it for what I do and just using it for fun.
4,Nice,"Very powerful pocket magnifier that was well worth the money. A little hard to stay on the subject if its not stationery,but if stationery its fine"
5,A personal encounter with atheism,"This book is the partly the story of a personal journey to atheism and partly a summary ideas about living without god. It is a very good introduction to the ideas and to the people who are atheist in relatively few pages. If you're wondering whether a nice person like yourself can be an atheist, or puzzled by a friend who is both an atheist and a good person, read this book and you'll understand. A good book for anyone who is coming out as an atheist to give to friends or relatives, or to peruse in order to marshal explanations for their new stance. Well written and friendly, it's a nicely concise view of atheism."
4,I liked it,This book was another good book on atheism. Very easy reading and gave quite good reasons for non-belief.
1,Quite pointless.,"I was given this book as a hand me down from and friend, and I have to say, I was sadly unimpressed. There is a vast collection of superbly written books on the subjects of atheism and science. This is not one of them. More like a barely passable first foray into the field.If this were only one of a select few books on the subject, I'd highly recommend it. However, that is not the case. The only reason to buy this book would be if you have already been through the great ones, in which case, there's nothing new here but sub-par writing and some personal anecdotes, so why bother?Pick up a Hitchens, Dawkins, or Sagan book if you're in the market for some rational thought. They're only a click away. Dollar for dollar, this one doesn't hold up to the greats by any stretch of the imagination."
1,NO IMAGINATION,"check the title before you release your CD. ""Liquid Trance"" was released by MAX music a few years back. try to be more original with your titles instead of ripping off other succesful comps.Max's cd was 100 times better then this excuse for a compilation."
4,eh...OK i guess,Good book... but there are better ones out there. I kind of like the old version. Has more problem examples.
3,Review of Power System Analysis,"This book is mostly based on the classic textbook Elements of Power System Analysis by the late William D. Stevenson, Jr. While Stevenson's book was concise and to the point stressing the fundamentals of power systems, the new book is stuck in the computational details. These unnecssary details clutter the presentation and make it for hard for the undergraduate student to know which information is important and which are secondary details. In other words, the student will not see the forest from the trees! My recommendation after using both textbooks is very loud and clear: as an undergraduate text, stick with the clear and elegant original text by W. D. Stevenson and use the bloated version by J. J. Grainger only as a reference for the interested student."
5,"Great model, better clarity","I had my initial doubts while buying this headphone looked bit pricey , but for last 2 yrs it has been performing outstanding. Great product."
1,impossiable to figure ounces,this scale is impossiable to be able to figure out the ounces. Unless you are just weighing pounds or half pounds I would recommend you do not purchase this.
3,Feels nice but don't see any difference,"It comes in a very tiny pump bottle. It does feel nice and soothing when I apply it on the eye area. But the firming, the tightening and the lightening claimed by the manufacturer are not there. Will not buy it again."
3,works but not very durable,The support relieved much of the stress and pain I felt in my elbow. Unfortunately it is poorly constructed. The strap broke on the first armband I bought and the cushion deflated on the second one.
1,"Works, but breaks","This is a piece of junk. Maybe it will work if you use it while sitting at a keyboards, but it broke on me after about 5 tennis games. The cheap plastic is just very brittle. Once it breaks, it's useless."
2,Didnt help too much and was uncomfortable,"I began to develop severe cramping and forearm pain from the combo of typing and holding my baby daughter (sick with colic) for hours on end on my forearm, until it would go numb. Playing tennis made the pain excruciating and i had to stop.I got this brace, and it really was too tight at its 'pressure point'. It felt like someone was digging their thumb into my arm, and it didnt spread the support out well.not too impressed."
1,Disposable,"I hate to beat-up a product or manufacturer, but this one deserves it. No problems with the seller at all. I've had two of the AirCast armbands and the product will work if only needed for a couple weeks. Unfortunately, tennis elbow does not seem to calm down that quickly. In a few weeks of use, this one curls up and becomes uncomfortable, ineffective, and more like a rubberband. After trying a few arm bands for tennis elbow, I recommend getting one of the more substantial arm bands with a neoprene layer from another manufacturer. The AirCast will end up in the trash or in your sock drawer with an old ace bandage. Good luck."
5,Chronic Tennis Elbow,This is the second Aircast Brace I bought since I have a chronic condition with tennis elbow. It fits just fine and it's comfortable since I use it while I sleep as well.
3,Not Aircast brand,"I bought this elbow brace to replace an Aircast brace that I have been using for several years. Love the brand. When the brace came it was packaged in a zip lock bag and is black not tan. It doesn't have the Aircast brand on it. It works fine, and I needed it or I would have returned it. Looks like a knock-off, not the real thing."
5,Instant relief,"These air cast forearm ""pillows"" are perfect for repetitive stress in the forearm area. Instantly literally make the pain disappear! I would recommend these to anyone who suffers from repetitive stress"
2,Aircast Tennis Elbow Support,Washed in cold water after a couple of wearings. Foam separated from the band. Very poor quality. Glue does not hold up during cold water wash.
4,Aircast Elbow Support,I have used this product in the past for golfer's elbow and searched for it again when the same problem recurred. It substantially relieves pain in the forearm near the elbow during the golf swing. It does not eliminate the source of the pain but makes it possible to play a round of golf reasonably comfortably.
5,best food storage containers,I bought some of these a long time ago and decided to buy more as Christmas gifts. They are well constructed and the lids actually make a suction with the food so it seals even tighter. For the year or so I have had them they have not stained either. I am sure they will last a long time.
2,stained very easily,"The plastic appeara very sturdy enuf but unf even a little bit of spice, mainly turmeric will stain it permanently... no amnt of scrubbing remves that!!!!!!"
4,Great for leftovers,"This is my second set of the Premier series. We use these for leftovers, taking lunch to the office and pastries. No matter what was in the container they have been easy to clean, especially with spaghetti. Don't waste you money on the cheaper sets, they never come clean."
4,"Good quality, durable","This a great set, especially for the price. The lids are a little weird--I always feel like they're not all the way on (which is really the only reason why I didn't give five stars), but I haven't had any problems with leaking or anything. This set is a must have for people who have a lot of leftovers."
5,Love It,This Rubbermaid Premier stuff is the best I have found for food storage and reheating and freezing. I just wish I could afford more!
5,Perfect Gift Item - Most Popular at our Christmas Party,"For our Xmas party at work, I bought this set because of its features, name-recognition and price. We played 'dirty Santa' and this item was the most stolen item of the afternoon. Everyone wanted it...including me. The most interesting features on the product were no-BPAs and the fact that it's non-staining. The sizes and appearance are very attractive. I personally love that the lids and containers can stack together and nothing gets lost. The flexible lids fit snugly and the containers stack nicely in the fridge. Most of my plastic containers are opaque; these are absolutely clear which is much more desirable. Great job, Rubbermaid!"
3,Great except they don't seal liquids,"Like the stackability, and lids lock into each other. The deal killer is that they do not seal in liquids. I bought the more expensive rubbermaid to use camping and picnicing and found that if it tipped, any liquid would leak out. Never used in microwave or freezer and were hand washed most of the time, so that wasn't the problem.Rubbermaid 7J12 Premier 20-Piece Food-Storage Container Set"
3,Need a bigger set,"The actual quality is amazing. As far as storage, you can eaily snap the lids together to fit in your cabinets. The only complaint I have are the options of the containers. In reality, you will only use a few for daily use. If you are a big salad person, get this set. The smaller containers are great for dressings."
1,"Overpriced , overhyped....do not last long","I purchased several of these sets and am so disappointed. I just threw another container away today as I unloaded my dishwasher & it had cracked! I owned the older version with the grey lids and switched to the red rimmed BPA free ones. Was impressed by all the positive reviews before i bought them. I loved how the lids stacked together and how the containers stacked to take less storage space after I purchased them. Even bought one of the BPA free sets as a gift for my Mom.The ones I use the most have fine crazing, stains or have cracked and had to be thrown out. Called my Mom to ask her how the containers she had were holding up and hers also have crazed and cracked and she has also thrown some away (& she does dishes by hand yet!). For the price paid and the rubbermaid brand I expected better quality & much longer use. I will not recommend these to others and will look for other storage containers."
5,Its Rubbermaid...,"It is a great brand name, all the sizes were there, I didn't have to go to Walmart to buy them, and my wife will never know that I lost the other ones these replaced!"
3,works good,I really like this set. It serves its purpose and does not leak. This product is exactly what I was looking for.
4,Wish it came with more larger pieces,"While this item comes just as described, it could only be made more perfect if it came with larger pieces. I prefer sets that come with more 2 cup containers rather than several 1 c bowls or smaller. I like the larger bowls to cook and freeze food in. You can't do much of that in the smaller containers. This set comes with only two 2 cup container."
5,Rubbermaid Storage Containers save space!,Love this product. I got some for Christmas and had to buy more. They all stack conveniently and is it nice to have 4 different size containers and only 2 different lids. Lids snap together to help stay organized. They save so much space! I would highly recommend buying these Rubbermaid storage containers.
1,Not BPA-Free,"I thought these were the greatest containers until I found out they had BPA. As the prior reviewer stated, to Rubbermaid's credit, they are very clear that it contains BPA.In 5 minutes of research I also learned that there is a panel of 38 indpendent experts on BPA that has rejected BPA as unsafe. See http://www.ewg.org/reports/bpatimeline or simply Google ""ewg bpa""."
5,Good Product. Great Price,I started my new layout and needed some automatic Switches. Atlas is a great product and the price was the best I could find. It was shipped and arrived early and in great shape.
2,"THIS IS NOT THE HORNBOOK!! THIS IS A DIFFERENT BOOK!!! ""SEARCH INSIDE"" IS MISLEADING!!!","THIS IS NOT THE PAPERBACK VERSION OF THE HORNBOOK. THIS IS A CANNED-OUTLINE WRITTEN BY THE AUTHORS OF THE HORNBOOK. DOES NOT REFERENCE CASES SPECIFICALLY OR OFFER A DETAILED ANALYSIS. MORE OF A ""STUDY AID"" ON PAR WITH EMMANUEL'S. FOR SOME REASON AMAZON CONFLATES THIS BOOK WITH THE HORNBOOK SERIES AND OFFERS IDENTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND DESCRIPTIONS FOR BOTH! DO NOT BUY THE PAPERBACK IF YOU WANT THE HORNBOOK!!"
2,Not very clear or concise,"As the title indicates, this text is not very clear on concise. The authors introduce you too a great deal of information on contract law, which on the surface appears to be very helpful, until of course, you begin to read the text. Once you begin to read it, you will become confused as the shear amount of material thrown at you is difficult to understand and is written in incredibly long, run on sentences.Recomend that you get an Emanual outline insteadTHIS REVIEW DOES NOT APPLY TO THE WEST HORNBOOK. FOR SOME REASON AMAZON HAS COMBINED THE REVIEWS FOR THE HORNBOOK AND THE BLACK LETTER OUTLINE FOR CONTRACTS.THIS REVIEW APPLIES TO THE BLACK LETTER OUTLINE FOR CONTRACTS BY WEST"
2,No So Good,"As fair as studies aids go, this one is not very good. While concise and simple, the book really lacks the aid aspect. This book is like buying a textbook and reading it. In addition, I felt it times it wasn't very useful. I would read the UCC (especially 2-207) material and feel like I wasn't any better off than when I left class. I would buy instead the Emmanuel's and/or the Emmanuel Flash Cards if you want a stronger study aid. Unlike those additions, this book lacks the useful charts and acronyms that help when you're trying to remember the series of questions to ask yourself on the exam. In essence, if you are going to buy only one guide, and you don't need a second textbook, don't buy this one. However, if you haven't been going to your first year classes this is a good book to buy."
4,Better than the nighttime talkshows,"This show is a great relief from the usual stupid chitchat talk shows. Here there is genuinely intelligent discussion, and argument, on both the art and business of making movies. This is especially true of these first episodes, more so, that is, than the current shows being aired. I particularly find it interesting and bizarre to watch Peter Gruber's combative blindness to everything except profit. It was just grotesque watching him browbeat Laura Linney until finally she became so desperately conciliatory that she said she too wanted the money, though really, obviously, she is an actress because she loves the art of it. My only objection is that the DVD is the 'best of' and not the complete series. Laura Linney was on the show twice that first season. I would love to have seen what she had to say the second time around. And if they made a better job of her makeup."
4,One of my two favorite books of the season,"In this pretty book, we finally get to see more rooms. (Her previous books focused more on tight photos of objects, tabletops, and the like.) Another MUST-SEE book this season is Flea Market Decorating, which also focuses on decorating with such treasures. Flea Market Decorating is a bit more sophisticated than the shabby chic book, and it's fun for me to look at and read because I like to do thing my own way, and Flea Market Decorating shows me a variety of styles, whbile the shabby chic books are kind of limiting, style-wise."
2,Very Disappointed,"Browsing the free pages shown on Amazon I thought I was going to get a book with lots of Photos of ""shabby"" style furniture and tips on how to get the look.Instead what I got was a book that reads like a 'day in the life of' story.I didnt want a biography.This book takes you along on the authors trips to assorted flea markets and whatnot and tells you what she bought and where she is going to use it.Not at all what I expected to get."
5,sHABBY cHIC tREASURE HUNTING,"I FOUND THIS BOOK VERY HELPFUL AND INSPIRING. WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BUYING A VACATION HOME & I ALSO NEED TO START LOOKNG FOR NEW FURNITURE FOR MY SON. AFTER READING THIS BOOK I AM INSPIRED TO GO TREASURE HUNTING AT THE LOCAL FLEA MARKETS INSTEAD OF BUYING EXPENSIVE, MASS PRODUCED FURNITURE THAT I WOULD HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR. THIS BOOK IS WONDERFULLY INSPIRING & IM GLAD I FOUND IT! THANK YOU!"
2,Limited,I was very disappointed in this book. The photography was beautiful but the contents were not particulary helpful. I felt I could have gleaned the same amount of information from a brief magazine article. Overall it was much too shabby and very little chic!
2,Why didn't I think of doing something like this?,"My own solace, is that I purchased this book as used. I was truly hoping to gather ideas on how to take some of my found treasures and turn them into more useful and interesting pieces. But the Grimm truth is that this is just a fairy story about a shabby chic princess who can afford a home on the beach. My little Craftsmen bungalow is about a mile from the river...does that count? I found no inspiration here but rather an excessive use of white paint on walls, ceilings, beams, etc. Does she own stock in Sherwin Williams? I did order a few of her other titles which are a bit more useful. Alas, I should have perused the shelves of the Carnegie and checked it out before spending my hard earned shekels."
3,From junk to pretty junque.,It is a pretty good book if you are into making the most out of found items for decorating. It's emphasize is a little too flowery romantic style for me but if that is your style this book has a lot of ideas. It would be perfect for the 20 something female in college or in her first apartment who likes the feminine artsy junque look. This author is creative and her ideas are pretty. Not alot of new ideas but nicely done pictures for inspiration.
2,A bit disappointed!!!,"I must admit I usually write only positive reviews as I buy books very carefully. This is unfortunately a wrong buy. I like the Shabby Chic style and since she's the person to get inspiration from on this style, I immediately bought this book without hesitation. I must say I wasn't inspired at all not even on one item and I am usually quite easily inspired by just reading a mag, browsing through ebay or simply walking around the market. The pics are big but on flowers?? I think I should've got the first book instead."
3,Somewhat interesting...but overall disappointing,"I was really excited about getting this book....I was hoping to get something that inspired me to find neat design solutions in the mundane and everday. You know...make something out of nothing.Well, there WERE some good ideas like that in this book, but I felt that unless you were a HUGE fan of flowers and girly prints you wouldn't really find much of use in this book. Granted, it's probably a personal style conflict that made me return this book, but if you can find this book used and for a good price, go for it. Not worth the full price."
2,Disappointing,"The book covers some of the things I find in my favorite decorating magazines, such as Better Homes and Gardens, but it lacks the depth and the variety that I want. This is one person's view of design, and there isn't room for me to develop my own ideas or insert myself into these pictures. I prefer magazines and books that respect my intelligence and offer a wider range of ideas and styles from which I can choose."
4,"This is ""Loaded"" with good songs.","There's some ""DJ"" fans who will only listen to their early albums, but I actually really enjoy everything they've done, and this is no exception. ""Hand It Over"" is probably most similar to ""Without A Sound"", which would make sense. In fact, ""Nothin's Goin' On"" is kind of the ""Feel The Pain"" of this album, to my ears anyway. ""Never Bought It"" is a great track, as is ""Mick"", and ""Alone"" has the old ""Neil Young"" epic feel to it. The only track that's a bit jarring is ""I'm Insane"", mostly because it has horns on it, which some may like. I'd say if you're a fan of 90's ""Dinosaur Jr."", you'll want to dig this up. They do have a collection out also."
5,Under-rated,"I read somewhere that the reason this album didn't sell more was because Dinosaur Jr was at the end of its contract with the record label so the label didn't push it at all. That's a shame, because this truly ranks among Dino's best.J Mascis again supplements some of the best guitar work ever with a number of different instruments (including the trumpet on this one). My personal favorite on this CD is ""Never Bought It"" but there are lots of great tracks."
4,Good end to the legacy dinosaur jr,This album was a good in terms of the fact that dinosaur was finshed (J mascis isnt finshed yet) and the songs were like a mix of the years past the bug-era. My favorite on the CD was Im insane and nothings going on. J mascis is a true singer and he is doing great with is new band. Also check out the BBC sessions and martin and me for the last taste of dinosaur.
2,casters are loud,"Casters are loud on hard surfaces (concrete, tile, etc), which makeit unsuitable for moving while filming video. The telescoping armsare nice and the clamps grab the tripod legs without problems.There is an option for flipping down feet while flipping the wheelsout of the way for converting it into a stationary base, but I donot see how this could be achieved easily with the equipment on thetripod, so I doubt the value of this feature. While this dolly is usefulfor keeping your camera setup intact and rolling into position or out ofthe way between shots, I suspect that one with rubber wheels would be abetter overall option."
5,audioquest hdmi3 csble,this cable made an extreme improvement in picture clarity and detail.colors are much more vivid.i will definetily buy another when i purchase a blu-ray.
1,unnecessary,HDMI is digital. Any HDMI cable that works with your equipment delivers exactly the same video and audio quality. Buy one for $5.
1,Not as advertised.,"Songs on disk not songs on disk box or as advertised. No English version of butterfly as advertised. Some songs didn't sound like Girard. Sounded like a pirated copy.Purchased from mediapearlcom. Got permission to return for refund. Was given an address in Germany to Medimops!. Postage for return was $5.20.IF they refund my account, I'm still out some money.No more doing business with mediapearl (medimops).12/29/2011: Additional comment: I received notification that the CD has arrived in Germany. Also that Amazon is refunding the cost of the CD and the postage. I am out $5.20USD. And CD is apparently no longer for sale."
4,clasic zombie style,"this is the second zombie book I read that was full of typos, the first was ""the dead"" (another great book) none of the mistakes seemed to bother me though, for I'm a crappy speller too, (allthough someone will be editing the zombie story I am writeing) This was basicly a clasic style zombie story. Just great for all you Zombie fans who hate it when people wander from Remero's original vision. Personally, I like a little diversety in a good zombie story, but this clasic type tale was right on and lot's of cool action. Gory, gory, gory, one of the scenes in the morgue almost made me sick (that is good).I was expecting a little more of a fun story from the title but the small amount of comedy was good and I really liked the little gun slinging kid. The author's hatred for police was quite obvious but the rest of the charactors seemed real enough. So if you like this stuff check it out, It was a good time."
3,Authors Imagination Interesting,AFMOM 63841The Author has a very interesting imagination. It's cool he writes about Ohio the state he has lived all his life. I wonder why he didn't catch the misspelled words. Or was it for a reason? And he did it on purpose. Especially since he is so intelligent. I have always thought People who are very smart has a weird sence of humor and an active imagination. All Joe wanted to do was go Fishing. I bet Joe thinks twice before he goes again. The Book was fun to read and was very different. I wish the Author nothing but the best. And I hope he makes it to be a great Author.
1,Movie looks fun... DVD is terrible!,"The film itself looks to be a lot of fun, especially if you're into silly (and extremely cheesy) masked wrestlers vs. monsters flicks like I am. Unfortunately, the DVD is so terrible that I couldn't get past the first 15 minutes. The audio is absolutely horrible, full of constant static. Adding insult to injury, THERE ARE NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES. (It's too bad Rise Above Entertainment - the folks who've brought us some great El Santo discs in the past - didn't get their hands on this one.)"
5,Amazing Contribution,"This book, together with its companion, The Women's Passover Companion, is a wonderful, wide-ranging compilation of beautifully composed thoughts, rituals, readings, and reflections by women from across an incredible spectrum of backgrounds. The two volumes represent not only a culmination of over thirty years of growth in the Jewish women's movement but can also stand alone as works that capture a breadth of Jewish women's voices at this particular moment in history.The books are equally suitable for the Jewish professional and the Passover novice. No matter your age, religious affiliation, or political ideals, these books contain a multitude of readings that will resonate for you--and countless other readings from which you will learn and expand your understanding of the Passover holiday. I recommend them strongly no matter where you are on your journey through the wilderness."
5,A book that really seems to make a difference!,"As a Christian counselor I receive promotional books on occasion, and when I received this book I asked my wife to take a look at it and give me her opinion. Her response surprised me! She loved this book to the point she couldn't put it down. She said it addressed several personal issues for her that had been lingering for some time. She liked it well enough that she gave copies to several of her family members. I purchased several copies to sell or give away at my counseling office. Each person I gave it to remarked how insightful the book was and how much of an impact it was making in their lives, especially the part on forgiveness. One counseling client came back and bought 5 or 6 copies to give to her family members! Hey, that reminds me, I need to reorder....I think I have run out!"
4,Exotic Fruits,"This is a beautiful book of lovely photographs and tempting recipies. Great for summer parties & cook outs. Mango and guava are my favorites & there are wonderful recipies for these in the book. Could also be used as a ""Coffee Table"" Book because of the attractive photography."
3,"For the money, not a bad deal","Somehow I thought the book would have more substance to it when ordering. The book is mainly a picture book of pretty color photographs of fruits with a few recipes on the author's preferred method of eating. It's neat to picture rare fruits I had not heard of before, but it is not a guide on how to grow the plants, it just has pictures and some recipes."
1,worthless junk,I bought photo impact pro 11 with the understanding that it will work with vista. It even has a sticker on the box that says it. I installed it on my computer and it doesn't do anything at all but freeze up my computer. I uninstalled it and tried again and nothing. I downloaded the patch and nothing. I contacted the company and they never replied to my email. This was a waste of time and money and I would recommend that anyone who is interested in this should run the other way.
1,save your money,"SAVE YOUR MONEY! A third of the program won't launch, half the discs can't be read, some parts are never installed. Tech support? after being asked to register the product for the fifth time I found a long list of the same problems I have, with the ""support"" of no solution available at this time. I feel ripped off, and I'm not sure NOVA exists...."
2,Bad Purchase,The packaging was very nice and orderely and looked professional but when I went to install it there was an errer message in the installation hat I can't help but believe was known to be there by the seller thus the low price.
4,Good Sha Na Na,If you like Sha Na Na you will love this CD. The only complaint I have is that for some reason they did not sing Monster Mash in it's entirety. They left out the second verse that Bobby Pritchett had in his origional version.
3,Captions?,"First, let me say that I love lucha films and this particular series is possibly the most entertaining I've discovered. The movie itself gets five stars from me.However, this particular release by Ground Zero has a couple of faults buyers should know about:1. This release is _not_ captioned, in English or any other language To be fair, you don't really need to understand Spanish to enjoy lucha films, but based on the Amazon description I was expecting subtitles (FYI: the 'capitulos' in the menu means chapters).2. Video quality is considerably lower than usual. There are compression artifacts and other reproduction flaws that are hard to overlook or excuse, on top of the expected graininess and scratching."
2,Buyer BEWARE ! ! ! No Day of Outlaw !,"""Day Of The OutlawBurl Ives plays a wounded Army outlaw whose gang takes over a sleepy frontier town. Robert Ryan seethes as the cynical ranch-owner who joins antagonistic cowboy and rancher parties to combat the outlaw chieftain"" from the editorial review and customer review. THEY EVIDENTLY DIDN'T PLAY THE MOVIES OR READ THE COVER OF THE ALBUM. I BOUGHT THIS FOR DAY OF THE OUTLAW AND IT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE COLLECTION!!!!!"
2,Ok coffee,"The coffee was not bad but not excellent. I have had other coffees from Nicaragua and they were earthy and sharp. This was more like Folgers. I would recommend Nicaraguan coffee, but may be a different roaster."
5,"Not just a ""Childrens' Book""","We live near Ft. Jackson, and nearly everyone knows first hand a military person, active, retired, or deceased. This makes our community especially sensitive to the sacrifices of the veteran. I first saw this book in our school system; in nearly every classroom there is a copy. Although this book was written with children in mind, please, please do not set it aside as merely a book for children. It is a book for anyone of any age who is/was a veteran, who knew/knows a veteran, or who simply wants to show respect for a veteran. We used it very effectively as a tribute in the most recent annual reunion of the 20th Engineer Brigade. [...] The book was read aloud as a veteran in dress blues ""set"" the table. At the end, there were very few dry eyes in the house, including the bugler who blew taps after the moment of silence. All gave some; some gave all. Some never came home. This book is an excellent way to teach and give the respect due our armed forces."
5,Great book!,It honors those who have sacrificed so much for our country's freedoms!Great story to read to our children around Veteran's Day.
5,Awesome book for teachers!,"I absolutely loved this book. I had originally heard about it at a conference for history teachers. I had been looking for a kid to teenage friendly book that helped students understand the importance of our military. I read this book to my 6,7,and 8th grade classes, and we were all moved by the story. We set up a table honoring our veterans at our school's Veterans' Day Assembly. I highly recommend this book for teachers or parents who want to educate their kids on a wonderful way to honor and remember our veterans."
5,Wonderful book!,This book gives a wonderful description of a soldiers scarifice and what we can do to remember it. It is emotional in a good way and teaches the younger generation about freedom and it's cost.
1,Junk pan,"This dust pan is probably the worst item I have every bought through Amazon. I was hoping to replace my solid, old copper dustpan that served me just fine for nearly 20 years. Though the photo on Amazon looked just like my old one, the dust pan I received does not resemble it in any way. (1) It is as thin and flimsy as aluminum foil. (2) It arrived completely bent out of shape. (3) I am tossing it in the trash rather than waste more of my time trying to get a refund."
2,Blue Topaz Heart Neckllace Disappoints,I was disappointed with the Blue Topaz necklace. It feels flimzy and doesn't look nearly as nice as the picture. I will be sending it back.
4,Good but no so good,"I bought this for my girlfriend, When the package arrived i pulled out the necklace which i was a little disappointed in.First off the chain is not nearly as pretty as the one in the picture and I guess i had my hopes fo high.Also the camera is at an extremely complementing angle, which also made me a little disappointed when i compared the real necklace with the picture.The necklace is very sturdy(I have already dropped it twice)."
4,Gift,I thought it was worth the money it cost. Not high dollar gift but fair quality. I would buy this again or if looking for a quick gift. The necklace is a bit too short.
3,Lord Soth in Action,"Knight of the Black Rose is a very well written book by James Lowder. It chronicles the events of Lord Soth's life after his disappearance from Krynn. The black knight finds himself ripped from the famed lands of the Dragonlance and deposited into the world of Strad in Ravenloft. This book is full of great dark characters, and the reader gets to know more about the famed death knight along the way. The book has it all. The excitement and superb storytelling make it a fun read. The characters are richly portrayed and find themselves in exciting fights and difficult situations. Soth is forced to confront his past. As his future is left hanging in the balance, the death knight has amazing encounters with every sort of denizen and the confrontations he has with the vampric Lord Strad are the thing of fantasy legend. All in all this is an excellent read."
4,Pretty Good,"Pretty good book with an evil protagonist. The story is engaging, but the ending is a let-down. Soth is a very cool character; I don't know why the author doesn't say anything about why Soth turns evil; pride?. A refreshing change from normal fantasy books of good vs evil."
4,"Fairly dark, and an interesting look at Lord Soth","This book starts off where the last book of the Dragonlance ""Twins"" series left off. Right after the battle where Raistlin fights the dark queen and Dalamar and Tanis are holding the Tower...The part where Lord Soth shows up and demands Kitara's soul...Unfortunatly, Lord Soth's actions land him in Ravneloft, and right into the lap of Count Strahd. Strahd of course, is devious enough to keep out of the direct path of the Death Knight's fury... but a lot of others aren't so lucky.Soth is dark, cold and fairly cool as he destroys anyone who stands in his way in his search to find a way out. The ending was not a surprise, but it was cool enough to not take away from the book. Worth reading, but you probably won't get a full appreciation of it if you haven't read all six of the previous Dragonlance novels..."
2,information only,"I am a huge fan of ravenloft fantasy and soth,this is why im having trouble writing this but its the truth(mine anyway):The book though it gives a great insight into soths charecter is very poorly writen,my 3 year old sister can write a more sofistaceted plot and with much less holes(the dark keeper of the gate? please)it is completly void of all meaning and purpose... But to sum it up,if you are a soth fan you should try to read the book."
1,Never judge a book by it's cover,"The cover art is very eye-catching, but as the title of the review says, you should never judge a book by it's cover. As usual, Mr. Lowder's use of the English language is extremely sub-standard, as is the writing in general. He also proves himself unable to expand upon someone else's work, as the main characters go completely against all previously established personalities. I love this type of novel, and have understood the characters since their first appearance in both gaming and literature, and this novel made me truly nauseous. It's flat, dry, and poorly written. There is little in the way of character development and virtually no resolution. Even the ""gothic"" feel Mr. Lowder tries to evoke comes off as fake, as though written by someone describing it after a single exposure. My general opinion is that this is one of the worst novels of all time."
1,What the hell was that?,"This book was bad. REAL bad, even for a Ravenloft novel. The ""I, Strahd"" novels were interesting, unique and full of intrigue: what a Ravenloft novel should be at it's best. Lowder's grip of English is tenuous in that he offers no grace or emotion in his writing. The book is desert dry and, with a few modifications, would make a perfect book for pre-teens. How the hell did Lowder get this freakin' job? Characters are underdeveloped and flat, no suspense is ever developed, it isn't ""Gothic"" in the least, and no interest can ever be created in the lifeless pit dug where imagintion should be. Every time I finished reading a chapter I'd think: ""You got to be friggin' joking."" LOWDER CAN'T WRITE NOVELS. Period. Sorry James. Don't make this your day job."
4,Shocking!!,"This is one of the better Ravenloft books I've read, which really recounts a better part of the characters lives. A great storyline which provides a lot of detail and wanted explanation into the Dark Domains, and how Lord Soth came to visit this place. The undertermined fierceness of the dark lords is interesting as well, as they both clash in a stand-off. The ending will surprise you"
3,A Long Time Ago,"I got this book in the 90s and back then for me Dungeons & Dragons was a guilty pleasure. This kinda creepy book deals with the death knight Lord Soth. A death knight is a powerful undead featured in the Fiend Folio and Monstrous Manuel. Could be taken out one on one if you're powerful enough. Back then i wanted to be one with the darkness. Belief in the occult is a result of mental illness; bad luck is brought not by broken mirrors. but by broken minds. If you like horror, this is good."
3,IRON FREE OMNIUM,"Have been a user of Solgar 2000, and love the product. Tried Omnium but not certain if it is better than Solgar 2000. May try again , so will reserve my opinion for later."
5,Thought provoking.,"A very good read for those interested in non-canonized religious text.There is an introductory synopsis for each chapter, giving the reader insight into the context, author of the document, and target audience.This an excellent book for those looking for a summary of the Nag Hammadi writings."
4,Gnostic Gospels,This book provides readers unaware of the nature or scope of the Gnostic Gospels a thoughtful and thought provoking introduction to the subject. I now feel better informed on this aspect of Christian religion and traditions.
3,"Very interesting in parts, confusing in others.","That sort of book is difficult to ""judge"" or rate with a star system, given that this is a collection of different books, written by different authors, etc.The first texts are very interesting, especially if you have some serious knowledge of the Bible beforehand and if Christianity in general is an interest of yours. It can be inspiring and won't fail to surprise you. That's the good side of this collection.Now, there are books in there that are really cryptic. Stories where Adam and Eve have two children, Jahveh and God (or else, I don't claim to be super precise here, but I know Jahveh was in the lot)and etc, etc. I'm no specialist in the apocrypha, and I have to say that even with the introduction of Meyer, nothing made much sense in those more obscure stories.In conclusion, while there are some books here that are indeed very interesting for the non-specialist reader, there are others that will merely confuse you. I would imagine."
4,Wow I read a lot of these Gnostic texts,"Yet another in my library of ""religious"" documents. Religion and philosophy are two of my main interests and I get into more of what didn't make it in as opposed to what did make it in. Any rate, wonderful read. Interesting to read more of what the early Christians believed."
3,Okay but not that great,"I think this is a good book to have for reference or study, but not one that will sit down and read, or I didn't, anyways."
1,"""The Definitive Collection""... of Gnostic heresy...","If you need a cheap book of heresy to have on hand as a reference, this one is as good as any other."
3,MISSING PIECES,"why did Marvin Meyer leave out the most important book of Jesus Christ? Namely, 'The Sophia of Jesus Christ"". signed by his name. His main doctrine of Sophia has deliberately been left out of this book and also left out of The Gnostic Bible. In the diciples writings regarding the crucifixion not being of any saving value, then Jesus died in vain if his doctrine of Sophia has been hidden. Read THE SOPHIA OF JESUS CHRIST in the Nag Hammadi Library."
4,Comment from a non-English speaker,"The editor, Marvin Meyer is a professional in the study of Gnostic Gospels. If you only need a clear and simple reading on the translation of the Gnostic Gospel, this book is good choice. However, one thing is quite disappoiniting is that there is very little explanatory on the gospel. As the content and theology of the Gnostic ospels are very different from the main stream Christianity, it is quite difficult for the readers to understand the gospels. As a whole this book is worthwhile to keep, this book contains all the Gnostic Gospels discovered in the Nag Hammadi in Egypt. This book includes Gospel of Thomas, Gospel of Mary, Gospel of the Truth, Round dance of the Cross etc. The translation is easy to understand even for me as non-English speaker."
1,Horrible Service! Fast Breakdown!,"The Sound on my Koss home theater system stopped working 2 months after we bought it. Luckily it was still under factory warantee. Unfortunatly, after we sent it in Koss customer service was TERRIBLE! It took 2 monthes before Koss would even accnolidge they recived it. (I knew they had because of tracking numbers, but they wouldn't confirm that). They promised replacement units on 8 different occasions, sometimes even telling me it was in the mail when it wasn't. It took 3 monthes to get our replacement unit. Koss emplyees were very unhelpful, unproffesioal, and overall frustrating to work with. I will NEVER buy another product from them. My advise to anyone looking to buy a home theater system: Pay a little more and go with a good brand!!"
4,great for the price,"I've had this system for almost 3 years now and have never had a problem with it. The sound is pretty good for dorm rooms or small living rooms, but you would probably need something with more power for anything bigger. When I paid $75 for this I was only expecting something to get me through my freshman year at college and I've been pleasantly surprised ever since."
5,Best watch EVER purchased,"Bought this watch about 6 years ago. I'm rough on watches (I forget to take them off when gardening, etc.) and had the crystal replaced a year ago due to scratches. This watch has held up very well to abuse and I love the fact that it will never need a battery replacement. It is lovely enough to wear with dressy clothes and sporty enough to wear with jeans, my usual attire. One reviewer mentioned that the face is small and hard on aging eyes. I'm in bifocals and don't have any trouble reading it but there are many other Citizen Eco watches out there with larger faces. The technology is just super regardless of watch style and size. I can see no reason for purchasing a watch with a battery when solar/eco watches are available."
4,Delighted,Watch is beautiful and my sister is delighted. It looks delicate but can be worn daily. I like that it needs no battery for 10 years. Well priced compared to many watches including other Citizen ECO. Size was important and Amazon had size showing on each watch.
2,Eco Drive Watch,"The face on the watch was much too small. It looked like a child's watch to me. Be sure to pay attention to the size, especially if your eyes are aging. Otherwise very pretty piece of jewlery. My experience with returning it was very pleasant."
5,An insider's view of a historically important election!!!!!,"This is a very good book. IT is both interesting and enjoyable, but even more, it provides an insider's view into an important election. The election of '64 involved JOhnson and Goldwater which was a lopsided win for Johnson.This book helps you understand why this election was such a lopsided victory for the Dems, and what, if anything, could have been done to prevent this from occurring. It turns out that not much could have been done, especially given Goldwater's personality. Still, this book presents this to you in a very accessible manner. Get it and learn."
4,Good but not great.,"My houseguests loved it, but I didn't think it was the best Guatamalan that I have ever had."
1,Should be zero stars,"For even a ""popular history"" text, this book simply has too many factual errors in it to be taken seriously. The minor errors are disturbing, the big ones are appalling. His description of the Japanese fleet deployment and order of attack at the battle of Leyte Gulf is shockingly inaccurate. The battle of Leyte Gulf is one of the most significant engagements in the history of naval warfare. The facts surrounding it were well known by the time this book was written. How could this author have gotten it so wrong? And how could his editor have let it slide? And what does that say about the credibility of all the statements and conclusions presented in this poorly written book, other than that the photographs are very nice?"
1,Superficial re-hash of the Pacific War,This title promises much but hardly delivers. The majority (95%)of the book could be written on a computer by an amateur historian in a few days. And that's without much research! With regard to wartime China there is little beyond Tuchman's book about Stilwell. There seems to be sparse insight about American Imperialism. World War II books are popular now but they should present scholarly research or new syntheses. There are also annoying editing errors.
1,save your money,Not helpful or worth your time reading. I read an article about this book so I bought it. Maybe the author of the article was a relative of Ms. Weinstein.
1,Pretty City New York: The Ultimate Guide To Beauty,"Do not waste your money!I wouldn't even give a star, but Amazon.com made me. It was that bad!"
3,Great for color combinations,This book has a big emphasis on color and color combinations. The front of the book has pages of dried flower bunches grouped by color and the arrangements shown within the books pages all revolve around keeping within certain colors and color schemes to be used at particular times of the year or for certain occasions. Details a variety of different styles of arrangements and discusses texture and style. Photos are used to show arrangements for inspiration for your own ideas there are no detailed instructions to make particular items. There is some detailed information about making flower swags and ropes not found in a lot of books. I would not say this a book for a beginner it might be a bit intimidating but it's a great companion book anyone who wants to be creative.
5,The best so far.,"I found these to be the tastiest ones I have bought so far. I will say that the cans I received did not have exactly the same lable as pictured. The ones I received said Brislings, but they are delicious. I bought an expensive can of Crown Prince after I bought these and I could hardly eat them after enjoying these great Season sardines."
5,Fine quality,I've purchased Season Brisling sardines for many years after my brother produced an animated TV commercial for themand to date I have never been disappointed. My choice is the Olive Oil (as opposed to water) packed sardines. These come from the cold waters of Norway.
3,NORWAY OR SCOTLAND ; SALT/SODIUM IS HIGH,"ARE THESE SARDINES FROM NORWAY OR SCOTLAND ??????????

1,The spray doesn't work,"It is the second time that I purchase a perfume product from Amazon.com and something is not working. This time I cannot even use the spray, because it doesn't function. I wonder if it is genuine at all."
1,does not have a smell,I bought this from Fragrancenet. Good thing that I bought 1.7 oz version. It has almost NO SMELL. Must have been waiting in the shelf long time. Wish there was a way to know the production date of parfumes.
4,seems to work just fine,"seems to work just fine, do the job on my Panasonic 55ST30M for the analogue inputs on the side.No noticeable video loss."
3,A good reference guide,I recommend this book by Justin to gain greater insights in the Music business or any business. It was a great buy along with a couple of manuals I purchased from Musicbrains.net entitled the Indie label Kit on Amazon.
5,The One Book You Need,"I love this book. Its my main source for info on what I need to do to get my stuff out. There is nothing that compares to it. Its filled with page after of page of great ideas, models and concepts. And -- on top of all that -- its an engaging, fun read. Thanks, Justin."
5,One of The Best If Not THE best Out There,"This book by Justin Goldberg is one of the best books on the independent music and the music industry out there. This book is head and shoulders above the competition. What makes this book so great is that is broken down into chapters of important aspects of the industry and most importantly each chapter contains numerous interviews from industry executives about their thoughts and experiences on the subject. Only aperson as well connected as Goldberg could have gathered and harnessed this much knowledge in one book. Just when you think this book can't get any better it has a CD Rom included with it. The CD ROM is a database of music contacts that is unparalleled. Any contact you need in the music industry is on that CD Rom. The CD ROM itself is worth $15.00. To me it was like buying the database and getting the book for free. If you can just afford to buy one book on this subject, this should be the one!"
5,WOW Jim Widner does ride again!,"Not since Maynard Ferguson's ""Live at Jimmy's"" have I heard a recorded live performance of a big band with the level of excitment and musical excellance as I have with Jim Widner's newest CD. The arraingements are great, the band is red hot and crowd sounds ready to riot. You can feel the excitment building between the audiance and the band and then explode through the soloists. This is a must CD for every big band lover."
5,Don't Even Think About Selling Until You've Read this Book,I give this book six stars! Most selling books tell you how to help your prospects or customers and in result you close a sale. Zero Resistance Selling goes beyond that and shows you how to help yourself by improving your self-image. Doing so creates an environment that is non-resistant both for you and your prospect.It is full of excellent tips for handling pressure and getting rid of fear. This is powerful powerful stuff! Read this book not once but twice and make it part of your thinking. I promise you that you will see immediate results not only in your sales but in your life as well!I highly recommend it!
4,An overview of Sales,"This book wont show you how to make sales. It will help you analyze why you are not selling. Its an extension of Psycho-cybernetics, and if you read that book, the material is basically the same. If I had a choice between Psycho-cybernetics and this book; I'd purchase Psycho-cybernetics."
3,Pretty basic but a good review book to have in the library,After starting my new phone sales job. I realized I needed to brush up on my skills and mental schema. I first purchased Zero Resistance Selling to give me a clear view of my mentality in selling. This book from the beginning to the end is definitely an eye opener. A combination of both sales skill sets and self development that gives an edge to how you approach your job and clients. This book is highly highly needed to be ready by all sales professionals and should be at the top of the list of what to read.
4,These headphones work fine.,I can't figure out why anyone could rate these earphones poorly.They are an good upgrade to the Ipod included earphones for less money. Stop being so fussy.
1,i wish i had a cat,"i wish, like another reviewer, that i had a cat to eat these earbuds. i purchased these earbuds because i needed a quick fix for an upcoming trip and hoped that the sennheiser name would translate into quality. what a disappointment. these earbuds tinny, uncomfortable, and worth every penny you spend. they ARE $11.99 headphones. if you love warmth, bass, clear highs, and definable mids, look elsewhere and be prepared to pay more. take it from me, it's money well spent. of course if listening to music through a tin can is your thing, buy these babies."
2,SHORT: Look elsewhere...,"I do not like Sennheiser MX-450.I do not like the fact that they sound bleak and tiny, the bass is miniscule, highs are so so and definetely too much presense or 1KHz range... If you turned to Senhheiser hoping to get great sounding heapdhones in a ear bud package looks elswhere... I give them two stars just because they are not soooo bad, just not at quality level you would expect from a brand like Sennheiser...Check out AKG K14P (but not its sibling K12P) instead. They may be harder to find but cost under $20 and as opposed to Sennheisers do not sound ""tiny"". Actually for a headphones that size they sound incredible with good balance of dynamics, clarity and bass response.They also, like Senhheisers, come from a premier headphone manufacturer. Unlike Sennheisers, however, they live up to expectations...Hope this review helps others, I spent over $60 looking for a pair of decent earbuds and I do not think you have to repeat that eperience."
3,"[ c'mon amazon, where's my 3.5 stars option? ]","House no misconceptions: these are cheap earbuds, and aren't going to give you the sort of surprising sound Sennheiser's PX-100 headphones do. They are, however, a good bit crisper than standard-issue iEarbuds, and don't smother the signal with bass.The cord is a bit shorter than a standalone cord should be, and slightly too long for most plug-in remotes, but it's not a grave design flaw.These are workhorse headphones, best for travel or gym-ish activities. Along those lines, you could do plenty worse for $15."
3,"Sound reproduction above average, but seal is lacking","I've tried Sony earbuds that are exactly like these Sennheisers. The sound quality is pretty similar between the two, the only difference being the Sony tips are not circular: they are crafted to provide a tighter fit in your ear. That little bit actually makes quite a large difference, as the bass and treble in the Sonys sounded better than the Sennheisers, whereas the real difference was how much tighter the seal you could make with the Sonys. I'd have to say either way though, if you're just looking for something small to boot around, you're definently getting your money's worth. I needed something with a little more presence and a better sound stage, so I upgraded to the Etymotic ER6i Isolator in ear monitors.This isn't to say Sennheiser doesn't make good headphones: I own a pair of EH150s, and they are really nice with amp."
3,"OK product, but won't buy it again.",This moisturizer does not give you any greasy feeling but the odor is somewhat unpleasant. Also I have not seen any anti-aging effect after using it for almost 2 months.
5,Finally... I found one!!!,"I think this is the only book on Foreign Medical Schools... at least I couldn't find any other titles. Anyway, good info on foreign med schools for poor souls like me... if you wanna be a doctor, but your only option is going abroad... then get this book."
3,Good if looking at the Caribean,This was an ok book if you are just starting to look at Car. schools. If you are just starting it is a for sure good buy. If you have received the school packet from any of these it isn't really worth it.
1,"In plain English ""it's worthless""",This book simply takes a few foreign medical school web pages and prints them out for you. All the information can be found already on the internet for FREE! don't waste your money like I did! Unless of corse you'd like to buy my book:)
5,&#65279;Starting Over,"&#65279;Teen romances are seldom considered great literature. But, they do serve a purpose. They provide characters who echo the everyday questions and insecurities that plague budding relationships. The problems Keith faces are problems faced by many young people. He moves to a new town and enters a new school. He is far away from his best friend. And, he is falling in love with another boy in the theater group. The interesting thing about this book and its sequel, ""Lucky in Love,"" is that it portrays prejudice as a very human thing. The homophobia exhibited in the book arises from the jealousy of the heterosexual characters. This book fills a void felt by many of us by giving back the dignity of romance."
3,A sweet but predictable novel of young love,"Sakers does a nice job of mixing the boy-boy romance with the quotidian aspects of high school life. The characterizations are uneven, and the attempts at humor are often strained, but for a 12 to 15 year old, this is a passable read."
2,Just because it's gay fiction...,"...doesn't mean that this book can get away with a high rating! In my continuous search for romantic, well-written alternative fiction, Act Well Your Part was yet another let-down. The mediocre writing left me thinking I had read much smoother and detailed works online. The relationship between the boys was perhaps realistic, but highly under-developed. The characters were flat, and the high school they attended was unbelievably liberal, especially for the 80's.In short, this is a quick story with a couple cute moments, but marred by noticeably bad writing and sickeningly cheesy scenes."
4,"I agree, something is lacking",The performance is excellent but I agree with the previous review that the mix is lacking. It's not horrible but I would expect more from a Japanese mastered release.
4,Approach with caution...,"Made in JAP in 2004, Serial# VICP-62914, Playing Time 40:26Recorded almost 20 years ago, this disc focuses on performances from the ""Final Countdown"" album (7 out of 9 songs).Taken from a performance recorded in Japan (the video released back in 1987 was recorded at London's Hammersmith Odeon), the present disc should only be of interest to die-hard fans...The packaging contains no info, no pictures, no liner notes; at 1980 yens, what else can you expect? This release was to be used as a platform to promote their upcoming Japanese tour.John Norum's performance is exhilirating, and the rest of the band is in good form; however, the mix could have used more ""woomph"".Obviously not as polished as its studio counterpart, this release will fall into oblivion... strange considering those guys were once kings of the arena-rock genre!An enjoyable but out-dated musical experience."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book is a JOKE.This mindless compilation is as if to suggest that the reader has no comprehension of fundamentals or is innately lacking.""Work well and play with others?""This publication just goes to show you that just about anybody can fill pages with asundered text from who knows what source for certain, publish it and call it a book."
2,"Do not, I repeat, Do not but this reel for 750 dollars","Paying nearly 800 dollars for this is downright sinful. There is no possible way anyone should waste that type of money on a bait casting reel. Perhaps if you were out fighting world class tuna and marlin this would be a price to pay, but for the type of fishing this is made for, 750 dollars is robbery.I've had calcuttas before and have owned this one, but only paid 175 dollars for it. Seeing this on here for 750 dollars makes me a bit upset.Sure Calcutta is a wonderful reel and is one of the best bait casting reels on the market, but 750 bucks? Gimmee a break.There are other Calcuttas on this site in the 170-200 range that are just as good as this reel. I smell a scam in the making here, so don't get robbed, go find a cheaper reel."
4,good but,"This is a quality dispenser, but the $30 price tag seems very high. Also, it is NOT watertight, if that is important to you, you might want to consider other product.I'd recommend the RSVP Endurance stainless steel honey dispenser."
2,It Leaks,"I read the reviews and was sure that I'd found the perfect honey dispenser. But, after a while, it leaks. They all leak. I am stuck (no pun intended) with a honey ring on my counter.The flaw is at the back of the spout. The cut off cover does not reach the back... and so the honey drips out."
5,Great Product!,"We love this dispenser for coffee creamer. After searching (and returning) several products from other companies, we found our solution in this dispenser. The only improvement I could suggest is make it a little bigger. Other than that, it's perfect."
1,High maintenance and leaks constantly with real maple syrup,"After spending this much for a syrup dispenser, you'd think it would perform well over time. I've had it now for almost a year and am looking for a new one. We used the dispenser for real Vermont maple syrup, so I can't attest to its performance with honey or artificial maple syrup. The first month or so was fine, then the leaking starts, which will then prompt you to have to dump out the syrup, clean the interior, make sure the gasket is in properly etc. and then after a week, you will have to start the process all over again. I wound up having to put the dispenser in its own saucer because of the incessant leaking. Had this cost $10 I probably wouldn't have bothered to write a review, but it is ridiculous that at this price something that is supposed to be utilitarian requires such maintenance."
2,Why does it spill?,This dispenser looks great and worked for about 6 months without spilling. Now it leaks despite my best efforts to clean the dispenser and keep the washer in good shape. Not worth the hassles I am afraid.
3,So wanted to love but still not quite right,"Great looking and nearly right, but the rubber ring inside is very easily dislodged (there are only modest metal tabs to hold it in place so it falls down often). As a result, it is difficult to get a tight fit between the top and bottom pieces of the dispenser."
5,Finally!,"After nearly a million years of human evolution (or 6000 years if you are a conservative evangelical Christian), there is finally a honey dispenser that works. Trouble free, works as advertised, enjoyable to use. No more sticky messes in the cupboard."
4,Syrup dispenser,"We had been looking for a good syrup dispenser for years and finally found this one. The seal works, it doesn't leak and the spout works great without dribbling. It is easy to take the top on and off so you can heat up the syrup in the microwave. We have been very happy with it so far."
2,Leaks,"This worked great a first, but after a couple washes and refills it started leaking, bad. Now there is a constant stream of honey down the front and a honey ring everywhere I set it."
2,Big disappointment,"This dispenser worked great initially. But most of the time, it would eventually get a little bit of honey stuck to the top, after which the honey being poured would stick to the honey on the top. No matter how much I cleaned it, the top would eventually get gunky and start dripping down the side."
5,Wonderful product!,This dispenser really works. For the first time ever I can pour honey on my cereal without making a mess. I highly highly recommend it.
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Boring, boring, boring, snore, snore, boring, boring, snore, snore.I didn't even finish the book. I tried and tried, I promise that I did. It wasn't that the writing didn't show real talent. The book is well written, it is just boring, boring, boring. Did I mention that the book was boring? I really wanted to like the book. There were times when I thought, this isn't so bad. Finally more than a month passed and I realized that I hadn't touched the book. Usually I can't wait to get home from work to read ""just one more chapter"" of the book that I am reading. This didn't happen with Mail. I couldn't care less about what ended up happening with the characters. I just ended up forgetting to read it. I have had more fun waiting for my own mail to arrive."
2,What a twit...,"For a first novel, it's probably semi- autobiographic. I was hoping that this book will be different. Katinka is a dim-witted and neurotic twit, deserving both Seamus and Jake. This is a sad statement of our society when we cheer for a character like that as if we feel guilty of a better life than hers."
3,Genre Fiction- It is what it is,"I would certainly classify this novel as genre fiction- A Romantic Comedy. As with all genre fiction, it is what it is. You either like it or you don't. But you can't try to analyze it into something that it's not. If you try, you'll only be disappointed. My advice with this novel is to enjoy it for what it is- a nice romantic comedy. You can try to break it down in terms of whatever literary concept suits you, but that might be unfair to the author and the book. After all, would you analyze something more literary from a genre fiction perspective? Never. So why try to analyze this from a literary perspective? It's a very light read and thoroughly enjoyable when absorbed from the right perspective."
3,"A little slow going, but worthwhile","I love the premise of this novel and I enjoyed the characters. I did, however, find the novel a little slow going at times. But I honestly cared about Katinka and the people in her life and I wanted to find out what happened in the end. The best thing about the book is it's non-happily-ever-after ending. The book reads like a slice of life, ending with the open-endedness that life always has until it's over. I especially enjoyed Katinka's relationship with her mother (i can certainly relate) as well as her falling in love with little Max (what a cutie).I would have liked to have given this book 3.5 stars but unfortunately that wasn't an option. I recommend this book if you are looking for well-written, well-developed characters in a charming setting but aren't in need of fast-paced action."
3,Could have been better,"This book was well-written for the most part, but Katinka was a little hard for me to like. Here she is, an intelligent woman, and could she be a little more promiscuous? I thought that this book was enjoyable to a degree, but that the plot just lacked something and wasn't exactly gripping. It's not a bad book, and some parts were very enjoyable, especially those sections involving the adorable Max."
3,The postman only rang twice,"--and Katinka puts new sheets on her bed. For a 31-year-old divorcee, this lady sure is empty-headed. No wonder she cannot write fiction unless she lived through it. Could it be that the author went along the same track? The only highlight is Max, probably because he is not a grownup. Cityslickers like Jake should never try to live in the country; they'll scream at the first earthworm they see. And Louie is right in sticking to stamps in Cambridge."
5,"Amusing Romp Thru Cambridge, & Frustrated Relationships..","This is a very funny 1st person Ivy League tour through love, lust, academia, literary attempts, mother-daughter feelings, friendships, all told at a breakneck speed, with great humor, and laughs thrown in for good measure! The apartment scenes in the Harvard neighborhood were great, as well as the dining (IHOP, especailly) and general descriptions. Worth a few fun hours! But are there really schools which ""teach"" 8 year old boys about parenthood by making him carry a sack of flour? Maybe, but a strange way to teach! Also, the infatuation with the mailman never really rang true to this jaded reader, but all is fair in love and war! And the ending seemed a bit unfocused, but probably still realistic. Perfect for a sequel!"
2,Big Disappointment,"Despite the review in the NY Times which prompted me to rush forward and pay hardcover bucks for a first novel by someone I'd never heard of, I'm disappointed to say that MAIL is absolutely ordinary. The characters are barely two-dimensional...the only authentic ones are an 8-year old boy and a bag of flour named Daniella.The highest compliment I can ever give a book is to wish I had written it. The sad fact is that if I had written this one, I would have wished it were better."
1,Return to Sender,"I have to say, after recently reading a few other titles in the genre of ""thirtysomethings-trying-to-hold-a-career-while-searching-for-a-lifetime-partner"" (*Bridget Jones*, *Animal Husbandry*), that *Mail* stood as the least enjoyable. Exluding the fact that the characters are flat, the book is just not written with any lyricism. I mean, I didn't expect this to ressemble Joycean prose, but even in contemporary women's novels, I guess I still expect the writing to flow. The metaphors seem contrived, as did the humor. However, I didn't regret reading this for 2 reasons: it was fun to catch the Harvard locale references and I thought the author accurately captured the true feelings of a single, smart, childing-coveting woman who babysits a precocious, fun ""Max-type"" kid."
3,"Enjoyable, a little disjointed","I probably expected too much from this book and was disappointed. The book was, for the most part, enjoyable to read but there were many parts that didn't seem believable.It seemed the book ""floated"" along very slowly for the first 3/4 and then all of a sudden all of these things happened in the last part of the book. A lot of it just didn't seem likely and it seemed that a lot of the characters all of a sudden changed their viewpoints, personalities, etc.I did like the fact that the ending was not predictable. Random and unlikely, but not predictable. This would be a good summer read, but nothing memorable."
