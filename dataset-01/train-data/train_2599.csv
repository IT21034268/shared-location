5,Just What I needed,"Gospel, old time with alot of soul. Especially like Amazing Grace version. My first gospel type CD, plan to buy another. This music is one of a kind."
4,Another uplifting piece of music,This was bought as a gift for a friend of mine who plays guitar and sings spirituals. He loves it and listens to it to lift his spirits!
4,Gospel music even a foxhole atheist can dig,"Yeah, that's right, I'm an atheist and a secular humanist. But I dig great music, period. And this is some rockin' sockin' gospel music, given a real nitty-gritty bluesy edge by the backup musicians. Their cover of Tom Waits' ""Way Down in the Hole"" is one of my favorite tracks of all-time in any genre (if you watched season one of ""The Wire"" you'll recognize it as the theme song). No need to believe in supernatural deities, folks - just believe in the power of the music to move a funky carbon-based life form."
4,Really good stuff,"This CD is excellent from beginning to end. I listened as I drove to the beach one rainy afternoon, and found myself singing along. The Amazing Grace/House of the Rising Sun song is SO GREAT."
1,Nothing 360 about this,I was extremely disappointed in this. First I thought it would project a 360 line around the room - It does not.I found it to be hard to use & almost worthless.
1,Came with dead cell,Bought from Amazon market place and the unit arrived with a dead cell. Never worked.
4,works well,"can't complain, it does the job, and was very inexpensive....though the ball configuration isn't' the best, i like a linear setup better"
4,Cute!!,"I bought this for my 2yr old thinking she would love it. I think my 8 and 10 yr old watch it more, its funny they say they are putting it on for their little sister but they watch it and my 2 yr old doesn't stay interested in it. I think she will like it one day, she does love seeing the characters at Sesame Place and when we see Sesame Street Live, but she is just really into Barney right now. Everything has to be Barney. I did think it was a cute video and if you are an Elmo fan and Abby Cadabby you'll love it."
4,My son likes it!,"My son is too young to really know what is going on in the show, but as a fan myself, I though Elmo's Christmas Countdown was pretty cute although I wasn't a fan of some of the musical talents such as Sheryl Crowe or Jennifer Hudson. Their music just seemed kind of ""off"". I enjoyed Alicia Keys performance and the Bert and Ernie skit. I also wasn't a fan of Kevin James as Santa....more so him singing.I really liked the story and I liked Stiller the Elf and my son seemed to enjoy it! That's all that matters!"
1,Cute but sends a bad message to kids...,"This movie is cute... most of the cameos & songs are good. I don't like some of the dialogue. A couple of times during the movie a character starts talking about the ""elfin' menace"".... Its sounds like hes saying ""f-in menace"". Another character says something like ""not having a snowballs chance in..."" & another character pipes in & says something before the character says ""hell"". Some parents might not care if their kids talk trashy but I do. Its a shame because if they had left out those comments it would definitely be a keeper."
4,"VERY GOOD, BUT COULD BE BETTER...","The story is very good, but my 4 y/o child and I can't give it the 5 stars.The main audience of this story is supposed to be young children... some jokes, in my opinion, are waaaayyy tooo complicated for the kiddos. I don't like this ""revolutionary"" idea of a Santa who likes rock... the rocker Santa was *not* silly; rather, he was simply corny... and it was supposed to be one of the magical moments of the story. something can be funny and still magical.... but that santa?...hmmmm, nop.Don't get me wrong, the story is very good and my child liked it (let's say that is lacking something.... it's just not having the feeling of a classic Christmas story)... but overall, it's OK. I specially liked seeing so many American celebrities singing so many wonderful songs for the story... but the end is totally messed up... they did a good job putting everything together, so I'll give it 4 stars."
3,Just okay... my son is not impressed,"I am the parent of a Two year old ELMO-holic... we now have an extensive DVD collection of this little red monster.This is not one of my son's favorites.. it's drawn out and not very entertaining. However, he really enjoys the Elmo's World - Happy Holidays DVD. I would recommend it over this Christmas Countdown."
5,An excellent Elmo Christmas movie,"This is by far better than the other elmo Xmas movie which we hated and gave one star and highly suggest you avoid. This is however the opposite. It's slightly different then the usual elmo progression which is very nice. It has Abby Cadabby in it as elmo's co-star and has quite a few Christmas songs woven into the story of them trying to save Christmas. They just need to wish upon a Christmas star and have a little faith, which elmo does. The story line is great, the colors and mood are extremely festive. The singers and song choices are excellent. I would say it's probably one of the best kid Christmas dvd's you can get that they, or even you for that matter, will enjoy again and again."
5,2 year old daughter LOVES this movie!,"My daughter is 2 years old and is huge Abby and Elmo fan!! She loves Seaseme Street and will actually sit still while watching this movie. The cast is great and it holds my child's interest. My 6 year old son also likes this movie.If your child loves Sesame Street, they will love Elmo's Christmas Countdown!"
5,a new christmas classic,we watched this video with our son and we all loved it. It helped usher in the Christmas spirit and the guest cast is wonderful. Very entertaining.
5,Great video,This is a great dvd. Even the adults in the house loved watching this movie. My daughter has a collection of Elmo movies. We intially checked this dvd out of the library but she would not let me return it so I had to buy one.
4,Great Movie for Elmo Lovers of Any Age,Elmo is always fun to watch and my grandkids (and I) enjoy him.I'm happy to make this movie part of our Christmas Eve movie celebration.
4,Cute story,This is a cute christmas movies for both kids and adults. There is the learning for kids and also adult jokes.
2,"I love it, but my 1 yr old does not","I think this is a great movie and I love the musical number by all of the famous people. However, my one year old could care less and Elmo doesnt have enough screen time for this to hold her attention."
5,The Man Who Fell,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345431618/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img This is a great book.I'm on the 10th chapter right now andit's wonderful. I saw David Bowie play the title role of,Thomas Jerome Newton, in the film adaptation of this book and I loved it so much that I just had to read the book. I haven't been disappointed.Thanks go out to the seller and once again Thanks go to Amazon for always making things better and easier to purchase!"
5,If I were on a desert island...,"Okay, this isn't the ONLY book I'd take, but definitely in the top 10. I read it long ago, initially because I was intrigued by the title. Upon completing it, I was speechless. There's so much substance in this book, and the message it presents couldn't be any more clear. The title is so appropriate, almost a joke on the author's part.It should truly be considered a science fiction classic, so it's hard for me to understand just why it's been out of print for so long... and even when it's back in print, why an overpriced trade edition? It's a shame when the shelves are cluttered with layer upon layer of alternate-history/nanotech/ cyberpunk/shoot-em-up crud, but books like this are dismissed. It's no wonder that the field is so often dismissed with a scoff. Read this book and see that science fiction can have a worthwhile message."
2,Good 'till the End,"Walter Tevis does a good job on this Sf book. I especially enjoyed the concept of an alien from a devistated world trying to save his people from extinction. The alien's (for we don't know his real name) assumed name is Thomas Jerome Newton, who is apperently a genious in science. He comes to Earth and sets up the World Enterprizes Corporation. W.E. Corp. is a pioneer in technological advancis. Newtons real plan on Earth is to build a space ship to ferry his people there. Their world is dying out from its wars. Eventually, Newton is caught and ends up a rich bum.In my opinion it was a good story till the end, where it becomes very sad. I think Tevis could have put a better ending on it. Overall, I do not reccomend this book except to those of you who love a bad ending."
4,Heard it by chance,"I heard what was most likely an abridged version of this book on tape during a ten hour drive from western New York to Indiana. I must admit I wasn't interested at first, but I was quickly drawn into the story. This excellent story made that trip the fastest ten hours of my life. I can't wait to read the unabridged book."
5,A captivating book.,"The Man Who Fell to Earth is one of my favorite books, as is The Queen's Gambit, also by Walter Tevis. I heartily recommend the book, but not the movie. As usual, key elements have been changed and the plot simplified. By the way, I painted a picture of T.J. Newton as an art assignment in high school. (And I, unlike the movie, gave him tan skin and white hair...)"
4,"GOOD BOOK, UNSATISFIED WITH ENDING.","I read this because I heard that David Bowie was in themovie. I enjoyed it even more because I pictured him as themain character. I identified with the character, and grewto ""love"" him during the course of the book. I won't ruin itby saying that it was a bad ending, because it wasn't, Ijust would have liked itto be different. If anyone wantsto see the movie, I suggest that you read the book first;it's easier to understand the movie once you have.Thanks,Alisin"
3,"Some parts good, some slow","Got this book for my son but read it myself. Very well written when describing the game. But while the background of the players is interesting, the book takes too much time in these areas and gets somewhat bogged down. Both my son and I enjoyed the book, but skipped through several of these parts.It's amazing to realize what these players accomplished and how liitle known their feat is."
4,Wonderful story of the greatest US sports upset ever,"In the 1950 World Cup, the United States fielded a team of scrappy immigrants' sons which the world refused to take seriously. Three games later, respect had been gained. The U.S. had defeated England, the land where soccer was born, in the most shocking upset in World Cup history, 1 goal to none.Far beyond a story of a sporting journey to Brazil in 1950, The Game of Their Lives offers a glimpse into the lives of eleven elegantly simple Americans. Centering on 50's St. Louis, then the soccer capital of the U.S., these men recount life growing up as a first-generation American. This inspiring tale is a humbling read in the face of the millions pro athletes make today. There was a time when the sheer thrill of victory and the honor of playing for your country was pay enough.Douglas recaptures an inspiration created 47 years ago and immortalizes it for all in the pages of this book. A must-read for any U.S. soccer fan."
1,Avoid this brand - magnets easily break-off!,"I bought several of these taller defectors - for the over-sized (tall) wall registers in my old home. I'd bought some from Deflecto several years back that have worked well but slowly broke from the kids/things banging into them. Unfortunately, Deflecto doesn't seem to make the tall version anymore so I bought these instead - BIG MISTAKE! These use a type of vinyl magnet (like fridge magnet material) that slides onto the edge of the deflector. Unfortunately these magnets tear and separate from the deflector - with seemingly the slightest bumping or movement. Of the 4 I installed - three were useless within a month. I'll just have to use the not-as-tall (but better made) Deflecto models next time. Sure wish they'd make the tall ones again!"
5,Grandpa made his granson's day.,The day before Christmas I set up his bedroom with Thomas The Train stuff.He is a typical little boy. Trains N Trucks! It was easy to put up as well.
4,Pretty nice,Hard to match up as it does come in 2 pieces and is very sticky....but overall it is very nice. We were not able to match it up 100% but my 2yr old son doesn't mind...you cant notice unless you get really close to it. Looks great in his room.
3,It's OK,"This came in 2 pieces. All except a few inches from the top was on one piece. The pieces didn't match. One was significantly shorter length wise than the other. We had to stretch it a lot to make it almost line up. The installation was difficult because of this. It looks ok on the wall after the stretching, but still doesn't match up perfectly. I'm sure my son does not care, but it bothers me."
4,Super Easy,I bought this for my son's room and was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to put on the wall. I removed and repositioned several times while positioning where I wanted it without damanging the newly painted wall.I would definately recommend this product for anyone who wants an failsafe way to add a little decoration to a room.
2,Overpriced package,"While there are a few new things in this book, there is no call to take a $50 book, put it in a $100 box, and expect good reviews. Instead buy Ferrari P3/412P by Huet and Carrieri, Ferrari P 1961-1973 by Cassuci, or the simple paperback Ferrari 'P' Series by Beehl. Marasca's book would be an excellent buy in ordinary hardback at a reasonable price. I kept a copy simply because of a replica under construction."
5,understanding psychotherapy,"I have read and reread this book. If you are in therapy or or thinking of therapy it is absolutly the best book to read. Any confusion about your own therapy will be mentioned in some way in this book. It helps to clear your own mind and look at yourself in a productive way, realising that no matter how hard therapy is there is a reason for everything a therapist does. The book gives comfort when dealing with difficult issues as you might see yourself in one of his patients and realise that your own therapist is like Dr. Basch and doing what is best for you and totally on your side, eager to help you. It is a fantastic book, and I have never ever read a better book on psychotherapy. Thank you Dr. Basch."
4,Review of Doing Psychotherapy by Basch,"This book is readable, astute and extremely well written. In the text, Basch has clearly illustrated the application of the psychoanalytic approach to therapy. Although Basch, at times, uses extensive psychological jargon, students in the field should not have trouble following along. Doing Psychotherapy is a useful reference book for any psychologist or student in the field planning on this line of work."
1,False advertisement,"Do not use this seller. You'll pay for a new book and then they don't even send you the cover to the ""new"" book. They're also unresponsive when you contact them. It's not worth paying their cheap price, spend $1 more and get way more."
4,Nice Comeback for Haddix,"I am a 5th grade teacher and read the ""Shadow Children"" series aloud to my class each year. I was pretty disappointed with Among the Brave as I felt the author spent far too much time retelling the story of the earlier books. Among the Enemy was riveting. It began very strong and the momentum never dissipated. The main character of the story has shifted once again, to Matthias (one of the kids first encountered in Among the Imposters) and it also takes a noticeably spiritual turn. I was ready to be disappointed again, but Ms. Haddix did a fine job of storytelling with this one. It is a fine series to read when a class is studying civil rights, the Constitution, or for older kids ecology, and childbirth policies in this country and others. I'm eager to read the next in the series, whenever that may be."
4,I'm definately not disappointed!,"For fans of the books, I think you'll agree with me. I wouldn't say it's my favorite of the series, but it's definately up there. When I read ""Among the Betrayed,"" I was REALLY interested in learning more about Matthias, Percy, and Alia.... I got my wish! It has practically not-stop adventure, plot twists, and at least one part that'll leave you thinking ""Why didn't I figure that out?"" I love it when books do that! Anyway, buy this book!"
5,Cool Book,"Are you the third child in the family? If you are you should read this book. Matthew, Percy and Alia were sleeping when someone knocked on the door. It was the police Matthew, Percy and Alia were taken by the police. Will they escepe from the evil country? Find out in this book and what happens to Matthew, Percy and Alia. Recommended for the third child in the family. Read it now! by Anthony"
4,books for young people,"liked this book because they are good clean stories,that don,t make you think to much, takes your mind off the things in real life and make you see this life isn,t so bad."
3,Great book for the mind,Mathias is an illegal third child fighting for rights to be free. Without thinking he saves a population police officer his enemy. Matthias goes to population police head quarters to be an officer because he doesn't want to blow his cover and put others in danger. There he meets Nina another third child. Both of them plot a plan to escape headquarters and defeat population police. I love how the book puts a picture in your mind and how detailed it is. This is a good for every body that can read.
4,What else could go wrong?,"Matthias' school was taken by the Population Police and all he wants to do is get himself and his friends to safety. They get away from the Population Police but Matthias friends get some injuries so he went to go get help. They got back to where the two friends were staying and found them missing. Matthias then got into the Population Police and became good friends with the commander. At the same time, he is in a group that is planning a rebellion against the government. He then had some choices and major roles in the plan.I liked this book because there was always something happening that you wasn't expecting. Everything else was amazing.This book is for someone who likes action in their books and enjoyed the other books in this series. Anyone who is an all right reader can read these books."
5,great book,"This book was great. Among the Enemy is one of my favorite books. I bought it at a book fair at my school. When I saw it, I thought it looked pretty good. I was wrong. It was really good. If you don't have Among the Enemy by Margaret Peterson Haddix buy it."
4,It looks to be a very good addtion.,I have read all of the other books in the seris this promises to be another good book i hope. From the hints i got for Zmoung the brave this book will be about the main cast and some new charcters. Many of them being third childern. They are signing up to be in the population police to work as double agents. Asueing ou read the last book things are real bad a new govrement has taken over putting the population police in full control. Things are worse than ever and man third children may be found out. I hope this to be another very supensful fold in the shadow children sequance.
3,Decent effort,"This CD's best songs have been played to death already on the radio stations. ""Music"" and ""I'm Hot"" are two great songs. However, without his partner, Erick lacks that extra something...He sampled too much from the old school and that's not leaving a good taste in my mouth. I'm getting sick of hearing these old 70s sampled songs. Where is the new stuff? ""Up them thangs"" is a high energy song, which brought back ""Headbanger"" memories for a second. In the end, I liked 4 out of 11 songs. Which is less than 50%, but I'll give it 3 stars because the songs that I like are pretty cool."
3,A book for Advanced Engineers,"As a student of the author, in which the book is used in a grad level engineering school, this book summarizes all that is learned in an under grad engineering college. Many mathematical aspects are considered from simple algebraic logic to advanced Fourier transforms. This book covers it all. In summary, this book is great to own if you are interested in combining all what is learned in mathematics to solve complex problems."
5,Instant classic,"I'm a big loyal fan of freestyle music so I can't really say that there are that many bad songs out there. Still, this song has to be ranked among the best of freestyle. Bonafide freestyle hit nowaday comes far and few in between and this one is it. The song clearly stands out even for a first time listener. The beat is simply irresistible. Everytimes I hear it the song got stuck in my head for hours afterward. I also thought Jossette did a very good job not just singing but also expressing the song. IMO, she's not that far from the top tier of freestyle singers. Way to go, Jossette!"
3,"Good energy, lacking in other areas","This is sort of a Maynard Ferguson tribute band. It is more like MF in his final days rather than MF in his prime. There is a lot of energy and excitement, but the band is not clean and they are frequently out of tune. I'm not sure why they would want to double the lead trumpet part which resulted in intonation problems. I was impressed with the work of Chad Shoopman, although his abilities are not sufficiently exposed. The lead trombone player also does a nice job and there are some nice solos from the band. If you are a fan of MF and are looking for more of the same you might want to check this out."
5,Most underrated album by a mile,"The reviewer that mentioned his difficulty listening to JT's greatest hits gives a very apt description of FLAG, an album that truly shaped my exploration of music. There's very little in JT's catalog that I don't like, but I do take issue with a lot of his greatest hits. For the most part, they are such beautiful, catchy melodies (""ear-worms"") that they almost overwhelm the lyrics. On songs like Sweet Baby James and Fire & Rain, for example, James could have written lyrics about eating puppies and people might not have even noticed.FLAG has some great melodies, but they do not overwhelm the poignant, gut-wrenching lyrics of songs like Sleep Come Free Me, Johnnie Comes Back, and Millworker -- songs that reveal universal truths about the human experience. FLAG is not ""easy listening."" It's something far better -- more like a Masters' Class in songwriting for the advanced listener. I thank my dad for playing that album when I was a teenager."
2,Why did I listen to this?,"James Taylor's ""Flag"" is an album like none of his others. The production on the album is somewhat muffled which can be both an enjoyable listening experience and a drag. It doesn't really carry itself like an album, rather, like a compilation of unreleased stuff. The album has a few good songs going for it, like, company man, johnnie come back, milworker and of course ""up on the roof"" but as I said there is no connection between these songs making this a somewhat trite listening experience. The cover of day tripper is disastorous and you will immediately want to skip it. Before reviewing, I listened to the album in it's entirity and honestly I bet in 1979 when people first bought the LP, they were probably very disappointed after waiting 2 years for an album. Truly this album is trash. all the good songs are attainable on other JT discs, so I suggest buying those."
5,"I agree with another reviewer here, this album isn't given enough credit!!!","James Taylor's flag seems to be one of those albums in an artists career that seems to have created a split within his fan base... I'm not really not sure why... compared to ""JT"" the instrumentation really isn't much different... James is taking more compositional risks here but I feel that the album still tracks well and is as enjoyable as any other James Taylor album... there's a lot of great material here for James Taylor fans... make certain you listen to the later part of the album... I think it tends to pick up steam... you shouldn't be dissapointed.."
3,There 2002 album,"As you can see I review alot of different styles of album most are with an unbiased appraoch.Top songs are Outlaws-""Do you remember""-Welcome to Flint-""Feds""-""Shadows"" a very dark beat.We kept it Ghetto-Young Thugs-""Weed Song"".There Flows are tight but there not talking about the same stuff 6 years ago(96)The quality of the production has increased on this album and if it were not for a couple of wack songs it would be amazing.Lyrics 4 Production 9 X Factor-8 Classic 8 Replay 7Total=7 out of 10 FingersTop 51.Shadows2.Do you remember3.Feds4.Weed Song5.Welcome to Flint-Note this is no where near F.B.I. this sounds like BTNH-3 6.-It would be smarter to buy F.B.I. if you were to compare"
4,Tight follow up to their last joint,"You wont be dissapointed in this record. I think FBI is the best rap CD ever made, and this isnt quite as good, but what could be? It's real, and its good."
3,Dope House Huslin,"I have never heard of this group b4, until some introduce me to this CD. My first listen, i stopped on the 3rd song because the production is great but the lyrics and the subject of their lyric is HORRIBLE. However, I gave it a second chance and listen to it again. Throughout the CD, the production is very SOLID, but the lyric did not sound any better, but however their lyric blend with the production after a couple listen. You will get use to that but it takes time. I never heard any of their old songs, but this CD here, I am already tired of what they are talkin bout, if you want to listen to something like that get TI, he has much more energy. But the production brings it up so this CD is okay.Lyrics: CDeliverY: CProduction: AOverall: B-"
2,Expected much more.,I found this book not conclusive enough for a first time programmer to build his first game. I expect a game programming book to talk alot about collision detection and setting up a game. This book did not have the resouces or content for a new game programmer to get a game up and running. It would be an ok book for a first time reader to get introduced to some of the elements of game programming but did not cover enough of the core elements such as collision detection. The book was easy to read (ledgeable)but was not extensive enough to build your first game (nor does it provide the resources).
4,Some of the Greatest,"The GREATEST horse stories EVER told? Well...let's put it this way. These are definitely some of the better stories, and certainly the book as a whole offers an eclectic and therefore engrossing range of stories. But don't hold the book's title against it. It really is a nice mix that ranges from the first-person accounts by Jane Smiley of her dear old friend Mr. T. and Colonel Alois Podhaksky's description of his time spent as the Director of the Vienna Spanish Riding School (home of the Lipizzaner stallions) to a story of a real life horse whisperer and Maxine's Kumin's thoughtful answer to the question, ""Why is it that girls love horses?"" Here too you will find racehorses, cow ponies, hunters and the people who know and care for them. This book is a sure beat for anyone who loves horses, or is interested in what makes those who love them tick."
4,the greatest horse stories ever told,the book arrived in short order and was in the stated condition. Have been reading it and enjoy the book.
4,2001 Latin Grammy Nominees,"This is an excellent album. I definetly reccomend it. I actually bought it when I was living in Ecuador for $1 as a copy, but I think I am going to buy a better version through Amazon.com. There is such a good variety of songs, and it will definetly get you moving. What is nice about this CD is that it is a good sample of Latin music in case you want look into buying more music by a particular artist. I will have to say my favorite song on the CD is track 2, ""El Album."" It is just such an interesting song with its Columbian folksong roots. I could listen to this CD over and over because of the variety and great sound. Definetly a good buy!!"
2,Written by NTs for NTs,"This book may be useful for someone who is a friend or family member of a person on the low-functioning end of AS. For Aspies themselves, however, it comes across as condescending and pitying; it refers to people with AS as 'childlike,' and is mostly written with that perspective. The author seems to have a lot of experience with how AS looks from the outside, but not a real understanding of how AS feels or how AS functions beyond the psychological/neurological theories of people without AS.There are a handful of social tips for people with AS scattered throughout the book. Some of them may be useful, but for anyone who has learned to cope on their own as an adult, and is looking for help beyond what they have achieved by themselves, there is unlikely to be anything new."
2,Solutions? What solutions!,"Made myself read the whole thing, looking for useful advice. Glad that's over with. Repetitive and longer than it needs to be, and mostly a waste of time."
4,Excellent resource,"I thought this was an excellent resource, and really helped me understand some of the things that I go through in my relationships. It gave thorough and positive examples. Unlike other books I have read relating to this topic, I feel like this one was much more helpful in the sense that it didn't constantly treat AS like a disease, as well as it gave valid examples, and encouragement. I read this without feeling 'broken' through the entire text.I would recommend this to anyone that's struggling with some of the relationship aspect things that can be a struggle for someone with AS, who is really hoping to find a sustainable, happy, and healthy relationship."
4,Overall - very good,"The author has captured the key issues affecting adults affected by Asperger's Syndrome (AS), both directly and indirectly. The author also spends a significant amount of time discussing the impact someone with AS can have on Neuro-Typical relationships in different settings, making this book equally useful for partners, colleagues etc.This book covers a broad gamut of topics and is a very complete in this sense. However, with the broad range of subjects covered, some are not given the depth I was hoping for. This aside though, for any adult who has been recently diagnosed with AS, or has a family member or colleague diagnosed with AS, this is a great book. For those with a good understanding of the condition and are looking for more detailed information, alternate titles might be a better option."
4,Very informative and helpful,"This book came packaged well and in very good condition as described. It is a resouceful book that sheds light on a lot of issues that people, and family members of people, with Aspergers Syndrome deal with in daily life."
5,Outstanding!! Could have been my biography!,This book is full of informative examples and valuable advice. My wife and I have thoroughly enjoyed reading it together. My Wife tells me it is as if somebody has observed our life and written a book about it.
1,Didn't meet our needs,I returned this book. I expected more solid suggestions and recommendations. It didn't meet our needs at all.
3,Grey's Season 4,The product itself was fine; I just wish the network had created more episodes in the season!
4,Strangely Enticing Still,"Seventeen episodes of relatively predictable fare if you've watched seasons 1-3 with a few new interesting characters and scenarios. However Grey's has never really been a plot driven show, more focusing on the original cast and their loves, mistakes, dramatic highs and lows, and interactions as they advance within SGH. The sad loss of Addison to her spinoff Private Practice and not so sad loss of Burke after his departure at the wedding are made up for with the return of a strong previously seen surgeon and a new junior member of the Grey clan. I watched all 17 episodes back-to-back which is great with no ads to keep you close to the action and I was hooked all over again. I don't believe in spoilers, so just to say existing fans won't be disappointed and it is worth catching up with Addison in Private Practice if this is your kind of show. Katherine Heigl is now the most watchable character, outshining Ellen and Patrick. As always, catchy but unobtrusive soundtrack."
1,the good stuff has ended,"I used to adore this show. Then they removed Kate Walsh and replaced her with the most horrid, I mean HORRID choice. Dr. Hahn is awful. I can't stand to watch the show anymore. And the borderline porn scene between Callie and McSteamy was as nauseating as anything I've ever seen.Really good shows can succeed and be fantastic without resorting to lowly scenes such as that one. I guess the writers have run out of juice.No longer a fan and won't bother to buy season 4 because I have no interest in reliving any of what I saw.And I agree with a the previous poster who said Dr. Bailey was the best character on the show. Dr. Bailey, Addison(why did she go?), and the Chief were my favs for sure! Also, I really think the show suffered after losing Burke. Too many dramatic changes I think."
5,My view,"This was an awesome fouth season, I enjoyed it very much.The purchase was very good and the shipping came beforethe due time which I really like."
5,greys anatomy,My daughter got hooked on this show over the summer last year and was able to catch up watching this on prime. All seasons are on it but the first season
5,It's Grey's Anatomy!,"So this is the 4th season of Grey's Anatomy. If you're thinking about buying this, you've probably seen a few of the previous seasons. If you liked those, you'll like this!"
3,Grey's Anatomy: The complete Fourth Season,Good article of a relatively very good quality but however I was deceived that the audio is only english as I would prefer to have it avalaible in french also.
5,Grey's Anatomy: The Complete 4th Season,"These DVDs were exactly as described. I was very pleased to receive my order earlier than expected. I've already watched the entire season once, and some episodes more than that. I'm really enjoying having one of my favorite shows at my fingertips to watch whenever I want.Thanks!!!"
5,Great service,excelent service fast and easy and product quality is great. It's not the first time I make a purchase with amazoand and it wont be the last and always have received the same quality service
4,Great Buy for Grey's Anatomy Fans,"This is the third time I've purchased this DVD series as a gift. For guys looking for a great gift for Fans of this show, it's an outstanding pick. The extra material such as the extended episodes, audio commentaries, unaired scenes and season outtakes will definitely make a Fan of Grey's anatomy happy. I only gave it a four because I'm not really a fan of Grey's Anatomy, but I know that the gift was well received."
3,Good,"For me this wasn't the best season. Only four episodes were my favorites, specially the season finale."
2,Poor Writing,This show is simply washed up. It's the writing that went bad. Everything else is okay but the writing is bad even in the new season. It's grown silly. What went wrong? Did the network demand more shows? More seasons? Wasn't it suppose to take place over a set period of time? You can only permit so many seasons in that case and that line has been clearly crossed. It's struggling for new plot lines and dumping new characters on the viewers for any reason to stay alive. It's grown as pathetic as Lost.
3,Packaging and inserts deplorable,"I received my new Grey's Anatomy in the mail. Imagine my disbelief in finding that there is no episode guide, other than a list of the titles for each episode. Also, the dvds fall out of the packaging. I paid 40 bucks and expected what was given in the past, I was sadly disappointed."
3,Pricy but good,"Since the writer's strike made the season quite a few episodes shorter than season's 2 and 3, I was disappointed with the fact that I paid the same price for this season. But, I'm addicted to this show and I bought it on impulse like I did with the rest of them when they came out. The last few episodes are by far the best, but throughout the season there were good moments. This season seemed to be mostly about Izzy and George though, and I wanted more Der-Mer in it."
3,Grey's worst season,"I am a serious fan of Grey's Anatomy, but this season was really bad. Everyone was flip flopping back and forth, saying one thing and doing another every episode. It did get better after the writer's strike ended, but the damage was done in my opinion. I hope Meredith and Derek figure it out. I'm glad George is getting some strength and confidence. Alex is just a head case in general and always will be, that is the only interesting thing about his character. Lexi and Meredith, OMG, this story line is really tedious. I want the old Grey's back. Here's hoping it is sexy and edgy and the characters start making better choices in their personal lives so we don't watch and think what a bunch of dumb-a%$#* they are. Oh, and did they change the name of the show to Steven's Anatomy?"
4,Trials & Tribulations of Hospital Life,"Poor izzie, Got not Emmy Material. Dr. Bones sure did. It what hospital in what world do they take Nurse's world against a doctors in sexuals harassment cases? Dreams on Baby. Only in Hollywood."
4,Great transaction!,The DVD's were in good condition and came in a timely manner. The only problem that I had is that the DVD's won't stay in the case. They don't attach correctly. Thanks
1,Long Since Jumped The Shark,"This season was absolutely brutal, as the show continues to sail headlong over the shark. It's become so utterly predictable and just plain bad, without even getting in to the whole ""Gizzy"" thing. No intent to flame the other reviewers here, but I'll just say that TV audiences (through the continuing ratings decline) and Katherine Heigl (comments re: not submitting her name for Emmy consideration) are both with me on this..."
2,scratched,The Season was shipped really fast but it was not like new and in good condition like it said one of the DVD was scratched really bad and skipped a whole scene
5,A must buy!!,I have bought all of the seasons of Grey's Anatomy. This one is a must buy too! I really recommend it!
4,It's Grey's Anatomy-what else is there to say?,"It is full of romance, drama, intensity, everything I would expect from Grey's Anatomy. What more is there to say?"
3,Not very good for a new DVD,So far I have watched the first 4 discs and every one of them has a problem changing to the next chapter. It freezes for about 5-10 seconds before it moves to the next chapter. A NEW disc should never have this problem.
2,Should have been cheaper!!,"Being a HUGE fan of this series, I am absolutely sickened that I payed $38. The last few episodes are good, but the rest is mostly replayed clips from the last shows, so don't torture yourselves watching any but the last few...and borrow it so you don't waste your money as so many of us have. Should have been priced accordingly.On a lighter note, I'm looking forward to watching the red heads new show, isn't it called Private Practice?"
5,Season 4 lives up to Grey's Reputation,"After what some fans thought of as a third season flop, Season 4 of Grey's Anatomy brought the show back together with new and exciting plot twists, along with closure of some of last seasons plots. It combines the exact right amount of surgical drama with drama between the staff, inside and outside of the walls of Seattle Grace Hospital. The season, along with the original cast, adds Lexi Grey, Meredith's estranged sister, to the cast as a surgical intern. Anyone who watches this show will not be able to stop. Trust me on this one."
5,Awesome!,"Grey's Anatomy season 4 has drama that will make you cry, comedy that'll have you rolling on the floor laughing. It's the perfect mix of all the best shows all in one. I reccomend this to everyone who enjoys a good cry and laugh while watching the same show!"
4,Gray's Anatomy - season 4,"Just finished watching season 4 of Gray's Anatomy. We did not get a chance to see this series when it originally aired, but my wife and I are enjoying it completely. What I thought was really neat about this set is the 'Season View' option for the discs. It keeps track of what you have watched as your progress through the discs. You can stop and start again, even remove the disc and watch something else. When you come back to the series it remembers exactly where you were when it was last viewed and starts from that point. VERY NEAT!"
2,Greys Anatomy Season 4,I purchaed for my daughter for easter. one of the DVD's does not work. Still looking for my reciept.. How can i exchange it?
3,Uneven season,"The season finale completely rescues this lost season. The main problem with this season is that the hookups and partner-swapping gets to ridiculous levels, almost as if the writers were trying to put people together until they figured out what worked. It had the feel of something like 90210, when they had no choice but playing rotating partners with the cast members.As a result, the romantic issues in the season became trite and annoying. However, like I said, the finale portends for better episodes to come, so let's hope that happens!"
3,Worthy of a purchase?,"As expected, season four of Grey's had a rocky running (along with countless prime time shows). Grey's tried to prove its worthiness as a successful series by bringing a large fan base into the fourth season. This season, however, was a test to the devotedness of its viewers. Grey's was a few short coming into their fourth season with the loss of Isaiah Washington's character--Dr. Preston Burke--and Kate Walsh's, Dr. Addison Montgomery. The show tried to compensate the loss by bringing in Burke's rival, Dr. Haun (played by Brooke Smith) and throwing in another twist to Meredith's life--Lexie Grey. This season's downfall was the entire first half (pre-strike), but admittedly got better as the season progressed. Is it worth the price? As a fan (and owner) of the first three seasons, I feel the need to complete the collection. Otherwise, I would invest in any prior season over this ""rocky"" one and hope that season five comes on a lot stronger."
3,$38?!,"Okay, I'm a Grey's Fanatic, and will undoubtedly purchase this to complete my collection, however, I am a little peeved that I'm paying $38 for such a short season. Season 1 only had 9 episodes, but at least the DVD was $19.99 instead of $38."
1,This game is horrible!,"This game was very difficult to play. Troop movements are near impossible because the soldiers are so small. Game play was very poor. It is basically the French version of Command and Conquer, but with very poor play characteristics. I would not recommend buying this game."
3,Use your imagination,"I'm not one to bad mouth a book. I know the authors do this to make a living. I read this book and own it. I'll probalby read it again eventually. It's a little lacking in the plot area, but if you use your imagination, as I did, it's not bad. Just remember it's a book geared toward young adults not adults out of college and in the work force. If you wanted a Alias book for that age group, you'll probably have to write one yourself. Just keep in mind who it's written for and you shouldn't have too many problems."
2,Not up to the standard,This was the most boring and formulaic of the Alias series so far. Just NOT up to the usual standard of easy reading fun with a few twists.
2,Slow,"The animation of the snakes was terrible, but if you're into SF then watch the movie, but it's not a movie you'll want to watch again."
2,a cliche movie with a lot of fake snakes,"This review contains spoilers, just fyi.Too many cliches for me. I almost turned it off when there was a sex scene in the first ten minutes, which is bad enough by itself, but guess what, they got eaten by snakes, which is weird, since snakes swallow their meals whole. And I think there was only one real snake in the whole movie, which is just wrong when you're making a movie where snakes as a species are one of the main characters. Way too many fake snakes, otherwise, a few bad actors, and too many cliches. Save yourself the time and whatever money you were considering putting into this movie, because it's not worth it."
2,making iron and steel: independent mills- - - - -,"This book is a gift for my son who is a Pgh. history buff so I have not read it myself and cannot give a review of its text. I did, however, find it very expensive for the type of book and the limited scope of subject. The paper product itself did not ""feel"" worth the cost and there was not even 1 visual of a mill discussed which would have enhanced the material. Needless to say, if it were not a book for my son, I would not have purchased it."
4,Baby,"The book Baby was one of the best books I have ever read. Although this book isn't very suspenseful there are some parts which contain some suspense. For example, throughout the first few chapters there is always a lady and her baby watching Larkin and her family. Later on in the book is when they find Sophie, the baby, on their porch. By finding this out, and reading the rest of the story, the ending was very predictable.The main character, Larkin, was a little irresponsible, but as the story went on, she took a lot of the responsiblitlity of Sophie and became responsible. If Larkin and her friend would not have found Sophie on her porch, the story wouldn't be as good. I really enjoyed this story and recommend it to anyone."
2,Baby,I thought this book was kind of sad when Sophie's mother left her on the island. The book was also a little nasty when it said that Byrd wore the same pair of underwear for ten months. It was a very slow book and did not get good until the end of the book. I would not recommend this book because I did not like it.
5,"great for teens, adults, and secondary teachers...","This book came highly reccomended to me from middle school teachers from across the country at a recent conference. I am a critical reader that is not easily impressed. The book had me in tears.On the surface, it is the story of Larkin and her family who live on an island frequented by vacationers in the summer and the baby, Sophie, who is left on their doorstep. Beneath this story, lies truths about the power of words and their ability to help us to heal from even the most horrific tragedy.As Sophie, a darling one-year-old, learns to speak, sing, and dance, the family learns to speak about the tragedy that shattered their lives. I read the first two chapters to my class of inner-city seventh-graders and had them clamoring to read the rest on their own. I read it to my seven-year-old son and he relished every moment.A perfect book....also beautifully written...like poetry..."
5,Beautifully written treasure to read with your child,"This is one of the most beautifully written children's books I have ever read. The story is a very emotional one that touches your heart. As a parent, I would recommend reading it with your child so that you can explain some of the meaning that may not be immediately evident to a young reader. Be sure to have a box of kleenex handy and Enjoy!"
4,Inside the book Baby,"BABYBaby is written by the author Patricia McLachlan, who has also written and won the Newberry Medal for Sarah, Plain and Tall in 1986. She has also written many other astonishing books including Baby and Sarah, Plain and Tall. Some of the books that I would recommend are Skylark and Journey.I would rate this book as a 4 because it can be sad and really good at the same time.People who enjoy reading Fantasy books will absolutely LOVE this book.Twelve-year-old Larkin (the main character) and her friend Lalo find a basket on the sidewalk with a note by it. The note tells them who the baby is and that they have to look after one-year-old Sophie until the mother comes back to get her. Sophie gets attached to her new family and will not let go. Larkin's father tells her not to get attached to Sophie and don't love her. Will she end up loving Sophie? Read the book to find out."
3,"A exelent book, fun to read.",Twelve-year-old Larken returns home one day to discover a baby in the driveway of her family's house.The only clue to the baby's appearance is a note. My favorite part is when the mother comes back to get Sophie & they're all speachlessto see the mother. I would recommend this to you if you LOVE babys. I wouldn't recommend this book if you love exitement
4,Baby by Patricia MacLachlan,"Larkin's life has always moved in rhythm with the sea and the wind, the coming and going of the island's summer people, the beat of her father's tap-dancing on the tiles. Mama and Papa and Byrd and Lark are accustomed to their routine, to each other. There's just that one thing they never talk about, the one with no name...At summer's end, one visitor remains behind after the last ferry has gone. Through taking Sophie into their home for the off-season, Lark and her family are enabled to relearn the balance of love and loss and letting go.In Baby, Patricia MacLachlan deftly portrays vulnerability not demeaned into weakness, tenderness not devolved into sentimentality, and woven throughout, the wondrous power of words."
5,"A beautiful, classic story","This is the first review I've ever written. I realized I needed to write a review for Baby. I first read this book in the fifth grade and it a book I still return to over a decade later. The story of Larkin and her family--some by blood and some by love--is touching and memorable. I cry every time I read the book, but I am always comforted by the story. The cast of characters is fantastic and colorful. I really cannot pick a favorite. I always want to find this island and move there. The book is very well-written, lyrical and clean.I highly recommend this book to readers of all ages."
2,Very Rare Recordings,"I Loved This CD//However I Was Hoping That The very RareVersion Of Rumania Rumania By Aaron Lebedeff Over 7 Minutes Long Was On This CD.This Version Is The Short One/I Have On An Old LP/So I'm Still LookingStanley CooperJupiter, Florida"
5,Filling in the gaps,"This book not only fills in the gaps on history it tells the story of how the gaps on our maps were filled in. From the wastelands of the Sahara to the northwest passage in Canada this book chronicles the adventures and misadventures of the men who dared to do the impossible. On Shoestring budgets these people went literally to the ends of the earth to fill in 'pointless' parts of the map. Yet without them we would never know what lurks in the extremes of our world. This is a grand tribute to English fortitude and daring the mapping of these savage areas had never been attempted or done before because no people, and no country had the guts to send men into such extremes of human endurance.Told as best it could be told, in flowing language this is a lovely account of human daring and folly."
5,An excellent adventure anthology,"""Barrow's Boys"" reads like an anthology collection of great exploration stories. From the darkest depths of Africa to the coldest reaches of the arctic, Barrow sent British naval officers in search of geographical truth for almost forty years. The stories of these expeditions are expertly told by Fleming, who adds to his narrative insightful commentary and a sense of humor. What is striking is just how many of these adventures ended in death and failure--with no deterrent effect! Anyone with an interest in the history of exploration will love this well written provacative book."
5,Crazy untold period in history,"Dunno, maybe a lot of people already knew about the British exploration to discover the Northwest Passage, but I never knew about it until I read this book. One incredible story of determination and lunacy after another... a must read for any arm-chair explorer. I have read a number of book by Fergus Fleming and always found his work enjoyable."
4,text book?,"Although I liked the book very much - I was looking to learn more about the expeditions and men involved than the general text book information which I felt I received. Although, I do understand that Barrow was a great leader of exploration and the years and experiences to be covered was many (and I had learned more of Barrow and his men), the book still seemed more like a text book than I was looking for."
5,An Extreme (Reading) Adventure About Extreme Adventurers,"For an exciting summer read there is none better than Barrow's Boys, the story of British explorers who left the shores of England under the auspices of the Admiralty to explore the Artic, the Antartic and parts of Africa. The book is both well written and well researched, and keeps the reader entrhalled with tales of 19th Century explorations by ""extreme adventurers"" to use the author's own phrase. And the reader will have to agree with part of the subtitle that some of the tales demonstrate ""outright lunacy"" on the part of the hero-explorers. This is a book that I did not want to end, and was sorry when I finished it and had to put it down. But the memories still linger, and the stories have made great conversation for many weeks now. I recommend it wholeheartedly to all book lovers."
1,Don't even think of buying Gericom in US,There is nowhere you can go for any repairing support in US. Gericom has forgotten all the customers who bought their products. They don't even provide the basic drivers when purcheasing.
3,Support,"Support for Gericom is done through Gericom department at IBM.If there is a problem with the laptop, they will fix or replace it. My problem is that there is no place in U.S. to buy additional components, ie. battery, for Gericom laptops. J&R or Amazon should address this issue if they are going to sell these laptops."
5,Valuable Aid to Religious Scholars,"Traditions about the Early Life of Abraham is a great collection of texts, documents, and translations pertaining to the life of Abraham. These things are presented in an unbiased way, though are obviously intended for an LDS audience, though the book should be interesting to any Christian, Jew, or Muslim, or a member of any Abrahamic faith or anyone who is interested in the life of the Prophet and Patriarch Abraham."
4,"Appealing characters, predictable storylines","Jay, Franny, Stevie, and Emerson became fast friends during their days at Princeton and have remained steadfast. Jay is married to Vivienne. Franny is still single wanting to find true love and have a baby desperately. Stevie has commitment issues since she never knew who her father was as a child. Emerson is a single mother faced with the needs and demands of her young daughter and dying mother. Franny helps Jay recover from a tragedy and Jay helps Franny with her dream. Stevie's mother one day decides to reveal who her father is. Stevie's father never questions it. Emerson discovers love for herself and not what her mother wants for her. The four main characters were genially written as people anyone could relate to. This novel is for you if you are looking for something easy to read with no surprises."
3,Got what I needed from it,"Took the plunge, figuring that if it didn't work out it still wasn't worth fighting for less than $4.00 (shipping included). Don't use that often, developed short about 6 months in. You get what you pay for. Next purchase will be from a different vendor."
5,Does the trick,"The cable I ordered came from Vortex, was only a couple of days slower to arrive than a product ordered from Amazon Prime, and completed the task for which it was needed (transfer all of the information on one MacBook hard drive to another MacBook via ""Migration Assistant""). I have no idea why a previous reviewer refers to the cable as ""dangerous garbage."" The cable I received seems resilient and durable despite being a few bucks less than cables qualifying for Prime. I found I had numerous cables with a fire wire connector on one end but not on the other. Moreover, cables with replicated male firewire connectors appear to be in short supply, so count yourself fortunate to come across this one. For the time being, I'm a happy camper. Should my computer start smoking, or smelling like a rotten Apple (no doubt because of some terrorist code implanted in the cable), you'll be the first to know."
3,"Good, but not the same as the picture","I received the cable in no time at all, far sooner than the estimated delivery. Perhaps if clearav would have spent more time with my order they would have sent me the right cable. I received a 1394 6-pin 6' cable and it works well, but it's black and looks nothing like the translucent cable I wanted; however, it was one of the better prices for this type of cable. I guess you pay for what you get."
1,product description and some reviews are misleading,"I bought it to transfer data from one macbook to another. Unfortunately, It doesn't work with Macbooks at all. Some reviews are misleading..."
5,heavy duty,This cable is great! My old one looks so inferior to this new one and came in great time .This is a great store!!
1,Almost amusing,"The game starts off in a very promising humorous vein; we play a fat hairy redneck trailer-park low-life who speaks like Elvis. Great; and some of the jokes actually work. and shooting it out at the trailer park is kinda amusing at first.But as soon as you get the truck on the road, forget it - for one thing, the maps supplied in the game are useless - green blobs for land, blue squiggles for waterways - and that's it, not even an on-map pointer to give us the simplest clue as to where we are.Did they just get bored with the game and give up?Feels like they rushed to get this on the market; they just wasted their time, and mine."
2,Typical Comic Book Come-On Cover,"As you would expect, I was hoping not, the cover is not what you get inside. Yes, it's an inexpensive shoot 'em up but it still leaves a whole lot to be desired. The controls are really mushy and the character (you) gets hung up quite a bit. There are some locations where you can stand and shoot like a carnival gallery and there are some unusually potent weapons for the ""back woods"". But my preference would be to see the female cousin having some fun right from the start, in fairly good resolution (not this game)...as it was after playing for at least 3.5 hours I still hadn't seen her...maybe she was just a ""cover girl"" in the worst sense of the word. Anyway if you're not real picky about your games and like to drink (moonshine) alot... this is your game."
2,country justice pc game,"Simply put this game is just plain ""STUPID"". Basic graphics and repeditive genre make this game mildly amusing at best. cheap game yes. get what you paid for yes. up to you on if its worth the time."
4,Rare and Well Done by Al Kooper,"This is 2 cd,s and gives a good history of Al Kooper.The book with it is very informative. Good cd,good value for the money,thanks."
4,Koop on Koopin' on,"Al Kooper tends to hand/clap himself. He makes sure you know he was young, talented, lucky, wrote pop songs HITS ""This Diamond Ring"" etc, cured laid down the organ urge to Bob Dylan's ""Like a Rolling Stone"".He wants you to know he set up so-called ""Super-Group"" w/ Steven Stills and Paul Butterfield. The first rock jam, ""Super Session"", a big seller, and the percusor to individual musicians figuring out how to let fame get the same LP sales..i.e Blind Faith etc..Al Kooper started a big band horn hearted soul-fulled yelp in 1968, ""Blood Sweat and Tears"", with an FM hit ""I Can't Quit Her"" and was either tossed out because of it or quit because the band became bigger than the father. It should be noted that Al Kooper assisted the band ""Chicago"" into its amalgamate of horns guitars soul vocals and bucks.This 2 CD set is history ""Rare and Well Done"" but mostly medium rareand needs side dishes for a fine meal."
3,"touching ,sentimental film dealing with friendship.","An aging ex rodeo star takes in a young soft spoken native kid who wants to be in the world of professinal bullriding. As the two men win contests all over they end up fighting because Red, (WIDMARK) Wants to win at any cost. A great coming of age story and yet it shows that bullriding isn't glamours it is really a way of life for some people. Another excellent performance from Richard Widmark. The film is certainly an unsung classic dealing with the strain of the ordinary life between a man and a boy."
3,Pretty good,"Most of the recipes seemed to work, except the lemon tart, which would not set ! (X 2!). The best (so far) have been the tortillas. Well laid out and beautifully photographed. This is my girlfriend's opinion. Any ideas on the lemon tart?"
3,Still hot.,Im a huge fan of the Living Legends crew and an even bigger fan of Grouch. This albums production is worth the purchase alone but I will admit this disc had a few low points [and I mainly point them at Luckyiam PSC]. Album is STILL worth a buy if you are a LL fan but more of a used buy if you are new to the Living Legends.
2,Yea...,"Well this cd kind of sucks considdering its by mys journ/Liv Leg. The only good track and its off the hook is track 11. U Might Knock This (Really) if the rest of this cd was as up beat as that track id love it! but its not sooo, its not really worth it unless you want 1 really good track and some slow borring tracks.."
3,Not very informative,"I'm a bit of a basketball junkie and was looking forward to reading this for a few months now. I read it in about 4 days and I'm not sure I learned anything. While some salary numbers and a few other secondary stories were interesting, there are no real revelations in this book and the editing leaves a lot to be desired, as there are numerous spelling errors and downright brain farts. At one point, as the story is talking about the Virginia Cavaliers, the author then calls them Cleveland, who are also known as the Cavaliers.The book is basically player profiles on about six guys as they make their way through college and into the NBA, and then a little further into the future. Just about all of it can be found on Wikipedia. If you are a casual fan that is interested in modern NBA history then I'd turn to Wikipedia first. If you're still yearning for more, maybe try this out."
2,Misleading title,"I was disappointed by this book. Despite its title, very little of it is devoted to the topic of HOW this draft allegedly changed basketball forever. The only part that really does so is the Epilogue (which, by definition, is only supposed to add ancillary information), and even then most of the ""evidence"" backing up the author's claim are a few statistics on how the NBA made more money in 2006 than 1984.The book essentially consists of biographical sketches of six 1984 NBA Draft prospects: Olajuwon, Bowie, Jordan, Barkley, Perkins and Stockton. Seasoned fans will already be familiar with most of what the author presents on these players. There is some interesting information regarding the specific maneuvering that allowed the teams to draft in the order that they did, but that is about it. On the whole, this is a book largely for those unfamiliar with the NBA and/or the six players mentioned. Basketball junkies will feel unsatisfied."
4,NICE!,"Like the other reviewer wrote, ""plain and simple this album is dope"". Features Sadat-X, De La Soul, Everlast, B-Real, Camp Lo, Dilated People, Phil Da Agony and a few more come together to make a real HIP-HOP compilation only for the true underground headz. My favorite joint on the CD is ""I Luv It!"" featuring Young Zee & Rah Digga. Cop this CD quick!"
5,The Best,Fabulous! Inspiring! Incredible portraits. Excellent introduction to the artist among his other styles.Don't miss out on it! Another must for the artist's studio. cathleen/modesto
3,Enjoy! but....,"This is good quality work, I heard of this book through NYLON magazine and I'd seen the film Great Expectations too. There are a few pages of work from the film, mainly of Gwyneth Paltrow. There are watercolours and oil on wood (which have really bold colours and the paper which this is printed on is good represents that. The only thing that really does (and it does!) detract from this talented artist is the fact that the watercolour section has the spine of the book going right through the centre of some pictures. Don't let that put you off too much though, I still enjoy it!"
1,The book contains too many errors,"The book is good in the sense of the simplicity with which the author tries to explain and introduce the concepts. However, it is full of errors: I could not find one example without errors. Specially in Chapter 4, which introduces SQL, there are too many errors. That is unforgivable!! I think the author of this book did not even check what he was writing. I do not recommend this book to anyone until a serious revision of all the examples is perfomed!"
5,Thank You,this book was exactly what I was looking for. I was married to a Czech lady so was missing that food.Thank You
3,"Good, with qualifications","As a Czech I can say that this book is good, if somewhat misleading. There are a great many recipes in the book that most Czechs have probably never heard of, and if they have, have never themselves had. As with people in most of the countries in Europe, Czechs have their tried and true favorites which they cook, by American standards, very frequently. If one only knew as a non-Czech what these best hits were they would not be dissatisfied with this book. However there is much room to go astray. Nevertheless I find some of the recipes in this book to be very good and have had the occasion to cook them for other czechs who enthusiastically agreed with me. The Time-Life book that covers the cooking of Austria, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia is an excellent book with fewer disappointments for the non-native person. But, if you like to experiment, you will eventually stumble upon some very good recipes with this book as well."
4,"Many good, traditional recipes","I've owned this book for years and use it frequently. As a Czech, I find it quite authentic. Many of the recipes come out just as I remember them from my childhood. The BUCHTY recipe is excellent, for example, as are many or the CUKROVI ones. I am surprised by the reviewer who says some of the dishes aren't authentic, because I've always had the impression that this book was a translation of a Czech cookbook. I agree with those reviewers who say that some of the dishes are unpractical or unpalatable in the American context. But such is the nature of Czech food! I like the fact that the names of the dishes are given in Czech and in English. My one problem with the book is the poorly organized index. Otherwise, DOBROU CHUT!"
2,"If you have ""Roots, Shoots, Buckets and Boots"" don't bother","Sharon Lovejoy's ""Roots, Shoots, Buckets and Boots"" has the a lot of the ideas that are in ""Sunflower Houses"". It's almost as if she wrote ""Sunflower Houses"" first, thought of better ways to illustrate and do the gardening plans, and then wrote ""Roots, Shoots..."" (I didn't check the publishing dates - so maybe this is true?)I bought both of these books through Amazon, and got ""Roots..."" first. It's a better book, with amazing illustrations. I thought ""Sunflower Houses"" would be just as good but when it came I was disappointed. It is really a repeat of much of the same stuff with less illustrations, and actually a lot less ideas. Illustrations are still really nice, and if you don't have the other book, you will like this one.(...)"
5,"A superb, detailed exploration of the Titanic tragedy","Through extensive research, some based on official inquiries into the tragedy and some from secondary sources, Daniel Allen Butler has assembled an outstanding story of the events that led to the ship's sinking, the actions of many passengers and crew and the aftermath. At once horrifying and compelling, this book does more than any other source I've seen to bring the details of the tragedy to life."
5,"Excellent retelling, kept me up all night!","I loved this book! It gave good solid facts written how history should be written. I could see the disgusted face of the quartermaster and captain as they fired off their last rocket, could see Phillips and Bride in the wireless room, could see the women crying for their husbands.As someone who still believes in ""Women and Children First"" and has held on to many of the values in this book, although not the class rigidity, the way he honored the sacrifices of many and the best- and the worst- of people that night is what made this book a great read for me.I find the Titanic disaster so interesting because it did not show the best and the worst of the era, but the best and worst of mankind. A sense of duty, protecting the weaker, giving your life for others- those are not traits limited to any era or class anymore then inertia ( for example seen by both some of the third class passengers and the Chief Officer), tastelessness or cowardice are."
1,Poorly written Titanic book,"Being very blunt, I can say with all honestly that Mr. Butler copied A Night to Remember almost word for word. He also never corrected any of Lord's mistakes. I think this is plagarism at it's worst"
5,READ THIS BOOK,"Even if you have read all the other ""Titanic"" books out there, you must read this one. Well researched and excellently told the author makes Titanic live again. Thru the personalities of the officers and crew to the many passengers of all classes this book reveals more than any other about the fateful 10 second encounter with an iceberg. I am recommending it to everyone!"
1,Nothing new,I found that this book did nothing but retell the same information as the host of other Titanic books before it. The amount of blatant errors is another let down. I'm quite surprised it has gotten such rave reviews. END
1,"Is this research, or a review article of other books?","This guys owes quite a bit to A Night To Remember, reading both books side by side. No original research, certainly not ""30 years"" worth, and to judge by the number of errors he has managed to transfer from other books to his, he didn't do much fact checking on his own. He seems to have just skimmed what was out there, and did an overview. Too bad for him that computer software that can pick up this sort of ""authorship"" has come on line.I've also looked over his venom-filled reviews of other books that I have to think he regards as competitors. He accuses other of profiting off of the disaster, but he pops this book out to coincide with the movie, and puts out another (shortly) to coincide with the 100th anniversary? Must be hard to speak out of both sides of one's mouth so loudly.Stick with spinning tall tales to elderly passengers on cruise ships, Dan."
1,A TITANIC FAILURE,"THE AUTHOR CLAIMS TO HAVE RESEARCHED THE TITANIC FOR THIRTY YEARS. WELL, THIRTY YEARS OF MISTAKES WENT INTO THIS BOOK. ALL THE CROSS CHECKING ERRORS AND HISTORICAL MISTAKES FIND THEIR WAY INTO THIS BOOK. HE SEEMS TO HAVE COPIED A NIGHT TO REMEMBER WORD FOR WORD IN SOME SECTIONS. I UNDERSTAND HE IS WRITING A BOOK ON THE LUSITANIA. THAT WILL BE TWO SHIPS HE HAS SUNK."
5,Comment by Walter Lord,"After reviewing Daniel Allen Butler's ""Unsinkable"" Walter Lord's critique was simple: ""It is a masterful treatment of the Titanic disaster, with a new look at the role played by the mystery ship, Californian."""
3,Decent Retelling,"""Unsinkable"" (The Full Story of the RMS Titanic) by David Allen Butler is enjoyable enough, particularly for those who have never read any other accounts. There are much worse versions out there (Pellegrino) but, unfortunately for this volume, there are much better. Walter Lord's two books set the standard and Wynn Craig Wade nicely follows it. There will be nothing new in this volume, other than the author's political conservatism seeping into the account. Much like the recent spate of books concerning the disaster at the Antartic with the expedition of Robert F. Scott, this book tries to preserve the image of the heroic British empire and see these man-made failures as triumphs of the character of the upper class British (and by inference, American) male. The beating of this particular drum can get a little repetitious. The Titanic, though, is always a fascinating and tragic story and the author keeps the narrative moving along nicely."
1,Piece of CRAP!,"Skip this book. It's a piece of crap! This guy has no clue and stole practically everything from""A Nght To Remember""! Pompous ass!"
4,Graphic SF Reader,"Mark has grown up, and with the assistance of a tough-minded reporter who changes his mind on what his duty is, has discovered what has been done to him, and what the military's real agenda is.He tells them to piss off, or else, and sets out to determine how he should live his life. To complicate matters, other more than human people are appearing, one of his former keeper's own creating.This is still very well done, it is a pity they have taken it from the Max line to dumb it down and make it more kid friendly."
4,You otter know otters!,"In this short booklet, one will get to know all the who's who and what's where of the otter tribes of Mossflower country! The beautiful poster that accompanies the booklet has full-color illustrations of all the most important otters in the Redwall saga. Inside the booklet, short histories of the otter VIPs, along with explainations of what a ""holt"" is, and why ""hullabaloos"" are so important to the otters, will make you an otter expert!Oh, and the recipe for ""shrimp and hootroot"" soup is well worth the price!!"

4,Too Much Metal!,"I just bought this today, and I don't think you've been told what it is. It's 2 cd's, the first is 20 tracks from bands we all know and love, like Shadows Fall, The Haunted, Diecast, God Forbid, Borknagar, ect. The second is the real kicker, though. It's an mp3 cd. 164 tracks. Again, all bands we know. It loses a half star for being like 12 hours long, and a half star because the mp3's are at different bitrates. (Only as low as 128, so all decent.) If you like metal, this is a must have."
5,Very well done!!!,If you are a Walter Payton fan. This purchase is a no brainer. Very well put together. I enjoy watching over and over.
4,Coffee Table Item,The best biography/overview of Payton so far. A lot of personal stuff and insight worth having for the DVD alone.
2,DVD defective,Mainly bought the book for the included DVD which is a compilation of Payton's highlights from high school through his NFL career. Very disappointed that the DVD is defective.
5,Should be a collector's item,The price is such a great deal. It even comes with a DVD. My son loved it as a gift. After reading it will look good on the bookshelf or coffee table.
5,Best CD you will ever own in your lifetime,"With a unique blend of ear piercing screamo and the ultimate melodic hardcore, Glassjaw's sophmore release is everything you ever wanted. Daryl Palumbo belts out vicious screams with a follow up of totally in-key melodic vocals that no one in the genre of hardcore could ever duplicate. I have seen this band 7 times, and every performance is carried out with much grace andstyle, putting every ounce of energy and their passion for music they have into each heart wrenching song. a must have"
5,This Kicks The Tail,this is the greatest album i have heard from new yorkers in a long time. i am happy to know that these guys for real. take a listen to this album and you will never feel the same about hardcore music ever again.
1,glassjaw doesn't want you to buy this,glassjaw had a big fight with roadrunnerthey dont get a cent from sales of this albumthey dont appreciate it was remixedtacked on with songs they dont approve ofpirate the old cd and listen to thatdont support roadrunnersupport glassjaw
1,hoh!,this is another teenage metal band! i hate the lyrics! please listen to great bands like led zeppelin and slayer! they are great! also van halen is good! the riffs are terrible! the vocals are too!
1,Nothing new here,"I dont know what the fuss about this band is about. I personally dont think that they are that good. This album gets old fast and some of these songs on here like ""Ry Ry's Song"" is just plain annoying. Why is it that you people are making such a big deal about this guy's singing? He's not breaking any new ground other than just flat out ripping off Chino Moreno from the Deftones. Just take ""7 Words"" from 'Adrenaline' and ""Chi"" from KoRn's 'Life Is Peachy' and you got this guy's singing style down. He must have just listened to a lot of KoRn and Deftones as a whiny little teenager. Wha wha wah.. life sucks.. I hate you.. I want to hurt you.. blah blah blah.. heard it all before. Dont waste your time with this crying little emo kid junk. This album is a waste of space. Try some real heavy and emotive music like Alice In Chains or even Tool."
2,"These guys have potential! add new singer, then well talk!","Albums like this really piss me off!! Its a classic case too! Glassjaw has some real potential! they have an awsome guitarist/bassist and drummer, but I can't listen to this band, because the vocals are DREADFUL!!!! The singer sounds like his voice is still breaking!! The lyrics aren't great, but I don't hate them. I just think these guy would be much better if they weren't trying to be The Deftones! There IS hope for glassjaw and bands like them!"
2,Cord art hard,"2 1/2Contrived mix of overly angular guitar assaults, emo-influenced choruses, and schizophrenic vocals isn't much besides short-lived blazes of artcore."
2,"Great stuff, until the singing starts","This album would be great, really great, right up there with Tool's Aenima (the best album of all time, by the way), if not for Daryl Polumbo's horrible vocals. Listen, I'm sorry if the guy's got a debilitating stomache disease, I really am, but that's no excuse for not being able to sing. Many bands today seem to think that by screaming bloody murder and then injecting clean, melodic choruses, you get a good song. This only works if you have a good voice (like the awesome Corey Taylor of Slipknot). Not to mention the fact that Polumbo has no concept of melody or lyrical structure. You don't have to follow rules in music, but you should at least respect them. Polumbo's haphazard, sporattic screaming and less-then-melodic clean voice just bring this album down. And that's too bad, because the musicianship is just awesome. When Polumbo learns how to sing, then these guys will get five stars. Until then, no."
1,an honest review,"all i can say about this band is one word...overrated. I had high expectations for GJ after reading all these positive reviews and i really wanted to like them after hearing them, but i can't fool myself. i honestly feel like throwing up as i play this cd through. I'm by no means into pop music, but the way these songs jump around so much sounds like garbage, not to mention this singer doesn't carry melodies near as good as all these people claim. He reminds me of chino moreno of the deftones when he's using his semi-whisper voice, except i can at least tolerate chino, unlike this guy. check it out and see for yourself if you feel the need, but i'm definitely disappointed in this album."
5,GJ,"I read some of the bad reviews on here and I can't, by any means, say that you are wrong. However, if you want to argue your case and influence the reader, I would stop comparing them to other bands. ""YEAH LED ZEP, SLAYER, TOOL, DEFTONES...THOSE ARE WAY BETTER, GLASSJAW IS A RIP.""Instead of posting incoherent, ignorant comments that do nothing but tell the reader what kind of music YOU personally enjoy, you could simply state that the music wasn't for you and that you don't suggest it.Anyway...I suggest Glassjaw to anyone. Their songs are catchy, but don't necessarily have a mainstream sound to them. Song structure is great and the songs just, well, make a lot of sense to me both sound-wise and lyrical-wise. I just love this band. The first time I heard them, I was hooked. I highly recommend this album and the rest of their releases. Talented people making great music...you can't go wrong."
4,Beauty in the shape of a bullet,"The first couple times I listened to the CD I hated it, but for some reason I kept listening to it and in a few weeks I realized that this CD is awesome. This music is naked and honest, these guys dont hold back, especially the singer who feels no shame in going into a fit of screaming. Plenty of good songs and the secret song is a perfect ending to the album. Good work."
5,Distance,"This album is the most amazing thing I've heard. Every song on it is overwhelmingly beautiful. I've never heard a band thathas such raw emotion as Glassjaw. As said in a lot of the other reviews, this album is definitlely not for everyone. It has the tendency to depress you. In order to get the full effect, you have to listen carefully to the whole album, though. It's beautiful. It's the only album that has actually amazed me, made me cry, overwhelm me with beauty, and made me scared. Enjoy this album if you buy it. I know I did."
5,one of the best albums i own,"I love this album to death. when i first heard glassjaw i didn't like his voice...but like a lot of great stuff...it kinda grew on me. this album is packed w/ raw emotion, and is not to mention awesome musically. there was one point where i'd listen to this album on a loop and nothing else, and i'm still not tired of it. its awesome how when darren sings you can tell he totally means what hes saying. lots of the stuff on here is really heavy, but some songs like her middle name was boom are purely melodic..well except the last part. this is one of those albums that just gets better everytime you hear it. i dont consider myself a listener to any particular kind of music, but this is definitely good stuff."
5,This cd is not RAP METAL,"Being a straight edge kid, I still get interested when I hear about former ""youth crew"" members (in this case, former Side By Side/Project X/Judge/Youth Of Today/Shelter etc drummer Sammy Siegler) doing new bands. When I heard that this new band, called Glassjaw, were going to be signed to Roadrunner and produced by Limp Korn Slipknot etc producer Ross Robinson I was a little apprehensive, since I absolutely loathe the stuff he has worked on in the past. But once I heard descriptions of Glassjaws sound as chaotic post/hardcore/emo I had to give it a listen. I picked up the cd and it was stuck in my player for days. Then I put it away for months and kind of forgot about it until recently...and now I can't stop listening to it yet again. Don't listen to what anyone will tell you, this band is not rap metal, or Deftones (...) ....it's straight up emotional post hardcore emo rock. hehehe. Simple as that.Greg xxx"
5,Best debut of the year,"I got this cd on the day of it's release and I have listened to it almost non-stop since then, and I still can't think of how to put their sound into words. The vocalist is unbelievable, already one of my favorites, and the rest of the band prefectly combines powerful hardcore with melodic chords and cool guitar sound effects. The best definition I can give is that it takes the sound of the Deftones to a completely new level, but that still doesn't come close because they don't sound like the Deftones. Anyone who might be put off because they think that the fact that Ross Robinson produced it will have a Korn-like sound will be totally wrong. The sound quality is totally different from any of the other bands Ross Robinson has done, it has excellent clarity and it isnt murky or unclear. If you buy one cd this year, make it this one, you wont regret it."
5,perfect tool for removing old tiles,"i used this tool to remove old tiles from the bathroom and the kitchen. it worked very well. i didn't even break a sweat. Wear your protective gears such as ear muff, and eye protection goggle. This is a great tool for removing tiles. Solid built."
5,Simply perfect,"Better value than the other blue hammer. Easy change SDS plus bits. Comes with grease and two chisels. Perfect for tile, brick and stonework removal. Not too heavy or powerful to be used for long periods or do excessive damage.Made in Germany."
4,Christmas album,I'd heard some of the songs on pandora so decided to purchase it. Overall good CD just be aware leans more towards the religious side.
1,Little Girl Lost,"As someone whose copies of ""Llegar a ti"" and ""Mi corazón"" get regular workouts, I was very disappointed with this holiday offering from Jaci.The overall tone of the album is very little girl, whispy voice, bland arrangement, and lacking in personality -- not the Jaci of her latest album! In fact, this sounds like the work of an unsure 14-year-old; I wondered if the tracks had been laid down several years ago before she found her voice.Sigh... I was hoping for a lot more."
2,This is pretty bad stuff,"Okay, so the Jaci Velazquez worshipers out there will want to kill me for this, but I don't think I've ever heard such an awful Christmas CD as this one. I bought it as a gift for my wife, who adores Jaci, and my wife wanted to throw it away after listening to it. This album goes to prove that just because someone has a good voice and strong talent, that person can't necessarily sing effectively in other styles, such as jazz, crooning, etc. There are a few gems here (hence the second star) such as tracks 1, 2, and 11, and tracks 3, 4, and 5 are decent, but there are also some awful songs. Her version of ""Let It Snow. . ."" is truly painful to listen to, and the remake of ""The Chipmunk Song"" is pathetic at best. I love Jaci's contemporary stuff, but she's out of her element here, trying to pull off what Amy Grant did with her second Christmas album, and it simply doesn't work."
4,A Soul Touching Read,"The stories in this book can bring tears to your eyes, a smile to your lips, and also allow you time for introspection and the ability to walk down your own ""memory lane"". Ms. Banks spins a delightful series of memories and tales, and the book is a wonderful gift to share with friends and family members."
3,disappointing at best...,"I wasn't expecting the sun, moon, and stars for $20, but I *was* expecting a quality at least on par with the little sewing kits one can find for five dollars in a grocery store.The box is beautiful, and will be handy for storage. The tools that come with the box, however, are all but worthless. I don't think I've ever had a needle bend in my grasp from just a few minutes of sewing two layers of cotton fabric before. Nor have I ever had one dull within five minutes of use -- I was sewing a pressing cushion twelve inches long by six inches wide on either end, and had to change needles after completing only one end and about three inches of one side in simple backstitch.The pinchushion, of course, has not an ounce of emery in it, which is not entirely unexpected, but to add insult to injury, when I switched needles, the threader broke, on only its second use. The only redeeming item in this kit, then, is quite likely the box itself."
5,very cute,was a christmas present and has everything you need to sew and more. it's also very cute and organizable. thanks and seller is very recommended!!!
1,Disappointed You,"I returned this product looking at the picture , I perceive this to be a much larger Sewing box . It is actually very small and flimsy , the Spools of thread Are misleading they are actually very small in size . I would not recommend this Product"
1,I'm very upset.,I'm very upset with this product. I bought it as a gift and it came in and I opened it immediately to decorate and wrap it for a very close friend. I opened the beat up box to find the chest in pieces! It's doable but definitely not what I paid for. The pieces aren't even whole. One corner is obviously broken off and even if I fix it there will be a noticeable crack. I don't know if I'll be using Amazon again....
3,"Nice comeback, JT","This album was the follow to Flag, in my opinion easily the worst of Taylor's distinguished career. ""Dad Loves His Work"" demonstrated that he was still capable of delivering the goods, and for that reason alone this is a very important record. It's not as strong overall as his succeeding albums -- ""That's Why I'm Here,"" ""Never Die Young,"" ""New Moon Shine"" -- but there are some real gems here. ""I Will Follow"" and ""That Lonesome Road"" are stunningly beautiful and Taylor's voice is hauntingly understated on both. ""Hard Times,"" ""Her Town Too,"" and ""Believe It Or Not"" are winners. ""Summer's Here"" is good fun. ""Stand And Fight,"" ""Sugar Trade"" and ""London Town"" don't measure up to those standards, however. Three stars may not seem enough to some JT lovers, but I'm measuring this against his other work. He produced several albums that were superior to this, but ""Dad Loves His Work"" really defined a new and positive career path for Taylor in the early 1980's."
4,Great service...great book,I've been on the hunt for these books for years and now I almost have the complete set. The book is in great condition and the service was prompt. :)
4,Toured and played in Greece but recorded later.,"Dizzy Gillespie and his band toured Greece in1956. At the time there were student rock throwing riots. Dizzy played on. However, this record was not made in Greece. The performances and arrangements are excellent. 'Yesterdays','Tin Tin Deo','Groovin' For Nat','Annie's Dance' were recorded with the same personnel that toured Greece, but in May 1956. The band swing beautifully at times with sax players Phil Woods, Jimmy Powell, Billy Mitchell, not forgetting Dizzy. The other tracks also are covered in a 2CD release 'Birk's Works' with a different musical line up but still slamming the eardrums. Inspirational. Full of solos. Dizzy ,Benny Golson (tenor), Melba Liston (trombone) make it happen. Again great arrangements. Can't fail."
1,Not the right length,"Real quick and simple. I like Magnaflow cats, and have always used their direct fits in my other cars. For some reason though this one is only 15 1/4"" when the OEM in my car is 17"". It's way too short. Amazon and Mangnaflow both say it fits, but I was the one under the car, it doesn't fit... Also, Amazon's specs say it's 17"" but Magnaflow says on their website it's 15 1/4"". I wish I had looked that up before this ordering fiasco. 1 star is for misleading description, I'm sure if you can get it to fit it's a nice product."
1,Wrong description,"Same problem as previous poster. It was supposedly 17.75 in. in length, which is what I required, but when I got the part, it was only 15.25 in. in length. A whole 2.5 in. less than what it stated and what I needed. Whoever is putting up the specifications should actually look at the part before they type in random numbers. The part may have been fine, but it does one no good if it doesn't fit as it is described."
2,Great while it lasted,"I bought this mixer in Feb. 2007 because of all of the good reviews at Consumer Search. It worked very well until June 2008, when the power button died. I do not use the mixer heavily at all, maybe once or twice a month. Given the price, I thought it would last much longer. It lasted just long enough not to be under warranty any longer. I am very disappointed, and I certainly won't spend another $70 for this mixer."
2,Bought September 2006; Died June 2009,"I liked this mixer, and like a previous reviewer already stated, it was great while it lasted. Alas, it only lasted for 2 years and 9 months. I suspect the problem was the electronic controls, rather than the motor itself. If Kitchenaid made another hand mixer with non-electronic controls, I would have bought it as a replacement. Instead, I went with the Cuisinart 5-speed hand mixer, which has manual speed controls."
2,Good while it lasts,I received this mixer for Christmas 2007. I do not do a lot of baking so it was hardly used. I went to use it the other day and it would not turn on. I have never had a mixer this bad. It also does not have the speed that my old hand mixer did. I wish I had not given my old one away. I will not replace this one with another KitchenAid.
1,Nearly Worthless,"I'm online right now to purchase a new hand mixer to replace this piece of junk. We've suffered through using it for a few years and cannot stand to use it one more time.The motor is weak. The beaters are poorly designed and do not mix ingredients as well as other mixers I've had in the past (that I wish I had kept instead of supposedly ""upgrading""). The last straw is that now the beaters don't stay clicked into the unit and have fallen out a few times while in use! ~~ a major safety issue.If all you want to mix is a few eggs, this mixer will be fine, but then you'd be better off and a penny wiser to simply use a whisk. If you plan on using it for anything aside from liquids, look elsewhere. Vastly overpriced for its mediocre, and now dangerous, performance. This isn't the first horrible KitchenAid appliance we've had the misfortune of having, but it is definitely the last."
2,i listened to the clips and etc.....,and this cat sounds like e-40 i was highly disgusted and i serioulsy couldnt listen to this whole damn thing....i was shocked it....made me....*iz tramuatized* >=```(
4,one of the most influencial hip hop albums to date!,"I really liked this album, cause of all the creativity involved, and if anyone happens to read this review, i COMMAND YOU TO BUY THIS ALBUM!"
5,Fabuloous Shave Gel,My husband found this Shave Gel while on vacation in the UK several years ago. He feels it is the best on the market and uses it exclusively.
3,Good product.,"I've tried this version and the ""regular"" version of this product. Honestly, I like the ""regular"" version better."
2,Has this guy actually hiked these routes???,"Take this book with a grain of salt. I used it last October to plan a climb of Whitney via the Meysan Lake route and found the route descriptions to be woefully inadequate in conveying the difficulty of the terrain and route. I learned later that others have had the same problem with this book. We completed our hike, but are veteran backcountry travellers in good physical condition. And even we were seriously taxed by this ""moderate"" route. Later we saw some on-line correspondence which indicated we weren't the first ones to be suckered in by this particular route description in this particular book. Some other guide books I've since checked out describe this author's ""moderate"" route as ""gruelling."" Those writers must have actually hiked the Meysan Lake route - I suspect this author has not."
2,Whitney Guide,Was a bit disappointed...information (such as bear and water purification info) were not up to date. Otherwise OK.
4,It's iight,"Yo, after I listened to this album I was seriously impressed by the new sound freestyle music was taking. ""Forever"" really brought that out. It's new yet it has a classic touch. If your thinking of buying this song, I clearly think it's a definite grab for your collection."
1,Outdated,This work is extremely outdated and presents an old view of mystery religions as simply an early version of Christianity. Anyone interested in the mystery cults is best advised to avoid this work.
2,dissatisfied,"You get what you pay for. This ststement is tried and true. I bought a cell phone for three dollads, that will not hold a charge. Now I must buy another battery. And pay shipping charges again.If the product had been satafactory then I would have saved a chunk of money. What can I say,you win some and you lose some."
5,A moving meditation on social lament,"This book is much more than a cultural studies consideration of the Los Angeles Uprisings/Riots of 1992, but really a deeper reflection on contemporary US society and culture of which 1992 was the rawest example. Not only wide-ranging in the material that Song engages but also deeply informed by literary criticism and social theory, it is not an overestimation to say that this book is a mark of Song's erudition. And perhaps most importantly, this is one of the most lucid pieces of critical prose that I've read in a long time."
3,A good though forgettable concert,"As soon as it came out I bought it and I felt a bit disappointed. Even though the singers are quite good, each and every one of them sing just one aria and in many cases you are expecting to listen to another one sung by the same artist. But that does not happen, they just sing and vanish and there is no singing all together in the end. Actually the conductor and his orchestra finish the concert with three instrumental pieces at the end. It lacks strength as a whole but there are certain magical moments such as a bass singing the first aria (Pape) or the ever shining star Netrebko. If you are into opera do not expect too much and it may fulfill your expectations."
1,The price you pay is only One Season of Damages not both season 1 & 2,"I don't like the way the saler put Season 1-2 is trying to confuse the buyer. Actually The price you pay is only One Season Danages, not both of season 1 & 2. Be careful !"
5,What a great show,I recently just started watching Damages so I wanted to be able to catch up from the begining. I couldn't find the dvd's in the stores anywhere. Needless to say I was very happy when I saw Damages on Amazon.Thank you.
2,"Damages: Seasons 1, 2 & 3","I was very disappointed to discover, after I received the 3 sets of ""Damages"" DVDs...that there were ONLY Spanish subtitles!I need to have English subtitles.Do you have any suggestion?Can I mail back all 3 sets of ""Damages"" DVDs...and could you provide me with the same sets of DVDs BUT with English subtitles?RegardsFrederic Chapus"
4,Actually very interesting textbook,I wasn't sure what to expect from this class/textbook but I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed reading most of the stories and essays.
4,A fun toy,Tito santa is a great wrestler.The scan is very realistic the face looks like how he did before.I reccomand this to everybody.
1,They sent me a wrong item not the one I really ordered as seen in the picture! For me it was deceiving!,"BUT I don't have that time to return and refund I just assembles the item but It IS NOT THE ONE ON THE PICTURE!!!! It was still a white iron metal bistro set but a different kind., it looked less detailed and less intricate with design unlike this one.AMAZON should have notified me exactly prior to delivering or at least change the picture if this one is out of stock already! Am disappointed and very surprised!"
2,Here We Go Again.........,"Oh-oh..... Yet another blatant attempt to seduce us with artifice over substance. This Angelina Jolie look-alike is the industry's next ""jazz singer/diva/sex symbol. (Think Diana Krall). She meticulously and obsessively oversings; never mining the meaning of the words, but rather stringing together every possible combination of notes relating to the chord changes. An earlier customer review praised her for singing all those ""# 11's:"" That's exactly what's wrong with her approach. Technique and academic knowledge are a poor substitute for warmth and intimacy. All in all , she leaves me cold. And as for the ""hired gun"" rhythm section: old-school jazz musicians are often the last people to connect emotionally with the melody and words. But we, the listeners, want that connection, not just another pretty face."
2,"An adaquite singer, but nothing new or spectacular...","Try Anita O'Day, Sarah Vaughan, June Christy, and Ella Fitzgerald, then you'll realize how much Monheit lacks, she's pretty and has a nice voice, but not unique..."
1,i went to school with this girl,"i went to school with this girl, and although she has a great voice, she is unbelivebly conceited. i just hope some others with her talent can make it, who deserve it."
4,chicago is wrong,"rriordan (from chicago, June, 18, 2001) needs to lighten up. Monheit has a great gift. She can really sing well - people should buy this album, and not ""wait 20 years"". rriordan sounds like one of those academics who overanalyze things that are simply meant to be enjoyed for what they are. Lighten up, Riordan."
5,No comparisons necessary !,"The greatest compliment I can pay Ms. Monheit is that she doesn't have to be compared to anyone else. She stands on her own. I am amazed at the maturity of this very young woman. Her musicianship is impeccable and she demonstrates great respect for a lyric. Some singers make the lyric accomodate the melody. She doesn't do that. She apparently reads the lyric first, which is what all good singers do. Her combination musicianship, artistry, and a fine instrument at such a young age make for an intersting musical future for Ms. Monheit and devotees of fine singing."
5,Ask Those Who Know,"Ms.Monheit is recorded with world class musicians. I have seen her perform at The Village Vanguard, The Blue Note. Lincoln Center, as well as other venues. The musicians that have accompanied her are Kenny Barron, Bruce Barth, Bill May, Ron Carter, Jay Leonhart, Christian McBride,Bucky Pizzarrelli, Hank Crawford, David""Fathead"" Newman, Joel Frahm, Lewis Nash, Grady Tate, Bobby Huchinson, Tom Harrell, Harvie Schwartz,Tommy Flanagan among others. This is high enough recommendation to her cd, ""Never Neverland"". She displays sincerity, and warm feeling in the tunes recorded. The young lady is surely a comer."
5,Great Potential,"Previous reviews all have some truth. Monheit is remarkably accomplished, and sings right now better than most vocalists. She's got flawless pitch, good phrasing, and a very pretty voice with a wide range. She's five stars now. It's true she hasn't got that magic of a great jazz singer. But she's only 22. Carmen had a pretty voice at 22. She became great when her voice took on a harsh edge and her phrasing became percussive. Sarah was not the great Sassy at age 22. Even Ella was too girlish and pretty. The scat and great rhythmic stuff came later. Monheit is enormously talented. She may go toward pop, where she could be a great hit. Let's hope she chooses jazz. She's started on this CD with some of the best jazz people around."
5,Absolutely Breathtaking!!!!!!!,I found this CD by accident and it hasn't left my CD player since! Ms. Monheit has an extraordinary voice!!! I am looking forward to more releases by this artist!
3,A Good First Effort,"This CD is an exceptional effort for someone as young as Ms. Monheit emerging in a music genre as unlikely as jazz. Her vocal ability is quite impressive, but it's almost as if this CD was intended to ""show off"" her voice. A lot of typical jazz vocal acrobatics and the songs are the usual crop of jazz standards. I can forgive that being it is her first time out and some of the best jazz musicians were rounded up to back her. The lack of originality is why I can't give it more stars. I hope now that she's got a following, her record company will give her creative room to wander off the beaten path and truly come into her own style. Maybe even perform some original material. She's got a lot of room and time to grow. I look forward to what she does next."
4,A great CD,"Jane Monheit's debut album is a great buy. The music on this CD is excellent. To me, it has as 1940's or 50's quality to it that I find extremely appealing. If all her albums to come are this good, she can look forward to one great Jazz career!"
2,A snooze,"There is nothing really wrong with this singer. Actually, technically she is quite proficient. But I look for music that makes me feel something deep emotionally and to me this is bland pap--lifestyle ""jazz"" for that Starbucks set. Don't make the mistake of assuming that having Ron Carter, Lewis Nash, and Kenny Barron as a backing band is a vote of confidence in the singer. Although they are great musicians, in this case these guys are hired guns-- nothing more and nothing less, and that is the way they are playing behind her. I wouldn't bother writing anything at all about Jane if it weren't for the amount of hype she has gotten that actually made me expect to hear something valuable. This CD is flavor free."
5,Full of Surprises,"If you look at the contents on this album, there is nothing really special here. It's a collection of standards which have been recorded many times. However, the beautiful, statuesque Miss Monheit breathes new life into these old chesnuts. A schooled musician out of the Manhattan School of Music, Miss Monheit takes harmonic and rhythmic chances everywhere and they all pay off. Her ending on the ninth in ""No Detour Ahead"" is truly inspired. She adds #11s all over the place. And this is her first album! From a meeting with her, I could tell that she loves and understands the music and she is one cool person. I hope she crosses over into mainstream acceptance."
5,Polished and confident,"I was first introduced to this album last Christmas, and my mouth dropped. What a voice. Ms Monheit sings with superb confidence. My personal favorite from this album is ""My Foolish Heart"". This is the way it was meant to be sung."
1,Yawn. Blah. Gimme a break.,"She's easy on the eyes, even easy on the ears, but she's nothing special. Over-managed and over-marketed. They've done a good job of trying to lend her some credibility, but I agree wholeheartedly that she's up there with Britney Spears and other teeny boppers. Just a different repetoire. She obviously doesn't know what she's singing about, just parroting the vocal styles of greater artists. I'm downright offended by the ""Ella reborn"" comments, as any jazz lover would be if you compare the two. I'll be shocked if this girl ever releases anything original or groundbreaking. After reading the New York Times profile, I fear for the future of jazz. An artist of her slender talents does not deserve such accolades."
1,Seriously lacking...,"Jane Monheit might possibly the most over-hyped jazz artist of all time. While her singing is technically good, she lacks any feeling for the music. Maybe her age has something to do with it, but look at Norah Jones - same age, but (IMO) with so much soul and feeling. Hopefully Jane can get things sorted out and get on the right track."
1,not so Hot...Krall has nothing to worry about,Jane needs a lot of seasoning to be considered in the same league as Diana Krall or Natalie Cole and others.... wish I liked this disc but its frankly....boring
5,SWONDERFUL,Ms.Jane M. has got that voice that wants you to listen to her music over and over again. What a wonderful talent she is. I sure will buy more of her music. She can set any mood with her style. This lady has a great gift to share with us music people. I can't say enough about her. I guess by now you know I have become one of her many fans. Keep the good work up Jane.
2,second riordan's rview,"It is way too early to compare her to jazz legends. Her voice is beautiful, but she doesn't live and breath jazz . She sounds too perfect and trained and typical of the latest jazz vocals to emerge. If you want to hear someone who can really sing jazz , might I suggest Emilie Bishop , undiscovered by the mainstream ,but definitely worth the search. good luck Jane, you sound nice, but you are no Sarah Vaughan, not yet."
1,well....umm...sounds like she's fakin it,hate to write a bad review about anyone...I'm sure she means well and is a nice person......she just doesn't convince me at all that she understands the lyrics that she sings........ some people are never able to do that....quite likely growing up a bit will help... I couldn't reccomend this to a friend....try Diana Krall instead
2,Britney Spears of Jazz,"Yes, a fabulous instrument (voice). Pretty package. Completely marketable. Indicative of the ""pop""-ing of Jazz (will probably get nominated for and win a Grammy, but why? Cause she sold alot of units. How about Nancy King? oops, not marketable). Could I listen to the whole thing straight through? No. Far too syrupy, lacking depth and maturity. Saw her live, and it was all about being bequilling and sexual (thought she was singing Cole Porter's ""Love For Sale"" every song but with different lyrics and melodies). Over-sings the endings of every tune. Why some singers/producers won't believe that we can recognize talent without vocal gymnastics is a mystery. Maybe I'll see her again in 10 years and be blown away. However, right now, it's all marketing and hoopla. Die hard jazz fans will not appreciate this C.D. and if you want a worthwhile pop/jazz C.D., purchase Joni Mitchells ""Both Sides Now""."
3,"Music to your ears, but not your soul","Jane does have a melodious voice and its music that you would really enjoy while having dinner, dancing to, or when you are doing your own little thing. But if you are like me who sometimes just wants to listen to music and do nothing else, you may be a little dissapointed, as it does not stir your soul. Her voice lacks the passion and emotion, things many of us look for.In conclusion, its not a CD that is a 'must have' , but a good add on to your collection if you receive it as a gift."
3,Don't let the title misguide you,"It would have been more appropriate if Mr Kagan would have called his book ""A collection of reflections"". If you expect a meaningfull contribution to the ""Theory of Mind"" you will probably be disappointed."
4,"Unusually competent ""look at me"" compilation","Rachel Barton is the real deal in the world of classical violin. That keeps this CD from being merely the usual ego statement. Her brilliance, clarity, and terrifying intelligence give this collection depth and make it worth many listenings."
4,Budget amps that rock!!!!!,I bought two of these amps to replace the factory amps on two Dayton SUB 120 home theater subs. The factory amps were rated at 150 watts @ 8 ohms with a 12db/octave xover. the Dayton SA240 amps are were rated at 240 watts @ 4ohms with a 24 db/octave xovers. Now the newly revamped subs rock my block! According to my neighbors.
2,You REALLY have to want it!,"I am a huge fan of '50's and 60's music, so this collection is aimed for folks like me. Unfortunately, there is too much here that is rather obscure, and much other which is locatable elsewhere (they do call this ""Hard to Find"", after all).If, like me you want a copy of Cosby's spoof ""Little Old Man"", you will buy this, cause it cannot be found elsewhere. I guess the marketers put a few songs like that on each disc of this collection, and hope we'll buy a bunch of discs for one or two songs. You can fill in the name of any one of about a third of the songs on this disc and come up with the same result.Sometimes they are right. But there is way too much filler here. I call myself a fan of the genre, but only heard of 60% of the songs or artists. Not the kind of value any but the most fanatical of us want."
4,Searching for good music,I know this is to review your music and I think it's excellent. but I'm looking for music that I can buy by song. I have most of the songs in your CD's. Can you help me find the songs that I'm missing??ThanksRoger
4,mix-up,"In your index of tunes to listen to, if you try to hear #2you actually get #6; you want deep purple you get bill cosby.Just thought you'd like to know.Long Live Rock&Roll,et al."
5,This is the 60's.,"If you grew up in the 60's you will love this album, er CD. It has the songs you used to listen to driving to school everyday.If you are much younger but like 60's music this will also entertain you. Many unexpected artists perform on this Cd."
4,Wifey,The splatter screen overall is performing well. It doesn't quite fit my skillet so some splatter escapes. I love that the handle folds for easy storage.
4,It is what it is,This is a heavy duty splatter screen ... it's better than the usual window-screen type splatter screens because it's easier to clean and the handle folds away. It probably does a little better job of actually keeping the oil off the cook top but nothing's going to eliminate splatter completely.
5,Does what it's supposed to,The best complement for a gadget is that it does what it's supposed to. the folding handle helps with storage.
4,"Protects Clean Surfaces, Exposed Skin","This screen works great to keep oil from spitting all over the stove top and your arms. It fits comfortably on top of all my pots and pans. Also, it's dishwasher safe and the handle folds for storage, so that's good too."
2,Not so good,"This screen is a good idea. The concept is good. But the handle weighs it down on one side. Then the lid doesn't fit well on the skillet or pan. And since the handle isn't flat or shaped to fit around a skillet handle, it doesn't rest well at all on the skillet. Basically this thing slips and turns and goes all over the doggone stove. Enough said."
3,Doesn't stop grease splatter too well!,"I bought this because it was sturdier that the other mesh screen splatter guards, which it is. However, when frying something, the holes in the screen are a bit too large and let a lot of the grease out onto the stove top. I've had much better success with the mesh screens for stopping the grease, but they don't last as long because they aren't as sturdy."
4,bigger than expected like the folding handle,"Finally, have meant to get one of these for years. Now I can pan fry bacon w/o having to scrub off the whole stove, back splash etc. Kinda big to store but covers all our pans. The folding handle helps w storage."
5,Great Quality,"For a kitchen gadget that you normally categorize as a ""can do without"" item, I have found this a very useful kitchen tool. I had used the mesh type before and found they didn't last and were a pain to clean. This is a quality item. It is easy to clean and does it's job very well."
5,Best of it's kind I've seen,"I've seen cheaper versions at Target and honestly, I haven't tried them, but this one is SO nice and SO sturdy that I trust it completely. It cleans easy and I can already tell will last a long time."
2,Doesn't contain grease well enough,"I've bought dozens of Oxo Good Grips products before and this splatter screen is the only one that has disappointed me. It's constructed very well and has a solid feel (except for the handle which could use a better locking mechanism).The problem with this product is the splatter screen itself. Instead of being a fine mesh formed by wires like other screens, this screen is essentially a piece of perforated sheet metal. This means the holes are considerably larger than a mesh-style screen, which unfortunately results in a lot more grease getting through it unabated. Now I don't expect any splatter shield to catch 100% of grease, but after witnessing the amount of grease flying out the top of this after searing a piece of chicken, this screen's performance is simply unacceptable.Looks like I'll be finding a more traditional, mesh-style splatter screen to avoid greasy stoves and floors."
2,Overkill.,"I wanted a splatter screen without a handle sticking out the side so I could store it in a convenient place. I looked and I could only find this one and a tefal type. I purchased this one and the main thing I noticed is this thing is big and bulky overkill design I guess their designers don't know of the KISS design method (Keep it Simple Stupid). Another bad thing is that it is made with perferated metal instead of a screen which makes it impossible to see your food which one's with stainless steel screens you can see what's going on. I went to IKEA after I used this and found one that is what I was looking for in the first place. One with a stainless steel mesh, can fit any size pan and a small lift up handle in the middle of the splatter screen and it was only $3. Compared to the IKEA splatter screen the OXO looks clumsy, over designed, heavy, overpriced and pointless."
4,Best so far!,"This is about the third type of splatter screen that I have used and this one is about the best so far. I bought mine with a discount coupon so the price was about five bucks cheaper than Amazon. It is very heavy duty and I like that the handle folds, making it convenient to put in the dish washer and to store. I love the flavors of fried foods but HATE the greasy mess that it can create! That said, I also use one of those folding things that stand up around three sides of the pan while I fry with this on top the pan. I do put a sheet of damp paper towel put only on the portion of the screen which is on the outside not protected by the stand up screen. This prevents most of the little bits of grease from flying onto the floor, but still allows the steam out of the rear portion.Overall, I really like this splatter screen. Its also easy to hand wash and you don't have to worry about the screen warping like those cheaper brands."
4,More useful than I thought,"I don't splurge much and had a hard time justifying this purchase... but it was the right price to combine with some other items I bought with the ""buy 4, get 1 free deal"". As it turns out, I use it all the time. No more oil splattered all over the kitchen! Plus, it's so easy to toss in the dishwasher for clean-up. A great buy!"
2,OXO splatter screen a peice of crap,"I got this OXO splatter screen today and was very disapointed it is very flimsey made, the holes are too large, you have too be very careful when you use this as the handle can flip back on you and the holes doesn't really stop much grease. The best splatter screen made is by Simple Cooking but you have too buy the whole package screen, glass lid, and skillet. all for $29.95. The only thing is they don't sell the splatter screen by itself. Anyway buyers beware the OXO splatter screen is apeice of crap and way over priced. Don Stearsman.P.S. Sams Club sells the Simple Cooking set."
3,Splatter screen not perfect,"I love the way the metal is molded to fit different pan sizes. The handle design that fits over the pots handle is wonderful. Keeps the lid in position. But, the size of the holes is large enough that I still get grease splattering on the stove's backsplash when frying and/or sauteing."
2,Awkward and Lumpy,Personally i am not a big fan of this product. I would not want to go any distance with this uncomfortable pack on...
1,Not in good shape at all.,"I received my pack in good time. Shipping was great. The pack itself is in pretty rough shape. There is a hole in the bottom of the pack and it is very very worn. I paid WAY too much for the shape that it's in! Not too happy, but I don't want to go to the trouble of returning it :/ I live in a very very rural area and it's a huge hassel to have to return items!"
5,best military pack,"I cant imagine camping without my old one, now i have two of the greatest military packs u can get...a must have"
3,Smells like vomit...,"The backpack is great. More than expected... BUT, it smells like hell. I dont't know if it's some kind of glue or something, but it smells like vomit. I can't even keep it inside my house."
5,best back pack,just got my alice pack in the mail today looks just like the picture couldnt be any happyer with what i got mine also came with the straps too i give it five stars for its good condition and the fast shiping .
4,Small Alice Review,"I thought the pack was made from a polymer based material, but it is made of cotton. That said, I just used it on a 3-day hunting trip in west Texas and it worked fine. Good stitching and soft. This is a good weekend pack of any use. I also think this is a good pack for scouts. I will use it for short trips and camp-outs. Too smal for long term. A good value."
5,"Great pack, but the straps...","The ALICE Pack is as described. Looks almost new, made of durable nylon, everything is intact. It has a bit of a funky smell, but otherwise it's great. The straps, as it says on the invoice that came with the pack, are commercially made, and it's kind of hard attaching them securely. Overall great buy, and for the price the straps that were included are good.Edit: To get rid of the smell, I soaked it overnight in a water/baking soda solution. Dried out in the sun for a day or two, and then rinsed with water."
5,great pack!,"These are great packs! They are durable and they make make a great beginners pack for hikers or a bob that wont break the bank! My only downside is that my bag smells a little bad like most surplus stuff, but some frebreeze seem to have fixed that."
3,Hardly Balanced,"Count the number of times Dawkins et al are quoted, mentioned, or have misunderstandings about their ideas extensively ""clarified"" by the author.Then count the number of times Gould et al are quoted, etc.I haven't done it, but I will bet $5 that the ratio is at least 10 to 1 in favour of the Dawkinsians. Got to page 150 of 200 or so pages and really started to wonder, ""Okay, when does the presentation and defense of Gould's ideas start?"".As a member of the ""general public"", apparently the target audience for this book, I learned very little about Gould, other than personal details and repetition of dreadful insults."
4,Terrific Tribute,"Wonderful music and concert. My favourite was Dave Matthews rendition of The Needle and the Damage Done. Not an easy note to sing and Dave did it amazingly. Elton John, Leon Russell and Sheryl Crowe did a great rendition of Helpless. Was a little disappointed in Jackson Browne and I'm not a big Josh Groban fan. Apart from that, it was a sterling effort. Would definitely recommend this to any Crosby Stiils Nash and Young fans. It was also great to see Stephen Stills, David Crosby and Graham Nash on the show."
4,Pretty good with a couple dissapointments.,This DVD is generally good with a few of the artist's falling short of the mark on their renditions of Neil's great songs. There are many great versions as well...I am glad I bought this DVD.
2,Mediocre Performances,I just finished watching this on Palladia and was very disappointed. I love Neil's music and anticipated a great show. Instead you find yourself wanting to hear Neil sing these again as these cover artists are BLAH to say the least. I'm glad I didn't spend the money to own this. I was glad to see that he was honered.
2,Great video & sound. Phoned-in performances except WILCO.,"Sorry to say that most of the prior reviews are spot-on. This will appeal to so many people with good music taste that clearly deserve something better for their money, even if it is a fundraiser. This is such an uninspired show. You'd think from the lineup (and the man being honored) that Wilco wouldn't have been the only ones to put some thought and practice into their tribute. Broken Arrow is a three-run homer. The rest are strike-outs and weak grounders. Most are borderline boring. Sorry, but Neil Young deserves a better tribute and you deserve more for your $20..."
2,Don't bother; Neil has his music covered.,"No one sings Neil Young like Neil Young and this tribute concert proves it. The only credible performances were John Fogerty singing ""Rockin' In The Free World"" and are you ready Josh Groban doing ""Harvest Moon"".The rest were pretty amateur especially in front of Neil and his friends. He deserved the honor, not the music."
1,They Sure Don't Care About Making A Decent Show,"It was clear to me after the first song I was watching the work of an incompetent director or maybe no director at all. Some performances are great, Wilco rises to a difficult challenge on ""Broken Arrow"", and others seem to be doing their best with mixed results, but the production is stripped of any sense of the event. I suppose this was constructed as a product to sell to TV and the thinking was, ""We've got big big names, let's cut and paste one of each without even bothering to mention the lesser known support players and see who will take the bait. It's a shame. I'm sure there was a lot of worthwhile performances left out for the sake of convenience. Disappointing is putting it mildly.ps Watching virtuoso guitarist Dave Mathews feign compassion on ""The Needle And The Damage Done"" was a comical high point."
1,Dull and boring,"Not much to say... watched it on Palladium.... had trouble staying awake. Boring and dull covers. Cant say anything about the blu-ray quality since I watched it on tv. Im a big fan of concert dvd's, but wont waste money on a disc that I hope to never have to see again."
1,GOOD PRESENTATION /BAD PERFORMANCE,"I usually just rate audio/video quality on concert discs, but these performances require a special comment. The audio presentation is above average with a broad soundstage, plenty of ""air"" between the instruments and solid well recorded bass. There is palpable three dimensional body to the DTS 5.1 sound track. Video is average for a live show. Most of the performances are jam session or open mic at the bowling alley quality. Some of these artists should hang it up or show up for rehersal. The exceptions are WILCO doing an excellent note for note version of Buffalo Springfields ""Broken Arrow"" and CSN on ""Human Highway."" I'm getting rid of this sucker immediately."
5,It makes me cold just thinking about it...,"This was my first book by this author and I will now look for more. While all of the Inuit language had me looking for the glossary a few times it kept me up at night to finish it. I liked how the author ties the old ways of the Inuits, racism and survival into one tale. With the vivid description I found myself shivering even while sitting next to a wood stove with the description of the howling winds. Kept me guessing until the last chapter."
4,"A haunting, claustraphobic mystery with a touch of mysticism","If you like authors Sue Henry and Dana Stabenow, here is a great new find in the Alaskan mystery genre!! Read it in the summer. Reading it on a cold, dark winters night might be a little too real to handle. I highly recommend this book."
4,So far so good!,I have only had this for a few weeks but it seems to work well. I had 2 apc backups that went down after a couple of months. A work associate has had the Belkin for a year with no problems. Good value.
2,Gives no warning when it is no longer protecting,"I purchased the unit in Feb 2008. Was able to experience a couple power outages while on the computer on the same night just after 3 year warranty (May 2011). There was no protection, no warning. The computer quit instantly along with the UPS (no beeping - dead). When power came back on, there was a green light on the UPS showing no fault. Power went out again, the computer had no backup power and quit instantly along with the UPS."
1,Do Not Buy This - No Replacement Batteries are Available,"If you want to throw your money away, buy this UPS. If you want to have a UPS that will last, buy another one that has replacement batteries available. Moreover, my battery did not last 3 years, as claimed. I had a recent blackout in which the battery died within 2 minutes. Previously, I had enough time to shut down my computer. This time, I didn't.I've very galled that Belkin has the nerve to continue to sell this unsupported product."
3,Technician's Review,"An ornament for your belt buckle, not actually meant to be used. Such a shame, it's a great idea. If you're buying it for looks, go ahead, but for usage - refrain. As seen from the image, it has small sharp grooves to keep fingers from entering inside the holes, and if they do fit - it would hurt the user. Overall, an average product for Hot Topic kiddos, not for actual users."
5,S...S.......STUPID INVADERS!,"Stupid invaders is the coo...lest game in the world!Firstly,it is fun ,challenging & zany!It can be a bit hard though as it is very confusing!The clues given are not enough!You need brains 4 this game!Sometimes,it can get boring while in other times it is go...od!If you think youhave had enough of boring old games then this creative marvel is 4 u!Go ahead,& get it pal.............!"
5,Best dreamcast game ive ever played!,"Whaaaaa...you dont own stupid invaders....BUY IT RIGHT NOW ......IT! THIS IS THE BEST GAME KNOWN TO MAN. THERES HILARIOUSE CUT SCENES AND PLAYING IT IS AWOSOME. ALL LEVELS ARE FUN AND FUNNY. SO IF YOU DONT OWN THIS GAME, YOU HAVE TO BUY IT...NOOOOOOWWWWW!"
2,Too hard. Just for experts,"What do you know about DEA? Are you an expert in Operational Research, Linear Programming, Algebra and Statistics and interested in DEA's mathematics? Or are you just willing to learn enough to apply DEA model in a simple and interesting case you found? Well, I'm an industrial engineering student without much time to get deep in DEA studies. Although I have some knowledge in statistics and OR, I just wanted to apply DEA model in a fast food chain. In this case, I do not recommend this book. I quit reading it as it was hard to understand and full of non-sense equations. On the other hand, it might be useful if you are doing a deep research about DEA, its theory etc."
1,Don't Bother with this one!,"Like all of you who read this review,you're Everest junkies who probably won't even get near this mountain, but are hooked on all books about it.High; Stories of survival from Everest and K2 is NOT what you're looking for. This book is nothing but one-chapter excerpts from other books. It's like walking into a movie half way through: You have no idea what's going on. Also, there are no maps of either Everest or K2, so if writers of these chapters (and some of them are BORING writers!) describe trouble on Everest's north col or K2's Abruzzi ridge, we can't picture these places in our minds.This book (unlike all the other Everest books I bought and immediately read) has been sitting on my bedstand for months. I only read it when I wake up at 3AM and can't go back to sleep. Just reading from this book puts me back to sleep reeeeeal fast!Don't bother with this one. The Everest season is happening right now. Maybe more books will come from this year's hikers."
1,Unbelievably monotonous,"I ready Jon Krakauer's ""Into Thin Air"" before this book. I was mezmorised and enthralled by that book. Based on my experience with that book, I thought this book would be cool. It wasn't. I found out that if you've read one book about this topic, you've read them all. Every story in this book was just like the one before it. I stopped 85 pages short of finishing this book (I HATE not finishing a book but I just couldn't stand it anymore). I threw the book in the recycle bin. What a complete waste of money. If you've never read a book like this, read ""Into Thin Air"" and stop there."
5,Free at Last!,"My husband is disabled and I've only gone back to work after a long absence from the working world. When we've been sick we've simply had to do without because there was no money for a doctor. Now at last, I can grow some of the things I need to keep us healthy. No recommended I know, but the doctor's antibiotics don't always work and are too expensive to buy and not work."
3,good information,Some good information about how antibiotics work as well as the various classes of antibiotics. Also recommends good alternatives to them and when you should use herbal alternatives vs when you should use antibiotics.
3,"Somewhat helpful, but out of date","I used this guide to get ready for the 0041 section of the Praxis II. It was helpful because it showed me how the questions were written and how many of each subject I could expect. I believe that two questions in this guide were actually on the test I took! Some of the portions (like the art/literature section) are fun to answer, but they are no longer on the test. It is a helpful guide overall, but I suggest trying to buy it used."
5,Immensely easy to use and more effective than a mechanical juicer.,"This is a must have kitchen tool. What a joy to use.It can extract the juice to the point where what is left inside therind is virtually dry to the touch. Cleanup? All I have to do is rinse itunder some running water and ""lightly"" go over it with a brush, it doesn't requiresoapy water and why would I risk drying out such fine wood with a soapy soak - a quickrinse and be done with it. Nothing could be easier.Here's a tip. I work the reamer over a cup or glass filled with water.After you have extracted out the juice notice all that small amount of nice semi-dry pulp thatremained clinging to the reamer ribs? Don't waste that, simply dip the reamer intothat cup/glass of water and the pulp floats off easily into the juice contained water.Wonderful product, outdoes any mechanical juicer for efficiency and cleanup takes mere seconds.Enjoy"
1,Watch For Blue Stuff,"Nice little tool. Helps me to get about 40-50% more of the pulp out of lemons after I squeeze them.....that was why I wanted it.UPDATE 06/11/11: I washed this item with soap and water after ever use, especially since it is wooden. I used it only for extracting lemon juice 'n pulp pretty much every day. Well, I didn't use it for about 3-4 days and when I did take it from the drawer there was blue stuff all over the ridges. It wiped off easy so I am assuming it was some sorta mold.It may be fine to use on some foods, but for acid fruits like lemons, it is not good and also scary."
4,very good and inexpensive,I was looking for a reamer since I put so much lemon juice in my water . I purchased this reamer because of the brand name and the price. I followed one recommendation from a review about coating it with mineral oil before my first use (to prevent drying out and cracking) - and so far it is working! I have had it for at least a month.
5,Simplicity Wins Again,This reamer looks like something my grandmother would have had in her drawer. It's simple and it WORKS. Nothing fancy - easy to use - easy to clean up. A GREAT Reamer. I absolutely love mine and use it all the time.
5,Love this,"I have several reamers, but for the price, you can't beat a plain wooden one. I started out with this model, and after using it several times a week, decided to purchase a nice metal one. I prefer my metal reamer, but this is really a great, inexpensive one too. Every kitchen should definitely have one!"
5,Three Years Later...Still Love it.,"Great tool. Use it, rinse it, put it back in the drawer. Excellent Condition still. Mine has a prime spot in a favorite drawer. I always smile to myself when I see it, because I just love using it and it is very pretty too.I use it more frequently than my electronic citrus juicer. I first bought it for a master cleanse and regular cooking. I sneak citrus into our dinners because of the high vitamin c content. This is the perfect tool. If you can only have one, this is it. Got mine at Ross.Perfectly ""sharp"" edges and point for juicing, I would trust a responsible 7 year old with it and probably not freak if he lent it to a 4 year old momentary... just an fyi, in case you are looking for kid friendly kitchen gadgets :)"
5,Oxo Good Grips Wooden Reamer,"I have wanted one of these since seeing one on a TV cooking show. It works great, is simple to use, easy to clean. Item was as advertised and was shipped promptly."
3,Why the Iraquis hate us.,"Since I have never been to Iraq, I would not know if Iraqis hate us or not. I suspect they hate our occupation of the country-whether they are Shiite or Sunni. I know the Kurds love us, but that is beyond the pale of this book. Shiites think we are being too lenient on the Sunnis. Sunnis think we have turned over the reigns of power to the Shiites. Fighting between both distorts chances of peace.This was written at the height of the civil conflict. War was waging between the sects. Now however, there is some political horse trading and coalition building, so Iraq may yet open up as some sort of liberalized Middle Eastern state.This is an OK book about the civil conflict in Iraq from 2003-2007. Things have changed and gotten somewhat better. However, this opens up the difficult period following Saddam's overthrow."
2,At least it mentions the Anfal Campaign,"This was the dreaded extermination against the Iraqi Kurds Saddam undertook which brutally resulted in the murder of way over 90,000 Iraqi Kurds and 4,000 Iraqi villages. No one can walk away from this book reading that and think Saddam was a good guy in anyway when he was leader of Iraq."
5,Tidy Turtle Bib,This is the best bib on the market. It keeps your childs outfits dry and mostly free of food. Of course food does drop on their pants or on the floor. This is made of the best material I have seen and works like a champ. My daughter actually enjoys wearing it.
3,"Nice bib, but child doesn't want to wear it","2 year old doesn't like to put this on with the sleeves and all, and hasn't for a while. It's a good idea, and I like the material, but he just isn't interested in wearing it."
4,This is the place to get the ORIGINAL VERSIONS of all her country era hits. Most other collections contain re-recordings,"This is a nice overview of the LS and United Artists/Liberty era Cristy Lane recordings, and it contains most of the hits from those eras, and all of the bigger hits.More significantly, these are the ORIGINAL VERSIONS, properly licensed. Most of the other Cristy Lane collections out there have re-recordings of songs from this era--usually not properly noted as such.If you like her country material, this is the collection to get.Pretty unattractive cover art, though..."
4,Work as they should,"This brand was specified by my physiotherapist who actually directed me via the Amazon link to purchase them. They work as designed, are a high quality orthotic, and they were economical."
2,Seal with wine bottles is quite loose,"I have several of the old style OXO wine stoppers which are all rubber. Not real pretty, but the old stoppers work great so I decided to get a few more assuming these new stoppers would work as well as the older style. I was wrong.We use the stoppers to put opened bottles of wine back in the wine fridge and the bottles are usually turned on their sides. No problem with the old style stoppers, but these new stoppers begin to leak wine immediately from standard size wine bottles. I guess these stoppers are made for a bottle that sits upright in your refrigerator, but wine coolers put the bottles on side."
3,An engrossing work of fiction,"Mr. Lee certainly writes an engrossing and fast-paced book. However, how much of it is true? The section that deals with the massacre at ESL is, unfortunately, a work of fiction. I was an employee at ESL at the time and for many years both before and after the Farley episode. I thought my memory might have been faulty, so I checked with other longtime ESL employees. None of them remember Mr. Lee. If that part of his book is not true, what other details are fiction also? That being said, the book is still a worthwhile read for entertainment."
3,Starts off great the quickly fizzels.,The begining and end of the book were good but the middle left alot to be desired. When I heard all the reviews about this book I thought it would be about the dark side of chinatown but he was really not involved in any of the drama of Chinatown. The book just seemed to lack something to me!
2,Touching At Times...,"...but in the end it didn't work for me. Probably, because the tone of the book was more drivel if anything else. Bill Lee, I'm afraid, isn't much of a writer. Some of the drama he experiences in his life feels like a soap opera. If you happened to enjoy THE JOY LUCK CLUB you might like this book, but, unfortunately, I didn't like either book."
5,Simply the best,"THis is quite simply the best book available on Australia's enigma....the Echidna. Peegy and Mike have collaborated brilliantly with mind boggling field work, awesome observation and stunning photographs all being brought together in a format which is immensely readable. Many books that try to fill this biology niche drone on endlessly with obscure data which simply turns readers off. Peggy and Mike are both brilliant communicators and have given us a book which brings the very best of research over endless years in the field .....and feed it to us in a wonderfully accessable way. It is a delight for the eye....for the mind and importantly for the heart....for it is in understanding creatures that we learn to cherish them. And after all this book at its heart is an elegant and beautiful plea for Echidnas and their place in our world."
4,"Well made, performs well","A well constructed UPS. Comes with cables for all connections. Performs well in keeping my home theater going for a few minutes in the event of power failure. Poor Macintosh support for computer connection, but built-tin Mac power management control can handle it."
3,Works great for awhile...,"I bought the Tripp Lite HT850UPS and after 25 months of use (one month out of warranty) it died. It did get me through a couple brown outs but it was dead. I called Tripp Lite and they were sad to tell me that my warranty had expired and now I have a very big and expensive paper weight. They offered to sell me a new one at a discount, about 10% off retail, I declined. After some brainstorming I opened the battery compartment to find the battery had been leaking. I cleaned it up, put a $15 12v rechargeable battery in it and now I'm back in business. Sad that Tripp Lite lost a customer for $15. I guess every company is just out for that mighty dollar, and not much more."
4,great example of hardcore,"i saw these guys about a month and a half ago open up for evergreen terrace and the calico system.... f*cking blew my mind away... i ended up buying the album a week later and it hasn't left my cd player.... josh james vocals are loud, obnoxious, and powerful.... the guitar work is fantastic.... the only thing about this album that i don't care for is the songwriting..... very unoriginal... but hey, not bad for a bunch of kids"
2,Actually That Bad,"Talk about a let down! This album was neither hot nor cold, so I spewed it out of my ipod. It was just so bland, the last album had seasoning, funny movie quotes (though that one track with the 30 second movie line was a little gratitous (smart man Mic)) but I just don't know. Really I can't say too much bad about this cause I just couldn't pay attention to it, it's really boring, there were two good songs (Coke-Bong whatever and the Ship to Port song) but the rest were so bland, so bland! I'd say listen to this first, if you like generic mosh core be my guest, if your the kind of kid who lacks a discerning ear then look this way, but I demand perfection! Damnit!"
5,Contains two wonderful love songs,"One of the best voices of the folk era singing lovely ballads, this album is beautiful. Forty five years after I first heard Glenn do ""Love's Been Good to Me"" and ""The Lovers"", I still want to play them again and again. Then I was looking forward to discovering love; now I look back on a rich life. Both songs are just right on. The rest of the album offers the joy of listening to Glenn's rich tenor telling simple tales. This album is fine to hear if you're alone but would be even better to share with someone who could appreciate it as much as you do."
1,Didn't work,"The electrical charger does not work. I bought two, and neither of them worked. The car charger seems to work. The case fits. But the main charger doesn't work, and that's the reason why I bought the sets (one for my sis, and one for me). I'd return it if it was worth it, but shipping cost more than the product."
1,Just Cause,I live in Australia and was sent the wrong version. My son cannot play the version of the game in Australia. Someone should have noticed this before despatching the wrong version to Australia.
2,"""Just Cause"" Review","Overall I give this game 2/5 based on my scale.-Graphics: O -This game looks like its a PSX game the way the graphics are.-Music: O -Only about 3 or so types of music, repeats about so many seconds.-Missions/Plot: * -Lots of missions and the plot is quite good.-Controls: O -Ground Vehicles are hard to control, Can't customize controller buttons other than ABCD defaults.-Areas: * -I like the huge areas to explore, lots of places, kinda look the same though..."
4,you will feel you are James Bond,The other reviews have pretty much said what I think of the game but I must add that with all the stunts and action you have to do in this game you will feel like the protagonist in a James Bond movie. The stunts are so exciting I even go back to some missions just to make them again!
3,"Deservedly obscure, perhaps...","The idea of a Medieval glimpse into the workings of New Rome proffers such a promise: don't get your hopes up. Liuprand was probably typical of his time, and his surprisingly opionated and barbed observations of people are timeless (they sound like a disgruntled person at any time), perhaps, yet give far less of a sense of the time and the place than I had hoped.We shall have to imagine the gilded cathedral walls, the winding pathways and the ponderous palaces in our imagination still: they're missing in this catty account. Liuprand may have been a good ambassador, but he was no Procopius nor Anna Comnena.I am sure this has historical significance, but without some more copious notes and references, it is not a text for most readers. I have read a shelf-full of Byzantine histories and accounts. Robert Graves Belisarius is a thousand times more evocative and seemingly real than this actual piece of history! Gives one pause...you can pass it up!"
1,Horrible book ! One of the most hardest to read books out there,This book has no flow. It expects you to know lots of its own new jargon making it extremely hard to read. Not recommended for a course in neurocomputing.Reading the chapers does not help you to solve the problems at the end of chapter. The problems are a chapter on their own.Stay away from this book !!!
3,"Good overview of history, chemistry, behavioral affects.","In searching for sources on inhalents for a research paper, this was the single best source I could find. Excellent history, discussion of chemistry and how solvents act in the body, medical complications, and behavioral affects. The book is weak in epidemeology, and does not address treatment at all. However, it is a good starting point from which to build your knowledge base. Easy to read."
5,an outstanding book,"This book tells the stories of seventeen of Rome's most redoubtable enemies. In engaging and informative prose, Philip Matyszak gives us a glimpse into the Mediterranean world from 264 BC to AD 476. But this is not a book of names and dates. It is the highly readable narrative of fascinating people and great civilizations. The text is supplemented by maps, translations from ancient historians such as Tacitus and Cassius Dio, representative line drawings, and photos. I read The Enemies of Rome with a sense of pleasure rather than a sense of obligation.I would have liked to see more material on Fritigern and the battle of Adrianople, which was mentioned only briefly in the chapter on Alaric the Visigoth. However, this is only a small lack in an otherwise outstanding book."
3,An ok book,"This book is somewhat entertaining, but some of the vignettes can get a little redundant and monotonous by the end of the book."
2,"Love the footage, but not the music!","The images in this video are terrific--exactly what cats (the ones who watch TV, anyway) like. I wish I'd known how much music there was, though, because my cat is just as stimulated by the accompanying sounds. In addition, it would have been really nice if they'd had the SOUNDS of the squirrels to go along with the video of them, instead of the same bird chirping. This one doesn't interest him nearly as much as ""While You Are Gone"" and if I'd known about the audio portion of it, I would have passed on it. My cat won't watch this video, but watched a PBS Nature program about crows for the full hour!"
4,cat video,"I had this on video and was happy to find it on DVD. The old video I had was a lot better, but, you will be surprised to see your cats reaction when the birds start tweeting. I have my DVD player hooked up to the stereo and turn the volume up when I have this on. The directions say to remove everything from the top of your tv and they are right. My younger cat jumped up on the tv and was batting at the birds from the top. My other cat kept trying to get behind the tv to catch the birds."
3,Some Parts More Interesting Than Others,"This DVD has some good parts, and some other parts that did not interest my cat. I like the fact that it plays on a continuous loop."
2,Kitten is not interested,"Kitten is not interested at all. We played the DVD couple of times and he barely ever looked at it.The item is overpriced, specially with $5.00+ for standard domestic shipping.Hope your cat likes it. Our cat couldn't care less."
5,It's great.,"This is a great video for cats. I got a different one awhile ago that was cheaper, but they weren't that into it (it had footage of hamsters, a fish tank, etc). They are enthralled by this one, however. This video is pretty much birds and squirrels, and I think that's really all you need. It starts off with some dorky music, but the dorky music stops after a few minutes and then it's just natural critter sounds. My kitties will just sit, enthralled, watching the action. Sometimes they will try to attack the TV (really). Highly recommended, especially if you have indoor-only cats who get bored."
2,Very disappointed,"I actually already own the Video Catnip video. One of my cats likes it, the other couldn't care less. Since my VCR is on its last leg, getting a DVD version seemed like a good idea, especially because the video is short and this promises extra footage. This is the worst production of a DVD ever. There are NO chapters or ways to skip ahead - you have to fast forward through just like a VHS tape. And the extra footage? The sound is so low that it's essentially useless. (The sound is what attracts the kitties.) So all in all - total ripoff. Poor quality DVD at grossly inflated prices."
5,Very surprised!,"My cat loves this DVD! She sits on my bed and watches it for hours! The beginning has some silly songs and she has no interest until the real bird sounds start, but from that point she is glued to my TV. She's older so she doesn't attack the screen, she just likes to watch it. It's pretty funny to witness since she's very active and needs a lot of play time. It's my quiet time to finally check my email without her trying to dance on my keyboard."
5,Perfect Halloween Costume,This was the perfect Halloween costume for my princess. It goes on easily and is lightweight so that the infant doesn't get too hot. We purchased a onesie for her to wear underneath for a chilly trick-or-treating.
3,Ummm a bit confusing and hard for non readers,"well, this game says it was created by teachers but I am not so sure. I'd say the number section is clearer and better in design/graphics, while the letters part is a bit confusing...even to an adult! I sat and watched and starred and starred and could not figure out exactly what you were supposed to jump to/on when it said to rhyme with a word that is spoken...there are a lot of words and it is just confusing. I hate games that are trying to teach a kid but really just frustrate them. My son just turned 6 and mabye that is the problem, but like I said it was confusing to me too in some parts.Kinda a bummer cause it might be boring for a kid who can already read and knows their numbers well, but too confusing for a kid who this game claims to be trying to teach. not the worst game I've seen but not as good as I'd hoped."
3,It's pretty good,"If only all educational titles looked this good! Brain Games is basically a stripped-down version of the original 2D Rayman, but with math (my worst subject in school) and word levels thrown in. My 5-yr-old brother had a real blast with the handful of practice levels-I couldn't tear him away from it! (Ya think he would get tired after 8 hrs of straight play)! But the actual""activity"" levels had too many simultaneous challenges-like finding the right word while jumping from a ledge and trying to avoid a baddie-that it was too much to handle. Still a worthy purchase."
1,Bad for what it is supposed to be used for.,"This is not a good game for the age group it is recommended for. If it was just an action game for like 10 year olds it would be fine, but the children that should be able to play the game usually can't. I am almost 13 and a very good gamer in types of games like this, but I couldn't even get past the second level of this thing. If you are at least 10 this may be a good game for you, but for small children, save those 10 bucks. I hope this is helpful enough to persuade you."
5,I was stunned to know he could read my mind.,"""Having read Sonny Gratzer's General Issue Blues, I was stunned to know he could read my mind. When I read Gratzer's words, I felt as if I had written them. I certainly thought them. I am not a writer. I am, however, a Combat Veteran of Viet Nam and I can feel what Gratzer has written about Viet Nam and he is on target. He should write more about his experiences because he strikes a chord. Fire for effect, Sonny!"""
5,A great book to make you reflect on love and war,Sonny surprised me. I knew he was a great talker. but his writting surpasses his speech.I now know why there is pain in his eyes. Not all of which is from the physical problems.I am very proud of you and your book.Vi
5,Exactly as advertised,I got exactly what I wanted. The box was identical to the original chain that came with my saw. Husqvarna 316 Electric.
5,Well worth the wait,"I must say that I am very pleased with the quality of the production, as well as the important facts, ideas, symbols and scriptural references presented in the video -- it was worth the wait. It was refreshing and unique to see everything put together in such a clear, concise and easy-to-understand format. I suppose the best part of all is that actual proof of this doctrine/science may be had by any couple who sucessfully practices the Path of the Perfect Matrimony."
2,A little interesting.,"This doesn't really convince.It has some provocative notions that seem to make sense,but there are too many claims and assertions with too flimsy evidence.The video said that Adam's Hebrew name totalled 144,000. I would like to know whether that is true, and how unlikely it is. Does it total other numbers? Do many names total 144,000, because of the nature of the Hebrew language?It seems there is as much disagreement among gnostics as among fundamentalist Christians. I could be wrong, I've looked more into the latter."
5,This will open your eyes....,This was a life changing film. This is one that can change your whole world. I will be watching it again because it spoke to my soul. Never before have I been so inspired to grow! Never have I wanted this bad; to leave my sad and suffering world behind...and come into the light.
5,Clean and Refreshing Insight into Real Tantra,"This production left nothing but positive impressions for me after watching. Potential viewers should not be turned away by the title, this DVD is completely clean and mature audiences will find no vulgar or crude material here. Open-minded individuals from all religious backgrounds will be inspired by the message and teachings of this film. Spirituality and sexuality are synthesized in White Tantra.On a side-note, your understanding of the Bible will really open up, particularly the story of Adam and Eve."
2,Misleading promotion on capability of Motown CD's,"I ordered the Motown Karoke CD's, which included 3 CD's with 40 songs. It cost 39.99 plus shipping and handling was additional. What I received, however was 1 Motown Chartbusters set, vols. 1-6. I was unable to use it with the new Karaoke machine, which I purchased for my family reunion. The ""G"" for graphics was no where to be found on the set I received. I was so disappointed about the Amazon misleading information, and most importantly, I had disapppointed my family.Disappointed and cautious about ordering anything else from Amazon.com"
4,"Good Format, Poor Quality","This video is great because of its DVD format, however the fact that it was obviously a transfer (and a poor one at that) from a VHS tape is glaringly appearent. The information however, and the visual aid it serves as is invaluable otherwise I would give it a terrible rating. I would recommend this to someone who is interested in the subject and is tired of just reading and is almost ready to get their hands dirty."
4,Murder in Ancient Egypt isn't easy to solve.,"The first in this series of novels has Lord Meren investigating a murder in the sacred Place of Anubis. For those unfamiliar with Egyptian religion, Anubis was the God of Embalming. Bodies were embalmed, a long and laborious process, before being entombed. Egyptians believed that without the proper spells, amulets, and procedures after death, a soul, or ka would not enter the afterlife.This being known, it is unthinkable that someone would kill in the Place of Anubis. This person must have been most desperate and bold in order to do so. Meren discovers there is no lack of suspects. The man was disliked by his collegues and his family alike. Suspects are going fast, however, two of them are murdered before the true nature of the crime is discovered. At the heart of these crimes is an unholy greed that could consume Meren and his son Kysen before they discover the truth."
4,Historical Mystery with A Wonderful Background,"What a wonderful vacation read. I've read and enjoyed historical mysteries, but the vast majority seem to be stuck in Middle Ages Europe. Although Christie had done an Egyptian mystery, it was written in the 40s. Now Ms Robinson comes along with a series set in the reign of young King Tut. Due to the upheavals caused by Pharoah Ankhnetan (spelling?) turning to a new religion, the court atmosphere is one of intrigue as the ancient priests re-assert their power. The 'detective' Lord Meren is a man who was tortured and forced to admit allegiance to the god Aton and now wears a brand with the sun god's symbol. Meren and his son are called in by the pharoah to solve a murder in the Place of Anubis, where the dead are sent for mummification. Robinson does an excellent job of conveying the atmosphere without slipping into anachronism. All in all, an excellent book for fans of the historical mystery looking to get out of the Middle Ages."
2,"Trite, trite, trite!","With all due respect to those who have reviewed this book favorably, I was greatly disappointed. The characters are flat and predictable, almost caracatures. How many times do hysterical woman have to throw around pottery? The plot is pretty good, but is also predictable--I figured out most of it half way through. The final scene was almost gratuitous as well as being poorly set up. Even historically it seems questionable--most sources I know would not place the famous letter to the Hittite king during Tutahnkaman's reign. The more logical place for this event is after Tutahnkaman's death when the now twice widowed queen would be faced with a marriage to non-royalty (presumably Ay or Horemheb)."
2,Great Story Bad Ending,"The story was very good with a lot of details. I enjoyed the first three quarters of the book but was very disappointed at the ending. Without giving anything away, the ending was concluded in about ten pages. I personally don't like that. I like when there is a big finale and you are unsure of what is going to happen. This was far from my expectations. It is very disappointing to read a good plot and then lose interest at the end. I felt that his book lacked any imagination at the end."
2,Good Plot Bad Ending,The story was very good and keep you guessing to the very end. The only problem that I had with the ending was that it was completed in about ten pages. There was no intrigue and in my opinion no setup or big finale. She just ended it in about ten pages. I was waitnig for a great conclusion and was very let down.
4,This is just what I was looking for,This book is just what I was looking for. I have been searching for book dealing with life in ancient Egypt (even if it is ficticious) for some time now. This book and hopefully the series has completed my search.
2,Murder in the place of Anubis,"Ms. Robinson does recreate the life and times of ancient Egypt quite well.While I found the book interesting, I feel that it is historically inaccurate. Ms. Robinson seems to follow the 12-year co-regency theory of Cyril Aldred too much.Examples:1) She makes Akhenaten a villian and dictator when he was not. This opinion is based on the books that I've read.2) By all the evidence I've read on Amarna, there was most probably only a 2-year co-regency between Amenhotep III and Akhenaten.3) Tutankamen was Akhenaten's son, not his brother; Tut's mother was probably a lesser wife or a harem woman.Interpretation of the personalities of the main people at Amarna is difficult as the evidence is often too fragmentary. It requires reading many books and articles over a number of years to get some idea of these persons."
4,Essential reading for buyers of custom software,"This book prepares buyers of custom software for the pitfalls inherent in developing a system. It explains why there must be give and take between buyer and developer, and why ""tough"" contracts offer little protection. I suspect this will come as news to many first-time buyers."
4,An Odd Title for Odd Music,"This album has nothing to do with Bela Lugosi. It is a fine collection of Romanian folk music, which relies heavily on fiddle, pipes, and squeezebox to create songs that are melancholy when not downright depressing. Song titles such as ""Sorrow, sorrow, I am Sorrowful,"" ""Lament of Szek,"" and ""Slow lad's Dance"" all betray the deep hopelessness of a long-oppressed land. Even the happiest-sounding song, ""I am a flax flower,"" trades humanity for a simnple life of bliss. This album doesn't need a black cape or the hellish power of the living dead to seduce you - its honesty is all it needs."
2,It didn't at all satisfy the hopes I put into it,If you have played the first one and you hope to get the same out of this one ... dream on. Because of the on-line capabilty they had to change the handling. Which pardon my French: ... now! It is nowhere close to the great handling in the first game and the championship is only an option if you play it online. All in all I'm very dissapointed with it. Unless you are a hardcore on-line player and can't live without the net capability I would not recommend the game for you!
3,"fun game, but why no offline multiplayer?!",Sometimes I just want to play offline against my kid but I can't do it with this game - can only play multiplayer online. Otherwise a fun game...
3,Chain Saw dropped off truck,Product is just what I needed after the saw blade was bent - part was delivered quickly and installed the next day.
5,"Poulan pro 20"" chainsaw blade","This is an OEM item and is the cheapest on the web. If you must have the plastic item holder, it will cost you another $10.00 easy. This was just $15.00 because it was out of the plastic store holder. Fast delivery, perfect fit."

I made my station in like 30 minutes. There are great programming tools like up-to-date newscasts, weather reports and podcasts."
3,video for Paul Monette,"Haven't viewed it in months...it is pretty forgettable. He is one of my favorite authors, and I was disappointed by this video. But anything by or about him, in my book, is never a waste of money."
2,"Better than OEM, but too short!","OK, I'm a big tall guy but this is listed as a shoulder strap and if I wear it across my shoulder I can't move the camera. I really wush it was 12"" or more longer. The shoulder pad acts as if it is coated with teflon (tm)!In short: This is a neck strap with a slippery shoulder pad.The little Battery/memory card case is nice."
3,Too bulky for a lighter camera,I bought this for use with my DSC-H5. It's overkill for that camera because the camera is not really heavy enough to justify it. It's a LARGE strap and is pretty comfortable.
4,Definitely worth the price,"I bought this for my Sony DSC-R1 because the small strap that came with the camera wasn't padded. The R1 is a heavy camera, and after carrying it around my neck for a week on vacation, I realized I needed something better. I've had this new strap for a few months now, and have been on vacation twice more with the new one. It's a great strap.It actually makes my camera feel lighter, which really surprised me. I'm guessing it's due to the padding on this strap. It's very comfortable to wear around my neck even if I'm carry the camera for 10 hours a day. My only complaint is that the shape of the strap makes it more difficult to carry the camera on my shoulder than I would like. I've looked at other straps, but for the price, this one can't be beat. I also love the small pouch which allows me to carry extra memory cards."
4,Better than the cheap strap,"I bought this for my DSC-F717 camera. I personally did not like the cheap burlap strap that originally came with my camera. The portion of the strap that wraps around your neck is cushioned and does not bite down like the original strap. I recommend this if you have a ""heavy"" camera like mine and carry it for hour(S). It is over-priced for a strap so shop for the better price. The pouch can hold one battery and one memory stick, though I would not add it to the strap since it would make it more cumbersome."
2,Too short.,"Well constructed strap, but too short. I like to sling the camera under my arm when not in use to protect it against bumps and to keep it out of the way. If the strap was long enough, I would have given it 4 stars. I'm going back to using a $10 Quantary deluxe padded strap."
2,Soap Opera,"This Guy who plays Jack should return to his daytime soap opera. What is this silly acting called excitement at opening a book, secret package, untying someone. And good god, what childish sentimentalism."
3,Not as great as seasons 1-3,"I really enjoyed seasons 1-3 of Lost and then once I got to season 4, I started losing track of what was happening; things got really confusing, and they never explain any of it!! That being said, there's still a lot of great action and suspense that carries you through to the end."
3,"ABC bought out the right, now they dont make sence","LOST is one of my favorite TV shows by far,However, in this season, things dont realy make much sence, and they have the ABC syndrome,(where they stopped filming for like half a year or somthing like that)so the story line is as if the writer was on crack or somthing..."
5,Lost,"Big fan of Lost. The series delivers, however, I guess due to the writer's strike, not as many episodes as in the past."
4,Perfect Workout Series,I started watching Lost as part of my Cardio Workout and it is perfect. I had never seen the series before but heard a lot about it and now I'm hooked. My incentive is that I have to be on the Precore working out to watch the show and it works because the show keeps me interested. I'm looking forward to Season 5 (I just ordered it from Amazon)
5,"""LOST"" ALWAYS has a plan.",Another extraordinary season of LOST. This DVD set in particular is great because of all the bonus features. It's chock full of 'em.
4,Lost Season 4,I was very pleased with this item. I'm living overseas and haven't got to see the more recent episodes. Amazon not only shipped it overseas but it also arrived sooner than expected. The season itself was also very good. :o)
2,Hard to follow,"I guess I must be a total idiot - at least in the opinion of the ardent fans of Lost. I'm finding the never-ending plot twists and new characters so hard to follow that I'm losing interest in the series. The continual twists seem too over-the-top and have taken the show from enjoyable to something that's too complicated and far-fetched to be entertaining. And yes, I bought several seasons and sat and watched them for hours and hours, back-to-back (recovering from surgery). Season four is the first time I've found that the writers seem to be grasping at straws in order to keep the story going. I know I'm in the minority here but unless these many loose threads start knitting together and making sense soon, I'm going to forget about season five.Hopefully, I haven't made any spelling or grammar errors in my review or I'll be absolutely attacked by the 5-star gang for disagreeing with them. Sigh..."
5,Lost: The Complete 4th Season,It was a great experience doing business with. Fast shipping and exactly what I expected. Would definately do business with again in the future.
4,Lost,"I receieved it in excellent condition, I just wished I had receieved it sooner. It took forever!"
5,Entertainment,This show never stops amazing me. There are so many twists and turns and more questions to keep you watching. Gotta love it. :)
5,Lost: The Complete Fourth Season,Great show. I highly recommend the showthe DVD's and the company which shippedthem.
5,LOST season 4,In by opinion this is the best show ever. The only thing better about season 4 is season 5. I am anxiously awaiting its release so I can watch it again.
2,$59.99 for only 14 episodes??? Rip-off.,"Amazon states that the list price is $59.99. That is the same as previous ""Lost"" seasons, which contained 24 episodes each. So why should ""Lost - Season 4"" cost $59.99 for only 14 episodes? Rip-off. ""Season 4"" was excellent and proved ""Lost"" still had some legs, but what's the point in ripping off loyal Lost viewers? No wonder there was a writer's strike last year. Not only does Hollywood rip off its writers/creators, but it also rips off its viewers/customers. Let's hear it for the writers who fought back the bloated Hollywood monster."
5,Another Awesome Season!,"A few episodes shorter than other seasons due to the writer's strike but action packed and full of twists. The writers are brilliant and as usual, deliver some of the best mind blowing episodes ever. Each and every episode is a thrill ride. This season does not disappoint.Every actor/actress gives an outstanding performance, including the new characters from the freighter.The commentaries are fantastic, showing how much goes into making each show. The bloopers and deleted scenes are always fun.Definitely worth the money and a must have season."
3,"Great Season, Bad DVD",I loved this season. For me this show just keeps getting better and better. My only problem was the quality of the DVD's. Disc four skips on me all the time and I can't watch all of the bonus features on disc five because it crashes on me. For what I payed for stuff like this pisses me off.
1,DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER!,"I never received the product and after three attempts to contact the seller for a refund, I had to contact Amazon directly for help in getting my refund. Very shady, beware of this seller! Go with another seller, such a hassle, I am very careful not to purchase anything from Classic Cottage now."
2,LOST MONEY,"I really like LOST too and I never missed one episode, I also have all the dvd's but, I agree with the others who said it is to much money for so few episodes. Look at the TERMINATOR TV series on Amazon $29.95, even cheaper on pre-order Like I said way to much money.........Well, maybe we could pick it up on ebay sometime in Jan. for far less. Like someone else said.....are the writers and the company trying to make us pay for the money they lost from the strike or, maybe they think we just won't notice. I always just buy the copies of lost........this time I'll wait, thank you very much."
2,overpriced tv seasons,"With the writers strike most TV shows were drastically reduced in the number of episodes produced. I don't think that these affected seasons should be the same price as full completed seasons, it just feels like your getting ripped off."
2,Writers Strike~~so BEWARE,You could really tell there was a writers strike going on~~the storyline was scattered and this was made worse by the fact that there were only 15 episodes on this long awaited for 6 disc collection. Why did it take until December to receive this when the first 3 seasons were avalable in September and they had more episodes? Was it because they needed filler? These problems along with no reduction in price made LOST the 4th season a disappointment. We will probably rent season 5 instead of buying unless we can get more bang for our buck.
4,Solid TV,"While I was not such a great fan of the series in the beginning, Lost has shown itself to develop into very solid TV viewing here. While the constant flashbacks are not allways that interesting and are unenecessary, because it is still what is happening on the island that is the most interesting, they only disturb at times. The storyline is tsrong and we get to see what happens to Jack as he is with the Others. Of cuorse the whole thing does end up in an unexpected cliffhanger episode towrds the end but I guess that is necessary. Probably of the more surreal moments in the episodes would not even be necessary since the overall quality is rather high. Also at the moment you can get the whole series quite cheaply."
2,MY GRADE: D plus to C minus.,"What happened to you lost? So much potential, so much mystery and so much tension. It began to unravel somewhere between the second and third season. This was my second attempt watching the series and once again I couldn't get past the second or third episode. Too bad. OVERALL GRADE: D plus to C minus."
2,From a great show to a disaster,"I absolutely LOVED the first two seasons. Then season 3 started off a little bit uninteresting, but towards the end it got better and better. Now season 4... It's almost unbelievable to me, how a good show could have gotten this bad. As is evident by midseason, when they kill off two characters whose story seemed to matter but now apparently doesn't anymore: The writers have absolutely no idea where they are headed. Or if they do, it's not where the show intended to go in the beginning. The 'war' between this millionaire guy and Ben is so uninteresting it almost hurts. What now seems to be the main story is nothing more than a side story from maybe season 3 or so."
5,Dead slow marketing of seaso 4,"Lost is fantastic tale of survival and mystery. Catching it as its broadcast is usually a dismal failure for me, so purchasing it as it becomes available is a sure thing.Having taught survival in public school, I have a feel for the story's authenticity. Like ""Castaway"" with Tom Hanks, it tells the truth of survival. I expect the kids that took my class, especially the weekend foraging portions just eat this stuff up while avoiding the waste of time ""Survivor"" presents.""Lost 4"" came out too slowly. I am waiting for season five and six."
4,"Lost, Season 4","I have been a faithful viewer of Lost since its beginning. I own all four seasons DVD's. They are all great AND SEASON FOUR IS NOT EXCEEPTION.I look forward to the start of season five on the 29 and the special showing of the retro season the 22nd. I would have rated this collection as a five star, but have not viewed it in it's entirety."
1,didnt want to buy,"I never wanted to buy lost season four but a box about connection speed came up and i accepted it. next thing i know, thanks for buying lost season 4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Bottom line = $$$$,"Great season, but charging the same amount (Nearly $40) for only 14 episodes is highway robbery.Not-to-mention that you can watch it online for free.In this age of illegal (though easy) downloads, I've paid for the previous 3 seasons, and was looking forward to this one, but not at this price.Fair is fair."
1,broken,I recieved this product and the first disc had delaminated so it sucked. There is nothing that makes you as mad as getting all set to watch a show and the thing doesn't work
3,blu-ray vs. reg dvd,"So long as you own a blu-ray dvd player or a playstation, you need not waste money on blu-ray movies. I repeat, you need not waste money on blu-ray movies so long as you own a blu-ray dvd player. There is NO difference in picture quality between a regular dvd and a blu-ray dvd when played on a blue ray dvd player or on a playstation. However, they is a major difference in picture quality when comparing regular DVD's played on standard DVD players and blu-ray movies played on blu-ray players.Such is the case w/ Lost season 4. Why pay double the price for Blu-ray? If you already own a blu-ray DVD player or a playstation, don't bother w/ the blu-ray version. That's because blu-ray players UPGRADE regular DVDs to the point that they look imperceptibly alike even on high-def, flat-screen televisions. In my opinion, there is no discernible difference between blu-ray discs and standard discs when played on blu-ray players."
4,"My Least Favorite Season, But Still Awesome","This is the only season of Lost that I am giving four stars instead of five. It is another awesome season overall, and you can't watch the other seasons without watching this one, but I just wasn't as impressed with Season 4 as I was with the rest of the series. There are many great moments, however, and the finale is really good. Season 4 is a different experience compared to the older seasons, but that doesn't make it bad at all. As with the other seasons, I strongly recommend."
5,"Best Show, Season 4 On Par With Series Best!","There's really no need for me to be redundant and go into great detail here. This show is powerfully affecting when taken as a whole as a redemption piece with great storytelling. But many of the flashback/flahsforwards are so well done that they stand on their own and are on their own, very compelling. I can't say enough about this show or give it a higher recommendation!"
5,"Great Show, Great Season",This is a great show and season 4 doesnt dissapoint. The picture quality is stunning and the extras are great. The most interesting one is how they change Oahu to different places around the world. If you like lost you won't be dissapointed.
4,Lost: 4th Season,"As a fan of the TV series, it's easy to rave about it. I don't think I need to add anything else."
4,LOST - Season 4,Excellent excellent season - full of action and twists - much better than Season 3. I didn't put 5 stars because it was so short - only 14 episodes :-(
1,over rated,"i dont know what people are thinking when they say this show is good.This show has sucked from the beginning. It has no direction or plan for the season when you watch it through. It is obvious they are making it up from week to week. I watched the show on and off from the first season to now, they have completely changed the 'rules' of the show from start to now. From the 'security system' to 'the others' and so on.Its a shame as what jj abrams did with alias was masterful. Alias is one the best shows goin around. It has depth, a goal, great characters, and powerful story lines, and substance thats believable . This is why i gave lost a chance. You would never guess its made by the same guy. It sucks big time."
1,LOST ...if you watch this you may loose your mind,"This is absolutely NOT a thinking person's notion of stimulating entertainment, If I were you, I would watch the first and last episode and I sware you won't miss a thing. There's just on thing clear here: They wlll be lost forever ok?, so don't waste your time, or the next one to be lost will be you. It is so incredible boring!! and you know the worse? I am not exagerating!!! Try Prison break and your undestanding of great suspense will be changed forever."
3,You don't know the quality of a company until you have a problem.,"Amazon quickly replaced a bad copy my Fourth Season, LOST, and even refunded my shipping costs! Sometimes stuff happens, but Amazon did not hesitate to help me correct a problem. I had a new set of LOST within a week.Amazon even sent me a return lable, post paid. Now I know I can trust Amazon to ""make it right"" if ever a problem pops up with my future purchases.The replacement set is perfect. No missed pixels. Smooooooth!Here is my flash back-I waited a very long year before the delivery of my Fourth Season, LOST.When it arrived I delved into it with great pleasure. I ignored the ocassional pixel misses, just enjoying the story. Finally on disk two it because impossible to ignore the problems, it wouldn't even load. I tried playing disk two on another DVD player. No hope left, I contacted Amazon via internet and used their easy to follow return/replace page.Good service, no hassel, replacement is great."
3,the problem is with disc # 3,"i am a big fan of lost, and lost 4 is great...the problem is with the dvd itself. disc 3 sticks at the beginning. amazon was great and made good, but it seems the problem is widespread. truth be told amazon has xlnt customer service."
5,Excellent beyond words,The quality of the HD video stream is truly amazing. I joined Amazon Prime and in addition to being able to watch fine quality TV and movies I get free shipping and a Kindle loan book once a month. I have been watching LOST episodes for weeks now and the more I watch the more in awe I am of the entire series.
5,I'd buy THAT for a dollar!!,Or $66.95. Great season and it will be fun to watch especially when all the seasons have come out. This is one of those shows that is really setup for Blu-Ray. Oh and the new additions this year in characters along with great storytelling really put this series back on top! I was a little disappointed with Michael's character development but hey you can't have everything and we still have to see where they are going with that.Looking forward to the release too bad we have to wait till December.
4,Enhanced episodes to count for full 24 episode season?,"Season 4 was incredible and did what Lost has always done, leave me wanting more. But I am disappointed that there was only 14 episodes with 10 enhanced episodes. My feeling is that they will add the enhanced episodes in the DVD set to bring the episode count to 24. Dirty pool in my opinion. Still Season 4 was great!"
2,Still Love the Show,"OK, first of all, I thoroughly love the show itself, but I'm reviewing the packaging of this season. FOUR episodes with audio commentary??????? Four out of an already short 14 episode???????I WILL NOT preorder the next seasons, if I wanted the episodes themselves, I'd go to the ABC online episode viewer. I was paying for the extra stuff. Previous seasons had a lot more audio commentary and that's what I was expecting. Silly me."
4,Great for group activities,"My daughter decided to organize her 11-year Bday party at home, inviting only 5-6 close friends. Besides backyard games and personalized pizza making, I ordered the kit and extra refill set as an activity to keep the fun going. It was perfect. The girls even took their art products home for their own window decoration. Highly recommend!"
1,Worked for about 3 hours,"Made of pretty cheap plastic. We plugged it in on the day we got it, and it wasn't working by the time we went to bed. Not a quality product."
3,Illuminates only body of the spiders,"It looks good when close by, but from 30-40 feet it looks like lights (no spider shape). I wanted to use them on my window to be viewed from outside."
1,Broke,Stopped working after 3 days. Not the fuse. Probably a burned out bulb connected in series (you have to take apart every spider and check every bulb). Now in the trash.
1,Not LED and only 5 spiders,"Despite the description, these are not LED. Inside the 5 rigid plastic spiders are the tiny incandescent Xmas lights. Also note: only 5 spiders, not 20."
1,Very Bad Experience,"I purchase CD through Amazon and this is not a new item but the information said this is a very good condition. Actually when I received it, i found the CD was broken. It doesn't matter but the CD was a copy one and they printed the label stick onto the CD. I couldn't even listen a song is a complete smooth. I am going to return it back to the seller. I am wondering how to control this kind of thing happen again. I have brought a couple of things from Amazon but that's directly from Amazon and I don't have this kind of experience."
2,Not her best work,"I thought that the story line was good in the beginning but then it became to historical and not enough romance. I felt that the way the main characters were always so cruel and mean to each other to be very tiresome. The references to history were too long and too many, I found myself skipping through them after a while. The book kept me interested only because I kept hoping that the cruelity would soon end and they would pronounce their love for one another. The ending was the biggest dissapointment however, it too many unanswered questions about everything and I like to read books that tie up loose ends. This book could use a sequel to help with all the unanswered questions. This is not like any of her other books that I have read."
3,Was she in a hurry?,"This book was decent. But then again, I have not read a romance novel in three months and I was starving for one. Though her books are typically rough and rather tawdry, they are always good. I have been a fan of hers for a long time. However, this book seems rushed and the characters are not completely developed. Frankly I enjoyed the fact that Amalie was not the prettiest woman in the world, as most of RR's women are- and I also liked the fact that she wasnt as hard and jaded as most of RR's heroines. Yet there was something missing in the story- and it wasn't the sensuous dancing of the heroine, which was there as usual. I liked Amalie and Holt, but Rosemary Rogers did not do them justice because she did not go to any lengths to make this story a good one."
1,I should not have wasted my time,"I must say, the author has gone to lunch on this one. The hero (Holt) is a rake, libertine and a vile personality. He hasn't a kind word to say the Amalie. Amalie on the other hand is a dimwit.The story does not go well throughout. There are too many unanwsered questions at the end. Do not waste your time on this trash."
1,Avoid At All Cost,"This is a horrible, horrible book. It does not deliver what readers have come to expect from a good romance novel. First, this novel is full of interesting history that the author does not describe in greater detail. She is a very poor historian and should concentrate more on the romantic part of the plot. All she does is confuse the reader with her vaguely described historical events. Second, the male protagonist is mostly unpleasant and often cruel. Very rarely do we see a soft spot in his heart for the heroine. I was really hoping that there would be a major confession of the ""hero's"" love for the heroine at the end of the story, especially after the way he treats her throughout the book. But no. He never even says the 3 little words we have come to expect at the end (at least) of a good romance novel. We are just supposed to assume he loves her. Very unfulfilling! Third, there are numerous loose ends at the end of the novel. Definitely a book to avoid at all costs."
1,Was this written by Rosemary Rogers?,"I, too, eagerly await new RR novels for the thrill of the developed characters who start at opposite ends and eventually meet each other in the middle, after great angst and misunderstandings, of course. We all know that the novel will end in ""happily ever after"", but it's the journey inbetween that captures us. My reaction to ""In Your Arms"" and the story of Amalie and Holt was lukewarm at best. The story seemed hollow and too programmatic with characters not fleshed out. I had more interest in discovering the story behind Grandmamma than I did the main characters. I also had the distinct impression that the book wasn't really written by Rosemary Rogers, who's stories and characters I have enjoyed since ""The Wildest Heart"" and the Steve and Ginny series. ""In Your Arms"" is definitely not up to Rosemary Rogers' usual standards and I regret that I picked it up looking for a good read."
1,What a disappointment!,"Rosemary Rogers was definitely in a hurry on this one. I am not even sure if the book was about Amalie Courtland and the Earl of Deverell. Except for the steamy love scenes, I am not sure at what time the two developed a relationship. I thought that she might let Amalie's brother spin off into a second novel, but instead his abbreviated story is written into this novel too."
2,Not in My Arms,"I read this book as a way to give Rosamary Rogers a second chance. This is the second of her books I have read and will be the last. First of all someone must not have read the book before they did the art work on the inside cover. First of all the western/Montana scene and dress depicted is not at all what it looks like in New Orleans or Regency England. Ok now to the book. I felt there was too many story lines happening at once, quite frankly i see no reason why the story needed to return to the US. There is really no conclusion where are hero relealizes how he has wronged Amie our heroine, no he just climbs back into her bed yet again and she welcomes him.Holt, our hero treats her like garbage on more then one occasion then ruins her more then once, but never appologizes, heck she never even gets to explain.I felt completely unsatisfied and by the end really couldn't have cared less."
1,Disappointed,"Although I have never read anything by Ms. Rogers, I have heard from others that she is a good author. After getting through this book, I was needless to say very disappointed. Both of the main characters were not interesting, to the point where I did not care about either person. All I can say is do not waste your time."
2,Disappointed,"I'm an avid reader of romance novels and I must say this is the first time I hated the lead male throughout the entire book. Can't say the lead female was any better. I have read Rogers' books in the past and was looking forward to reading this one. I even ordered this in advance -- big mistake. Towards the end of the book when I usually can't seem to get enough of a really good romance novel, I found myself skimming over some very insignifant and boring paragraphs. Did not mind at all when I finally finished it."
4,"Great book, wish I had gotten the whole thing!","I sat down with my daughter to read this book, we were really excited about it! but page 135 is the last correct page. after that, the rest of the book is repeated pages from earlier in the book....we missed out on 6 of the herbs in the book! Apparently, we have passed the time for a full refund, so I'll just have to make do with it, and maybe order another one when we get a chance. Just be aware that it was improperly bound at some point, and they may be sold on here as 'like new'."
3,Spitting Nickels is Over Rated,"This is a good book, but not a great book. 'Nuff said. Email me with questions."
1,Cheap,"This has got to be the cheapest made saw chain I have ever seen. Bought it because it was cheap and guess what? I got what I paid for. Needless to say, won't be another one, couple that with tortoise shipping and this is a total bust."
3,works fine but wears quickly,"I agree with the other reviews about this being a fine product that fits my baby Craftsman chainsaw and cuts fine when new/resharpened. It wears quickly, though. I had an afternoon's worth of wood to cut which probably worked out to be several hours of wood actually being cut. I started with a new blade and ended with one too worn down to be usefully resharpened. For typical ""make a half-dozen cuts to clean up around the yard"" I resharpen after each session and get through a season. I use the little Dremel sharpener system, which works great on this chain."
4,Chainsaw,Straight forward ordering. Arrived on time. No issues. Quality fine. Little tough untangled the chain out of the box but all in all exactly what you would expect.
3,Good beginner gardening book,"This book is a collection of articles on commonly grown vegetables, herbs and fruits. Nothing in here for the gardening pro, except some good storage and cooking tips."
2,Bending new corners,"The sound quality of this recording is excellent, but i just expected more, it was ok."
4,An excellent who/what/how of Astrology today.,"I've read a great many books (including my own) which offer an ""overview"" of astrology, but all of them give one author's point of view only. Phillipson's book offers 30+ perspectives (largely British) and presents them in a clear and unbiased manner, arranged by topic. I'm adding this book to the Recommended Reading List I pass out to all of my students in Client Centered Astrology, and I've made it a part of my own library."
5,cherish every Yourgrau release!,"ever since his amazing debut, A Man Jumps Out of an Airplane, Barry Yourgrau has created a funny/off-beat/very imaginative niche for himself in modern lit, creating maximum images in your head via minimum words (& if David Lynch wrote short-shorts they may sound like this). his new one here is a fun, warped time for the weird kid in you--or you could use it to traumatize the dreams of the obnoxious kid kicking the back of your theater seat ;-) check these cool stories out & then grab B.Y.'s other great books as well; every one from him should be celebrated!"
1,This is one of the worst!,"It is incredulous! How can this even be published? The many stories were disgusting and nonsense. Now, don't get me wrong, I do enjoy nonsense, but it isn't even funny nonsense! What is the matter with this! I think no one should read it! It is a big NO! If you want to read something don't waste your time with this upsidedown madness!"
5,The Mentor Quest,"What great news --- we don't have to find a formal mentoring program or make regular appointments with an older person in order to be mentored! This book refocuses us on the reality that mentors are all around us if we will just open our eyes and look. Ms. Southard's book not only gives us practical suggestions and examples of where to look, it also really shifts us from wishing for help to taking hold of what has alrady been uniquely placed in our lives to lead us. A great soul encourager for both men and women!"
3,Scratchy but cute,This costume is scratchy on the inside... my daughter is 17 months old and small for her age and this is tight on her with clothes under it. She is only 21 lbs but tall.
4,"Nostalgic hits, good price, good sound, no liner notes...","I recall buying the 45-rpm singles of ""My True Love"" and ""Burning Bridges"" and ""What in the World's Come Over You?"" back in Scott's heyday, 1958-'60. His deep baritone was unusual for rock artists of the time, and I always liked distinctive low voices. ""The Way I Walk"" is another of his hits included here, and these are the original versions. As a bonus, you will hear Jack's take on ""Running Scared"", the Roy Orbison classic. He does a nice job, but the track mainly proves that only Roy's version of that one is classic. Scott is the Americanized version of his Italian name, but Jack was actually born in Canada, then raised near Detroit. At least through 2001, he was still singing in clubs. If you recall these chart hits, you'll enjoy hearing them again and this is an inexpensive way to satisfy your craving. Thanks to Curb Records for putting this one out at this price."
2,I Shouldn't Have Bought It,"All I can say is:1) I should have read the reviews about this before I wasted my money.2) This isn't what I was looking for - I wanted the album with the ""Dance Waltz"" intacted like the movie along with the song from Tangrine Dream. Now all I have is that song memorized though I will never be able to listen to it again.3) I find this a very very disappointing album and plan on selling it quite as soon as I can.Unfortunately the orginal US release will never come out again - it is out of print. Hopefully by some grace it will"
1,Disappointed,"I was reading a friend's Facebook note about the 15 albums that stick with you and I was mentally composing my own list and the Legend soundtrack was the first album I thought of. I realized that I hadn't listened to it in years. I had dubbed a copy off of a friend and practically wore that cassette tape out. So, I purchased this CD and was very surprised that I didn't recognize any of the songs on the CD at all. I thought maybe that dub I had wasn't from Legend at all and that I had mis labeled it or that my memory was failing me. Then I came here and saw that there were two soundtracks for this movie. The one I had liked was by Tangerine Dream, apparently. I should have done my research or at least read the other reviews. I just wouldn't have imagined that there would be multiple ""Original Soundtracks"" for the same movie. :("
1,I'm not from England. Not the music I was looking for.,"When I saw the movie, it had a score by Tangerine Dream. I have a copy of that soundtrack on cassette. I wanted to replace it with CD. I purchased this cd and was completely bummed. It's a great CD. But not what I was looking for. I loved legend when it came out. Love the Tangerine Dream score. I really liked the Brian Ferry song, Is your love strong enough. Also missing is the ""theme"" song by Jon Anderson from Yes."
2,Review of Legend Soundtrack,"I was disappointed upon receiving this CD. I was expecting the one that is specifically with Tangerine Dream. When I realized & looked that one up, it is OUTRAGEOUSLEY priced!!! WHY??? Tangerine Dream isn't anymore popular than alot of other music, if not that popular or well known at all!! I can get Pink Floyd CD's, Enigma, or One AD at reasonable prices...Is there any other resource I can look at to purchase the CD..Legend with Tangerine Dream?? Thanx for your time & listening..Sherry~"
1,11. The Dress Waltz ( different song entirerly),"The year is 1985,these songs I never heard in the movie,their completely different. I purchased this album so I could hear 'The dress waltz',with the eerie circus like music that put chills up your spine,but what I got was a totally different song entirely,and the rest of the music soundtrack is completely unrecognizable. I play the movie and try to compare the music from the soundtrack album at the same time,totally two different songs entirely. Back then, V.H.S. video was just coming out and you didn't have the luxury of buying the actual movie,this is a major 'scr** job' by this production company,be ashamed of your selves.........."
1,THIS IS NOT THE ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK,"THE ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK WAS DONE BY TANGERINE DREAM. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ""IS YOUR LOVE STRONG ENOUGH""----WHICH IS SUPPOSE TO BE THE MAIN THEME SONG FOR THE MOVIE, DONE BY TANGERINE DREAM WITH BRIAN FERRY---WELL, IT AIN'T HERE. VERY DISAPPOINTING. A BIG WASTE OF MY HARD EARNED MONEY."
5,I fine-tuned and improved my health program with this book!,"I had been diagnosed as diabetic and had extrememly high cholesterol and triglycerides. Robert Baumann's book helped me understand the relationship between pH balance, and potassium/sodium balance and overall glandular function and blood sugar levels. I had lowered blood sugar and triglycerides significantly by using ""The Zone"" diet, but did not fully understand the relationship of pH, pulse, temperature and sodium/potassium balance. His guidelines helped me use supplements and monitoring to further lower my blood sugar and balance my pH levels, which also eliminated my allergies and the need for allergy medications. I have gained a great amount of valuable understanding and control of how the body works and heals itself, and am able to test and monitor many important aspects of my health myself at home. Hats off to Robert Baumann for making it easy and simple, and for empowering us with very useful information!"
4,Additional Input for this book,"Missing how-to information for certain projects pictured in the book , that lack instruction, are from the first (?) book : Seashore Style- Decorative Ideas Inspired by the Spirit of the Seashore. Rustic, beautiful, inspirational - however, to me, not always sensible or usable. Yet, if you have access to a beach, the fun you will have!"
4,Another fine serving of mini-orchestral indie pop,"Aqueduct's latest takes the formula that worked so well on ""I Sold Gold"" and expands it with improved production and additional instrumentation. These twelve songs are humorous, heartfelt, and catchy as heck all at the same time. Standouts include Living a Lie, Keep It Together, As You Wish, and With Friends Like This, which will certainly make for an awesome show-ender, as it just drips with syrupy synth goodness. Highly recommended."
5,or give me death,"I notice reviews from ""aqueduct"" fans who love the new album ""or give me death"" encourage other fans to buy the album and also try to see the live shows. I would ditto that. ""aqueduct"" is David Terry and I think he is awesome. If you've seen an ""aqueduct"" show, then you're aware that Dave just lets the show go where it is already headed. You never know the final destination but you can trust that it's somewhere good and he takes the audience there with him. I've been going to David Terry's live shows since he was in the [...]. But then I would know all about them. I'm his mom."
2,-3 for crooked screws,"I was in need of a new desk chair and one that didn't have arms so it could slide under the desk perfectly. After reading up on the reviews, I decided to purchase this one. It arrived at my house in a timely fashion and I started to assemble it this past weekend. However, I ran into a major issue! One of the screws I needed to loosen seemed to be glued into the chair. I tried everything I could with my handy dandy tools but no luck. In the end, my dad took it to his car mechanic who managed to unscrew it and also gave me brand new screws so I wouldn't have to deal with a stubborn one.A simple assembly process turned out to be a nightmare!"
5,Great Band,"Even thought Dover is a great band and has great music, they do not have much fame. In the US and Northern Europe most people don't know what this band is. If you are looking for a radical band to discover, this is it. Late at Night is their best CD of all. All the song are distinct and most songs are good, unlike their other CD's which had some good song but also bad ones. The weird thing is that they sing in English, but it isn't famouse at all in the English speaking countries such as US and England. On the other hand, it has tons of fans in places like Spain, Portugal, France, and others."
5,A Great CD,"I think this si a great band, they have a very own style of Grunge, but with a lot of influences of nirvana, i loved it."
1,Wrong charger-how to tell,"Ditto Denise's review. We, too, have a L'il Quad, single 6-volt. I was concerned this charger might not fit after reading the reviews but was unable to get anywhere with the Powerwheels website or customer service. So I ordered it-- no fit with or without the adapter. I went to their specified service dealer (25 miles away) and here's the deal: If your L'il Quad has a BLUE BATTERY this charger will NOT work. He's ordering me the right one. I don't know how else to get one. Annoying!"
1,Wrong Connector,We mispalced the charger for my son's Lil Quad and bought this Fisher Price replacement charger. The package says it is for their 6-volt batteries. We brought it home and it had the wrong connecting end on it. It came with a adapter but it was still the wrong end. Luckily we found the old connector and returned the new one.
3,Cute toy but came defective,I got these for my son. They are really cute trains but they came not working. I had to change the batteries and they still didn't work properly. When I get a new item I shouldn't have to change the batteries. When we did change the batteries the moo wouldn't go off every-time expected. We return and go a new one that worked fine but did have to change the batteries again.
1,The cow that does not Moo!,"I bought the Sodor Dairy cars to give to my grandson on Easter however, the toy did not work. When the child opens the door, the cow is supposed to Moo, but this one was mute!!!!!! I already returned it."
5,Fun,"Our grandson really loves playing with this as it not only makes the noise when the door is slide over but the milk can is able to be moved around and placed in other Thomas train cars or trucks.The noise is not really a great sounding one, as one might be pressed to ID it as from a cow but the grandson still enjoys it."
1,"Boring, disjointed, and disorganized collection of essays; not authorized by Gonzalez","As a former Green candidate for Congress, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book when it first came out. My friend had been in San Francisco at the time of Matt's historic campaign, but she was not so interested in buying the book. I soon found out why. It is a painful read, and I gave up half-way through. I gave the book to my friend, who had since moved back to San Fran, and that's when she told me that the author was a(n) (alleged) Gonzalez groupie/stalker, and that this book was not even authorized by the candidate, nor particularly appreciated by him. All in all, this was a waste of money when I bought it, and it didn't even have a re-gifting value. Avoid it."
3,A blast from the past,"Recently I found myself wondering why the Ray Charles Singers pretty much fell off the planet. They were very popular when I was growing up. This album had a pretty steady rotation on my parents' console record player. I even choreographed a dance to Satin Doll in junior high school.Well, now that I have listened to it again, I think I know why we don't hear them any more.Choral harmony has undergone a huge transformation moving into the 21st century. A capella has a kind of geek-chic charisma all its own, particularly when it's a little more raw and passionate. To my 21st-century ear, Ray Charles harmonies are very controlled, very staccato. Maybe even a bit Stepford. I still enjoy Satin Doll but that's about it. This one did not transition well, sad to say."
1,What a load of crap,"I got this product for my girlfriend for christmas, and when she opened it, she was delighted. I also purchased a plethora of stones for her to place. While the transaction with the seller was an excellent experience, the quality of the product was complete garbage. There are many other stud setters out there, and I recommend anyone looking for this type of equipment seek a different one. The quality of the construction is cheap plastic, and cheap metal parts. Nine out of ten times, when she pressed down the mechanism to set the stone or stud, the prongs wouldn't go through t-shirt type material all the way, and if they did, they would not bend the teeth the correct way. She had more luck setting the stones with her fingers, and bending the teeth with a spoon."
5,Great,BeDazzler and a cute denim jacket from a thrift store was the best gift I got my daughter for her birthday this year! She loves it. Perfect for the tweener!!!!
1,Beazzler,"Wouldn't recommend - I doubt that this product was new since everything inside was loose. Much less gems then I expected, I just am not the less bit impressed - in fact, haven't even used it."
4,Blunts.Broad's and Beatz,"I must say grouch came through with this one! No dought Headz wont appreciate this , with out a dought. Grouch to me is a favorite Mc because he tries real hard to bring both his beatz and lyrics to play and this really helps when sleeping on an album! Werd life , preview the cd and buy it , check out the others too_murs_living legends_scarub_eligh_cmapeace yo,"
2,not a must have!,The movie was interesting but could not whole my attention. If you just want a girl on girl movie then get it. But if your looking to be entertain do not buy it
1,Awful,Awful. I bet he wouldn't feel the same way had he ever stayed at one of his hotels without people knowing it was him. Then he would get a real taste of how rude and pomous his employees are to the average person. I had a gold loews card - not anymore. Especially after this book.
5,DESPERATE HOUSEWiVES - SEASON 4 (=,"THE 4TH SEASON WAS GREAT. THE LAST EPiSODE, MY JAW LiTERALLY DROPPED.OF COURSE, i STARTED WATCHiNG SEASON 5, AND FOR THOSE OF YOU D.H. FAN'S WHO DiDNT GET TO iT YET - YOUR DEF. iN FOR A TREAT! (=ENJOY!A.T <3"
5,my soap opera,I enjoy watching to see what next and how desperate the housewifes are.amazon has the best price on all my seres and movies.
5,sizzling secrets and even juicier,"This is the best season of Desperate Housewives YetThe sizzling scenes and interesting stories make it a wonderful combination of comedy,drama,thriller and even horrorthis great mix paid off and I Guarantee you'll enjoy Every minute of it you have to get the first 3 seasons they are a ""must have seasons"""
3,a very disappointing end!!!!,"I liked everything,this season is funnier than ever, but the end is disappointing!!!! 5 years jump in a glimp and then a short exaplanation of where season five will pick up!! i am totally lost :S"
1,Desperate housewives season 4,"Ok but disc 2 wouldn't work in the DVD player so missed half of the series.Cover wasnt in the best condition, but was ok."
5,Desperate Housewives 4th Season,Received this DVD series in plenty of time to wrap for a Christmas present. The recipient was thrilled to get it as a gift. It played well without any defects.
5,Birthday Gift,"My daughter was delighted to receive this for her birthday. She is collecting the complete Series. As usual, Amazon is the place to purchase gifts that arrive on time and are in perfect condition!"
4,desperate housewifes,"i ordered season 4 and got season 5,, so now i have 2 season 5's and no season 4..and i do not know how to return it..."
2,were they a copy?,"I love Desperate Housewives! However, the item I received was refunded for due to the fact that the discs were in flimsy plastic sheath sleeves such as those one uses for their own personal copies."
1,Desperate Housewives,Cant use the dvd's you sent the USA region 1 to our Europe address Region 2 and its too expensive on duty to return them
1,WORST EVER,NEVER RECEIVED IT. WISH I HAD KNOWN THE SELLER WAS DISHONEST AND NOT GOOD AT COMMUNICATING!!!! I MIGHT AS WELL JUST GO BUY THE DVD AT THE STORE!!! VERY VERY DISPLEASED.
5,I'm Desperate for More Housewives!!,"Everything you'd Expect from Desperate Housewives,and MORE!!It get's better and better!! Caution:This show is ADDICTING :)"
1,a lot of missing songs.,there are a lot of missing songs in this audio cd. if you have watched the dvd movie you will notice that there were a lot of good songs omitted in this cd version. they should have put out a two cd box set to feature all the songs and soundtrack of the movie. very disappointed.
3,Good pictures and technical information but poorly written .,"The concept behind this book was badly needed. Chase has become a a hot collectible but few people know much about it. For those who don't, this book should shed a lot of light on the subject. Most of the pictures(taken by individual collectors)is good. However, the text is poorly written-too informal(we're not talking beanie babies here) and exclamation points are thrown all over the place.The overview on the Art Deco movement is weak. There is not much information here one would not find in previous books on Chase-books written far better. Incidently, there is no information here on Chase lamps."
4,a good interesting look,i didnot know about this book but . the more about pierre the more enthralled iam . he was a giant .
2,Waste of My Time,"As several others have stated, Gerber was excessively wordy in this management tome. If you want a good alternative, I'd recommend Sam Carpenter's Work the System instead. Although Carpenter was repetitive, at least I got a lot out of it that I'm using in my business. I can't say that I picked up one useful idea from Gerber's lengthy book."
2,Well...I got something out of it,"I've read E Myth Revisited and have taken tons from it. I purchased E Myth Mastery audio book and listened to it in between PHX and LA on a drive...the loooongest drive I've ever been on! There are some tid bits to pull from this book, as with any. I was disappointed in having to listen to what I believe is Michael's desire to be a drama fiction writer rather than the biz writer he is. I bulled my way through the audio book, fast forwarding as little as possible. I'd get this from the library if you're really interested rather than a purchase. If you do read it...am I the only one who doesn't understand why he didn't simply file for bankruptcy? I mean really, was it worth the hassle/nightmare? He could still have paid his debtors off after the BR rather than go through ALL of the stuff he did."
5,I wish to have read 20 years ago,"We learn by different ways and words, to me sometimes one phrase has the value of a full 200 pages book, it can click my mind to a different view or action. Grate, grate, book for someone that want to create small or grate big business. If you know to use that, you probably have a 7 figure income. It is a technical book sometimes difficult to stay in it but, goes to the bones, he is trying to give a receipt, but need work, hard work. Systematic formulation and, work the business, not in business, maybe be the ground for success of most good size business today, and most of the time is forgotten."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I was very much looking forward to read this book as the book ""Emyth Revisited"" was amazing!!!!!This book basically takes the original book ""Emyth Revisited"" and combines it with a very boring marketing book which you can find in any university.I had to force myself to even get half through.I insist, the original book(Emyth Revisited) is great but apart from repeating interesting points from that book, nothing new has been said.... hence a very disappointing book and its a shame for authors to write a book just for the sake of selling it."
1,Can't believe I'm writing this...,"I am a big proponent of Michael Gerber, and agree with most of his observations which I read and have re-read in the Emyth Revisited. It is my policy that my new clients must agree to purchase and read the Emyth Revisited - or I won't take them on. That book to me is that good. So I was very interested in ordering the CDs for his latest venture.All I will say is this. There were 6 hours of CDs to listen to. However, they have about 2 hours worth of very good information in them. They are VERY VERY wordy. And I had to force myself to continue to listen.I say, pass on this CD, don't purchase the book - AND purchase the Emyth Revisited. Unless, at some point the book and CD are re-edited."
2,He must need the money.,"Michael Gerber must need money. His ""The E-myth Revisited"" is the best book on small business I have ever read. I give it to my customers as gifts. I ran to the book store as soon as I learned he had a new book out. What a disappointment. ""E-Myth Mastery"" is a grueling read and a collossal waste of time. It is full of useless psycho-babble, and convoluted and incomprehen-sible plans and charts. No one would ever actually do this stuff. And his protege, ""Sarah"" - who was overused in the first book and was it's only weak part - is downright annoying in this one. Buy the first ""E-Myth"" and read it over and over. Leave the new one on the shelves. Try again, Michael."
5,Michael Gerber Delivers a Winner Again,"This books ranks up there with E-Myth Revisited. Once again, Michael Gerber delivers a winner and a holy grail! He writes out a structure/foundation for the seven essential habits for running a business: Leadership, Marketing, Money, Management, Client Fulfillment, Lead Conversion and Lead Generation. Do not forget to go to the book website and download the worksheets. Use this book as a textbook on how to run and operate a business and you will not regret. Do not read this book like you read a novel, it is not that kind of a book. Like E-myth Revisited, this is a book that you will refer time and time again and you will need to read this book more than once if you are serious of operating a business. Like Michael Gerber says ""Work On your business, not in your business"".This book was written in 2005 before the huge rise of the internet social media. This book needs to be updated with a section on that. Still, this book is still a great read."
4,"Good, but not the masterpiece E-Myth Revisted is","My reading of E-Myth Mastery kind of stalled half way through. It is a good book, for sure, but it just didn't hold my attention enough to continue. perhaps I expected too much, having just completed Michael Gerber's E-Myth Revisited, which was excellent."
2,Overly verbose,"Seems like there is a lot of ""stuff"" in here that could just be boiled down to ""know your market and make sure your product is service is actually valuable""."
1,psycho-babble,"psycho-babble, this was horrible. I've been listening to audio style cds to and from work for 3 years now this is the first one I actully turned off it was so bad."
1,Disappointingly Worthless,"I REALLY wanted to like this book. I read the E-Myth Revisited and loved it, but this book let me down big time. The whole book is basically a bunch of babbling about how he couldn't figure out a problem and how he worked it over and over in his head and couldn't figure it out. There's a lot of words in this book, but I found nothing of value.I'd recommend sticking withThe E-Myth Revisited: Why Most Small Businesses Don't Work and What to Do About Itand being satisfied with that. I highly recommend that book!"
1,Please Stop!,I felt like I was reading some seedy Romance novel the way Mr. Gerber fawned all over his imaginary Sarah...He creeped me out more than actually provide relevant (and accessible) materials. Ughhh.
3,Beyond a technician,"Another follow-up and an extension to Michael Gerber's original bestseller: E-Myth. The premise is the same: most small businesses are started by technicians - someone who enjoys and excels at a certain task - but unfortunately, this is often not enough to build a successful enterprise. In this book, Michael Gerber walks through marketing, positioning, leadership, and vision exercises with the reader. If your reading list already includes any of the above topics, you will see a large overlap in content. If you haven't read the original E-Myth, go pick it up now, but if you have, you might want to hit the marketing and leadership sections of your bookstore instead - diversity helps."
4,the best.,so convenient and sometimes the blades dull out quickly and give you ugly cuts. be sure to have backup slicers but other than that its great!
5,Circut 29-0001112 Trimmer,"Great price and its perfect size to carry around, light weight, great for small projects and scraping booking or card making. can't beat the price. I love it."
4,Good Trimmer for Price,"I consider this to be a very good trimmer for the price. It has a good, sharp blade and it is larger than I expected. It's very light and moves around easily so you have to hold it down to use. I was only able to slide in one piece of paper at a time. However, if I lifted the ruler I could fit in 1 or 2 more pieces of paper and it could cut all 3 simultaneously."
2,Bad!,"I am surprised people like this awful paper cutter! It cuts paper just like as if you were to fold the paper and tear it, leaves a jagged edge. Don't buy this, spend the extra $5 or less and get a Fiskars one. Their trimmers are better quality and give a nice clean cut. It works, cuts paper, but you do not want to use it for a project were the cut edge will show. If you just want to cut 12x12 in half to use with your cricut then it would work."
2,Not that great..,I wasnt very happy with this. It was pretty flimsy. I would reccomend spending a luttle more and getting one from Creative Memories.
2,I need a new paper cutter!!!!,"Unfortunately, this is the only paper cutter I own.I actually own two because at one point the replacement blades were more expensive than to buy the whole thing again.I do a lot of scrap booking and card making and this blade becomes dull very quickly.My card stock is very thick and sometimes this leaves *not so nice looking* edges on my paper.I DO like the fact that my paper always comes out even and straight.I DO like the ruler that comes out of the side.I DO like the fact that the blade is easy to change and the main ruler opens very easily.I use a lot of home made paper and it cuts very nicely on MOST of them.I need something a little sharper and more reliable because some of my papers cost $7.50+ a sheet.If anyone has any good recommendations please let me know!!"
2,Mehh,You have to snap the plastic bar down every time you want to cut something. It slows you down. Not very efficient.
5,Gift is Well appreciated,I got this as a gift to mom. The trimmer works so well that she relies on it totally. The scoring tool is so great as well.
2,Tough One!,"I like the fact that I can cut things quickly. This is okay, but, if you don't hold down the cutter bar, your paper slides leaving an un-even cut; this is frustrating even for my children!"
1,CRAP,"junk, don't waste your money on this one. doesn't cut a single sheet of photo paper. Poor design, flimsy crap (you get what you pay for). Zero stars"
5,cool trimmer,works great! the scoring blade is cool but you'll still need to use a bone folder. I had on similar to the cricut trimmer but the groove got too rough and the cuts wound up crooked. Hopefully this will last...
4,Students Enjoyed It,We viewed this after reading The Tempest. The movie is well done and faithful to the play. This is a worthwhile purchase.
2,It all could have been more than it is now.,"MTX is very notable for their special blends of pop-punk, and can pretty much sing about anything: girls, adjectives, Love Connection, and even Velveeta cheese. In recent years, Dr. Frank has been experimenting with new, ""lighter"" sounds, such as on the EP ""The Miracle of Shame""... but this time, he's taken it too far. The overdose of keyboards and organs really take away from the songs... hence why ""She's Not A Flower"" is one of the few tracks that I can actually listen to all the way through. The songs have great potential, if only they had not been so watered down as they are. You'd really be better off with albums such as ""Love is Dead"", ""...and the Women Who Love Them"" (special edition)"", ""Big Black Bugs Bleed Blue Blood"", or even ""Night Shift at the Thrill Factory""."
2,There are better videos out there,"I really tried to listen and learn from this video but the video was poor in content, dry, and the speaker was a bore. The speaker looked like he'd rather be eating glass than talking to the crowd and put up charts that look like spaghetti and says....""Buy right here, you see??"" I learned absolutely zero, I'm upset I paid money for it. To be more specific about the video, all I can honestly think of to tell you about with regards to the last hour of looking at the charts presented was the revelation...""Buy right here when the stock bottoms and the volume goes up"".. No flow, totally sporadic content."
2,Save your Money,"Vip is not V.I.P the TV show. This game it not even OK to buy.1.Frist you can't pick who you want to be.2. You can't fight any way you wanted. (You have to fight how the game wants you to fight)3. You can't move, Run or do anything on your own.4. Graphics and sould could be a little better.I love the TV show V.I.P but this is not anything like it.Believe me. Just say NO to V.I.P the game. Save your Money.But if you want to spend your money on this game?Do not say I didn't worn you."
1,Only Good for the Pamela picture on Cover...,"4 words: This game is horrible! The game gives you direction on how to fight & then they only give you 1 second (literally) to respond to the comands. If you dont respond in time, you're pretty much dead. The graphics are also pretty bad. One good thing about the game, you never run out of lives. Unlimited continues. As the other reviwer stated, you can run, jump or walk by yourself, the game is all computerized to do that by its self. Good for a collectors item, but nothing eles."
1,HORRIBLE!!,"this game is so frustrating!!! the fight sequence is so repetative, you dont have the freedom to control your player, and all you do is press sequences of buttons to attack when it shows up on the screen! its so annoying that the entire time your playing your just doing the same thing over and over!! after 5 minutes of playing i turned it off! DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!! IT SUCKS!!"
3,ALRIGHT,V.I.P FOR PLAYSTATION IS FUN BUT THE WAY THE CONTROLS IS CAN BE A PAIN BUT U GET USED TO IT AFTER A WHILE JUST TRYING TO DO KEEP UP WITH IT THOUGH CAN GET FRUSTRATING AND U CAN BE LIKE GETTING THE CRAP POUNDED OUT OF YA BY 5 GUYS
3,Little kids will love this one!,"I had a good time with this game. You are Mogli and you have to dance your way through the forest. You dance against all of the characters in the Jungle Book story through 8 levels. The music is the best feature. I found myself tapping my toes more than once. The vulture song was my favorite. It is pretty fun, and you can set the desired difficulty range so you can make it as challenging as you like. The game can be played in the story version, which has clips from the movie to propel the game forward. I would not want to own this one, but I did enjoy the hour or so that I spent with it."
1,Disappionting!,"I am a big Animorphs fan, and as an Animorphs fan, I tried to like this game, I really did, but it was just AWFUL! The plot is fairly cheesey, the sounds and graphics are bad, even for Game Boy, and the game itself is just like a bad Pokemon game with Animorphs slapped on the cover.Don't be fooled! Don't waste your money on this game, buy a few Animorphs books instead. This game is a WASTE OF MONEY!"
4,"Animorphs, great game.","This is my second favorite game in my gameboy pack.(#1 is pokemon gold)It's a great game, and the graphics are alot better than I thought they would be.If you like animorphs, you should buy this game.Hope this helps."
2,Don't Be Fooled!,"I am an Animorphs fan so I bought this game, but this game is not much like Animorphs. It is more like a cheap copy of Pokemon! You battle aliens with different attacks. The attacks can lower defence, lower accuracy, lower attack power, or weaken the alien. Besides that, the game is really hard to save and the directions aren't clear. Don't be fooled Animorphs fans!"
5,My kids,"My kids are fans of the series and do enjoy the game very much. Don't expect next generation graphics or play here, this is a typical gameboy color offering, it would be nice if they made and Animorphs for Advance, but for now, this is the best there is."
2,Beware Of This Game!,"I am an Animorphs fan, so I bought this game thinking it would be fun. I was wrong. The directions aren't clear so you don't know what you have to do in the first level, which is the level I am stuck on. I don't know what I have to discover or do to get to the next level. I can't do anything on it and it has become boring. Don't buy the game if you want to be entertained! Beware, Animorphs fans, beware!"
2,Entertainingly HORRIBLE!,"This game was a real disappiontment for Animorphs fans. The graphics are smudgy and in the first level, you just wander around aimlessly."
2,Pointless,"I really don't like this game! It's graphics are really OK, but the plot is very pointless. You go looking for....... well you don't even know. I 've had the game for about 1 year, and every time I pick it up, feeling I can beat the level, I can't. It's a real waste. Like I said, I'd give the graphics about a 4, but that's the only good thing about it that I can find."
5,A Butterfly Museum,"This book along with the photo essay book ""Costa Rica : The Last Country the Gods Made"" should be owned by anyone who loves Costa Rica, even if they think they despise nature studies as dry and limited. Buy it just for the color plates. This book's spirit is undeniable."
3,The Butterflies of Costa Rica,"After traveling different countries and using various field guides, I can say that this one needs a lot of improvement. This book only covers a small section of species. The specimens that are used are tattered and some are difficult to use for ID purposes. In most guides, the photo description on the left usually include the page number for the text, this one doesn't. So, you have to check the name and look to the index to cross over to the text page. Speaking of names, they are only called by the Latin scientific name. This is probably not a big issue since most do not have one.Now, the text is very thorough and there have been a great deal of time and patience to acquire the information and data. I still would recommend this book despite its flaws. So far, it is probably the only book describing Costa Rican Butterflies."
3,just average,"I really like the versatility of the pack, but the plastic hinges squeak in cold weather, especially if there are numerous items in the pack, making it heavy."
2,Spacious but not a Laptop bag,It got lots of space to put in things....but its not a laptop bag...It does not have any kind of protection for the laptop....no padding on any side....i returned this back immediately and got a new one...
1,Not Real Publishing,The quality if very poor. It appears to be a badly photocopied set of papers--not a real book--and has photographs that seems to be the result of copies of copies of copies (etc.) that are very nearly illegible. I do not recommend.
5,Eyes of Eagles,"Even though I had read the book before, I would suggest it as reading material for anyone that loves westerns. WJW weaves history into fiction within his books. His style is such that if one closes their eyes the imagery makes one believe they are within the story with the characters."
4,Eight Days Of Glory,"I am an Alamo fanatic, and I make no excuses fof it. Mr Johnstone's story of a young man raised by Indians who becomes one of the Alamo defenders is one of my favorites, and when I saw it offered on tape, there was no hesitation in ordering a copy. My only disapointmentment is in the editing(of course, that's what ""abridged"" means, isn't it?), and I would love to see a full length version on tape someday. Until then, this is an excellent adventure story that can be enjoyed by anyone not offended by the obvious violence associated with the legendary struggle for Texas independance. REMEMBER THE ALAMO!"
5,"Do buy this for great music, but not for sonic upgrade","Everybody should know by now how great these records are. I own the Discovery-issued of each, and bought this on the promise/assumption of better sound...I personally don't feel that the sound is better. In fact I don't believe I can discern any real difference(s). If you own the earlier issue, you might still buy this to satisfy your curiousity, and then I suggest doing the right thing: give it away to turn someone on to this great music."
5,BARR,"I first heard Barr on Kill Rock Star's web page, and thought that it was really annoying. After a while, however you can see where the lyrics are incredibly meaningful, and the songs are catchy in a way. Some songs can be a bit bland, but it's all a part of the art project Brendan Fowler created."
4,Good 'n' country,"This is a great cd if you're looking for some of today's hits. It could feature a few more songs, but the ones that are here are great. I will listen to this cd over and over!"
2,Just OK,"This was for my husband, and he didn't care for it. I am not a huge country fan, but I tolerate it, and this was barely tolerable."
3,3 Stars because,It was kind of slow in spots:I am still reading it but I thought that it lacked in certain areas for a first novel of telling how the MEG actually worked but I did think that there were areas that were truly scary and could be put to reality if attempted but I also digress on and in that area. I notice that in the real notes that the Author is a media whiz of sorts and I'd like to know how to get ahold of him.
5,Must Have!!!,"This book, is well written and thoroughly researched. The author has taken the time to aquaint us with the ingredients and equipment that every baker uses. Regan Daley streses the importance of knowing our ingredients and the purpose that they serve in our recipes. Just following a recipe really is not enough! I believe that anyone that bakes should become familiar with this book."
4,A very good reference,"An essential for the beginning baker or even more experienced hands this book provides not just a list of items or ingredients but clear explanation of the role played by each item. For the beginning baker it is great with flavour pairing charts that takes the agony of reinventing wheel away and provides definite opinions of ingredients such as, instant yeast (no) to chocolate (minimum 65-70% cacoa liquer for bittersweet).The layout and design is done well though I would have liked to have had a complete recipe index/list and not simply general chapter headings e.g., cakes and tea cakes which then breaks into the individual recipe listings. The only other niggle I can think of is not providing a recipe for producing one's one almond paste and marzipan, but that is a minor detail.Highly recommended for those who want a reliable, quick reference that has some very good recipes and a good eye for detail."
5,This book is indispensible....,"These recipes are good enough to use as a foundation for a catering business, they are truly that good and that well tested. Every recipe is foolproof. And every recipe is truly delicious.Owning lots of cookbooks and with a ready made house full of 4 kids critics, this book has become indispensible.Thank you Regan Daley for putting forth the effort necessary to making this book stand out in its very crowded field."
5,Excellent baking resource,"Regan Daley's book has two parts: a resource guide for dessert bakers and a section of recipes. I've read the first part and it looks like a useful summary of hardware, ingredients, substitutions, etc. I haven't used it as a reference yet, so my review is heavily biased toward the second section. This I find very impressive. There are many cookbooks out there that provide recipes for simple, homey desserts and many that cover elaborate presentation dishes. Daley's recipes fit very nicely in between these two extremes. The recipes tend to take classic concepts -- spice cake, fruit tart, etc. -- and apply them to original desserts that are excellent marriages of flavors that are not forced or ackward. The recipes are well tested; I have not had a failure with one yet. I highly recommend this book for enthusiastic home bakers."
2,a disappointed baker in st paul,I really wanted to love this book--the glossary alone is well researched and the recipes sound great. But beware. I've just tried two recipes; Chocolate Hazelnut Biscotti and Old Fashioned Lemon Bundt Cake. Both turned out badly; the biscotti dough was way too dry to even form logs and the glaze on the cake is just weird and gloppy. 2 1/2 tbls. lemon juice does not melt 1 1/2 to 2 cups of confectioner's sugar. Maybe this volume is useful for the info on ingredients only.
4,A good resource on ingredients and techniques,"Having been cooking for 40+ years, I still found some information I had not been able tofind before about some ingredients. It doesn't have every possible recipe, like springerle, but certainly a good assortment. One repeated mistake, however, made me doubt the accuracy of the author until I had confirmed, by careful reading, that I agreed with enough other details. Someone please tell Ms. Daley that New Zealanders were called Kiwis long before anyone ever re-named a chinese gooseberry as a ""Kiwi"". And that a passionfruit is not the size of a Kiwi. A Kiwi is a flightless bird and the body of a small, newly hatched one is about the size of a coconut........not a passionfruit."
2,Meh,"Good book for info/reference. Recipes are long but okay, disappointed at the lack of pictures. Definitely not for you if you like to have a pic of what it should look like!"
4,Works great,"Some early problems with opening cans, but after several tries learned how to properly puncture can lid while maintaining bite on the rim - great portability and holds charge for many openings. Bought one for mom and she likes it."
1,Total JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I have had this can opener less than a year and the battery will not hold a charge. Even if I leave it plugged in, this junky can opener will not open even 1 can. STAY AWAY from this one. I am very disappointed in Black and Decker with this product."
2,Great while it lasted,"I see that the previous reviewer gives a how-to on turning this into a battery-powered one and I will definitely try it but, this little Gizmo died in two years and the fact that you have to do this DIY to make it last longer isn't so great in my book."
2,Opens cans,"This does open cans, but it isn't the best. If the contacts get dirty it won't charge and won't open up your cans. It is somewhat slow and the magnet isn't very powerful. The wife uses it, but when I open up a can I stick with a manual can opener."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS CRAPPY PRODUCT!!!!!,"I BOUGHT THIS TO REPLACE MY CD-BURNER THAT DIED. I BOUGHT IT BECUASE IT WAS ON SALE. IT DIDN'T WORK. I RETURNED IT, AND GOT ANOTHER ONE. IT TOO DID NOT WORK. I CALLED PLEXTOR, BUT BECUASE IT WAS A FRIDAY, I HAD TO WAIT UNTIL MONDAY TO CALL. WHEN I CALLED ON MONDAY, I WAITED ON HOLD FOR 6 HOURS AND 27 MINUTES, AND WHEN I GOT SOMEONE, THEY ALMOST DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH, AND THEY SAID THERE WAS NOTHING THEY, NOR I COULD DO, AND BECUASE I HAD TO WAIT UNTIL MONDAY TO RETURN IT, THE PLACE I BOUGHT IT FROM WOULDN'T TAKE IT BACK BECUASE IT WAS A FINAL CLEARANCE!!!!!P.S. THE ONLY REASON I EVEN GAVE IT ONE STAR IS BECUASE, 1. YOU CAN'T CHOOSE ZERO STARS, AND 2., BECUASE IT LOOKED COOL."
2,Good graphics hard game,"i liked the graphics of this game but the game itself is harder than life. i found the controls to be quite disturbing and hard to manuver in. it get's really annoying when you almost beat the level and die and have to restart the whole thing over again. i couldn't even beat the 2nd level!!! the game does have it's good points. it is fun w/ gameshark and the graphics are beyond this world, but the difficulty and controls are bad."
3,Nice Graphics...Average Gameplay,"This is your typical spaceship shooter game. When playing this game you'll find some stunning images of the universe but the gameplay is only average at best. This game really suffers from long loading times and at times you'll have trouble finding what you're supposed to be shooting at. However, shooting down small enemy ships is quite easy and after a while it becomes a litte redundant. The game's plot is alright but I think the makers of the game could've worked a little harder at making the ""feel"" of the game more appealing. I recommend this game only to those who are really into space shooter games like Wing Commander and X-wing. Because this is basically the same game."
5,like a cabbie,My daughter wanted the hat that Hannah Montana had wore on a clip from a website. Hannahs is more of a Cabbie style denim hat. It is hard to find denim cabbies. I choose this one and decided to give it to her early. She loves it She is 13
5,One of the best purchases I've made as of yet,I've watched these two discs multiple times now. i am normally pretty cheap and don't enjoy paying $20 for a dvd when I'm only going to watch it a few times. This DVD shows all the right fights and high lights of others. it shows some full fights as well. Great commentary through out as well. I'd say if you are a boxing fan that this is a must own.
4,RISE AND FALL OF AN ICON,"If you're a boxing fan, and are interested in the rise and fall of one who could perhaps have been ""the greatest of all time,"" then this DVD set is for you. This is a tragedy of Homeric proportion, complete with all of the drama, intrigue, and travails of a Puccini opera."
4,"""I'll eat your children.""","I thought this would be just two DVD's of Mike Tyson's greatest fights. It's actually a documentary type show that was on ESPN and there are interviews with Teddy Atlas and some other guy. They all sit around and talk about the fights. The dialog is pretty basic and boring, and so are most of the fights. It is still fun to see Mike Tyson dominate pretty much everyone he ever faced. All in all, if you really like Mike Tyson and documentary type sports shows, then I would recommend it."
5,Come and Get Ya Some,"Mike Tyson may not be the most loved man in sports history, and the video offers opposing views to Mike's greatness, but I'm a Tyson Fanatic. I think Tyson is among the greats.They say that behind every good man is a great woman. The same also goes for sports stars. I always did better when my coach was next to the mats.In any case, I love watching these dvd's. If I'm having trouble getting pumped to spar or workout even, I'll throw in one of these dvd's and wait for my blood to get pumping."
5,A Great Story,"You must buy this it is a great story of a great and powerful fighter, who fell through the cracks."
5,Iron Mike Tyson!,"Awesome!! All killer & no filler, The best of Mike Tyson! Just in case you forgot why Mike Tyson is the 2nd greatest boxer of all time(We all know who the greatest is!) This DVD set will remind you! This is something that you'll definitely watch over and over again. Can't compliment this collection enough, Just get it, Especially if you're a boxing fan, This should be in every fan's collection."
2,missing some essentials,its missing his most memorable fight (with Hollyfield) and where he ended up. He was a true power house that ended in disgrace.
4,A great compilation,"I'm a collector of classic sporting events, so this DVD set to me is a no-brainer... 20 bucks for many of Tyson's fights through the Buster Douglas match. I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because they talk over the first round of the Douglas fight. If I didn't own a recording of that fight already, I'd be pretty pissed about that one thing.Here's the list of fights on the set:Mike Tyson vs. Ricky SpainMike Tyson vs. John AldersonMike Tyson vs. Michael JohnsonMike Tyson vs. Donnie LongMike Tyson vs. Robert ColayMike Tyson vs. Sterling BenjaminMike Tyson vs. RichardsonMike Tyson vs. Sammy ScaffMike Tyson vs. Mike YoungMike Tyson vs. Mike JamesonMike Tyson vs. Jesse FergusonMike Tyson vs. Steve ZouskiMike Tyson vs. James TillisMike Tyson vs. Trevor BerbickMike Tyson vs. Larry HolmesMike Tyson vs. Michael SpinksMike Tyson vs. Frank BrunoMike Tyson vs. James ""Buster"" Douglas"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"It's been a long time since I've purchased a Lawn Spreader, but my old Ortho has finally rusted apart.Bought the Scotts at Lowes yesterday... what a Piece of Crap! Loaded it with 40lbs of Pellitized Lime and I thought it was going to come apart! Wobbling all over, and would barely disperse the Lime, even with it adjusted all the way open. The Hollow, one-sided plastic-molded wheels should have been a dead give-away to me! Taking it back today !!!"
5,customer service is excellent,"I bought my spreader about 7 yrs ago and the handle dry-rotted from the AZ heat. I called customer service @ 888-270-3714 this Saturday morning and a very pleasant woman picked up immediately. I asked if I could purchase a replacement handle and she said she would send one out immediately, for free, no shipping charges, no questions asked. Didn't even ask how long ago I purchased it. Who else does that anymore??? Even though I have been a pretty faithful customer with Scotts, I am now a 100% loyal Scotts customer!"
1,Spreader settings,You can not find spreader settings on the web or by phone. Seems like Scotts wants to make it hard to use a non Scotts product in all of their spreaders. Other than that it works O.K.
1,Poor Quality,This spreader does not work well with regular granular fertilizer. The bottom opening is plastic and jams frequently. It did not last two seasons (small yard) before the plastic opener handle broke. It's in the dumpster now.
2,The old model was much better,"Don't trust the drop rate setting on this spreader. It seems to work predictably with only with Scotts products that have finer grains...but generally cost much more. Non-Scotts fertilizers having larger granules or beads don't pass through the bottom freely. As a check, I set the drop rate per the setting on fertilizer pkg; a popular brand; and also weighed out the amount needed for my back yard at the recommended lbs per 1000 sq ft. It took SIX passes to distribute the measured material over the yard. For the front yard, I opened the setting all the way, and it still took multiple passes to distribute the proper amount for the footage. I guess I'm stuck with it; broadcast spreaders are too spotty and the 3000 seems to be the only push-type spreader still available."
1,Don't Bother!,The release handle on this spreader is a piece of junk. I used this thing three times and the release handle broke off. Genuine Junk.
5,Unlike ATLiens and Aquemeni ...This is almost as 1st album.,Southernaplyalasticcadillacmuzik will always be in the top 25 hiphop albums of all time. This album almost reaches that height.Buy it.MOSS POINT.
4,"Great album, but could have been greater.","This album is a great album, very eclectic. They really stretched the bounds of creativity with song like Ms Jackson and So Fresh, So Clean. I like this album because they kept everything fresh and original. But the only drawback was the cut ""Stankonia."" It leads to the imagination, but not too many long-time Outkast fans would not get into that cut. But don't stop yourself from buying this album because of one bad cut."
5,One of the best hip-hop albums of the year!,"If you pick up Stankonia expecting the standard hip-hop that you would hear elsewhere on the pop charts, you're going to be shocked!Stankonia contains some of the funkiest, most musically fulfilling hip-hop available on the market today. Whether it be straight hip-hop (Gasoline Dreams), straight Parliament-like funk (Stankonia), Prince-sounding songs with lyrical conscience (Toilet Tisha) or drum-and-bass (B.O.B.), this album has it all! And Outkast does it fantastically!That's not to say there aren't some weak songs on this album - there are. I really don't see the point in Snappin' and Trappin', but these weak points are few and far between.If you're a true funk or hip-hop fan, you MUST pick up this album!"
1,"Oh man, what the hell is it?","Nah, nice try fellas. Outkast has been great, but this album was soft. Dre and Big Boi completely sold out to a mainstream, corny, funk that is overplayed on MTV. Are these guys the same one's responsible for ATLiens, or Southernplayalistic... man I can't believe it. Look don't be fooled. If you're a silly frat boy who likes JAY-Z then buy this, but if you actually like listening to genuine Oukast, forget this and pick up some real hip hip."
1,just horrible,"Believe me, I would love to give this album no stars but the minimum is 1. This lp is just terrible. Why would the Kast put out some garbage like that. The cd contains about 3 cuts that are supertight. They say this is future hip hop. If this is future hip hop, then I am gonna listen to a lot of old Big L, Canibus, and Gangstarr cds in the future."
1,They got rich and quit trying,"This can't be Outkast. It just can't be. Thats what I kept tellin myself as I skipped thru the album. I was a HUGE fan of their first 3 albums. But there was NO way for me to know that this one would be wack. They were wrong. Releasing {So fresh so clean} & {Miss Jackson} as singles. That was misleading in everyway. Those singles were OK to me when I heard em on the radio. But compared to the other tracks on the album those 2 might as well be gold. ...Beware, this album is Str8,100% pure, concentrated GARBAGE. It almost hurts to say that bout em. But when I remember how they hurt me {and many others} with this trash I ....They were HUGE around the time this album was made. It shows. They just went into the studio and said things into the mic. They musta made those WACK beats themselves {while high} SURELY they didn't pay someone to do that."
1,STRAIGHT SELL OUT GARBAGE,What the heck happened to these guys..This album is the end of OUTKAST..They are on some futuristic garbage..Noone in the streets care about the future and these corny lyrics and sell out songs..1st 3 albums were classic but now they are a JOKE..They sell music for gay guys and little girls..Only song thats good is BOB..everything else I would never listen to..DONT BUY THIS ALBUM UNLESS YOU LIKE SELL OUT HIP HOP..WHERES THE sKILLS aT???? what happened???
3,Not their best,"I don't know why this album gets so much praise. There are some great tracks, but there are a lot of skip overs too. Compare that to Aquemini, ATLiens, and Southernplayalistic where just about every song is legit, and this one doesn't even come close in my opinion. Too many tracks are overdone with psychotic and annoying beats and sound effects, and not enough of the flow of Dre and Big Boi that makes these guys two of the greatest of all time. If you only have one Outkast album to buy, make sure it's not this one."
3,good album WAY TOO MANY SKITS,this is an interesting approach because it was different from anything oukast had ever done before. Most of the songs are great I would say 11 0f the 16 songs are sweet the other 5 songs are just okay nothin to get excited about but nothing terrible and really the intensity of the good songs make up for the ones that are just okay. Their are 23 tracks total 7 skits and an intro. The main thing that I do not like about this release is the fact that their are to many skits and while some of them are entertaining the first couple times through I find myself skipping through the skits to get to the music. this certainly isnt the greatest Hiphop album of all time or anything like that but All in all I think that this is a solid release from a legendary group I but they have done better. 3 mics
4,Im sorry Ms. Jackson....Ooooooo,"This is Outkasts only album on the rolling Stone 500 ( I think it is # 359) . Outkast have alrady established themselves as the poets of the Rap genre. This one cleverly adds techno beats with guitar and hiss. Not for everyone , but has a stankadelic flava that will knock up yo mama and have her groanin for Stanklove ,,,the best song on tha album. ATL should be proud of Outkast . This CD is a winner."
3,Not the best Outkast,"In the pass, when you listen to Outkast, you tend to zone out and play the CD over and over because the grooves are gooving. Well, this is not the case with this latest CD from the dirty south. It lacks all the things that made the first albums so great - energy. Everything is either overdone or not well done. It is still worh owning if you are a diehard fan."
5,THE BEST IN HIP HOP TODAY!,"Outkast can rest assure their place in music history is now secure. They are creative, experimental, political, spiritual and humorous. They can easily stand alongside Public Enemy, De La Soul and NWA as one of the greatest groups in rap history. If you really listen to Outkast's music and all four of their albums you began to appreciate them as musicians and artist and not just rappers. ""Stankonia"" is yet another crowning achievement for the best group in hip hop.....ah F' it, in music period."
4,Deja Vu,"as i listened to this cd for the 1st time, i immediately started to think about all the parliament/funkadelic albums i used to listen to in the 70s. this music cannot be categorized as 'rap' or hip-hop because of some of the incredible inventiveness on display for your listening pleasure.you will be treated to clever rhymes, beats, and hooks, and some of the strangest electronic music since the aforementioned parliament. my favorites include 'So Fresh, So Clean' and the very funny 'I'll Call Before I Come', which feature all of the above.since i had previously dismissed outkast as just another southern rap group, i would have missed out on this gem by not being open-minded. if you like creative music, it doesnt get any better than this."
5,ATLIENS just doing it,"Outkast is simply great. With every CD they become more versatile. It's like with every album they try not to outdo other artists, but they'd rather outdo themselves. Every album seems to be better and better. I hope Outkast stay in the game for a long time to come because i see Outkast evolving into the greatest rap band ever. Atlanta is the place for rap, r&b, soul, rock, hip-hop, and acid jazz. Outkast is an example of the talent that will be seen coming out of atlanta in the year 2000 and beyond.."
2,A Different Listen,"I can't understand why I have yet to throw this record out the window. Should I break it down to dust? I want to. I really do. I could point out the lack of lyrics (that actually say something). This album is not revolutionary by any means. Hip-hop has seen brigher efforts.Maybe I should have expected songs like ""WE LOVE DEEZ HOEZ"" when Andre 3000 put out the thought in ""HUMBLE MUMBLE"", ""She thought Hip-hop was only guns and alcohol / I said 'Oh hell naw!' but yet it's that too / You can't discriminate because you done read a book or two"". A subtle disclaimer or a noteworthy claim?Stankonia definitely has personality. Unfortunately, it sounds like a junkie on helium. If this is the future of Hip-hop, then I would rather take a few steps back to recooperate.Stellar track: HUMBLE MUMBLE (5 stars) lyrically and musicallyInstrumental highlights: GASOLINE DREAMS, SPAGHETTI JUNCTION, RED VELVETRadio Efforts: MS. JACKSON, SO FRESH SO CLEAN, B.O.B"
2,Stankonia Stinks,"I'm sorry, but I just don't see the appeal in this one... Atliens and Aquemini are two of my favorite hiphop albums of all time, too - but this one falls WAY short of either one. When I heard ""Bombs Over Baghdad"" and ""Ms Jackson"", I was excited about this album because it seemed to me that Outkast was going to continue to break new ground with their music; however, I think they may have done a little too much experimenting - the album is loosely knit and moves along about as quickly as molasses uphill. Definitely not a hiphop must-have."
2,Why are these guys so revered?,"This album and this group deserve so little of the praise they get that it's not even funny. When did rapping become simply saying words that rhyme in quick repetitive spurts that have no rhytmic flow whatsoever and are completely off-tempo with the song's beat!? I give this album 2 stars for their funked-up down-and-dirty beats and a few catchy hooks (like 'Ms. Jackson'). Other than that, these ATLiens need to get some serious schooling on what it is to be an MC."
5,so fresh but not so clean clean,this cd is so awsome but i recommend you dont let younger kids listen to it im 14 and i am bearily old enough to listin to it but buy it i love the cd it is awsome
5,A Hip Hop Classic,"Put simply: if you don't have it, get it now. Every track is entertaining and worth listening to more than once. I'm pretty sure I don't need to go into detail because this album is about 3 years old and those who want it most likely have it. As for those who don't have it. Go get it. End of story."
4,TIGHT!!!!,OUTKAST IS AWSOME. U CAN TOTALLY TELL WHAT THE CUSS WORDS ARE. IN ONE SONG THE COMPANY FOGOT TO BLANK OUT SOME CUSS WORDS. MY MOM MADE ME GET IT EDITED SO I DONT CARE. WAY TO MANY INTERLUDES BUT OTHER THAN THAT ITS TOTALLY TITE.
3,Interesting Listening,"I purchased this album based upon my three song minimum album purchase rule. It however did not meet up to all the hype that has surrounded it. The album is definitely not a bad album but it wasn't (at least for me) earth-shattering or ground-breaking. I have heard other albums by this group, but this is my first purchase. I think this will take a while to grow on me.The standout track is B.O.B (I loved it from the word go). So Fresh, So Clean is brilliant as well as Ms. Jackson (a masterpiece). Erykah does some fine work with them on this as well. The fillers on this CD are hilarious."
4,rappas delight,"i think this cd is the bomb and reccomend it to everybody. its not hard core rap like you might expect from two guys that can rap that fast, but it talks about life and the videos are nice because they use labs and little cats and bright colors in stead of dark gloomy colors and rotweilers and dovermans.(bright colors in b.o.b. and cats and nice dogs in ms. jackson)"
5,W.O.W,"This C.D. is great. Its got such a different sound and the rap isn't all ""west side"" like. I highly recommend buying it. Two great songs on it are Ms. Jackson and B.O.B."
4,Kast did it again!,"The very first time I heard this Cd, I loved it but noticed imediately that they had held true to their formula of giving you something new and pushing the envelope of hip hop as art. They always bring it to you tight and if you liked any of their previous albums I highly recommend purchasing this one. They are the only consistent group from the Dirty South, they always bring it and they haven't stopped with this one!"
4,"Amazing, Innovative, but some spots lacked ""IT""","Stankonia is a PHAT Album, I think ATLiens is their best CD but Stankonia does not disappoint. The beats that back up perhaps the two wranchiest rap voices in the business are unreal. You get a nice dirty south bass on a few tracks and a rap beat with a little techno beat jammed underneath it (B.O.B) The little skits are hillarious in between songs, but there are too many of them. Track 6 is a 4 minute waste of time and noise, but other than that it is a solid rap album, if you are thinking ""Gee, I don't know, DO IT, I PROMISE YOU"" If you are buying a gift for any hip-hop fan they will dig this funky ass album. Like Big Boi and Andre3000 say ""They are the coolest (people) on the planet."""
3,ok album,this was a ok outkast album its not the best the best song on the album is bombs over baghdad because the singer raps HELLA FAST!!!STANKONIAthe best outkast album is ATLenis
3,How Expicit?,"I have a 10 year old son who is eager to make a purchase of thelatest cd by Outkast. As a quasi responsible parent, I am hoping to get some response as to the appropriateness of the language for a 10 year old. I realize this is not a review but hope to receive some responses."
4,"Oh baby, tight!","Ever since I got this as a ""gift"" from my ""girlfriend"" we've been doing ""fun stuff,"" if you know what I mean. LIke, Outkast says, ""bombs over bagdahd"" *nudge nudge*. I love to ""get my septic tank serviced,"" wink wink. I always have her use the 9-inch hose, if you catch my drift.This album is great, every hhiphop fan should own it. Tight lyrics, nice beats, smooth flow, nice coverart, whats not to love."
2,"If you need something done, do it yourself","Considering the remarkably low caliber of rhyming that passes for the rap top 40 nowadays, it is a remarkable feat that OutKast have secured a footing in the mainstream, and they are always a welcome respite on rap radio when I dare to listen. Nonetheless, this album, my one and only foray into OutKast's recorded work, failed to grow on me as I assumed it would. Despite some scathing tracks like ""Gasoline Dreams"" and ""Red Velvet,"" OutKast is compelled to weigh down some unorthodox beats and rhymes with a depressingly large cadre of orthodox, bland (and often ignorant) guest rappers. One assumes that some of them are old friends or cousins that Andre and Big Boi felt indebted to, but for me, they make the album more of a chore than an enjoyable experience. Hopefully next time out, they limit guest rappers to the three most skilled, but I'm unlikely to risk another release by OutKast after this one."
3,don't believe the hype,"the worst of their albums. of course, their worst is better than most artists best. stupid skits."
5,Dirty Dirty South,"Stankonia is a perfect example of thriving and new age southern hip hop. While the cd may cover generic categories as women and having sex, it also explores more political as well social themes.It ranges from up tempo songs with lyrics flying at you with blazing speed to slower songs with catchy beats and memorable lyrics. Although I am just newly getting into Outkast as well as the whole hip hop scene, I strongly recommend this album to anyone who hasn't heard it before. This is Outkast at their best."
3,No as good as their older albums,This CD is tight. But I gave it 3 stars because I think Outkast can do better than this. This album doesn't compare to Aquemini.
3,If I could give it 3+1/2 stars I would,"This is for all those hip-hop heads who have only heard the first single, B.O.B. Don't be discouraged if you don't like that track. Outkast shows that they still can rip it up, check tracks like Ms. Jackson, So Fresh So Clean, and We love deez hoes, if your looking for that old Outkast style that we all love. Personaly I don't like B.O.B. but I still like this CD. Overall I'd say it's better than ""Aquemini"" but lacks the 4 stars of ""southernplayalisticadillacmuzik"" and the 5 stars that ""ATLiens"" deserves."
3,Still dope but the worst Outkast Album,"if you have listened to the first Three Outkast albums you realize how tight this group is. this album lacks the overall listen all the way through ""MC conditioner"" style that the first three albums had. The only reason I give it a three is the it is the fourth best album out of the four released. If you peeped tracks like Ms. Jackson and call before I come and haven't checked for the earlier albums; start on albums one and two and peep this last...Two is the best one, one and three are still two of the best albums of thier respective years. Peep them all but start with the earlier cds."
3,Pretty good but a little bit too experimental,"I think this cd is overall pretty good, but some of the songs are just too strange and there's way too many of those on this cd. however, some songs do kind of make up for this such as we love deez hoes, gasoline dreams, xplosion, and bob. they have a good style, they just need to kinda tone it down. the strangest songs on this cd are stankonia and toilet tisha. if these songs weren't on the cd and some of the skits were omitted, i would probably give it a higher rating. i would recommend that you look at this recording, but you should definately listen to it first to see what you think of it because it's really different from anything you will hear in a while."
2,beleive me,"what up again believe ME people this album is the worst album i've heard this album is only good because of so fresh and so clean,miss jackson and B.O.B. thats it DON'T buy this its a waist believe me i have about 100 rap cds from 2pac to LL Cool J and my worst is this CD ....."
5,Stankin Up,"I just bought the new outkast CD and popped it in my CD player not knowing what to expect. What I found was a pretty stanky CD that you should buy even if you dont like rap. Not only are the beats good, but they are unlike any others at this point in time. That is the main reason why I like this CD and the main reason you should buy it too. My favorite songs are Ms. Jackson, and I really like the song ""?"" cause it has the stankiest beats. Anyways when you play this CD it will end up stankin up your house."
4,One of the Best!,This album has a lot of good songs. One of their best albums ever. I would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of their music or just a fan of Hip-hop in general.
1,Stank stinks,I'm a fan of Hip Hop but not a fan of OutKast. The beats are terrible and the leyrix don't make sense. Mybe because I don't like this type of Hip Hop.
2,stankonia really stinks,I think this outkast album should have never been released.It is totally different than their previously releases. They should have stopped with aquemini if this is the direction they are now going to take.Buy there other three albums and forget this one.
1,Worst album in history of music,this album is stupid with no point no good songs. Its just about 2 men going on about nothing the songs are boring if i was you id buy eminem's album there is no point in buying this album its the worst album i have ever heard im very dissapointed i this album very poor i wouldnt even waste 5 cents on this album
3,Drop in Quality,"This Cd is a big drop form Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, Aquemini, and ATLiens. Those 3 cds were classics, and no one can take that away. But Stankonia does not even compare with these three cds. Outkast has gone from one of the best rap groups to just another radio filler. I miss the Outkast of old. Where have they gone?"
3,Nice cd,"This is a quite good cd. It has nice tunes and chorus, which makes this cd special. This detail allow people not close to rap music to enjoy it as much as a person who uses to listen rap music. But i don't think this is the best rap cd ever at all, even it's not outkast at their best. Their flow on this cd sounds a little bit stuck, and their lyrics look to be designed so everyone can enjoy their songs. It is evident that they were thinking in selling cds.So if you don't like rap music this cd will help you to introduce into this musical style. But if you want something different try Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, it was the first cd outkast developed (I am not sure of this), get it because it really woth."
4,"stankonia, the stankiest album so far","i havent been a fan of outkast for very long, i had heard their hit songs on the radio and on mtv, but i never heard their albums until a friend let me borrow his atliens cd, i thoroughly enjoyed it..so, i made a copy for myself..i also got a hold of their albums, aquemini and southernplayalisticadillacmuzik..what a name..haha, and i heard the first single for stankonia, ""b.o.b"" which i fell in love w/..then i bought the album, and it's great! i love songs 1-24, it's well made, groovy southern rap at it's best..i would love to see them perform live sometime in the near future..i would recommend this album to any outkast fan, and just plain rap fans..it's worth every penny."
5,Stankonia its on ya,"I dont think these guys can make bad music, After three of the best albums in rap (Southerplayalistic, ATLiens, Aquemeni) they drop Stankonia, which is another 5 mic, best rap albums of all times, with tracks like So Fresh and Clean, Humble Mumble, and the breathtakin B.O.B. Outkast places themselves firmly in the hip hop hall of fame. Only real hip hop goin on here, no bad messages, no gratuitous violence and womanizing like every other song we hear today. Only Fresh beats, and stanky lyrics, Outkast is in a world of thier own, and everyone should buy this album"
4,these Brothers are tight,i respect the chances that Outkast take.i feel a strong Prince&P-Funk Vibe going on.however i do like there first two albums a bit more overall.but B.O.B&Ms.Jackson are tight.i respect artists that don't go for the same old same.it's refreshing hearing somebody trying something different.there music is always tight.
4,"After a few listens, you'll like it.","When I first heard this album, I thought Outkast had made a big mistake by venturing out and experimenting with different sounds. But, with each listen, I began to like more and more of the songs. There are still some tracks that I think should have been left off, but overall, this is a good effort by them. It is definitely an album that stands out from the rest of the albums at this day and time. My favorites are: Ms. Jackson, Call Before I Come, Spaghetti Junction, Humble Mumble, Red Velvet and Slum Beautiful. I could not give this album a perfect 5 because I do not like all of the songs and that is a step down from their last album for that reason. All of their previous albums were very consistent. But, nonetheless, this album is different in a good way and I recommend it to those who are looking to explore the latest innovations in hip hop."
4,Not As Good As I Expected,"This CD was tight, but can't compare to ""ATLiens"" or ""Aquemeni"". I think Outkast could have come with something better, but the CD is still good. If you're a true Outkast fan, it is a good buy, but if you're not, don't be so quick to buy it."
5,Stankonia,"This was the best outkast so far.i think it always may be. certain tracks on this i love so much, i can hear them again, and again (ms. jackson, So fresh so clean, ect.. So fresh so clean had a funky beat. you just can't help but to dance to it. heheh.well, outkast did it again. great job big boi & Andre !"
3,Some good music but too much woman hating,I've always liked Outkast.And I dig this album. But there is too much woman hating (there shouldn't be any but this is an ignorant world). And some of the guest appearances are sub par.Thus I have to be honest and give one of my favorite rap groups 3 stars.
4,Not the oukast i'm used to,"Although it is a pretty tight cd, i was pretty dissapointed with this cd. I have enjoyed outkast since noone heard of em during the southernplayalistic days. now I feel they are going mainstream. I don't want that to happen cause all of their other albums were complete classics in my book. I mean, the album isn't bad but it's just not one of the cd's of outkast that I really love."
3,"Eh, over-rated...","Don't get me wrong, Stankonia certainly reflects it's culture, but it seems like this album was made for dummies. Instead of the fine beats and glorious rhymes, Stankonia gyps you most of the time with awful tapping rhythms and short and impure flows. On occasion, you will get a track worthy of listening to (""Gasoline Dreams"", ""B.O.B."" to name a few), and when those do show up they are beautiful, but there are not enough of them. Don't buy this album before you buy their three previous and way better albums."
5,best c.d. I've ever heard!!!!,"This album is one of the best hip-hop albums ever. I first gotthis back in 2000 when it first came out. I was only 12 years old. I have to admit, when I first got it, I didn't like it because I didn't appreciate real music when I heard it, and growing up in the hood, I was used to listening to crunk, club music. But as I listened to it, I fell in love with it. I'm 16 now, and OutKast are my favorite rappers . This album is one of the few rap albums with real meaning to it. If I had to represent hip-hop with one c.d., this would be it. Bottom line, if you are thinking about getting this c.d., take it from me, you won't be sorry."
2,doesn't work as well as hoped,"you need a LOT of light for the camera to shoot the picture. we even had problems inside the house. it's a disapointing christmas gift and i would not recommend it at all. i didn't give it a 1 because if all the conditions are perfect, the pictures are pretty good and not very difficult to load onto the computer for viewing."
1,Camera of disappointment,"I bought this camera for my daughter to take on a trip to Mexico (she wanted an underwater camera for snorkeling). The batteries were consumed by the camera so quickly (even if we shut the camera off) that she didn't even bring home any pictures. If the battery runs out, all pictures are lost. After three attempts with three sets of batteries, we gave up. Big disappointment."
3,Cheap but not necessarily nasty,"C'mon, it's a cheap camera (more like a battery operated usb stick with a lens). Cut it some slack. We bought one ages ago and forgot we had it. Just prior to a recent holiday in Vanuatu I pulled it out and threw it into the bag with some batteries, just in case, not expecting much. Used it there, no problem, watertight, brought it home, plugged it into my Mac - nothing. Not even recognition that something was in the usb port. So I loaded up the provided software onto my aged and wheezing PC desktop, connected the camera and lo! There were all the pictures! Sure, they weren't flash but they were there. But then I noticed the 'enhance' function on the loaded software. Brilliant! My slightly washed out pics were suddenly vibrant and full of the colour that the real underwater world had had. So, camera, probably a 2. Software, definitely a 3. Put them together and the whole deal has to be worth 3 stars."
1,False Advertising Tigerdirect,"The Tigerdirect site claims this is a 3 megapixiel camera. That is false, it is 0.3 mp. Picture quality is a joke, camera phone probably better. There is no way this camera would take a shot underwater on it's own without help from lights. Save your money on this thing."
3,Digital Concepts Aqua Shot VGA Under Water Digital Camera,"A cute inexpensive way to take underwater pictures. They came out ok, not very high resolution. Great for kids.Buy the lithium batteries and you are set. Worth it for the price."
1,underwater camera,We were not able to download to the computer. Computer gave message that camera could not be seen.
3,Good but nothing new,"Well I have several books on gaited horses, such as Gaits of Gold and I have David Lichman's video on training for gait. If you have no other books or reference material it is a good book, but if you have a few already it does not cover anything new. It is a good buy for the price, though, as the other gaited books and video I have were more expensive."
5,only the best!,"As a newbie to gaited horses, this book is a wealth of information on everything gaited as well as lots of info on horses. I would recommend this book to anyyone who wants to know about gaited horses. Thanks Lee for the defacto standard book on gaited horses. I will always treasure this book and use it often!"
2,Okay book,I found this book a little hard to read. Maybe need to be more on a level with novices like myself.
5,"Lee Ziegler, gift to the gaited horse world!","I was fortunate to have Lee counsel me w/my horses prior to her death. She was an incredible horsewoman and educator, committed to only healthy, gimmick-free, harmless methods of training and horsekeeping. That she completed this incredibly thorough collection of her knowledge and teachings just prior to her death is a blessing to the gaited horse world.It's a wonderful gift for any gaited horse owner."
3,SO-SO,The book is worth getting for the first half alone - the last half of the book did not teach me much that wasn't what I considered common knowledge.
3,Gittee up,2 dimensional pictures and descriptions just can't cover the subject. Need a visual with it.
2,starts off well,"The author does a good job at defining the gaits and tack, but the training sections are repetitive and boring. They are also very simplified, which is good for someone who knows nothing about horses, but such a person should probably not train a gaited horse without in-person experienced help. I got half way through the book and finally couldn't read anymore. I attended one of Lee's gaited workshops in CA a couple years ago. Women seem to appreciate her approach. I just didn't agree with everything so didn't go back for the second day but spent time with my horse instead. I bought the book to see if perhaps there was something valuable that I might've missed. My time was better spent with my horse."
4,wrong album,"This album is listed wrong, and the other reviewers don't know what they're talking about. The album pictured is Moments of Madness by a one-off group called Local Boys:Andy Fairweather Low (Guitar, Vocals)Jerry Donahue (Guitar)Pat Donaldson (Bass)Glyn Johns (Producer, Engineer)Tim Gorman (Keyboards)David Kemper (Drums)Nothing to do with Barry Reynolds."
5,Great book!,This book helped me improve my score by over 250 points. Friends who used other SAT prep books kept borrowing mine - I definitely recommend it.
1,WATCH THE PRICE!,$70 to ship a few pounds-worth of metal? I don't think so. Go to your local mall and shop from a store that starts with an S and ends in EARS...Purchase canceled.
4,Does what I expected.,"I bought these dollies to allow me to push my incapacitated 911 around in my garage, and they do the job as expected. They are solidly built and roll easily. My only quibble, and it's minor, is that they ship unassembled i.e. you have to bolt the casters onto the trays yourself, and that took a little time."
3,Great rustic music - but not the best version,"Ryba's christmas music is not really a mass in any sense - the different sections of a pastorale about a servant waking his master to go to Bethlehem may be named after sections of the Latin mass but the similarity(!) stops there. This unfortunately is not the best version. In 1998 the Czech branch of DG-Archiv recorded a more glossy version with Robert Hugo (and Magdalena Kozena singing three Ryba pastoral-songs in addition). It costs a little more, but includes the Czech texts and translations which are essential to enjoyment, which (unusually for Naxos) this release doesn't. The shorter 'Missa Pastoralis' coupling here is about the same length as the 3 songs on the Kozena disc.There is also a version on Supraphon - but I haven't heard it and don't know if it includes texts or not."
5,"Durable, adjustable, simple","We wanted a futon that could be put in a near-upright position, rather than the usual lazy-lounging angle. This frame has plenty of options for adjustment, and our spring mattress doesn't slide off when it's upright. The wood frame is also far more forgiving than the usual metal."
5,"Easy to assemble! Strong, sturdy, and well made!",This futon frame far exceeded my expectations! I was by myself when I put it together and everything fit so well together. I would say it took me less than an hour to have it set up. This wood frame is wonderful and is strong and sturdy with excellent craftsmanship. Some advice for your potential purchasers is to have a power screwdriver on hand... It'll make the process go so much faster! I highly recommended this frame to anyone because it's so inexpensive yet high quality. It's great for a guestroom or even a college student's room.
2,Study and looks nice but hard to put together and parts do not fit,"Overall is a nice frame. It took me an hour and a half to put together, after breaking my hand-screw driver I had to buy a power tool to get the screws in, they are not pre-drilled. After I put it together the part that comes down into the curve when setting the frame upright was not long enough and did not fit in all the way. I sat down on it to see if more weight would press it down so it would fit. BIG mistake, the back fell forward onto me and smashed and my hand badly in between the desk. Will call the company to see about replacing the back part that is too short."
2,Buyer Beware! You Get What You Pay For!,"It doesn't look as nice as the picture. The wood is butt ugly. It's got knots, it's green and it doesn't turn a nice light brown when you put it in the sun as the manufacturer claims. Thank goodness the mattress covers the frame almost entirely because you wouldn't want it to show. The front legs show and it is just two pieces of wood stapled together. Yuk. I even used Watco oil on it, hoping it would improve the look of the wood. Don't bother. It's okay for a dorm or a basement if you have a spare futon mattress and no frame. In our case, they broke our beautiful maple frame when we moved and we thought this would look good. Wrong! But the seller can't be beat. It came damaged and they were quick to get us the replacements."
5,Great frame!,"I am so glad we decided to get this frame for our futon when the metal one we had started to sag and break underneath. We received it superfast which was awesome because we were just sitting on the floor with the futon mattress! It was easy to put together, my husband and I assembled it in probably about an hour. We opted to stain it first because although the naked wood itself was nice our other things are a darker color wood so it would have looked weird being as light as it was. It turned out really nice with the stain. It is very sturdy and I believe it will last us for many years to come, much longer than the flimsy metal one we had before. I am very happy with this purchase!"
4,Definitely a great and sturdy futon frame,I am very happy with this frame for the mattress I ordered. When you sit on the futon it is very comfortable and also to sleep on. The one thing that I found somewhat negative is that I found it a little hard to put together. I read the reviews before I bought it and I did purchase it based on how easy people said to put together but I found the directions a little confusing but I would still highly recommend this frame it was worth the money
4,solid futon frame,"I looked around a local stores for a good futon frame for a guest room. What I found were either flimsy metal frames or overpriced wooden frames with arms that made it too large for the space where I wanted to put it. This frame is the perfect size, solidly built and good looking, and for a great price. I was a little worried when I saw how many pieces there were, but with a friend's help, we had it put together in about 45 min. The only tools we needed was a power screwdriver and a hammer. I will say that with the mattress on, it is easier to close with 2 people."
5,great music,i cant say enough good things about the cd. it was everything i expected and more. the only thing better than listening to the duhks is reading an Anne Rice book.
2,Talented group but nothing special,Im not a big fan of the Duhks or the HOT Nickelcreek sound for that matter. Stick with the classics and if your itchnig for somehting new check out anything with David Grisman!I would consider myself an open minded listener and have seen the Duhks two times and they are very talented but they didnt knock my socks off or anythng!
2,Not Nickel Creek,"I picked up this CD on the promise that the Duhks were expanding upon the nitch carved out by Nickel Creek. That definitely created higher expectations than maybe are fair. However, I have an open mind to music and was curious enough to give the disk a thorough listen not once, but three times. Unfortunately, nothing grew on me. The lyrics are often repetitive and if not childish, then trite. The instrumentation is capable, but certainly not outstanding for the genre. They are an OK band, but certainly not worth the bucks in my opinion. In the area I'm from (Charleston, WV) I can hear bands at least this good, or better, at any local coffee shop or bar on any weekend.If you're looking for excellent music in this style, you're better off sticking with Nickel Creek or it's members solo projects. The Duhks aren't fit to wade in their waters."
3,misleading,The music on the CD is great but it's advertised falsely. This is NOT a 2 disc collection but rather a single disc. It seems there are two versions of this disc floating around. So Beware. I was greatly disappointed as I even checked out the details on the site very carefully. It was advertised as a two disc collection.
5,I love this book!,"The Old Testament: Ten Plays for Readers Theater, is a wonderful book! This book would be wonderful for a Sunday School class, a Christian school, or just to enjoy at home. I really enjoyed reading this book. It really makes the story sink in; the Bible is hard to understand, this book is more towards our level. This book provides a highly enjoyable way to learn the storys of the bible!"
3,Works fine but beware,"Because you're free-handing this from the tool rest, beware that you don't gouge the leather. Carefully face the tool's sharp edge AWAY FROM the direction of spin. First time I used it, I slowly lowered the cutting edge perpendicular to the spinning platter (parallel to the rest) and in the blink of an eye I cut a gouge about an inch in from the center. Chalk it up to inexperience and not thinking this through.Just lucky it didn't rip the plane iron from my hands and fling it across the workshop, nor did it damage the glass plate under the leather.I think I'll buy the micromesh disks and retire the leather hone."
3,Good for final honing---but can't use sharpening port,"This leather wheel is good for putting the final edge and polish on your tool. It includes a little packet of petroleum jelly that you smear on the wheel the first time you use it, as well as the green compound that you charge the leather disc with.Note that you can only use this wheel *facing up*---it's not meant to face down, so you can't use the sharpening port. If you have the wide tool accessory that fits on the top, then you will be able to hold your tools that way. Otherwise, if you don't have it (like me), you will have to free-hand it, using the tool rest. This is no problem for back of blades, but for the blade bevel, you have to carefully hold the blade by hand at the correct angle. So far it's worked ok for me, but it would be nice if you could use it with the sharpening port."
2,Informative but difficult to read.,"Although I learned a lot about each first lady, the book was difficult to read. It skipped around way too much and it was difficult to remember all the characters (especially since they are introduced with their maiden names). I think the author needs a much more thorough editor and a second opinion on the arrangement of the content."
2,First Ladies,"I was disappointed that the writing wasn't of the caliber of his other book, Florence Harding."
2,music,this product is ok. There really is only one or two songs on the album that are any good. the rest are kind of hateful or depressing. Would be better sold as a single for the good songs. Doing business with Amazon was really good though. But of course it always is.
5,"Poverty, cigarettes, booze and welfare","Flashes of genius but not always readable. Short stories that sometimes lapse into incoherent surrealistic stream of consciousness. The understandability is often further reduced by phonetic spelling of dialect. The phonetic spelling assumes that the reader normally speaks Southern British English (for example ""game"" spelled ""gemm."") At times it is absolutely brilliant with dark humor describing the way the shiftless (often homeless and destitute) make ends meet by welfare and panhandling. Reminded me often of James Joyce, which is not altogether a compliment because I've never managed to finish Ulysses."
3,"Well Written, but Unexciting","This is about as good a way to get to know Kelman's writings as any, since he's selected the 35 short stories in this volume from four or five of his previous collections. They range from a half-page to thirty pages or so, and tend to be rather unexciting interior monologues. There are a few nice stories, my favorite being ""Remember Young Cecil,"" about a former pool champion. Nothing much to inspire one to seek out his other work, though."
5,A good overview,"Have you ever wondered about the little details of everyday Japanese life? For example, do you wonder what those arrows in people's houses are for, or why those little cat statues have their paws raised? The answers are here. Short and clear explanations on dozens of unique and interesting Japanese customs are explained clearly and in enough detail to surprise even your Japanese friends. This book is excellent for someone who is moving to Japan, or has just recently arrived."
3,interesting but dated,"some very interesting information enlightening to Japanese culture and happenings, but a little dated (published 1996)...some facts I'm sure are no longer relevant (data, statistics), but otherwise still an interesting read."
1,Don't waste your money,"I was considering buying this game for my six year old son, who loves Batman. We decided to rent it first, to make sure he would like it. This turned out to be a wise move. It is VERY difficult to control, even on the easy mode. My son was having such a hard time with it, that I decided to try it myself. I, too, became very frustrated with it. I would not recommend this game for a young child. If you are thinking about this one, do yourself a favor and rent it first."
3,Don't be in a race for Gotham racer,"This was one of my various collections to the Batman video games. This one involved cars and such. There was some fun hunting down the bad guy and capturing him, if you are not a fan of racing video games then this game is not for you. There are some cut scenes to the last Batman the Animated series which are a joy to watch, but does not have a high replay value. Get it for less then retail value so you will not feel cheated."
3,Joe hill bogus,"... I thought this game was pretty good for playstation. Some cool artwork, and a decent job of converting the animated world into 3D. Not alot of polish but still alright."
3,Enter the world of the Batman Animated Series,"This is a fun game - it's a simple arcade racer where you can chase the various villains from the Batman Animated Series, including Scarecrow, Poison Ivy and the Joker. I found it to be an enjoyable game, and the use of cut scenes from the actual show made the game even more enjoyable to me. If you like Batman, and like the art deco look of the show, you will love this game."
5,more sex,"This book I couldn't put down. Ok, I had to. But I kept coming back to it before any of the others. I haven't read the first Morgan book, but you can be sure it is going to the top of my TBR pile. Morgan is contacted by a secret society to assist them with their issues - someone is killing off the men they invite to their events. Their events, by the way, usually involve domination and sex. Morgan struggles with the morality issues as well as the privacy issues once she, and the police, realize that the men that are being killed are connected. There are a lot of twists and turns is this mystery - once again the Cajun character has seduced me - but I thought it was great and I never suspected the ending."
3,An OK book,It was different. I have not read anything quit like it before. I would probably read MJ Rose again sometime.
4,The Delilah is a delight,"I picked up this book from the donation pile at the desk, The original was in such bad shape that I bought a new one. It has prompted me to buy more of her books! If you are interested in a book that you just cannot put down - a who-dunnit with class, humor and chilling realism - READ IT!!"
5,Miyavi's best,"Miyavi sure has evolved since his first album, Gagaku. He seemed a bit too shy on his first album, however, this (Galyuu) being his second album, he can express himself! He doesnt' seem afraid anymore! The songs are more rough and agressive and his voice isn't so quiet and he's actually singing. His songs are harder rockwise and his voice sounds so angry. But the album isn't just rock. He mixes the album with a bunch of elements such as acoustic songs, poppylike songs, and just plain old fun rock! Don't miss out on this release. For old fans and new! If you didn't like Gagaku, try Galyuu."
3,Entertaining but not compelling.,"This was not a book that I had trouble putting down or couldn't wait to get back to. I found it well written. It represented real life in that it related the human failures under the outward appearance of a ""happy family"" However, it was not a satisfying book to the extent that I would search out other books written by the same author."
4,A well written story of about small town people..,"Set in the early 1900's this book entertains with small town American thinking of the time. The story is told through the thoughts of the characters themselves. The story is made all the better for the reader as the ironies in the lives of the characters make their stories ageless. The times may change, but human nature seems the same. It is a guiet story, about a family."
5,great transaction wonderful book,I got this book very quickly and in nice shape. It is a very well-written book . One that many ready over and over since it was written in the'60's
3,"No masterpiece, but pleasant..mostly.","I hate to be negative because overall I did not hate this book, but its no masterpiece as some reviews lead you to believe. The story is about a family in Missouri and disjointed events in their lives from about the turn of the century over the course of 40 years or so. No character is developed to any degree, you don't like or dislike any of them. The events are not spectacular in any way, in fact I found the first 250 pages a bit boring. What I did like is the authors writing style that always reminded of a sunny southern summer, even when horrible things were happening in the story. Overall not a waste of time, pleasant enough, but no masterpiece. It benefits from being relatively short (just over 300 pages), any longer and I would not be giving it 3 stars."
5,Great Story,I have suggested this book to my friends who are avid readers. It was a nice tale of a dysfunctional family!
4,American Snapshot,"This is a beautiful tale of an American family growing up and growing old in early to mid 20th century America. A picture of Americana. Not quite as dramatic as Grapes of Wrath, but just as important. The narrator has a nice voice and weaves a very good literary work through the unique device of telling each person's story through an omniscient narrator, while at the same time making each narrative dependent on the others' stories. Filled with wonderful insight and maturity!"
2,Not a favorite,"I haven't much time, nor ability(ill) to read, so I try to read books that I think I will enjoy. Unfortunately, I over-estimated this read.It was an ""easy"" read in that I certainly didn't get involved with the characters much. I am generally a very ""emotional"" reader, but this book pretty much left me flat."
5,My all time favorite book.,I also first read this book when it was serialized in Ladies Home Journal in the early 60's and have read it many times since. The characters were genuine and the prose was simple and lovely.
4,A very good read....,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, thought it was very well written and the characters were very interesting!Would highly recommend it."
4,Pleasant Read,Great book to just curl up and read on a lazy day. It moves along nicely and makes you feel the moment.
5,very comfortable,"I just finished the The Moonflower Vine and I really enjoyed it. The story is beautifully written and it was nice to settle in to this book, it was a comfortable place to be. It was the kind of book that made me sad to get to the end, just because I enjoyed being in the characters world. I'm very glad to have found this gem."
2,Moonflower Vine Revieww,It was the most dull boring book I have ever read. There was no content to the story. I would not recommend it.
3,Left me wanting answers,Beautifully written but ended with so much unansweredWanted to see the father exposed. Not sure why republished. Not that great
4,Comfortable read,Sometimes lost track of which character viewpoint was the focus. Overall enjoyed this book and would recommend to my book club.
5,Beautiful....,"A book well-written with descriptive or emotional phrases that cause you to stop and re-read the sentence or paragraph just for the pleasure of her wording and phrasing! The story catches you up slowly and weaves you into another era with each family member giving their views of the life they all shared, carefully revealing how their lives fit together. The mysteries that unfold with the beauty and love in their everyday life are exemplified in that once-a-year revealing of the flowers on the Moonflower Vine. A book that makes you want to read more by this author."
4,Good read.,Realistic read about a Midwestern family and the love that kept them going during tough times. Not predictable in the least.
4,Good read,"Very entertaining family saga with interesting characters and excellent writing. Characters are well drawn, their emotions described thoughtfully and beautifully, story interesting"
3,too easy for a 16 year old. =),This game has great graphics and the sounds are great with the recognisable disney aladdin tunes - it makes a difference from the annoying sounds the GBC usually makes.I found this game too easy and completed it the first day I bought it. The game doesn't have many levels. I think this game is great fun for younger gamers... probably 8-12. I don't reccomend this game for long journeys as it is a game you will want to put down.
3,Disney's aladdin,"This game was a lot of fun and very challenging, this is not an easy game to complete. The bad part about this game is you can not save your progress."
5,Having a Pint with Damien.,"'On the Way to Work' is many things.It is a collection of conversations between Burn and Hirst. The conversations range from Hirst's love for Francis Bacon, to grumblings on his dealings with the media.But perhaps most importantly, 'On the Way to Work' is Hirst's manifesto. It is an insight into how he views his own art.This book is a great buy. If you are interested in Hirst, this book is essential.(For those looking for a book that showcases Hirst's art, I would recommend the fantastic: 'I want to spend the rest of my life everywhere...' )"
4,My first,This was the first poker book I ever read. This one book was enough to turn a losing player into a winning player. It has the most complete and thoughtful coverage of 7-stud hi/lo split with no qualifier that I've read.
4,This book will help you win in a medium-skill game,"All the basics are there in this easy to read primer on high-low poker. It teaches you strategies on when to play your hand, how to bet and describes accurately the more popular variations of high-low poker. You'll see games not described here, but they're the fringe. Can't beat the price, either - four anties in our game!"
1,For the Love of Anthony--wrong title,"This book is titled incorrectly. It should be called for the love of Me. It is a pod book that is obviously written about the author, not her son. She writes of personal details that no one wants to know about (and leaves out some I wonder about). She never explains what her son does that is so bad she has to send him away to boot camp. She only says he misbehaves. The two incidents she does mention--lighting candles and pool hopping--are minor problems she views as major. The only time the child acts out physically is when he kicked a motel air conditioner and this was on the way to the boot camp. She needed to go to camp--parenting camp. I can't imagine how hurtful this book is to her son. The book was poorly written and does not live up to the blurb on the cover."
5,My favorite instrumental of all time,"I'm 70-years-old, and have survived a variety of musical fads and tastes, but this instrumental by Acker Bilk is my all-time favorite.Many years ago--in the late 'fifties--on the way to Portland in my car, I heard this song on the radio. It hit me hard. I almost braked, I was so stunned by its beauty. The B-flat clarinet was absolutely soulful. It was as if the tune had been written and performed especially for me and had been written in my soul.Since then, my daughter--now grown and with a couple of grandchildren--when she was in grade school, learned to play the clarinet so that she could play it for me. She knew how I loved it.No other artist does it like Acker Bilk.Probably everyone has heard it by now, but if you have not, may I recommend it to you?"
5,A Beautiful Masterpiece,I absolutely love this album.It is one of the greatest albums you can buy.The song Stranger on the Shore is beautiful.Especialy when it is played on the clarinet.It's a very relaxing album.I would recommend this to anybody.
3,"Alright book, but not the best available","This book is okay for homebrewers but it doesn't cover the basis. Save your money and buy Charlie Papazian's Joy of Homebrewing - it's cheaper, great for beginners and advanced brewers and has tons more information."
3,OK for now,"but we need a re-release of Into the Dragon - I wore my original tape out back in 1989 playing it over and over, fantastic. Unfortunately, I cannot find another copy anywhere in the UK, and have to rely on a promo vinyl copy which, being cut only one side, has only half the album on. Best of will have to do for now, but melting my speaker cones with Megablast will have to wait, again"
1,Dissapointed,"I purchased this album for one track ""Winter in July"" took a chance on the mix being the original version, it isnt, if you want that track you need the original 7"" mix, or something similar.I am not a die hard fan, so this wasnt for me,, but if you are looking for a greatest hits then it would do the job...but like most I wasnt aware that Bomb The Bass had many hits!!"
5,love these,"ordered as replacements for the ones I lost in Key West. These are great, spring hinges, blocks glare, love these shades."
5,Extra spool,Having A extra is great. If I run out of string I can just pop out the empty spool and pop the new one in and keep going. Later I can refill the empty one for the next time.
5,Finding it here saved me from getting a new weed eater,"I purchased this weedeater a few years back from Walmart and while I love the weed eater, Wally world no longer carries it and doesn't supply the replacement spools. None of my local stores carried the spools either. I am really happy that I found these on Amazon as I didn't want to buy a new weedeater - the one I have works great."
1,Awful,"What would you think? the sound of a southern swamp - frogs and critters - lots of different critters and sounds. Right? Imagine the surprise when it turns out to be a thirty second clip repeated for fifty minutes. The same grunt grunt grunt followed by ""splash splash"" followed by grunt splash. Repeat. over and over. It's only ($). Don't spend it."
2,Sound was not good,"Show was not of my taste, not something I enjoyed. Actually was not all that good - It is no wonder it was dropped"
5,Outstanding,"When coupled with a hammer drill like the Bosch 1194AVSRK (whose specifications say it capable of driving a 3/4"" hole in concrete), you can actually use this 1"" bit _without_ a pilot hole. Very, very nice."
1,I had the same problem.,"I had the same exact problem as the other reviewer. I can't believe they still have this product available on their site, with multiple problems reported! I also ordered the bucket, received a cheese slicer, and contacted customer service only to be sent another cheese slicer. I expected better from Amazon! When I contacted customer service again at that point, I was told my order was cancelled, because they were unable to figure out the problem with this item, and yet here it is, still available! I would not recommend ordering this product, since you have no idea what you will get!"
1,Bucket? Bucket? Who's got the bucket?,"If you order this bucket from Amazon, they will send you a cheese slicer. When you tell them about it, they will send a bucket replacement--another cheese slicer! Pretty insane, huh? But it's a fact. And then they say sorry, can't replace it. Sad for me that I also ordered (and received)the tote that is specially designed for this bucket and a pricey mop that goes with this bucket. Now I have a tote with no use and a mop that is too big for any other bucket. Ah, my New Year's resolution of buying great cleaning supplies bit the dust at Amazon."
4,good non-album tracks,"Strange thing is: the non-album tracks are better than the song this CD's named for. ""City Noise"" is a real nice whistful, bittersweet track, and the Pixies cover is good too. Worth it if you like the band."
4,6 Year Old Gamer and Mom,"I puchased this game for my son last Christmas (age5). This is a favorite of his. He gets through the levels pretty easily, with practice. With this game I can expect him to play for a hour but usually longer. This game is age appropriate. The levels teach patience, rembering skills and ""How to"" solve skills. The graphics are really great and the adventure to the next level is some what repetitious but, he loves this game.Parents, can feel safe with this non-violent game (bonking monkeys) and the kids will enjoy it."
2,OXO Steel Wine Pourer,"While the wine pourer works as advertised I am disappointed that the company appears to have discontinued the wine stopper I was originally seeking. I was after the pourer that came with a ""flapper"" at the top that acted to preserve the freshness of the wine in between tastings. While the above item fits the bill as a spout I personally find it useless."
5,A Must Have,I first heard Bob Marley's music in the 80's. A firend of the family had the Legend cd. I was immediatley entranced by the upbeat happy music and the mellow voice of marley. Since then I have evolved into a huge fan of all of his music. If you are going to buy one marley album than buy this one! It includes most of his more popular songs on discs 3 and 4. The first two discs are the gem of the set though in my opinion. The acoustic medley on disc two is numbing and the first disc showcases his talents at a young age. I was fortunate to have bought the set back in 92 when it was originally released and came with a booklet of song descriptions as well as a brief history of the Marley. Although this set does not contain the book it is still a must have for the music content alone. Wether you're an avid fan or a casual listener this cd is a must have. It is over 4 hours of great music. I guarantee that anyone who buys this album will fall in love with it.
5,BOB MARLEY!,All I can say is close your eyes and open your ears and mind. Bob's music is timeless and is to be enjoyed by everyone!
4,Great Introduction to Bob Marley,"I found out about this album through Pandora. After searching for it on Amazon, i found out it was a four cd set. This is an excellent introduction into Bob Marley, as the compilation contains his early as well as later work. If you would like to learn more about Bob Marley's music, this is a definite must buy. Oh, i was surprised though that the case itself and the cd covers were made out of cardboard. i would have preferred some type of jewel case, other than that it is great."
4,What I Got Was Great.......,i bought the 4 cd box set and i guess i got a special deal because mine only came with 3 of the disks....but the three i got were still worth it....Great!
5,Bob Marley - Songs of Freedom,"I don't have a lot to add, other than to say, look at the breakdown of the reviews - it's almost exclusively 5-stars. And for good reason.I received this Marley 4-CD box set waaaaay back in 1993 as a birthday present, and I still listen to it to this day, almost 20 years later!It is hands-down the best box sets you can ever buy. It's one of my Desert Island Top CD's, and I've gone through literally thousands of CD's over the last 20+ years.Listening to the music on these CD's is almost something of a religious experience; it's the power of really good music to truly move you (drug-induced or not).I cannot recommend these Songs of Freedom enough. You should skip ""Legend"" and just buy this. But be warned, you may end up purchasing all of Bob's individual albums afterward."
5,This is Bob's art and his music.,"If you like good earthy reggae you will very much enjoy these recordings. The entire package is put together well. Nice chronology of songs. But best of all there are so many moving tunes by Bob and his group, deeply felt and flowing. If you embrace this style of music you can get lost in this set for days with nothing else but 'her' or 'him' and the sea, the wind, the moon, and drink to the rapture. Yah mahn."
5,The only multi disc set from Marley one should own!,"This was first released as a limited edition. If one is looking to move on from Legend- which to me is for amateurs- look no further. This set has a wide variety yet is so consistently brilliant. One of the best box sets period! One problem with Marley being so good is that after digesting all of his talent, other reggae artists, even the stars like Burning Spear and Steel Pulse seem to pale in comparison- Oh well- Worth every cent and then some!"
4,Incredible book,"This book is really amazing. I work for an operating foundation that works with children in foster care. This book is an amazing look at the ""other side"" of the fence. So often we hear from the child's perspective, or from the state's perspective...so good to hear from the foster parents, the ones who raise these kids. Great book."
4,Good read for child caregivers,"I liked this book. Was a great read, I work with children and it makes me realize that all children can be a challenge no matter what background they come from. I enjoyed the honesty and the importance of telling the reader what she had ot ential on a daily basis with the foster children in her care. I have read many foster care related books and some of them judge and compare and beg the reader not to become a foster parent. This book, on the other hand, wasn't in comparison to those. Yes, there was some griping about the kids but most of it was aout how each situation was different and how she was trying to help the children but got no help or good communication from the welfare offices or social workers.I would recommend to any foster parent and to anyone who works with special needs children."
1,My views of Memoirs of a baby stealer,"I purchased this book because I am interested in learning about fostercare. I have to say it was only mildly helpful. I did get a little information about how the department of Family and childrens services vs private agencys work, or do not work together. I feel tho the author uses the book to work out her own personal issues. While her work with these children is commendable. She seemed to be doing fostercare as a way to pay the bills. Most of the time she was too involved to be much help with these children. Perhaps she would make a better child advocate. In all I was less than pleased with the book. The book has little realtime information."
5,Read this book!!!!!!,"A thoroughly interesting and provocative book. It makes you wonder why we continue to ""follow the leader"" in Aids research...listen to this guy....he's on to something."
1,A dangerous book and man,"I called up the author a few years back, pretending to be an hiv infected husband with a non-infected wife. The author insisted that there was no need for me to protect her against hiv because, he said, hiv was harmless. This guy is a crackpot. Do not believe anything in this book because if you check his references, you will see that he is very selective about what he includes and what he does not. What is his motivation? I think he enjoys being a renegade and to heck with the consequences. Not to be taken seriously."
1,Please support your hypothesis by injecting HIV!!!,"Fascinating hypothesis which has done considerable damage to lagging efforts to prevent the spread of this deadly AIDS- causing virus. Drs. Duesberg and Mullis should put their money where their mouth is and have a purified HIV injection just to prove their point. Oh yeah, no anti-retrovirals since they won't be necessary.....Truly shameful that they are making money off of the controversy."
1,Debunked,This would all be nice except we have isolated HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) and now have a picture.False hope and misleading information. Period.
1,Only read this if you can check the references.,"You should only read this book if you have access to a good medical library where you can check Duesberg's references. If you do this, you will find that he consistently leaves out a lot of relevant data. In other words, he's intellectually dishonest. Taken by itself (i.e. without the medical library), the book seems very convincing and scientific. But please, do not read this book without having access to the scientific articles he cites."
1,"No, No,No.","Oh dear. This book is dreadful, and quite simply, wrong.Just because many of these reviewers want this book to be true does not make it true - it just makes these reviewers delusional.Please do not be fooled by this unscientific and illogical book. And if you are HIV-positive, please do not listen to him - for your own health.AIDS is simply late-stage HIV. The debate has moved on from the semantics of HIV/AIDS and on to how to use medical science to help others."
1,Egomaniac garbage!!!,"This is surely the worst book I've ever read and one of the few I regret I read. When you read a bad book, at least you're learning something. But with this one, you're in danger of learning wrong things.After 6 years in Medicine College and now in my doctorship in HIV research, I can only make one question to all the Duesberg lovers and to that egomaniac himself: if you are so sure that HIV and other retroviruses don't cause disease, why don't you all inject them on your blood stream? Maybe because you're doing it all to show up..."
5,Why doesn't anybody challenge this book?,"I found this an excellent book and a great essay on philosophy and sociology of science as well as medicine. The way that a dogma about HIV and AIDS has formed exemplifies Thomas Kuhn's description on dogmatism in science (see his The structure of scientific revolution). And Karl Popper wouldn't be happy at all about the ""HIV causes AIDS"" conjecture about which nobody has answered the simplest question: what evidence would the scientific community accept that would reject this conjecture?..."
4,"When in Doubt of the HIV Hypothesis, Read this Book!","If Duesberg, in this meticulously prepared book, does not actually CONVINCE you that HIV does NOT cause AIDS, then he will at least provide you reason to doubt HIV's role. He relentlessly reveals again and again the ""un-pluggable"" holes in the HIV-AIDS hypothesis. At the same time, he offers his own perspective on the causes of AIDS-related diseases, namely excessive use of recreational drugs over many years. He argues his point very convincingly. Finally, being someone myself who is involved in what Duesberg refers to as ""Command Science,"" he is absolutely on-target with his criticisms of the U.S. governmental/pharmaceutical/medical establishment. This book really opened my eyes; it will open yours too."
5,Why don't more people know about this movie?,I wish the price would drop so I can see it again. It's been about 10 years since I last saw it and still laugh at the lines. Great cast that really gels. Up there with Caddy Shack.
2,Bavarian Luminati?,"Bavarian Luminati? Not very believable. Anyone whose studied Lara Cross will have a hard time swallowing that one. East LA Latinos counseling rich ladies to be careful with their pets since Vietnamese may eat their Pomeranians? ""Their hind legs look so fresh and juicy"". Like I haven't hear that joke before. Feigning sexual intercourse with Grouse (only the uninitiated would confuse a Grouse with a Cornish game hen)? And debating sex with a turkey? Henny Youngman did that bit back in the fifties in Catskils. Totally derivate humor. 2 stars out of 5 -- and I'm being generous.For something new and funny see Bowling for Columbine. 4 stars. He does a gag with some farm animals and comic imitating the ex-Iranian spokesman Goatsbyday that will leave you rolling in the aisles. (What do iranian men do when woman won't put out at night? ""Goatsbyday"".I can't hear that enough.)"
5,About time...,"""SOLD!"" I've been waiting for this to be released on DVD. Classisc Paul Rodriguez. Haven't seen this film since mid 1980's, but I still remember the lines. Amadeus, Amadeus, rock me Amadeus! Don't sleep on this one."
4,whoopee boys,this was a old school movie that I just happened to find was jonesing for some old school flicks the product was in exclient condition and works well.
1,The Whoopee Boys,"I heard Paul Rodriguez mention this movie on the radio before doing a show at the Improv here in town. It was aweful. This movie had a story that was very hard to follow. Paul Rodriguez's character was very annoying, and so was every other character. It almost seemed as somebody picked up a camera and was making up the whole plot as the movie went on. Don't waste your money on this.The Whoopee Boys"
5,loved it!!!!,it is so funny you will want to watch it over and over again...i have! it will keep us laughing for years to come.
5,Lackawana Blues,"Bought this CD for my husband who loves this kind of music! He listens to the CD all the time.IF you love Jazz and music from the 30's & 40""s you will love this CD also."
5,Drama! Adventure! Romance! This one has them all!,"When I first heard of this book, I was leery. Here is a lengthy novel from an unheard-of author dealing with a controversial subject. I opened it up and read the first paragraph. Nice intro! Okay, I'll read some more! And more...and more...I couldn't put it down!The storytelling is beautiful! You find yourself becoming part of the story and can easily identify with the characters. At times, it becomes a little difficult to follow because there is so much going on and a tremendous amount of characters, but everything gets put right back into perspective!A real page-turner of a novel that I would recommend to anyone who loves fantasy, science fiction, adventure, even romance novels (though this is anything BUT a romance novel!!!).A classic good-vs-evil struggle with some really interesting twists!"
2,Just too much,"Even Disney is a little dark, and some stories with tragic portions have beautiful endings. This book has a good concept at large ""even little people can do extaordinary things"" but some things were to vague while other things were just way too complex. Overmole/God a tough concept to just throw in especially in the context it was used. The dragons were dubious, at the end of the book my son had lost the whole concept of the book because he was too concerned about where the dragons were, was anyone safe, were they coming back and would this little mole have no Daddy if he fought the dragons? The book throws out a dozen great concepts and uses a great real life model of heroism but doesn't really deliver on any one of them fully."
1,What were they thinking?,"Ok, let's think of the most horrific event of our times and rehash it for the children.I just want to know WHAT were they thinking.My boy picked this out at the library because he loves all things cute and fuzzy. We came home to delve into a re-creation of hell on earth. My kids don't know about what happened on Sept. 11th, so for them it was just another book poorly written (especially when unbeknownst to them I'm editing and censoring on the fly, leaving key information out of the story...perspiring over whether brave mole would be going home to baby mole and how I'd explain that one). As for the kids who know what transpired on that fateful day, I say,""Why put it in fuzzy-wuzzy form and force them to relive the horror?""I understand the need to artistically express the pain and emotion of what happened, but can we not subject the kids to the wars of their fathers? At least until they can understand what it all really means. Ugh."
2,i think this song's should have a good frontpage.,i haven't listen the song but i think the song will nice to listen so first i give a review. i did not where i could buy this album. i want to download the song into my computer... could you send me a sample song so i could download it into my computer.i like to listen to the music that can let me feel like i didnot have any problem and feel free .
3,"Reasonably good, could have been better","As gaming guide for bellaonline.com, I spend a good portion of my time testing games and reading the strategy guides to see if I missed anything. I *love* Red Alert as a game, but this book doesn't quite do justice to it. The maps they give you are pretty hideous, and the descriptions they give of the solutions to missions are often extremely vague. I realize it's hard to do a walkthrough for a game like this, but there are usually methods that work very well for a mission, and they simply don't give you those details. The first 60 pages are wasted on troop reviews! I like their tip system, and feel they were on the right track ... they just didn't quite get there."
3,WAS SHAKEN TANYA BABY?,I'M JUST A GUY NAMED STEWIE I LOVE TO SING FOR EXAMPLE:MEOW!MEOW!MEOW!MEOW!MEOW!MEOW!MEOW!MEOW! MEOW!MEOW!AND ANOTHER EXAMPLEIS:LA!LA!LA!LA!LA!LA!LA!LA!LA!
5,Christian SCIFI,If your looking for Christian based science fiction then this is the book for you. This book is unique in it's dual outlook as both a chistian future & science fiction/futuristic basis.
1,Ridiculous Ending,"I read this book about 5 years ago and after reading it I thought it was a load of cr@p. The ending was a real anticlimax and totally abrupt. I think the book is a metaphor, planets=countries, satan is everywhere, good guys finish last etc..Seemed to me that the author was on some self indulgent trip to write this transparent work of the banal...."
4,My children's view.,"My children were quite relieved when I read this book to them. It (the book) helped me explain what the war in Iraq was about and what 9/11 was about. Some of us, as parents, have a difficult time explaining such things as this. This book helps. Thank You!"
1,Anything to make a buck..,"I can only assume that this is meant to be a joke. From the samplings, it seems that not only the quality suffers, but no one can match axl's tone or slash's masterful licks.. This should definitely be considered a poor excuse for a tribute, but more importantly a failure as a compilation of music."
2,The mistake I made.,"Simply put, the mistake I made was that I bought this album. I was not familiar with any of the artists on this album. With few exceptions, most of the tracks sound like crap, (especially Cory Clarke's version of ""Paradise City""), and that's putting it micely. The first two tracks were awesome, but then I got to Kevin Dubrow's version of ""Welcome to the Jungle"". He has No business whatsoever singing that song. He and Cory Clarke butchered there selected covers by trying too hard to sound like Axl. That was a feat at which they fell horribly short. Axl's voice was singing and screaming at the same time. Their's was just screaming, and because of that they sounded horrible. Over all, this album is not worth buying."
4,Rock tribute to gnr review,"Listen up people im the biggest guns n roses fan of all time but this is not guns n roses , its realy good imitations of gnr and its ok I realy like it . The performers did one hell of a job on these songs, and the hole album is pretty solid but dont mistake this to be a new gnr album becaues its not that is the only problem i have with the hole album.sincerely Ben28645"
1,What the [heck] is this [junk]?,"Who are these people? Did someone go around in a minivan, pick up some coffee house jokers, and ask them to sing hard rock? This is hardly a tribute! These people should get famous writing their own stuff, because it's sounds like they could cover their own [butt]!Get a real GNR cd or, better yet, DON'T! I'd rather not support a racist jerk like AXL anyway!"
1,Does not come with hardware or instructions!,"This bottle cage is OK-it seems a little flimsy, but would probably do the job... I can't say for sure because the screws were not included, so I can't actually use it yet. Over the years I've bought lots of bike accessories-headlight, taillight, rack, mirror, etc, and I've never had this problem before. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM unless you want to spend your Saturday wandering around Home Depot trying to eyeball the size screw you need."
2,poorly made,"shipping and service was great. The magnet has broken on 4 of 5 already over the 1st month. Dont get this one if you have kids or animals. If no one or nothing will ever touch it, this cheaper version of the product will work fine."
3,Works as expected - but pretty cheap quality.,"This works just like you want it too, but man is it cheesy. I have 2 of them, for two floor vents that were really needed but in poor locations. This works to blow the air out into the room, but they are very cheaply made. I am not unhappy with them or my purchase, but just don't expect anything classy ! As a side note, if you have to buy them mail-order as I did get them from Amazon where the shipping was cheaper ! Shipping from Ace Hardware direct was ridiculously expensive ! Go to your local Ace Hardware - it's cheaper."
3,Good overview - but do more work,"Sova has done a great job compiling a wide list of topics into concise overviews. Everything from individual works by Poe to people in Poe's life are presented. With that said, however, be careful with this book! There are quite a few inaccuracies ranging from the slight (a typo gave the original title of ""The City in the Sea"" as ""The Domed City"" rather than ""Doomed"") to the patently incorrect (the timeline at the back of the book gives Poe's date of death as October 8, rather than the 7th). This book should give you a good place to start with your inquiries regarding Poe, but you might have to do some more research to follow-up."
3,Just OK,No subtitles - which makes watching this very frustrating if you don't hear well. As for the story - just OK. The lead actor is annoying. I never feel convinced by it. The writing is quite amateur. No real meat to it. Plenty of eye candy though which really is the only reason to watch it.
3,Queen of the North Shore,"This is a good book, well put together book on a fabled Chicago suburb. I would have liked to have seen more pictures and better quality in the photos. The research is top notch and I enjoyed reading the text, but I expected more and for some reason that I can't quite put my finger on I was a bit disappointed. I usually go back to my books over and over again to paruse the pictures and scan the text, but I have not found myself doing that with this book and I don't know exactly why, because I normally love these kinds of books. Anyway, it is a fine book and maybe it's just me."
4,Ribbon,This is not my first purchase of this product. The price is definitely a deciding factor. Good price!
2,Fragments of 50 performances,"I understand this is a discount classical music collection, and with all due respect to the person who gave this to me as a Christmas present, I was consistently aggravated while listening to these CD's, because a good number of the movements were cut off after two and a half minutes. Ridiculous! The CD appears to contain complete Mozart symphonies, but in fact only the beginning of each movement is included. It's like listening to an album at the Barnes and Noble kiosks. You just get a taste. Unless you're only looking for inoffensive background music, save your six dollars until you're ready to pony up for a halfway decent Mozart CD.Oh, and there's no credit given to any of the performers, so it's hard to say where this music came from, unless you have a more experienced ear than mine."
2,"Great photos, but that's it",A nice coffee table book with some excellent photography of aircraft nose art from WWI to modern day. However the text is frustratingly shallow and often misinformed about the subject matter of the art itself. Let the pictures tell the story and skip the text.

2,Poor quality reprint,"This thing looks like a student got a copy of the original off eBay, scanned it in and printed it at Kinkos. Cheesy and close to illegible in parts. This seems to be the new NatLampCo mode of operation. Grave rob their own material and release poor quality reissues. Very sad, too bad. Echoes of the great read it was, but kind of like digging up Marilyn's corpse for a shag."
3,Functional,"The program seems to work as expected. I haven't had a chance to create more than a few characters, but I've run into no trouble as of yet.I have experienced no issues with the program in terms of poor performance. Unlike the previous user, I can minimize and restore the program without a problem. The program works quite quickly for me. I have used the program on two separate systems with no issues at all. Granted they are both above-average systems in terms of power, so if you have an older system your experience may differ."
1,Farpatchket,"Us Jewish people have a saying called - Farpatchket, meaning to tinker and toy with something so much one only makes things worse trying to make it better.The program is buggy, confusing, and compare to it's predecessor - a mess. I will give it a star for a nicer printing format although why I had to download and add in a spread sheet to put in a character portrait I'll never understand as it should be a basic feature.Beware! Takes a LONG time to open, and heaven forbid you minimize the character you're working on you will have to exit to open it again. I just haven't figured out another way."
5,Always the same with Netrebko,"Anything this phenomenon sings is exquisite to listen to. I am an opera lover for 70 years and have never heard anything like this. She is even more enjoyable to see, and if it could get any better, it does when paired with Rolando Villazon. What a shame they do not do more recordings together. Can't help but wonder what behind-the-scenes reason there might be."
5,Massenet <Manon is a lyrical triumph and a thrill that haunts you well after you have been listening to the actual dvd,"Long after watching the opera your mind is haunted by the beautiful music. Rolando Villazon's interpretation is what I have dreamed about all my life. He is the lyrics, and feels what the artist Massenet must have wanted to express when he created the opera. French music is a new high for me!"
3,What a show...but very a little flavor of opera comique,"This production is a beautiful show to watch. The cast is exciting, but so little French. So, if you do not pay too much attention to the pronunciation, then you will enjoy the creamy and lyric voice of Ms Netrebko, who portrays a strong Manon, dedicated to pleasure (see L'hotel de Transylvanie act). Villazon is, as always, very (some would say too much) involved in his character, but his voice was, at that time (2006), still responding (though he is asking too much). However, Faisons un reve is sung with beautiful pianissimi. Barenboim is not to be mentionnned as the sound of the orchestra is international and not Massenet.Generally speaking, a overall good production, but French is not the best quality of Ms Netrebko."
3,on n'aura pas toujours 20 ans,"Netrebko delights in showing us her waning 20 ans. Her singing is sometimes nerve wracking - constantly changing registers. Villazon is steady and lofty in voice, and honest in acting. Interesting production but not too interesting."
4,"Es maravillosa, pero hay que ver a Gruberova","Netrebko y Villazon son maravillosos, pero la version de Gruberova-Araiza es tambien hermosa, no se la pierdan."

4,I love it.. Easy Easy to Follow,"I have 2 videos and 2 books now, and this one is good.. Videos are too fast and the concept is not learned. My other book is too advanced. But this book begins slowly and teaches the concept slowly using the first exercises to learn the technique.. of breathing and moving in sinc. By using Lynne Robinsons video to learn to breath and begin the process, along ith this book to begin the gentle moves.. I have found a system for me.."
1,Fair Warning,"I thought I could get a violin for my son to learn and not spend a lot of money.Now I know better.This violin arrived in unplayable condition.The customer service was ridiculous; who has ever heard of having to email photos of a product prior to receiving return shipping instructions???After emailing four photos and doing my best to describe what was wrong with an instrument that I am not familiar with I am finally mailing the violin back today. Let's hope my refund is prompt, at least!"
2,"Nothing against the product, but it wasn't what I wanted.","I ordered this to fix some cracks in my ceiling and was disappointed when it arrived. DAP products are great, and I'm sure this product will work well for it's intended purpose. I ordered it not realizing this product is for ""textured"" surfaces. I didn't know there were two types of Elastopatch and it certainly wasn't labeled well on the product page. I hope the description and title are changed to avoid future customer frustration."
5,Cafe Del Mar Aria Pt.1,"A masterpiece... A musical delight guaranteed to drain the tear ducts...If one isn't a classical music maven, this album should at the very least make one curious.."
5,review,"great product. plug and play basically, i have 5 speakers set up around my dorm room and this adapter let me play all 5 speakers at once for great surround sound"
2,"""Surround Sound"" is a technical term","Buyer beware.Going from a two-channel RCA signal (the white and red wires from your console) into a converter does not convey true DISCREET surround sound. Yes, you are ""surrounded"" by sound, but discreet surround sound means that the game/DVD's 5 independent sound signals are preserved when passed through to their respective speakers. All this adapter does is take a two-channel signal and allow it to be re-mixed and ported into a fake 5.1 surround sound signal. It does not create true surround sound. This adapter only allows for an emulated 5.1 experience, not a true 5.1 experience.And yes, most Logitech speaker systems already come with this adapter, so be sure you check on the back of the box or in the online item description before you buy this."
2,"Great haste, bad product.","I was very pleased to receive this adapter quite promptly, in brand-new packaging, never having been opened. For such a low price, this adapter seemed to be the perfect answer to a problem I had been facing for a long while, only to find that when I tried to hook it up for the first time, one of the bands wasn't making a connection. I tried the same jack in every other plug and it worked fine, but the one plug only made connection with one of the two bands on the jack, leaving me with no front-right sound. A defective product delivered blindingly fast is still no solution to my problem. I guess I continue to search elsewhere for a cheap, effective means of surround sound...."
2,Meh...,"K so I bought the Logitech x-530 5.1 speakers with full intent of having awesome surround sound on my xbox 360...problem: this adapter that came with the speakers DOES NOT give you full surround sound. If you already have it, you can know this by running a game's surround sound test like the Halo 3 one, when the grunt says ""speaker behind you over there"" it is not solely coming from the back speakers, it still comes from the front speakers, and the center speaker does not get it's dedicated Dialog channel. :( It made me sad."
1,Did not even receive,"I have been promptly charged for this plug however, have not even received it. Very poor service."
4,handy,This is great and handy for connecting a surround sound system to a computer system. It does the job and it a good little piece of equipment.
3,A Cheap Solution For an Old PC Problem.,"I used this part for a six year old PC that didn't have a sound card. The sound quality going through my home theater system was OK, but not optimal. Sadly, the only good solution is a new PC, but this is a great alternative for those that don't have the larger funds for a sound card and/or a new system.Note: You must have your own cords for the unit. The adapter comes without any extra wiring."
4,"Prompt, and accurate","Prompt shipping, accurate description, the right part for the setup. The price was right. I'm enjoying my audio setup with this adaptor making the link. Great for iPhone!"
3,Excellent!,"Works like a charm. I'm surprised how only Logitech has a product like this. It should be more widely available. I am able to hook up my Altec Lansing ADA995's to my XBOX 360 now. If you only have stereo input, you'll get stereo sound. If you have a method of Dolby, say a receiver or such, you can get 5.1 true surround. Awesome purchase!"
5,Worked for me,"I purchased this adapter so that I could use a nice set of computer speakers with my TV/DVD player. It works just great, and I've run into no problems. I think it's a good deal relative to the price, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for the same."
5,Great product.,"Mine was really cheap, so it was worth it. This product worked great and gave me no troubles. As for the price, I only had to pay about $3 for mine, so I have no comment on the regular price."
4,"Simple, effective, economical","For those of us who A) would rather not deal with a bulky and expensive external 5.1 Surround Sound audio card or B) needs to actually connect a console to their 5.1 system, this is a wonderful tool. While it does not actually split the system into six channels as a sound card might, the adapter divides the signal left and right and utilizes the sub-woofer and center speaker quite effectively.For what it is designed to do, the adapter is quite small, sturdy, efficient. If like me, you are using this as a way around the sound card, you'll need a stereo plug - dual RCA adapter cable which you can plug into the headphone jack.I would certainly recommend this device."
2,Doesn't fit the way it should,"I had thought that an official accessory for a stove would lay across the stove like it was designed to go with it. This griddle is more than a one-burner, but less than a 2-burner. At least it's the right depth.Aside from that, it cracked on our first use. I was as careful as I could be to bring the heat up slowly, hoping to avoid a crack, but it popped anyway. Usable, but disappointing."
5,Sure To Make Westlife US Stars,"I'm a huge Boyzone fan, and hearing that Boyzone frontman (and object of my obssession) Ronan Keating is Westlife's manager, I decided to give the lads a try. Every song is excellent. My personal favorite is #17 ""Can't Lose What You Never Had."" ""Swear It Again"" is their first US single release, and so far it is steadily climbing. Even if that song doesn't break through, there are so many amazing songs on this album, that I have no doubt one of them will rocket Westlife into superstardom. I am so happy that Westlife are going the route that my Boyzone unfortunately haven't gone yet, and are getting some recognition here in the States. Buy their album when it is released domestically on April 4th. You won't regret it!"
4,Brilliant,"There r good points about this CD and bad songs about it. The good thing is that many song sounds pretty good and stuff. But the bad thing is that almost every song have the almost same rythm and music in it, I mean, it's pretty similar. But I still recommend it to ppl who likes music."
2,A Waste of Money at Any Price,"I loved the pump feature until I had to refill it. I asked 2 engineers and a culinary specialist to try, we all failed. I was EXTREMELY disappointed."
2,Great until you need to refill,This works great until you need to refill. I broke the salt and can not open the pepper. Very hard to refill.
1,Even the replacement pump does not work!,Great pump until it was time to refill... Every member in the household gave it a try. Send Olde Thompson an e-mail complaining that it was impossible to open. They send me a new one after I pointed out the life time warranty. Now the replacement needs a refill and guess what? This one does not open either. After reading the reviews of others I realize that it is not me. It just went into the trash. Do not waste your money on this model and save yourself a lot of agrevation.
1,Old Thompson Peppermill Pump,"This is a piece of garbage! Originally, I thought I was the only one who could not open it to refill. Definitely not worth $25+."
1,Would not grind after filling,Purchased this pump grinder as I have been looking for a grinder that doesn't clog up and that I can use easily. Did not have trouble filling as we followed the directions attached to the grinder but it would not grind any of the peppercorns. It does not turn when pressing the pump. Must have gotten a lemon!!!! Will be returning this for replacement as it says LIFETIME WARRANTY on the attached card.nanange733@aol.com
1,How I wish it were forgotten...,"This is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen. The acting is lifeless and wooden and the cinematography is reminiscent of a highschool drama project. The cast is attractive enough enough to make the movie enjoyable so long as the sound is turned off. Contrary to other reviewers, it's not sweet or special or honest or witty, it's contrived and awful and, simply put, bad."
1,this is a load of toss,Don't bother with this low budget gay themed movie. The lead character cant act and he isn't engaging enough. The story is a bit weak and not credible. Although it is set in a nice part of the U.S. it was almost laughable
1,"Please, save your money!","This could possibly be the cheesiest movie I have ever seen (and I have seen a lot of movies!) Do not waste your money on this low-budget, low-acting-ability, low-camera-experience movie. I enjoy a good ""gay movie"" every now and then and this was not it. Sorry to disappoint!"
1,I give it less than ONE STAR.,"The only thing I saved from my purchase of this DVD was the case. It is one of the slowest paced movies I have seen, and I remember what families did before TV. If I was in a theater I'd have asked for my money back. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope I hadn't wasted my money. This is a great way of learning how not to write dialogue. This movie is B A D and I mean ""bad""!pjKeller"
4,Good and worth watching,"This is a sweet, independent film. At times it shows its low-budget nature, but it has a pretty good and touching story line. It does try a bit too hard in places, but the acting is good (except for one woman) and the affection/sex between the two men is moving. It's not esp. erotic or anything, but it rings true and is tender--all too rare in films these days! NB: lthough there is some mystery in the film, I would NOT call it ""riveting"" as the box describes it. I thought it was reminiscent of (albeit not as strong as) Big Eden in its best parts. I'd like to see more story lines like this. We've had enough of the psychologically twisted LGB storylines (e.g., most of Strand Releasing)."
4,11 Film Festivals and still going!,"This is a great movie that came out of nowhere. Made on a shoestring by first time filmmakers and an inexperienced cast, this indie feature hit the festival circuit to sold out shows. After 11 film festivals, both US and international, the movie comes to DVD.""Gone, But Not Forgotten"" tells the story of forest ranger Drew Parker and a man he rescues who is suffering from amnesia. As the man recovers, the two fall in love. However, when his old life comes back to reclaim him, he must decide who he is, and who he really loves.Audiences have enjoyed this indie flick, voting it Festival Favorite in Austin and Philadelphia's gay film festivals. The movie was also the Closing Night Film in Long Island.DVD FEATURES: Director Michael Akers commentary with actor Matthew Montgomery and Producer Sandon Berg. Trailer. Outtakes.94 minutes, color, stereo, region 1.OFFICIAL SITE: www.gonebutnotforgotten-themovie.com"
1,Disappointing,"From previous reviews I was expecting this movie to be above average. Instead it is a huge disappointment. It looks and sounds like a cheap soap opera done on a shoe string budget. The story line is thin and the acting rather average. I do not recommend buying this DVD, rent it if you must"
4,Not Easily Forgotten,"This is a small budget indi film that will settle into your heart. The idea of repressed desire and living as others wish you would live was the same theme touched on in films such as Big Eden. Director Michael Akers gives a warm and touching story of a man looking for love and another who doesn't even know who he is or what his life was like before the accident. These 2 are truly likable characters. Rounding out the cast is the brother who doesn't know how to express his love or frustrations, his Christian wife, the town doctor who's devotion to Drew transcends his sexuality and a shrewish wife who makes you understand why Mark would want to forget his past. Fine acting and storyline that keeps you hoping that love wins out. There is no preaching, no fear of AIDS, just a single gay man looking for his soulmate. What could possibly be wrong with a movie like that?"
2,Rent before buying...,"As a fan of gay romance films, I want to like this film, but can't. While low production values are apparent throughout the film, what really kills it is the slow pacing and mediocre acting (though I'm sure the actors gave it their best). If the script, filming and acting had developed the drama and/or the romance this would be a decent film. While realistic in parts and far-fetched in others, this film has all the excitement of watching a home movie of someone's picnic or wedding, etc. Next time, I hope the writer-director comes up with a more tightly-paced script that engages the viewer rather than slowly plodding along."
3,a little less smirking perhaps,"The two actors are quite likeable but the delivery needs tightening up - seems that a lot of the time is spent looking at each other, waiting for the next guy to deliver his lines - and they do sound like they're being read, not delivered from the heart, and please, when will gay film makers or those making films of gay interest realize that it's okay to dress the set so a house looks like it is actually lived in instead of simply an empty cabin they came across in the wilderness."
1,BETTER OFF FORGOTEN!!!!!!!,"Anyone who saw this film and gave this more that a 1 star rating must have been on some powerful halucingens to think this movies was anything other than a complete waste of time. Sure it looks good by the cover and the summary, but when I had a group of friends over to all watch this for the first time, we instantly realized why none of us had heard of this movie before. Even porn has higher callibur acting, cinematography, and dialog than this movie! The only saving grace to watching this film was the alcohol on hand to stomach it and having 8 catty friends openly rip it apart Like Tom Servo on Mystery Science Theater! DO NOT BUY THIS FILM! (luckily I got it as a gift)."
1,Blech.,"This trite movie had the production quality of a student project, the acting of a bad soap opera and the heavy-handed story-telling generally found in an English 101 class. I kept waiting for this film to improve, but the only improvement that came along was when the credits started to roll. Don't waste your time."
1,Best Forgotten!,I'm not gonna go into a lot of detail about the plot of this movie but instead I'm gonna focus on the two things that were truely horrible with this film. The acting was an atrocity. I've seen better performances at high school plays. The dialogue was equally bad and you will find yourself nodding off for most of this film. The one thing that was done well (moderately) in the film was the love scene...which was not graphic but slow and sensual. Other than that there is nothing good to say about this dvd. The best thing about this dvd was the cover. Do yourself a favor and skip this one. A complete waste of time!
1,Don't Bother!,"I have never been so glad to NOT have paid full price for a movie. The production is horrible, the story line is pathetic and the acting is nonexistent. At least they could have gotten someone, gay or straight, to play a ""believable"" gay forest ranger. If you actually could get into fantasizing about a 'queen' forest ranger, you'd still have to weed through all the life-leasons the producer/director crammed into the movie. The only good thing about this movie, if there is one, was the somewhat attractive 'straight' brother and his wife. (Although the fake slap was pretty terrible.) My suggestion, borrow this from someone if you want to see it - don't buy it!"
3,"Acting poor, story good","While just about every actor in this picture could use some practice, the story of a guy who has amnesia and meets up with another guy and develops a relationship is a good one. I just cringed several times at some very cheesy lines delivered in very flat ways."
3,dreary little film,"It was very hard to keep my attention on watching the movie, it moves so slowly, and with no realism whatever, the actors are very bad, the script is monotonous, the character of the female doctor is ludicrous.... but all told all of it could have been worse!!!"
1,Really bad,"The acting is poor, plot is way too simple. I know this is a low budget film, but the quality is too bad, like a home DV video."
1,one star should be gone,"the worst movie i have ever seen bad in every aspect of bad, exept for the hilarious directors commentory where he thinks it is good."
3,A pleasant diversion for the evening,"This is not the greatest story ever-told, but it is interesting, and the acting is quite respectable. If you want a shamelessly romantic gay love story, with a bit of a mystery in the storyline, this is your movie. No melodrama, no AIDS-subtext. Just a nice love story."
3,gone but not forgotten,I enjoyed this little independent film very much. The two leads were wonderful. The sex scene was done artistically instead of pornographic which was nicely filmed . I was glad to not hear in the commentary on how hard it was to kiss another guy or being intimate with a man. The only negative aspect of the film was the bad acting on the part of the actress that played the wife of the amnesiac.I would love to see a sequel made with the two men.
4,Not too bad,"Yes, this movie is low budget, but the story more than makes up for it. At first, I thought this story would be stupid, but it draws you in and then wins you over. It is worth the money."
2,Nothing special,"I got that title after to have read the generally very good reviews. I was however quite disappointed by this movie, its average plot, average acting (especially ""Mark"") and rather cliché ending."
5,The Heart outshines the Budget.,"I love this movie. A sweet gay loves story with two hot guys and a great love scene. How many gay stories are there about people who die, or the hardships of coming out? This is a story about two guys who get together. Although, it is not unrealistic. Any relationship, including gay relationships, can be hard if not supported by family/friends/society - this movie depicts that. Clearly this movie is independent - made for a low budget. But the movie has a very honest quality to it - the director was obviously able to do what he wanted to do, which I beleive was to make a sweet gay love story. Granted, the camera person should be shot on sight - the editing and score saves the movie from the incompetent camera work. This is a great love story - great because it it is simple and honest. The earnest and honest heart of the director shines through."
3,Sweet Low budget romance,"Ok, I purchased this based on an interesting premise and on some of the excellent reviews it received here on Amazon. Whilst I wasnt exactly dissapointed I wasnt exactly thrilled either...I must admit that I watched it once before consigning it to the shelf...unlike most of my movies which I can watch over and over again. Yes I know this was a low budget effort but surely that could have been disguised, and some of the acting as well as certain scenes are just not realistic. It gets three stars for effort but hardly what I would call 'riveting' rather a 'sweet' gay romance."
3,"Surmounting the low-budget obstacle, to tell a great story","This is definitely a film which should inspire film makers with low budgets to rise above those limitations to tell a great story. The two leads give amazingly nuanced performances. The screenplay didn't give either of these characters unbelievable dialogue which I think is the greatest accomplishment of this film. I didn't quite believe the Mark and Catherine marriage scenes, but they don't hurt the film overall. Aaron Orr and Matthew Montgomery do a great job and their chemistry on screen carries the film.I look forward to more from Michael D. Akers.Joe"
1,Gone but not forgotten... I already have!,For a film that has won such recognition and great reviews I was hoping for a real treat.I was left feeling why has this film been hyped so much?The story was dull the whole feeling of the film was just anticipation for something good to happen but it just does not deliver.I dont mind low budget aslong as the film has heart and you can really feel the emotion I was left cold.
2,Only OK,"Production value was really low on this film. More like a high school production. Story line and acting was mediocre. Bottom line not really worth the money. Go for Latter Days, very high quality story, production and acting."
2,Lifetime Channel for Gay Men (But Without Stars),"One always trys to be nice to gay films and it is not the film's fault that it lured me in with a hot cover. I will take full blame for that. But, and this is an important but, they must be better than than this, much, much better, better acted, better written, and better filmed. The acting was often so bad I kept expecting a porn film to break out. And this is not to say that the notion of a forest ranger falling in love with an amnesia victim is not sweet-sounding or that the two leads did not possess a certain visual charm, but everything was so obvious from the very start. Maybe I learned a lesson about judging a DVD by its cover, but I suspect not."
4,20 years later and it's still a fun game!,I enjoyed playing this game as a kid and still enjoy playing this game as an adult...it's actually more fun the second time around!
3,Looking for more,Interesting stories about the oddities of the Oregon Trail. I was looking for more depth and history of the trail.
5,One of the greatest puzzle games for NES,"The Adventures of Lolo was an original idea that produced what I believe is one of the top puzzle/adventure games ever. The way they constructed the action aspect to fit together perfectly with the puzzle/strategy aspect was seemless and flawless. Like the game or not, you have to respect the genius who came up with this idea."
5,U.S. News Ultimate Guide to Medical Schools,"Purchased this book to help our daughter decide which medical schools to apply to. Very informative with statistical data as to what each school looked for in regards to MCAT scores, GPA. Also gave stats on the number of interviews granted, acceptance rates, broken out by male/female, minority, etc. There is also a summary of current students' comments on how they felt about the school. Well worth purchasing."
4,Ultimate Guide to Medical Schools,"Some of the information is a little outdated, but is still very relevent and useful. It gave me some insight as to the whole process of applying ofr med school. I recommend this book to anyone considering applying to med school."
3,"OK, but...","It's kinda funny. But Ranma 18 is veeery similar to all the previous books. Pretty much all the plots are based on the old ""Akane-getting-mad-for-no-reason"" and ""Ranma-getting-blamed-for-something-he-didn't-do"" jokes. After 18 graphic novels they've pretty much lost all their effect. I got bored after reading about six Ranma, I can't imagine reading, let alone enjoying, all eighteen of them straight (I skipped #7-17)..."
5,Killing me softly with this song,"I heard this movie and song before, it's about a suicide hymn, many people suicide after listening. Anyway, I'm alive after I watched this movie and heard this song. Oppositely, I think this song is so much beautiful and movie is so much touching, although it has a little bit of sorrow and gloomy. I like this feeling, and I think the perfect love story must be a tragedy."
4,good soundtrack...where's the bloody film?,i dig the soundtrack...even the dancey heather nova track.when is the movie going to be released on dvd/vhs?i saw it at the theater and LOVED it.anybody know?
2,Disappointing coffee-table fluff,"As the first reviewer here notes, choosing ""the"" 70 great battles is bound to be controversial. I for one have to wonder about the absence of such great battles as Zama, the Catalaunian Plains and -- amazingly -- Austerlitz. Or the inclusion of Bosworth, Inkerman and Omdurman. I agree with including Manzikert, although the narrative glosses over the main consequence of the Byzantine defeat -- the permanent and ultimately fatal loss of Anatolia with its essential manpower. But Ankara shouldn't be here...yes, Timur won a great victory, but its effects were quite brief, and hardly slowed the rise of the Ottoman Empire.Some of the graphics and maps are useful, and others repetitive or frustratingly skimpy, but the narratives of each battle are really too flimsy to provide anything new to all but military history novices. This is a big, hefty volume of History-Lite which serious readers can easily live without."

3,No reverse click... OK otherwise,"This is an average, run-of-the-mill clicker wrench. It seems to be built well, has a reversible ratchet and a torque setting lock -- handy but standard.What it does not have, and it was not clear from the description, is that it only ""clicks"" one way. So if you ever need to torque a left-threaded fastener, you will need another wrench.Perhaps this alone won't move me enough to return it, but I wish I knew this in advance. Like you do now."
5,Adorable,"I bought this for my 7 year old and he loves it. It operates great, just like a real vending machine. I originally got this because I thought it was a good way for him to put money in a bank, but you don't need to put coins in it. I highly recommend this. It's so cute."
2,BLACKDOG,At first I thought it was great a little loud but so very cute....but then within a few months it stopped working.Now it is a cute warm can storeage container...would not recommend
1,dispense button broke first two weeks we had it,I am extremely upset! this was a Christmas present to my children for the game room they are older and did not misuse this fridge. the dispense button has stuck and keeps dispensing soda after two weeks of use REALLY!!!
3,defective machine,"bought a new koolatron vending fridge recently, plug in and turn on power, it did not power up, not working at all"
2,nice photos,"This book contains beautiful photos of the Fort Lauderdale area and might be a good souvenir. It is not the travel guide type of book I was looking for, although it does contain interesting information about the photos in the book."
4,Toilet Safety Rail,I bought 2 of these for my elderly mothers bathrooms when she said she needed something to hold on to when sitting down or getting up. Only thing she said was that she kept hitting her arm on it at first and it was in the way. But nothing said now so she must have gotten use to it. I found that when I was in the bathroom that they didn't bother me in the least bit. The only thing I noticed was they have slack or a little play in them so they do move some. Not sure if this is really an issue unless you are looking for something that will not move at all.
2,I had real problems,"Okay, maybe I'm pushing the limits of Final Cut Express doing 5-layer composites, but I routinely crash the program so badly on my 800mhz iMac that the program actually won't boot again until I throw away the User Preferences file. It also crashes if I try to adjust ""Brightness and Contrast"" and export the file as an AVI. Be warned -- it's better than iMovie but it does NOT have all the features of Final Cut Pro -- not even close. The motion commands are crippled and the software itself has yet to be updated, which indicates that Apple isn't making this a priority. I've tested FCP and found it has none of these problems, so I expect I'll have to upgrade."
3,"You must have ""made it"" when there is a tribute to you!","As a long time Styx fan, I was thrilled to see that there is a tribute album to this GREAT band. The covers are of the most air-played singles by some lesser-known players, with a few exceptions. But, they sound like they worked hard to make this a decent album to own. Particularly interesting is the 'club' mix of Too Much Time on My Hands... certainly an 'eye-opener'. Mr. Roboto sounds pretty good, although the production value of the CD seems a bit 'muted'. Maybe just me. Fooling Yourself and Grand Illusion are both worthy of your attention. Lady and Babe are a bit 'scratchy' by their performers.Is it worth it? Well, if you want to hear how others interpret Styx, then buy it! If you are looking for studio-like cuts from the group, then you might be disappointed.As a long-timer, it really means a lot to see your favorite band with an album of their material re-recorded by others. I say ""dig in""!"
2,Poor quality,Comb teeth are starting to melt from blow dryer heat. I used this with a hot tools dryer so I thought it would work fine--wrong.
1,Constantly falls off,"I do not recommend purchasing this product. The product constantly falls off of the dryer. I have tried every technique imaginable to get this product to stay on the dryer; but, despite my best efforts, the product falls off. There is no point in having this when it falls it constantly. Do not waste your money or time."
1,Not So Universal.,I have two hair dryers and this tool did not fit onto them. Was a waste of money and time.
5,Great product,"This is a great tool to straighten your hair easily while blow drying. It leaves your hair soft, silky and shiny!"
3,"Not great, just okay...","This game is okay. It's not nearly as fun as Sequence the board game. It will be a good learning tool for my kids though. It goes very quickly too, so that's a plus. My mom and I played it when I got it, but only played it two different times, and then didn't play it again, because it wasn't very fun or challenging."
4,Fun,"Not as great as the board game, but still a good game. Easily learned and a good thinking game for developing strategic skills for children. Relatively portable."
5,Great Game,"I am always looking for games to play with my disabled adult son that he can master but are not ""childish"". He likes sequence so I decided to try this one. This has the advantage of including a bit of adding (the sum of the die) to the game."
5,Maria,"What a great game!! We love to play as a family, but it is also a game that my children,ages 11 and 9, can play together. We were looking for a fun board game to get a break from the electronic world of games. This was a great choice."
5,Great addition to the sequence range,"We have the original game of sequence which we love playing (except for my husband as he always loses), so this was a nice second addition to our sequence game collection. Game doesn't take too long to play, and the rules are simple. Plus so far my husband has won the majority of the games we have played so he loves it!!"
4,nice toy,"Nice toy especially since it includes barrel car with two barrels (these by themselves are quite expensive). My son kept playing with it for several days in a row,--both with and without tracks. My only complaint is that there are lots of plastic parts (all green parts, the blades and upper red lever). For sure Learning Curve could think of how to make this more ""real wood"" as advertised on the packaging. Look for lower price...Amazon's prices fluctuate on this item a lot."
5,Wow my son loves this thing.,"This piece consists of a wooden base with train track and tunnel big enough for even Brewster, the flour mill takes barrels of flour in a side hatch and loads them into a V-shaped rolling stock. There are two flour barrels made out of wood. The windmill is unfortunately plastic [so far has not broken] and turns either by the lever in the back [my son loves this] or by the tried and true index finger.A nice feature is that the tower spins. Since my train table is pretty tight this was a must to avoid a bridge overhead. Of course my 3 year old keeps yanking it from the table to play with it but thats ok."
3,Lolo & Lala return.,"This game is very weird. I have not beaten all three but this one is very hard. In this game u r lolo the blue ball, and ur partner that follows u around is lala the pink ball. The story is that the king turns everyone into stone in the village so u (lala) have to go to trees that have a level number on it and beat it. This is a puzzle game so u have to push strff around to block things from shooting at u and avoid from geting hit by one of the enemys. I only got to the last level on the part of the village to unlock the rest of it before i lost. which is not very far. Each one of the levels is in a small area that has many items in it. Ur purpose is to get to however many treasure chests and get the key out and avoid getting hit. That is why it is a puzzle game u have to look and find a way to get to the chests by pushing things around. The password feature is very helpful to continue where u left off at since there is no saving. If u like hard puzzle games, this one is for u."
4,Good plate...bad drill template.,"The plate is very good. Little or no vibration when mounted to Bench Dog table. Then again, I don't have a 3hp router mounted. My issue is that the template is not dead on for the Milwaukee 2 1/4 Hp router. Luckily, drilling a bigger hole than required made it fit. It's still off center. My 3.5"" panel bit barely fit.I was lazy and trusted Bench Dog too much. You should check the BD template against your router base plate. I strongly suggest using a drill press."
5,Good Movie ...,"Good , that how we should living with each other .some want us to kill each other but that will never happen , I'm Muslim and I very happy with my Islam and have great love to all because that what prophet Muhamed Teach us , We are worship GOD of Moses and Jesus ."
1,defective DVD,The DVD was a blank. I tried it on several different formats.The movie is wonderful because I saw it on netflix and wanted to own it. I informed Amazon about this but they have not replied. I'd like a new DVD.
4,Good teaching film,"This is a very well done small-budget film about relationships between religions. It emphasizes the things the two have in common more than the differences.Schools might find it a useful film to use to explain cultural differences and similarities as it tells the story of two young women teachers, one Jewish Orthodox and one Muslim. The two young women find their differences are minor and their similar conservative attitudes make them bind together to deal with their own lives and their jobs helping their students learn. Both are being helped by their families in a search for the right husband and both have similar problems with choosing. Inter-cultural relationships among the men in their lives are also shown in passing as the brother of the Muslim girl is in a study-group at his university with a young Jewish Orthodox man.The film will probably appeal more to girls/women than to boys/men."
5,Beautifully simple,"The art of this movie is that it takes potentially heavy topics such as Jews and Muslims, but also feminism, and manages to stay away from overloading the film with conflict, morals and heavy, life-altering decisions - a trap that most film makers would walk right into if they took on these issues. Instead, 'Arranged' focuses on the every-day, the little things, and it does so credibly, with an endearing sense of humor and, above all, sensitivity towards its protagonists.It is not high drama, but it is deeply human, leaving the respective frameworks of these religious families intact while at the same time charmingly and convincingly working within them but also around them. I loved it."
3,Mostly entertaining,"A word of caution to balance all the raves I've read here. This is a fine little movie. The acting is mostly good. Mostly being the critical word. But the characters are one-dimensional. My viewing partner said her impression was that there was no character growth and she was right. I found it entertaining in a chick-flick kind of way. The only truly misguided part was the role of the headmistress or principal, who I guess was supposed to embody all of liberal societal prejudice. No educator in NYC would dare voice the types of complaints she does or be so insensitive. I can't even think why she would want to - what does a principal get from forcing assimilation on a teacher?"
1,Poor quality sound and segmenting of tracks,The CD has very poor sound quality to begin with. The tracks are not broken up into singular cadences.
1,Very lacking cadences,"I graduted Army Basic Combat Training in Nov 05. Charlie Battery, 1/79 FA, Fort Sill, OK.The cadence callers and responders are quite lacking on this CD. The cadences are old and the calling, quite frankly, sucks. The audio quality is poor as well.The production company really needs to coorindate with basic training company or battery and have their Drill Sergeants record some quality, motivating cadences. The cadences called at BCT are *far, far* better than this stuff."
5,Straight Path. Simple Truth.,"Presents Biblical evangelism in a simple, and easy to understand form. More than this, it is true Biblical evangelism.Phil Delre exudes the Lord.Buy this book, and get rid of the ""wonderful plan for your life"" rhetoric. God is not a means to an end, but the beginning and the end.This book can help you re-adjust your compass to the cross, where this becomes apparent."
4,Very Informative,This book is excellent for someone not knowing much about timber design and learning everything for the first time. Problems and information is presented in an easy to read and follow format which allows the reader to truly comprehend the material. This book is a great tool in developing the fundamental knowledge needed to design timber structures. I strongly recommend this book to anyone interested in the design of timber structures.
5,Design of Wood Structures - ASD,"After studying the book for six months, I think the material in the book is very good. I am disappointed, and surprised, that the binding is coming apart."
3,"Light on the mystery, but still enjoyable","I enjoyed a lot of things about this story, particularly the adoption subplot. Kellie Montgomery is an attractive heroine, and the scenes with her and her adopted daughter concerning the daughter's decision to search for her birth mother were very moving.The mystery itself is a bit light, but hopefully this will improve as the series progresses."
4,Small stainless cookie sheet is exactly what I was looking for!,"I was happy to find this item because I couldn't find stainless cookie sheets at any of the retail stores I patronize. No more obnoxious fumes from baking with non-stick pans. These cookie sheets work well for me because my oven is small, and the 12""x15"" size allows room around the sides for heat circulation. Because my old cookie sheets had higher edges all around, I had to adjust to gripping these cookie sheets tighter. As for the glue the manufacturer used to adhere the brand name/recipe page to the cookie sheet, I was successful using WD-40. I sprayed a bit of WD-40 on a paper towel, wiped the glue residue off and washed the cookie sheets before use."
5,Exceeded Expectations!,"Eliminating reactive metal cookware from our kitchen. Never had a stainless steel baking sheet before and now wish I'd been using them for years. Bakes evenly, distributes heat well, very easy clean up. Highly recommend this product."
5,"Even at 50 years of age, these will look great","A friend gave me three of her mother's stainless steel cookie sheets and I was looking to purchase a fourth. Boy, was I happy to find this! The three vintage stainless steel cookie sheets I inherited are probably around 50 years old, and look as good as this new one, which is exactly the same size and shape. When I received the older ones, all it took was a few minutes with a Brillo pad, and they were as shiny as new. I couldn't tell them apart from the new sheet. Of course, for those who don't want to expend a little elbow grease, a little oven cleaner does a great job, too.Stainless steel is easy to clean and lasts forever. It makes sense to purchase things that will last and last, and not need replacement every few years. I'm sure I'll be passing these onto my daughters for the next five decades of use."
3,Somewhat thin but cooks cookies,I don't have many other stainless pieces to compare it to. It's just barely thick enough to not bend very much. Cleans up very easily. Seems to cook cookies just fine.
3,Great cookie sheet!,I thought there was two in the purchase..but was disappointed to find out there was only 1. Good enough..but for the price.. should have been 2 to make it a great buy!
4,good pan,This is a good stainless steel cookie sheet. If it were a bit thicker / heavier it would get five stars. Good size; two will fit side by side in our oven.
2,Flimsy and smaller than listed size.,Don't believe Amazon's description that this is heavy-gauge. It is NOT. It's quite flimsy and smaller than the listed measurements.
5,Super Cookie Sheet,"I love it! Great size, does not stick. The teflon coated cookie sheets I have used seem to brown alot easier, and I don't need anymore help burning cookies. I am going to purchase a couple more of the stainless cookie sheets in the future."
2,Norpro 14 inch x 12 inch stainless steel cookie sheet,"I don't like the Norpro stainless steel cookie sheet. It's flimsy, cheap. I got what I paid for. I like stainless steel products but I'm learning that you really have to pay attention to the quality."
3,Only for Cookies,"I've had my pan for several years. It is not easy to clean. One of our first uses was for baked French toast. We pulled the pan out, the toast stuck and forever the outline of each shape remained on the pan, no matter how well we cleaned. Now it's old enough and the top has darkened so you can't see them.The other concern I have with this product is that if you need any oil or cooking spray, the cut-out corner and the edge that doesn't have a lip lets oil drip into your oven, which is a fire hazard. I'm puzzled why bakers believe that design improves air flow so greatly and improves cookies so much.I won't buy another because this pan isn't multi-functional enough but I will continue to use the one I have for cookies only (but don't serious cookie bakers reserve their cookie pans like that?)."
4,"great little pans, but a bit flimsy and definately warp in the oven","These pans are quite nice, and clean up well. I like them mainly because I'm very cautious about my cook/bake wear and stainless steal is a bit safer. They do always 'pop' or warp in the oven, which isn't necessarily a problem, though I would have preferred sturdier pans in that regard, but overall a good value for the price."
5,Comment,"My color is not at issue here, but I do happen to be white. I do not believe in reparations and I was prepared not to lie this book. However, I will say that after reading ""The Nickson View II"" I was surprized. There were some very good arguments. I highly recommend this book to All America."
3,Kylie!!!!!,"I love Kylie and have been a fan since The Locomotion. I have always seen as the-girl-next-door-type, fun-loving, good girl. I like the cutesy photos in this book but some of the photos of a sexual nature i didnt like. But they are nowhere near as bad as what was in [other] Sex book. THANK GOODNESS!!!! I guess that's just the prude in me though. Overall, it's a fun book with some great photos of her and neat packaging too."
5,great game !,"This is a great game because it gives you good sound and enemys. I beat this game in 5 days, but that was playing non-stop and I`m a pretty good gamer. My only hangup was the fourth level of the ghost place where you have to keep in sight of this ghost guy who never stops. A good story line and the last level is awesome. It's a cheap game money wise, but it has a great value and it's worth playing again."
5,"one of the best games that was made for the gameboy color. Also ""spoilers"" ""usefull game password""",This is one of the best platformer games that has ever been created. The game graphics are stunning and the controls and music are very good. This game is a rare treat and a must own. Hopefully in the future this game will be remade on to a console or another hand held system. Also here is a password that unlocks everything in the game very handy password to use if and when you get stuck on a certain level. The Password is gd8mbhs Good luck !!
5,uncle donald,in fact my son love donald and every day when he have a time heRead alawys about donald Really i think its great game and I wish to have a time to play this game too for feel my child age too.thank youbest regards
4,Good Start Point,"This book could be considered a first reading on Social science simulation.It's easy to read, has really good examples and most important has a lot of references to other books and tools.Do not set your expectations too high, it won't teach you how to build simulation, it just point out several different ways of doing it."
3,Decent toy,"I was so excited to bring this toy home for my daughter's bathtime pleasure. She did love it for certain, but I am a bit of a clean freak when it comes to the bathroom and this toy is hollow in the back and difficult to clean in all of its crevices. It built up slime. Also, made out of flimsy plastic-- the slide never stayed on... and the little animals are cute and colorful, but they are water squirts which is only good for a short while since they accumilate slime and then squirt out gunk as time goes on. very gross! cute and imaginative toy, but not clean or durable."
1,Won't stay stuck on the side of the tub,"I bought this for my 2 year old granddaughter. She loves the three small animals and puts them into the top hopper where you pour water to work the waterwheel and says it's a ""bathtub."" My biggest complaint is that it slides down the side of the tub the minute she trys to play with it and I am constantly pulling it up again."
3,one week and rusted,"my daughter received this toy for her first birthday. while she hasn't mastered all it's ""functions"" as of yet, she still really likes this toy. my biggest issue is that we have had it now for a week and the screws holding the pieces together are all ready rusted over... granted it is an inexpensive toy, but aluminum or some other rust resistant metal would have not been a costly alternative. she also received the Munchkin Baby Bath Turtles which work better for her on the slide. the plastic animals do not slide well, where as the round turtle slide perfect and are easy for her to maneuver. [...]"
3,Bien Hecho,"My theory is that if you own more than ten CDs,then one or two of them should be by Albita.On Hecho a Mano her unusual, entrancing voice isas good as ever. This is a more intimate, jazzysound than most of her previous work. The mix ofvoice and instruments allows her voice to comethrough clearly.All of the songs were written by Albita. This isa problem. The songs are good, but not great.Most of the songs, in one way or another, aresaying the same thing over and over again:""I want to love you. Let me love you."" This isfine, I guess, if you can pretend that Albita issinging to you. However, on this album she callsher lover a ""little woodland flower,"" which willprobably make it difficult for many men topretend that she is singing to them. Also, thiscontinual begging and pleading makes Albitaherself sound lonely and desperate.Fifty minutes of fun. The lyrics are included inthe album notes."
4,Great NES Classic,This is a really fun game by Hudson Soft. Nothing spectacular but it's still one of the best platformers for the console.
3,overall enjoyable,"This game is not that much different from the second game. The graphics are bright and colorful and very clear - much better than the first installment in this series. This game is not much different than its predecessor, you have the same constantly depleting health meter that needs continual eating of fruit to keep it up. You have the dinosaurs here again along with a new one. The levels and bosses are not much different than the second - the gameplay and weapons didn't go through that much modification. If you liked the previous games, you'll definitely like this one. You get to rescue your girlfriend... again. Yeah."
5,It ain't over 'til the thin lady sings!,"In this, her first English language video release, not only a younger, but also somewhat sexier (particularly in the song ""If There Was Any Other Way"") Celine performs many of her recordings from the early 90's. Unlike some of her subsequent video releases, which are either strictly concerts or music videos, this VHS tape is about half and half, and includes her first hit in English, ""Where Does My Heart Beat Now"", four other songs from the audio version of ""Unison"", and two others, including one in her native French (""Delivre-moi""). Also, by way of ""introducing"" her to the English language audience, a good part of this 45-minute tape is devoted to interviews with Ms. Dion, concerning her family, breaking in to the music business, recording in a studio as opposed to performing live, her superstitons, etc. The music is, of course, beautiful, and this video is highly recommended for all of Celine's many fans."
4,It's philosophical and complex,"Thought-provoking. It's not an ""easy"" read but well worth the effort if you appreciate children and their thinking. The writing is pretty complex and deep - which makes it a great book for ongoing reflection and discussion. This book offers understanding and insight into an alternative approach to educating young children. The high regard for children as thinkers, emphasis on professional collaboration, recognizion of different ""languages"" (modes?)for learning, attention to aesthetics and environmental factors, and genuine support for children and their parents to play an active role in education is defintiely refreshing."
4,An excellent book about the Reggio Emilia approach,"This was a very thorough discussion and analysis of the Reggio Emilia approach. It's basically a compilation of individual perspectives - of American and Italian views and explanations of the approach. If you want to learn more about Reggio Emilia, this is a good choice. It's just a bit lengthy at 488 pages. It's written in a simple style (except for one chapter by an American) so it's easy to read. Nice pictures throughout."
1,love the education profession,"I was not impressed with the 'Reggio Emilia' approach. Some of the 'hands on' parts don't make alot of sense. Some do, but the rest I was not truly taken by. In general, I feel this book could have done much better with the information which was true, but not used correctly. Just my opinion, I hope it does help with the educators out there, much like myself."
1,This Film Is Not Good At All,"This is the worst ""trendy"" American film I've seen since ""Rachel Getting Married."" Others who have given this one star have already said it all. After all the rave reviews by movie critics, I could not believe how amatuerish the whole thing was."
1,You can do better..actors?,The movie is a great movie but not for family...I repeat ..if you have any person who has morals who is a true religious person..This F_BOMB movie is not the one for you. I cannot understand why a great actor would settle for this low crap language when he is such a good box office draw.
1,Save your money,"I can't believe the rave reviews this movie is getting. There's nothing original about it, the plot actually makes little sense and Clooney looks like a fool. What are people thinking?"
1,Unwatchable,"I fell asleep about 1/3 of the way through. Story was bad, pacing was poor, characters not engaging nor believable. Not worth my time."
5,Big Surprise,I went into the theaters knowing nothing about this movie....what a pleasant surprise! Enjoyed every minute; a good ol' fashioned story!
4,Good but Sad,"This is an excellent movie adapted from a novel. It has life-like characters in believable real-life situations, but it is sad."
4,Good movie - realistic portrayal!!,"This movie was slow-moving at times, but overall a very REALISTIC portrayal of the emotions and actions during a serious tragedy. This was a very good movie & would recommend it. Good acting by George Clooney & the oldest daughter!"
4,Drama,"Drama. Beginning to think I have become so used to TV action, dialogue, that I have trouble taking the pace of a true drama. Liked this film. This drama. Predictable for sure but liked it anyway. Liked Clooney but Academy Award performance? Not in my mind. Certainly not a comedy or funny. Not despressing but could drag some souls down. Neither a recommend or no recommend."
4,Pleasant family drama,"While this is not a spectacular movie, it held my interest well, was well written, and well acted. The language was horrible, but that's a given with most Clooney movies. It's the story of how a family handles tragedies, triumphs, and life. The Hawaiian setting and intermittent Hawaiian music were nostalgic and delightful."
5,Fantastic,"This is a great movie, saw it in the theatre, acting was magnificent. Enjoyed it from beginning to end. Can definitely recommend it."
5,tender and funny,A tender and funny take on an unusual family tragedy (times two). Superb acting from all and beautiful scenery. Bring tissues and be prepared to laugh and cry.
4,A big hit for George Clooney,"It is a pleasure to add this movie to my personal collection so I can relax and watch it again whenever the mood strikes. It's a sweet story with a little humor, some emotion and wonderful Hawaiian scenery. The actors are perfect in their parts and the fact that they all enjoyed working together shows in their performances."
2,Wildly Overrated,"I think people got fooled by this film because it has good actors, a directors who has done some good work, and a strong opening of 15-20 minutes. But then it goes nowhere, does nothing, and resorts entirely to cliche. There is absolutely nothing here! If you'll be suckered into getting emotional about a character who has been comatose the entire movie, and whom we learn precious little about along the way, and if you enjoy the tritest ever speech about the natural beauty of Hawaii, then I guess you might get some pleasure in watching this melodrama. For the rest of you, my advice is please don't waste your time."
4,Great film,"This movie was: well acted, well paced and well restrained. It could have gone a number of easy directions but it controlled itself and it paid off. I don't recommend many films but hti is an easy call."
2,The Descendants DVD,I bought this on the recommendation of my cousin. I wish I had listened to my own instincts and saved the money.
4,Interesting Twist,George Clooney does not disappoint playing a wealthy family man who's family is falling apart over some key real estate in Hawaii that has to be sold. A twist in the plot makes him start wondering what is really important. Watch it and see what unfolds from there.
4,"A nice little family drama, but a real downer","This is not a happy film, and there is no Hollywood-esque upbeat ending. As such, this family tale is not likely to be a big hit. Clooney's intelligence in his choice of films is obvious, and this one is a cut above most Hollywood fare. It's a film about dysfunctional people. The mom spends the entire thing in a coma, looking more and more corpse-like. Great acting there! The kids are better than usual. Actually, the best thing here is the soundtrack of genuine Hawaiian music. I'm going to look into getting it. It is great."
3,Needed different characters to play Hawaiian descendants,"This was a great movie, my only complaint was they might as well had Irish people play Hawaiian descendants because Clooney no where resembles any Hawaiian blood, let a lone royalty. Not to mention his male family members that tried to get him to sell his land, including Beau Bridges, who looks no where near like his relative, let alone Hawaiian. As for the movie, it was awesome. Me being born and raised in Hawaii, thought the characters they chose where the wrong choice. I have many 'watered' down Hawaiian relatives with some being only a smidge Hawaiian, and they look full blooded still! Other than that, this movie had a wonderful story to tell, the emotions that took place, the hate, the love the mystery. Great story being told here."
2,The Descendants,I was disappointed in this movie. I expected more because of the rave reviews it received. Just a mediocre plot with a disfunctional family. I wouldn't recommend it.
3,clooneyless,"I like George Clooney but, like many of his movies this one tended to go slow and downright boring at times. Some movies can be viewed several times The Descendants not so much."
2,The descendants,"I receive this film and had to return it because it would not work on my t.V. The return process was excellent and I received another copy right away. This copy had some of the same problems as the other copy but I chose not to return it, and was able to watch it on an old t.v. set. Movie was good disappointed with product."
3,Slow Starter,A slow starter but gets better. It's worth watching but I would suggest spending less money and waiting until you can rent it.
2,The Descendants,"This movie was not at all what I expected, nothing like the previews and the trailers. I lost interest and was very bored not to mention there was a problem with the audio!"
3,"Good, but not great","Saw the previews for this one and rented it. I had been to Hawaii in 1992 and thought the photography in this movie was great. I liked the story line, too."
4,Good movie-good historical perspective,"The story was better than I expected. I liked looking at George Clooney, but I didn't think his acting was believable. I liked the story a great deal. Beautiful scenery for someone who has never been to Hawaii but would like to go."
3,Lightweight,It's a nice little film having the benefit of noteworthy actors starring in it. By no means Oscar worthy. George Clooney gave a better performance in `Up in the Air'.
3,JUST OK!!,I was all prepared to watch a great movie and dissappointed it became an OK movie. I found it to be depressing and kept waiting for it to pick up and something good would happen to the whole family.It never came and left me feeling sad.
3,Overwrought and overrated,"This movie is competently done, with all the requisite parts intact. The rebellious daughter, the cute daughter, the crusty father in law, the harried male protagonist trying to be a father for the first time. They're all in there.The script has all the right pieces in the right order. The storytelling uses voice-over, which I consider a weak device. I identified with all the characters without actually being able to get under their skin. It's a decent script but I wouldn't put it anything other than just slightly above average. I don't see how this script got the Oscar."
4,GOod flick,"It's a winner and a good movie. I don't like CLooney, but he does a good job in this flick."
4,"Good, however","Interesting premise. Turned it off when a ten year old is allowed to use words like ""c**t"", t**t"", and ""p**sy"" without being marched to the bathroom and introduced to a bar of Ivory soap. NOT A MOVIE TO WATCH WITH YOUR DAUGHTERS. Headed to the CD shredder."
3,Didn't hit the mark as a black comedy.,"I watched this movie under the impression that it was a comedy and on reflection it probably is a comedy - if you find that kind of thing funny.To be fair, there were times when I laughed - like when Clooney runs to his friend's house in flip flops or when the appalling kid gets a punch in the eye and I get that when people said awkward, painful things it was supposed to be humorous in a black way. But somehow it just missed the mark."
3,Pleasant Diversion,"A few friends have looked askance at me when I said I enjoyed The Descendants. Tough! I thought it provided an interesting slant on two painful topics: death and infidelity. Clooney underplayed the role (which, in my opinion, was better than hamming it up or trying to be funny), and the daughters seemed very authentic. I even cried a few tears for the all of them.Not a great movie, but a very pleasant diversion. What was great was being able to order the movie directly/immediately from Amazon from my Sony Google TV. I could get used to this!"
3,Engaging,This was an engaging and entertaining movie. It featured no violence or sex. It was very interesting to watch. More movies should be made this way..
4,Good movie...worth the time.,I liked this movie even after a bunch of people said it was sad and depressing. The plot is actually a great plot and although part of it is about the mom dying the rest of the movie is great.
2,Poor,"The acting and storyline were poor. The scenery, however, was fantastic! I spent most of the movie identifying the filming locations."
1,Don't waste your time,"Don't bother watching this movie. It's boring, depressing and has no point. clooney's performance was not very good. i dont see how the Academy saw anything impressive from his performance. I cant think of one good part in the movie. its really long and you keep hoping something interesting will happen and it doesnt the whole plot is his wife is in a coma and clooney finds out she was cheating on him. then she dies and they dump her ashes in the pacific. if you think that is a good plot then by all means rent it."
1,Worst I've seen in years,"This dud surprisingly got stellar reviews when I saw it in the cinema last winter. My expectations left me severely disappointed. The basic plot is depressing enough: the father of a disfunctional family visits his wife who's in a coma. Her infidelities come to light, which he confronts. In the end, she dies.The scenery in Hawaii is about the only good thing. Otherwise, don't waste your time."
2,Rented Twice,I gave this movie a two because I fell asleep during this movie on two occasions. I will probably not be renting it a third time.
2,"Overrated, and Not Much Fun","Dark film dealing with death and infidelity. Dad is out of touch with his children. Family bickering with a teenage girl being rude & ugly is not that fun to watch. Do people find this entertaining? Seemed slow and dull to me. Halfway through I wondered, ""What's the point? Is this leading anywhere?"" It seems aimless. This film does not measure up to other 2012 Oscar Best Picture nominees like The Help, Margin Call, Midnight in Paris, Moneyball, and War Horse. Those are all far better films. Skip this one, and watch one of those instead! Apparently, somebody connected to this film really knows how to play the Hollywood/Oscars politics game, to somehow get the awards this turkey generated. Not recommended."
1,The Descendants,DVD Excellent condition and service. Unusual story that keeps one on edge.Descendants CD is one of the most beautiful collections of Hawaiian music I've ever heard. The CD is in great shape and arrived early.
1,Much ado about nothing,"Sorry, cannot say I enjoyed this film. The good part is the acting and scenary, but the story is long and drawn out, and the plot is just silly. A wife lies in a coma, the daughter is at private rehab and of course turns from rebellious to compliant within 1 day. Her friend is quirky and doesn't work in the story. The father in law only shows his soft side behind closed doors (of course). The ""other man"" is tracked down so he can say goodbye (huh?). I don't know if they didn't miss the mark by simply concentrating on the immediate family dynamic and dropping the unncessary side stories including the best friends, the land trust (except Beau Bridges is part of that story and gotta love him), and the other man's family."
3,not much to see here,"this movie is just very average. the story seems a bit forced many times and it tries to twist a few emotions out of you but there is never really any depth or anything to feel a conviction about in the story. it feels like it's trying to push buttons from the formulas from other stories (wow, that was a mixed metaphor). the whole hawaii setting never felt like a good match to me either."
4,Movie,"This was a good movie, but it was a little to drawn out in parts. But yet a heart warming movie. George Clooney was pretty good in this move."
4,Fabulous Film!,This movie was nothing like what I was expecting. It was SO good and told such a great story about the Hawaiian Islands and the people who have land there that should never be used for commercial use. The unspoiled beauty of the land was beyond wonderful. George Clooney was great as a father who didn't know his daughters and became the father he was supposed to be for them.
2,Disappointing,"Not a comedy as portrayed. A sad and depressing slice of life, especially for those who have lost a loved one. The acting was okay; but not worth spending the money to see it in the theater, which I did. Unfortunately."
3,The Descendants,"While I have never had the opportunity to visit the Island, I found the photography to be wonderful. However, this movie drags forever in some places...good acting, I suppose, but BORING!"
3,movie rating,"i thought the plot moved along slow, reaction to the premus unrealistic. we really don't get to know the character this movie is about. not georges best effort"
4,Jerry's review,"Great movie. I saw it in the theater, and I wanted to add it to my DVD library. I have other movies by the same director."
4,The Descendants,"It's a very good movie,very interesting to watch. Story line and dialogue are well written. It's not a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat but it is touching. The characters are nicely developed. George Clooney give a great performance as does the rest of the cast. Great addition to my movie collection."
1,Worst movie I have seen in a long time,"I hate to give anything with George Clooney in it a 1 star review, but I watched this thing after paying for it on Dish because it had a high rating. This is a pathetic excuse for a movie. The title is deceiving. Yes, there are Hawaiian descendants in it, for a total of about 3 or 4 min. The whole movie centers around George Clooney's dying wife and her affair with a realtor, which George and his daughter set out to find. Four letter words coming from the mouths of a ten year old and her teen age sister abound and are not my idea of pleasant viewing, either. The characters are shallow and uninteresting. Very boring. The whole movie you keep on waiting for something interesting to happen and it never does. Don't waste your time on this one."
3,"Interesting, but sad","Plot line was good, but topic was a bit macabre. The film was definitely worth watching, but glad I didn't buy it."
4,George Clooney running...,"George Clooney running in boat shoes makes me chuckle just thinking about it. Very good movie, plays with all your emotions."
3,Okay,"I mean that is all i can say about it. I see that it is on the premium channels of direct tv, but i will not watch it again."
4,Great film,Clooney at his best. Good story of the loss of a mom and wife and the revelations that come through dealing with the end.
1,Disappointing . . .,"After hearing a friend rave on and on about this movie, I rented it (thank goodness it was only a $2 rental).The best part of the movie was the scenery; everything else was lacking: plot/script/acting, and most of all the irritating Hawaiian music sung by some guy who needs to keep his day job.To have this movie nominated for Best Picture validates that today's movies are worse than ever."
1,Big Time Suck!,"OMG! Listed as a comedy! We struggled through it. It was the most depressing and boring movie I have ever seen! The Woman in the movie wasn't the only person in a coma, we were too after we watched this horrible movie!"
3,Great Movie,"George Clooney, exquisite, sexy, and interesting. Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah; Blah"
4,I love this movie,"so does my mopm, who bought this copy for her sister's birthday. However, one star removed because my husband hates it. However, he hates all chick flicks'"
1,What a stinker!,"Very slow moving. Very predictable. Wealthy family in Hawaii with jaded and spoiled kids, beautiful homes overlooking the ocean, etc. Terrible acting.Final catch (I won't spoil it) is basically a denouement. I fail to see how Clooney got nominated for this."
1,The Decendants,"Confusing story line and poorly acted by all participants, would not recommend the flick for anyone because of the totally dysfunctional behavior depicted."
1,Disappointed !!!,"I really wanted to like this movie. Sat down with my family to have an enjoyable evening watching a movie. The movie started out bad and got worse from there! First, I was SHOCKED AT SOOOOO MUCH FOUL LANGUAGE !!! It was completely UNNECESSARY!! Didn't help the movie at all. Second, very depressing film. Guess it could be viewed as close to real life in a depressing situation. Movie started with this attorney who hadn't been home to spend time with his family. Daughters didn't even know him. Lots of teen attitude. I do have to say that in this downer of a movie there is the boyfriend Sid ( comes across a loser, but actually has some deep thoughts). He has some great lines and he is what I enjoyed the most. My husband and I were laughing about how the actress who played the wife had the best part. She got to play comatose the whole movie! OH to get paid to nap! I would not watch this movie again and I will be giving away the DVD."
1,comedy? really?,"This is the most depressing movie I may have ever seen! my family was in a good mood before we watched this movie; after i thought about setting up a suicide watch for us all. Don't watch this movie, save yourselves!"
1,Magnum..er Clooney P.I,"The film starts off by copying Magnum PI where George Clooney is narrating his life outloud. Foul foul language. ""F"" words everywhere. Disrespectful kids. The wife is in a coma. Yelling swear words at dying wife whos in a coma. Clooney's charactor stocks his comatosed wife lover with kids in tow only to confront the guy with foul swear words in front of his teenage daughter. The younger daughter is shuffled off constantly to get out the room. There was mean mean slams at retarded and elseimer people as well as the elderly. It was very depressing movie and I fast forwarded alot of it. I didn't understand why George said he wanted to divorce his wife in a coma and then the ending he is all crying and kissing his wife's chapped lips? The wife looked really gross...like an open coffin funeral. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie. I want to watch something uplifting now to get my mind off this movie.....hmmm Fred Astaire?"
1,Waste of money,I thought this movie was going to have some substance but it lacked this plus a lot more. Glad I only paid $1 at the maxisaver movie theater.
1,The dvd is defective.,"This dvd is defective. The second half of the movie has a ton of frozen moments which was very distracting. Didn't enjoy watching the movie at all. PLEASE REPLACE, and let me know what to do with this one. If you send me a paid return envelope and I will be happy to send it back. Please advise what to do."
1,zero rating,We never got to watch the movie as it was deleted from my Kindle before I could watch it. There should be more than a 24 hour window!!
2,"Not Funny, Slow and Mostly Pointless","I am family man, Cloney's age, and a few folks say I even might even resemble George, but even I could not identify with him in this movie. I was hoping for something funny and quirky (Brother Where Art Thou?). Not even close, like watching paint dry. Everything funny is in the trailer."
1,"Depressing, unfunny, uninteresting","Rarely walk out of movies, but this one we couldn't finish. None of the characters were likable in the slightest bit. It wasn't funny, it wasn't that dramatic, not sure what else to say.Many of my friends did like this movie though, so judge for yourself but be prepared to love it or hate it."
3,"It's all right, but ...","... but hardly in a league with Payne's previous three films -- Election, About Schmidt and Sideways -- and I have to wonder whether the seven-year layoff threw the director off his stride. While The Descendants features a reliable performance by Clooney (albeit what has become a fairly standard Clooney performance), a creeping stiffness occasionally overtakes the script and the characters seem a bit cliched (i.e. precocious younger and angry older daughter, idiot boyfriend, grumpy father-in-law). In the past, Payne so worked over his cliches that they were no longer cliches; he mined their essential reality and revealed them to us in ways that seemed new. This time, working with two new writing partners, he doesn't and his movie seems facile (notably the coincidence at its heart), scenic and mainstream rather than personal."
2,Somber look at a dysfunctional family,"When Matt King (George Clooney)'s wife goes into a coma, he realizes how distant he was from her and from his two daughters. Then he learns his wife was cheating on him.George Clooney plays against type as a clueless father and husband with baggy eyes and a beaten-down face. He slouches through the story and generally looks pretty ordinary. He's good in the role, but not good enough to save the movie. My first problem with it is the constant profanity used by the two young daughters; it's off-putting, to say the least. Second, the story is a real downer, dealing with death, infidelity, and family struggles. Third, it's relentlessly tedious, so monotonously depressing that it gets old fast. And lastly, I didn't like or care about any of the characters.The Hawaiian scenery is beautiful and it represents unvarnished reality, but it's just not my idea of entertainment."
5,I like ordering move's,"from Amazon. When I have to wait along time some place, I can alway's watch my movie. Sure make's the time go by faster.Beside's it 's cheaper than going to the movies......"
2,Watchable........,"It was OK. Was hoping for more edge coming from the directorof the superb ""Sideways."" George Gooney as a man with commitments was more than I could believe. I mean, the guy changes girlfriends as often as his underwear. I wasn't buying him as husband/father for one minute. Nasty, nasty language out of the mouths of babes. And with this thing blaring in your house for kids to hear, we wonder why they talk so filthy. Robert Forster could have been good, seemed to have phoned his performance in. This one didn't have any strong scenes, just kind of limped along to the end.On the plus side the scenery was nice."
4,Descendants,"Well acted, good story, but the theme is a bit of a downer and you have to understand that when you watch this movie."
4,Memorable film with Clooney at his best,"I had missed this highly rated (by the critics) movie in theaters, so I finally got around to renting the Blu-ray over the weekend.It's mostly a sad drama about a man slowly losing his wife after a boating accident, but there are a few comedic moments along the way that are realistic, rather than forced. The writing and the entire cast are great. I'm not the biggest George Clooney fan, but his work in Up in the Air and The Descendants has totally made me a believer in his acting talents when given the right material. The girl who plays his oldest daughter is very good as well. One of the better movies I've seen in 2012 and worth checking out."
3,Enjoyed the acting,"Wonderful acting but fairly heavy drama...There is a bit of humor here and there but if you are looking for light-heartedness, this is not the place."
4,Not what I expected,Did not know what this story was about when I purchased it and was pleasantly surprised by the storyline. It was enjoyable and the kind of movie I would watch again.
3,Good drama,George clooney definatly carries this movie. Overall its a good movie to fill some time if your looking for a Drama
1,This Won the Academy Award for Best Picture?,"Apart from the good acting, good direction and tight, fluent script, this is not much of a movie. It is eye-candy, and not in the least compelling. Unremarkable descendents of 19th century white missionaries to Hawaii who are now, after several generations, filthy rich from doing nothing more than capitalizing on vast inherited land holdings, yet have problems like everyone else, does not make for a gripping story. Instead, it is a rather revolting one."
4,"A Good Film, But.................","Yes, it is a very well-made film with a good story, strong cast and production value.Yes, it may be George Clooney's best performance in a film so far.But............. this film does not stay with you.Would this be enough for the Best Picture Oscar?"
5,If you love Hawaii you love ethis film.,"the Descendants is just a fantastic movie about family relationships. I enjoyed the independence of the teenage daughter. I thought the family really came alive and the father #finally got it# by the end of the movie. GThe scenery was beautiful. The ocean was such a beautiful color. The greenery was so lush, just like Hawaii."
1,Sooo slow,"This was a really boring, depressing and slow movie. I stopped watching close to the ending. Very depressing. A friend of mine was the husband of the couple he was friends with, which kept me watching as long as I did."
1,I don't understand why this one was nominated...,"...for so many awards? I went to see it in the theater with two others. We were all expecting to see a good movie but were really disappointed. After about 1hr into the movie, I just wanted to slit my wrists because it really is a depressing movie. Boo."
1,I can't believe I bought this movie.,"Where is the ""hilarity?"" Where is the "" funny ?"" This is the worst movie I have ever seen! - and it was nominated for 5 Academy Awards! The critics must have been drunk or they never saw the movie. It reverses comedy and tragedy. A really horrible, depressing movie about a dysfunctional family."
2,Sad and depressing,"I'll keep it short also. Although I am a big Clooney fan, I did not like this movie.It starts out with a reality check about Hawaii: traffic jams, cancer, etc. Not my view of Hawaii and probably not one promoted by the Hawaiian tourist bureau, but most likely the view experienced by the locals. The movie goes down hill from there. Clooney's family is dysfunctional. His wife is dying and dies. She has cheated on him while living. His daughters are foul mouthed and have their own issues. His larger tribal family is trying to sell their pristine ancestral family land to developers to make some money, actually a fortune.I felt sad and depressed after watching this. It was certainly not an uplifting flick."
2,The Despondents,"The best rating I can give this movie is a Good God.If the theme music hadn't been so inappropriately jaunty, if the themes hadn't been so schizophrenic, if the characters had been more believable and sympathetic, if the plot had been coherent, if the film as a whole had a notion of where it was going, if the alky/druggy teenaged daughter hadn't made such a dizzying leap into mental health, if George Clooney's eyeliner had been more subtly applied -- then this might have turned out to be a halfway creditable effort. But noooooo.As it was, this movie resembled a bunch of trailers jammed together under a common title, all starring the same basic troupe of actors who had read the script months before and promptly forgotten the plot. The director/producer/scriptwriter had conflicting ideas of what they wanted. Not one of the lot seemed to really understand the grinding sadness of the situation. It warranted a treatment much like that given IRONWEED but got anything but."
2,regular,"Already saw the movie. Do not want to buy it since it was not interesting for me and it's not the kind of movie I would like to see again. I like George Clooney, but I don't think this was the type of movie he would perform in."
3,Just okay....,"I was sadly disappointed in 'The Descendants' after all I'd heard and read about how wonderful it was and that it is George Clooney's finest acting to date. I frankly just do not agree. The film was ho-hum, the acting okay but nothing special. The storyline reminiscent of many other stories I've seen and read. I feel it could have been so much more if they hadn't tried to make the entire story mainly about the fact the dying mother had an affair--was the sum total of everyone's existence? I doubt it.Guess I'm glad I watched it yet wish I'd waited til this one was on the free list rather than wasting $3.99 on it."
2,"WEIRD STORY LINE, and DVD FORMAT!",If I had known what this movie was actually about I doubt if I would have purchased it - weird movie for Clooney. I didn't do my home work enuf. and didn't really like it at all. It wouldn't play on my 'everyday' DVD player so had to find one it WOULD play on - a real pain!
2,Terrible Video Transfer,"By the time you get to the end of ""Fists of Fury"" you will want to hurl your remote through the TV... not because of the terrible VO (which it is) and not because of the bad 70's clothing... but because the video transfer on this is so bad that by the end of the movie you will be checking your DVD player for a ""Tracking"" button. Large scratches across the film, dirt, and huge white lines that will remind you of the rabbit ears on an old TV going out of whack.The movies themselves, well you either love old Kung Fu films or you dont... but if you love them, do yourself a favor and get a better copy than what is available on these DVDs."
2,Essential?--Not Hardly,"I bought this CD hoping to find at least a few good tunes, ones I didn't recognize from the track listing, but I was disappointed. There are great artists on this 4 CD set, and the technical sound quality is great, but there are no undiscovered gems, to my musical taste anyway. Calling them ""64 Legendary performances"" is textbook marketing hyperbole, as any knowledgeable bluegrass fan can tell by looking at the track listings. I only ripped a couple tracks onto my MusicMatch jukebox, just to avoid it being a complete waste. Buy Flatt & Scruggs ""Carnegie Hall Concert"". If you don't like that, you will never like bluegrass."
3,Essential-not exactly,"There is some enjoyable music on this collection, but I was suprised at some of the selections. Some of the songs on this collection are not bluegrass. For example, track 12 on CD 3 ""Love Gonna Get You"" sounds more like sixties country rock/boogie. How it ever made it on this collection of essential bluegrass is beyond me. Unfortunately, it is not the only song on this collection that is not bluegrass."
3,Picture and description is misleading!,"I bought one of these recently thinking that I would get what is in the picture and description... NOT SO!! You ONLY get the sine bar in a cardboard box. No ""shop hardened case"", No 18 risers.That said... The B&S; sine bar is a well made and well finished precision tool. I checked it on my granite surface plate using a Compac 215A test indicator (0.0001 in) and, according to my indicator, the sine bar was dead-nuts parallel. The instrument does what I need it to do.It would have been a fantastic deal if it came with all the risers and the case. It is an OK deal as just the sine bar. That is why I gave it only three stars."
3,A decent buy for Alan Davis fans,"I bought this book because I am a huge fan of Alan Davis from his work on Excalibur. The art is, on the whole, quite good, and the writing is... well the writing is Claremont. I am no fan of Chris Claremont but his ideas here are often fun, and his dialogue/interior monologues are no clunkier than usual. The stories contained here are pretty disjointed, particularly the single issues of X-men. The material in the annuals is well complemented by the X-Men Visionaries: Art Adams trade, and readers who want more back story on Psylocke will need to check out the out-of-print Alan Davis/Jamie Delano Captain Britain Trade. Not a stellar book by any means, but there are worse ways to spend 20 bucks."
5,Great Product!,Mcoll's pig shed is an excellent toy. It comes with a little wooden pig and when a train passes over the red sensor it makes an oinking noise for the pig or you can push the red button on top and it makes the same oinking noise. Very educational in teaching a young child about farm animals and sounds they make.
4,it's ok,for the price. small and average materials. about all you would expect for the money. it should serve nicely as a primary skinner until i invest in a high quality one.
4,Really fun game,I ordered this game and it came faster than i expected. i couldnt wait to use the original vaus(dial controller) for the game but it didnt work..it just glitched around on screen..SO i just gave up using the vaus and im happy that it works with a normal controller. the game itself is difficult i cant get past the 1st level. but i still like it and play it every once in a while.
4,Funky old school,"I wonder how many people actually have ever heard of this game? :)The arcade version's controller was this spinning button you had to use to move the platform that would bounce the ball upward to destroy the colored cubes to move to the next level. I've played the arcade version and on the NES with a standard controller, and I must say, using a standard controller is easier. There's no villains or mighty heroes or anything like that - just a good, old fashioned puzzle/action challenge that tests your reflexes and is a great way to pass the time."
3,An original game with no addictiveness,"The game is original in a sense, and is a building block of sorts that other games have used in their own gameplay idea. The bottom line is, however, that the game lacks that familiar addictability that many NES games possessed. Arkanoid is a fun game, but lacked that little something extra to make it a cult classic."
2,only if you like jazz,"not a typical Eric Clapton, he just was used for the name, mostly other jazz players"
3,Excellent Clapton burdened by 80s keyboards & material,"Eric Clapton was in fine voice and his guitar-playing was top-notch as always in this concert from 1986. Unfortunately, there were also some factors that really detracted from my enjoyment of the performance. First of all, I hated the electric keyboards of Greg Phillinganes. That noodling, mellotron sound, which was so popular in this 80s, is featured far too prominently in the mix to the extent that he even has several solos. In addition, there is a giant dead spot in the middle of the show when Clapton performs several songs that were then new but which have not stood the test of time. They are just not very good. The song that Phillinganes leads with bassist Nathan East is simply awful. A surprise highlight comes when Phil Collins leads the band in a performance of his classic ""In the Air Tonight,"" one of the few songs from his solo work that I care for."
4,clapton as we know him,"i wanted this dvd in spite of the fact that phil collins was part of it as i didn't want a co-concert. but it turned out fine as phil was just part of the band and only took center stage, so to speak, in a small way. as to the concert itself, eric chose his support group well with greg phillinganes on keys and nathan east on bass - two of my personal favorites.it is almost impossible not to be magical with nathan east on bass. the only complaint i can possibly have is all the songs i wish he had performed but, if he did, they weren't part of this concert. eric was clearly feeding off the crowd's excitement. "" wonderful tonight"" is absent but that's okay."
1,Surely an Infomercial or Blatently Obvious - Don't Buy This,"There are books out there which stimulate the mind or offer readers fresh ways of looking at the world and their money. This book does none of this. Please...run, don't walk...to another Amazon selection if you have any clue at all about organizing your finances. Ruff misuses financial dffinitions and glorifies the obvious. ""The magic of compounding!"" Wow... I'll bet you never heard that one before. He interchanges the terms ""one year investment return"" with ""yield,"" which is a dangerous thing. Just because a mutual fund returned 22.7% in 2003 it does not mean that that return expectation is available today here ann now. Don't ask him to explain mean-reversion of returns, because that gets in the way of his weak quasi-thesis. Complete garbage.I promise - if you had a chance to thumb through this book before buying it, you would never shell out a penny for it.Feeling like an idiot for adding it to my cart..."
1,don't waste your money!!!,"I'm less polite than the other reviewers. This is, pure and simple, an infomercial for his newletter, has little to no information, and you would violate sound use of your resources just buying it. Stay away!!!Say, Amazon -- why can't we give, ""STUNK ON ICE"" ratings?"
1,The Author is Double-Jointed,"He has to be since he spends so much time patting himself on the back. This is a bad book, pure and simple. The author spends an inordinate amount of time talking about his history of losing money and making money. But the stories aren't in great detail and come off as braggadocio. In addition, his advice is minimal and simple. He goes through the time value of money and how yields on small amounts of money invested for many years will allow you to retire well off but doesn't really give creditable advice on retiring really rich, other than buying his newsletter.I cannot emphasize enough how bad this book is. Only two other times have I not read a book I started in its entirety. Here's number three. I read the first half and scanned the last half. I assure there was no improvement. Take a pass on this turkey."
1,"Good on cover, but useless inside","I was intrigued by the tile of this book and still like the concept of the two different paths to wealth; however, the book offers nothing useful that it already in a million other personal finance books.The author does go through a three page bulletted list of his personal accomplishments (including taking down the Soviet Union). He honestly put in his book that he was responsible for taking down the Soviet Union, and here I thought it was internal economic problems combined with pressure from Reagan.His ultra-conservative views are also quite offensive to most people. His advice: get married regardless of your situation, and for females, be sure to be home when your kids grow up.About the only thing I learned from this book is that Mormons keep a 6 month supply of food on hand at all times.This book is horrible, don't buy it."
2,Some good insights but the author tries to impose his views,"The book contains some useful, common sense advise about managing one's finincial affairs and saving. I like that the author suggests two options for achieving financial independence, one for risk averse people and another for risk seeking ones.However, the author tries to impose his views about personal life to the reader. For example, he urges readers who are not married to do so as soon as possible regardless of the readers' personal preferences. This becomes quite annoying.I also noted that the author takes a very negative view of social securing. Most working Americans have to rely heavily on social security and medicaid to get by during retirement. Being so negative does not help the reader."
4,"Great book, don't be put off by cover art","The cover art on this book is just awful. Guy looks like a fop (polite wording), and he is nothing like that. This is an enjoyable tale with great characters. Read the Warlord as well, preferably first."
2,nancy's passion,I did not enjoy either movie - poor acting and story - the 2 star was no reflection on the company - they were very efficient - quick delivery and excellent condition.
1,Disappointed,"I bought this book because I saw the exhibit at the Musee Maillot in Paris in 2005 and stupidly didn't buy their book of the drawings as I thought I could buy it here it here in the US. (Which isn't possible). This is an extremely disappointing pick of very few of his drawings, all of which were certainly not my favorites. There were so many which better demonstrated his skill in catching the expression, the sexuality and the beauty in very few lines I am surprised at all the inclusions and the exclusions. In my mind he picked the weaker drawings. And yes, they didn't even catch an obvious drawing inserted upside down, which unfortunately states a lot since there are so few of them."
5,Excellent product,This was just as advertized. The strainer screen in the neck of the funnel was just what I needed for the job I bought it for.
2,"The Wrong Version of ""Christine""","I'm surprised the other reviewers didn't mention it... but this Aussie compilation has a different, slow version of ""Christine"" -- not the upbeat gem that appeared on the American version of Escape Artist. Since the fast version of ""Christine"" is one of my favorite Garland Jeffreys songs, I was very disappointed with this collection. I'll buy Escape Artist on CD and listen to my vinyl until they release a U.S. ""best of"" collection."
3,Interesting...,"...but not for those expecting a 2012 3D presentation. While the content is well thought out and intelligent, it's at the forefront of 3D imagery. With the exception of the 'title' screen, you must train your eye interactively to appreciate the 3D presentation. No big deal? It takes some repeated effort to refocus each time you look away from the imagery. Not what you're probably used to, like me! So be prepared for an extremely interesting documentary and a first gen 3D experience."
1,Unwatchable,"If I could give this zero stars, I would. I purchased this anticipating a 3D view of Mars from multiple perspectives. What I received was a collection of images whose 3D effect was so grossly shifted as to be unwatchable. After about 10-15 minutes of attempting to watch it, I gave up as my eyes were watering heavily.This is NOT a DVD that I would recommend to anyone."
5,Fantastic!,"Mars in 3D is a great film about the martian planet. It contains images taken by Viking I and II. Its a great example of a restoration done by a team of people who generally are interested in the space program and have a deep respect for it. It is great to see these images come to life after 30+ years. The soundtrack is incredible to boot. It has the original music composed for the film but it is in 5.1 surround now and sounds breath taking in your home theater. This is highly recommended for people interested in space, 3D imagery, and electronic music alike!"
3,A fighting game with lousy fighting controls,"the graphics and music for this game are pretty good for the time it came out. The controls when jumping are fairly good. However, the problem is with the fighting controls. Your enemies move faster than you, which means when you have an enemy on opposite sides of you, you can't take them both out without getting hit. You have to take the hit from one side until the enemy passes you and then you can hit him. The controls are sluggish. You will spend more time fighting the controls than you will the enemies in the game.You also need a weapon to defeat the bosses, otherwise you will die. If this game had the controls of 'Kung-Fu' this would have been a good game. As it stands, it's just ok. There's worse and there's better."
2,Bad Dudes... try Bad Game,"...Bad Dudes is a lack luster game. Once you beat it, it goes out of rotation and eventually gets traded in. I would not suggest this to anyone. I would prefer Double Dragon, River City Ransom or even the TMNT Arcade Game before this one. Don't waste your time or money."
3,Oscar on automatic,"I am a huge fan of Oscar Peterson, but this is really a very average Peterson album. Don't get me wrong the trio are fine and the playing is as good as you would expect. The problem is the lack of variation. Most of the tunes are played mid-tempo and Oscar never really stretches himself. The only semi-uptempo number is ""It happened in Monterey"".Out of 12 tracks only 5 are longer than 3 minutes and none are longer than 4. Indeed one is less than 2 minutes. So I'm afriad this means you get a theme statement short solo and theme again on nearly all tracks.There is nothing wrong this album, but there are literally dozens of better Oscar Peterson albums to get first."
3,Fair; 3.5 stars,"Like other books by McCarthy, has some interesting ideas and plenty of action. The book has an epic scope and feel, and one does come to emphasize with the embattled protagonist.But not an excellent book. Adequate entertainment. I thought it was significantly better than Murder in the Solid State, and perhaps slightly worse than Bloom. Good enough so that you are willing to read more books by McCarthy.I have not read Aggressor 6."
1,Battery does not hold a charge,"Sadly, I bought two of these. They don't hold a charge. The old one I had in my phone works better. Hard to believe that this was 'new'"
5,Love it on my pc,"I have a pair of Bose Mediamate desktop speakers which are over 5 yrs old and still sound as great as when I first got it, but now that I added this subwoofer, it feels as though my music has come to life. The base that comes out of these is floor-shaking. Don't get me wrong, the bose speakers alone have enough bass to almost drown out the subwoofer if I have the sub volume too low. I have to turn up the sub volume a bit to at least hear the difference. All in all, for $99, this is a steal. It's great for any home theater setup and is a great add-on for anyone who only has desktop speakers and feel they need the extra bass on their pc."
3,It's one of those games,"where, if you know the cheat codes or have a game genie, it can be a great lot of fun, but if not, you'd best be a kung fu master or eight year old child to have the speed and dexterity required to make it past the third map."
4,excellent for the lay person,"I recently checked this book out from the library, and now I must have a copy of my own. I have recently started raising show pigs, and believe me this book will help alot. I have already learned some neat things, and look forward to learning more."
5,Love this book,I had a copy of this book some time back. I let someone borrow it & it was never returned. I finally found a copy here. Everyone that has a Hobby or small farm needs a copy of this book. A lot of common problems are described along with treatment. It's a great 'how to' book. This does not mean it cuts the vet completely out but it does of the picture--but it does save greatly on vet bills. The book was used but in really good shape. Big plus-someone wrote notes in the margin!
1,Unexciting plot and flawed relationship,"I just wasn't that impressed with this and it didn't really capture my interest/excitement. It annoyed me how one minute Todd and Barney *could she have chosen uglier names?* were on the same page and the next minute they were isolated, like they went back and forth a lot. Their relationship also seemed really flawed, since they wouldn't talk about things or be honest and open with each other."
1,No,"Brindle is dying, and not just because that's the trend with small towns. A killer is slowly decimating the population. Perhaps the deaths could be written off as disappearances, but one reporter, Todd Fielding, comes to town and won't let the truth be silent. She is determined to get a the real story, no matter the cost.* If you could judge a book by the cover, this would be outstanding. The artwork is stunningly lovely. However, the characters fail to engage and the purported suspense simply is not there. *Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
1,Not worth the money,"I am a facilitator for a substance group and thought this film would be something I could use in the group. I was very disappointed, it is so outdated and of no use to me at all. I do not recommend it.Jerri Barrett"
3,+1/2 -- Lo-fi Montreal garage-punk supergroup,"Formed by former members of the Montreal bands Del-Gators, Sexareenos and Spacesh**s, this quartet unleashes a similar brand of lo-fi garage punk rock. Those familiar with bands like The Hives and White Stripes may be surprised by the sloppy, raw and loose nature of these recordings, and while the antecedents may include '50s rock 'n' roll and DIY '60s garage-psych, at this late date the aesthetic is more reactionary (in a '77 punk vein) than inventive. Highlights include the thickly mixed freakout, ""Mindmelt"" with its trippy organ and scorching guitars, and the surprisingly catchy (given its title, anyway) singalong, ""Lecherous Parasite."" In the end, the lack of something new doesn't dim the energy of this ragged, loud and fun rock 'n' roll. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings. [2006 hyperbolium dot com]"
1,Very Basic - Not Worth The Time,"I was looking for a book that gives a intro tutorial on creating machinima, but this book is so basic that it fails even at that basic expectation. It has nice glossy pictures, but most topics of serious interest (e.g., copyright, setup, distribution, etc.) are nothing more than 1-2 pages, with half of each page space dedicated to pictures. I flipped through this book literally in 3 mins, looking for one reason to keep it but to no avail. It's going back to Amazon. I don't want to sound mean, but I want to share my views so that others don't waste their time ordering and returning this."
1,human anatomy,"The book was lost in the mail. I, however, received a full refund on my purchase. I did receive the atlas that went with it."
3,Meh.,"When I bought this, it was to quell my wife's nausea onset by hyperemisis. The smell is faint. It was hardly worth the purchase. Those peppermint towelettes, though, BAM! Those are a lot of mint in a small package. Go for those instead."
1,Terrible,"I purchased these thinking that they were the same product I had purchased before due to the material looking familiar. Don't be fooled, this pack must be stuffed with styrofoam as it doesn't retain the cold, and there is a sticker on it that states DO NOT MICROWAVE. It does have the peppermint smell, that's about nicest thing I can say about this product."
