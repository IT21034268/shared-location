3,Good Offering But ...,"The ""Have A Nice Day-Super Hits Of The Seventies"" series put out by Rhino is a decent collection of 70's pop tunes and hard to find singles .. that's where it ends however.Most of the songs are certified hits but quite a few are either ""filler"" , ""wannabe's"" or ""obscure"".The biggest complaint however is how ""CHEAP"" Rhino got by only putting ""12"" songs on each disc ! HELLO ? This is the year 2000 not 1970 ! In case Rhino doesn't realize , you can get almost ""80"" minutes on a CD today ! But then of course they could not RIP YOU OFF and it would have shrunk their profit margin.The sound is great and some of the material has appeared on CD for the first time but nevertheless a disappointment - If Rhino had used the space on the discs more wisely I would have given this a 5 star rating - This goes for the entire series not just volumes 1-4 ..."
5,Great game.,"Before my recent purchase of this game, the last time I played Winning Run was about 10 years ago. 10 years ago I remember scoring on average 10 runs per game. This time however I'm lucky to only score 3.I don't know if the game was always this difficult or if my skills have diminished. However difficult, this game is still a ton of fun.I like that this is a classic arcade style baseball game instead of the sims popular today. It's easy to pick up and learn but difficult to master.Homerun derby is still my favorite mode after all these years."
2,"This is definitely not ""olive""","Overall, this was a nice storage ottoman at a really decent price. However, I had to send it back because it is definitely NOT olive in color. When I opened the box, I was very surprised to find that it is actually a very bright lime green -- the kind of lime green appropriate for a clown car, not a living room. Amazon was great about accepting the return and giving me a refund, and it was very quick and easy to get it returned. Although, they really ought to update the product listing for this one, as the color is not true to life on the listing either."
4,Some great music here,Had the pleasure of attending the opening night of the La Guitara tour at Wolf Trap last nite. Went in the door not knowing any of these guitarists and came out still amazed at the jaw-dropping technique and tone of Mimi Fox. Patty Larkin and Muriel Anderson were also on the bill (Kaki King was ill and didn't perform). Bought this CD on the way out the door and have been listening to it all afternoon. Recommended as a great collection of different guitarists--only incidentally important (to me anyway) that they're all women. Recommended.
4,Good - deep * soul * house *,"Classically good deep soul and house. Enjoyed every beat of it, although if you are looking for ""new"" sounds or what you think should be ""new"" sounds, this is not the album, but its good all the way."
2,Read Carefully Before Buying,Read this carefully before buying! It's for FILM slr cameras or possibly dslrs that have been IR converted internally. This is NOT an infra-red filter for the lens on a dslr camera :(The seller however was excellent - fast shipping (2-day) and safe packaging.
5,Very detailed and easy to follow book!!,"Awesome book on Native hawaiian plants. Very easy to follow intructions for propagation, germination, and outplanting."
1,"A very fine mystery, but not a thriller","I'd love to review this book, as requested by Amazon.com. However, It is still somewhere on a ship, enjoying a leisurely cruise to my island home in Hawaii. For some unfathomable reason Amazon decided to ship it ""parcel post,"" without informing me in advance. Soooooooo, I still haven't received the book, ordered more than two weeks ago, and probably won't receive it ""until my ship comes in."" Wonderful!"
5,Unique & Beautiful,"Komputer are Simon Leonard and David Baker. They have been making music together for quite some time. Previous incarnations (I Start Counting, John Came, Fortran 5) were less poppy. It is very unfair to this dynamic duo to compare them to Kraftwerk. It is fair to say, however, that if you like Kraftwerk, you may also like Komputer. These guys are very English, Kraftwerk is very German, and alone atop the electro pedastal, yet both are kick-butt electronic masters.""World Of Tomorrow"" blends Sharp analog sounds with killer beats, sweeping synths, and catchy melodies - yes I said melodies( If you know Simon and David, they don't always feel the need for melody) to concoct one truely beautiful electronic pop album.Caution; I do use the ""term"" pop loosely. This is still for that very eclectic electro fan. If this describes you - buy it."
2,6 Pc 18/10 Stainless Steel Knife Block Set,"I am not happy with my knife block set. I got it as a Christmas gift and the large knife already has a 1 1/2 inch crack in it. Also, they are not very sharp to begin with. You have to find a good sharpener for them. If I were you, I would find a better quality knife set"
1,Too Heavy,"After trying to use this a couple of times, I gave up because it just weighs my hair down. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone trying to get full, thick looking hair."
4,Great cage for a great price,"Very nice cage I highly recommend it. Very nice price to, may have paid double at your local pet mart. A little tricky putting together though, make sure you use the pic from the site you purchased it from. 4 stars."
5,"A believable, uplifting story of a Christian cult that you don't want to miss!","Shelley Bates has a fantastic way of getting deep into the sludge of apostate and deceptive Christianity (Cults) and addressing the hard-core issues in a non-offensive way that can also be extremely uplifting. Without going into the details of the story, from the very first page, I found myself connected in a deep way to the heroine, Dinah, as she battles a life-long indoctrination in a toxic church and begins to see sparks of light and truth dawn on the darkness. Her relationship with the hero, Matthew is believable and handled with care under the circumstances of the abuse Dinah has had to endure. The ending is satisfying and encouraging. This is definitely a page-turner that will give you a great understanding of the true love and grace of God."
2,CHEAP fun,"I purchased this for my 14 month old boy who loves to help us sweep. For a dustpan, hand sweeper and child size broom the price cannot be beat. My son had gotten a lot of enjoyment out of this set in the week that we had it.My husband stepped on the handle of the broom and crushed it. It appears that under the blue vinyl-like covering the handle is aluminum. The space where it was crushed had sharp points and was completely unrepairable. We're considering buying a different child's broom. We definately won't be buying this one again."
3,schylling junior helper room (from Trend marketing),The broom arrived bent. So it wasn't a surprise that it was only after a few uses that the thing gave way and broke.I don't know where the hiccup came from...whether it was directly from the store or during the shipping.
4,Grand child loves little helper broom.,The broom is just what my grand child wanted. Now she leaves her grandmother's broom alone and can help her sweep the floor.
4,"Not only a fun toy, practically useful too.","My 4-year old loves to play pretend. This toy is not only fun for her, it also teaches her the concept of having a nice clean house.It is a 3-piece set - a long-handle broom, and a desk broom with a matching scooper. The broom is long enough even for an adult, and so my wife and I use it in the kitchen. They are colorful which my kids like.The only thing I notice is that the bristles for desk broom that is made of plastic fibers get easily bent and does not go back to straight position."
2,bad packaging causes knacked broomed delivery,"It is a great toy IF it arrives at your house in a good state. the packaging is so poor that had knacked in the center to a point where it almost broke. It lasted 2 days, and then it did. the low cost of the product prevented us from sending it back, that would probably have been the same costs as to order a new one. But we were very disappointed with the state the broom was delivered in!! So now I am still sharing my adult boom with my 15 month old! (I have no choice in this, to which I am sure all moms can relate!!)"
2,Little fingers will get stuck!,"Within 15 minutes my 18 month old got her finger stuck in the hole in the handle. And I mean stuck, we needed soap to get it out. Not a huge deal, these things happen with kids, but they really should have thought about that before they put a tiny hole there. We put tape over it, so we didn't bother to return it.Of course she likes it! And it's much better than her using the big broom and wacking everything in her way and breaking stuff. Also, the mini broom is a big hit."
1,poor quality,The handle for the broom did not fit the broom part. Not even close. Too much hassle to return. Would not recommend to anyone.
2,broom set,the first one that we got the handle to the large broom was broken in half upon delivery. when we received the replacement and gave it to our son it took him about an hour of playing with it for the handle on the large broom to almost break (handle is dented almost all the way). not very good quality at all. the small broom with the dust pan works fine but the large broom is junk.
2,broom handle arrived bent,Ordered two of these for each of my kids. Opened it in front of them and both brooms were bent. Was not expecting the handles to be so cheaply made. The kids wanted to play with them regardless so I couldn't pack them up and return them.
5,Fun for toddlers,My 2 yr old twins love playing with these brooms. I purchased them because they would always want to play with the real broom. This has been a hit and they play with it alot.
3,Good quality but expensive,"The broom handle is a little long for younger kids and it's a bit heavy b/c of all the bristles. It is well constructed, more so than some full sized adult brooms! If I had realized the handle was so long, I'd have gone to the Dollar Tree and bought a broom, dustpan and whisk broom for $3 and cut the handle shorter. It did arrive in about 3 days."
4,"cute cleaning set, perfect size for little helpers","My daughter loves this, she is always helping me clean around the house. It is made well, the bristles stay in-tact after many uses and it is the perfect size."
4,"Really big ""toy"" broom","The full size broom is nearly that...a real broom with a shorter handle than normal. I feel like its too large for a ""toy broom,"" but the other little broom and pan are toddler-sized and very fun for my toddler."
2,So! So!,"Cheap made... my husband accidentally stepped on the broom handle and bent it! I've actually gotten use out of the mini-sweeper, though."
1,Not for my 5 year old-maybe for younger child.,"Mind you she's not tall! Althouth it advises against, this size toy is more suited for a 3 year old. My five year old enjoys working with it but because the broomstick and mopstick are so short, she can not hold them correctly."
1,Not a neat broom,"This broom was not up to my high standards of neat. I felt that buying this broom would equal hours upon hours of fun, but in reality it only equaled about 2 minutes of fun. I have another broom that I keep in my closet, and it is also not neat, so I was hoping for better luck with this broom. As I've been writing this, I realized that buying a broom for fun purposes was probably not the best move on my part, because in the history of brooms, I think maybe one or 2 were actually fun...and those were magic brooms. Don't buy this broom if you're looking for hours of neat, extraordinary broom fun. You could probably just use it as a normal broom, and it would be ok. If I were to rate it in terms of normal brooms, I would rate it a 4 because there's not really a whole lot to being an ok broom."
2,Not worth the money,"This is a nice toy but not worth the $24.99 I paid for it. As I looked for this item 9 days after my order it was listed for $16.99 & later that same day for $24.94. What kind of company is this?? This is a gift for my granddaughter on her amazon ""wish list"" but I know her parents will be disappointed at what they get for the money."
5,I love this set!!,I bought this set for my 2 year old granddaughter and she loves it. I feel like it is a quality set and she'll play with for a long time
4,Little helper broom set,"My daughter was constantly trying to hold my broom while I swept which, as you can imagine, made it impossible. So we decided to buy her this broom set and she is constantly ""sweeping"" my floors. Well worth the money i spent."
4,"Nice for an active toddler who always wants to ""help""","A big, simple hit with the 2-year-old; though, my dust pan was purple -- no harm for the little boy! Just the right size, and since he likes to sweep the carpet, it's a lot less messy than him using our real broom. A fun toy."
2,Displeased - received in used condition,"My niece got this broom set for her birthday and I knew it would make a perfect gift for my 2 year old. She loves it, but when I opened the package I was upset to see that the product was not in its original condition. It appears to have been used before. I don't mind the wear, but I hate paying full price for a used product."
4,Little Helper Broom Set,My Grandkids love to help around the house. These tools allow them to contribute to house hold responsibilities while having fun at the same time. Good product!
4,fun and useful,my daughter is sixteen months old. she loves this broom and totes it around often. I think it will be more fun when she is a bit older and can actually sweep.
4,"Great Bargan, Good Quality","I bought this for my 2 year old. She loves it. Finally something that looks and works just like Mom's, but that's the right size for a toddler. I found Grandma using it to clean up some crumbs the other day."
3,Good Size For Kids Who Want to Imitate Mom,"My kids would throw such a fit every time I pulled the broom out of the closet to sweep that I purchased this set, thinking they could each have a broom whenever I pulled the ""real"" one out. They both love the long-handled broom, and will happily use that in lieu of my real broom. The hand-sweeper and dust pan don't get much use - yet - though I hold out hope that those will be of more interest as the kids' dexterity and coordination improve (they are 19 months old now. If I were doing it over, I would probably just get the broom. It is a must-have if your kids want to sweep, as the long handle on the ""real"" broom makes that a dangerous toy for other people and objects in the room!"
5,"Good for big people, too!","Not only is it great for the little ones, the dust pan and brush are great for little messes around the house , too. I keep my son's with the big people's broom and use it all the time!"
4,Happy grandmother,"This is just what I was looking for, my granddaughter is 17 months old and this was just her size. Now while I sweep the floor (side walk, porch) she does too! She loves it and so do I."
4,My daughter loves this toy,My daughter is 17 months old and my husband and I could not sweep the floor without her crying for the broom. Since we bought this she helps us sweep and if she wants our broom we switch. It works just as good as the broom we use.
3,Not quite what I was looking for...,"I bought this set for my son, so he would give me back my broom. The small broom and dust pan are well-made and durable. My issue is really with the tall broom. The handle is flimsy and bends easily, and is made with very cheap metal. If bent a little too far, it creates dangerous sharp edges in the handle. We ended up replacing the handle with a regular wooden handle from an old broom, and it has worked well for us since...but I can't recommend this to other parents with good conscience."
3,Broom broke.,"After a few weeks, the handle to the broom got broken off. It looked pretty dangerous since it's aluminum, so that part of it was a waste. The dust pan has survived several months so far."
4,Little Helper Broom set met expectations,I purchased this toy as a gift for a child with Downs' Syndrome. It's easy for him to handle and he loves being Mommy's little helper and cleaning up with his broom set.
4,"Cute, well-made little set.",Cute. Well made. My 19 month old likes it a lot. He ran to get it when the housekeeper arrived the other day. I hope that it will help him to learn how to help out around the house. I think that he is getting the idea.
5,Niece Loved It,"I bought this with a bunch of other cleaning toys for my five-year-old niece. She's had it about two months and, so far, it's held up and she loves it."
1,not happy,"I am not happy with this buy. Received a dust pan and brush, that I could have gotten at the dollar store. I feel this was over priced and not worth the money I paid. My advice is to stay away from item, go to the dollar store. Save your money!"
5,Great for Little Helpers,I bought this broom/dustpan set for my son who loves to help around the house. The broom and dustpan set is wonderful and they really work too! The broom and dustpan are the first toys my son grabs in the morning. He pushes it around and keep himself entertained while I sweep the house. The broom and dustpan are attractive and durable. I found it at a local toy store for a lower price than Amazon.
3,Some nice pictures.,"I'm quite happy with the video. It has some nice photos of the presidential limo, Air Force One, and agents protecting the president. It has many neat historical facts and video clips. It doesn't reveal any juicy details about the Secret Service, as many of their operational procedures are classified. However, it is quite specific about some of their general procedures."
3,slow progression to...nowhere?,"This anime drove me crazy. The story went on forever, barely getting anywhere. It seemed like it would get really good, but I was kept waiting, kept in suspense, for nothing but disappointment. So the ending isn't totally anti-climatic, but it was a big letdown after all they make you go through. I suppose it's worth watching just to see, but if you don't have the patience, then don't bother! Oh yeah, and they seemed to use the same music over and over again, with English lyrics that didn't seem to make sense. At first it was okay, but after a while it became annoying."
4,DVD,"Thanks to this suppliers exeditious shipping, I was able to receive this item in time for Christmas. Item was new as advertised and son hasn't indicated any viewing problems."
3,Poor details for a fair quality jacket,"The issue I have with this jacket is that the poor workmanship (made in China) make the jacket degrade somewhat. Two buttons completely fell off, and occasionally I'd see down on my clothes-telltale signs that somewhere there is a hole in the jacket. However, it provides good warmth (You'd better layer, though) and is more fashionable than other jackets-I've received compliments on its appearance. Its length and button-up hood provide protection for most of your body, including your head. Overall, I'd say it's a fair deal for the Amazon price."
3,Great for boosting your child's english skills.,"A note should be made that while this book contains many fabulous ideas for creative writing, it is geared specifically toward 4th and 5th grade students, using such ideas as, ""If I were an animal, what would I be?"" and ""What would you do if suddenly you traded places with your parents?"" It is formatted as a teacher's supplement to a creative writing class. I ordered this book thinking it was more for adults because no mention was made of its format and content."
3,Great for kids,"Wrongly assuming that I had bought an inspirational tool for writers, I was disappointed to receive an educational bookled with assignments only suitable for young children. Though in that category this book must be one of the best, scoring high on imagination as well as practical use. So I keep this one on the shelf, awaiting the next generation."
2,High School Use,"I was a bit disappointed in the book since I am a high school teacher and was looking for materials to use in my class. It is written for grades 4-8, and says so on the cover. The book's description did not include this information, and my eyes weren't good enough to see it on the picture of the cover. Some of the writing activities can be modified to fit high school students, but there are better books out there for journal topics in the secondary classroom."
4,Truly Talented Composer,"This CD starts with Kaleid-escape - a playful tune similar to something you'd hear as the opening to a TV sit-com. Don't let that fool you. Listen to the intricacies... a foreboding of what's to come. Cavalier Tea Dance starts a little slow - just about when you are going to fast forward to the next song the horns come in ...so you stay a while. Then the sax comes in and now you're really interested - and when the other sax comes in on top for the finale - you just have to hear it again. From there the CD just takes off. Her songs just continue to build until you find yourself sucked into a journey through the Mind Dances of a truly talented, gifted composer. This CD is filled with haunting melodies and little touches that you start to hear on the second and third listening."
5,Interesting interpretation,"Like many people, Siegfried is the least favourite of all the Ring operas. However, I must praise the interesting interpretation and direction of Patrice Chereau here. Just like elsewhere in this centenary Bayreuth production, the drama is so vivid and believable, aided by superior acting on the part of the singers. Although Manfred Jung doesn't exactly conform to my idea of a great helden-tenor, he does well in the production. The other singers also give excellent support, as have Boulez and the excellent Bayreuth orchestra."
4,* PLEASE release the whole series on DVD *,"The episode is good... but I really want Warner to release the whole series in a ""TV on DVD"" format... just like what's happening with Spider-Man -- one series at a time. There's something about classic animation -- 1966-1974 or so... no cartoons/animations evoke the same kind of feelings..."
4,"Hot, but flavorful","I didn't see a ""heat index"" or any indication of hotness when I bought this, but when I received it, it was listed HOT. I don't think is is that hot, but i would prefer a medium version. That being said, this salsa is very flavorful and tastes great. The small cans are nice because the salsa stays fresh if you only use a small amount each serving."
5,Excellent Twofer From The Past,"Here we have a sweet, soulful, two album collection from 1960's Atlantic Records by R&B song stylist, Ben E King. These recordings have been out of print for 40 years and they have been re mastered skillfully by DBK Works of San Francisco. All of the recordings are STEREO. 'Soulful Lovers' consists of standard tunes and standard soul tunes like like 'What A Difference A Day Made' and 'It's All In The Game'. 'Seven Letters'is a real soulful gem of an album where songs like 'It's No Good For Me', 'Si Senor',and 'It's All Over' will rip your heart right out of your chest. Far out, man!"
3,Only half as good,"This CD consists of two previously released LP albums. The latter album titled 'seven letters' was a bestseller and rates as a collector's item, the former 'sings for soulful lovers' was not popular and enjoyed only mediocre sales, hence CD only half good."
2,A rather aggressive take on Bach,"I primarily bought this recording as an interpretive aid (I was specifically interested in the Partita). I am completely against the manner in which Bach is played on this CD. I find it to be an aggressive sort of steamroller interpretation. A big time romanticization. The piano has an odd, almost honkytonk quality to it. If you think that Baroque music should be played in a modern fashion when performed on modern instruments, then go ahead and buy this. Oi!"
5,Sweet Dreams,"This CD is a wonderful gift for new moms. The words and music are soothing and beautifully done. ""The Moment I Saw You"" (Track #9) reminds me of the first time I saw my children and my grandchildren. It reaches my heart every time I listen to it."
2,Written by a[..],"It's a great idea, but poorly executed. Hopefully the second edition will feature:1. A proof-reader.2. A second proof-reader.2. Maps of the fishing sites.Also the fishing sites in the SF Bay area are split between this edition and the ""Central California"" edition, meaning Bay Rea residents, who will form a significant portion of the readership, will be forced to buy two books. Even then Lake Chabot doesn't get featured.In all it's a decent place to start, but online resources are much more detailed and informative."
4,northern ca fishing,"this book is great, however it is starting to become outdated. I visited a few of the lakes in the book, and they were not as described. The landscape has changed and the fishing as changed as well. Good book, and points out several secret places."
4,Box Set Brilliance.,"So I originally bought this box set for the No Protection Cd, (I already had Protection on mp3 format)and was initially moderately pleased w/ Protection despite the negative reviews. I am gonna be honest when I say this was the best CD purchase I have ever made. Protection is not the strongest album to listen to straight through, however if you add it to a playslist of other Massive Attack songs you will learn to appreciate the album. As for No Protection, that album alone has helped increase my respect for Protection. It is a great compliment to the original album. I had read several comments before I purchased it that No Protection was the better of the two discs and while its mostly true, I still turn back to Protection since the first two tracks are by far my favourites.I would highly recommend getting this box set or both CDs alone, creating a playlist or adding them to your Massive Attack playlist. Now to find CD versions of their other remix albums is my next goal."
3,Hayes or Haynes?,"I suspect the reason this book is ""currently unavailable"" is the misspelling of the author's name. Should be Williams Haynes."
1,Terrible,"There is NO companion to God's Word. This is a mormon book where they try to influence you that there is another book in addition to God's Word. The Bible is 100% complete and 100% infalible. If you want the scriptures to back up what I have stated, feel free to ask."
2,Disappointed,I was not impressed with this book at all. It was expecting it to be more than what it was. I would not recommend this book even thou it was a free book.
2,Dont Know,I am tired of going along with someone else's understanding with the way people act. Buy it you want because it is your world.
2,I love ya George But....,"This was perhaps the worst live performance I have ever seen. I LOVE Boy George, and I know he has the chops to back up the diva attitude, but they were missing on this performance. In concerts, it can be about the art, costumes, sets, lighting, vocals, etc... but this concert had none of it. The one lone stand out was the opening by Euan Mortan. Who did a better Boy George than Boy George."
2,Total disappointment,"Don't get me wrong. I'm a huge Boy George and Culture Club fan since the 80's and own EVERY single 12"" and CD that they have released. Let's face it, George's live performances are nothing like you hear on the CDs. He likes to distort the songs and they never come across as clear and soulful, unlike some performers. I felt the old video ""A Kiss Across The Ocean"" was so much more magical than this. This totally lacks the impact and power. Sad to say, I skip throughout the DVD. I wish the record company would release, instead, a definitive Culture Club/Boy George music video DVD. George has always been a chameleon and the videos were simply wonderful. Almost every outstanding 80's act already has Greatest Hits DVD, so why not Culture Club?"
1,At Their Worst,"Boy George comes out with rubber spikes on his head and a checker patterned dress. I loved his outfits in the 80's but this was just distracting. His singing is not great either. He sounds hoarse, he can't hit the high notes, he's out of breath, and he forgets when to start/stop singing on certain songs! My honest reaction was, ""Is he on drugs?"" Then this British singer comes out in the middle to sing this dreary ballad. It brings the concert to a screeching halt. It gives George a chance to change into a black suit, though he looks like a homeless person now, at least my eyes can rest. I've seen Culture Club in concert twice before and had a great time.The interviews with George and John are good but what about Roy and Mikey?"
1,So sad--too bad,You might remember seeing Alex P Keeton eating off this company's dishes on Family Ties. I had the same pattern at my house. Pfaltzgraff is a company that is laying off thousands of Americans to use workers in other countries. I haven't liked their styles as of late-- and now I also disaprove of their practices. I wouldn't buy from them.

3,Backlash Review,For the most part this ppv was good.The main event was a major put down between the rock vs. goldberg but other then that you get to see Brock pulverize that punk cena and Rikishi get revenge on Piper on the behalf of his uncle Snuka.You can also see the los gurreros literally run away with the gold. I give Rey vs. Big show and the six man tag match 9 of 10 stars. If you can rent this DVD don't buy it unless you want to complete your 2003 collection.

2,not that great,"From the reviews on this page I special ordered this book hoping it would be good and I was very dissapointed. The writing is choppy made it hard to get involved in the story line which I will admit is very creative. If you too are tired of every popular black author you read writing about what people are wearing, driving, how their hair looks like, and what club they went this book is not for you. This is an ok first effort but not 5 star material."
4,The Drama was there,"I read this book a few months ago and I can still remember what a great read it was ! This was definitely a story that felt so real ! The drama was on ! Once you start reading it,it will be hard to put it down !"
3,Interesting,I thought this was a very interesting book. For a first time author she did a good job in developing the characters and storyline and keeping things flowing evenly throughout the book. My biggest concern was the amount of slang and foul language.
5,I NEED A SEQUEL TO THIS BOOK,GREAT STORY THAT EVERYONE CAN RELATE TO.STORY STAYED INTERESTING THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE BOOK. COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. SUNGEE KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK. WHEN SHOULD I EXPECT THAT SEQUEL?
1,Garbage,"This stinker is one to avoid, especially for fans of e.e. cummings (who, although they're the target audience, will be most offended!). It consists of a number of embarrasing, cheesy scenes where characters ""act out"" cummings' poetry in context. The result is a an amateurish trainwreck that would be barely worth a high school production, let alone an Amazon rental."
1,They Wouldn't Let Me Give It 0 Stars,"Two MCSD exams covered in one book. The first problem is no distinction what-so-ever exists between the two exams as far as the book is concerned. If you want to fail 2 tests in one day, this is definitely the book for you. The publisher's web site no longer contains ANY information on this title, much less the sorely needed list of corrections to the errors that plague this publication. Truly a waste of time and money."
3,Good for exam prep,"I just pass 70-176. This book help me prepare for the test. It was a good idea to combine in the same book two exams (70-175 & 70-176). This way I discover that the two exams seems to cover the same objectives (like 60% of both exams is dealing with the same stuff - COM & ActiveX, configure VB6 IDE, package&deployment, logical&physical design, creating data services and testing the solution).This is not a book for learning but is a good prepare book for the exam even if I didn't find any question from book in the real test."
2,Don't waste your time.,I found this book not to be very useful. The questions were not even close to being like the Microsoft exam questions and some of there answers were completely wrong. When I bought this book I figured that it would help me prepare for the exam. It didn't. I didn't expect the questions to be like microsofts but they should have been better than this. It also didn't map very well to exam 70-176. It was designed for 70-175 and from what I have heard about this exam this book would prove useless. Save you money and purchase another product.
2,Not as good as Fast Track exam guide,"Don't spend your money on this, not worth it. Those questions are not even close to the test."
2,Only good for review,Don't expect to pass the test with this book alone. This book is a review for the 70-176 test only. I recommend you buy the Master Series from Microsoft Press.
5,Best Ferret Stuff Holder,Oh wonderful chest. I really enjoy the extra spots for things that cant go in a drawer (i.e. drippy oil) on top! I would recommend this to anyone with pets!
1,Crooked Threads - Waste of Money,I was hoping the negative reviews on this spindle adapter were incorrect. I took a chance on it and regret it. This PSI spindle adapter has crooked threads which cause the adapter to wobble when spinning. Also the adapter barely screws onto the spindle. This would be passable if the adapter didn't wobble. This adapters faults plus PSI selling a known faulty product will prevent me from buying anything from them in the future. Obviously their quality control and ethics are lacking. Why continue selling something you know doesn't work? What else are they selling that doesn't work? If there are some adapters that work and some that don't work then sort out the poor quality items so your customers don't suffer from it.
2,Does not Fit,PSI Woodworking LA341018 Headstock Spindle Adapter is the reverse of what I need. The 3/4 inch x10 tpi should be female and the 1 inch x 8tpi should be male.
2,"Wrong, Wrong, Wrong","I ordered the spindle head for an antique lathe I got so I use use conventional accessories, but it's either the wrong size or the wrong hand, it looks to be reversed thread which does not work, and I've heard so many horror stories about PSI's return policies that I just wrote it off and decided not to buy from them again."
2,Get What You Pay For.,"This Adaptor is poorly machined. The 3/4 - 10 ID Threads are very tight and out of round to the point that it almost don't screw onto the lathe spindle.The OD 1"" - 8 thread seems to fit the jaw chuck ok but the OD threads are also out of round and poorly aligned with the ID threads. This misalignment causes heavy chuck runout and vibration.I am looking into another way to put the jaw chuck onto my lathe because the runout and vibration could be dangerous.I would not purchase again.I would not recommend to others."
3,A mile wide but an inch deep,"My first impression after I finished this book was one of real sadness. The suffering inflicted upon this woman by her husband is horrific and will be almost incomprehensible for most readers. However it is clear to me that the author, in lifting at least 50% of this book from potted anti-Moon biographies and diatribes, has not really come to terms with the figure of the Reverend Sun Myung Moon. What I want to know is why so many others, far wiser than the author and much more knowledgeable than her in philosophical and religiouus matters, are duped so easily by this man. And what is his motivation to keep the Washington Times afloat at such a great cost? It is puerile to simply suggest that he is a con artist or a charlatan. This is a story of one woman's tragedy and one man's terrible part in it. That man is Hyo Jin Moon. Sun Myung Moon is still an enigma."
5,Excellent story of trials and triumph,"Wonderful book that exposes Sun Myung Moon for the false prophet he truly is! Nansook Hong's story of abuse from her ungodly in-laws is a must-read. She overcame incredible odds in order to gain a life worth living for herself and her children. I look forward to a sequel: a fitting title would be ""Out of the Shadow of the Moons""."
2,Not quite what it seems,"Nansook Hong paints a painful picture of her marriage to HyoJin Moon, but she does not own up to the full truth of her parents' machinations to get her married into the Moon family. Eyewitnesses tell of Nansook visiting the Moon household and knowing full well of HyoJin's excesses in advance of her marriage. The Hongs wanted desperately for their family to be entwined with the Moon family, and after arranging for one child to be wed to the first Moon daughter, they pushed Nansook to marry a Moon son. Though I don't know all the motives, the point is that there was an agenda behind her marriage and probably this book that Ms. Hong has not been honest about. It is only too easy to paint an unflattering portrait of Rev Moon and his wife but at least some of this is suspect, given her own deceit."
2,What a butthead!,"I was pretty disappointed in this novel. I liked the heroine, but hated the hero. He was such a jerk! I don't mind when they're jerks in the beginning of the story but he was a butt the whole way through. I couldn't understand how she could be in love with this guy. There weren't even moments of a nice guy peeking through. So even though the story was pretty good and the heroine had spunk, the hero ruined the whole thing for me. This is my first time reading this author and I'm afraid to read another one. Oh yah, and he talked down to her like she was a child, and ohhhhhhhh I hate that."
1,Almost didn't finish,"I like most Amanda Quick books but not this one. The heroine Sophy is so immature and irritating to read about. She is constantly throwing things like honor into her husbands face and theagreement that they had come to before the beginning of their marriage, yet she never complies with his request in that same agreement.The other issue I have is she not only drugs her husband but then cOnvinces him that he raped her. While he may have wanted her that is completely unacceptable behavior. I stopped reading this book four times and finally finished it just to see how it ended.While some if the writing is entertaining overall I just couldnt deal with the characters."
2,Disappointed!,"I have read quite a few of Amanda Quick's early books, which I prefer to her books written in 2000. I thought this had a good beginning and was settled into have a fun night of reading. I had to wade through the middle which could only be described as DULL and kept asking myself was she asleep when she wrote this? I finally decided to skip a few chapters and read the last 1/3, it was okay but certainly not as good as ""Mistress"",""Ravished"" or ""Desire"" (my favorite!). I guess since this seems to be one of her first books, I should not be so critical but I was thoroughly disappointed in this book and would not recommend it to anyone."
4,Another Sensation from a Premiere Author,What can I say. I love Amanda Quick novels. Still have not met one I did not like and enjoy a great deal.
4,I love Amanda Quick,I have read every book written by Amanda Quick and loved them all. I always want the hero to realize that he has found his mate and that is what happens in Seduction. Like all of the Amada Quick stories this is a quick read and it fills my romance addiction - what more could you want?
1,What. A. Disgrace.,"I thought I'd give Amanda Quick another try, so this was my second book of hers. I didn't like the first one, but I heard that her 'one-word' titles were good, so I gave this one a shot on the audiobook.I only made it a few hours into the book before I had to stop.At what point does a completely overbearing, arrogant, a-hole seducing an innocent, scared young woman become romantic? Here's how the novel reads:Ravenwood: I have never forced a woman into bed.Sophy: Good, because I want to get to know you better before we...you know.Ravenwood: I promise I won't force you, but don't count on it.*forces her*Seduction of an unwilling woman, even a wife, is NOT sexy or romantic."
2,Not a 5-star video!,"This is a ballet video for the workout-minded. There is very little cueing and little explaination. In the video, Melissa Lowe and 5 other dancers, including one male and one relatively ""heavy"" dancer perform 2 separate +/- 40 minute routines. Each has a very short floor portion, which esp. on the second half, really wasn't long enough to get a good stretch, then barrework, and floor. The pink and blue unitards are somewhat obnoxious. The live piano though helps to soothe this.The barre work is shot from a distance, with no close-ups of the feet or a single dancer. The barre is set up in the middle of the set, so you see some dancers from front and back views, but no side views. Strong previous ballet exposure is suggest (by me). The step aren't explained well, but they are the basics, ya know. There is not a good deal of technique cueing, that's good or bad depending on what you are looking for."
1,very disappointed,"I fail to find any value in this video for a beginner or advanced student. At 39 years old I classify myself as a beginner, though I've taken many classes. I enjoy ballet for it's posture and toning benefits. An advanced student would be bored by this workout-- #1- Very poor stretching and warm-up. #2- Other than a lenghthy discription of the english translation for the french term before each step, the instructor fails to give the most basic instructions--(4xxx followed by a x in 1st, 2nd, 5th repeat with the left side.) #3- May as well be using a book as the instructor doesn't call out the steps as your doing them-- nor the basic reminders of ""stretch your spine, pull in your stomach, etc"" #4- The many dancers and camera angles I found distracting #5- Certainly not the cardio workout I've received in past classes or even with a book. In short I can't think of anyone who would find this tape beneficial."
3,"Good for others maybe, but not for me.","This video is great for someone wanting to rehearse classical ballet and who also has some RECENT formal training in their background; but it was hard for me to get back into the strict regimen and ""toes out"" routine after years away from the barre. I found the tape boring because I prefer more lively exercise videos that are more motivating than this one. More importantly, Ballet Workout 2 was way too serious for an exercise video that needs to ""hook"" you into watching it again and again. Basically, it was no fun and I am returning it."
1,not a great workout,"If you're looking to replicate a ballet class exactly, that's what this DVD is. If you're looking for a good workout with some ballet moves, this DVD is not worthwhile at all. There are lots of exercises that are good for preparing you to dance ballet but useless for general conditioning: for example, point your foot, flex at the ankle, point again then back to starting position. It does include things like plies that are good for conditioning, but too few of these types of exercises to make the tape useful."
1,disappointment,"very basic, and not challenging at all. It was obviously made a LONG time ago, poor production quality. Not what you want if you are looking for a BARR workout."
5,Good for the money,"Cheap and good quality, not much more I could say. The remote wire in the middle is handy and the rubber coating holds up really well."
5,Charming,"I thought this would be just another overly sentimental gift book, until I took the time to actually read it and appreciate the art. I could feel my stress melting away as I spent time looking at each page. I am making a list of friends who will be receiving this charming book for Christmas this year."
1,Good movie. Lousy transfer.,"Disney screwed up this one...big time. The clarity was okay, but the picture itself was really dark. You really had to strain to see what was going on in most scenes, and were rarely successful. I don't know where they got there print from, but Disney needs to trash it, enhance it and remaster the video and sound, just like Paramount did with Star Trek: TOS. I didn't buy a DVD to get VHS quality...and I don't even think I got that."
3,Corny,"It was mildly entertaining. Not great, but there was a lot of action for my 6 year old to enjoy."
4,Rocketeer,"An excellent film, I saw it at my local cinema many years ago and the DVD format has brought it back to life! A lack of extras as always with good films, but it is made up by superb sound and visual quality. Jennifer Connoly looks as stunning as i remebered her from my teenage crush and ex-bond Tim Dalton again makes no mistakes in his performance! In other words he steals the show!! Oh an what happened to William Campbell?? He looked as if he had a great future ahead of him, maybe not such a smart move to give that rocket pack back!!"
2,The EDITED Rocketeer,"I saw this movie in the theater and bought the VHS version as soon as it became available. In the meantime I had made substantial improvements to my home theater so when the DVD became available I ordered it with HIGH expectations!WHAT I SAW WAS EDITED TO THE POINT WHERE ENTIRE KEY SCENES WERE ELIMINATED! If your home theater can play both VHS & DVD, then GET the VHS version. It's much more entertaining!!!!!!!"
5,Good by poor Transfer,"Much much better looking than the dvd. Great film, lots of adventure. Classic fun. Must own for sci fi comic fans and lovers how classic fx."
4,Great Movie,"This movie is great - I wish a sequel had been made, as was originally planned. It would have been nice if the DVD had been anamorphic, but otherwise it is a great product."
5,Great for me!,"I always liked this movie, a simple idea with a great out come. A good story of good verses evil, with a cool strap on rocket. Now i get to enjoy this movie when ever i please."
1,Horrible,"I have loved this movie as a young child and I could never find it in stores. Finally I came across it here and was excited to place my order. And for such a low price I was very happy to do so. After recieving the dvd in the mail though is when all that went out the window. The movie was shipped in a half-ass box without any protection inside. And to add to that, the dvd inside had been moving around for who knows how long. To return the movie to the seller was idiotic because it would cost me that much more for a movie so cheap. Needless to say I wont be ordering anymore DVDs from this particular seller again."
4,Simple DVD.,"For me this movie holds a lot of nostalgia and that makes it great!BUT, this is a really simple version of the movie. No extras, no books, no 5.1 SS."
4,A good Disney adventure!,"The Rocketeer is another 'comic book' movie based on the adventures from the 80s. The laid back airplane pilot Cliff Secord (Bill Campbell) has tested a new plane for the nationals but they find that the plane is a failure (I won't spoil it with why it was). Upon landing, he disovers in another plane there is a mysterious object. Him and his boss test it out and flies like crazy! Stunned, Cliff learns that it is some kind of a jetpack! The Nazis want it, though, and trace Secord. Using his girl Jenny (Jennifer Connelly)the evil Neville Pillsar (Timothy Dalton) the famous actor who works with her gets Cliff to try to give up the pack. But when he learns it is for evil and that Pillsar is a Nazi, he must bash with him and his gang. This suspensful adventure is a great family movie and is just plain fun all the way through! You won't be upset with this movie!"
4,A Great Movie,"This is an awsome movie. The DVD is not much, ut the movie itself makes it worth buying."
4,PRETTY DARN GOOD,"Being a fan of the Rocketeer comic book, I was looking forward to the movie and was not disapppointed. Being a fan of the 1930's, I thought the film did a great job of capturing the look and feel of 30's Hollywood and nightlife.The movie also does a good job of capturing the feel of old movie serials and pulp magazines, both of which I am a fan. Jennifer Connolly is stunning in what I consider her first ""adult"" role.The supporting cast is great. Alan Arkin plays a bumbling scientist type, right out of old movies. Timothy Dalton is fun as the smug, slimy Hollywood star, Paul Sorvino is perfect as a 30's gangster, and Terry O'Quinn, one of the great character actors of modern day, is wonderful as Howard Hughes.A bit slow getting going, the action picks up and has a great climax fight atop a zepplin. Unfortunately, little was done with the DVD package so I am in no hurry to run out and buy it."
2,Not enough time,"I would guess that you get about 2hrs of music for fifty bucks.Nice box set for thirty, not fifty."
2,Overpriced and incomplete,"Overall a good collection, but like the other reviewer said, 2 hours of music for a whopping $50?!?And what happened to the Beatles' ""I Want to Hold your Hand?"" How could that *not* be a Top-10 hit?"
3,"OMIT THE ""NAME GAME"" AND THIS WOULD BE A GOOD COLLECTION","""The Name Game"" is the most idiotic, annoying and atrocious hunk of junk in creation. It has nothing to recommend it and is pure madness. I wouldn't wish ""The Name Game"" on anyone and have detested it since I was a very little child.""Bread and Butter"" would be ok, except the words are pretty stupid.This collection has some good songs, like ""Sugar Shack,"" ""Louie, Louie"" and the Neil Diamond penned hit for the Monkees, ""I'm a Believer."" The 60s was the best musical decade. As I said, omit ""The Name Game"" and you have a good collection. It is like the frog in the punch bowl. The table looks nice, the punch is good, but the frog makes the punch not drinkable. ""The Name Game"" is not hearing friendly and has cost this collection one star."
3,I have serious doubts...,"I have serious doubts that Weis had a lot to do with the actual writing of this book. It seems that Perrin wrote it (perhaps from an outline of Weis) because the writing style is quite different starting from page # 1. Not to say that this is a bad book, it is just not Weis. After getting over that disappointment, I enjoyed the book.(mild spoilers ahead)Scrounger is an excellent addition to the DL canon, and I really dug it when he 'learned' fear. The whole Kitiara 'side' story could have been a novel in its own right. I found it kind of unbelieveable when the three siblings 'missed' one another towards the end."
4,Great story; needs more magic,"I thought ""Brothers in Arms"" was overall a great book, and I've always loved Maragaret Weis's writings. Raistlin was awesome as always, and Kitiara's story was cool too. I've gotta say that the book really hit a low point on magic, though. I was really hoping for some ""magic combined with steel"" battles, but there were far too few of these in the book. I was also kindof hoping for some new or unseen spells to emerge. Far too few did. Otherwise the characters were fantastic as always. Weis has done a fantastic job with the settings and characters."
3,Interesting but disappointing character-wise,"I was sorely disappointed with the development of the story of the twins. The storyline was not too bad especially the parts on how armies were trained. The detail was fascinating.However, this is essentially a book about the brothers Majere and while they are in the book, they aren't developed fully. Pardon me if I am wrong, I am a great fan of Raistlin but the Raistlin in this book is rather insipid compared to what he was before. I mean he is rather namby pamby and there isn't any of the fire he exhibits before in earlier books or the sarcasm he begins with. Perhaps it's because the story's more focused on Kitiara. I think Kitiara's descent into darkness is vey much well fleshed out.I like the story but I think more could have been done on developing the characters.Still, on the whole, =) Raistlin rules....Keep on writing Weis!"
3,The Continuing adventures of Raist,"This book continues the pre-dragonlance lives of the twins Raist and Caramon. Long time fans of Dragonlance will find this a must read. The dark mage has always been a good topic. This book (like Soulforge) however, lacks certain elements that the origanl Dragonlance trilogy had much less the 2nd trilogy and ""Summer Flame"". If you are a long time fan of Weis (and Hickman) this book is worth the read. If you are just beginning to find the Dragonlance worlds, I strongly suggest reading the earlier books ... or would that be the later books?"
4,Revealed more about raistlins personality,The book was interesting for me in that i am an avid fan of Raistlins character and enjoy reading about him. As usual margaret tells his story perfectly.
5,Brothers in Arms is great.,"The main reason that Brothers in Arms is so good is that it shows some of the hardships Raistlin goes through after his test at the Tower of High Sorcery. Even though Raistlin is left very weak and sick after his test, the magic that he posesses is shown to be his true strength. This book is a must read for any Raistlin, or Dragonlance, fan. This book is also so easy to follow that someone new to the world of Krynn will have no trouble enjoying or following along with the storyline, but at the same time a longtime adventurer in Krynn will not be offended by the simple explanations for every detail."
5,She does it again!,"Cool new characters, good storyline and, of course, Raistlin. Its nice to see Raistlin not so bitter even though you can see it won't last much longer."
4,Out in the real world,"This Book shows us how the brothers learned to fight together. It is like when a student graduates from school and has to go out and join the real world. The characters seem a little out of place until the reader realizes that Raistlin and Caramon are still discovering who they are. Raistlin is now dealing with his physical changes, and reluctantly learning that he still has a lot to learn. Caramon is is seen as the kid who was shown how to hold a sword and thinks that he knows how to use it. Personally though, I enjoyed watching how Kit joined the dragon armies. This tale shows us how these characters develop into the ones that we all know and love. My only complaint about this book is that there is too much going on at once watching all three characters develop. This is an involved read that you will not enjoy if you try to rush through it."
3,Brothers in Arms,"I enjoyed this book, but there is absolutely no reason to have Caramon resemble Gomer Pyle when training as a mercenary. He may be naive to the world at this point in his life, but he is not a fool either. It sometimes seemed as if Seargent Carter and Gomer had enlisted in the Mad Baron's army."
3,Disappointed,"Any of you who are big Raistlin fans like myself, will be a little disappointed in how he is portrayed in this book. In the Soulforge and throughout the Chronicles and Legends trilogies, he is always one step ahead of everyone else. Always seems to know a little bit more about each situation than everyone else as well. In Brothers in Arms, he seems to be one step behind in everything, including casting his magic. The storyline was ok but not very entertaining, unless you like reading about military life as a mercenary. The book is really for Kitaria fans. Those of you who are fans of her character will really enjoy seeing how she begins her ascent to Dragon Highlord. The book has some good moments, but compared to what Dragonlance fans are used to reading from Margaret Weis its a little disappointing."
3,written for financial reasons I am sure,This is not a bad novel but it didn't need writing its like a desperate attempt to fill gaps that don't need filling. It's enjoyable don't get me wrong but it could have been better if it was thought through more.
2,Disappointed,Big disappointment after Soulforge. Weis is much better off without Don Perrin. He obvliously got to help because of his relationship to Weis and not because of any writing abilities. Glad I got this from the library. Would have been ticked if I had wasted 6 bucks on it.
3,So-so.,"It could have been better, but there were some parts that were just sophmoric, unrealistic and unecessary. This is pulp fiction that can entertain, but unfortunately, parts of the book are forgettable."
4,A thing of beauty and protection,"The Canon LP1014 Soft Lens Pouch is a high quality lens bag that offers ample room for a variety of prime and smaller zoom lenses. I purchased it for my EF 50mm f/1.4 USM lens. Candidly, the bag's too big for this small lens, but the extra room allows me to throw in the tulip hood, too. The construction and materials are top quality. There are cheaper lens pouches available, but knowing this is a Canon product gives you peace-of-mind and good looks!"
4,"Pleasant, noncontroversial and fun.",My 3 year old boy likes this book quite a bit. He likes to have all three stories read to him before he goes to sleep each night. The stories are pleasant enough and the illustrations are colorful. I find the book a little bland but the noncontroversial nature of the characters (there's none of the meanness that characterizes some of the Thomas characters) and the simple storylines makes for good bedtime reading.
5,The mess not to be missed,"While many other poetry books try to emulate real life, Something of a Mess illustrates the actual story behind the author. Through the poetry, the author communicates the griping complexities of everyday (and no so everyday) life.This book examines the true character of teenage girl going through the transitions of her generation; from love to friendship to the confusion of self-realization and back again, the author's life is ""something of mess,"" so-to-speak. However, this is a grand and inviting tale that universally relates to any reader.Throughout the writing, the author helps to explain her life in a way that is fluid and artistic with great style and poise. This story of a girl is not be missed by anyone who has ever withstood the trials of growing up."
3,"Ehh, not too bad cup dispenser...","This is a decent cup dispensor, but it seldom dispenses 1 cup at a time. I've pulled anywhere from 1 to 10 cups, but it depends both on the quality of your disposable cups and how gingerly you pull down on a cup (believe it or not, this is harder than it would seem). 8 oz. cups are the best, 10 oz. and 4 oz. cups really don't work so well. At least it lets me take the cups off the table and free some space."
4,wonderful writing,"Raintree county is a good example of the type of literature that a genius produces,and I believe it is the kind of book best enjoyed by serious readers. I found the quality of the narration to be forceful and compelling. Although Lockeridge's writing seems to me less lyrical than Thomas Wolfe's, overall,I liked his book better than Wolfe's ""Look Homeward Angel"""
1,Very disappointed,"Loved the movie; hated the book. I just don't understand all the glowing reviews (5 stars!)as I found this novel rambling, boring and way too long.....and all those flashbacks drove me crazy! A major disappointment."
3,NOT the great american Novel,"Maybe to that limited set of writers who thinak they are the Homers of today.But a great american novel would be read by many people with differing levels of appreciation and determined to refelct the CURRENT and essence of America (oh what about south america) not just the mythical past.THe words may flow as a poem, and cover or expound cleary or lyrically the points of life in this country but that alone does not make it a great story. Or a timeless one."
4,kaystimo,"I have hyper- pigmentation but want to still do my sports.This is so far the most user friendly sun block if you need to be in sun a while and want to wear out in public.I use this mostly for cycling and swimming in weaker, early am or late afternoon sun.Can turn white and look a bit unsightly if in water or sweat- not for the vain.( A while in the water makes this wear away)But I still faithfully use and one of the best products for someone with my sun sensitive skin condition.For very strong sun like Mexico Maya Riviera or Midddle East, wear this under the ALOE GATOR 40+ gel."
4,Surprisingly Good,"This is a great film. It is entertaining, suspenseful, and effectively produced. I didn't like the female lead, but then again, this isn't ultimately a problem. I kept this on my ""watchlist"" for a long time. It was recommended by Amazon based on my viewing history. Honestly, the cover picture turned me off. It like just another female slasher victim movie. This is not the case. I think you will like it."
1,"Okay, let me see...","Well... Either the reviewers on here are all being very sarcastic or they are true morons. This was the worst piece of garbage I've ever seen. I turned it off after 40 minutes. The two cops look and act like cartoon characters, and the writing is beyond amateurish. And seeing a perfectly clean butcher knife laying in a big puddle of blood in the first 2 minutes (supposedly the murder weapon), I knew it was made by an idiot. They couldn't even put like, I don't know, a little smear of blood on it? Or a few drops or something to make it realistic? Unbelievable to me."
4,Andersonville,"Over the last few decades, most Civil War movies were made for TV. Andersonville is no exception. Unlike most others, it does not focus on the battles, the politics or the leaders. It does exhibit the cruelty, bravery and dignity of people in the most inhumane circumstances. Civil War prisons, especially in the South, were notoriuosly over crowded, unsanitary, filthy, and repressive leaving little hope for survival. Thousands of prisoners died of disease and those who survived were generally near starvation. In spite of all the adversity, this movie depicts the never dying spirit of the human soul. The strong faith and spirit of these prisioners coupled with their unwavering will to live is portrayed through the eyes of a Massuchusetts Regiment captured at Cold Harbor. Although Andersonville can be a bit depressing to watch, the overall impact of the movie makes this film very worthwhile."
3,"Grim, but should be viewed for historical significance.","While this is a grim, often brutal story, the history of this little known prison, and the struggles of the inmates is heroic, at the same time.Many people are completely unaware of the stories surrounding Andersonville Prison.Wirz is depicted as a ""madman"" by some, but it should be noted that he often had to deal with many shortages of food, medical equipment, and supplies, as the South was concentrating it's efforts elsewhere, in order to try to win the war.I viewed this story as an example of man's inhumanity to man, but also as an example of man's struggles to survive, in spite of horrific odds."
4,GREAT EPIC\A LITTLE PIECE OF HELL,"THIS WAS A GREAT LITTLE GEM OF A MOVIE,BUT I DOUBT ONCE YOU SEE IT YOU WOULD WANT A SECOND LOOK.THIS MOVIE IS BRUTAL.THE LAST TIME I WATCHED SOMETHING SO NASTY WAS{THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST}.BELIEVE ME ANDERSONVILLE SHOWS YOU NO PASSION OR COMPASSION FOR THAT MATTER.THE PRISON CAMP WOULD MAKE YOU WISH YOU WAS DEAD OR FOUGHT TO THE DEATH & NEVER BEEN CAPTURED IN THE FIRST PLACE.ANDERSONVILLE A.K.A. HELL"
4,Andersonville,"My husband and I enjoyed this movie. The only thing I could say ""bad"" about the movie is that it doesn't seem to play in every DVD player. My mom tried it in hers and it pixilates and or jumps around. Not very clear on hers either.Other movies are playing just fine on her DVD but not that one. But outside of that, the movie is very good and worth watching and buying."
5,Truth or Dare?,"Andersonville is one of those few movies that stick to the facts. The realities of war and prisoners of war. It's not a preety film, but it is gripping. And seeing it is what started my interest in learning more about Andersonville and the Civil War. I have even since taken 2 trips to Andersonville just to see the place that the events took place in. It is so moving. My children have also watched it, found it facinating, and hopefully learned something from it."
4,Good and bad in every group.,"Andersonville was a film made about 30-40 years too late. These days, with the internet and cable TV, we need far less reminding of how cruel we can be. It is a good film."
1,"A good ole Rebel, New Orleans","I will not watch the movie ""Andersonville"" until they make a movie called ""Elmira""(the camp in Elmira, N.Y., the worst of the Union prison camps had 35% death rate)."
1,Anti-Southern Propaganda,"This movies rates right up there with ""Schindler's List"" . . . in terms of unapologetic propaganda. Fortunately, Ted Turner showed some remorse for this hatchet job by making ""Gettysburg,"" and the even better ""Gods and Generals.""If you want to see a real, accurate depiction of the War For Southern Independence (aka, The Civil War), watch ""Gods and Generals"" or ""Gone With The Wind,"" and stay away from movie garbage like ""Andersonville.""Also watch for the extended version DVD of ""Gods and Generals"" coming for the Christmas season of 2005."
5,Excellent Civil War Drama,"This fine movie focuses on one aspect of the war; namely, prisoners of war, and, therefore has considerably more substance than most Civil War dramas. The fact that I've viewed this more than once should speak for itself. The fine ensemble cast makes it work with support from hundreds of civil war re-enactors. As with any historical drama, it sometimes is loose with the facts as pointed out by other reviewers. If you want accuracy, you should consult as many sources as possible to negate bias. I do take issue with the idea that conditions at Andersonville were related to the southern war shortages. This same excuse has been used to explain away the treatment of allied POWs by the Japanese and also the holocaust. That part of Georgia had an abundance of corn and rice so there was no excuse for the starvation. As for Ted Turner's ""yankee bias"", in ""Gettysburg"" he was wearing a Confederate uniform."
2,Ted Turner's politically correct opus,"Looking to cash in on the success of the ""Gettysburg"" movie, TNT brought in a big name director to helm this miniseries about the worst prison camp of the Civil War. The movie has a great look, is well directed, beautifully filmed and has some solid performances. But one can't shake the overwhelming feeling that this is just another media attempt to bash the south and stereotype white southerners as cruel and dimwitted. My ancestors fought for the Union and if I had lived back then I would have too. But I can smell Ted Turner's attempt to brainwash viewers with his politically correct message despite the fact it has been so skillfully hidden behind the varnish of this lavish production. Do yourself a favor. Bypass this ""feel good about feeling bad"" movie and read a quality history book about Andersonville instead. END"
1,More myth than reality,"Even Yankee authors have portrayed Captain Henry Wirz as a compassionate gentleman, not the monster seen here. Food supplies cut off by the Northern armies, refusal to exchange prisoners by Lincoln, and a death rate of the guards of equal percentage to the prisoners are just a few of the facts left out of this sham."
2,Andersonville,"My husband had seen this movie when he was young and had talked so much about it that I went to Amazon (where you can find anything you want) and ordered it for his birthday. He was so excited that I had found it but was disappointed that it was not the orginal movie. He said it was good, full of history ""the real story"" of that period but did drag a little. All in all, I think he was pleased that I had even found the movie to share with his friends."
5,JAM Extraordinaire,"This is by far one of the very best compilations of hardcore jams that I have had the pleasure of listening to. I found volume 1 in the store and liked it so much, I went bought the 4 CD box set from Amazon.com. Thank you so much for having this offering on your site. I have been looking for a good compilation of these songs, and haven't been able to find the right set. This set offeres the hardest of hardcore jams. GREAT JOB and THANK YOU!"
2,night before christmas book,"I had this book growing up and read it every Christmas time. We had an attic fire and lost everything. As Christmas time approached I remembered my book I no longer had. With that, searched to see if I could replace it. When I saw it on Amazon, the picture shown was identical to my book. I ordered it right away. When received, it was blue not white, totally didn't expect that. That is what disappointed me. I wanted the one in the picture, not a blue cover. So that is what caused 2 stars for me."
3,"Classic, but disappointing...","It might be a classic story, but left me rather disappointed and it left my son not really knowing what to make of it. It's pretty short, the text is sparse, and the drawings/artwork left much to be desired. It's more like a short Aesop fable than a stand-alone storybook.I gave it an average review simply because it's one that I might read to him when he's older to teach him how to let things roll off his back -- how the sadu didn't hold on to the mouse's ungratefulness. The sadu just went on doing what he had been doing beforehand."
3,somewhat disappointed,"I am satisfied with the tv cart, the thing that I am disappointed in is, the picture shows it as oak and black, that is what I wanted, only in the description does it say black, which is what I received, it was all black. I was so excited to put it together when it came, I didn't realize it was wrong until it was completely assembled. I didn't want to have to take it apart again, so I just have to live with the mistake."
2,Good Enough for Government Work,"The Atlantic Salmon Handbook seems to cover most of the basics reasonably well, although I was still left with some questions after reading it. Also, the author's chatty style leads to numerous digressions that distract the reader and make the book less organized and more difficult to read. I would suggest checking into alternatives to the Atlantic Salmon Handbook, but if none is available, this book is ""good enough for government work."""
3,A good starting place,"This is the best modern introductory book for Atlantic Salmon fishing, and the one least likely to lead you astray. That said it has some severe limitations, mostly from brevity - works by Joe Bates, Charles Phair, and Lee Wulff would be worthwhile to explore."
3,A Little slow,I found this book difficult to stay with -- The premise was magical but the ending predictable. A feel good book.
4,Introducing the REAL driller killers,"This is a two CD set of Neubauten's more harsher moments. Occasionally beautiful, occasionally irritating and of course occasionally that little bit scary. I just saw them live yesterday and whatever about them "" mellowing out "" ( which on evidence of their latest albums you would think so ) - live they're still one hell of a noisy band. Still this is recommended to all industrial connoiseurs ( whereever they are ) and that's about it really. Although one last thing - was two CDs really necessary? It easily could have got by on one but I'm not going to complain on that one"
1,A disappointment of unrealised potential...,"I was so disappointed by this book. It could have given great insight as to President Abdurrahman Wahid's short rule, but instead Witoelar constructs a log of oh-my-gosh, gob-smacked, name-dropping of all the celebrities and politico's he gets to meet in the company of the President. I learned a lot more reading Greg Barton's biography of Wahid. For anyone seriously interested in Indonesia and that time, I'd highly recommend that book instead of this one."
4,Good for young kids,"Overall, this is a good beginning scooter for young kids. It's not lightning fast, but then, you probably don't want it to be. The 3-wheel construction makes balance a non-issue, but (as with any 3-wheel design) you may find that with a rear wheel on each side, instead of one in the middle, the back wheels get in the way when kicking. If you have a kid with a good sense of balance, a traditional 2 wheel design might be better because of this, but for a younger child that needs help with balance, this is a good place to start."
3,Good for Grad Students,"It's a good book were I studied more in Entropy, Channel Capacity, Parallel Gaussian Channels, Rate distortion Theory. But the drawback is more solved problems and detailed explanations for the formulas were not there which would have been of great help for the readers in understanding the concept well."
2,Disappointing...,"This is the standard reference on the subject, but I found it very disappointing. The chapters felt disjointed to me. But what is more problematic is the lack of rigor in the writing. For example, terms are used without being precisely defined; assumptions are made without this being made explicit; and descriptions are given without precision. (A good example of the latter is the section on Huffman coding, where the algorithm is ""specified"" by giving two examples.)The book may be good as a reference (time will tell...) but I did not find it good for learning the material."
2,"Not what I thought it would be. I thought it would call out the math problems, but you just use the numbers your hands are on.","Wanted it for my blind grandson, but it didn't work the way I had hoped. Useful as a beach ball!"
4,Gumnaam Review,"Odd Movie. Need the English Subtitles to follow it. Kind of a 60's Musical, Murder Mansion Mystery. With India themes and actors. Some say it is a cult classic. Some say it represents the best of India Cinema (Bollywood). I can't say I would have even looked this up if it wasn't for the opening Dance-musical number that was made famous in the opening of the movie Ghost World. This movie has the complete original version of that fun, catchy Dance Tune, that is also recently used in the latest Hienikin Beer Commercial. This is a very unusual movie, not for all tastes, and the majority of the tunes are India 60's style Romance and Pop type tunes. Kinda whiney, as they go. But, boy oh boy, that great Opening Dance Tune alone will be worth the cost of the DVD. I'm sure you'll play it again many times."
1,Beware; Wrong Edition Sent,"I was sent the Ultra edition, and not the Eros, as was described. The Ultra is a very poor print, with washed-out color, and missing minutes. Even worse, the Ultra logo keeps appearing on the film, that is, on television screen, while trying to watch it. Maddening. Unfortunately, I removed the packaging and inspected the DVD too long after delivery for a return. The buying page said that the DVD was manufactured on demand. If this was true, it was manufactured from a different source than described."
5,Great cd!,"Recorded Live in Chicago as a souvenir of the Subs USA tour of 1984. U.K. Subs on this recording were Pete Davis (drums), Captain Scarlett (guitar), Tezz Roberts (bass), & Charlie Harper (vocals).Tracks...1) Intro2) Emotional Blackmail3) New Barbarians4) In The Wild5) Veronique6) Flood Of Lies7) Warhead8) Limo Life9) Disease10) Violent Revolution11) Soldiers Of Fortune12) Ice Age13) Dress Code14) Telephone Numbers15) Stranglehold16) You Don't Belong17) Party In Paris"
2,customers beware...,"...and take notice that this book has a total of 352 pages, of which :206 (plus an 18-page introduction) are pure text; 123 are black and white illustrations; and only 8 (eight) color plates, most of well known and widely reproduced artworks by FMB, such as ""work"", ""pretty-baa lambs"" and ""the last of England"". If you are expecting a lavishly illustrated volume, you'll be as disappointed as I am, thus the low rating I have given. It is my personal opinion, and by no means I am judging the essay by Mr. Bendiner, which I have not read; for this you can read the review below."
2,Buy something else,"I purchased this car power splitting device and it works, just not very well. It does not come with a fuse, so if there is a power overload (and yes, I had one), then this product will start to melt until it blows out the fuse in your car. So spend a little extra money and pick up a splitter with a fuse in it."
4,functional; I have a couple of complaints,"It's functional.However there are a couple of problems.In my 2003 Nissan Altima, it would sometimes come out of the outlet, especially when a passenger rests his leg on it. Also, not all that durable. I'm ordering another one since my first one broke when it got ripped out of the outlet. I'm just glad this broke first preventing damage to the car's outlet."
2,Works great - until it overheats,"I've had the adapter for the last 5 months - and it's dead. It was very useful to power a GPS and phone charger until it started to overheat and fill the cabin with a white smoke !!I've used it with the same two devices all along - so doesn't seems to be any change in voltage or anything, but something that went wrong over time.Giving it two-stars instead of one because, even though it almost caught on fire, it didn't damage both devices connected..."
2,Not recommended,"My car has a vertical lighter socket. It works ok when using one outlet. But everytime I use both the outlets, the nozzle loosens out slowly with road bumps in my volvo s40 and I end up readjusting it fair number of times. Will not recommend to anyone...may work with another car. I donot know what will work the best but definitely not this."
5,Support quality music,"Ada, I like your review, but telling people to search blogs to seek a free version of this album doesn't help Othello make any money to support his next album. The only reason you had to import this, was because quality rap doesn't sell in America, so all the talent has gone overseas. Yes great American rappers are forced to sell their product in other countries in order to feed their families, while garbage like T-pain and 50 Cent sells like crazy over here.So in the end, I say buy this album and help support our fellow American, Othello keep making dope music. If you want to buy local, you can get it at: Sphereofhiphop.com"
5,the best of it's kind,"This author de-bunks the myths perpetrated by the investment industry. He also lays out a path for following your bliss. He is so right on and his resources are very, very useful. He simplifies the big pictures and puts you on the map for a positive early-retirement experience."
2,"Unless you need the very basics, not helpful","I am glad that I checked this book out of the library instead of purchasing it. There was very little useful information in this book. Most of his suggestions are common knowledge. For example: pay down you debt, new cars depreciate rapidly, and it costs more to live in certain regions on the East and West Coast.I also found his style of writing off-putting. A sizable chunk of his suggestions have been gleaned from interviews with others and he doesn't have much personal insight to share. Also, I question his credibility. Who writes a book about frugality then talks about his $200 blazer, $100 shoes, and 3 brand new cars in a decade?Overall, if you are brand new to the idea of living within your means, this book might be a helpful primer. Otherwise, you are better off with more comprehensive books."
2,should have been a 25 page pamphlet,"I bought this book thinking I would find really helpful advice for getting by on a tight budget. That just was not the case. Obviosly, it's cheaper to buy soda by the case load, and not one can at a time at work. Maybe this book is great if you really know absolutely nothing about money but I'm certain that there must be better books out there somewhere. The author owes me 12 bucks--amoritize that over the next 40 years!"
2,VERY basic information...,Only helpful if you know next to nothing about living below your means and the importance of not having credit card debt.
5,A must have for any financial library,"Fred Brock continues to provide awesome information. I highly recommend this book for everyone and should be bought in conjunction with his other book ""Retire on Less Than You Think"". This is a quick read with tons of information. I loan it out to friends all the time."
2,Too many interviews,"I feel like Fred didn't do a lot of research to write this book. He cites interviews with 'experts' but those interviewed sound too much like the author's own voice. Sort of like the phony 'man on the street' interviews you see in Cosmo magazine.Who is this book for? If it is for the young, then why a chapter on retirement and funding your children's education? If it is for those ready to retire, then the reader probably already knows all this information, and tons more.Self help books such as this one are only helpful if the author has done due diligence, and really dug deep to find facts."
3,Buy if you need the basics in personal finance,"This book would be a great gift for a graduating senior from high school or college, but is of little use to some one who has been managing their personal finances for years. He discusses debt,insurance,education,car payments,credit cards, and retirement.If you understand that you should avoid credit card debt, stay away from car payments, not buy gimmick insurance, and max out your 401K contribution you do not need this book. I suggest ""Financial Peace"" or ""Total Money Makeover"" both from Dave Ramesay to really it more in depth and to get your money's worth."
2,Good if you know next to nothing,"Look, If you have a bachelor's degree and don't know at least 75% of what's in this book, you need to go back to school. Most of this stuff is everyday knowledge to those of us who care about our money. This book is for those who finally woke up one day and said, ""I need to start saving but I don't know how"". The book basically says, analyze your needs, don't overspend, don't buy a new car (vs used), don't have credit card debt, save b/c you can't count on social security, and live in a lost cost area (Iowa). That's it. I just told you the whole book. Net: If you know nothing, get it, its worth it for $6, but me personally? I wasted my money."
3,Wide choice but too short,"On this CD, there are 38 tunes. There is no song; only tunes. The tunes are often very short, between 30 seconds and one minute. So, it is really a kind of short introduction for an event. It is not also the best orchestration that I have heard but it is at least a good CD in case of emergency when you need a tune for a special occasion. Buy it if you need it but look also for other CD if you prefer songs instead of tunes or if you prefer longer versions."
4,Totally bizarre,"I'm not sure whether I like or dislike this...the music is incredibly strange, it makes no sense really. Not what I expected from a band in the industrial genre. The album goes from sounding like 70's psychadelic ambient to on the verge of unlistenable noise on the last two (live?) tracks. ""we need discepline in here!!"" ...What the hell?If you're into strange stuff, or the 'avant garde', give them a try."
2,dark acid drips,"Although the world at large won't like this album, it will please fans of late 70's experimental rock music (lots of weird noizes, synths, and old school analog effects devices set to stiff drum machine beats). The instrumental songs are dark, twisted, and somewhat ambient sounding. The angst vocal songs remind me of what the Residents would sound like if they lost their sense of humor, and started shooting heroin during an acid trip. Aliens will love this album."
4,Hot On The Heels Of TG,"The poppiest Throbbing Gristle release ever, this is enjoyable from start to finish. They kept their arty pose, their performance artists pedigree and their weird lunatic essence, but the tunes are more accessible and traditionally melodic in its minimal fashion. This time they decided to create a listenable record without losing their integrity and indie-industrial credibility, and we have to give them credits for achieving this purpose so successfully. After listening to ''Exotica'', both ''Disciplines'' and ''Hot In The Heels Of Love'', it's hard to swallow contemporary minimal acts with nothing new to add to this noisy way paved by its masters."
2,cd song selection for this box set could of been much better,"of all the billboard cds, this box set of 85-89 does not contain enough of the top hits of this period. most of the songs are of the flip side vintage. the grouping and selection of songs surely does not reflect the top hits of 1985-89.a far cry from the best of billboards efforts on previous years. for myself, a disappointment."
3,"If you are going to do it,do it right.","While this box set may be a good overview of the 80's it however left out some pretty big bands and singers. Where is michael jackson? Madonna? Duran Duran? Bruce Sprinstine? i could go on. I could forgive these oversights if ""Billboard"" wasn't part of this box set's title; billboard is suppose to be the definitive authority when it comes to top hits and music charts so to put out such a box set with the above glaring omissions kind of leaves one short changed. Stil, a nice collection."
5,YOU MUST GET,"This collection is terrific. During the 85-89 era, I was a teenager, and this brings back all the great memories."
3,Okay.,"First, I'll like to comment on the termiology. I'm PhD specializing in stochastic simulation in operations researcn and I've found the book is written in a language that's not quite standard (it might have something to do with his background in Statistics). Some people may argue that ""names"" are just ""names"" but it could cause confusion. And, in the chapter of stochastic approximation, the author failed to mention a couple of well-known existing methodology (somehow show a poor literature review in the field.) Strong emphasis has been given on importance sampling on that particular chapter, but author failed to mention in what context will importance sampling work. If you assume Bayesian approach and have prior on the parameters, then it works. But, if you're a frequentist, it's not necessarily working for your model.Going back to the first chapter, I found the construction of MCMC is presented much more clearly in Sheldon Ross's Probability Model rather than this book."
5,Essential for any fan of American music!,"With the songs on this album, Lynyrd Skynyrd changed the face of American music, blurred the line between country and rock, and brought both to a new high. If you enjoy either of these genres, you owe yourself this album. The single best song is ""Free Bird,"" but they're all worth listening to more than once. The slight racial and political tendencies of the lyrics might bother some, but they're far more representative of an era than of the artists themselves."
1,Where are the good Ones?,"What rocket scientists came up with this poor excuse for a Best of... Album? Considering that Skynyrd only produced a couple of studio albums it is strange that several of their best songs are not included. The most glaring omission is ""Tuesdays gone"", they also should have had ""Simple Man"", ""Curtis Loew"", and ""the Needle and the Spoon"". These songs are much better than some of the songs that were included. I hate to give only one star to an album by A great band like this, but it is just not what I am looking for in a Greatest Hits album"
5,Great Information,This book is filled with great informatio regarding the holy city of Benares with captioned photograghs and much more.
1,Not as illustrated!,Buyer beware! The salt and pepper set in the photo is not what is sent! The photo shows a raised 3-D pattern with holly but what is sent is not 3-D and is not a holly design. Plus it had some small bare spots on the lower part of the sides where the glaze had not stuck. I was very disappointed but at the low price I paid I donated it to charity rather than pay to return ship the set. At the current price now charged the set is a ripoff!
5,10 Star +,"Awesome Awesome AwesomeAllows you to take great shots during daylight hours. Golden hours are great, but sometimes you can't catch it.Do a google on 10 stop , tons of examples and tips on how to perfect it. Recommend you always download this app called ND TIMER (ie. iPhone/ Android) so you can get a better idea of shutter times.P.s. prepared to buy extra batters, bulb mode reduces your battery life FAST. Also , one thing to keep in mind. You have to always focus and compose your shot first, then screw on filter. Can be a pain in the _______ but hey, who said photography was EASY ! Have fun"
1,Unusable on my D800,"Having used this filter with a Nikkor 17-35mm f/2.8, Nikkor 24-70 f/2.8 and Nikkor 70-200mm f/2.8 on my D800 I can confirm that there is a horrible purple color shift that appears when using this filter. In addition to shifting color, it also introduces a completely non-correctable grid pattern in the purple fringe area.Not sure if this filter is just broken with the D800's sensor or I received a dud, but it is completely unusable in this state."
1,Terrible Uncorrectable Colour Shifting,"I got this 10 stop filter to do long exposure shots in full daylight. While it did exactly what is was supposed to (knock down the light level so I do could long exposures in direct sunlight), it introduced a horrific magenta colour shift to parts of the image. If it had been a uniform colour shift, it would have been easily correctable in post, but because of the non-uniform shift, it was entirely uncorrectable. After doing some reading online it looks like this has something to do with IR. I bought B+W without doing any research because of my respect for the name and prior experience with their products. Shame on me for not doing my homework. This filter is completely worthless. My only regret (aside from buying it in the first place) is that I no longer have the original packaging to return it.Long story short: DO NOT BUY!"
1,3m Dent Puller,"This seemed to do more harm than good for my car. I tried to pull a ding out on the side of my car with this, and it pulled it about half way out. BUT, it actually made a new dent where the rubber of the suction cup was pulling. So... I say if you want to get a dent pulled to look like new, go to a body shop. Any other means to get dents out have been without avail."
3,Did not work entirely,"Maybe I expected too much but it only pulled some of the dent out. In other words, it reduced the dent, but could not pull the remaining ""smaller dent"" out."
3,"""Thee Mission"" finishes up","This is the final 'official' release by Throbbing Gristle, originally only included as part of a 5-LP boxed set released in the early 80s. Later, this 'limited' release saw reissue as a single LP. At this point in TG's work, the fun was all over except for the last noise as required by contract, and that's pretty much what's going on here. Recorded in the audience at their final concert in San Francisco, the audio quality of this album is rather dodgy, as is some of the material. However, there are moments of wild brilliance, notably 'Spirits Flying' and the closer, 'Discipline'. But this isn't even up to the par of some of their other 'bootleg' concert recordings. One for completists."
3,Shouldn't Have To Pay For This,"This is a good article, but people shouldn't have to pay for it. This, and many other press articles, can be found online for free, and they are completely legal. For example, this article can be found at:http://www.articlearchives.com/environment-natural-resources/land-use/862358-1.html"
5,Great stuff,"I happen to live in CT, where hockey is a big thing, so big, that Dave Zamboni (The lead singer of this band), is the MC for the Bridgeport Soundtigers (Islanders affiliate AHL team). This CD is great! It's got the catchy tune ""Hockey Monkey"", which is just a funny song. If you like hockey, then you will LOVE this CD!"
5,Better Than The Beatles (at hockey songs),"WOW!!! I knew that title would get your attention. The Beatles never wrote songs about hockey so the title is correct. These guys really are incredible. Their sense of melody, musicianship, humor and the fact that they make songs about hockey better than most junk that comes out from non hockey bands is INCREDIBLE! If you like hockey, you will love these guys. If you like music, you need to listen to this band and then you may find yourself heading out to the rink soon after. GREAT STUFF!!!"
3,Not the best...,"I've been a fan of Diamanda's work for quite a while. I must admit this isn't the best Diamanda Galas album, but it does have some wonderful songs. The Singer consists of performences performed on the Judgement Day tour, however, if you can find a copy of the Judgement Day VHS you'll find a better example her amazing work. This album is not as beautiful as Malediction and Prayer but is still a good example of her work with her voice and her piano. The best tracks include Gloomy Sunday and Judgement Day!"
5,dementoid must-have,great mix of odd-ball tunes; must-have for demento show fans; great music for people who enjoy music removed from the mainstream.
4,Demento Country Western Style,"A good way to think of this disc is to think of the kind of songs Dr. Demento would play if he was having a Country Western themed show. What you get is 18 songs, mostly novelty or comedic in nature, performed by by country stars or musical satirists. Some of the songs are funny, some chuckle, but no giant winners on this disc. But then again this collection is form before we had the whole Blue Collar Comedy revival of the last 10 years or so. So if you are looking for some mild Country style humorous songs, then this may be for you. Otherwise you may want to pass."
1,Very poor quality,"I purchased this set on Sept 2006 and while it ""was"" a beautiful set, it is beautiful no longer. Over the past two years, the pattern has completely worn off half the pieces. The silver rings at the top of the handles have broken on several pieces with a few having been lost, leaving me with an ugly incomplete piece. Two pieces have handles that have cracked.These have never been in a dishwasher and while used regularly, have never been abused.I am extremely disappointed with this set and after reading reviews on similar styles of flatware from Pfalzgraff, it appears they have serious production problems with these sets.I do NOT recommend you buy this or similarly made flatware items from Pfalzgraff."
3,"Brillant display, crappy software, not enough memory","I've been using the Archos 105 for almost 6 months now. The tiny display is brilliant. The quality is SO GOOD YOU CAN WATCH A MOVIE on it. However there is little else positive to say. Battery life is OK, not enough memory, there should be add on memeory. The interface is so 2003 it is sad.It is as if there was an innovation budget and the display got all the effort and thought. Look at this display and then imagine how good the iPhone will be when and if Apple switches to an OLED."
2,Not a Good Choice for Audiobooks,"I listen to audiobooks often, so my husband gave me this device because it had the bookmarking and other capabilities recommended by the audiobook provider I use. It worked fine for the first few books, then suddenly stopped syncing them. I had a terrible time reaching anyone at Archos; their contact link didn't work, and their phones are rarely answered. I get a message telling when their business hours are, and then it hangs up--even if it's during their business hours. When I finally did reach someone, he was unable to help, so he had me return the device for a replacement. The second one worked fine for the first few books and then did exactly the same thing as the first one. We're going to purchase a different mp3 player."
2,Not that universal...,"Doesn't function properly with old Pioneer cable box. Also, doesn't function properly with Phillips TV/VCR combo, treating it more like VCR and not operating functions like selecting captions inside the menu. More like basic remote that costs much less.. My old Sony remote worked better..."
4,Book contains no info on OpenBSD OS and its dual stack,"I'm reading both this book and _IPv6 Essentials, 2nd Ed._Both of these books are good. but those interested inIPv6 for OpenBSD will probably find IPv6 Essentials moreuseful since this book does not mention OpenBSD at all, whereas the Essentials bookdescribes details of enabling optional ip6 features in OpenBSD (OpenBSD comes withboth ip4 and ip6 enabled by default) and even mentions OpenBSDin the index.Proofreading at OReilly is slipping. I have encounteredgrammatical errors in the text that make me wonder ifEnglish is the native language of the proofreader(s).Also, note that O'Reilly appears to have severedall email links to the rest of the world. The email addresses given in OReilly books no longer work,(I tried to send this info to O'Reilly using the email address given in the book but the email bounced.)"
3,Beware! All three reviewers seem to be from Sharper Products,"Rest of (all three) reviewers seem to be from Sharper Products promoting their products. You can tell this by clicking ""View All My Reviews"" link and you'll see they have reviewed only shaprer products giving 5 starts to every product they reviewed. I strongly believe they are somehow connected with Sharper Products and promoting their stuff.PS: I have not used this product so I am giving it neutral rating. Intent of this post is to make others aware of what is going on. Thanks!"
5,Pill & Fuzz Free,"I bought this shaver recently from [...] (I see it's cheaper here, but I had a gift card to use up). Anyway, I think this shaver is great! I had a battery operated one for years that finally died. I bought this one to replace it. This definitely gets rid of ALL the fuzz. I did have to rub over the same spot a couple of times to get it all, but I was shocked at how much better the electric one works than my battery operated one. This shaver takes either batteries or an adapter cord that comes with it. Definitely use the cord - it's much stronger that way. I don't know why people who have never even bought this are posting reviews, but for me - I'd buy it again! If you look at the customer pictures - (I'll post some pictures in a minute) of a pair of my kids mittens. The amount of lint/fuzz/pills it removed is awesome. Almost like buying a new mitten [...]"
1,poor,"The shaver didn't shaver lint pills off of clothes, very dissatiffied. I tried to return back to the company, and they were going to charge me 30% restocking fee. I wished I had not bought from them. Make sure you know what you want before buying from them, I was very unhappy."
5,Looked exclusively,I was hoping to find a product like this when I searched Amazon. I was extremely impressed with the quality!
1,smartek ST-25 Deluxe Clothes Shaver,I have had one of these (similar) for years and years and they were great. This one sucks period! Not much more to say except I would never recommend it.
2,Absolutely LOVED IT... until it stopped working,"I loved this device... until it stopped working consistently. It's far better to have an electric device for clothing shaving than the battery powered ones. This Smartek was fabulous, but after using about 8 or 9 times it stopped working consistantly. Now I have to shake & knock it before it works. I looked to return it but am just out of the return period. My bad. Great when it works."
4,"smartek fabric shaver - better than ""as seen on tv""",This fabric shaver is middle of the road pricewise and works very well. it's much more durable than those little ones for four bucks that last maybe two times then don't work anymore. I have only used it twice so far but it works great
4,So far so good,"It serves the purpose annd I have been able to save money by not repurchasing new sweaters, Blades need to be a little sharper with a Replacement Set."
2,Motor stopped working after only 3 uses...,"Although the first item I shaved looked awesome, the AC adapter plug was very loose and after only 3 uses the motor no longer runs. I haven't tried using batteries, but I bought a plug in version to avoid batteries in the first place. Very disappointing!"
3,Pretty Good...,"I think this book is pretty good, though a little unrealistic. the book is about a second grade teacher who falls for the father of one of her students. The dad is an ex pro football player and has his sights set on this intriguing woman from the first time they meet. The little boy is also instrumental in hooking the two up. You immediately fall in love with the child and his persistence in getting his dad and teacher together. Though the storyline is interesting, the author failed to address an important concern- the conflict of interest between teaching a student and dating his parent."
3,Slow,"This book's theme was okay, but it is so slow. I was like ok lets get to the meat of the meal. What I really thought the book was about it really wasn't; there wasn't enough drama to sooth my appetite.The romance part was even weak. I was going to give the book 4 stars, but I bumped it down to 3. Don't rush to purchase, do what did and get it from the library.Later!!"
2,Not so great sequel,"I loved the Sterkarm handshake- in fact it is one of my favorite books. However, this sequel is not nearly as good. More of a romance novel, this book lacks the impact and realness of the first book. Stick to the Sterkarm Handshake and avoid this book!"
4,Very good book,"I believe this is a wonderful book and it has been a tremendous help in my line of work as a dancer. The book is beautiful and it provides everything you want to know about the true biz of dancing. I read it often just to remind myself that I am an actress and not just a stripper. Great info on how to be a pro and not a hussler, also love the pix. It is inspiring and down right uplifting. From a dancer of 10 yrs in showbiz."
1,Not sure why this keeps getting 5 stars,"Pretty bad. A lot of pictures, not much else unfortunately. I am not sure why this keeps getting 5 stars. I guess some readers have different opinions on what comprises of quality material that attempts to describe an art."
2,more photos than text,"I bought the book because of the good reviews but I was very disappointed. It does give some advice on the business but 70% of the book consists of Ms Mirat in various poses and (absence of)costumes. There was very little I could use,and I am a dancer,although not in the same field. I would have liked more information on make-up,hairstyles,walking,poses,dance routines,whatever...There was very little of this."
1,I don't understand all these 5 star reviews!,"This book sucks! I really hate to think that this book has provided anyone with insight on the art of exotic dance, or being sexy! It is mostly pictures, some unclear and even unprofessional looking. The terrible spelling errors and lack of any real information is just embarrassing for the ""author"". I think this book, while advertised as a way to improve your exotic dancing, etc, is nothing more than a more expensive issue of Playboy. Save your money and find another resource."
1,The Revolution Betrayed,"Stalin despite the flattering summary above was not a great Marxist thinker. Stalin not only missed the basic ideology of Marxism but is also a very poor writer, who's works at best are boring, inacurate and documents of lies. If you want to read a great Marxist writer I would suggest Lenin or Trotsky. Put these works where they belong, in the fire along with Mein Kampf and anything in favour of George Bush."
1,Wrapped in bubble wrap?,"I bought this because it was described as ""oiled rosewood"". The handle is rough and not at all nice looking or feeling. I have a 10"" chef's knife by this maker which is beautiful Be sure to order LamsonSharp ""Silver"" not ""rosewood"". Packaging was as if they had it stuck in the back of the warehouse- rolled in bubble wrap- no box. I'm sorry, but a knife that costs 80 bucks regularly needs to have a box. Returned- my first ever Amazon return in over 5 years."
3,It has flare problem,"I bought this filter to be used with my Nikkor 17-55mm f2.8.When I shot into light, there are flares or ghostings in my images. At first I thought it might be the lens causing the problem, but the flares/ghosting disappeared once I took the filter off. I tested it against various other light source and confirmed that this filter has flares/ghosting problems.It is a bit disappointing for a $80 or so filter to have this problem.Set the aside the flare/ghosting problem aside this is a solidly build filter."
5,Good looking lights,"Nice looking plastic lights, used them in a classic car build in order to add interior lighting. Can't say anything bad about them, not LED so looks normal in an old car."
2,Very Poorly Written.,"While the Tawni Gomes story is very inspiring, the book is very poorly written. It appears that this book was never proof-read before being published. There is a difference between writing in a conversational style and just being careless. For example this sentence appears on page 105, ""After you race or have a long run, it's a good idea to either take a day off, but if you want to do something, water fitness or a stationary bike are good ways of giving your legs a breather."" Probably the word ""either"" should have been deleted. The book is full of other equally sloppy examples. This kind of error might be acceptable on an internet page or in some other free media. It is not tolerable in a twenty dollar book. I will certainly avoid any other books published by Paper Chase Press."
2,AKA Make the Connection II,"Tawni has taken a lot of her ideas from a book called Make the Connection by Bob Greene. He is a trained exercise scientist and a better source for this information. In the book Make the Connection, you can read abot Oprah's hard climb to physical fitness and you can read these fitness ideas in their original context. Its a better read and more inspirational (after all, its what originally got Tawni out the door)."
5,A moment of empowerment!,Tawni's book was an all night experience. I couldn't put it down. I was crying and I was laughing. I truly feel there is a little part of all of us in Tawni's story and most of all in her struggle. Tawni's inspiration led me to 'taking the baby steps' to complete my first marathon and I'm still struggling with the weight issues. I know everyone who has ever struggled with these issues will relate to her book. Her motto of Baby Steps and No-More-Excuses will help everyone. Great work Tawni.
5,Inspiring! A real person to give us all hope.,I loved this book! I really related to Tawni's story and that of the Connectors' stories that were profiled. I'm sick of reading about famous people that have chefs and personal trainers. I am a working mom and have to juggle all of my priorities and have often chosen to let my health take a back seat. NO MORE! After reading Tawni's book I feel there really is NO EXCUSE. I have started my baby step and moved myself up on my to-do list. Thank you Tawni!
2,NOT ENOUGH MEAT,I looked forward to reading this book but was extremely disappointed with the content. I felt that it was just a rehash of many diet/exercise books I have read in the past. I have read Tawni's daily thoughts and found them very inspirational. I was looking for more of that inspiration in her book. I just didn't find it.
5,I'd give it 10 stars if I could!,"Holy mackerel, these things are awesome! Stows so very conveniently away and works very intelligently, locking in place wherever decide to stop it, rolling back up with just a tug. Have only had a couple of times where it decided to tangle up a touch when recoiling, but with almost no effort was able to pull back out and start over, coiling up properly like does all the other times. Buy a handful and have 'em in car, at computer, stereo - they're so inexpensive but so awesome!"
3,3.5mm retractable stereo cable,"Used this about a month so far. OK quality. No issues whatsoever with the retractable feature. No static with connections at first. Now (a few weeks later) there are signs of internal wire breakage. The wire appears to be too thin...starting to get static in certain positions. Suspect that in the near future this cable will be useless. It appears to be too much of a compromise making the wire so thin and pliable allowing it to retract easily, that it easily breaks at stress points (for me, the portion of the cable right behind jack). Overall, nice concept, but the wire is a little too frail to hold up for normal use."
1,Waste of your Money.,I have purchased two of these myself. Both failed. I also know others with the same cable. They also failed.This item is worthless unless you are in a pinch. Even for the 3ish dollars I paid per cable they still are a waste of money.
4,Nice retractable cable,"Works as advertised and delivers good sound quality. I personally love the fact it is retractable, which makes it nice for use in my truck."
2,Broke after about a year,"Cable worked well for about a year and then we had problems with sound only coming out through one channel, and you had to fiddle with the fit of the cable in the phone jack and pray for the best. This worked for a while but now it has gotten to a point that it almost never works right.I know it's not a problem with the phone or my system because other cables don't have this problem. YMMV, but I expected better longevity.Also, the cable is almost a little too short. The length was okay for my situation, but you should consider that before purchasing."
4,very useful,"These are very useful so you don't have long cords going from mp3s to speakers or headphones. I have several of these so I can have one in every location I might need them, and have bought more so my family can have multiple also. Good purchase."
2,Short Life Span,"Lasted for a little more than 1 year. Eventually, it stopped playing out of the left speakers, making it quite frustrating to listen to music."
5,lovin it,"I'm here to let you know; everything you are hoping this product to be, it is. The cord is healthfully long and the sound quality is very good. The retractable cord makes it very convenient to keep out of the way."
1,Doesn't Work,"Maybe I got a bad one but when I attempted to use this cable for the first time it did not work. I had to wriggle the cord or hold my MP3 player in an awkward position in order to get the sound to come out of the speakers. And when the sound finally came out, the quality was very poor. I do like the fact that it is retractable which will keep my car a little neater but I am ordering a different one today."
2,Flimsy,"Flimsy. Thin cord, small connectors, and very unreliable retraction mechanism. You get what you pay for."
4,Good product,"Serves it's purpose. I'm using it to connect my Zune to my car stereo system and it comes in handy so I don't have a large wire running down the front of my console. Only flaw is to retract it you have to pull it out all the way then pull it again to wind it back. Minor flaw, but I could also be doing something wrong."
1,"Good idea, but flimsy cord and unreliable retraction","I love the idea of a retractable cable, but this cord is so flimsy and the retraction mechanism so iffy that I managed to permanantly break it within 30 minutes of having opened it (I was stretching it out to see how long it was, the little center piece moved to the side, and in the process of fixing it... I unraveled the cord altogether.) I'm a techie, usually very easy on my equipment. If I broke it so quickly, I have little confidence in this product. Get something sturdier if you plan to use it often."
3,Nice convenient product,"This product is pretty good. You absolutely DO have to be careful not to tangle the cable inside the hub. I have cautioned my kids how to use it. After all, the fact that it winds up within itself, leaving it just 4"" or so, is the main reason I bought it. I was a bit disappointed when, as I was awaiting delivery, I saw the exact same product in a department store for about $2 less..."
3,Not bad but inconsistent,not sure what issue is here. but I put one in my wifes BMW 335 Ci convertible and it makes a horrible background noise. That was not there before.I put in my Buick Enclave and it works flawlessly.Not sure where the interference is coming from.
1,Don't buy this product,I recently purchased this - very excited to use it in my car - and wish I'd kept the packaging before testing it because otherwise I'd return it because the sound quality is AWFUL! This is one of those purchases I regret making. I advise others not to make the same mistake.
2,Lasts about a year,"I have used this cable on and off for about a year and a half -- but there were at least six months in the middle there where I had misplaced it and didn't use it at all. It recently went bad -- lost one of the stereo channels. It now connects one channel only.The problem is in the contacts. If I bend the cable near one of the ends I can get the other channel to come in intermittently. Note that I didn't ever fiddle with the ends during normal use. I have only tried the bending game to get the lost channel to come in.If you think the price is worth about 1 year of use, this is the cable you want to get. It certainly is convenient and I like the retractable feature a lot. Just wish it would have lasted longer."
1,Doesn't work with 1st Gen iPhone,"The plug does not fit into a 1st generation iPhone. There is a recessed hole in these models, and the plug cannot be inserted deep enough to make a contact."
1,"Only 2.5 feet, not 6 feet!","Amazon should correct this product description. It says, ""Measures 6 feet long fully extended."" But this is not true!!!The cable only measures 2.5 feet when fully extended and it says so right on the box.I ordered this brand because I was lead to believe it was longer than other brands.Amazon - please correct the product description. Thank you."
1,Dead after less than two years of moderate use.,The title pretty much says it. I didn't move it around it all. All I did was plug it in and out about once a day. Such lack of durability is not acceptable regardless of cost.
1,Disappointing,"It easily gets tangles up around the wind up mechanism. You can untangle it (it only looks impossible), but it takes care and patience. After I got this, the input plug on my Sony headphones failed. I suspect the cable jack is too long and pushed through, breaking the internal stop."
4,Good Product,"It's a thin cord, but it seems like the best one out there for the cost. It sounds great with my car speakers, and I love that I can leave it in the car plugged in without the cord getting stepped on!!!"
2,worked well for a while,"I bought this about 18 months ago was happy with it until about 3 months ago when it began to cut out some of the sound. It was heavily distorted through the audio system. This happened with 2 ipods, 1 iphone and 2 different cars, so I do feel this problem to be in the cable. It did perform well for those 15 months, but considering it only sat in my car, in shade, I feel I should have gotten more time out of it. That is why I only gave it a 2 star, not a 3."
4,Handy little thing!,"It's a tiny little thing but it works great for connecting my iPod to my car stereo. And best of all, when done it retracts so I can easily store it in the console, thus not being an attraction to car thieves. So far it has held up great to repeated retracting because my friends can't keep from playing with it."
5,Works like a charm,"I purchased this cable so I can listen to my MP3 player in my van. Terrestrial radio is full of commercials and I can not stand Sirius anymore, they play the same songs over and over again just like free radio. So I downloaded my favorite songs on my Sansa view. I plug my MP3 into my aux jack in my van with this cable and it works perfect! I like that it is retractable so I do not have to have wires hanging around and getting in the way. Great price, too!"
2,"Did what it was made to do, until it broke...","I really liked the retractable cable. When I wasn't using it, i would just retract it and throw it in my cup holder.After a few weeks of using it (also after a few yanks from my friends in the backseat pulling it too far) the end that was plugged into my head unit broke! the wire or whatever became loose and no longer streamed my music from my ipod in.Although it was yanked out a couple of times, i expected it to last longer and don't recommend this product. I would suggest getting a regular 3 foot cable with reinforced ends (look up ""Cables To Go"" on amazon, my new ones are similar to this. 3 foot is plenty for inside your car and to let your friends choose songs from the backseat)"
2,Not all that great.,This product will work for a quick fix or until you can find something better. The quality of the product is extremely poor. The cord will stretch out within a few uses. The retractable part keeps tangling and never retracts back to normal right away. I have been able to untangle the cord and try to get it to retract somewhat. I didn't expect this to be a great product because it only cost about 6bucks. But I want it to work properly with out having to spend time untangling it each time I use it!
5,"Nice, handy cord","I use this in my car to connect Ipod/mp3 players to my head unit. I like the retractable feature because when I'm not using it, I can store it in my center console without it getting all tangled up."
4,So Far So Good,I've had this a while now and connect it to my Bose Portable SoundDock since I use an Android Phone. I find a lot of these retractable items break and so far after about 6 months of regular use have had no issues.
1,Ok but way too short,Good idea but they could have made it a couple of feet longer. Not suitable for me at this length
1,Poor Quality,"Although the concept is a good one, the wiring must be bad quality, because it allows interference and any movement causes the line to make a horrible scratching sound in my speakers. I tested different brand of 3.5mm cable to ensure it wasn't my stereo and it worked great. This cable was a waste of my money."
1,Very bad quality,"Pros:RetractableCons:Very bad quality sound, I used this to connect my car stereo to my ipod, and the sound quality is very bad! I used another cable and it was fine, this is not worth even 1$"
3,retracting gets tangled sometimes,"This is a male to male patch 3.5mm cable - ostensibly to connect anything with an earphone jack to anything with a headphone input. The reason to buy this is the retracting mechanism, but that mechanism gets tangled sometimes. You have to pull both ends out evenly (with the center part staying in the middle of the span). You cannot pull from one side only - it will get tangled and jam."
2,Cheaply made,"I bought mine about three years ago and until recently rarely used it. After a few months of consistently using it, it makes my IPod music scratchy, because, I suspect, Scosche put bad solder joints on the connections. I will not buy Scosche again."
2,Works for awhile,"This cable was perfect for exactly two weeks. Love the retractablity and the compact size. Sound was okay, too. I was using it in my car's aux jack for my 25 minute commute to work. Was. It died sometime between this morning's drive and this afternoon's. By 'died' I mean the sound now cuts out in that weird, digital way, and you have to bend the one end sideways to get it to be okay. Not conducive to safe driving. Don't buy. You get what you pay for."
2,Cheap like the price,"I loved that this was a retractable cord so that it would add to the mess and disorder of my car. Well, it soon just stopped retracting properly. This cord is cheap in price and cheap in quality. It stopped working really quickly. I actually had this cord and my ipod headphones cord die at pretty much the same time - so I thought my ipod had broke, not the cords! I thought the little ipod hole for the plug had busted somehow, and replaced the ipod. Well, soon to find out it was this stupid cord, not my ipod! What a waste! I ended up purchasing a more expensive cord that was not retractable, and the sound is so much better and it has lasted triple the time of this one. I do not recommend this cord."
4,"great cable, lasted 1 year","I love this cable, the retractability makes it so convenient in the car with my ipod! The end started fraying from me yanking on it so much I guess, so it only lasted a year and I have to buy a new one now, but it was so inexpensive that I don't mind. My husband has one too and the retractability died about 6 months ago, so it's just like a regular cord for him. So it's not built to last, but it works great as long as it's working and it's cheap :)"
3,Lasted 5 months..,I received this product and really enjoyed it... until the sound quality started to get worse and then the cord stopped working all together. I've only been able to gently use this for 5 months. I wish it lasted longer.
2,not that good,"this product is not that good , it is cheap quality , I found some problems with cable retracting , sometimes ( actually a lot of times ) this cable just get stuck and don't return to it place easy"
1,Terrible Product or Maybe I was Unlucky...,Out of the box the cable was not working properly.. looks like a low quality product. I do not recommend this product at all.
1,Interference Problems,This cable is ultra thin and must not be shielded well. If I can't find the perfect spot to put my Ipod within the 2 foot circumference of the cable - then I get a ton of interference. Even when I can find a good spot there is still some interference occasionally. I have another cable (non-retractable) that is only a foot long that works just fine - so I know the interference has something to do with this cable.
2,"Too short, Retraction Flaky","The cable is too short and after a couple of months, the cable is now entangled in the retraction unit. Sound quality OK. 2.5 feet seems like a lot, but it's not when used a replacement for my laptop headphone cable."
3,It's decent,"I got this to use in my car. I works pretty well, I like that is retracts. Sometimes it doesn't work that well and you have to move it to get the best clarity, but it does the job."
4,Did the job,It does what it says :)It also works perfect for my car since the Aux cable is in the top part of the dash.
1,Absolute garbage,"First of all, when I ordered this item the image showed it was WHITE not black. I ordered this specifically to match my white iPhone. Not only that the thing fell apart as I was taking it out of the box. I will be returning this garbage and getting my $5.00 back. Last time I ever purchase a Scosche product!"
1,"Absolute garbage, spend a few more bucks","This cable broke into pieces as soon as the package was opened. I understand products can fail sometimes, but there isn't even anything in the design that would hold it together. I guarantee, if you use it carefully, it will still break at some point. Now it's just a cable, and it's going back ASAP."
1,Save Your Money,"After a few months, the cord quits. If you're using this for your car as I do every day; this itemBelkin iPhone Mini Stereo Cable with Tie 3.5MM Stereo M/Mworks well in my 2008 Kia Spectra.I just hook up my smart phone to it and drive."
3,There's a better choice...,"Not horrible but I bought it at the same time as I bought a much better similar product-Cables Unlimited Zip-Linq Male/Male Retractable 3.5mm Stereo Cable.The Cables Unlimited one is much sturdier and a little longer. After using the two, it seems that the Scosche (this product) does not expand and retract as fluidly as the cables 2 go one. I feel like I'm going to break the Scosche one every time I use it. Also, the Scosche one is extreeemely short and I found the Cables Unlimited one to be a much more practical size, especially considering they retract to the same size anyway.I'd definetely recommend the CablesUnlimited one. I bought both. Learn from me."
3,great product for 5 months,"I purchased this item in August of 2007 about 5 months ago. The porduct works great and clarity is equal to if not better than a CD. After 5 months of picking up my ipod(and retracting the cable) while driving to change the song, ect., the cord no longer has a strong connection. The cable that is connected to the tip, which inserts into my ipod headphone jack, has loosened and it no longer works. The fragile cord is not strong enough or durable enough to be part of a retractable device. I recommend this product if you do not want messy cables in your car, however you won't get a very long use from this product(5 months), thus the three stars. If the cord was thicker and not as fragile(somehow still making it retractable) then the product would be flawless."
2,okay for a couple of months,"this worked well for a couple of months, reducing cable clutter in my car. The retractor works fine too, sometimes it takes some patience to retract the whole thing, cause it stops sometimes. Also, the audio connection became really bad, the sound keeps going in and out and I've have to shake the cable around after rough road or just turing."
2,This is not a 6' cord,If you are looking to attach something that is 2' away then this product is for you. The ad is misleading as this cord retracts to a couple of feet. Better off saving your money and buying a regular cord.
2,Good concept but...,"The concept is great, I use it in my car with my mp3 player and mp3 jack on my car. But after about a 2 weeks I kept having to adjust the cord in the mp3 player and jack. If it wasn't turned around a certain way audio only came out of one speaker. I switched back to just my regular 3.5mm cable and all those problems instantly stopped. Not sure if I got a defective item, but I can't recommend it."
2,Flimsy spring covering,"The retractor spring on this cable is covered with plastic, but the first time I unwound the cable, the plastic broke. Now it is impossible to retract the cable."
5,Nice adapter,This device does what it is supposed to do and for a good price. The retracting cord is a nice feature.
2,Subpar Audio Quality,"I bought this cable so that I wouldn't have to carry the Griffin cable that I got for free when I bought my iPhone from AT&T back and forth between my car and the Bose Wave Radio I use to listen to my iPhone in the house. The difference in sound quality is noticeably different. This Scosche sounds pretty terrible. I have to crank up the volume to hear it, and the tonal quality suffers a little. I do like the retractability, but the cable is so thin it feels like I could cut through it with my fingernails, and, as I said, the audio quality leaves a lot to be desired. I'd go with a different brand, like Griffin, which I know is better (though it lacks the spring-loaded retracter) or Belkin, which I assume is better, but can't say from experience."
2,Not worth it,"I bought this item earlier this year to use with my Nokia N95. To get the best sound, I had to put my phone on the car charger or else leave it half plugged in. I wanted it because of the convenient retractable cord. But now I am already in need of another cord, so its not worth buying."
2,garbage,"The retractor is garbage... the cable too, seems to be the same. Granted, you get what you pay for, but I've had random static and unexpected pauses from my ipod due to the shoddy connection this cable makes. I didn't expect the retractor to be top of the line by any means, but the cable should work."
1,Does Not Fit Original iPhone,"I just recently got a new stereo system and was delighted when it came with an auxiliary port. After much debate I settled on this 3.5mm cord. After receiving it, I was less than thrilled to see that it didn't fit the original iphone. I assume it works with everything else."
4,Wire is thin enough.,"Product is as advertised. Wire is thin so it can go through cracks (which is want I was looking for). The length could be longer, but it's good enough."
1,Don't Buy.,Plugged it from my car to my iPod and as soon as I hit play I got music with no lyrics. I then preceded to fiddle with the cord and got a scratching sounds from the horrible connection.
4,Pratical and cheap,"Good quality and performance for the price. if you are looking for a good and cheap aux cable this is a good option. The only thing is that you need to be careful when you use it, is not unbreakable."
2,Good while it lasted.,I got maybe 1 month of daily use out of this before it started acting up and then it was a quick road to the garbage can. If you insist on buying this I would go ahead and by a 2nd for a backup for when the first fails.
2,Doesn't Work Well,"I had another not retractable cord which didn't give me any issues. This one however, seems to be very particular. It will work as long as there is no sideways pressure on the chord. but if the player is situated so that the chord is being pushed slightly to one side it does not make a good connection. This may be partly due to my player, but the chord I had before worked fine."
3,Lasted about a year,This product lasted about a year before I had to start to shimmy and mess around with the cable position to have both L and R audio. I expect it to die soon and may or may not order it again.
2,Bad sound Quality,This cable does not transfer the firm treble and as well as the bass parts of the music.i am not sure if it was just mine that happen.it could be just the metal parts that goes into the audio jack.retracting functions is good enough to buy at this price.shipping was pretty quick.
2,poor sound quality,The sound quality of this cable is definitely not the best. The bass dropped out and I had to turn the volume up considerably louder than with the previous one I'd ordered.
2,Started to die after eight months,"I bought this cable in Sept. 2009 and it's now July 2010. The connection/sound was good initially, but about two months ago the audio started only coming out of the speakers in the front of my car, instead of front and back speakers. If I jiggle the cord enough, it works intermittently. That tells me the cables aren't connected very well inside the plastic coating. I wouldn't buy this brand again -- not well made."
1,Good for a couple of months,"I use this to play music through my iPhone. They sell these in Wal Mart and I bought one a while back. It's nice and convenient...when it works. It seems like every other month or so it will start to malfunction (it seems as though a connection becomes loose so you start hearing a bunch of wierd high frequency noises and it will allow sound only on one side of the car. I've exchanged between 4-6 of these. I haven't bought a better one yet because I'm quite frugal.I guarantee most, if not all, of the positive reviews on here have only used this thing for a week or so."
1,Scosche,"Dead on arrival, no sound coming through. Didn't open the package until the 30 day policy had passed (my fault). Now I'm stuck with it. Lost $6"
1,very thin but unusable with strong interference while driving,"UPDATE 2010.11.14: Changed from 5 stars to 1. Now I've noticed the cable often receives a high pitched interference from the engine, corresponding with it running and accelerating. Or rare occasions, moving the cable around helped minimize the distortion. I believe this is because the cable is so thin and doesn't have adequate electrical shielding. It's no longer useful in my car!Original Post: I just bought this and was surprised how thin and flat the actual cable was. I connected it to my iphone and the aux input on my car stereo and it sounds fine though!"
2,Bad Quality,Looks like all the accessories i purchased for my iphone from Amazon are useless.This one joins the list of poor products.Very poor quality..i need to hold the input plug in a certain direction for sound to come..Bad stuff
2,Not a terribly bad cable but don't expect it to last long.,"I wouldn't recommend this cable for two reasons:1.) The cable does not always spin right back and it's rather hard to make it do so. My experience was rather random. Sometimes it would, sometimes it wouldn't.2.) The rubber casing began to tear at the end and I have to move the cable all around in order to get it play out of both speakers instead of just one.This time I'm going to go for a more quality / durable solution."
5,Perfect Cable For AUX inputs in the car,"This retractable cable is perfect for connecting ipods, phones, mp3 players, etc to the AUX input on a car. My middle console in the car tends to get super cluttered, so to have a cable which doesn't get tied into knots and make a mess is a huge plus.The sound quality so far as I can discern is great with this cable.The retractor mechanism can tend to get stuck, but has always quickly snapped back into place after I jiggle it for a second.The cable is only 3 feet long, which is perfect for me, but depending on where your AUX input is may not be sufficient, so be aware of what you are buying."
2,Doesn't retract,"The company did a great job senfing the item in a timely fashion, but the first time I used it, it broke! It no longer retracts, what a rip!"
2,Good Until It Breaks For No Reason,"It works the way it's supposed to, but sometimes the cord tangles up a bit.This thing broke after only a few months of use in my car."
2,Doesn't Last Long,This cable is great for about 5 months. After that the cable started to short out at the ends with sound only coming in for the left side. I would buy a beefier cable if you plan on using it daily like I did.
2,Breaks easily,"I had this retractable cable for about 2 weeks before I started having troubles. It wouldn't retract properly after a few uses and then the wire inside broke rendering it useless. It's a great idea, it just doesn't hold up in the long term."
1,Broke quickly,Stay away from this retractable cable. The spring mechanism that enables it to retract broke almost immediately. The cord is fine but the build quality is shoddy. To be expected from something this cheap I suppose. Spend an extra few dollars and buy something better.
4,Great idea.,"Nice little product. I keep this in my car, to plug in my phone to play music. It takes up less space than a regular cord and is not as messy. Works great. Recommended."
1,Stopped working within the first week,"After the first week of using it, it no longer stays extended. I always retracts. I bought this one because I had bought a similar cable and had the same problem with it. I don't think I will buy another retractable cable."
2,Worked well... while it lasted.,"Love the idea of a retractable aux cord. Hated that it broke after 3 weeks with no hope of putting back together. Even though I was very light on it and only kept it in the car, it popped open. Was disappointed that the whole thing was flimsy. Will now go with a Belkin product or other company with better quality."
3,Does the job,"Not too much to say about this. It's a reliable auxiliary cord that can connect a multitude of products. My only complaint is that I thought there was a button on the center-piece that retracted the cables; instead, you have to pull them all the way out and carefully feed them back into the case."
3,Cost Seems Extremely High,"Why would this cost $40.00? I just bought an entire Playmobil farm set for $50.00. This item, while cute, seems extremely overpriced to me and I would not buy it for that reason."
2,Coffee Mug not so great,I ordered two based on the description that the mug keeps the coffee hot and that it is spill proof. The coffee barely comes out of the lid to sip and when I tip it up to even get a drop more of it seeps out of the area where it screws on so it drips down the front of me. It is a very frustrating mug to drink from. The only thing that is good about it is that it is very well insulated and does keep the coffee hot.
2,good mug not so good top,"I loved the mug. The size was just right and it felt good. The problem was the top. I had trouble about every other time to get it on just right, then had to re-try several times. Don't have time for that in the morning. Also the shape of the lid made it very very easy to spill coffee. Which I did several times. The lid did seal tight, but when I went to drink the coffee while sitting at my desk the lid was too wide and a couple of times the coffee would spill. I didn't like that about the lid. I returned it as I could not work with coffee on me. If the lid were shapped better it might just be a perfect mug..."
2,"Good shape, mediocre construction","This was my commute mug for over a year. It fit well in my cupholder, but I don't think it kept the coffee hot for a whole lot longer than my commute (~60 minutes). One day I found out why, when I picked up the mug, and the bottom (with the rubber pad still attached) stayed on the desk. It was weakly spot-welded to the body of the cup and just fell apart one day, revealing that there was no insulating material between the inner and outer walls of the cup. Do yourself a favor and look at the Thermos E5 products. That cup is truly thermal (keeps my coffee drinkably hot for nearly five hours), and has a true uni-directional lid with no handle repositioning. Down side: The stable base also causes it to be too big for some cars (mine won't sit in the bottom of my cup holder, but it does stay put if I ""snug"" into the holder)."
1,Buyer Beware,"I would advise against ordering. I tried to cancel my order immediately upon learning the exorbitant shipping cost, which Amazon said was doable; however the mug arrived anyway and the company is not responding to my requests for a return and refund. There are so many good companies to deal with -- why do business with one that has such disregard for its customers."
5,quality cat bowl,"I would never buy this item at its list price (it's just a cat bowl!), but for the sale price, it totally beats the tupperware the cat was previously drinking out of. It's heavy, so she can't knock it over and spill water all over the kitchen floor. Also, the plant design is fairly plain. Even though it's billed as a holiday cat bowl, it makes a fine all-year cat bowl. If you're looking at this on clearance sale, it's worth it."
5,Great Album,"This compilation is chock full of great songs. ""Nothing Could Stand In Your Way"", ""We Should Be Lovers"", ""Another Man's Gain"", ""It's All Been Done Before"" ... the list goes on and on. He belts them out with a lot of energy yet with clarity and purpose. Great album."
3,Youth tap shoes,The sizing is way off! My daughter is a 4. Ordered the 5 - too tight. Exchanged for the 6 - too loose but keeping. Would prefer to buy in a store but couldn't find.
2,Not comfortable!,"These shoes were very uncomfortable for me. They rubbed and pushed on parts of my feet, making them unwearable. I had to return them and find a more comfortable dancing shoe."
2,WATCH sizing!,"I ordered a 6 wide for my daughter, and they are very small. They are the same size as her children's size 3.5. According the the sizing chart, a 3.5 is the same size as a 5. However, I held these up to the 3.5 and they were exactly the same. Order at least 1 size larger than you need!"
4,Perfect fit! (about a size up),"Luckily, we've gotten dance shoes before, particularly Capezio. They usually run about a size small, so be sure to order a size up from your street shoe size. My daughter is a 1-1.5 girls, but we got the 4 women's and they fit like her size 2 girls dance shoes. The color is a little darker than I expected, but it works for what she needs at her dance school."
2,Shoes are really nice,My granddaughter let out a scream when she saw these and said she loved them!!! How sad was she that they were way to small for her. I ordered a 3 and she wears a size 2 shoe! She couldn't get close to putting her foot in them disappointing!
1,Very Poor Customer Service,"FedEx never delivered the Bug Shield so I went back to AutoParts Way to let them know. They said they would credit the purchase when FedEx got back to them crediting them for their loss. FedEx credited them but then never sent a new Bug Sheild nor have they credited my Amex account to date. I started an inquiry with Amex but that has not been resolved yet. However, Amex credited my account while the inquiry is being processed. Auto Parts Way did everything via email with this. My biggest complaint with them is they would not ship a replacement even though they got credited for their loss. Not sure I would do business with them again."
3,Its ok but book is bit simplistic,"I think I agree with another review I found on this site (which I should have gone with) that the Signing Times DVD is much better. I've yet to use the quick guide or see the dvd. I did read the book and it's ok, but nothing new if you've read the research on the web about baby signing."
3,"Ok, but a little thin on content.","The book and video are useful in showing the basics, but for the price I'd expect something more in-depth."
4,Very effective resource!!,"This is one book i would recommend to all who plan to use sign language with their babies. It gave specific instructions on how to start (i.e., with milk, more and eat) and what you can expect your child to learn. I like that it showed how babies make their first signs (not how adults do them) since we saw all of it with our daughter.I believe this book is really effective as long as you are also willing to learn. We started teaching our daughter at 7 months and she started signing at 9 months. By 10 months she can use 12 signs and by 13 months she is now able to use 30 signs!!! Need I say more?!!"
5,Great!,The video is amazing and the Quick Reference Guide is very useful. We are starting signing with our infant (7 months) and can already see some response. I strongly recommend it.
3,"Good Information, but very outdated","The book and video are helpful in getting started, but the video is so old and outdated, it's almost unbearable to watch. But, the information and signs are solid. Would have liked a little more information about the process of introducing signs. He focuses on the ""eat"", ""more"" and ""milk"" so much, but doesn't really show you how to use some of the others. It is interesting to see the kids communicate though."
2,Signing is cool -- don't need the video though,I like the sign language. It was pretty great when our 9 month old told me he wanted milk the first time! I don't think you need the video though. You can just start repeating certain signs on your own. Just repeat them a lot and be consistent.The problem we had is that we couldn't get our daycare providers to use the signs. So it seemed like any progress we made got undone by them. He would use the signs with them but they wouldn't recognize it. I can only imagine how that must have been frustrating and confusing for him. So make sure everyone around him is going to use the signs before you start teaching them.
2,You see what you want to see.,"Communication between babies and their parents is more complex than Indian sign language. Parents are often highly delusional in projecting what they want to see and do on their kids. This is a major case in point. Our baby had two or three ""signs"" it used to indicate fear, etc., but quickly she passed on to verbal language. We spent about two weeks investigating ""baby sign language"" and realized its futilty. BTW, we're both child professionals. Baby signing is akin to mood rings."
4,loved it,"im not sure if my admiration for this kit stems from the fact that i love the idea of signing with baby or because this kit is that good.either way, the dvd is more than enough if you can get it on its own.I dont advise to buy the book alone since seeing the instructor acutally making the signs is best, also most of the ideas in the book are repeated on the dvd.either way, its a really helpful kit.. teaching baby to sign is fun and extremely rewarding to both of you."
2,Disappointed,"The book had fewer words than I expected. The drawings were sketches of a man signing. I learned to sign words from the PBS tv show ""Signing Time"" than this book. The ""Signing Time"" show also provides helpful tips to remember the signs, which this book does not provide. Very disappointed."
3,There are better products out there such as the Signing Times video,"I purchased this prior to my son being born and it is geared more toward the parents learning the sign based on an educational video for the parents, a book, and a laminated sign chart. I understood the concept of applying directly but it just hasn't taken off for us and our son is now 11 months old.We purchased Signing Times DVD and it was an INSTANT hit. Not only did Dad and Mom pick up on the signs in the video but it was fun for our son to watch as well. It has made signing fun for us and we all seem to enjoy this way of learning and applying the sign language. The Signing Times video is also much cheaper which is a bonus."
5,sign with your baby complete learning kit,"I took a class with my son for baby signing. This kit helped me give a breif synopsis to my older son and husband. The entire kit is clear, concise and easy to follow. There were important concepts that were not discussed even in the class we took. I highly recommend!"
2,hmm ... Nope,The DVD in this book is very old (ie acid wash jeans anyone?) or maybe the folks are just stuck in the 80s/early 90s. I didnt learn very much from the dvd so you could skip on that. The chart is helpful I suppose but I don't use that either. So there isn't really much I use at all out of this set. hum.
1,Don't bother,"This book is nothing more than telling you things you already know (eg: weather forcasts are not accurate, you cannot predict the stock market ect). The author does not provide any rational, framework or theory for why these things can be fortold other than some vauge references to chaos and some politically correct references to the Santa Fe Institute. A real disappointment; it is written more like a newpaper narrative of what is rather than an analysis of why it is or what it should be. I was particularly dismayed since this book was an Amazon recommendation for business books. They missed the boat on this one."
2,Disappointing survey read,"A generic overview of the forecasting industry, the Fortune Sellers doesn't leave the reader with much strong analytical material. In the technology/sociology/futurist segment Sherden relies too heavily upon individual comments from books/articles that didn't influence many people at all beyond 15 minutes of fame. Doesn't spend enough time on differentiating btw the spheres of self-fulfilling prophecy vs. those that are out of the prognosticators control. Also, uses a strange last chapter to create a management thesis-- what? if I wanted to read organizational design theory I'd select something else."
1,This publisher does not have the right to publish this!,"This publisher does not hold the rights to this book any longer and has been asked repeatedly to stop producing it and selling it, as they are doing so illegally. If you would like to order this book, please order the edition by Sentient Publications, who is the licensed publisher of this work. Thank you."
2,Lost in Holland twice or double dutch,I just wonder was this book written by a dictionary salesperson or prehaps i am just illiterate.
4,decent,"I've had this shoe for about 2 years. love the look, ease, and comfort. but it is starting to fall apart. not sure how long shoes are suppose to last and since i rotate shoe's daily i'm assuming i put less wear on them than typical."
3,I love skechers design but I though they were more confortable,"I bought these par of sckechers and I like their design, that's the reason why I chose them, but I'd never had Skechers before so I thought they were more confortable and not that rigid for everyday use."
3,not very durable,"this is about the 4th pair of skechers ive owned, and quality seems to have gone downhill. I wore the first pair daily for several years and they soles are still in decent shape. I bought the Wynn and another Last march and have rotated between the two. Ive nearly worn through the soles on both, desperately need replacing.The Wynns were very comfortable, look great, made a nice casual shoe i could wear to work. Im still considering buying another pair, but $70 for a shoe that lasts a year is tough to justify for me"
4,Excellent shoe!!,"Very comfortable shoes. Easy to take on and off, due to elastic web at each side. Exterior does scuff somewhat, but can add a unique worn look to shoes."
4,Good Shoes,"These shoes are great overall. You will have to deal with the new shoe stench for a few days before you get used to it. Don't wear white socks and get your shoes wet. It will leave a black stain on your toes. Not too comfortable, workable!"
3,Its looks better on the display then it does in real life.,the image has saturated colors that are stronger then the real product. the shew is nice but its not as nice as it looks in the display. i like the good deal they gave. i got the shew with a small pigmentation so i don't know if that means that theses shews are on discount because there not the highest quality but from an overall look at the show and the way it feels on my foot I'm happy and i don't have strength to deal with sending the show back for it but its a shame that they don't sort out.
5,Fantastic Resource,"I have thoroughly enjoyed going through this book. I have not been able to try everything, but what I have tried works. The book is written so that it is easy to follow. There are hundreds and hundreds of ""recipes"" and tips which can be used to remedy any number of situations around the house/yard/garden. The best thing is that most of the ingredients were already in my kitchen cabinet - at least for the things that I've wanted to try so far. I also appreciate that this book provides alternative methods to the use of hazardous chemicals/pesticides. Additionally, this book provides a wonderful offering of recipes for self-care (pampering) such as lotions and tonics, and hair and skin care. Even if you've never even THOUGHT about making your own ""stuff,"" this book will introduce you to any number of concoctions that you can have fun experimenting with. I highly recommend this book... have fun seeing what works for you!"
5,Great deal!!,I have been looking for Jerry Baker's books at a reasonable price for years. This was a great deal and I was able to share them with my sister who is redoing her back yard. I had friends that raved about how great this guy was.I received a flier for this book and the price was about 7 times as much.
5,Buy this remote,"This remote is great. I have a 27"" Viewsonic HD TV hanging behind my bar. Behind the wall, is the Sony Receiver and the DirecTV Satellite box.The RF works flawlessly, but the IR codes for the DirecTV and Viewsonic were not in the instructions. So, I called support. Within 45 seconds, I'm speaking to a real person (in the US).She upgraded my remote by e-mailing me a tone that I play through my speakers while the remote rests against it. Then, she gives me the codes for my components. BOOM - everything works.I was considering the Logitech Harmony remote with RF that is several hundred bucks, but this does everything I need - plus it has great macro functions. You won't be sorry."
4,Had to program it for our new Direct Tv Reciever,We had to program it for out New Direct TV reciever looked on line to find information on supported or not. Had to call support and have them program it. Great support call. programing we used the speaker phone over the hand set that worked better. only bad thing is support has eastern time slot only 8 hours a day M - F.Product works great Love it good range in a larger house through floors and walls seems to work fine.
4,Works well.... most of the time.,"I've been using the remote for over a month now, and it works really well. I have all of my components under the stairs, right behind the tv, so I'm no more than 10 ft. away when trying to control my components, and I sometimes have to move the remote around to try to get the signal to the wireless receiver. I moved the antennae around and it helped, but I still have dead spots. Not a huge deal, but I was expecting a strong signal because of others experiencing 100ft. range. It could be some electrical interference from being almost directly behind the tv on the other side of the wall.It works with all of my components. Upgrade was quick and easy, unlike the upgrade for my URC-8910, which never fully went through. It works with my Vizio GV42L and also they had a code for my xbox (original). Great product, especially for the price!"
5,"Works like a charm, needs some work though","Hi,I replaced my old One-for-all with this. I have a DirectTV TiVo which is a Satellite/DVR combo, Panasonic DVDPlayer/recorder. I had to manually program only a few keys of the TiVo and DVD Recorder using their original remotes, as these devices were not directly supported. It took an hour to do this, but was worth the effort. I'm now going to operate my MCE PC with it too. The Home Theater mode is awsome! Also the macro key works correctly. The old remote has issues controlling two devices which were 2 feet apart, but this one controls both the devices when I direct it on the carpet. The RF receiver also works very well. I was able to control from a room which is 40 feet away."
3,lousy layout,"this remote works flawlessly, and even allowed me to update it over the pohone for the latest direct tv hddvr device. but the layout of the buttons is seriously flawed. there is no intuitive design, and the buttons are nearly impossible to find by feel unless you look at the remote. for example, the power button is just above the joystick scroll buttons, and one small slipup and you've powered down rather than scrolled up. this would be a perfect remote if only some ergometric design went into it."
1,Worked great until the RF feature quit after 6 months,"The idea is great and the upgrade option works well. They even had upgrade codes for an old Sharp professional series data projector and a new off-brand HDTV I have. But the main feature we bought this for is the RF repeater so that we could operate our equipment inside the cabinet without having the doors open. It worked great for 6 months, then the RF repeater (or maybe the RF transmitter in the remote) stopped working. Now it's just an expensive version of One-for-all's regular IR remote."
3,Mixed Feelings,"The remote (overall seems to work). It was difficult to find codes to work my amplifier, however, the amp is 20 years old (backup amp for whole house system). One for All did respond rapidly, happily and succinctly to my problem. After code uploads (via phone and computer - very easy) were executed the 12th code did operate my system (in the majority). But ... I specifically wanted the remote for the RF capability. I could only get the RF remote to work well at 15 feet and intermittently at 20 feet. I really needed at least 50 feet (I used new batteries and changed the position of the receiver). It is possible my home has too much interference and it does have metal studs in the walls. So the upshot is I returned the remote."
4,"Helpful - limited RF Range, though","This is a great universal remote, particularly because of the help available at the One for All customer support line. I called them twice setting this up and spent very little time on hold. The major limitations are a couple: first, the RF range is small - if you want to control something that the remote can't ""see"", then you will be using the RF functionality of the remote with the supplied IR/RF control box. In my wood/drywall house, the remote will not work from more than about 15 feet away through a couple of walls. This is not what I was hoping for, but perhaps I can extend the range with a better antenna. Second, when you are controlling via RF, you can't hold a button down and thereby continue transmitting the command. You have to keep pressing volume down repeatedly, for example, in order to lower the volume of the amplifier more than one notch."
5,works great,"Literally works from one end of the house to the other, through walls, floors, everything! We were very happy with it."
2,Codes do not handle all functions of device,Two bad things I didn't like about this remote are.1. The preprogrammed codes for devices are missing some critical functions. I was trying to use the remote for my DishPVR and my Tivo and seems like I have to custom program the PVR menu and 30-sec skip. :-S2. The keys layout are not PVR friendly as it seems on the picture.
3,"Great on paper, very limited....","On paper this remote sounds perfect, zillions of codes and ""FULL learning"".It does not have have codes for one of my Mitsubishi vcrs, or my B&K preamp. It will not learn from my Toshiba tv, or the Mitsubishi vcr (either of them). It will learn the B&K.And it runs out of learning memory VERY FAST. It won't learn many commands before you see the MEMFULL ERR message.If your needs are limited, this may be the perfect remote, but it's not up to the task of controlling a full home theater system."
5,remote review,"If you read carefully and then follow the instructions, this universal remote control will prove to be the most handy tool in the room. It handles ALL the components with no problem. I do like this device."
3,Good Cheap Remote,"This remote fills a very small niche and does it well. Inexpensive RF remotes are hard to come by and this one is very fully featured. RF+learning+macros for $30? Wow! I plan on getting a few to control an mp3 player and amplifier in the basement for my whole-house audio system.I really haven't used the remote much yet- none of the codes worked for my new sony receiver and I need to get the codes ""updated"". That or start ""learning"" individual keys. I did find a working code for my older Denon though, so YMMV.If you are interested in other options _without RF_, by far the best ""universal"" remote I have ever used is the Logitech Harmony 676. Lots of folks like the 880, but I like the tactile feedback of rubberized buttons (and cheaper price as well). The Harmony remotes are managed via USB connecting to your computer.Logitech also offers an RF version of the 880 (the 890), but at $260 it is in a different price category than this remote."
2,Battery Monster!,"Product is excellent with new batteries. Then within a couple days of even very limited use it only works if I point it toward the box and with the closet door open, after 3-4 days you need to physically point it within 3-4 feet of the receiver, not quite what a remote with RF should need to do. I would recommend not buying this product and splurging on a better one or setting up your system with a more traditional remote system, not RF. The cost of new AAA batteries and the hassle of them running out so quickly makes this product not worth it to me. No wonder it is so cheap, it WAS too good of a deal."
1,lack of performance,"I needed a remote to control items behind closed cabinet doors. This device needs to be within a couple feet of the door to function. From across the room, it works less than 50% of the time. I wouldn't buy it again."
1,Not as good as I hoped,"I bought this remote control based on high review rank. But I was not as lucky as everybody else. Mine worked only with TWO out of SIX devices. Supplied codes didn't work and I had to spend about 2 hrs trying to set codes manually. Plus the user's manual is not really helpful. So, I had to return it back to Amazon. I guess I'll wait for some other company to come up with something better."
1,piece of junk...would have given neg star rating if it were an option,couldn't program any device. called manufactureer. support sent me new codes and instructions and still didn't work. returned to amazon for a refund and still haven't received refund.
3,Does not have the ability to learn RF commands,"This is good remote, but I bought with the intention of using to control some RF remote lighting I have setup. It is an RF remote, and it is advertised as ""fully learning"", but it CANNOT learn RF commands. The remote will not work for what I need. Now I am stuck returning the remote and losing the shipping costs."
5,love it,"Its everything it promises to do. Perfect for general day to day use of my home theater system. I still use the specific remotes for more advance tasks, such as programming."
4,Great price for a universal remote,"This remote is a good product for most of the time. It just seems that whatever it's controlling, you won't have all the functionality. For example, my Sony dvd player won't fast forward, and there's no other code for the Sony dvd in the manual. I know that this remote is fully programmable via the JP1, but I haven't taken the time to explore it. I'm just happy that I don't have 3 remotes sitting around."
2,"Stylish, but sub-par support and documentation","This goreous remote is likely to fill any need you might have for controlling your entertainment center, replacing all the other remotes in your house. CD, DVD, TV, and cable are handled here, so there's no real problem...No problem, unless your device is older, or special, and requires special programming instructions. This ""learning"" remote fills the need, at least theoretically, but repeated calls to the maker yielded no results. Moreover, the instructions as stated had no effect on my gear, making this purchase costly and annoying. This lack of support is at odds with the broad promises. It's especially frustrating when you consider how well-built and elegant this remote is.Some programmable remotes have an auto-program feature that finds your devices for you without pressing a long series of codes for each device. I wish this remote had a feature somewhat like that, or at least the sort of help that would make this usable."
4,The Beverly War,"Just what is this book? If it's fiction, it's fast paced and entertaining. If it's a true story of what the author has experienced, it's scarey, the story of an ordinary, honest person who's subjected to outrageous violations of her privacy by a vicious Albuquerque Customs Service. Let's hope it's the former case and not the latter. As an expatriate American university professor in Mexico, it's upsetting to believe that this kind of thing is possible in the United States."
2,Bombing Described in a Contextual Vacuum,"This book is not as descriptive as Irving's The Destruction of Dresden. Not enough attention is paid by this book to the fact that we were in a mortal struggle with Nazi Germany, and had to use all means to slow German war production. Dresden, though not an industrial center, was a center of communication. It was the Saxon capital. As for the destruction of cultural treasures, remember the following. After the fall of the Warsaw Uprising, German flame-throwing crews systematically burned all of the libraries and archives of Warsaw. More than a half-million irreplaceable books and manuscripts were lost. The Germans also dynamited architectural treasures such as the Royal Castle in Warsaw. Therefore, although not carried out for this purpose, the destruction of the loveliest of German cities, and its cultural treasures, served as a fitting recompense for the German conduct in Warsaw."
4,Classic Noise,"Beautiful industrial music for beautiful industrial people. TG invented the noisy, grim aesthetic and this is their swan song. ""Weeping"" will stay with you for years."
5,Brilliant,"I was waiting for this one for a long time. ""Fitz"" is brilliant, as usual. And (as usual) he continues to be self-destructive. Having been away from England for 10 years, Fitz returns for his daughter's wedding but ends up helping the police crack open a murder investigation. The episode is truly worthwhile because it is used to highlight the differences between the ""old"" and the ""new"" i.e. the old city vs the new city, the old police department vs the new department, old crime vs new terror threat. The amazing thing is that even though everything has changed, Fitz hasn't. And it is precisely for that reason that he succeeds here also."
3,One last time...,"OK. This is Cracker's last story, and it works hard on getting things set pretty quickly. You miss some old characters but that's the way some of these ""reunion"" last episodes are. The problem is that in the middle of the video it starts to feel like too many things were done to just show one more case, but character development wasn't clear since the middle of the story. It felt more like all the changes you saw in the beginning were slowly erased as they were all getting ""back to the old habits"".To me, it felt so inconclusive. Not the cliffhanger/I-want-to-see-more kind but something disappointing instead. And in the end, it becomes just one more case, not the time to say good-bye to a character or a story you like, but just one last time to see the show."
4,"Again, if you like this series buy it here.","This is a movie adapted from the british tv series, it takes places several years after the series has ended, for the fans of this series it is a must have and as always Amazon has the best price."
3,New terror - old ways,This was a disappointing return by Robbie Coltraine to what was a cracker of a series in its day. The plot was not nearly as interesting as previous episodes and the ending very predictable.
3,Should have paid attention to other reviews!!!!!,"Wow, this is most certainly NOT as good as the previous 3 Cracker DVD's.I should have minded the reviews and not bought it, because it was one long tirade against anything American and even suggests 9/11 was manufactured and we Americans deserved it!!It's a shame to see Robby Coltrane accept such drivel, I guess he needed extra money!I'm throwing my copy in the trash where it belongs, and hope they do not produce any more, if I want to hear American-bashing and USA - bashing I'll watch the daily news (sadly)That's my 2 cents and God Bless America!"
2,The Cracker Crumbles,I was thrilled when I heard a new Cracker was being released. But the propaganda was too much and the mystery too little. I gave it 2 stars for Robbie. He's always great.
1,A punch below the Belt.,"Robbie Coltrane is an amazing actor. He owns Cracker. Everything previous to this was wonderful to watch, but this one is so full of anti American propaganda that it sickened me. Had I known just how anti American it was I would never have purchased it. It felt like a punch below the belt.Addition to first posting (01.26.09):I have had a chance to watch this again since my first review. I think I was in a ugly mood that day. Maybe passing kidney stones or something like that. This is really not as bad as I made it out to be. I like the Cracker series and will watch it again I am sure.Dave Maughan"
1,Crackers,THIS IS ONE CRACKERS THAT I DID NOT LIKE AT ALL. IN FACT I NEVER FINISHED WATCHING IT. ITS NOT AS GOOD AS THE OLD CRACKERS
4,Overview,This book is a very good overview of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason and a very good introduction to Kant's thought.
1,I wish I could give this one no stars.,"I love all things Ninja. From the moment I saw ninjas I wanted to be one. This movie defiles every aspect of ninja coolness. The ninjas are not only evil ,but they are morons. They should have just made this a comedy. Beverly Hills Ninja gives ninjas more credit, and it had better fight scenes. I was doing better choreography when I was ten. The acting is so bad it embarrassed me just watching it. I hope they give ninjas more justice in this fall's Ninja [...] (Looks Awesome!). Avoid this one at all costs. Complete waste of time and money. Weak!"
3,Lots of Action and Blood,I got this because Robert Gant had a role in it. There was a lot of killing and violence and my favorite got it in the end too. I received in on time and excellent condition. If you like this kind of movie you'll love it.
2,Degunking eBay,The seller was great. Shipment was fast and the transaction was good. Unfortunately the Degunking eBay is out of date for todays eBay. There are different comands for working with eBay and Vista. There was some good advice from the book but not enough to work into todays eBay settings.
2,So annoying..,"This flashlight is too much $ for what it does. Yes it has a cool usefull emergency red flashing effect... But you have to wind this thing for a minute to charge it. does it really last 45 minutes like it claims? no. if you wind for one minute and use it for 5 minutes and then leave it alone....next time you use it, it's fully dead. so that 45 minutes of power it claims to have is really false. If you want to use this thing for 45 minutes you better use it right away, otherwise it dies quickly and you have to ""wind"" it every single time to use it. I like those flashlights you shake for a few seconds better, they're less annoying."
1,Download Incomplete,"If you're interested in watching this, buy the DVD. The item being sold in video on demand is only one episode of two and the second is not available. Beyond that, I love watching Jonathon Pryce."
1,Stinks,"Terrible plot that deviates incredibly from the Canon. Nonsensical. Irene Adler is ""the woman"", not a burglar. Definitely not a Napoleon (Josephine) of crime.As for the Irregulars, not a Wiggins in sight. Cleanest bunch of late Victorian/early Edwardian street urchins ever seen. Nice that diversity is exhibited (at least in the presence of a Chinese Irregular called Tea Leaf, who has a backstory that is about 100 years prescient for political correctness -- too bad they have to call the character Tea Leaf -- all the Anglos have real names).If you have $20 and two hours to kill with low expectations, this is for you."
2,Sorry................,"I really wish I could recommend this. There was some novelty to it, and they tried hard. The sets and costumes were first rate, for whatever that is worth. The major problem was the actor chosen to portray Holmes - too old, too soft, too nice, and way too grandfatherly. Totally unbelievable as Holmes. And the Irene Adler problem is also a PROBLEM. Too bad .......... it's fun where it coulda been great fun. ;-("
3,Too tame and childish,"I never could see Jonathan Pryce as Holmes myself but he was the only good thing about this otherwise sterile family drama that seems like it was made for CITV or CBEEBIES. There's absolutely no bloody atmosphere to it.Holmes' trusty Baker Street kids lose their leader when he apparently drowns in the Thames and the victim's sister begins to turn against Holmes claiming that he doesn't really care for them. But he still needs them to carry on working for him since he's in the middle of a difficult case.It's not the best of plots and the acting from the majority of the cast would make the 'actors' in Hollyoaks cringe. Watson barely has anything to do, the stupid slow motion and editing techniques do not fit the context and the music is completely anachronistic, if terribly dull. The production design was pretty though, it has to be said.For Sherlock Holmes fans and very young kids only."
3,Where are the episode titles and descriptions?,"Amazon, where are the episode titles and descriptions for this collection"
4,Auditor Needing To Focus On What's Improtant,"As an internal auditor, I need to find company savings through improved efficiency, effectiveness, and controls. Most of the time, auditors focus on what is wrong (stating the problem) vs. looking for the solution.This book greatly helped me to focus on solutions and get them implemented for my company's benefit. It provided an interesting overview of virtually every process improvement methodology and then case studies/tools on how to get it done.I am thankful to Mr. Berk for saving me the time of researching this concept and rather placing it on a silver platter for me to get quick results."
3,OK basic SI 3132 eSATA board,"This a good card for basic eSATA. It uses Silicon Image 3132 chip as countless others do, and like countless others it under uses its powers. If you need a basic PCI express 2 port eSATA card and like to line SIIG pockets through the HUGE mark up they charge for this simple product, then go ahead and buy it... I know I did."
2,"Disappointing sequel to ""She"" set in the Himalayas","Lovers of ""She"" beware. This follow-up to the classic adventure novel stretches the implausibilities of the original beyond the ""suspension of disbelief"" barrier, and stretches your patience as well. Leo and Holly follow clues to the snowy reaches of central Asia in search of a reincarnated Ayesha. You will feel just as tired as them as you slog your way through this book. Reread ""She"" instead."
4,Genius baby proofing,"This is a must have baby proofing lock. I have a 3 kids all under the age of 4 and have lots of experience with failed baby proofing. Once your kid turns three they can pretty much unlock anything and so this flip lock becomes invaluable. Now, when I don't want to let any of the kids outside I flip the lock and know 100% that no one can sneak outside to pull leaves off the plants in my garden.A quick note is that 1 of the 2 flips locks did finally fall off after one year of use (hence 4 stars out of 5). That being said it was up against some pretty extensive abuse from my door pushing 2 year old and was exposed to Florida west facing sun (which can mess with the glue). Buy this flip lock anyways and be happy!"
3,"Works Great...price point and packaging, not so good.","SO I was surprised when they came. Almost $10.00 each (with shipping) and there was a small package with 4 little zip lock bags (there are NOT 2 per bag) with no instructions. I was a second away from sending them back but we have been struggling to find an effective child lock for our four sliding lanai (we live in Hawaii) doors. I tried one and it worked great so I installed the rest. I pressed them in place, let them set overnight and they held (do not try and test them until they have had time to allow the adhesive to set, they will pop off). You really do need to let the adhesive set overnight for a great seal to the glass. I noticed some folks have said there was no adhesive, either this was a manufacturer error or they did not notice the pink peel off adhesive backing. I only mention this because I almost missed it.SELLER - improve your packaging and work on your price. It is unreasonable for what you get...even if they work."
1,Junk,"This lock was junk. It broke the first time I slid the door open, don't waste you money or get a false sense of security."
3,not thrilled,"works ok to keep your toddler from opening the sliding doors, but thats it, when the lock is in the ""open"" position there is nothing to keep it compleatly vertical so it will drop down some so that you cannot close the door with out something to slide between the doors to hold it up enough to close the door, if only they had drilled a hole in the top to hold it in the ""open"" postion to..... or mabie i put mine in upside down..."
4,What I Was Looking For,"Years ago we had one of these on a sliding glass door. We liked the simplicity and that it wasn't very noticeable (and it is cheap). Worked well for that.Now we're in an old house, and we want to leave our 1st floor windows open but not wide enough for someone to get through (easily, at least). I thought this might work. It does!My only nitpick is the little pin that is supposed to snap in doesn't snap on two of them. I'm looking for a replacement."
4,Sliding glass door saftety lock,"We have a very active 3 year old that started opening the sliding glass door and going outside w/o us knowing. Luckily we have a fenced in yard but still don't want him out unsupervised. So far, after 3 weeks or so, this product is doing great! My only fear is that it is held on w/ a sticky substance & not screwed in. It was a since to install!"
5,Wonderful If you have toddlers!!!!,This is a wonderful safety lock! I bought this so my two year old could not open the back door when ever he pleased! It is very sturdy and durable. Small and simple! you can put it at any height you want which I really liked! Easy to put on too!
4,Used for sliding closet door,"I purchased this to use for our sliding closet door instead to keep our little one out and it's worked out well! It did fall off once because I lifted it incorrectly, which means the adhesive isn't that strong. I was able to adhere it back on. But besides that instance of user error, it has worked fine. In fact, I'm going to purchase a second one!"
2,home defence pastry traps,"I thought the product would work better then it did,the attracter did not seem to attract much of anything,I ended useing a spray to get rid of the pantry bugs I would not recommend this product"
3,Not as effective as baited poison,"It isn't useless, as I have seen a few roaches get trapped in here. However, it doesn't really catch enough to solve the problem. I had much better luck with baited poison."
4,The Tooth Merchant,"Rarely do I reread a book, but this one I've gone over several times. Written in 1973, and filled with news events and personalities of this period, it still has up to date charm, interesting characters, a novel idea and plot and mild sex. The area, Greece, Turkey, and the Caucasus, is a great site for strange adventures. Try it."
5,Great intro to the world of Miranda Sex Garden,"Five wonderful songs seemlessly blended together. 'Lovely Joan' starts out like one of the old english madrigal folk songs that filled their mostly-acapella first album 'Madra'. But then the singing gets louder and louder, then the guitars and violins kick in, changing into something very scary by the end. 'Blue Light' is perhaps the most relaxing, hypnotic, sleep-inducing song ever recorded. It's nearly impossible to listen to without drifting off into a dreamworld. After awhile, the ghostly harmonies at the end get quieter and quieter and suddenly you wake up and notice you are listening to the next song, the much louder 'Iris'. Brilliant songs, perfectly produced."
3,Long time Tifosi,"A good book that covers plenty of the Ferrari models over the years. Has in depth technical details about the cars and their production. I just wish it showed more real pictures of the cars, as most are just artist drawings."
4,"Get it, learn it, do it.","I've been doing web design for years. I'm fluent with CSS, HTML, Flash, and some ColdFusion & Java.I've attempted to learn ASP, but the complexity overwhelmed me.A friend of mine recommended this book.I think it is GREAT for getting you up and going with PHP. I quickly jumped ahead to the MySQL and XML sections and now i have a database up & working on my site. Piece of cake. One problem: They don't tell you how to create the actual database.But its not hard, just say mysql_query( ""CREATE blah blah"" ). They give you the create tag to put in. Otherwise, great, concise, simple source. They explain everything they did in the code. I dunno how this isn't meant for beginners, because i didn't know the first thing about PHP.If you're a beginner CODER, atleast get grounded in C and move to some OOP (Object Oriented Programming) language first. PHP is like ColdFusion had a kid with Basic. :) It's really not hard at all. Learn by example, and get this book."
2,Sams Teach Yourself PHP Second edition,"This book is definately not for the new programmer. It is written in Geek and for a Sams teach yourself not very well presented. I have been using the Sams books for a number of years and not had the difficulty with the comprehension. As a refrence book there is a substantial number of better publications, all of which should be consulted before wasting money on this volume. The volume I have is the Second Edition Published in 2001."
3,I agree with the others,It could be better... But it's got enough if you know programming in any other language to catch on.
1,HOOOOOOORRRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIIBBBBBBBLLLLLE,"I could swear the title was ""Teach Yourself PHP in 24 Hours"". It should be ""Go learn PHP somewhere else, and then read this book otherwise you'll have no clue what's going on"".Get my point? This book is so mal-titled that the author should be arrested for false advertising. If you're a beginner, with no PHP knowledge, don't be fooled by the title, and look elsewhere."
1,Teaches authors they can publish a book (only),"Well, after reading the reviews on EVERY ""no programming needed"" beginner MySQL book available on Amazon.com, I am convinced NONE of them teach a ""beginner"" anything. Commodore language was my ""beginner"" programming, but decided to pick it up again.One thing this book and ALL of these books dont tell you is WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE CODE ONCE YOU WRITE IT? WHERE THE HELL DOES IT GO?After two years of on-and-off study, I still dont know anything, I just have a stack of books rotting in the garage ready for the next 25-cent rummage sale."
5,Pure Anecdotal Goodness,"This book reviews the history of a place that doesn't even exist to the rest of the world. I happen to live half an hour from the Hollow, and it fits the typical description of the ""reputation"" of the people that live there today.If you like reading historical writings, I highly recommend this."
3,Interesting but shallow,"This short book is interesting reading but not a serious history work. Those who live near Sullivan's Hollow have heard the reputation of the place, but if this book is accurate, there is little to the legend."
3,"Great on breakdown, but needed more vocab.","This is a very expensive book for what it is, but because Rapanui is such a rare language, I felt I had to go ahead with this purchase. It's only about 200 pages (which makes this book about a dollar a page!!), and does provide an excellent breakdown of the structure of this beautuful Polynesian language... BUT... there's just not enough vocabulary. For example... I couldn't even find the Rapanui word for 'love'!"
2,Not True To Size,"The product is too small. The product description should have contained the actual dimensions for proper fit...not just 3XL as a size. I wear a size 1XL to 2XL and it didn't fit. Unless you know your way around a sewing machine, needle, thread and Velcro, I wouldn't waste my time."
5,Knee Brace,The knee brace is exactly what I wanted. They are very difficult to find any more and I was very happy to get the one I got. It is extremely helpful to me.
3,A REAL universal remote,"Got this remote 4 weeks ago and it just works great for what I wanted it: Replace my cable, receiver, TV and DVD remote.Two problems however- Very limited memory you can use for learning function (~15 buttons and 2 macros)- Upgrade function only with analog landline phone - no cell phone or newer most office phonesBut as I said, just good enough for what I needed - Especially for that price."
2,I've Had Better Universal Remotes...,"Unfortunately, they are no longer manufactured (Memorex). This was not compatible with several of my components, and the Learning Memory was far too small. Not recommended."
3,Not bad...,"Although I haven't used all the functions on this remote, it is still functional for me. The button layout is only fair and is difficult to switch between this and the Comcast remote that my hands are used to."
2,died in less than 9 months,"nothing amazing as far as a remote control. The macro's are nice, but can be lived without. It was a solid remote for 8 months or so, then buttons started failing one by one until it was impossible to use, and I had to buy a new one. Buyer, beware! one-for-all only offers 90 days limited warranty!"
5,versatile remote for a cheap price,"Very easy to set up, can work with just about anything and eliminates the need for a million remotes."
2,Not recommended,"The remote is disappointing. Although the library of devices is large, each device is only partially covered, if you need to program or reprogram keys you will run out of memory very quickly. The location of ""power"" key is unfortunate, it is placed next to ""up"" key, and very often used mistakenly to turn off a device. LCD panel is useless. Common keys are missing, if you have dvd recorder + hard drive recorder combo, then a bunch of keys with appropriate labels is missing. There is no a dedicated button for disk eject. The thing is big and heavy. I wish it's memory was blank and I was able to program each button for each device manually, but it's not the case. Computer programmable capability requires too many hoops to jump through, it is not for a regular user. I don't recommend this remote."
2,unable to upgrade,"If the codes for your equipment are already in the remote everthing works fine.The learning functions are very convenient.However I was unable to upgrade this after several attempts using different phones (home phone, office phone, pay phone).According to One For All tech support rep they've been having problems with the amazon batch of the remotes.Now I have to send it back to the manufacturer, since amazon will only replace it during the 30 days."
4,All this and upgradable?,"I bought this about a year ago and loved it. I recently purchased a DVD stand alone burner fron Lite-on. Needless to say, the remote did not have a code for any lite-on products.One call to customer support and BAM! they upgrade the thing OVER THE PHONE! It took about 5 min. total. I now have the remote working with the burner, Direct TV, TIVO, etc.Why buy a remote that may be obsolete in 2-3 years when you can upgrade the one you already have?I will never buy a remote from any other company than One 4 All"
2,Can program almost everything....but sucks (batteries),"I was happy to get this remote and was able to program this to replace the 7 I was switching between. The learning feature was great and easy if you follow instructions. However, it has completely drained 2 new sets of batteries on me. I'm getting an avg of 3 days for a new set of batts before it doesn't send the full signal and flashes ""Low Battery"". They were both brand new sets purchased that day. I even changed between Duracell and Energizer. Hmmmm... Also, it is quite large and having the DVR/Tivo/PVR controls on the bottom and toggles on the top can often require 2 hand remoting. It can save space but it's not the most convenient piece of electronics. I'm calling tech support this week to see if I just have a bad unit. I'd rather just get my $25 back."
3,Unable to download codes,"After much online research trying to find a remote to replace two others, I settled here. Perhaps my equipment is just too old but I could never get codes for my Samsung DVD/VCR combo to install, even from the audio file sent by One for All."
4,Don't be confused by price or simplicity,"This is a good deal. This remote does just what it claims. It easily controls teh devices you nedd, so you can rid yourself of all the remotes in your house. I have bought my second one and really love it.For the price, you can forget your concerns."
3,Not for me,"All I wanted was a universal remote to operate my new Magnavox LCD TV. I tried several and they apparently didn't have the proper code. One For All Tech support told me there were only two codes that would work and I would have to buy the URC8910 to get them. When it came, it wouldn't work the TV either as it apparently didn't have the proper codes in it. Then, since this was a ""learning"" remote, I tried to use this feature andwas unsuccessful.Possibly a computer whiz could have gotten it to work, but I couldn't. Also, the unit is very large and heavy, the labels on the buttons are dark gray on black and are very hard to read (even though they light up) and the manual was very confusing. All in all, the unit was overwhelming and intimidating and not very user friendly.I just need to find a simple TV only remote with the proper codes to work my TV."
5,EXCELLENT REMOTE!!,"I did some research and read lots of different reviews. I did not want to spend $100 for a URC. I have had RCA in the past and they never work and are very hard to configure. I got this remote with the hopes of easy setup with lots of functions and it delivered! With in minutes I had both TVs (used AUX for seceond TV), DVD, VCR and receiver programmed. Then took another other hour to re-map key and learn the few function this did not have, eg. up and down channel on the PNP. Highly recommend this remote for the price and functionality it is an excellent value."
3,Godd Remote while it lasted,THE REMOTE WORKED GREAT FOR ABOUT A YEAR.AFTER ABOUT 1 YEAR THE REMOTE DIED AND WOULD NOT WORK.I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS ABOUT THEIR LIFE EXPECTANCY OR I GOT A BAD UNIT.JUST THOUGHT I WOULD PASS ALONG MY EXPERIENCE
2,URC Review,"The remote works great sometimes. If I try to surf, often the remote won't go to the next channel after surfing 5-6 channels. I must wait 4-5 seconds before continuing.Also, the remote will not operate a DirectTV DVR.It did not accept learn codes either.I feel I paid a lot of money for a remote that doesn't do what I really wanted."
2,A little disappointing,"This remote started out looking great. If it wasn't pre-programed, just teach it. But the memory is very small and I was only about 1/2 way through what I wanted and it ""rudely"" informed me it was out of memory."
1,CUSTOMER SUPPORT NONEXISTENT,"I don't know if a FOOL would buy a product from a company that has no support. I tried 330-405-8616 for 35 days--inoperative. I sent emails through the One-4-All website--no response. I was shunted among several Audiovox corporate phone queues--62 minutes worth of ""Your call is very important to us."" I don't know if a FOOL would buy a product from a company that does not support its products."
2,Unable to Upgrade,"Nice remote, nice idea, upgrade didn't work. Tried cell phone, 3 different phones in the house, and a pay phone. They said the fact that I had digital phone made a difference, so I went to the pay phone, that didn't help either. I even tried a second remote from Best Buy...no luck. Check the web site first and make sure the equipment you want to use it with is already programmed into the remote. Learning also not a great option because it cannot store very many learned functions. The component I was trying to get an upgrade for was a DirecTV receiver, D10...forget that one. SPEND A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY ON A LOGITECH HARMONY REMOTE...DON'T BUY THIS ONE FIRST AND END UP NEEDING TO UPGRADE A FEW MONTHS LATER."
5,"Great Remote Control, Excellent Value",This remote control is an excellent value and controls all of the devices in my home theater system. Their customer service is outstanding with quick responses to a phone call and an email. It is not difficult to program with a little practice and they emailed sound files to upgrade the remote with codes for an Oppo DVD player and a Vizio LCD TV. Even controls my DISH satellite box. Used an expensive universal Logitech 880 remote previously and it was a total waste of money. I just ordered another 8910 for a second home theater set up. I highly recommend this One For All Universal Remote.
3,It's OK,"The remote has a lot of built in codes, and worked well, but I stopped using it when I got Harmony 659.Unfortunately, this remote is very bulky and has little memory, which limits the learning function severely. It can be programmed over the phone, but I have not tried that option. I think, more memory for learning IR codes would make it a better product, but after trying Harmony, I am not going back to this remote."
2,Manhunter: The Life and Times of Frank Hamer,I rated this because of factual errors. I could barely get through the first chapter because of some factual mistakes. The author said that Frank had a sister named Estill when in fact that was his brother.
2,Major Problem to Read,"This book is rather dull, although it is a good source to cite when writing a paper."
3,Califonia History,"This book has a great collection of essays. The essays are written by scholars, and people who lived through the different experiences in California History. I highly recommend it."
4,Good for the dedicated!,"I have the Snell Hindi Script and Teach yourself Beginner's Hindi and must say I can read and write Hindi/Devanagari well. Conversation still struggles... This book is concise and well laid out with lots of information good for the beginner. Snell has a tendency to add lots of grammar to the text- important, but difficult to learn as there are a lot of grammar rules. The audio portion is very well done but tends to go too fast, in the sense that the speakers speak in Hindi quickly which can be confusing and frustrating.While not perfect this book is definitely worth purchasing! It takes lots of work and practice to speak Hindi and this book will help you get up and well, maybe not running, but walking!"
3,Difficult Read!!,"This book is difficult to read, unless you are well-versed in traditional Jewish theology. Although the book does a nice job tracing the history of bircas kohanim (priestly blessings""), it is very hard to read and rather boring at times. If you want a more simplistic read on this topic, I would recommend looking elsewhere."
4,Still with me after 45 years,"""A reader"" from Seoul Korea is certainly correct. I read Janvier's Aztec Treasure House in my early 'teens (40 years ago)and have forgotten neither the author nor the book in all that time. Janvier wrote another adventure book about the Sargasso Sea which I did not find as memorable. I read Burrough's Land that Time Forgot at about the same time and found Janvier's superior. Remington's illustrations also stand out."
1,tankless water heater,"The problem with buying a tankless water heater is that the typical home is not set up for installing it, and the amount of work needed is significant. I waited 20 minutes on hold to a Bosch technical help line before giving up and trying to get help by email. I discovered that their technical help is provided only for contractors, who will charge a small fortune to install a tankless water heater. Bosch will not give any help to the buyer if it's more complicated than something like putting on the control knob."
3,"Keeps Coffee Warm, and it doen't leak","I do like this coffee mug for the fact that the coffee stays warm for a long time in the closed position, and it doesn't leak at all. It is very durable, and it has a nice clean look. However, I don't like how slow the coffee comes out. I sometimes like to get a big swig, but cannot without tipping the mug back for a good 5-8 seconds (could be dangerous while driving). The mug is not intended for the dishwasher either. If you like sipping coffee, then this is the travel mug for you. Starbucks sells a really nice (leak-proof) stainless travel mug that I like better, and it's dishwasher safe.- Cheers!"
1,Cold Coffee,"The Wall Street Journal must like their coffee cold.Yes- it doesn't spill- if thats what you are looking for.I have yet to find a mug to keep coffee as hot as my miGo 18 oz mug I bought five years ago. Unfortunately, the handle broke off. From my understanding, miGo doesn't make steel mugs anymore. Too bad. Until I find something that keeps coffee as hot, I need to keep my miGo with no handle."
1,Buyer Beware,"Steer clear of this one! When I learned of the exorbitant shipping fee, I attempted to cancel the order, which Amazon said I could do within 30 minutes. However the mug arrived anyway and the company has ignored my multiple requests to return it. So the box sits unopened in a closet. If you do not want to do business with a company that shows disdain for its customers, buy your mug elsewhere."
4,"""A Fatherly Book For A Beginer""","I was told about this book from my adviser Dr Shaob A Khan. This book is not only remarkable help for the sysnthesis on FPGA, but also a smooth and desciplined guide for the beginers of Verilog. Starting from the very first example of Overheat Alarm system this book keeps the reader in an enviorment where he gradually learns for the best."
1,An attractive title but not attractive contents,"When I start to use FPGA, I desperately searched book list and found this book. Its name sound like it has many tech-tip and expertise in it. But unfortunately I found this book doesn't have anything useful to me. It neither can solve my coding problem for FPGA, nor it can help me to understand more about the difference in design using FPGA compared to ASIC. This book teach me that I must check the table of contents carefully not just attracted by a beautiful title before I buy a book."
4,It is a nice book for a FPGA design with Verilog,"Ken Coffman has 17 years experience with digital design. I have read through whole book in the passed few days. I have almost 5 years FPGA design experience with Nortel Network, Lucent Technologies. Through read this book, there are many interesting sections can enhance my design knowledge. This book covered a lot of fields such as how does using the design tools, How does doing the statistic timing analysis, coding style etc. I think it is a nice book for all FPGA designers."
3,travel watch box,The box is of good quality but doesn't accomodate the bigger style watches of today.
5,Be the Star You Are,"Don't just read this book and then put it away on a shelf. Carry this book around with you--in your pocket, briefcase, purse, backpack, glove compartment--anywhere as long as you can get to it quickly! You just might need it at any point in the day, whenever you hit a moment when your enthusiasm, dedication, or confidence flag. . . whenever you need a gentle lift, a pick-me-up that works better than chocolate! As you read through Brian's tender stories, you will find yourself quoting her, or writing down some of her great one-liners on little pieces of paper to tape around your monitor, on your mirror, or on your refrigerator, for inspiration. You will hear her voice behind you, coaching you onward: YES YOU CAN!"
3,Nice clutch; however misleading description,This clutch is described as having a hidden chain. Neither a chain nor any other kind of strap is provided. Am disappointed about this detail. Will keep bag because I needed it ASAP for a special event.
2,Disappointing Performance,"I wish I had stuck with a CRT Monitor, but I wanted one of the slim new LCD monitors. I found that this one is hard to view. It doesn't scroll well and you have to view from a certain angle to be able to see the screen.A big problem is that the screen flickers, sometimes with different colored hues. The defect makes the monitor hard to view. I'll have to send it back to the manufacturer for repair or replacement."
4,"good price, good condition","The monitor arrived in only a few days. it was packed properly. it was a little dusty, but clean. most importantly it works very well"
1,never did buy it.,"Seller backed out of deal at last minute and then raised the price and sold to someone else. And when I tried to email the guy, he ignored me."
5,Best All Around Reference Book on the War,"I'm very sorry that this book is no longer in print. As a graduate student of history, I refer to it constantly, and I have found it to be the best all around reference book on the Second World War. It combines a day-to-day chronology of the war, biographies of major figures, and lengthy essays on the weapons of war. It is remarkably balanced in its views, and its only significant shortcoming is that the Holocaust is not given adequate treatment."
3,very basic but some useful info,Better AR books out there but was a good grab for the price. Biomechanics section pretty good as well as plenty of basic formulae. Lacking photos.
2,Comfortable but fell apart,"The comfort was great and I thought they fit well. However, they didn't last more than 3 months (indoor use) and they started falling apart."
1,SMALL SIZE,I ORDERED THESE IN AN EXTRA LARGE...WHICH NORMALLY FITS SIZE 10 TO 11 AND MY DAUGHTER WHO WEARS A SIZE 8 TOOK THEM AND THEY FIT HER PERFECTLY....SO U DO THE MATH!
4,ONE OVERLOOKED MERIT NOT MENTIONED IN ANY REVIEW,"Except for 'Revolution' (a 1968 Documentary - NOT! on DVD), 'Skidoo' has actual *real* hippies from the 'heart' of the world of Flower Power & Peace and Love: San Francisco, California. And NOT extras wearing wigs, posing as hippies, as in many Psych-exploitation films of the period like 'Psych-Out, 'The Trip', 'Wild In The Streets, 'Gas-s-s-s' and others. 'Skidoo' has true 'longhairs' - a genuine snapshot of a certain time & place, never to be repeated ever again. So no matter how ""bad"" or ""good"" this movie is, it does have this one distinction that I've never seen mentioned in any of the (extremely contrasting) reviews.P.S. Another overlooked item - in the SINGING! credits at the end of the film, STONE COUNTRY is credited as ""Themselves"". They recorded one very good, self-titled album in Hollywood in 1968 on the RCA label and were (of course) the token group for the movie. Guess which label released the soundtrack of 'Skidoo'? Yes, RCA."
3,Skidoo movie,"Skidoo is a great movie for movie star and TV star nostalgia (acting, comedy, music). There are many amusing and surprising moments. The plot and the continuity of the movie are not strong. It resembles a number of zany movies from the era."
3,"The Only Excuse,It Was The 60's.","What a very bad film. Fairly entertaining in a mind fracturing way. As you stare thinking it cannot get worse. While it does. This is how established Hollywood tried to deal with the 'Easy Rider' generation.And failed. Even Groucho Marx is bad. Old,too old,but still bad. Best seen while drunk. Or perhaps even under LSD."
2,The cast is what makes it watchable,"Skidoo is an infamous Hollywood bomb that sits alongside Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band and Valley of the Dolls as one of the worst movies ever made. It is rivaled in its awfulness only by its sheer bizarreness. However, the biggest problem with Skidoo is that it self-consciously tries so hard to be bizarre that it winds up just being boring. It's really only of interest because of its decidedly unusual cast (including Jackie Gleason, Carol Channing, Frankie Avalon, Cesar Romero, Burgess Meredith, John Phillip Law, Mickey Rooney, Frank Gorshin, Peter Lawford and Groucho Marx) and Harry Nilsson's eccentric music. The movie never becomes more than a morbid curiosity. Yes it's odd, but it simply isn't the demented masterpiece that so many (including me) wish it was."
4,classy for the price.,"finish is nice, assembly good, stays in tune better than expected for the price. cover is easy to use for the boys."
2,Such poor quality I returned the guitar.,"Yes, this guitar package is cheap but sometimes cheap is good and sometimes cheap is just cheap. The finish on this guitar was horrible. The second I took it out of the packaging I knew I wouldn't give this to my daughter for Christmas. I have no idea what the sound quality was so I can't judge that. Shipping was high,[...], then I had to pay [...] to ship it back."
5,great guitar,"I purchased this guitar for my daughter for Christmas. The shipment came quicker than they said it would be here(which for Christmas is great). The guitar is great for a first guitar. It is a good size for kids my daughter is 10 and it is a good size for her to hold. Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase of this guitar."
5,Great,"Works Great (!) so far and I know I have made over 1000 copies. No Problems what-so-ever! Have been using toner saver feature on copier, but have had no issues with blank spots nor had to remove cartridge for toner ""redistributing."" I will be purchasing this cartridge from this seller again."
2,Didn't last long before it jammed,"After just a few weeks, the plastic gears in this jammed and I had to throw it away. Money wasted."
3,ouality of the printing is uneven,i get uneven tone { half side dark the other clear) all the time. but this is cheap one. it is fair.
4,Great value,"I've had no problems with this toner cartridge and the print quality is fine.I've found that with compatible cartridges in general (various sources and for various printers/copiers), occasionally you'll get a lemon. But since the cost of most compatible cartridges are usually less than 1/4 the cost of the name brands, you should still come out well ahead in the long run."
2,Too bulky,The remote is very thick. You need a side picture to see how thick this thing is. The buttons are not comfortable either.
2,Lousy design. I'm displeased.,"Egad! Upon receiving this remote control, I found that it requires four AAA batteries. There was no mention of that requirement in the product description! I concur with the other review writer: the control is top heavy, and I would add poorly designed. It's thick at the top and thin at the bottom, making it unwieldy. I will be returning this monstrosity."
5,Works with TiVo Series 2 DVR and Comcast Adapter,"I have a TiVo Series 2 DVR (can record one-show-at-a-time only) and a Comcast digital adapter box. This items works fine. I purchased my TiVo used, and either lost or didn't receive the IR cable (this is the thing that sends the signal from the TiVo box to the cable box to change the channels). I don't know anything about these things, but this one works, so I'm happy. Simply follow the instructions from TiVo."
2,Not as described....,Specs say it has mini stereo plug ..it does not...won't work with Comcast convertor box...looking closer at picture it has mono plug..guess you can't trust specs....
4,Works as described.,I got this to work on an old Tivo I gave to a friend. Works great! No issues at all. Only thing I would say is it has a flashing red light with is helpful to know angles when setting up but i wish it would have a switch to turn it off once you know it works perfectly. Easily rectified with electrical tape but still...
4,Nice Collection of Disco Music,"I bought this on Amazon in order to have a couple of the songs on this CD available for workouts and just general fun. Interesting thing about the era this music mostly comes from: I am amazed at how many of these songs got me up on the floor but I never knew their names! In those days, I didn't care what the song was called. I just wanted to DANCE DANCE DANCE and dance I did! To rediscover many of those songs and to finally put a name on them is really nice. The CD arrived faster than I expected and was in very good condition."
5,Words to live by,"I love the way this CD makes you feel. No matter how often you listen to it, you always get something new out of it. It seems as if whatever you are going through, good or bad, the chapters helps you through your journey. Very relaxing and soothing to listen to in a quiet, comfortable, place."
1,Personal account,Seems more like merely someone's personal account of their own little missteps in life. The self indulgence sounds more involved than does the information offered in the reading. Didn't appeal to what I would call any higher interests.
3,A very pleasant take on Baroque music,"Unfortunately, pleasant is the best I can say of this recording although it is delightful background music. Take well-known Baroque scores, re-instrument them for a jazz ensemble, add soloists - violin, cello, classical guitar, pennywhistles, records ... , modify the rhythm to a slight swing, ... and you achieve the smooth, lulling sounds of this recording. While the resulting sound is interesting and distinctive baroque, the modifications add no additional depth to the music. It is well worth listening to the recording once or twice but it doesn't standup to the originals in the longrun."
1,"Attractive Actors, Little Else - One Star","The cast hits the ground running, and the movie is effectively one long chase scene. Naturally, the ensemble cast dies off one-by-one. The actors look good, they all act convincingly, and the some of the scenes do ""work"". However, the movie is too flimsy and empty of meaning to rate any more than one star. This movie needs more of a budget, more of a plot, more of a script, more interaction between characters, *everything* more.The sound is also badly distorted for most of the movie. I don't know if post-production money ran out, but the sound really should have been fixed.The movie commentary is bare-bones, with only the director speaking. The commentary has long, silent spaces which make the commentary a bit boring. The director's cell phone rings three times during the commentary.This is a one-star Asylum film."
1,5th Grade Science Project - Out of Date,"This DVD was awful! It was so poor I would not give it a 1/2 star. It was like watching a film created by 5th graders for their science project. Out of Date, stories told were unexciting and unbelievable. The narrators had dry personalities which made the entire movie drawn out and boring. Not worth a buck. I would recommend watching ""Out of the Blue."""
2,Not what I expected,"If you are looking for a collection of ceremonial moments, this book is not for you! I was looking for ceremonial type rituals that I could do in order to encourage and empower myself. What I did find was an adequate explanation about brain waves and how to get to the ""Alpha"" state. Once in the Alpha state, the author has the person repeat affirming things to herself, such as ""I AM God's beautiful love energy,"" or ""I AM an optimistic and positive thinker."" I was hoping to go a little deeper here. Meditation is great, and I use it all the time. But this book didn't live up to its title."
4,Very good teaching material,This book was physically as described in very good used condition. I happen to own most of the children's literature used by the author. Very good teaching material for early career teachers & teachers looking for interesting material for older struggling readers. A very useful book!
3,Mostly for Committed Fans,"This is Can's scraps. Their scraps are not better than other people's best efforts. Most of the music here is dispensible.Even at a reduced price (the original 2-LP set sold cheaply, and here it's on a single CD) it's no great shakes. I listen to it and shake my head. The full-length ""Doko E"" (never legitimately released) goes on well over the length of an LP side and gathers momemntum brilliantly. Here, it's reduced to an abstract snippet. Why?Can fans will want the tracks cut with Malcolm Mooney that are on here, though. ""Connection"" and ""Fall of Another Year"" are brilliant, and ""The Empress and the Ukraine King"" is pretty good."
4,Can - 'Unlimited Edition' (Mute),"A good Can compilation that was originally put out in 1976,with pretty much most,if not all previously released material.Total of nineteen cuts and a duration of 73:33.Was first available as a low-priced double-lp,now it's all been remastered onto one CD.For fans that are fairly to very familiar with Can's repertoire.Some of the tunes I was decently impressed with were ""Gommorha"",the tribal ""Blue Bag"",""Ethnological Forgery Series,No.27"",""TV Spot"" and the jammin' ""The Empress And The Ukraine King"".Good collection of a highly influential German progressive/kraut band.Long live Can!"
3,Not For Everyone,"Most of this is leftovers that did'nt make it onto the regular releases. There are some gems but mostly it will only appeal to the most devout fan. Better off picking up ""Monster Movie"", ""Delay--1968"" etc."
4,Great Book by Great Author,"McAllister is one of my favorites, and this is one of her best.The author has a knack for likeable characters, and the story had her usual humor and sweetness. But this book also had a degree of poignancy that was a little different for her. Our hero has two big secrets. The first has influenced most aspects of his life, most of his life, and we are let on to it fairly early. The second is only revealed at the end, but I thought it fairly obvious from the start. The heroine is fun, happy and confident. I like her secondary relationships, both with her law partner and a couple of girlfriends. There is a very cute love scene in the epilogue.Read it, you'll love it."
2,"Does not replace the CBK *at all*, but may be worth review","I'm not sure if it was ""just my luck"", but absolutely none of the questions (and VERY few of the concepts) presented in this book were actually on my exam. Perhaps it's due to the continuous evolution of the test question base, but the questions on the exam were VERY specific. So STUDY THE MAIN ISC2 BOOK FIRST AND FREQUENTLY, and only use this ""Dummies"" book for additional light study."
1,Do not buy!!!,"This book is an overview. It does not cover the details that are required for CISSP. I found more helpful resources (PDF, PPT, doc)) on the internet free of cost.Save some money and buy Shon Harris's or Wiley's Exam Prep Guide instead. That is what I did."
1,Wouldn't buy if I could do it again,"This is one of those things where your inner voice tells you not to do but you throw caution to the wind. One should know the ""..for dummies.."" franchise works fine for such things as cooking and wine tasting. When it comes to the CISSP or any other deep and really complicated subject matter they should have left well enough alone. This book is a noble attempt at the usual tongue in cheek approach ""Dummies"" is famous for. I have taken the exam and will have to take it again. I don't blame the book, I blame my choosing to rely on it as one of my resources. Don't buy it."
2,Just passed the CISSP,This book was actually not detailed enough to cover the exam. Your money would be best put to on the new offiical ISC2 CISSP Exam guide.
3,Don't Rely on this Alone for the CISSP Exam,"The text portion of this book is missing too much information to be used as the sole book to prepare for the CISSP exam. I was disappointed with this fact and relied on Shon Harris' book to prepare.When I got close to my exam date, I discovered the real value in the Dummies book. The disk included with it includes hundreds of exam preparation questions. I got lots of them wrong and this caused me to devote more time to studying -- that's just what I needed. I was already using the questions in Harris' book and the free questions on CCCure, but the questions on the Dummies disk came from a different perspective and I benefited from that difference.Without the disk, I would have rated CISSP for Dummies two stars, but the questions on the disk caused me to rate it higher."
2,"Waste of time, Kindle version incomplete",The idea of the Dummies series is to quickly get you going on a subject. in this case its merely a waste of time as you have to read their attempts at cuteness along with actual content. Also the Kindle version is formatted oddly and does not take up the full page plus it seems to be missing some diagrams. Its only a few dollars cheaper than the paper book and unfortunate trend these days with ebooks. Might as well buy the paper book so you have it and keep it or pass it on rather than give the publishers a huge profit in the Kindle version that costs them dramatically less to produce.
3,CISSP for Dummies - Preparing for the Exam,"This book is a good resource for keeping yourself focused when preparing for the exam. The chapters are not ""in depth reviews"" of the 10 Domains, but they do a good job of keep your mind in the study mode. I did like the accompanying CD which contains a series of questions and answers that can be read on a PDA. These were also helpful to stay focused. I would not recommend this book as the sole source for anyone preparing for the exam. For that you should consider the Official (ISC2) Guide or the Shon Harris All-In-One book."
2,lasted only 7 months,"I put one coat, as recommended, for new redwood. It worked well for one rainy season but by the end of Spring, my redwood was gray and during a few April showers, I noticed it was not water proof anymore. It lasted only half a year. I am greatly disappointed by this product. It guarantees 3 years of protection from sun and rain...it didn't even come close. I would not recommend purchasing this product."
1,format listed is error,I understand that this exists only in Pal format. It cannot be viewed in the US.
2,Fell Apart,This knob fell apart within 2 weeks. I would recommend purchasing a metal knob instead of a cheaply stiched together knob.
2,B&M Short Shifter Knob needs an extension,"The B&M Short Shifter Knob fits a B&M shifter but needs an extension if you want the knob above the console. Had to re-use the original shifter knob (equipped with about a 4 inch extension) on my new replacement B&M short shifter (01 Viper), otherwise the with this knob you would be scraping the console with your wrists trying to shift. It is also much smaller than it looks and would look puny in place. Would not recommend this knob."
2,unpleasantly asexual,"...I don't really like this album... I can dig stuff like Ministry because it seems more focused and traditional perhaps. The songs on this album are so uneven and the pacing is so untraditional. Don't get me wrong; I love progressive rock. I listen to Can and Neu and Faust. I just think that this album has progressed in the wrong direction.For a Industrial fan, read another review. For anyone else, take my advice and skip this album. ..."
2,Not as good as the promise,"I still find it hard to listen to this. Amy Hanaiali'i Gilliom sounds rushed and tired, while the musical arrangements are close to embarrassing. I don't know if this was the Willie K. experience, but it's hard to listen to this CD without saying ""auwe, dees one is pretty terrible."" Had it been arranged differently I would have been satisfied. This could have easily put her in the ""where-is-she-now?"" file but she has since redeemed herself with her follow-up."
4,Aptly titled,"I purchased this book for my 10-year old daughter. She was able to figure out most of these puzzles. She is good with spatial puzzles and was able to figure out which sticks to move to create the new picture. I, on the other hand, am not as good as she is so I could figure out the easy ones, but had a much harder time with the others. If you are looking for a book which will develop your ability to figure out how to create a new picture using sticks from an exisitng picture with sticks, this is the book for you. A typical puzzle is how to create two boxes by moving one stick or how to get the dog to face the other direction by moving one stick. My daugher would like to get the second book in this series to continue developing her spatial and problem solving abilities."
4,"Short, but gets your abs burning, all about balance and form!","This DVD is pretty good. The music and encouraging main guy is awesome. I actually have a lot of time to do this video, so I think it's a little short. But it's a great workout for the abs, and even I can feel it afterward, even though I did the modified version of everything! This is great for people that are VERY busy with sports and such, and I would reccamend this to any busy, active teen who needs some DVD like this. Remember: have good balance and form with these moves to get the whole benefit!"
5,Cheers for Superintendent Tennison!! Hate to see the end.,"Three Cheers for the return of Detective Superintendent Jane Tennison. In this DVD, the series comes to an end with a bang. This is the episode that ends it all. Tennsion retires in three months when this episode begins and ends.After viewing all the previous episodes of this series, it feels as if I'm saying goodbye to an old friend.This episode does a good job of illustrating Tennisons' weaknesses and strengths,and faces her demons, both outward and inward. As she searches relentlessly for a missing teen girl, she befriends the girl's best friend, another teen girl that greatly reminds her of herself. Sadly, the friendship is not tobe. Surprises and eye-opening shocks await this episode in almost every scene.Enjoy watching British Mysteries? This is a show worthy to add to your shelf.Enjoy other Prime Suspect episodes, I highly recommend brining this one home, too."
1,not my style,"I loved the Midsomer Murders series (also British), so I thought I might like this. However, the setting is in the inner city slum areas and the star actress is an alcoholic, so the film was extremely depressing. Unless this wouldn't bother you, give it a pass."
5,Good Mood Music,"I listen to the selection entitled, ""Joia"" repeatly while driving my car. It's the most beautiful music I have ever hear. I think ""Joia"" offers a pleasant, soothing and warm beat. All of the artists are playing with lots of creative energy. Its a good mood (Good Feeling) music!"
1,Worse than elevator music,"Anytime you hear that an artist is 'trying something new' when what they were doing in the first place was wonderful, run away! This was recommended to me and so I ordered it. Pretty expensive as far as CD's go too and it was a big disappointment. This actually sounds like bad elevator music. It only puts me in the mood to get out of the elevator... quickly. It's too bad C.D.'s can't be recycled because it's trash. This one will go in the junk pile...even the library didn't want it! Don't waste your time or money. His earlier stuff is much better. Roberto needs to remember the old saying ""Don't fix what ain't broke""."
4,Nothing Beats 40K,"With all the Black Library books of this type (mixed short stories), you get some stories you love and some you don't but Deathwing has been one of the best I've read to date. I enjoyed pretty much every story and even those I didn't care for were well written and admirable. As a fan of the Dark Angels, of which the Deathwing is part of, I somewhat wish the entire novel focused on the Dark Angel Chapter instead of including only a few stories on the subject. Although Deathwing is a group reprint of older 40K fiction, a new edition with some of the modern DA stories alongside original DA stories would have been a pleasant surprise. Even though I was disappointed with that aspect, I cannot hold it against the book. The reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that some of the stories were lacking and seemed almost distant from the 40k universe most fans are used to. All and all an excellent read of die-hard fans and newcomers alike."
3,A little disappointing,"If you are interrested in Warhammer 40,000 and all its writtings this a must have book. But, there are several books that reprint short stories;mostly from the magazine ""Inferno"". This is'nt one of the best. The Title story, ""Deathwing"" is a good read. But, several stories were not as action packed or fast paced as other short stories about the warhammer 40,000 universe."
3,Power to the Power...,"This surge protector is just that, I can't say I have ever been unfortunate to test it during a lighting storm or anything but it works well with placing all other electrical units on the same protector. Considering the warranty the company makes you just have to trust them that it will do it's job when the time comes."
1,A Reference Guide... I Think Not.,"I bought this book hoping a detailed reference guide into the criminal world, but all I recieved with this publication is a book full of lists and very little information. Sadly disappointing."
3,Another Decent Demento Collection,"The age of the internet and a la carte music sales has made compilation albums a bit of a tough sell nowadays. However this Dr. Demento collection does do a good job of putting together a pretty good collection of obscure and hard to find comedy bits, songs and parodies. Some of the songs are newer and can be found elsewhere, but a good many of the songs are classic bits long lost before the digital revolution. As with anything presented by Dr. Demento the comedy is pretty tame, but good for a few chuckles here and there. I look at this set as being the other half of his 20th anniversary set that he didn't have room for. A worthy purchase for a novelty song collector, or someone looking for mild humor, but not much more then that."
3,Fun but a Little Disappointing,"I liked this 2 CD set, but I think I overpaid. There are many cute older type tunes on the discs as well as some newer ones. I would say I liked about one in four songs. Do not buy this item just for one song!"
3,It is good memory album,"I recently previewed this CD.It is good for anyone needing to laugh at life...Otherwise,the songs are in memory jogger until you remember the lyrics."
4,Great book,"Nice book to have for inspiration. Lots of great images and graphics inside. The only thing was that it took about two months to get delivered to me. Other than that, its a good book."
1,product no good,this product is defective play station dose not aprove of its sale the play station company said it should not be sold any where this company selling it has to be aware but continues torep people off!!!!
3,Get it?,"Neither as important nor as outrageous as it pretended to be (or thought it was), TG made occasionally compelling listening. A quasi-ontological guerilla attack, the entire package (music/shock performance/prolix liner notes/suitably anonymous packaging, blah blah) ultimately succeeds only to the extent that the listener ignores its reflexive importance and gets on with just listening to it. If it were as important as it pretends to be, it would be something else--art, maybe. As it is it's a glorious mess and if for any reason you take this stuff seriously, then naturally the joke is on you. If art is a hammer, this is the nail."
5,Another excellent choice...,"This is one of Throbbing Gristle's most consistent recordings; it flows successfully from beginning to end. Track 8 slightly disrupts everything, but the band's hostility towards the crowd provides a bit of comic relief. With Throbbing Gristle, that can be necessary.""Slug Bait"" is one of their best creations. Want to get inside the head of an anti-social personality? ""Slug Bait"" takes you there. It's chilling.Is recording quality an issue? Possibly, but what you get is what you get. There's an overall sound that just tweeks your exposed soul.""After Cease to Exist"" is proof positive that you can be dragged into your subconscious by Gristle without thoughts of murder and suicide. I won't call it a happy place, but you can enter without extreme fear...""United."" You figure it out. That song is twisted..."
1,Very Poor Print Quality,"DO NOT Purchase this download. The quality is so poor, you can barely make out the notes. The music sheet is a copy of a copy 100X's over then it was scanned. I immediately contacted Amazon for a refund and told them that they should be ashamed of themselves for putting something of this poor qualtiy for sale."
4,Love this!,"I love this music and love to play it. The only problem that I have with this particular purchase is that the measure numbers are off. It can be rather annoying, but that's the only reason that I gave this four stars instead of five!"
3,"It won't inspire you, but you gotta do it","Not too bad for government work, but it's just a statement of the facts... Well, mostly. This book contains some really confusing errors, and glazes over some fundamental concepts (what are all those vectors on the autorotation diagram???). But, the FAA is always right, and this book does hit almost everything you need to know, so you need to read it. Also, as a CFI, you'll want to know the ""Common Errors"" that follow each maneuver (altho many of them are pretty obvious). To really learn how to fly a helicopter from an armchair, I'd consider Wagtendonk's Principles of Helicopter Flight my primary source, and come back to the RFM only as a supplement."
5,Awesome book a MUST have,Just like all the other ASA/FAA books - this one is a must for your aviation library.
4,A realistic and different view of World War II,"I personally recommend this book. It's a touching story and shows a very different aspect from a survivor. As all of us may know how bloody the World War II can be, the way Aranka Siegal writes reserves the cruelness of the war itself. Her story rather focuses on the people in the difficult time, and it makes an unforgetable sadness and impression in the readers' minds. All readers would sympathize for what the main character, Piri (also the author), has been through. It is, for sure, a very successful book."
3,not interesting enough for my taste,"I like history and the subject of World War II and Nazi Germany, that is why I was surprised how much I did not like this book. I found it boring and uninteresting. I wish the book had more action. I guess it was hard for me to identify with a nine year old girl and what she went through. I also do not like endings that leave you hanging. I wish we knew what happened to them after they got on the train. It was almost like I wish the book started where it ended. This book is probably better for someone younger or for someone who wants to avoid the violence and terror of World War II."
3,Upon the Head of the Goat,"A powerful story about a family in the grip of Nazi Gremany. So moving, I was glad it was a novel. The pain of seeing family members brutalized by the German soldiers is something I wish our young people could understand the privelges they have. Recommed this work"
5,Cute,"The book was very cute. I bought it for my nephew for his birthday. The story was really cute, it was a very colorful. I would recommend this book."
5,Limu the Blue Turtle,It was a very cute story. It reminded me of the Ugly Duckling theme. My grandson enjoyed hearing it. He is a toddler.
4,Cute Book ---- But it Needs a Child-Friendly Font,"This is a cute story, however, the publisher chose a font that is not good for beginning readers. It's extremely important for publishers of children's books to use a font that is consistent with the way children are learning to read and write their letters. It really helps a child move from recognizing letters to sounding out words. I hope the publisher will consider a more child-friendly font for future editions of this book."
4,An interesting read,"Barsness is one of the best shooting writers out there, in my opinion. As originally published, this book was outrageously expensive, and if the discounts now offered on it are any measure, it didn't sell well. At under $10, this book is now an outrageously good value, even if you're not a Barsness fan.He covers all aspects of wingshooting and guns, and doesn't confine himself to the typically (North) American approach. Refreshing and interesting."
5,for beginner rockers,"one of the best books to learn drumset from! starts from basic sticking exercies and gets more complex as you progress; exercises incorporate snare, bass drum, open and closed hi-hat, and ride cymbal if you wish.if pursued properly, the method offers an increase in speed and endurance of a drummer's hands and feet, knowledge of rock-oriented rhythms, basic independence of the hands and feet, and the mastering of soul and jazz-rock beats of famous 20th century drummers."
5,Beautifully made film,This is a great film. It has a very compelling story and was beautifully shot. The ebb and flow between the characters is gripping and you will greatly enjoy watching.
5,heathens and thieves,"A great western. Lead actor, Simpson, does a great job ..dark...pensive..stays in character. Fun to watch a western like this."
5,If you love westerns.,"If you like westerns you'll love this one. Unique plot, great acting, keeps you guessing the whole time. I don't find enough of this quality. B"
1,won't play,I ordered this movie twice the second time it still wouldn't play the rep said it won't play for anyone thats really too bad it sounds like it would be a good movie. Anyway Amazon credited my acct. immediately which was great I ordered something else.
4,One of the best Westerns of this century (so far),"This is a wonderful classic Western in the tradition of Sergio Leone and Lonesome Dove, happily updated for modern times without the awful racial stereotypes so common of this genre in the 40's through the 80's. While the bit-part Hispanic characters don't get to be much more than cardboard cutouts, overall this is a great film in the classic tradition that finally manages to portray the complexities of race and the post-Reconstruction New West without the usual Cowboys and Indians tropes. A post-millennial, post-racial Western that still evokes all of the wonderful noir and grit of its lineage without the redface, blackface, and yellowface that detracts from the originals. Up there with the Coen's True Grit reboot, Blackthorn, Deadwood, and Hell On Wheels. About damn time."
1,Oh this is 5 Star all the way - you bet!,"You might want to check out this little gem of a clip before you rent this stinker - every ""user"" who gave this 5 stars should have their account deactivated - nothing but a bunch of phony accounts for the purposes of padding reviews - I wonder what you get paid for a phony review[...]"
3,"Good, not great","This volume is a mixed bag of hit & misses. Stand-out cuts include the appropriately titled ""Sweet Thing"" (Chaka Khan & Rufus), ""I'll Be Good To You"" (Brothers Johnson), and ""Best Of My Love"" (The Emotions). Otherwise, this set focuses a little too much on ""quiet storm"" tracks of the disco era, including the ultra-wimpy ""Tryin' To Love Two"", with Stax soul legend William Bell singing over what has to be the weakest rhythm section of his career. Still, some great hard-to-find tunes are here if you don't mind hitting the ""skip"" button once in awhile. And long-time fans of the series should enjoy it."
4,An excellent Cold War espionage novel.,"I couldn't disagree more with the review here that states that this is a terrible book. Len Deighton is quite rightly considered one of the masters of the espionage novel. This is the first of his first series of books, which also included 'Funeral in Berlin', 'Billion Dollar Brain', 'Horse Under Water', and 'An Expensive Place to Die'. Deighton's mastery of dialogue is apparent, along with his ability to make the reader feel a part of the story and era. Deighton's research into contemporary Cold War espionage practices and bureaucracy is superb, as in all his books. Very believable, crisp, and gripping. Highly recommended (if you can find a copy!"
3,The Ipcress File,"The Ipcress File is an uneven, although occasionally fascinating adventure concerning nuclear weapons and thought reform. The book's strong points-- its humorous style and interesting subject matter-- are sometimes lost in a meandering plot. The story's conclusion is anti-climactic and reminiscent of American adaptations of foreign films, in which everything is explained to the viewer down to the last little detail. Unfortunately, what's unnecessary in American movies is all too necessary in Deighton's book. His decision to leave numerous threads untied until late in the book make it a somewhat confusing read. The discussion of thought reform near the end is interesting and for me, indicates a direction the book could have taken which would have made it more interesting and less like a film treatment."
2,Madrigal Overload,"I wanted to like this cd more than I did, as I like Miranda Sex Garden and enjoy period music. However, because of the form (the madrigal) and the singing/production, I find I seldom listen to it.If you are REALLY CERTAIN that you want a full cd of madrigals, this could be your best ticket. However, I hadn't listened to 25 madrigals in a row before, and I found it to be a form that got on my nerves more quickly than expected. Additionally, while the women of Miranda Sex Garden are an intriguing and underrated goth band, their voices can't really sustain an entire cd of a capella singing. Or - perhaps the madrigal form doesn't give the singers the opportuinity to shine. Either way, I find the result ultimately unsatisfying.I admire the band and the concept, and find it quite enjoyable in short spurts. I can't recommend the cd, though."
3,"Nice Concept, Poor Execution","The performances and material here might actually be quite good, but poor production, recording, and mixing choices make it difficult to tell. Every track on the disc sounds essentially the same, without even comprehensible lyrics to distinguish them. I recommend starting with their later work."
4,cool!,"i got this after getting jocelyn n david's ""lux vivens"" and heard she had other music.i dig this;don't listen to it regularly,but i like it!really lush female vocals which are professionally executed.wish some songs were longer."
3,"Great Soundtrack, inferior sound.","I was a little disappointed when I got this. No denying it's one of the best thriller soundtracks ever, but there's a lot of variation in the quality of the remastered sound. The composer-led performance is wonderfully ferocious. Too bad the original tapes deteriorated so much that the listener is distanced from that ferocity. Get it, but be prepared for imperfection."
5,Soundtrack from Alfred Hitchcock's movie: North by Northwest,"An outstanding reproduction of the soundtrack for North by Northwest. Bernard Hermann did a masterful job of writing the music for this movie. Great movies like this one are made great by a variety of factors. The musical score for this movie plays a large part in contributing to its greatness. After having seen the movie, I can reminisce by just listening to the soundtrack. The reproduction is great and, from what I have read, we are lucky to have access to it since the original was missing for some time and only recently recovered. If you loved the movie, you will love this soundtrack."
4,Let's Get Real,"Eileen Yin-Fei Lo is an excellent teacher and I have several of her books, and love them all, but to be real honest, this is not a low-fat low-cal cookbook. This is a tiny portion cookbook.At first glance her recipes seem to be low-cal, low-fat, but look again. For instance, tonight I made the pepper steak recipe. Delicious yes, but the recipe called for 4 oz. of meat and 3/4 lb. of peppers and this was supposed to feed 6 people! Maybe that would be satisfactory if you were making several dishes and soup, but for a Sunday night one pot dinner it was just enough for two, tripling the calorie and fat content listed.Yes buy the book and cook from it, just take a real look at portions and how many a dish is supposed to feed and then ask yourself is this really going to feed my family?"
3,"Cute, But...","Cute little charm but I was a bit disappointed that mine does not have the colored detail portrayed in the photo. Mine is all sterling silver. I like it enough to keep it, but the photo is misleading.I have purchased multiple charms from this seller and have generally been satisfied with them."
5,great cd!,this is an awesome band! just wished that i had caught on to them before they went their separate paths.
5,Feel the beat,"This album is one of the greats that have been overlooked by the masses. I first started going to see the band in a small club in Denton, Tx back in 96. The first time I saw them live it blew me away. They came out in gas mask with hoses and stuff strung up everywhere. They are true show men. But that says nothing for their music. The music is driving, fast, and hardcore to the bone. They deliever smart lyrics, driving guitar and their bass player is out of site. Some people might have heard of the basses Mike Dane. He has worked as a studio bass player for many great artist such as Andy Timmons, whom he still plays gigs with. If you like kill music this is a great one. Its sick its twisted and its done with flare. Buy this album you won't be disappointed."
2,I've read better dog stories.,Would I buy this book if I knew what I was going to be reading? Probably not. I've read many other dog stories and this is on the bottom of my list. I had a very hard time reading it because it just wasn't interesting. I would not recommend this book.
4,A title?,Item was as described. Purchase was easy. Shipping was good. Wife thought the total price was high though. Probably should have bought more items at a time to reduce impact of shipping fee.
5,Every church and synagogue in America should own this,"Five stars aren't high enough for some movies. This is a masterpiece to savor, watch again and again, share with children, and pass along to generations yet to come. Why can't more movies inspire as much hope and goodness as this one? Buy a copy for yourself; buy another to give to your church or synagogue."
4,Fair and Moving Documentary,"Sauvage does a great job of portaying the folk of Le Chambon in their magnificent modesty. He allows the characters to speak at length and refrains from melodrama for the most part. He demonstates the awesome potential of good-doing in the midst of extreme cruelty, even if he plays down the Christ-centered source of the Protestant's compassion."
2,"Very nice API for 20 pages - rest is, how you put it? - crap",Starts off well explaining API programming then goes into MFC and does a Titanic!Get some of Schildt's programming books instead
2,beginners??,"having typed in the code of the very first programm, i had to discover that the programm doesn't work! Zeros (0) are printed as O's (O)... and that makes a huge diffrence; i picked that up, but there seems to be other things wrong, as my compiler ain't compiling.... beginners stuff - NOT!"
1,"Hello, world?","I type in the prog1_1 and it would not link, using Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0. From then on the rest of the book got very confusing. I got discourage and gave up on it! But at least I got ""Hello World"" to linked, compiled, and executed in DOS and Linux, using something called gcc. I can see why dos and unix programming in C can be easier than Windows programming. Oh well!"
2,O.K.,I haven't even seen this c.d. except for now. I looked at all of the songs and I haven't heard of any. Fo 43 bucks i don't think it is worth it.
3,Very Good read and essential for World Religions Studies,"I found this book to be an excellent read and the reason for my lower rating is based on the author got bogged down in too many layers of details at times. For some, this is not a problem but I felt that after the author made the point very well he continued to add dimensions that could have confused the original statement. The best part of the book is near the end when the author begins to tackle the practicle questions and applications. But it is an essential read for Major World Religions!!!"
3,Well built but problematic for rifles with pistol grips,"Nicely built. Thick, smooth leather pad. Good sized strong hardware. Not good for AR style rifles or anything with a pistol grip stock - the grip hits the bottom support bar and rifle wont sit level."
3,An imaginative trip to the world below.,"Through a series of short stories, Rey Rosa introduces us not only to a scary world beyond, but also to a new line in Guatemalan literature. Also, interesting mixing of scenaries. Even though, it was Rey Rosa's first work is strong and provocative. It makes you want to keep track of this young writer."
3,Worst of the series--too bad,"For a good travelogue of Greece in the Roman era, this would be fine, as a novel--it's tedious. There's little mystery, hardly any menace, the wit is too caustic and nasty to be funny, and the characters seem lifeless.I was bored throughout. Better luck next time."
4,Falco on the road again,"While I don't think that the plot of this Marcus Didius Falco potboiler was the best of the series to date, the vast array of information presented the reader about First Century AD Rome and Greece is simply terrific. For example, here is a rarely presented account of tourism in the classic age as well as much intriguing information about the Olympic Games, albeit in the Roman period. The author, Lindsey Davis, is well acquainted with the subject of early travel, having sent Falco on the road many times before, but this book's setting in Greece is quite enjoyable on its own. Also always enjoyable is the interplay between the members of Falco's family. What's not to like?"
4,"great read, but...","Great read as usual from Ms Davis, but the editing leaves much to be desired. You can't keep substituting ""die"" for ""the"" over and over without it getting distracting!A human editor would be greatly appreciated, especially when we're paying top price for the book."
4,See Delphi and Die,Davis had Falco and company head to Greece to solve a murder. A well woven story with a lot of of wit.
2,Kreg screws not as reviewed,bought the large quatity based on a review that stated the screws were the square drive only type.They were the optional phillips head and square combination which do not work as well and can strip easier.disappointed but I'll use them up and look elsewhere next time.
4,Enjoyable,This is well-written book that is enjoyable to read and interesting all the way through even though it bogs now here and there.
5,Well done History,"I just finished reading ""The Few"" and really enjoyed it. Mr. Kershaw does an excellent job with this book. I really felt transported back to the Battle of Britain and appreciated getting to know those pilots. I highly recommend this book."
4,"Review of ""The Few""","Kershaw's books are very readable. Like ""The Bedford Boys"", this book starts with some backstory of the principle characters. It's enough so the reader gets familiar with the people; not so much that the writing bogs down with too much detail. As for the war narrative, Kershaw neither dwells on aeronautical detail nor completely omits it. A few choice pieces of information help to give the reader some insight into flying and fighting in WWII cockpits (for more detailed writing about WWII aerial combat, see the works of the author Martin Caidin, who wrote multiple books in the 60's and early 70's on the subject). I enjoyed the ""comparative"" pieces, in which he tries to synchronize the British side of a particular mission or day of fighting with the German perspective of that same day. I am an avid reader of WWII history, and I enjoyed this book. Kudos to Kershaw for shedding light on the lives of some men that we generally know very little about."
4,An excellent book and well worth the read!,"During the Viet Nam war when Canadians were welcoming American draft dodgers and deserters, I wrote that there was another time when young American men broke American law and were welcomed by the Canadians. Only then it was Americans going to Canada to join the RCAF or a few who continued to England to join the RAF and fight the Battle of Britain. This is the story of that few . . . and what a story it is. Alex Kershaw brings it to life with an up close and personal view of their lives as well as the lives of the other young pilots in Spitfires and Hurricanes plus the German view of the battle from Me-109s and 110s.Excellent and detailed descriptions of dogfights seem like fiction until you check the footnotes and find that they are taken from many actual individual combat reports. An excellent book and well worth the read! Alex Kershaw also wrote The Bedford Boys."
4,War: What Is It Good for?,"This volume should not be missed by anyone who can read, listen, or feel Braille. It will remind the reader what war really is: SOMETIMES necessary, ALWAYS a tragedy. If you like tales of adventure and self-sacrificing valor, then this book is for you. If you want the world to remember that every fallen soldier is a universe of wasted potential, then this book is for you too. Also, there are cool airplanes. Caveat to the Francophile: The author is careless with the spelling of French words."
4,WWII Buffs Will Enjoy,"Anyone with an interest in history and human motivation will enjoy this story woven from memories, letters and official records of American flyers who joined the RAF mostly for the chance to fly but who found more."
2,Sloppy Hack Work,"How is this book getting such high marks? Family and friends of the author? It's sloppily researched, unevenly edited and reads more like propaganda than history.And if that's not bad enough, much of Kershaw's writing is cringe inducing:Panzer tanks? Why not automobile cars?And why the constant quotation marks to call out terms everyone knows the meaning of: ""piece of cake,"" ""jolly good sport,"" ""grim reaper"" ...And do we really need to know the telephone at the airfield was made out of Bakelite every time it rings? That the Spitfire's engines were made by Rolls-Royce? The Messerschmidt's by Daimler-Benz? That the Spitfire's canopy screen was made out of a type of plastic called Perspex? It's all so much word padding and it gets annoying fast.When it comes to the Germans Kershaw is so out of his depth he should of just stuck with the RAF pilots.Hans Guderian? Really. An author writing about World War II doesn't catch something that obvious?"
2,Great when it works,"The good stuff first: This remote works with most all brands out there, and the one thing I had that it didn't work with (a Sony VCR), I was able to let it find the right code itself, and it worked great. The button layout is very simple and easy to understand; however, the power button would be better placed near the device switching buttons. It also allows you to make some functions global. For example, I have mine set up to allow the volume on the tv to change for every button except the stero button.Now the bad news. I am on my second remote because after about 6-8 months the most used buttons tend to wear out and are not usable. On my first remote it was that arrow buttons. On the second remote, it is the volume and power buttons that have worn out."
1,Not compatible with my Sony TV,"When attempting to program, none of the Sony codes worked with my 20"" Wega. I even cycled through hundreds of codes for like 40 minutes to no avail. When I returned it to amazon.com I got penalized $5 for shipping. So an $8 remote - $5 return shipping = one sorry sucker, me."
4,Instant Teen volume 1!,Instant Teen is a great series! This review is ONLY FOR VOLUME 1! Alright so this volume is good but not AMAZING.... the storyline is minorly jumpy but thats ok! The story is about a young girl who wishes she could grow up. She encounters some fun adventures and this volume ends with a cliffhanger (sorta)! Well if you like good art and a good story GET THIS BOOK! (It gets better trust me!)
4,Foot Extraction,"The character of George Findlay really should have been played by a horse.With him, the suspense is not, as it was once said of a character on another newsroom type show altogether, how he was going to get his other foot into his mouth, but rather how in the world he was going to extract any of his feet, frequnently more rhan two of them at the same time, from it.Or maybe an octupus, except they don't actually have feet.Would actually have preferred to give this one 4.75 stars.Am just not that much into cartoon allegories, even as well done as the final episode ""Learning to Fly"""
2,DuWop Revolotion,it gets streaky. i didnt really like this product. i suggest buying the cosmedicine tinted moisturizer.
2,Not a good trike,"We used to have one of the nicer Kettler trike with the push bar and rubber tires and loved it. Unfortunately we loaned it to friends that moved out of state with it, so when our youngest needed a trike we went shopping. I couldn't justify another expensize trike this last time, so we bought this one. What a mistake. The cheap plastic wheels don't turn easily at all. One barely turns period. The push bar is too short to be ergonomic either. I'm 5'7"" and have to stoop to push it. I wish we had gone ahead and spent the extra money on a good quality trike."
2,not so good,"I bought the proper Kettler's for my grandsons and they LOVE them. I thought at my house I could get this cheaper one. Not worth the money; buy the better one. This one doesn't have locking steering, or the the peddles that work or not depending on the skill level. I am going to try to return it.Please don't make the same mistake."
4,Eye-opening!,"I got this book as a gift from my best friend - who's been a ""health nut"" for years. I'm just the opposite! This book really was an eye-opener for me though in many ways. It's shocking what gets put on and into our food. I'd never really thought about it much before. Anyway, I've made some of the recipes and they came out great, I especially recommend the seitan fajitas and the lasagna - really easy to prepare. I learned more from this book than I thought I would. I only wish it had color photographs."
4,"Awesome, except one little mark that bugs me.","It's a beautiful little bowl and an adorable little spreader, especially for the price, but mine came with a random green mark on the inside of the rim. It's not part of the pattern, maybe a stray flick of paint or something. It's not anything that ruins the piece, but it kind of disappointed me. I didn't have time to return it and get a new one before Christmas day, so I decided to keep it anyway.I'm still rating it four stars because it's microwave safe, large enough for any kind of dip, and the spreader is delicate and cute. I got compliments from the family and plan to buy the rest of the pieces in this line."
4,"Elegant, pretty, lovely dish - spreader scuffed","This dip set was purchased to go with the Winterberry dinnerware set. The dinnerware is not fine china, rather it is very nice stoneware that is sturdy yet appears very elegant because of the delicate decor. All pieces came intact and there were no flaws in any of them, with the exception of a scuff on the blade of the spreader. Every piece purchased was on sale, making it easier to buy extra pieces."
2,Ponderous Napoleon,"This is a book for someone who wants to know all the persons and events surrounding the rise of Napoleon. However, I found it very dry reading. It conveyed none of the suspense, excitement, or feeling that I had expected."
1,cheated,"I live in Panama, Central America. So when I got this defective charger I was more than upset because I knew how hard it would be for me to turn it back. I'm very dissapointed."
1,No stencils...,"A great example as to why you should always read other's reviews. I failed to do so this time, and it seems I am in the same boat with a lot of others, disappointed. These are such intricate designs that they are difficult to trace, even with a light box. This book has proven to be a pointless purchase. I wish I would have invested the money in actual stencils..."
2,NOT Stencils!,"I should have read the reviews BEFORE I bought the book. These are NOT stencils, and they are not transferable to the skin. But they are beautiful. I'm working on a way to trace the art in a way that will apply it to the skin like tattoo artists do before they tattoo someone. They use a product called Spirit Paper. Hopefully it will work!Spirit Master Thermal Transfer Paper Tattoo Stencil 25 Pcs"
2,Disappointing,"Personally I was not impressed with this book. I expected for 250 designs the author would have included a greater variety of indian, turkish, african, egyptian and other mehndi designs.The designs mainly resemble each other although there are a few pretty ones in between. Also for the novice the book does not offer any information on the history of a design pattern, or identifies them and gives no clue to the significance or meaning of any of the designs.The author also does not offer any advice on how to go about attempting some of the patterns included."
4,Great ideas for Mehendi,"I am fairly new to this stuff, I started doing henna tattoos on my feet and hands last summer. This is hard stuff! This book was full of great designs. It is not a book of stencils, please dont buy it if that is what you are looking for. If you are looking for ideas, and designs- this is a top knotch book for you!"
2,"Pretty clip art, but no stencils","I got thrown off by the use of the word stencil in the book title. This isn't a book of stencils, it's a book of clip art. :("
1,Misleading title,"If you are expecting to receive actual stencils, you will be disappointed (as was I!). These are only printed pages (and printed on both sides, what's more). You will have a ton of work if you want to try and transfer these designs to anything, especially since most of them are so intricate and detailed. Let me know if you find the REAL stencils!"
3,250 STENCILS YEAH RIGHT!,i thought i was getting stencils not stuff printed on paper! oh well its fine for that price and i think i can figure out how to use it with my henna stuff.
3,It isn't a stencil book,Actually this book is not a stencil book but it's very inspiring if you're intrested in Indian motifs.I used some of the designs in my authentic graphics.
2,Lund bug shield for 2001 ford escape,"Was totally disappointed. The shield was too narrow and did not really protect the car hood enough. Also, the ad showed something totally different - a different car. There should be a different photo for the specific car.Lund 730095 Interceptor II Smoke Colored Wrap Bug Shield"
4,Super Pump,I'm using this on a 58cm Trek 520 Looks great on the bike and is well built (so it seems) but the aluminum scratches quite easily. That's the only reason I did not give it 5 stars. I researched frame pumps quite a while so save yourself the time and trouble just buy it!
5,fit perfectly,Great fit for my small frame bike. Gets pressures high enough for my road bike. Easy to use.
3,"Yellowish paper, small type, not crisp illustrations","This volume documents the development and diversity of contemporary architecture in Germany form 1970 until 1996. It featurs 50 specially chosen buildings, each on a double page with a project description, photograph(s), plan(s), sometimes section; all - in alphabetical order by architect. There are works by Alvar Aalto, Tadao Ando, Gunter Behnisch, Norman Foster, Frank Gehry, Nicholas Grimshaw, Walter Gropius, Herman Herzberger, Zaha Hadid, Hollein, Libeskind, Siza, Stirling, et al. Unlike the Paperback Studio series, this book's paper and printing leaves a bit to be desired. The B&W only illustrations are not very crisp, the text type (lettering) is very small and a bit difficult to read, and the paper is yellowish. The book is inferior to ""The New German Architecture"" by Feldmeyer."
2,Hit-and-miss recipes,"Some recipes are really good (Salmon Balls, Peanut Butter Bites), but others aren't. Some have so much oil in them that the treats are, well, oily.Some recipes are just a variation on others--substitute turkey for chicken and you have a whole new entry in the book.One recipe--chicken and cheese biscuits--contains NO CHEESE whatsoever.Many recipes contain cornmeal."
2,should have read description more thoroughly,I thought they were glass crystals...they are plastic and float a bit. Not too bad but not what I wanted.
5,This book should carry a warning label!,"I arrived at at the office with tear-stained cheeks and blood-shot eyes two days in a row because of the heart-felt stories on this audio book. As soon as I heard it I knew I had to buy a copy for my mom. If she listens in the car, I just hope she can see the road through her tears!"
5,A book for all,"Contrary to this books title, this is a must read for either sex. These strories would inspire anyone with a soft heart and a need for inspiration. As I became more involved in these wonderful life stories, I felt that no matter what obstacle, I could overcome it. Chicken Soup For The Woman's Soul is easily the best collection of works I have ever read"

1,Would have given it no stars if it were possible....,"As someone who's followed Bruce Gilbert's solo career with interest, I was looking forward to listening to this release, especially as I had enjoyed the similarly packaged ""Ab Ovo"". Well, what can I say, except to register my profound disappointment over this lazy, self-indulgent drivel. The opening ""Soli"", begins as a harsh foreboding electronic wall-of-sound: after 5 minutes you get the general idea - a ""confrontational"" display of what Whitehouse and their useless imitators used to call ""Power Electronics""; after 10 you're bored silly and just wish it would stop; incredibly, this nonsense then continues for another 35 minutes, a truly pointless and arrogant exercise, Gilbert's 'Metal Machine Music', and about as interesting to listen to. The two other tracks are featureless electric drones but at least they're short. Dreadful, quite dreadful."
4,"Not music, to be sure!","The newest release of former Wire guitarist Bruce Gilbert is probably the most brutally dissonant soundscape ever committed to disc. The main title ""Soli"" lasts over 45 mins. and sounds mostly like amok-running drilling machines. No rhythms and melodies, just pure noise. While the previous album ""Ab Ovo"" is recommended to everyone with a sense for innovative electronic music, ""In Esse"" is for very advanced hardcore listeners only."
3,Ufos at Area 51?,"This documentary was made in 1997 about the mystery of Americas most secret base, Area 51 or otherwise known as Dreamland. Area 51 researcher Glen Campbell is interviewed throughout the program and talks about mystery that surrounds this secret base that's not suppose to exist. There is also an interview with the owners of the Little Ale in. There are more up to date programs out there on this topic but still not a bad program. The program runs for 54 minutes.Transfer is video quality with the occasional line streaming down the image. The audio is Dolby stereo 2.0 and is average. For the extras, there is 58 minutes of ufo footage, the quality is very poor quality, and whoever put this extra on forgot to include audio. This feature runs for 58 minutes."
2,Not the best Area 51 Video!,"Out of all of the Area 51 videos I have viewed, this one is probably the worst. It does not touch on any of the key points of the mystery surrounding area 51. It also does not touch on the more ""hands-on"" information that viewers might find usefull when visiting the Groom Lake area. Nothing about the security force, the borders and no GOOD footage or photographs. I highly reccomend Amazon customers try another video in stead of this one. The only reaons I gave it 2 stars is because of the cool box cover and graphics sequences."
1,AREA 51,"This was very boring, and when i got to the additional footage for the extras, there was no audio...I wish I had not ordered this title-this actually rates no-stars"
1,Fixable...,"These obviously didn't go through any kind of quality control at all. After taking each one apart, grinding the cast parts to the correct shape and re-assembling they're OK tools. These are an acceptable option only if you have plenty of time on your hands and don't mind tinkering."
3,Light duty use only.,"Not too well made but, what do you want for cheap? Serves my purpose at work for light duty gear/bearing pulling."
3,Mixed bag of treats.,"This is a collection of 13 short separate stories. They each feature a different team member as the main character and the stories vary in focus. From action to tears, from humor to courage and self examination. Some are well written,(Peace Offering and Once a Thief come to mind) and others are quite forgetable,(The Stuff Dreams Are Made Of was very dissapointing). To this mix add the wonderful introduction written by Stan Lee telling how the idea for the Xmen was concieved and you get a book worth buying."
5,great overview of the X-Men,"Like other Marvel anthologies, this looks at the X-Men all through their history. I'm not sure why there needed to be a Madrox the Multiple Man story, but the storys good, so what the heck. And all the solo stories are _fantastic_ -- especially the Rogue/Carol Danvers duelling diary entries story by Jenn Heddle.This is a must-buy for X-Men fans for sure. The stories are all well written, the illustrations by Mike Zeck are great, and it's nice to get some gaps filled, like Dori Koogler's untold Colossus story with Callisto and Keith R.A. DiCandido's origin of the Changeling.But the best is Glen Haumann's ""Chasing Hairy,"" which is an interview with the Beast. Haumann also wrote the great interview with the Angel in _The Ultimate X-Men_, and this is a cool followup.Buy this book, X-fans!"
5,Buy this book,This is a great book. I especially liked the stories about Rogue and Gambit. Jennifer Heddle's Rogue/Carol Danvers shared diary story was an especially fun read. Great characterization. It's a must own for X-Men fans.
3,One Gem in Tom Dejas work,"A random collection of stories, three are no better than the fan-fic you find on the net - the rest are relatively good - the star is Steel Dogs and Englishmen.Maybe try a library instead of forking out."
3,"Cam is really tight, snapped and bruised my finger","Cam level is really tight, hard to pull open and close...snapped back and bruised my middle aged weakling finger."
1,"does not work well, no service","I have the TP-2 and it never worked wellBlackburn did not return my e-mail asking for help, and, when I called, told me they could not help me and I should buy a new pump if mine did not workDon't buy one and don't count on any support from the company"
3,Not great for Hi pressures,"I wouldn't buy this again, I ride road and have competed for the past 6 months. Have had the pump for 18 months. It is easy to use and has a great warranty, but I find its not that great for getting tubes to high pressures like 120psi, it squeaks and leaks at these pressures (ok till it gets to 100psi in my experience). Is great for the kids bikes and my mountain bike, but if you want a pump for very hi pressure road tyres, I wouldn't recommened this one."
2,Not the best,The pump does work but its main downfall is that it does not seal around the presta valve very well. It is also harder then I expected to pump at high pressure 120 PSI or higher.I would not recommend this pump.
1,"Broken, blackburn wont answer phone/reply to email","Well, the first year or so this pump worked fine (keep in mind I was really only using it to pump kids bikes up to ~40-60psi) ..then i started using it on my bmx bike (to get to like ~80psi) and it just recently started leaking air... so now its worthlessI emailed Blackburn over a week ago with no response, tried to call them twice today with no response... i have a feeling this is going to be a hassle. It says on their website that there is a 'lifetime' warranty on all pumps, but i have yet to receive any service on mine.I would not go near this pump if you are using it on any real bike, that needs more than 40psi.So far I've had horrible 'service' from Blackburn, or rather none at all.Stay away"
5,Great pumping,This is a great pump. Works smoothly and seems very durable. I bought a cheap foot pump a while back and it died within a couple of months. Sometimes expensive is better.
4,so far so good..,I took this pump out of the box and pumped up my hybrid bike tires to about 65psi w/o any issues in minutes. I experienced no leakage and it seemed to seal well around the presta valve. I have yet to try it on tires requiring more than 65psi but will be very disappointed if it could not handle this capacity.
4,1800 Watt Crown Electric Stapler,"Receive the stapler promptly and it work fine. Suggest you offer the staples for sale, as the 20 gauge size is hard to find."
1,"Awesome sound, but crap construction","After 3 years of moderate, careful use, the left earphone died (it emits at ~10% the volume of the right earphone).Given that my 50$ JVC headphones (that is, 329$ cheaper than the Shure SE530) are still alive and well after 8 years of much heavier use, I consider the durability of this item outrageously short. A pity, since its sound quality is truly stellar."
3,Great sound but poor build up,"The sound quality is great. It is also comfortable specially with the new black foam. However, the cable quality is rather poor. After one week of regular wearing, it starts to break. I can see a visible scratch on it. I had a pair of Ultimate Ears Super.fi 5 Pro for one year, regardless of sound quality, I can definitely tell that the overall quality is better than Shure SE530. For a $400 earphone, I suggest Shure spend a little more to build a durable cable."
5,Great sound but Poor Quality Do NOT buy.,"Originally gave 5 stars for great sound but after using these for over a year plus another Shure model for over a year they have a major problem with the quality of the material used to make them. I have had to send both models, including this one, back to Shure within the 2-year warranty because of the insulation around the earbuds begin cracking badly showing the copper wiring. Shure sent me a new set with now problem but after the warranty they will charge $125 to repair them. Not worth it. Shure needs to use more flexible wiring. So new rating, if I could change it would be 1 star."
1,A different goods arrived.,"I have received the goods I bought and different goods.I boght Shure SE530 Sound Isolating Earphones.I have received Shure SE535 (Metallic Bronze).I commissioned to exchange it by mail, but you don't answer with only auto-reply."
3,It's all about the fit.,"After spending 5 minutes getting them to fit just right they sound awesome at high and super high volumes. The base drops off fast at normal and low volumes. My $150 Bose over the ear headphones sound better, my $40 Sony earbuds fit better. You have to loop the wire over your ear, adding to the hassle of putting them on and taking them off. The included selection of earbud tips included just one pair that fit right for me. But wait, the gift box looks great!"
1,Not worth the price.,"These are supposed to be noise isolating and they don't do it at all. They don't fit in my ears, either, despite the different attachments. Overall, the pair I had before that cost half of the price were much better."
5,AWESOME,"I also like many others have trialed many different types of headphones/earphones and had yet too find the ultimate set.Well i believe i have found them despite only having owned these for a short time,but trialed bose ear and headphones and also reading another review by a customer on here who obviously knew what he was on about definately sold them for me!!!!!!They are very comfortable and am wary (from reading same review)about how to pull them out correctly as yeah they seem a little vunerable by being pulled out by the wire rather than the main body.Am very happy with my product for the price which i don't mind paying when i get something that makes music sound this outstanding (and can notice a difference)and may i have many years of quality playing time with these..........once you try shure ,i'm sure you'll never go back!!!happy listening"
1,"If I could rate lower, I would","I bought the SE530 from a local place (not amazon), and used them for a couple of years. I spent a lot of money on them and thought you get what you paid for. I was wrong. About a month after the warranty expired, the cable started to split. I didn't think much of it because it wasn't an issue with others online yet. I contacted shure for an out of warranty cable replacement, and they would have charged me for it.I have had these on my shelf now for a few years because of the split cable occasionally electrocuting me behind my ear. It's a shame that the only thing wrong with these are the cables, and I paid so much for them. This will definitely be my last shure product and would encourage others to look elsewhere."
3,Good earbuds but pricy for its sound quality.,"I have a bose triport earbud, Shure E2-c , and a collection of new headsets from grado and seenheiser so I know quality when I hear it. This shure earbud is made of quality but does not justify its price. I am not a cheapskate, I spend thousands of dollars on amazon monthly buying electronics and this is one of those purchase where I put in my ear and realized my 100 dollar earbuds sounded the same as the this one. I put on all my other collections just to compare the quality. This is ALOT better then the Shure E2-c but not that much better than the bose triport ($100). Bose triport is heavy on the bass and Shure SE530 sounded bland. Shure SE530 low, mid, and highs sounded bland. There are so many other earbuds out there less than $150 dollars that are better than this one in quality. Noise isolation is the best I have used. You stick these in your ear, you will not hear a truck coming your direction. Not recommended for jogging on the street."
5,"If you demand THE BEST, get Shure SE530!","This headphone is simply amazing. Since many people have touched on details about the headphones, may I just say that this IS the BEST one I've tried so far! I've owned isolating headphones as follow; Etymotic ER-6 > Shure SE200 > Ultimate ears Pro 5 > then finally Shure SE 530!!! and yes, it is THAT nice...I feel like I'm in heaven when I have these cans on me outside! lol I don't need any other headphones but my AKG K701 for home, Shure SE530 for outdoor! Thanks to technology!"
2,"Great sound, poor design","I bought the Shure SE530 earphones and was surprised by its excellent sound, but after 10 months, sound became distorted. Since they were under warranty, I sent them to Shure, and began a tortuous seven month process, after which, they sent me a replacement. The product worked great for a year and broke again; and considering the nightmare I went through the first time they broke, I decided to throw them away and get a more customer conscious product. In general, great sound, poor cable design and lousy support."
2,"Sound Great; Wires, Bad!","The sound on the Shure 530 earbuds is very good, but the wires are very bad, especially for the price. After less than 10 months the wires became stiff, even a little brittle. After 11 months the connections at the earbuds and wires became frayed, even without mistreatment. I would not buy these earbuds again. Very disappointing, given what I paid for them."
5,BEST EARPHONES MONEY CAN BUY,I have tried many in-ear headphones including custom pair costing over $1000. These are the warmest and most natural sounding headphones I have heard.
3,Lacks Bass,"I have to say that I was a bit disappointed with the overall sound quality when I received this. The highs and mids are strong but lacks bass!! For what I paid, I did expect more! If I had to do it all over again, I would look at the Klipsch headphones....I know they are much stronger in bass (I love strong bass). Bottom line, if you like sharp, crisp and clear and don't require much bass, these are fine. They are very comfortable and seam to be durable and do a good job with shutting out the outside noise. I am just disappointed with the lack of bass."
3,Great sound but wire broke,"I spent a lot of money on these ($350+) and treated them with kid gloves, yet the wire wore down and broke at the ear bud connection point. they are out of warranty now and cost to repair is $145.Is it worth paying this and potentially have the same thing happen again in such a short time. Very disappointed in the return on investment.Great product but will buy a better value pair next time"
4,Great sound but fragile,Love these things but the wires suck. They're too big and heavy and after a while the inevitable fraying from the earbuds and middle connector will happen and you'll have to send them back to Shure for their cold and expensive service dept to sort out. For $500 I expect better. Oh - the service fee - $145. There's a high price for audio perfection.
3,Cute but slightly defective,"Good design--soft easy-care fabric, snaps down the legs for easy diaper change, etc. Cute as it could be but the embroidered ""Li'l Stinker"" read ""Li l Sti er."""
2,Not 100% cotton,"The one I received is 2T and the label says that it is 60% cotton and 40% polyester, made in Pakistan. I am going to return it, because I was looking for a 100% cotton outfit but will describe the outfit for the review's sake.The metal snaps go down one leg but not all the way. the snaps are on a ""snappy tape"" which is rather bulky. There is a square of fabric with skunk embroidery and words ""Lil' Stinker"" attached in the back were the baby's bottom is. The seams around this square are very bulky. There are also three decorative snaps on the upper seam adding to the bulk.It looks true to size before washing, I did not wash it since I am planning to return it."
2,"Too many ""borrowed"" themes, from wrong eras no less","Magnus Fiennes supposedly took traditional Russian melodies and incorporated them into score for better authenticity. Nice and commendable. Problem is, that the certain themes he used without giving credits are not ""traditional"". They have specific authors and were written long after the movie takes place. For example, ""Onegin's theme"" and ""Name day waltz"" are both practically identical to the song ""Na sopkah Manchjurii"" composed in early 1900s by Ilja Shatrov. In the movie (not included on soundtrack CD) characters sing ""Oi tsvetet kalina"", written in 1949 for a well-known movie. Having Pushkin's characters singing this song is as ridiculous as having them wear jeans, for example."
4,D'India by Chiaroscuro,"The 5 movement cycle ""Se tu, Silvio crudel"" from d'India's 8th book is brilliantly and dramatically performed by a really super ensemble. A vocal score can be obtained via e-mail to orders@olschki.it"
5,Monarchy,A bit too much of David Starky and not enough of views and re-enactments to hold my kids attention. shame.
3,U381 UIFTech,It works on pre 2003 American and other foreign cars. It does not work on cars there after. No options to upgrade software.
1,Never worked for me,"I have a 2001 Chevy S-10 and when I connected it I got a ""No link"" message. I also tried it on my 2009 Hyundai Santa Fe and got a ""link error"" message. So I have two vehicles and it struck out on both."
4,Billboard Hot R&B Hits 1989 review,This CD had a could collection of songs from the year 1989. Some that I hadn't had. I am happy to get it and the condition it was in.
4,FINALLY -- AN ACTUAL READING JOURNAL,"It's amazing to me that no one has yet to publish a reading journal that actually has enough room to write a review of a book. This journal has finally done it. It has plenty of pages to put your favorite quotes from the book, a page for group discussion questions and two pages for notes or reviews. My only complaint is that it can only be used for 18 books. That's OK if you're really only using it for a reading group journal because most groups pick one book a month but if you want to use it as your regular reading journal and you read in excess of 18 books a year, you're out of luck. I'd like to see this book have space to record 75 books and forget about all the other stuff that's included."
5,Pleasing Reading Companion,This journal was given to me as a gift. Being a college student I didn't have time to even open it. So I gave it to my mother and it has become her constant companion. She picks it up the minute she finishes a book and she isn't even in a reading group. She has promised to give it to me as a keepsake as soon as it is completed. It is a lovely sweet book.
5,A good idea for Reading Groups,I just found this book but already I have used it to record some of my notes from books my reading group read this year. It also has lot of suggested reading lists which my group might be interest in. I had no idea this book was even around even though it was published a few years ago. I wish I had had it two years ago when my reading group started out.
4,My favorite C.B. Cooney,"I think Among Friends is my favorite Caroline Cooney book because it's the one Cooney book that I can relate to the most. All the main characters, from brainy Jenny to fashionable Hilary, are teenagers, and unlike most the situations in Cooney's other books, in almost all the events I can imagine myself in them. From each journal entry to the next, Cooney masterfully crafted a tale of hardship, love, ambition, and other high school emotions. The one thing I would have liked better was for the book to have been in an impersonal third person omni. point of view, because all the 1st point of views were sometimes conflicting, leading to confusion.Still all in all, it was a terrific book."
5,"utterly, frighteningly true","Everything about this book is brilliant--the world it portrays is a bit foreign to me, but I recognize it. I found the way it was written just as gripping as the content.I think this was the first Cooney I read and definitely the one that will always make me think of her as a good writer, no matter what she churns out (that doesn't mean I have to READ all that other stuff, though!) I think it's a shame that this one, which actually means something, apparently isn't read much."
4,Among Friends,"This book is absolutely amazing. Everyone around the world wants to be like Jenny, popular, taltened, intelligent, but we find out that beneath the surface things aren't always what they seem. Perfection isn't happiness, a lot of the time it isn't perfect at all. This book will inspire you to be more tolerant of those who seem to have everything and through the voices of 'ordinary' people you will find that being average is often the most extarordinary thing of all."
4,Among Friends,"Among Friends is a good book for teenagers in high school. It is interesting in the way it deals with real-life situations that happen in school.This book is about a group of kids in high school that keep diaries for one of their classes. It is intriguing to see how they all respond to different situations. Mainly, the story is about the ""awesome threesome"", Jennie, Hillary, and Emily. They were the best of friends until high school, when jealousy split them up. Jennie, always being perfect at everything she did got to Hillary and Emily, and made them despite her. What Hillary and Emily didn't know is that Jennie was going through a hard time. Jennie wanted to be perfect to make her parents proud, but if she did that, her friends would dislike her.I liked this book because I could relate to the situations that happened in the book. I given this book four stars and highly recommend it."
2,So-so book,"Gerd Luddeman sees Paul as responsible for what has become Christianity, far overshadowing Yeshua bar-Yosef if not completely burying his original teachings and goal. True enough. Paul certainly is responsible for the creation of the demon, Christianity, and its endless struggle to destroy God's People in order to inhabit its corpse.There are many books over the years writing of Paul and his evil, including the first I read, The First Christian, by Davies, (ages ago after finding it as a little paperback ready to fall apart). It was helpful in my escape from the church. But there are other better exposes of Paul. And so my reading of this rather pedestrian work by Luddeman was disappointing.If you have not read much criticism of Paul of Tarsus, then you might benefit from the book and not find it too earth-shattering. Try The Mythmaker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity, by the late Hyam Maccoby."
2,Another Ghost Dance?,"Killing Custer starts out lame and limps along like a horse with three shoes! The Author has a good opportunity to present a Native American viewpoint on a great battle (Native American vs the White Anglo) but choose to wander and bounces from personal grudges to mythical happening to political agendas! As this book progress, the reader is left with the feeling that the material being presented is inadequate to make a complete book and that the author adds side-bars to flesh out the copy. Little new information is added to the existing knowledge and most of the material presented is tainted with the political subtones of the author. To bad... as this book could have been a good one for the library!"
4,INDIAN VIEW OF LITTLE BIGHORN,"The value of this book lies in the ability to present the Indians as humans rather than the evil savages ingrained into most American s during the 19th and 20th centuries.Mr. Welch succeeds in showing the indecision and doubt that plagued Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse during the latter years of the Plains War. The passages explaining the negative aftermath of the Little Bighorn for the Plains Indian because it is overlooked or ignored by history books.I thought Mr. Welch's decison to weave the Little Bighorn into the story of making the film about the battle made the book more interesting. It allowed the inclusion of unrelated items, such as the gravesite of Bill Thomas, which provided additional background to some of the major points of the book.It is an interesting and easy read that would be enjoyable to anyone slightly interested in Custer, Little Bighorn or the Plains Indians."
4,I liked the the perspective the author gives on Custer.,"A very fresh point of view on an almost mythical historical figure. The author shows that Custer had been blessed with more luck than ability, and his luck ran out. The author also did a great job of telling how the death of Custer was also the death of the Souix nation."
1,"Good effort, but...","The author perhaps should confine his efforts to Blackfeet history ---rather than stretching to include them in a theatre in which they had no part.If anything was interesting in this book, it would have to be how Custer continues to shape the identities of those who have agendas to push and paradigms to sell. Certainly, the historical perspective was biased to the point that it became just more stereotypical static."
3,"decent, but not perfect","I've had this shaver for several years and two blade replacements. Previous reviewer is correct about the cleaning aspect of this razor, it's a little difficult to get everything out. That being said, it didn't effect the performance.Overall, it gave a decent shave for a three-head rotary shaver.Pros:Holds a decent charge even after 3+ years of use.Quick charge allows you to shave even after a few minutes of chargeCons:Trimmer closes too easily in use. Have to have finger against opening mechanism if using for a longer periodCloser shave would be nice, but it does okay, clean shaven for 8+ hours"
2,It's a shaver BUT can't shave closely and impossible to clean,"I've had this shaver for about 4 years, until it just died today. While it performed as a shaver overall, I do have gripes about it. Don't have much to compare with except a manual blade so that's why I give it 2 stars.Major issue is cleaning maintenance. It is virtually impossible to clean the head. The shaver comes with a small brush, but the hair folicals easily get stuck into the rotors. Once they are inside past the blades and carrying space, they can't be removed.Another issue is it doesn't have that close of a shave. It always is unable to get the hair at the corner of my cheeks near my jaw. Very irritating.For the price, it's not that well made. I'm looking into a shaver which can clean itself in hopes that cleaning will preserve it's lifespan."
5,Need this book if you are going to do it yourself,"Although pricey, I would recommend buying this book if you plan to put in radiant floor heating yourself. I looked at the other books which just scratched the surface and found this one was a complete guide to what I needed. Don't waste your money on the others unless you just want some general information.The author of this book knows what he's writing about."
5,"Well written resource, covers the bases very thoroughly","Great book. Not all the way through it yet, but giving me more confidence to do my own radiant heat project. Heat loss calcs not a big mystery any more. Minor lack of detail clarifications when it comes to underslab foam insulation options. EPS--Expanded foam is perfectly acceptable alternative (and cheaper) than XPS--Extruded, when ordered to engineered compressive strength requirements. Otherwise it is giving me excellent ideas for doing my job right the first time. Don't be disuaded by cost of book. Value is there in spades--included CD is very nice."
5,This is not enough !!!!!!!!,"The fact that they never recorded anything else has been bothering me since i first bought this 45 when it came out. I heard it once on k-roq, when to Zed records in Long Beach and bought it. I was AMAZED to see it on cd. Theres only one other band i can think of that should have recorded more and thats Spitting Teeth."
4,Tom and Jerry Greatest Chases vol.4,I grew up on Tom and Jerry watching them as I ate my cereal before walking to school. Now in 2011 my 3yr old daughter saw a few reruns recently and now she loves Tom and Jerry so I bought this dvd for her. She watches it over and over and over and over...lol So I would say she gives it 2 thumbs up !!!
2,Seedier side of life,"This book was flat out depressing. The characters in the book are all typical ""trailer trash"" with no hope of better lives."
4,So interesting,"I must agree with another reviewer that said she was emotionally invested in these characters and felt that the ending did not do them justice. I felt that the conclusion rolled along too quickly without the crystal clear detail that made the rest of the novel so enjoyable. Perhaps the author is planning a sequel- I certainly feel that there is more story here to be told. This said, I found this book incredibly moving and realistic. Another Amazon reviewer said that the scenes of rape and alcoholism are degrading; I could NOT disagree more. I wish no one had to deal with such terrible trauma but that is life and it is handled very well in this novel. My favorite characters, beside spunky and worn-out Darla, are Elijah and Pearl. There is much here to discuss and become fascinated by. I highly recommend this novel."
4,grear read. You really get into the characters lives.,"Story of a woman, Darla, living in a small town caled Paradise. She does some flashbacks into childhood, often about the wretched life she had. Her life does improve somewhat. You meet a cast of characters that you fall in love with while others you just HATE!! You'll be rooting for Darla all the way through."
2,Not What It Seems,"I bought this book thinking it would be a folksy story about life in a small town, and ladies enjoying their togetherness at the local bingo parlor. Something light and cheerful, and--- funny. This book is about as far away from funny as you can get. It is sad, pitiful, irritating, and the main characters are, without exception, all pretty unlikeable. Even Darla Moon,who tells the story and whose mother is the town prostitute, comes across as hard as nails. Underneath, of course, she has a heart, but she is so tough, it's hard to have any sympathy for her. The only likable characters are Elijah, a black friend of the family, and a preacher who sweeps Darla off her feet. It is NOT an easy read-- on every page there is something sad,-- these people live in squalor and hopelessness. I felt totally down in the dumps when I finished it. I wish I had my time back."
1,Awful !!!!,"I was very enthused about reading this book based upon the reviews and was very disappointed. If you think rape, prostitution, alcoholism, welfare, domestic abuse and child neglect are ""real life"", then you will enjoy it. I found the entire book to be depressing and something I will never read again. The book is well written and I would like to read another novel by this author if the story had more hope and joy. Too much misery in this one for me!"
5,A main character you care about.,I spent the first half of this novel getting to know Darla Moon. I spent the second half rooting for her. When's the sequel? I want to know what happened next.
1,The best part is the title,"This book was a huge disappointment all around. I understand that it is the author's first book, but that doesn't excuse the end result. It is as if the author put the sum total of Oprah's book club in a blender and cobbled a plot from the pieces.It really doesn't work. She can't seem to decide if she is going for a serious piece of literature, a dead-easy mystery, or a gratuitous bodice ripper complete with the most cliched and boring sex scenes ever. If it were better written, it would be depressing as heck. As it is, it is a complete waste of time, and the editor is just as culpable as the author.The best part about this book is the title. There are many, many other stronger options in a similar vein. Don't waste your time."
1,Bingo Queens of Paradise,"As a first time reader of June Park, I must admit to being horribly saddened by this effort of Ms. Park's. The story line was one of continuous abuse and degradation always directed toward the helpless. As an avid reader of stories of the south,and a proud resident of the south this paints a poor picture of we southern females. Such a poor book I won't even share it with my reading group.I couldn't bear to finish it. I read for entertainment and enlightenment not depravity."
1,Not a book I would recommend,"This book has a lot of hard, degrading moments about rape, abuse and alcoholism. I did not enjoy reading it, and would not recommend it to my friends."
1,Pathetic Characters,"I often enjoy reading books about characters that I have nothing in common with. However, I highly recommend avoiding this book unless you get some ununsal pleasure out of reading about, and I am sorry to have to use this language, ""complete white trash""."
4,Could be depressing,"I'm undecided about this book.If you were in a down mood when reading it, the story of these poor pathetic characters could tumble you right over the edge but the author manages to keep you buoyed up with the faint hope that somehow,these drab, unfulfilled lived could be improved. The heroine, Darla, is trapped in an almost empty town with a sluttish mother who is the town prostitute and a pathetic weed of a sister who is married to a drunken,wife beating husband and despite her dreams of becoming a top fashion designer, is perpetually held back by a moral sense of responsibility to her family. I enjoyed the book in a funny sort of way but was almost relieved when it finished."
2,To be consulted after you have climbed your mountain.,"Yes, Bourneman and Lampert are good climbers. Too good! This is a text to consult after you have climbed your mountain. I suggest that you choose your route in ""Colorado's Fourteeners: From Hikes to Climbs"" by Gerry Roach. Bourneman often selects routes that are not appropriate for those who are not up to his ability. I have learned the hard way. After, 37 successful Colorado 14er climbs, I recommend Roach. You should also check Edrinn's ""Grand Slam"", and Ormes' ""Guide to the Colorado Mountains"". Bourneman and Lampert salvage two stars but only because their historical information is interesting."

2,Not the best guide,"I have used this guide as well as Roach(99) to climb most of the Colorado Fourteeners. This book has some interesting historical data, but has poor maps and lists only one route on most peaks. Roach's 1999 edition is far superior."
4,Great Overview With the Essential Information,"This is one of the earlier books on climbing Colorado's Fourteeners; before everyone was doing it. The book serves as my guide as I work on reaching all of Colorado's summits over 14,000 feet. For one mountaineer's specific tales of high adventure in the Colorado Rockies, read TJ Burr's ""Rocky Mountain Adventure Collection."""
2,Not one of Kaczmarek's best ..,"One of the previous raters called this CD ""beautiful beyond belief,"" an opinion I can't share. There are only a few melodic passages, but the rest are annoying, monotonous Cello pieces and a few equally annoying very high-pitched choir pieces. One of Kaczmarek's best film scores is probably the one for ""Unfaithful"" - which is truly ""beautiful beyond belief."" The ""Third Miracle"" can't hold a candle to it. Personally, I was very disappointed and did not think it was worth the money."
4,Second edition?,"I found this book at a whole sale book event and I thought it looked like a good. I hope they have a updated version of this book because there is so many dvds that are not in the book. Alot of dvds do deserve to be in this book. I highly enjoyed this book and even bought a few dvds that were reviewed in it. The only problem I have is the author seems to enjoy the background of movies instead of the movies. He always talks about the colors in the background and it just seems weird. Still, a very good book if you like dvds."
4,Undeniably great... Voodoo has done slightly better...,"Steadily stomping hard into a raging pit of guitars, horns, and ska-bop-slamming grooves, Voodoo makes the switch to Victory with style. While I still love the old releases a tiny bit more... This is Voodoo, tried and true, keeping it real just for you. As the CD ends I don't really have the need to press play again, meaning this does not leave me begging for more. Stands tall on it's own, but this is much more aggressive and downtrodden than I remember the Skulls being... A welcome addition to any VGS' fan out there, sturdy, stiff and erect as a flag. Was worth buying even if the only songs on it were: Voodoo Anthem, Steady As She Goes, and Nada En La Cabeza."
1,Quality Not Good,When I received these glasses I noticed the stem on one of them was a lot thinner than the other three. I washed them out in the sink and rinsed them. The paint peeled right off of the stem on two of them! I hadn't even used them yet. Does this company not have a quality department? I would not purchase these again.
2,Red Tint Washes Off,"I like the goblets a lot, but the red tint washed right off of some of them the first time I used them. I followed all care instructions and did not submerge/soak them in water. I gently soaped the insides and then rinsed the glasses with lukewarm water and the tint started to peel.For those wondering about the difference between these and older Pfaltzgraff sets, I noticed that some of my Pfaltzgraff items are made in China and some are made in Indonesia. The ones made in Indonesia seem to have brighter colors and better quality than the ones made in China."
1,Pfaltzgraff Winterberry Glass Goblet,"I have an almost complete set of the Pfaltzgraff Winterberry collection (plates, bowls, water goblets etc) but was short one 13 oz water goblet. I purchased a four pack in December before Christmas, and took the glasses out of the box to find one of the stems broken. I'd already thrown the box away, so there was no way for me to return them. I thought, ""no big deal, I only needed one more and ended up with 2 extra"" I washed the goblets by hand in warm soapy water, and the red paint on the stems litterally washed off, and swirled down the drain!!I'll have to purchase another box of 4 next year....maybe."
2,disappointed,"I was disappointed in this product. I found the red paint on the stemware came off when washed gentley with soap and water, ruining the look of the glass."
1,Poor Quality,"While these wine glasses look nice, before I even got them out of the boxes they started to lose the hand-painted designs. Before putting them in the Christmas China Cabinet, we rinsed them, 2 of them lost a part of the design. I thought to now pack them up 2 boxes and send them back is such a burden, that I'd live with it. When we set the dinner table for Christmas Eve, I noticed the tops of the stems were missing the red coloring and looked as if it was dripping off or peeling off. Complete waste of money. If I had the patience to send them back, I would, but the shipping cost would outweigh the benefit. They will all go in the garbage when the China cabinet goes back to normal China. I believe these should be sold in a dollar store. You expect that from a dollar store glass. That is where these glasses belong. Complete garbage.Pfaltzgraff Winterberry 13-Ounce Glass Goblets, Set of 4"
2,Bad paint job!,"We all thought they were so pretty and festive. However, when they were washed, for use, the red paint on the stems, peeled off. I now, have to return them, and we are very disappointed in them."
1,Save Your Money,"You'll be wasting your money if you purchase these glasses. I did not realize that ""Hand Painted"" meant that there is no top glaze over the paint. I took them out of the box and gentlty washed them and I had red berries on my hand. Really poor quality for the Pfaltzgraff name."
5,Arrived safely,I bought two sets of these and they both arrived in great condition and right on time.
3,Off the beaten track,"I have only listened a couple of times so I'll start with that. JPJ and Paul(?) Thomas create some great groove work on this disc - I bought it based on the first (only?) pairing of these two musicians who I have always enjoyed. Diamanda's vocalizations and lyrics are well, disturbing in a number of of songs. I am sure that they are meant to shock a bit (and I personally took no offense), but I expect it is an acquired taste that may develop over several listenings. Its quite a mix (experimental?) as there are a few straight-up type tunes where I think Diamanda is playing the Hammond organ in a bluesy almost gospel-esque type of tune. If you like music that is off the beaten track, this might be for you."
5,Cercy Meets Mr Jones,"Fill in the blanks with all the other, provers of the grove Riff! This is a F*#King Awesome record, Squeamish need not tread on the taboo, um of a pissed of Woman! These two make the angels hide their halos, Buy it, rock to it, and all the quacking d emasculated, intimidated, fools Get over it! this is Brilliant Balls out Rock!"
4,ROCKIN' MAMA!,"I had to listen to the samples over to refresh my mind since I hadn't listen to this cd in about 3 yrs. I still like this cd- she whigs out. Diamanda does the middle-eastern vocalizing style very well. But not as good or pleasant sounding as the late OFRA HAZZA. You all know Diamanda has to give it her deconstructed trademark sound/style. ""MY BABY'S INSANE"" appears on the ""LA SERPENTA CANTA"" cd and ""SOKOSETEME"" appear on ""DEFIXIONES, WILL and TESTAMENT."" The tracks are fun and Diamanda proves to everyone that she can take on rock music and sound fabulous. Her voice is well suited for rock. I really can't over analyze the music- it's just plain fun to listen if this is the type of you music you like."
3,Excessive but hypnotic,"An acquired taste in vocals if ever there was one, Galas definitely milks her unnerving style past any complimentary stylistic choice into overbearing realms, yet the atmospheric music and her technical prowess assure the disc is more than an avant-garde indulgence."
1,Yoko Ono was never this tone deaf!,"I bought this from Amazon, without listening to the preview samples, which I now regret most deeply! Luckily it was a used copy and inexpensive.John Paul Jones is a genius on bass and other instruments. If you want to hear him, skip this album, because Diamanda will ruin it for you. (Pick THUNDERTHIEF or ZOOMA or Led Zeppelin for that matter.)Caterwauling is too kind a term. She sings Middle Easter microtones without stopping on any particular tone. Screeching and yodeling abound. Honestly, this one I'll give away to anyone who'll take it (unless the record company releases a dub version!).It sounds like someone beating a cat to death with another cat."
2,Pass the ear plugs please!,"This would be a great album...if she wouldn't sing. Believe me, I tried listening to this with an open mind, but couldn't get past her howls and screeches. The only reason I purchased it was to hear J.P. Jones."
2,Could be better,"This book is fine if you're only looking for fun, fluffy info. If you are a dedicated follower of Chinese astrology, you'd be better off not taking this book too seriously (or maybe not reading it at all). There are countless errors in interpretation, and the author would do well to concentrate on more research the next time around, and less on trite generalizations based on her personal experiences. Other books I would recommend from Amazon instead of this one: any of the Theodora Lau books, and definitely the Taoist Astrology ones."
1,"""Tip of the Iceburg"" Astrology","Unfortunatly, for many of us who are searching for insights into Chinese Astrology, this book offers very little understanding about Chinese Astrology in its true form. The subjective material in White's books only foster more confusion and further divide readers from the true application of Chinese Astrology. This book can contribute to 5% of an individual's astrological profile at the most. Suzanne White's books in general are poor attempts of self-discovery through the art of Astrology."
1,Suzanne White definitely has an ego,"True that Suzanne White is very concerned with bragging about who she knows and generally talking about herself. Very egocentric. As for the astrology it may not be the most accurate scientifically but as far as entertaining, I found it so. Suzanne's greatest strength may be her intuition about the people in her surroundings. I believe the book is not geared to accuracy but more for entertainment and it should be taken as such."
3,Send For The Editor,"This is an interesting read which provides some insight from an African perspective on the turbulent recent history of Uganda. I have a few quibbles, first the book needs some more editing.The author tends to repeat some abstruse words such as ""diaphanous"" and ""patina"" at numerous and, at times, inappropriate moments throughout the book. Secondly, once the author leaves Uganda the story becomes very uninteresting very quickly. Otherwise a very good read."
3,Vectorman 2 Review,I bought this game as a collection piece therefor have no removed it from the cellophane packaging ALTHOUGH I have played the game before hand. The gameplay is a bit sluggist but still fun to play but no match for the origional. It's definately worth a few hours of your time to check it out if not only to just mess around on a decent side-scroller. Overall I give it an average rating but within the same thought it is also a must try.
2,"not worth its weight in salt, and it aint heavy","This is NOT an interesting project. Fans of Can, particularly people who really like their more daring/obscure stuff, are not going to be pleased by this turgid 2-slab waste. There are a few good moments -- yeah, Eno's take on ""Pnoom"" is cute, and sooo much longer than the original (heh) -- but in general this is one to pass on. Coulda been great -- I think they were hoping to market Can to people who actually, like, go dancing. Unbelievable what some people will do for money."
5,Great collection of music for anyone,"First off, Amazon needs to fix the album title to have ""Putumayo Kids Presents"" so it'll show up when you are searching through the series.A great, great CD. Our 15 month old loves it and unlike some other kids albums I don't sick of hearing these songs. It includes recordings from over a 50 year span and they are all very, very fun. I really wouldn't even say this is ""children's music"". This really is just a collection of great music that children should enjoy."
4,Not for PC's or laptops,Believe the other review about PC's or laptops. The cable might work fine for other home electronics outputting the correct resolutions but even with Windows Vista I couldn't get this to spit out the correct resolution. My video card should be more than capable of outputting a 720p compatible resolution but the cable/hardware recognition won't let me select the 1368x720 resolution.
4,Computer connection to HDTV,I have a new computer with DVI video output which I wanted to connect to my larger HDTV LCD screen. I needed this adapter cable (plus an extension HDMI cable) to make the connection. Works great. Only problem is that DVI does not cary the audio as it would have had I had an HDMI output on my computer.
4,Works but..,"I purchased this cable to connect a PC to Samsung S4095D HDTV. And the cable worked great; but.. be warned that connecting PCs to HDTVs (via DVI/HDMI) is fraught with lots of pain. The main problem is that the PC desktop is cut off so the borders are not visible; not a problem in movies, but totally breaks games.While you will find lots of people on internet forums who have ""made it work"", I spent days twiddling drivers and settings and never managed to make it work. The difficulty in making this work seems to be some (undocumented) property of the HDTV. In my case, I assumed that ""has HDMI port"" meant that I could use this cable to make DVI work.In the end I switched back to using a VGA cable which looks fine and worked the first time.So, the cable worked and was cheap; but it may not be the right solution to the problem (connecting a PC to your HDTV) which one would think is its primary purpose of existence."
3,HDMI to DVI Digital Video Cable (Blue),I bought a new vista computer and I wanted to connect my graphics card to my big screen TV. So i bought this cable. The connection was easy though in the past I have ruined the pin making the connection. Compared to that this was easy. The video is great compared to my S video connection. but the image appears unstable it will black out intermittently. I have not figured out the cause yet.
5,The best of the best,"I have, and have also listened to, a lot of Mina CDs, but this one is the best. It incorporates not only her brilliant styling, but the songs themselves are all of a piece: drama, high drama. Approaching a kind of drag queen intensity, Mina's interpretations leave you breathless and begging for more. All of the 60s songwriting, arrangements, and musicianship (rivaling the best of early Striesand, but more pop - think Dusty Springfield) are much better and more fun than a lot of her later, disco-pop recordings. Essential!"
4,I love it!,Tha t's what my little niece said when she saw it on the skype! She is looking forward to my arriving in Spain. It will be her birthday's present. She is only unhappy I couldn't get one of her favourite characters: Aelita.
3,"Another quick, enjoyable read in ""Tek"" world","Yes, I bought the first Tek book, TekWar because it was written by William ""Captain Kirk"" Shatner. But I've continued buying the rest of the series because I actually enjoy the novels. They are fun to read, interesting characters, enough plot twists to keep interest but also simplistic enough to not lose you. They are also very quick reads which are always nice. I always feel like I'm sucked in quickly, experience the book at high speed, and then finish it off feeling resolved and pleased to have enjoyed it so quickly. Some people might feel ripped off for going through it so quickly, but not me. I enjoy it and will continue to buy all of Shatner's future Tek books. This is the third novel in the series."
4,These shoes really fit!,"This was my very favorite book as a child. Its ability to transport you to a wonderful world and still be able to relate to its characters was a true joy. I loved all the ""Shoe"" books but this was my very favorite and I read it several times until the librarian at school made me return it. Subsequently I tried in vain to emulate the back flips and tumbles the characters in the book so effortlessly master. This book speaks to the heart of the child. I have passed it on to my daughter and she has found the magic in the ""Shoes"" as well. Find it, read it, pass it on."
5,Another of the wonderful SHOES books,"Do you remember when the Meg Ryan character walked into Tom Hanks' FOX BOOKS store and the customer asked about the ""Shoes"" books, and a monologue about the wonders of Noel Streatfeild's ""Shoes"" books ensued, touching on Dancing Shoes, Ballet Shoes, and Skating Shoes, which is absolutely wonderful? That scene made me break down crying, because I had never heard anyone other than myself talk about these terrific books, and the fact that it is tragic that they are mostly out of print and hard to find. This book is a wonderful story of working hard for a goal, and accomplishing it, or at least getting on the road to achieving a reasonable, yet magical, goal. If you want a great book for your favorite elementary school girl, buy this one - then buy the other ""Shoes"" books (and get a copy of Tennis Shoes for your favorite boy too!)"
2,circus shoes,"Despite the fact that I love the Shoes books, I found this one completely one-dimensional and dull. The author is at her best, I think, when she is creating characters who excel at theater or ballet. Though she did an adequate job describing the Big Top, that the two protagonists run away from home to join their uncle at, all the characters were paper thin, including the protagonists. The only thing we learn about the girl is that she has long blonde hair, and the boy does not even rate a physical description. We learn that they're sheltered, but they don't really change from beginning to end. I much prefer Dancing Shoes, Tennis Shoes or Theater Shoes."
5,Lectures on Modern and Postmodern Themes,These are lectures given in an actual college classroom: The Masters of Suspicion; Heigegger and the Rejection of Humanism; Habermas; Focault and the disappearance of the human; Derrida and the ends of man; Fatal Strategies.
4,THE CHILD DEVIANT!,"I really can't complain too much here. This is verry well produced EBM band that hail from Argentina (I think), or maybe it's Mexico (not certain). The lyrics are in spanish. Anyways,the music sounds like they took Hocico and VnV Nation and threw them into a blender. Tada!! You get Punto Omega. I find it to be pretty cool. I don't think it's the most brilliant band in the scene, but I can't say anything bad about them either."
3,"24"" height, not 32""","I received 2 stools and discovered they were only 24"" height. Amazon shipped out 2 more next day air and I received the same thing. There must have been an error in the item description. They looked nice and are made well. Since I liked the stools, and I already had them, I asked if they would consider a discount for two of them. The best they offered was 25% off, so I said I would think about it. I called back a couple days later and the customer service rep. said they would give me a 50% discount for the inconvenience."
4,Nice surprise,"Just moved into a really nice new home with a breakfast bar. Barstool prices are very high. Found these on Amazon and took a chance. They are more than I expected and look really great. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that one of the stools showed up with chipped wood and the stool toggles a bit. Otherwise, these are the bomb!"
1,Took forever to get!!!!,I don't have this item yet but I placed the order over 3 weeks ago and its not here. I got all my other books from other users but this is taking away too long.
5,shareable,I enjoy reading this author and easily pass the books around to friends to enjoy as well. They are well received. Dancing lizard
3,chicken soup style stories for the soul,Nice short stories with morals at the end. A humorous small book that touches the soul and warms the heart.
2,Misleading,"Only the forward was by Paul Harvey, Jr. Very misleading. The book is okay but I was expecting it to be written by someone else!"
4,Observations of life with a touch of humor,"Philip Gulley serves as the pastor of a small Quaker church. He was asked to write something for the church newsletter which he did, little suspecting that some of his writing would end up in the hands of Paul Harvey who read it on his radio show. This book is a compilation of the essays that Gulley wrote for his church newsletter. They contain his observations of life summed up in chapters such as ""My Cup Runneth Over, and So Does My Toilet"" which I'm sure many readers can identify with. His wry humor is evident throughout the book as is the genuine compassion he has for other people."
5,Life should be so simplistic,"Kinda like the story about being handcuffed to his son! I still have to laugh about it and some of the other down to earth stories. It was good to have a simple book to read. Almost too simple. Front Porch Tales, is priceless."
5,Industrial music for people who don't like industrial music,"It's usually very disappointing when an experimental band releases an album of ""accessable"" music, but in this case there's nothing but good news. This recording is lush, tuneful and filled with beauty (and also almost entirely in English, with surprisingly good results). It's a long way from ""Halber Mensch"" territory, but hardcore EN fans need not be afraid: this is a wide-ranging, strong recording with plenty of new noise. The lyrics are less claustrophobic than Blixa's normal fare, but more universal in scope. Buy it if only for the English version of ""Interimsliebenden""."
1,NOT DISHWASHER SAFE,I should have taken the time to read through the other reviews because I made the mistake of another seller and put these scoops in the dishwasher in an attempt to get the price stickers off. All of the metal coating washed off and they came out dark gray and totally ruined. These would have been fine if I had just washed by hand.
1,Very Dissapointed,"Not only was the shipping more expensive on this than two lamps and a shoe rack I bought from other vendors, the price sticker was impossible to remove. I attempted to clean it in the dishwasher, and all the chrome washed off."
1,"Scoop is ok, but can't remove the adhesive!","The scoop is the right size, it's light weight aluminum with a shiny finish. At $2.70 it seemed a bargain. Shipping was $5.94...kinda high, but at $8.64 total, I figured - sure why not. It arrived in two days...super! BUT I CAN'T GET THE ADHESIVE LABEL OFF! I tried soaking it in hot soapy water - the paper came off leaving the adhesive behind. Next was Goof Off - my fingers were blackened but the sticky adhesive was still there. Straight acetone - nada. So I'm left with a cute, little, VERY STICKY scoop. I'd send it back but I'm not going to invest another penny in this thing. Drat!"
4,The Door Swings Two Ways,"This was my first experience of reading a book by this author and I found it most enjoyable. Mr. Heinlein made a questionable story into an entertaining story with a mascot that would normally have nothing to do with the plot or be comfortable with being involved in such a unique situation. But, he fit and one felt that the cat belonged. The story was within ones imagination maybe even plausible..."
5,"Heinleins, ""Door Into Summer""","Good, classic science fiction by one of the old masters. Recommended reading for anyone who has discovered the genre. It's a little dated, but then I was young when I read it the first time, a long time ago. I was quite happy to add it to my growing Kindle library."
4,The Door Into Summer,"The first time I read this book was over 40 years ago. While some of the details in the book seem to be a bit of a stretch now, the general story line made for a fast read. While I had forgotten details of the story, the gist of the story was as good as I remembered. Being a minor fan of Heinlein, I was pleased to find this title available for Kindle. For anyone new to Science Fiction, I heartily recommend this book."
4,Classic Heinlein,"A fun read but dated quite a bit. Although not much older than the protagonist would have been in the 1970s the language and phrasing is from an older era. It's ironic that Heinlein's character comments about the irony of dressing his 1970s character in a 1900s suit that would have been common in the character's grandfather's time. Several of his phrases were out of date before I was born in the late 50s.The basic storyline is a Heinlein classic, simplistic, easy to follow, some might find it anachronistic. Female readers may find his characterizations of female characters misogynistic - I honestly believe it is more his time referent than anything else and is pretty common in most of his books."
5,A lighter favorite,"Less weighty than his longer works, but written with the skill and insight that shines in his softer sci-fi. Still, it makes you think about your life, what you'd change if you could have a 'do-over.' A fairly quick read for a winter weekend day."
4,Highly enjoyable,You need not be a Science Fiction fan to like this book. I don't often read SF but I found this book to be good read--lots of fun.
4,My favorite Heinlein book,"I think I read the door into summer for the first time in the early 70's. I have always loved this book, and it is one that I re-read often since I get such a kick out of it. I am amazed that here it is almost 60 years after the book was written, and the useful household robot is still not a reality. Come on engineers, this is a winning invention. Heinlein's ""Drafting Dan"", the computerized drafting table is the precursor to all of the CAD programs that are used every day by architects and engineers, and one of the inventions in the book is the self cleaning cat litter box, predecessor of the Litter Maid. I just wish someone out there would get it together on the robot. The story was fun, and still is, even after all these year. If you like Heinlein, or even if you dont, buy this book."
4,Enjoyable Time Travel Story,"A pleasant and enjoyable light read, set against a time travel back drop. Good character development, love Pete the cat! Would make a good movie."
5,old scifi,Another book I read a long time ago. Cool story line. I liked the way the writer tried to make the future so futuristic. With the tech they had then he was pretty far out there. Funny that they could forsee cell phones and such. Still a good read.
5,read it NOW!!,"Heinlein wrote this story on late 50s. The story setting starts on 70s and goes to early 2000s. If you lived through 70s and 2000s, you will see how brilliant he was not only as a writer but as a scientist. It is 2010 and I consider the book is having its primely time to be read."
3,A man who loves his cat,"This was a bathroom book at work; I hadn't read it in years, but really liked the opening bit. The rest of it, now, I find is less clever than I thought it was then. Maybe because I've seen a lot more time travel plots since then, maybe not. Anyway, the cat is awesome, and the sexism is a lot less pronounced than in some of his other early works, and only a little creepy. Product of its times and all, and I still vote 'good way to spend my spare time'."
4,One classic from Heinlein,"This is among the best from the Granddaddy of them all in modern Science Fiction. Read any Heinlein you can find, if you haven't already. If you find one that doesn't suit you, go to the next. There are enough great books by Heinlein for everyone to find some to their taste."
4,Reading pleasure,"Admittedly, I'm a Heinlein fan but still it's a great little story. If you like cats it contains some absolutely magnificent observation pertaining to animal husbandry or rather human catry. If you read the story for the first time, maybe you'll feel that it is a bit old hat, bur keep in mind, that Heinlein more or less made that hat with this story. A sci-fi classic."
3,The Door Into Summer,"Reviewing to see if it is a book I would get for someone else. It is interesting, but not everyone would like it. I haven't finished reading it yet, but will."
3,Enjoyable,"While the technology surrounding the robot invention is dated (mid-50's), and the subject of time travel is always a bit gimmicky, this is a fun book to read. I found the characters interesting, and the main character's plight especially so. I also thought the cat's role in the book was well-written and interesting. The idea of suspended animation is well done, and thankfully the subject of time-travel is not overdone. If the robot technology wasn't so lame, and the book was longer, it could have rated 4 stars."
5,One of Heinleins smaller books,"But it's one that I keep coming back to. In the middle, Heinlein offhandedly invents Computer Aided Design. As a minor plot point.Not nearly as well known as ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress"" ""Friday"" ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" etc, but worth space on your shelf."
3,Engineer as ideal man,"From a personal standpoint I rate it a 5. I recall it fondly from childhood and have enjoyed rereading it multiple times since.As fiction, a 3. Good story, clean writing, some nice phrases and ideas.Mostly, it is a period piece now. A view to the gee-whiz feeling of the 50s that honest American engineering -- specifically not science -- could solve any problem."
2,Underwhelming,"I don't know if this is a case of the Emperor's New Clothes, but I was expecting a lot more from the reviews here. I am a time travel fan, and can't understand how anyone can rank this above Replay, Time and Again, Up the Line, Time Traveler's Wife or 11/22/63, to name a few. Perhaps I am being tough on Heinlein, but his 1950s view of both 1970 and 2000 were further off than i would have imagined. High expectations hurt my read as much as the mediocre execution."
2,"Might have been good, but...","I bought these for the purpose of audio engineering and maybe some DJ work on the side, but they came to me broken in the package. I'm unsure as to audio quality thanks to this, but the switches seem poorly made. Specifically one of the club switches was broken off, something that looked like it would have been hard to do since the the headphones were supposedly ""new"". If it really is that easy to break them, then I'd advise you to get a different set. I returned these for a pair of Sennheiser headphones."
5,This is the best bra I have ever worn,"I have 2 on order, because they didn't have my size, and I'm teling you that you hardly know that you're wearing it except that you suddenly feel secure without restricted. I have extremely sensitive skin this bra doesn't irritate it one little bit, it's simply fabulous."
1,Not comfortable at all,I found this to be very uncomfortable - despite their claims! The material on the back above and below the hooks and eyes is almost sharp and stratches my back. The attachments on the front of the straps (where it attaches to the cups) is also irritating. I bought this because I have very sensitive skin and it definitely is not working for me. I have not worn it long enough at any one time to address any other plusses or minuses about this bra.
1,Don't waste your money!,"I purchased several of these bras 5 months ago. I loved them at first. The fit was great and totaly seamless, THEN the fabric started to strech, which I could live with, but about a month ago the strap on one of them broke. The other day it happened again on the black one. Apparently, the strap is not sewn onto the bra but rather fused with some sort of adhesive, which breaks. A $50 bra should last longer than 5 months. Don't waste your money."
4,2 year old loved this costume,My two year old daughter loved this costume! She is small for her age and it was a little tight around the wrists and arms so I recommend buy a slightly larger size.
2,Disappointing!,Costume was very disappointing! Size listed as 2T but was 18 months to 2-was smaller than expected. Fabric not great. Ended up buying a different costume elsewhere.
3,Not all folios by the same name...,"I was careful to check the songs included in the folio before clicking on links, as I needed specific songs for a recital. The folio that came to me did not have the titles that it promised. I'm glad that I bought it used because I could afford to buy the sheet music elsewhere online.This is not a complaint against the seller as much as whatever way amazon links titles. This was NOT the same thing as I originally was looking at."
3,great movie that fizzles in the end,"being a drummer i had to get this one..the storyline, although some might find strange..was entertaining to me, with a variety of characters introduced ...then it feels like the writer gave up on a decent ending with violence becoming the method of resolution..otherwise id rate it higher..however if youre an artist or are intersted in ""mystical"" happenings this may be one for you.."
5,Extremely versatile cymbal,"Just like the name implies, the Zildjian crash / ride can handly both roles. I tend to rely on it more for crashing than riding, but when I need a powerful washed out ride, this is 18"" beauty hits the mark. I love this thing for both the only suspended cymbal on a kit OR as the big fat power cymbal for a large kit."
4,Very good screwdriver,its better at driving screws in Hardwoods (BirdsEye-Maple) and plywoods then my 14.4v dewalt and 14.4v nimi makita drills
5,"Light, small and easy to use.",This item is great for those who want something small for the gym or working out. It holds enough music for a full workout and it is small and light enough to not interfere with whatever you are doing. You might want to purchase different headphones because the cord is short and the earbuds have a tendency to fall out. So buy earbuds that have a longer cable and hooks to wrap around the ears.
4,Wonderful...once you get past the software,"Beautiful design, highly functional, 2 hours of MP3's w/ no chance of skipping in one of the smallest units you can by. Eats AAA's pretty quick...8-10 hrs at most? And the software is not real intuitive and it tended to spontaneously shut down at the most awkward times. System 9 or less only support for Macs...perhaps it would be more stable once System X software comes out. Once you get past the longer than it should take downloading, it works flawlessly and sounds great. Upgrade the software and it would be a solid 5."
1,What a piece of crap!,Had it one day and made three calls to tech support- wouldn't take files- wouldn't do anything! Kept playing REM while not even in loop!
2,software is horrible,I don't like it because the PC software is absolutely horrible. Least intuitive Windows program I have ever seen.
2,Korean can't make mp3,"I bought it and 3 hrs later I decided to return it. Why?- It was easy to install the software into my computer, however cannot find the program that can transfer the file from computer to mp3, the program that was install in there was how to format.- No FM radio (well I know this when I first look at it)- The piece is small, but seem so fragile, felt like you can crash it by just holding it tight.- The design was good thou, small and convinent- Made my computer crashed, after installing the software- Not user friendly"
4,Great background informatin,"Although this book is heavy on pre-colonization tribes, it also has information from then to the present. In the center is an incredible map of all the tribes. Great for someone like me trying to narrow down possible tribal affiliation of ancestors."
5,Excellent and honest presntation of early east coast native cultures.,"The authors gave me a visibility into the ancient first nation that most have no knowledge that of, the early eastern native tribes. They were so much more agrarian than their mid western counter parts and had developed species of vegetables that changed the worlds food supplies."
4,Quick Informative Read,"Kaye and LeBrecht's book is a great introduction to the world of professional sound design for theatre. I am an experienced sound engineer and system designer, but was interested in learning the working procedures, protocol, and terminology that my colleagues in the theatre world are all used to. I got that plus some business advise for the independent contractor.It is a quick inspirational read, especially if you skip over most of the out-dated sections on audio technology and sound systems. I will hold onto this book, though, as a reference for things like sound cue plot diagrams.-Nathan[...]"
3,Be serious,"Two of the last three UMD's I've ordered from Amazon were just sliding around in their cases when they arrived. Because of it, the mount in the cases scratched them, one severly. And it's not the first time. While I was able to return those, others purchased elsewhere aren't always so easy. A tool like this is useful on such occasions (FYI: I own 86 UMD movies/games). As far as the 'screw' issue metioned by several others here, be serious. If you have that much trouble with a single screw, maybe you shouldn't be trying to remove scratches on your UMD's all by yourself."
4,GREAT QUALITY MUSIC,"THESE MERENGUES ARE CLASSIC! VERY GOOD QUALITY, YOU WILL ENJOY THEM LIKE WE HAVE. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. OH, AND PRINTED LYRICS ARE A PLUS."
4,"Long Cord, Nothing Fancy","This power strip is exactly as advertised. Long 15' cord to a 6 outlet strip. I would have prefered if the outlets were rotated 90 degrees, but its not a deal breaker.One plus the description didn't include when I was shopping is that the plug is an angled connector, with a face that sits close to flush with the wall and the cord comes off at a 45 degree angle. This is a great feature if you need to plug this in behind some furniture or something."
3,Not one of the author's better works,"I generally love Leigh Michaels books, but this one is not a keeper. It just didn't grab me like her books usually do. I didn't even bother finish reading it. It was just cliche romance writing. I knew how it would end without needing to read it all. I wouldn't waste my time or money on this book. Leigh Michaels has better books than this to choose from."
3,A realsitic story,"although being far from exciting, the story backwards honeymoon is so realistic and had a lot of common sense and logic in it. It shows a story of a rich girl falling in love with the gardener's son in the evening of her wedding to a gambler. The story then shows in details how the girl and the gardener's son managed to run away and how they were very logic and reasonable about ecery step they took."
2,Mikey's best but---,"That ain't saying much.I read this when it first came out and thought it was a scam but hey;sez I;give him the benefit of the doubt.But after reading his (it seems like monthly)subsequent books,I'm afraid my initial feeling was correct.The same book over and over and the suckers keep lining up for the next one.Good for you Mike.Keep scammin'em all the way to the bank.Pops would be proud.I see that Cammie has her own new book out now.Maybe one just for the ladies.Let me know if you guys need a ride to the bank.Just kiddin';I'm with you all the way."
3,mob in detail,husband request for xmas..he thought it was poorly written and shallow. Was thinking about reading the third book but not now
3,Starts Slow But has Clever Elements.,"The previous reviewer was a little hostile to this book, but I sort of liked it. It was hard for me to get into at first, but once I got into it there was much that was clever and original in it. The basic premise is that humans are living as vermin in an alien transportation system. They hitch rides on ships, and go back and forth between ships and warehouses, living off of the cargo. The entire system is automated, so we never see the actual aliens. Contrary to the other reviewer, we do not know that the Earth has been covered with boxes. The humans never go outside, so they never know what is outside. In feel, it reminds me of a certain John Brunner Book."
3,Pretty good - does the job,"In addition, by playing with the ""Keystone"" feature on the projector and buying a good ceiling mount (Mustang MV-PROJSP-FLAT ) I was able to lower the ""Image drop"" from 15 inches to 5 inches - took about 30 minutes but I got it.Instructions are awful but a little tech knowledge and you'll have her up and working.Product in the box does not match the picture - there is NO cable management with this mount - they have a little disclaimer that says they'll change product design at anytime - and they mean it!"
1,Not what I expected,"First, this does not come with the screws needed to mount it to the ceiling...a mount with no mounting screws. That was a shocker. Then, it didn't come with the screws that would fit my projector, though it did have quite a few to choose from. Also, the arms that attach to the projector and to the mount aren't made right, for them to attach firmly to the projector, you need to mount it a certain way, but for it to attach firmly to the mount itself, it needs to be mounted just he opposite. Instructions weren't any help either. Stay away and pay a bit more for a much better unit."
2,Unusable,"I've ordered Mustang Projector Mounts in the past and I was overall satisfied. This mount though had a stripped hex screw that I could not get loose. This hex screw went to one of the extension brackets where it is supposed to be lined up with one of the holes in the projector. Because I couldn't get it loosened, I was unable to adjust the brackets to work. I believe this mount was previously used."
2,no longer a fan.,"I own all the previous sets, plus all of Frost, Morse, Last Detective, Waking the Dead, etc. Obviously a brit mystery fan, but sadly, this will be my last ""Midsomer."" This set is dark to the point of weirdness; the Sargeant is bland and boring (bring back Sgt. Troy!); and while Joyce and Calley appear, they are extraneous and muted. Even DCI Barnaby seems tired and quite honestly, not very bright or insightful! The whole pace seems markedly different, and not in a good way. VERY disappointed. If you have been a fan, try borrowing this set - not worth owning. Unlike previous sets, this one will NOT be re-watched by this family of adults."
3,Getting a bit stale,"We've been watching this show on DVD and streaming and liked it a lot at the beginning. However, things are wearing a bit thin by this season. Most of the plots have become so formulaic (three murders, crazy murderer, a fourth murder prevented in the nick of time....) that it's almost a joke. I still enjoy watching Barnaby, but the secondary characters -- Scott, Joyce, and Cully -- add little. Poor Joyce -- she's become a plain jane dullard! Plus, there are so many unlikable people in the stories that it doesn't seem to matter who killed who.There's also the matter of economics. At about $10 per episode (4 episodes per 'set' going for about $40) a show really has to be above average to make it worthwhile. While these were being streamed on Netflix, it was worth it. Now that they've pulled all but seasons 11 and 12, buying the discs is the only option. Frankly, for me, it's not worth it.Goodbye, Barnaby ... it's been fun!"
2,midsomer murders ; set nine,i received the set and the casese the dvd came in are broken and will just not like any of my other orderes! not good
5,Midsomer Murders Set 9,"Midsomer Murders is one of the best British mystery series I've ever watched.It seems amazing to me how often people will lie to the police and they're ever so rude to the Chief Inspector, but he always catches them and their lies in the end.Highly Recommended Series !!!"
1,Buy the cd,For 1 dollar more you get 8 more songs. for 50 cents more actually. Think about that. 50 cents more and you get 8 more songs. Only some kind of mentally challenged racoon would purchase 3 songs for 13 bucks and not purchase 11 for 13.50 bucks.BUY THE CD.This is just a rip-off.
1,su*ky cd {1 good song},"1.head strong 3/4{taken from the trapt album ""Trapt"" the only ""good song""}2.promise {i never heard this song}{no album song or somethin'}3.howlow manI DON'T KNOW?DON'T BUY THIS TRASHY 3 SONG SINGLEBUY THE SELF-TITLED ""TRAPT"" CD"
3,I bought it for 3 songs,"It's pretty good. I specifically bought it for only 3 songs - 'Rumors,' 'I can't wait,' and 'The rain.' The whole CD could've used a lot more bass in the recording. I don't know if that's a manufacturing thing or what. But I'm a ""basshead"" too. I have to have the beats!"
5,HAIR CLIP PIN,"VERY BEAUTIFUL , ALL MY FRIENDS JUST LOVED THE PINK HAIR PIN .BONNIE.................VIRGINIA"
5,7th edition,It was required for the class so I needed it. It came in pretty good condition and its to the point
1,wrong edition of book,"i ordered a math book, based on the name of the book and picture of the cover....that amazon had place on their website, it was supposed to the 7th edition, beggining algebra, instead i was sent the 4th edition-teachers edition from the seller, the amazon site didn't list it being the teachers edition,so becareful of the listing, and if not sure don't order until you contact the seller for sure."
1,Beginning Algebra,I was very careful in selecting a textbook that had CD. The writeup communicated that it included the CD but when we received the item there was no CD included.
5,The best Saturn Ported Game for the Genesis,"Ok Virtua Fighter 2 was a bad decision, or maybe they didn't know how to scale it down for a 16-bit console, not sure which one it is. Point here is, Sonic 3D Blast has some of the best, maybe the best graphics on a 16 bit system. The movies involve a 3D accelerator card and the gameplay graphics surpass even Donkey Kong country on SNES, this game has a 32 maybe even 64 bit look. This also has the best music of any of the Sonic games for the Genesis anyways, which is amazing because the Genesis was known for having a bad sound card, but the quality and overall structures of the songs on this game are awesome! This is a classic game and one of the best from the Sonic series."
3,Small but pretty,"These were smaller than I thought they would be. However, they are quite pretty. I wish the stones were larger, because the sunstone is so unusual. The quality of the workmanship and the stones is excellent, as usual. I'd just like to see these in a larger size."
5,A great book.,Dr.Payne was my teacher at the university of Oklahomaand when I had this course (simulation) with him thebook was not published yet. He used to take copies of his notes for us. The content is very original and isderived from many years of experience in this field.Dr.Payne used PL/I as the programming language whichis not used today but is understandable for any computer science student.
3,review,"poor content, it is only a mean for obtaining loose information regarding improvised and modified firearms."
3,"Not bad, but too many unnatural example sentences.","As far as I'm aware, this is the only book of its type. As such it is a valuable tool for the student trying to improve his/her ability with articles. However, too many of the example sentences used in the book are decidedly unnatural. Also, some of the rules are too dogmatic - English is rather more flexible than the author allows. Finally, the book has a number of misprints and errors. Not enough to seriously undermine the text, but enough to make you wary.To sum up, a reasonable text, which covers most of the ground. Some updated examples and a greater attention to detail would help greatly."
2,Poor editing,"The recipes seem simple enough but as you are reading through them, you realize that the instructions does not mention some of the ingredients listed. Also, the coconut shortbread recipe is missing the quantity of butter required.I also thought the book was a bit overpriced."
5,Works great!,I've been using this router for two months now and have not had any problems with it yet. Installation went smoothly when followed the instructions. So far I haven't had to reset the router like some other routers need to periodically. I hope it continues this way.
5,A Great Router!,"I have two of these. One was provided by Verizon when I got FIOS and the other I bought. They sit in series from the FIOS to my home network. I leave the Verizon unit pretty much alone and I configure mine as I need.These are very easy to set up. I have about 10 things sitting on the network (Printer servers, Desktops, WAPs, Desktops, TiVos). I've set up the router to statically assign the IPs to the devices. I've also opened a few ports to the network for the TiVos and other web servers. It all works perfectly.Has DLink discontinued this product? If so, it's a real shame. It's a great router!"
5,Simplicity,"My Linksys router died after several years of use. I had thought to get another linksys.But instead decided to do some research, after which I settled on the D-Link DI-604.When it arrived, I took it out of the box plugged it in, went to an IP address, answered 4 maybe 5 questions AND THAT WAS IT. Everything works even my VOIP phone.Couldn't be any easier. Totally amazing."
3,Seems ok but Firewall is very confusing to configure,"For the price, this router seems like a good value buy, especially if you don't need wireless (why have wireless if you don't use it?) and with a rebate it's even a better deal.I would recommend it over Linksys however the user interface on Linksys is much easier to use. The interface for configuring the firewall options on this D-Link is very confusing. You can't just turn the firewall on for certain common ports, but rather you have to specify the entire range of IP addresses you want it to effect and it's not very user friendly at all."
2,"Seemingly easy to use, FAILS","I bought the D-link DI-604 just because it was [less]than a comparable Linsys DSL router. I always knew that Linksys is the better network equipment maker.The router was extremely easy to set up. It truely was. I have never set up a router in my life but these things usually come easy for me.The thing about the router that I absolutely hate is where you plug in cables. The cables do not stay put. You constantly have to plug them back in. I have multiple brands of cables and none of them stay in. The router was not even moved. I'm wondering if the router just loses the link to the cable and not lose the cable physically.And another thing, the router constantly disconnects from the DSL modem and does not reconnect to it. I have to restart the router 5 times per day. Sometimes, it has nothing to do with the modem. It seems that the router is incompetent.Not recommended.Steve"
4,Easy Setup but One Costly Mistake,"I got this and the setup was very easy having never networked before. The only catch was it told me to use PPoE bc i had Dsl. The catch is if your dsl is always connected you dont use PPoE you use static IP. Not fixing this caused hours of searching and troubleshooting. Finally i did static Ip and eneter my IP and Gate IP, (dont worry aobut DnS) and now internet is througout my house. This is a great router, the only catch make sure you are sure of PPoE or not before starting."
4,"D-Link DI-604 Cable/DSL Router, 4-Port Switch",The product works good and there are no problems with it yet.
4,"Works great, after tech help to set up","The router works great for our network of 2. But when it first arrived I followed the setup and couldn't get it to work. I had my boyfriend Mr. Network Expert to mess with it just in case I had done something wrong in the setup. He got more frustrated than me. I finally gave in and called their 800 number and after changing a few of the number settings, they got it to connect to the internet. Haven't had a problem with it since."
1,Hunk of junk,"Set up wasn't a problem but the unit lasted less than a month then died. I bought this because I was unhappy with Linksys because their router died in less than a year. Just great,(...) Cheap is the key word here. So buyer beware..."
1,The DI-604 does not work with DSL(Ameritech).,I have Windows XP and Ameritech DSL. The router does not work with this configuration. This fact was admitted by D-Link technical support.
1,Mac compatible... If they say so...,"I bought the DI-604 router (rev. E) to connect my iMac 350 (running OS 9.1) and my iBook (running Jaguar) together into a network for simultaneous Internet access.According to the box, it's Mac-compatible. Despite my best efforts, I could never get the router to connect online properly. First, the manual never specifies that the browser installation also applies to the Mac. Secondly, even after I got everything connected together and finally managed to make the wizard appear in my browser, the installation would jam at the WAN autodetection.Even my father, a former electronician and an advanced Mac user for nearly 15 years, could not get the router to work correctly on my computers.I have no use for a router that pretends to be Mac-compatible when it fact it fits the Mac as well as my left shoe into my right foot.Maybe that router is great on Windows. But if you're a Mac user, skip over this router and opt for a real Mac-friendly brand, like Belkin."
1,defective unit,my 604 arrived without the plastic spacer required to hold the cat 5 cable in the connector. after a few dropped connections i realized the unit was defective.
1,Oh NO!,"I was going to try and sell this on Amazon but then I realized how unreliable this product is. I can't sell it because I can't get mine to even work. I had an issue with my cable company for some time, the cable company came out and fixed the cable that was frayed, after that I still could not hook up this router. Now that I have reliable cable service there is something blocking the router from working. I have opened up all channels and made sure even my firewall was off. No internet with this router. POS."
1,A waste of your money and time,"My D-Link DI-604 stopped working all of a sudden afterabout 5 weeks or operation.D-Link technical support has refused to replace it,and wasting 2 hours of my time on the phone.I have gotten rid of it now.I would not recommend it to anyone.Cheap maybe.."
5,Superb Firewall Control,"Configuring the firewall for certain applications is a breeze with the way this is set up. I just log in, click twice, and start entering in my info, click apply and I am done. The firewall I used to have made me click like 5 times, enter info, click apply, go to a different screen, enter in my info again, and click apply. very tedious.I know this isn't a huge thing, but this is what I remember most about the older firewall I had before this. It used to be a pain to add a user to my firewall, but no it isn't.I also like how small and compact it is in size. The price doesn't break the bank, and that is another thing I admire most about this product."
5,Works for me,"I am an admitted newbie to the networking world. I only recently got cable internet, so a router was a pretty big leap. Having limited technical knowledge, the router was setup in a matter of 20 minutes. I was surfing on 3 computers with no problems at all!"
3,Good product ..D-LINK rebates offers are shams,I bought this router and the DMC-200 to go along with it. They worked right off the bat after installation and re-registering the modem with my cable service. In got these specific items for the $10 and $20 rebates that DLINK had in March 2003. They say they never got my submission which is bunk ... I am very careful about rebates .. I sent my Tax software rebate in at the same time and got the check in 3 weeks. Not with DLINK. Good Product .. bad service and customer satisfaction. Buy from Linksys or Belkin next time!
5,WoW !,"SO easy ! one computer windows 98 & the other windows xp home , I didn't even load the cd , hooked up cables ( one cable is 25 feet long ) , few clicks through the setup wizard and up and running in just a very few minutes , no change in cable modem speed , just as fast . Wish I had bought one of these sooner ."
1,Just Don't!!!!!,terribe terrible terrible service and support. Just don't do it. find a competitor product instead.............
5,OMG this thing is Awesome!!,"This little inexpensive router comes with what they call a Virtual Cable Tester. Basically it can tell you if there is something wrong with the ethernet cables you plug in to it. This is simply amazing that something this low costing has this. The few times I had a bad cable it took me hours to troubleshoot because I thought it had to be something else. But now if I have something wrong I can check to see if it is the cable or not, by just pressing a button. The best part is i didn't even know it had this 'till I brought it home.I am amazed at how well this little box handles everything. I play games, stream video & audio, voice chat, netmeeting, everything. And all of it works on this box. I love it."
3,good product but drops valid high value traffic,"I had connected this router to two of my PC's (WinME and WinXP). It was acting with no problems in the ME PC, but on the XP PC, where I had downloaded using Emule and Imesh, it drops connections due to what the logs of the router call SYN Flood. I didn't see any way of telling it to ignore many connections/sec peaks, so I had to disconnect the XP PC from the router for the time being."
4,WORKS AS ADVERTISED,Router was fairly easy to set up using wizard and works just fine with my two computers.
5,Xbox Live,If you buy this router to use with xbox live make sure that if you have firmware version 3.20 you upgrade to 3.36 because even though it said on the website that 3.20 is xbox live compatible it is not and make sure you upgrade it will save you a lot of money on pills that you might have to take because of all the headaches you will have fixing it
4,"Once It's Up and Running, It's Fine","After I received this item, I followed the instructions in setting it up and was not able to get it working. I spent a HUGE amount of time on the phone with manufacturer tech support before it was up and running. Not a single problem since then but getting it going was a pain."
3,one port broken,"Just bought one from [local store] for [$$] after rebates. The web setup is easy. I hooked it up with a Win98 PC and a WinXP notebook. Both works. The DHCP took a minute to obtain the ip address from the router. So, be patient the first time you hook it up. Port 4 worked for an hour and failed. I think it's the connector problem. I think there is a quality issue."
2,Why no network?,"I had four computers running nicely in with a hub and an ISDN hook-up. I changed to a cheaper and faster ISDN hook-up and bought a modem and a DI-604. Easy to get onto the net from each computer, but impossible to get my network up again. D-Link's support was non-existant on e-mail. After four phone calls managed to talk to incoherent youth who said D-Link did not give support on networks. Finally spoke to seller of DI-604. He talked me through several attempts to get the network running, but failed after trying hard. This is in Sweden. I would avoid this product after two days of headaches, a crashed computer and lost Outlook and Outlook Express. D-Link also wiped out all my installed programs. To pay money for this nightmare is crazy.Peter Travis"
5,Great router. Like the Energizer bunny.,For many years I bought Linksys products but starting about 5 years ago I noticed that each Linksys router had a useful life of about a year and after that it was always the same problem (the router would begin to fail to resolve certain domain names. Usually frequently visit sites. For me it was my bank and sites I paid bills on). This would happen at random intervals and go on for varying amounts of time. Resetting didn't resolve it nor did firmware updates or restoring factory defaults. I got fed up and bought this guy a couple of years ago and its still going strong. Easy to configure and setup. Great performance. Extremely reliable.
1,my rebate taken away,"Although the router is good, I have rated it * because they have declined my ""mail in rebate"". I had purchased and applied within the stipulated dates. Inspite of this dlink have declined, why? I do not know. I am sorry to hear that. Very bad."
5,Great Little Router,I bought an older version of this router (it only looks different than the new ones) and it works great. I am fairly new to home networking and wanted to share my cable internet connection between my two computers.I had this router hooked up and working in less than 10 minutes. That was about 2 months ago and I have not had one problem with it since. It is easy to configure and works great with my cable modem. There appears to be no slowing of the internet as I cannot even tell when my kids are on the other computer.I would highly recommend this router to anyone who is looking for one. The price is reasonable and it works like a dream.
2,TOO OLD?,"I don't like the fact that I was refused technical support, because D-LINK considers this an obsolete product. I set up the product and could not get back on the Internet."
2,The DI-604 is not a mature product.,The advertised functionality of the DI-604 looks great and works -- sometimes. The firmware revision on the two devices I examined was 1.0 and incompatible with my DSL modem (I use Earthlink DSL). You can download and patch to version 2.0 but that still didn't fix the incompatibility between the gateway and my modem. I contacted Dlink technical support 4 times (twice by phone and twice by email) and all of the conversations dealt with the DI-704 configuration tool (completely different from the DI-604 config tool). I also own a DI-704 and a DI-704p and would recommend either of these devices over the 604. Dlink is a good company and they will bring this device up to speed - but its not there yet (7/13/02).
3,worked ok,My son needed this when we both had computers in the house. We no longer do so I gave it away.
2,"D-Link DI-604 Cable/DSL Router, 4-Port Switch","I received the unit and when I plugged it in there was nothing, I was ready to send it back but i thought I would try the Electric Cord from my Old Unit. I then worked."
5,my favorite childhood book,"i have a copy of this book, still, even tho i am over 40 years old. i have such warm affectionate feelings for this book. when i saw it in a discount store, i had to buy it!as a child, i called it My Bunny Book. :)my mom gave me my first bunny book. i read this over and over, practically memorizing it. (*i still remember!*) there are imaginative & vivid sweet stories, poems, an alphabet, lovely & colorful drawings and in general quite a lot to read... when you're a little kid. i was in early grade school and i could read most of it. as time went on, and as my vocabulary grew, i could read and understand more words. (mommy, what's that word mean?) That made me proud of my progress. this book made me happy for years.altho written in the early 50s, the beauty of it hasn't faded for me! highly recommended."
2,Honestly...not very good,"I've read a good number of hockey books, not necessarily many biographies, but this one was a pretty bad read. It basically reads as a long Wikipedia entry detailing his achievements and statistics of each season and playoffs combined with quotes and stories from newspapers. Very little insight into his intensity and personality is revealed.I realize Mr. Messier was not a part of this book, and that made it difficult (if not impossible) to really delve into him beyond statistics, but at the end the book was a pretty bland and dry read."
3,Moohoo or Boohoo?,"There I was, lying in the Italian sun reading about one of the greatest hockey players ever. Hardly a good preset to enjoy such a book but I tried it anyway.The first thing you should know is that Mark Messier himself did not bother with the writing of this book. Messier doens't like to talk about his personal life and preferrably keeps it out of sight. With this, the book loses its personal touch so much other biographies have where the person is involved.Everybody who's a hockey fan knows the player Messier. Those who saw him play remember the leader Messier. Unfortunately, this book doens't show you the person Messier enough. But then again, what are the alternatives..."
3,still waiting for Mess's own story,"This biography is well written, pretty complete (although it was written before Messier retired) and fun to read. But it is unauthorized, as all Messier's biographies until now. So let's hope that some day Mark will tell his own story. That will be even more interesting."
5,Led Zep T-shirt,I bought this t-shirt for my 18-year old nephew for Christmas and he really loved it! His mother also liked it and said she was going to take it for herself! Shirt is in good quality and the graphic design is really clear and bright.
3,"OK, but....","I originally ordered this book direct from the Stefanchik organization via a direct mail piece sent to me. While I found the book very informative and educational in regards to the world of buying and selling paper, it also served as a primer for a follow-up telemarketing call from a Stefanchik representitive selling a rather pricy course on the said subject."
1,Stefanchik was nailed by the Feds for Fraud,Here is a link to the actual FTC report.I would read what the FTC have to say first.http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/08/stefanchik.htm
1,Mootsies Tootsies Mallory Navy,"Poor craftsmanship. Lacing came undone, soles started to spilt. The vendor was very helpful and credited purchase amount to my Amazon account."
4,My fourth pair of Mallory,"Mallory fits my style of overall clothing. I knew the shoe well when I ordered it from you. My local source was out of white and stone. You,too, were out of white."
2,Not good for very flat feet,"As my title states, I have very flat feet. I think I bought these because I wanted a flat black shoe that I could wear with basically anything. It would be great for some people, but my feet turned right in while wearing them. I tried putting orthotics in, but there wasn't room. I ended up giving them away. The leather is indeed very soft--you might like that, but they were too soft for me. No support whatsoever."
4,Variances in color,"I bought this model shoe in black at a store, and it was comfortable right out of the box. So, I ordered it from Zappos in another color not available at the store and although it is for the most part quite comfortable, it is a bit too tight across the top of my foot and I had to push in a bit of cotton to avoid continued painful rubbing. I'm hoping that more use of the shoe will allow the top to stretch on its own."
2,Wasn't what I expected,"The shoe didn't have any insole support, it was very flat no cushion feeling in the insole! Leather was soft, almost too giving. Shoe size for B ran very tight...If you aren't seeking a good support to your shoe and aren't walking alot this may be an okay choice for you."
2,"plenty of mistakes,","This is my fourth year taking the absite, and I stopped reading the book a quarter of the way through it. This book has too many mistakes that will not be picked up by junior level residents who have not read in depth surgical texts. I would recommend ""The Surgical Review: An Integrated Basic and Clinical Science study guide"" 2nd edition"
3,Good format but errors in content,"Bought it a few days ago and I like the distilled content-type format, but I just read the burns chapter and found some errors or misleading info... E.g. Staph is the most common burn infection, and pseudomonas is only more common with topical ABx; silver sulfadiazine (not silver nitrate) is contraindicated in G6PD-deficient pts, and Stevens-Johnson is not a more severe form of TEN (it's the other way around). I'm a new intern and caught 3 mistakes on my first pass through 4 pages, which does not bode well for the accuracy of this book. Pretty disappointed Steve."
4,Everyone else is doing it,This is a good study book for the Absite. It is also a good review for your first day or so on any rotation.
2,shelf wear,book was not brand new - or close to being like new.there were multiple areas of shelf wear and the bind of the book was falling apart in the midsection
5,Excellent study tool,"I used this ABSITE review last year for my in-service and scored very highly. Granted I read the book three times and memorized the whole thing. But the point is, the book is excellent and it's a great review of at least the junior version of the test. But like all tests, you have to study for it and time always makes a difference, which is something we all don't have. But still, with the little time we do have, making it through the book at least once will definitely help to raise anyone's score, though it may not feel like it. The tiny text and bullet format may be difficult to read but a small price to pay for a 99% on the ABSITE."
3,A disappointment among the riches of the Schwarzkopf catalog,"Since this double-CD is long out of print, I suppose there's not much value in criticizing it in detail. EMI has released dozens of lieder and opera recordings with their preeminent star, including great live concerts from Salzburg with Gerald Moore from this period in the mid-Fifties.Compared to Moore and Edwin Fischer, by far her best accompanist, George Reeves is stiff and unimaginative, not to mention that the paino sounds thin and clattery. Schwarzkopf recorded every song here in at least one and often multiple versions that are much better. Unless you want a souvenir of Schwarzkopf live in New York, this set is a miss."
5,Not just for jazz,This ride is excellent for rock!...when it is used as a crash. This ride is known for it's crashing abilities and is far ahead of the competition. If you're looking for a versatile ride that you can ride and crash..this is it!!
4,Karate for Kids,It is a good tape for kids. My daughter(a yellow belt) likes it because it has 3 levels of basic karate. Level 1 she finds easy. Level 2 is a little more challenging. She likes level 3; She says it has more self defense moves than what is offered in her classes.
3,Wasn't as high energy as he would've liked,My nine herald loves karate and got this for Xmas for him. He saw itince and said it was boring. I'm sure it was completing with his other toys so I'm not sure. Looke define to me butit wasn't for me
5,What a Difference,"As For looks. WOW. I have to agree with the first review on this guard, Installation isn't simple. After guard is mounted, gives truck a nice mean front look. Mounted on a 2003 Mazda pick up. Appearance goes with out saying, A 10 streight up."
4,Toledo and Bonfa--a great combination!,"This is fine, refined early bossa nova material, and of course, before thetime Astrud Gilberto was discovered while on tour in the U.S. with herhusband and Stan Getz. This material also comes from the time ofMaria Creuza--and I really enjoy hearing these two Brazilian songstesses,Maria Toledo and Maria Creuza. They're just nice. The attempt hasrecently been made to jazz up and sensationalize the bossa hits of theearly sixties--and it just doesn't fit. The simple, airy feeling of thesenumbers on Braziliana will delight you and trigger the impulse withinyou to go to Rio. However, it's never going to be the same. Stick tothis album and buy a bottle of good wine to savor in the process."
5,Brazilian Holiday,"A wonderful recording.... look at the cover design... lush green with Maria and Luiz... That is the contents of Braziliana, alternating from vocals by Maria with string accompaniment to guitar instrumentals by Luiz, solo or with combo. All the songs were composed or co-written by Luiz (most with Maria). Standouts: Tanto Amor, Samba de Orfeu, Saudade, Improviso. They made beautiful music together. Hats off to Verve Records for re-releasing this gem."
1,terrible documentary. ( its not even worth the one star),"dont bother with this ""documentary"". It pulls the race card and tries to turn her into the victim.however it didnt give both sides of the story (which tecnically they dont have to do)but they make it seem like she went to jail just because she's black(they even have one her white teammates drive that point home for us). they covenintly left out the check fraud scam she was involved in accounted for the 4 of the 6 months she was in jail for. nor did she get any extra time for beating a fellow inmates face in, and also her complaining about how hard jail is pretty redundant...its jail, its not supoused to be easy. well anyways shes still a millionare and there are 29 or so of these documentaries better worth your time. pulling the racecard is such a classless thing to do so im not at all high on this movie."
4,The best of the big 3 on this incident,"Jess Walter delivers a dramatic, thoroughly reported, well written account of the standoff at Ruby Ridge. Compared to the other two major books on this incident, this book plays it the straightest. He points some fingers, but only when deserving.Even if you know the final outcome, this book is written well enough to still build some suspense to keep the reader readiing.Overall, a very good book."
5,The best tongs out there,"We cook a whole lot, and we came across these tongs one day and they are the absolute best. We have at least five sets of them, different sizes. They are the perfect weight, they have a nice fluid movement, and they don't rust. The design is easy to clean (not a lot of small spaces for food to get into) and I would definately recommend these."
5,Just the right size!,"The 9.5"" size is perfect. It fits right between 2 other tongs I have and the metal grabbers are perfect for fiery picking. My other tongs are vinyl coated so the Cuisipro locking tongs fills a niche."
4,Good book,So far in my reading it is a pretty nice book. I am not really into theory but it is working nicely. WOuld recommend anyone going into the Psychology field to give this a look.
3,"The ""disconnected"" book?","Papert makes a strong case for creating a ""learning environment"" in the home and the role of the parents, while also stressing the value of allowing children to explore on the computer (vs the old drill programs). He's good at times in arguing this, yet after 100 or so pages you get the feeling he could have made the case in far fewer words, and his writing comes across as stiff and academic...While I admire his efforts in these areas, readers might instead read one of the Dummies books on Kids and Computers or the PC Dads Guide to Becoming a Computer Smart Parent (Dell, Feb. 99)...both are better written, with more practical tips."
4,Family learning cultures respected,"What I like best about Papert's book is the attitude of respect toward children, parents, and the learning potential of families. He is an advocate for learning in non-traditional ways. The calm tone of the book and its overall good sense when talking about learning, intelligence, ""learning disabilities,"" and the politics of School (his capitalization) are very helpful.To anyone who is worried about computers and children; To anyone who is enthusiastic about children and computers; To anyone who really wanted to understand computers and their potential better; I recommend this book.I teach developmental psychology at Ivy Tech State College; I also homeschool two sons who have never been at a conventional school."
3,"Great content, cheap paper!","I give the content 5 stars but the paper of this 'book' is nothing more than thin magazine paper. The Sears Wishbook cover is thicker than this publication. The illustrations are fantastic as are the descriptions and demonstrations. The art work is similar to all of Stohlman's books, it's very Crumb-esque. Good stuff inside but not liking the wrapping paper thin cover. C'mon Tandy, you can do better than this."
5,A great listen for any Vivaldi fan,"Monica Huggett's interpretation of Vivaldi's classic Four Seasons was especially bright and sharp in this recording. Played by the Raglan Baroque Players on period instruments, this recording gives you a good feeling of what Vivaldi actually intended his music to sound like. In addition, the extra four concertos are an additional bonus that go well with the rest of the CD.The recording quality is very clear, and comes across especially well on the CD. Overall, this is a must-have for any Vivaldi fan, or anyone just starting out into classical music in general."
4,I love Kajol,"Kajol looks so pretty...I miss her in the movies out these days! The songs in this movie are some of my favorites...and if you're looking for a typical Indian movie, you'll surely like this one!"
5,Amazing Album,"This album is just wonderful. It's really amazing, I mean, all the songs are very beautiful. I just never get bored of it, the more and more I listen to it, the more I love it."
4,Very Elegant..,My wife likes the idea that it is basically a bracelet but has the watch band latch to make it easier to put on.
1,Received in damaged condition,Just received an hour ago.The back cover of the watch had fallen out in the box.I thought I can press it against the back of the dial but it kept falling out.Though it looks cute the make is bad .
5,Monkees Rarities!!,"If your a true fan of The Monkees you will love this cd packed with rare goodies,The Missing Links collection is the best!!"
4,Great rarities: the Magnificent AND the Rediculous!,"Some great, some awful, but it's up to personal tastes to decide which is which. MY faves are ""Theme From The Monkees"" (TV version! ); ""Propinquity"" (long a fave of mine from NEVADA FIGHTER, interesting to hear an earlier version with perhaps more sensitivity in the melody & singing); ""She Hangs Out"" (the Jeff Barry version), ""Circle Sky"" (the studio version as it ""should"" have sounded), ""Love To Love"" (Neil Diamond's song NEVER sounded better) ""Zor And Zam"" (the ""spooky"" TV version) and ""How Insensitive"" (Nes covers a classic). But my #1 song on the disc is ""Steam Engine"". This is like The Monkees' version of ""Ticket To Ride"" (with a similar lyrical story) and has long been one of my top favorite Monkees songs. Who'd ever guess it'd take 25 YEARS to see a proper release? (My only question is how Rhino neglected to include the ""LP"" version of ""A Little Bit Me..."" on ANY of their Monkees CDs?)"
5,A Must for every Monkees Fan,"I think I listen to this cd at least once a week. I love it! And, with all the great Mike songs on this I'm in heaven!I'd give it 10 stars if the ratings allowed."
3,Excellent writing.,But for me a little boring. Stowers is one of the best true crime writers but this one did not grab me like his others. I still recommend it for any true crime fan.
2,An underwhelming cartoon,"Don't get me wrong, it's nice of Warner's to make these cartoons available, and I'm glad they didn't waste space on the classic sets with these cartoons. But that doesn't change the fact that these are largely inferior to the Hanna-Barbera theatrical Tom & Jerry cartoons.Even though Chuck Jones was a genius in working with the Road Runner & Wile E. Coyote, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and others, for some reason he is completely out of his element here. The animation is lovely as always, but the timing and pacing are all off, the drawing is too cutesy, and the violence (what there is of it) just doesn't play right as a result.This is a worthwhile set for animation historians and Tom and Jerry completists. For those just wanting to have a good laugh with their families, stick to the original H-B theatricals."
4,The Great Chuck,"Chuck Jones is fondly remembered as the creater of some of the greatest cartoons ever. The cartoons in this set were made ahter Chuck left Warner Brothers and Chuck is frozen in the Tom and Jerry format. These are not great cartoon, but some are very entertaining indeed. I highly recommend this set."
4,Funniest Tom and Jerry Era on DVD-Finally!,"Although it could be argued that the sixties didn't exactly hit a high water mark in terms of animation of classic cartoon characters like Tom and Jerry, Bugs, Mickey Mouse, etc., MGM's decision to entrust the creative direction of T&J; to the legendary Chuck Jones was inspired. When ""classic"" T&J; shorts from the 40's play on TV, I find them to be visually impressive but not terribly funny.Chuck Jones, operating with limited technical budgets in the 60's, understood the limitations of his animation and put more of an emphasis on characterizations and movement of his characters--to great comedic effect. Note the small things--from Tom's frequent double takes, to ""breaking the 3rd wall"" and staring directly at the camera--to the way he will kind of stutter step when rounding a curve at high speeds. Just little bits of comedy business that work beautifully. Glad to see these shorts now available on DVD. I will buy!"
2,This is not the Tom and Jerry i enjoy sorry.,Sorry to say but Tom and Jerry by the original creators Hanna and Barbera from 1939 to the early 50's are the best ones. When Chuck took over it is just not the same.
5,A Masterwork,"Olson's ""Maximus"" is not for everyone. However, for those brave souls who read poetry, it will prove to be an unforgettable experience. ""Maximus"" is one of the most expansive American long poems. In its scope, it rivals both ""The Cantos"" and ""A"". For those used to the polished verse inhereted from Europe, the journey through ""Maximus"" will be disorienting at first. But for those readers that are willing to take the leap, ""Maximus"" will prove to be a rewarding experience that will open new ways of reading and thinking. I suggest you buy it today and spend a few years traveling with Olson and Maximus of Tyre."
2,"Please, Mr. Olson, There Are Ladies Present","Now, don't get me wrong: I'm sure ""Charles Olson...was good at a great many things; writing poetry happened never to be one of them. This book, which includes the better part of his life's work, is just plain silly; the text is written in strange spirals and turns, & it's nearly impossible to figure out what he's talking about half the time. It's reminiscent in some places of the work of Robert Pinsky, but without Pinsky's characteristic cleverness, wordplay, and lyricism. It resembles, in other places, the maritime verse of Samuel Sewell, but it remains far more elusive than Sewell would ever have allowed. And, while it brushes at times towards an almost Tolstoyan eroticism, it drops swiftly into the scatalogical -- rather tastelessly, one might add. I certainly don't recommend it for the squeamish, or anyone of delicate sensibilities."
2,ouch!,"If you're looking for a way to catch up in your world history class this is a great book, but if you want to do well on the SAT II this will do close to nothing for you. The book uses too many facts rather than general patterns as the SAT II does, and if you go by their tests in the back of the book, well lets just say you'll get a nasty surprise when you take the SAT II. They are NOTHING alike! Trust me, I learned the hard way. All in all, I STRONGLY suggest looking elsewhere."
1,Thoroughly strange,"It features some great teachers/speakers, frequently interrupted by a handpuppet that's supposed to be an Indian guru. The puppet cracks wise (sometimes) and weird (more often than not). It distracts from the message to the point that by the end of the movie, I no longer knew what the message was supposed to be. Save your money and buy The Compass, Beyond the Secret, and/or Beyond Belief. Each of them taught me something valuable. This one left me confused and extremely disappointed."
1,BAD,It is too commercial very. The quality of a musical piece is remarkably low and the pronunciation of English words is also very bad.
2,Looks Like Rain,"You can always judge a society by its pop idols. While Ayumi Hamasaki enshrines the paradigm of semi-tragic, pristine, poker-faced cyber doll, Utada Hikaru offers a healthier, more red-cheeked alternative, more like girl-next-door meets CG nature goddess.Oh, yeh, and she ALWAYS looks like she's going to cry!!! Japanese boys probably like that."
3,Pure individualism,"Ms. Utada is a true individual. Deep River is a great mix of rock, r&b, and pop! She has truely out done herself. So I definately would recomend it to anyone who's curious, of mixxed worlds of music."
3,"More of the same, but can't complain...","Utada Hikaru has put out another album of pop that you can't help but like. I particularly like the last track, ""Hikari"". You can see that she is trying to branch out more into different kinds of music, but she sounds best when she sticks to her forte: straight-up pop that connects emotionally precisely because there is a real girl-next-door quality to the lyrics and the delivery. The production is nice and clean, with some creative programming thrown in. Apparently she writes her own stuff, but I'm not sure how much credit she deserves for the actual music. She has a real team of professionals backing her up. All in all, good stuff. I'm sorry that you folks importing it have to pay so much, but you should know that even in Japan it costs almost $30 (thank the Japanese recoed industry...)"
3,Good but not amazing,"DEEP RIVER, while not being my favorite Utada record, is still a solid listen. Imo, it captures the time in utada's journey between the pretty but average Distance, and the unusual art pop of Exodus. Sakura & Travelling are beautiful tracks that really showcase utada's strong sense of rhythm & melody. Tokyo Nights is another point of interest with it's odd amalgam of harpsichord & urban beats. It's not a perfect record by any means, but it's certainly a worthy addition to any utada fans album catalog."
3,Takes some time to grow on you...,"When I first the cd I was really disappointed. I had heard all the singles and they were good. But overall the album sounded very dark and melancholic. But after hearing it for some more time, now I think that all the songs are great but all of them stand out individually rather than together with each other. But if you like r&b this is a good buy since Utada's voice is good."
3,Not their best,"Being a huge fan of Toenut's album ""Information"" I decided to give this one a try. It's interesting to say the least, and more of what Information was about. But yet didn't reel me in quite like the previous effort. Still, if you are a fan of Information, it's worth giving a listen :-)"
5,I was wrong,"I thought filters were there to protect the lens from damage...but once you use the cheaper ones on a good lens, you will notice the degradation of the filter on your images, whether it be colors saturation, ghosting, or lens flare, it was hurting! B+W makes a fine filter that prevents scratches and marks on your lens without hindering its image quality. No more ghosting in my pictures if a light source is within the frame. I would say spend the money if you have an expensive lens that you want to protect as well as preserve your photo quality. Otherwise, stay with the cheap stuff for standard protection."
3,Paper bookmarks,These bookmarks aren't super sturdy but they get the job done of holding your place. My kids are always using the funniest objects to hold their spots in books so this works for them. Plus there are several in this booklet if they lose any.
2,Not Great,Not a great collection - all of the older familiar tunes are live perfomances and not worthy of DVDA.
5,an emotional rollercoaster,"I will just say this as clearly as possible. Listening to this cd is an emotionally exausting experince. Much like watching a finely crafted film, this cd travels through calm, insanity, the erradict, the haunting, and saddness. Listening to this cd: I squirmed at the screetching maddness and pain, I cringed and shifted in fear, I cried at the desperation, and finally got to the point where I was laying there on my bed weeping, because it was all I had left to give. This cd demands you as a listener to emerse yourself in vena cava as an emotional participant. If you've never experienced something like this, it might even change your life, or at least your day."
1,Horrible!,"These eye make up remover pads are just horrible. Andrea EyeQ's are thin pads which are completely soaked in oil, to the point where they're difficult to get out of the container one by one. After using these pads to get your make up off, you'll have to use another product to get the oil off your eyes. Frankly, you may as well save your money and by a bottle of cooking oil and plain cotton pads and use that instead, because that's what you'll get when buying these remover pads..."
4,"A Sample, or a Taste Test","This is a sampler of music from the earlier recordings of the ensemble Fretwork, the most highly acclaimed viola da gamba consort of our times. It includes polyphonic fantasies for gamba quartet and quintet, as well as selections from the curious repertoire of music for voices and gambas, such as the fairly well-known ""Cries of London"", which blend street sounds and ballad elements with elegant gamba counterpoint. If you're unacquanted with any of the late English Renaissance music for viola da gamba, this would be a good starter CD. Otherwise, I'd suggest going straight to a search through the recordings of Tye, Locke, Lawes, Holborne, etc. by two ensembles: FRETWORK and PHANTASM"
4,The Cryes of London oversight,"The edition of this CD is surely an abridged one, because I used to have the original edition which included ""The Crye of London"", Parts 1 AND 2. This edition only has part 2, which is a real shame, because the part 1 is just wonderful, although badly miked. The voices sound so much like real street characters (my favorite - ""Periwinkles, quick, quick quick!""). Makes you think of ""Who Will Buy"" from the London cast of ""Oliver"". The rest of the CD is quite sublime, from the melancholy ""Singing Swans"" to the fantasias and madrigals.The perfect record to listen to while reading ""Man's Illegal Life"" by Keith Heller, which I've reviewed in Amazon books."
1,Head leaks,"This pump worked ok on my friends Shrader valve, but forget pumping up a presta valve tube. The pump head is junk."
1,Stuck like glue to Presta valve,"I could not get the pump head off of the Presta valve on my bicycle tire. In the end, I rotated tire with valve on top to get enough leverage using both hands to yank it off. I was lucky the valve stem did not tear off. This cannot be good for the tire. I will not attach this pump to my bicycle again. Either this pump is defective or this pump is poorly designed. I am returning the pump. Other than this defect, this seems to be a high quality pump. Disappointing."
4,Nice Pumps!!!,The pump works for me very well but I can't really compare it to anything else so it's hard for me to say if it's any better than others on the market.
2,"TOO! hard to realese, get ready to buy extra tubes","THE BADNot a good product for the money. It doesn't matter how gentle i've trying to realesed from valve I end up ripping the stem off tube. After four tubes is now braking in. I add a bit of butter on rubber part so is a bit easy to realese.It doesnt register the initial tire psi.My friend has an Specialized pump a little more expensive but is very easy on the bike stem valve.THE GOOD: It delivers air fast, it feel very solid when pumping.CONCLUTION: If it wasnt that is hard to snap it off the valve this punp is ok. It feels that it get easy as I use more (may be get a dummy tire stem valve to help initial brake in). Next time I'll go to my local bike store and test them."
1,Head cracked after using it for less than 50 times,"When it was working the pump was great - accurate, fast, easy to use. However after less than 50 uses the plastic head cracked and doesn't hold the thumb switch anymore (the wholes for the pin that keeps the thump switched cracked open). It seems to be a combination of cheap material and bad design."
5,Blackburn sent valve replacement for free,Had this pump for years. Blackburn sent parts replacement when I asked. Pump was stolen. So I am buying another.
1,No good at all.,"I had high hopes for this pump, and even when it began (within the first day or two) to show signs that, like so many other pumps, it was going to be temperamental, I persisted in believing it wouldn't ultimately let me down. It did, though. Three weeks in and it has failed completely. I feel lucky it failed *after* a ride and when I was within reach of another, working pump, or I would have been in pretty bad trouble.That's it for Blackburn as far as I'm concerned."
4,Great pump,"It pays to be quality and this pump is very, very nice.Everytime I use it I SMILE knowing the deal I got on this truly sweet bike pump. Compared to a pump you buy in a department store this is a Rolls Royce."
5,OUTSTANDING BOOK ON A REAL LIFE PSYCHIC,"I ordered this book online as it's not on Kindle. The reason I had to get it is because he was in the house that was haunted inTrue Hauntingwhich is my favorite and scariest true story ever! Joe DeLouise knew at a very early age he had special psychic powers. He also can sense and see spiris and ghosts. Another psychic told him he at the age of 40 his mission would begin. He predicted many events in the future and was in great demand because of his accurate and detailed predictions.I was elated when the book showed up on my doorstep as I read it in two days. It is autograped by Joseph Delouise ""To Mary Best Wishes To A Bright Future"".I highly recommend this book but it takes some effort to get because it's >40 years ago and not currently on Kindle. It's worth the effort and a great companion book to go along with True Haunting which is outstanding! Both books highly recommended and highly collectible especially when autographed!"
1,Bad.,"I bought this so that my wires would not tangle on the run, but the cord is too short and I'm only 5'4"" . When I have my mp3 player in my pocket, it would not be able to reach my ears. The covers on the earbuds are scratchy and the sound is horrible. Don't waste your money on this."
1,Too short. Useless clip,"It's made for short people. For ~6 footers, especailly if your device is in your pants pocket, the too short wire is always tugging at the ear buds. Also, since the clip is below the retractor, the weight of the retractor is on the earbuds and is not relieved by the clip, thus making it useless."
1,disappointed,"I would like to request a refund for this item. I returned the first pair I received because it would not retract after less than a week of use. And now, just yesterday, both sides have quit working. Could I please receive a refund or a credit?Thank youJulie Elwell"
2,Scosche Iuhp4 Retract Earbuds,"Retractable earbuds sounds like a good idea. The buds are too big for my ears. Spend a little extra buy Skull earbuds, for a secure and perfect fit."
4,good earbud headphones,"I really like the retractable feature of these earbuds. I am always getting the cord caught on knobs, etc when I use outer earbuds on my iPod while moving around the house. The only problem I have had is that the earbuds are a little large for my ears so it is hard to get them to stay securely in my ears at times."
1,broke the same day I received them,"The retraction device broke almost instantly. Though, I do have to say the sound quality is good.Can't wait to return it."
3,Worth the money (but I wished for more),"I was pleasantly surprised at how comfortable and well these earbuds performed, given that I paid less than $10 for them. However, it's been less than a month and the left one (the one I use most) is going staticky on me. I'm disappointed. I wasn't enamored enough to consider buying a replacement set...I had hopes of getting at least two or three months out of them (why are earbuds disposable?).They're worth the price, and probably more. Too bad for me, I had higher hopes for wear and tear."
2,so far so good,These earbuds were specifically purchased because of the retractable feature. I needed more detailed instructions on how the retractable cord works and proper setup. With help I did get that done and they are working well and the retractable feature is working as hoped.
3,would not buy again,"I usually don't write reviews, but this product had a couple of shortcomings I thought should be mentioned. The sound quality is decent, however the following are dealbreakers for me....1) The cord is not long enough- when fully extended, it is only about 31"", not enough for me to have an ipod in a deep pants pocket (and I am under 6' tall)2) the retraction on my pair stops 1/2 way and I must help the cord spin back in."
2,Okay for Music Player Use - NOT for Exercise Machine Use,"The earphone cord is short and thus when you plug into the port on Exercise machines (Elliptical trainers,etc.), to listen and watch tv, you may have a problem if you are over 5' 8"". You will have to stoop or adjust your position on the machine. The sound is good for music player use"
2,doesn't seem as potent,"I've been bleaching and dying my hair all sorts of colors for like 15 years now . . . Manic Panic was always a pretty solid brand, and I've stood by it for I think too long now. For the last year or two I have been trying not to lose faith in the brand, but . . . it just doesn't seem to be the same formula or something. I've tried the ""amplified"" version with slightly better results, but miss the days when dumping the money for ""the good stuff"" yielded better results than some off walmart brand. Sadly, I think it's time for this old bat to switch. :'( sorry manic panic"
3,On bleached hair...,"Length:: 0:07 MinsIt's a really funky color, and not at all what I expected lol. The first application, I left it on for an hour, and it did not take evenly. I used the last half of the jar and let it soak in for a few hours and it looks better now. I am not really impressed. I've used other brands of temporary dyes in the past, and have only had to leave them in for about 20 minutes to get bright even results. Before I used Purple Haze, I used the Manic Panic Amplified Flash Lightning Bleach Kit, and it was awesome!"
2,Very Disappointed,"I have naturally black hair so I decided to do a strand test. I bleached first and the overall turnout was very dull and lusterless. Maybe I didn't leave the bleach or dye on long enough. I did use a hair dryer on the dye portion of it. It also damaged my hair horribly. I will use it more and try the bleach longer, but I was not impressed at all with this product. BE WARNED!!!"
3,"Nice color, doesn't last long","Like others have said, this is more like a coating than a dye. I left it in for a l-o-n-g time, and tried setting it variously with salt and vinegar solutions. It still washed out within a week. Since my intent was to shock and appall my children by showing up with blobs of purple hair on my Oldth birthday, and not to make a permanent fashion statement, this was OK. 'Course, the kids said, ""Hi, Mom. Oh, Purple hair. Now where did I put the diaper bag?"" So apparently I've done enough outrageous things to get away with the ridiculous."
2,It works in theory,"Alright I did everything it asked and then some, I waited 2 hours to wash out the dye, and well, it didn't work out to well as expected, after your hair dries the dye is still gonna stick on everything.Keep in mind that I bought Rockabilly blue, it just made my head semi blue and mostly black, never mind that this stuff gets all over me! I woke up the next day and my face was blue! Alright not totally blue but a tint of blue. To sum it up, this thing sucks. I think they paid the other people to write good reviews for this thing.Don't waste your money."
3,"Ginger's great, film so-so","I got this film based on the fact Ginger Rogers plays in it, However, it's not even close to a favorite film. However since all people have different taste you may love it. Rent it first before buying"
3,So-so,"I'd read several times about Ginger Rogers' attempt to extricate herself from just being Fred Astaire's dancing partner and becoming a serious actor instead. In that vein, I bought this movie. But while it's okay, it's nothing to write home about. It is, however, several cuts above the inane plots in the Astaire/Rogers dancing movies."
2,waste of time,"this was a big disappointment, maybe because i've read so many books like this. way too much visual junk and very little to read. i also didn't learn anything new."
1,lie,well when one look at vhs tapes and see this pitchure will one think that we are buying a vhs tape. THAT A LIE ! It was a papper back book.
2,Not impressed,I thought this would be an awesome book to use. It does have some useful information. But the book is so disorganized it takes quite a while to find an answer to your question. And it did not answer all of my questions unfortunately. I get more help just going on the general Internet.
5,The Best Service,Thank you so much for prompt delivery and the book was in excellent condition. It is helping me to discover natural remedies for killing the bugs that are eating my annuals.
5,Giant book of Garden Solutions,I may never have to use another synthetic fertilizer or insecticide. Easy solutions that really work.
2,"Good recipes, but........","This book seemed to offer a few good recipes for homemade solutions as far as insecticides, herbicides, etc., but.....This has got to be the absolute most disorganized book I have ever read.My advice is, look for something else more organized. You'll be so glad you did. Especially when you have a problem and need an immediate answer on what to do."
1,Master Quack!,"Has anyone actually went beyond reading this book and actually put the remedies to use in their own gardens? Jerry Baker is a gardening quack. His so-called remedies have been disproved by university horticulturists time and time again. I am a real, certified master gardener, and I can tell you that some of his recipes can actually hurt your plants, your soil and your body."
1,Its Not What You're Looking For,"If you watched the movie and remember a few great songs, this is not where you will find them. ""California Dreaming"" by The Mamas and the Papas? Nope, not here. ""Things In Life"" by Dennis Brown (the jukebox song from the bar)? Nope, not here. ""What a Difference a Day Makes"" by Dinah Washington? You guessed it, not here. But the big kicker that you're going to love the most- that beautiful mezmerizing strings symphony from the opening scenes is here, well sort of- OK, not at all. Actually Fornication in Space is not the song we're talking about- in fact this song was never in the movie at all! Its a cheezy synthesizer *cover* of the symphonic strings piece. You're actually looking for Michael Galasso's ""Baroque"", and yep, you guessed it, its not here. What a farse. When you consider this Hong Kong import ""soundtrack"" if you actually want to call it that- consider other HK imports like bronze Rolex watches and you'll get the idea..."
5,great fun,This was a great gift for my daughter when she started potty training. Her babies are all able to use the potty too!
5,SHIPWRECK HISTORY,This series is a fine visual presentation detailing the history of ships that have influenced our modern world. It begins with a lively introduction by Mr. Cussler himself that shows his obvious enthusiasm for the subject matter at hand. Join James Delgado and his team of divers as they explore these wrecks and carry the viewer back in time for a remarkable underwater tour. I have been a wreck diver all of my life and found this to be well photographed and narrated. I recommend this DVD set to anyone who has an imagination and a sense of adventure. It has been a fine addition to my video library and will be to yours too.The Wreck Hunters: Dive to the Wreck of the USS Bass
4,Clive Cusslers Sea Hunters Set 1,Lavishly and lovingly produced sure to thrill any fan of treasure hunting and exploring wrecks on the bottom of the ocean. Highly recommended.
3,Not exactly what I expected,"I was a bit disappointed in the towel. I thought it would have been a bit thicker, more plush. My son (who was the recipient of this gift) was happy with it though--bright colors and large."
2,thin towel,We love the towel because of its Redskin design but it is thin - lighter weight than we expected - not a nice plush beach towel.
1,HP refused to support BT450,The printer and adapter settings to make the device work are complex and HP refused to support software installation and device settings for their product. I would recommend a different brand.
1,FAKERY,"I've just received this item and IT IS A FAKE. I don't know where have you purchased it but it's not the real one.1) cover is obviously made with a color printer. A very bad printer however.2)band name is wrongly written. Correct name is Companyia ElècTRICa Dharma and it's titled as Companyia ElècTRCIa Dharma.3)tracklist is also wrongly written:-track 1 appears as ""Ovirgo"" while the correct title is ""O Virgo"".-track 2 appears as ""Strella splendens"" while the correct is ""Stella..."" .- A little clue to discover the faker: ""strella"" instead of ""stella"" is properly made by a Spanish speaker.-track 4 appears as ""Los 7 Got X"" while correct is ""Los 7 Gotx""Faker had a bad day![...]Avoid this item!!"
5,Amazing addition for info to catalog my collection,Bought this book to use as a reference for cataloging and it even though older book. Love it! A must for thimble collectors.
1,DVD never played,Received this DVD and it never worked. Would not play in any DVD player that we tried. Waste of money.
4,not really for babies,"This is more for parents to learn and not so much for babies to watch. That said, it was pretty good!"
1,DVD is not compatible with Xbox360,"The DVD would not play, I am not sure why because my pc could recognize it. Xbox will play everything else. This one was a no go. From the looks of the brief piece I watched the video seemed really really dated. My guess looked like the eighties."
3,Picture is not of actual toy-Beware!,"I bought this toy because of the picture-it shows a currently retired Gund Magnatude Monkey. I wanted this specific one because the current one I have is getting old and worn-and I needed a second one. BEWARE!! I received the package and out came a dark brown monkey with a very different face-this is the current Gund Magnatude Monkey. (And not what I wanted) The box was well packaged and shipped quickly-but this was NOT the monkey pictured!! :( I contacted the company that shipped it and they stated they just use a ""stock photo"" of the product for their Amazon acct. and said they were sorry and would send me an RA through email. I never received the RA-and decided to just donate the monkey to charity since I have no use for it. I didn't fight it but I think I should have more since they still have the wrong photo up, and it been over 6 months since I bought it."
1,Disappointing Software,This product was a complete waste of money as the software provided did not do as promised! I have not been able to download the pictures from my cell phone as advertised this item would do.
5,Best thong on the planet,I have been wearing this thong for ages and it's the most comfortable I have ever wear.
5,Favorite Underwear,"These are so comfortable. You literally feel like you're not wearing anything. It's for those days when you want to go commando but don't want to feel quite as vulnerable. I love, love, love these g-strings. They are the best g-strings on the planet."
3,Good to have all the music-dreadful sound,"I have always enjoyed this musical, though it probably would have been much better (and more coherent) with all the music on this soundtrack. The biggest loss is ""My Intuition"" that really explains the Garland/Hodiak characters. The Harvey Girls is really the first time Hollywood created a Broadway musical on the screen--not just another backstager-but, like Oklahoma! with character songs that moved the plot along (like ""It's a great big world""). Unfortunately, the sound quality of what's left after almost 70 years is difficult to take. Very dry, low volume, mostly muffled, and they shouldn't have bothered with the stereo mix which is mostly wishful thinking. Rhino did a good job with what's left, and it's all good hear. It's a shame Arthur Freed insisted that his movies be 2 hours or less. With all this music it would have been great."
5,One of the best of 2000,"Duke Robillard produced this CD, and fans of Duke or anyone else who loves upbeat, ultra-hot blue music should love this a lot. Duke plays on it, and so do some hot guests like Micheal Hill, Tony Coleman and Sax Gordon. Honestly, there isn't a bad moment on this CD and Robert Charles is a GREAT blues singer."
5,"Yeah, Baby!","Nothing much more to add that others haven't said here: If you like good -- no, great -- blues, check out this CD. Robert Charels gets it done, and I'm proud to say I know the man from back in the day. The man's got pipes and chops and soul ... what more could you ask? Okay, how about Duke Robillard producing? Look, you don't need a sell job: There's a fistful of five-star comments here. Do yourself a favor and drop the coupla bucks -- you won't be sorry. What else ya gonna do instead, click on over to the Celine Dion pages?"
4,Nasser's Shirt,"THe work of a great man, this book is vital to anyone studying Egypt, Arab culture or anyone wanting to understand the current happenings in the Arab world. I highly recommend it."
3,Love Ellen Barrett,I love Ellen Barrett workout videos. She's so enthusiastic without being annoying. This workout is effective but very repetitive. Some people might have a problem with that.
5,Kick Butt,"I have several of Ellen Barrett's videos and this is one of the better ones. I worked out yesterday and I still felt it in my legs long after the workout was over. I really like the music on this one, too."
4,Good workout,"I like the workout. The flow is good and the routine is fresh. However, even though this is probably silly, but I must say it turned me off a bit when the arms of one of participants seemed flabby when she waved in the beginning and the other one have a slight muffin tops around her waist (could just be the pants is too tight because she is not fat)."
4,Great Motivator,Received this as a present and I love it! It's motivated me to get my arms in shape. It's very easy to follow and the instructor and background music is very pleasant. I feel rewarded doing as little as 5 minutes when I'm busy and as much as 45 minutes when time allows. I recommend beginners start with 2pound weights then work their way up.
3,Just what I needed...,"Strong arms(gym-style toning), cardio, fluid(dance inspired) moves and big range of motion. That's what you'll get here! What a surprise this workout was, Ellen is a breath of fresh air. This workout is indeed intermediate, as it got my heart rate up and I was sweating bullets! lol I've been working out with Leslie Sansone for months and lost 20 lbs. So, I needed a workout to tone/sculpt and this one fit the bill. Ellen works the heck out of your arms! During the workout I felt the burn, but no 'day after' soreness. I walked away feeling good, strong and encouraged to do it again. Great job, Ellen!"
3,Skinny Sculpt with Ellen Barrett,The workout is fabulous! All her workouts are. However the quality of the dvd is not very good. I sent one back and the next one was the same if not worse. I think it's just the way it was filmed since 2 of them are this way.
4,"Relaxing, strenghtening and total body","This is a workout I will use once or twice a week on days when I still want a good workout, but not so intense that I sweat a lot. This works the upper and lower body, as well as the abdominal area. I used 3-5 lbs and form is important for best results on this one. Ellen is pleasant to have as an instructor. This DVD feels like you are in a Pilates class and seems personal. I gave it four stars as it is easier than I expected."
1,Defective Disc,"I saw a few reviews here warning of the cheapness of the disc but went through with the purchase. Alas, I lost that bet. The video is all messed up and is unusable from the start. Cool thing is that Amazon is refunding me without my having to send it back (for some reason). I'm not going to buy it again, however. I like Ellen but I'm too annoyed with crappy quality DVDs, especially at the price."
5,Quite the challenging workout!,"I found this workout to be quite challenging. While there is alot of emphasis on working the arms & shoulders, there is also plenty targeting other areas throughout. The chair sequence for example, is a little different than on any of her other videos and I know I am trembling by the end of that segment. I have been doing a rotation of Ellen's videos every week for a year with this being my most recent one, so I am definitely no beginner, and I had to pause a few times throughout the first few times I did it. I thought my arms were going to fall off. The mat workout at the end is great too, with different moves she hadn't done before. I am definitely feeling my inner thighs after Skinny Sculpt. This video has worked WONDERS for my tricep definition. Definitely one of my favorite Ellen videos!"
4,Solid video,"I love Ellen Barret's philosophy when it comes to exercise. You should feel energized after your workout, and not like you're going to pass out, which is how I usually feel. I exercise at least 6 days per week in constant pursuit of the ""burn"" Ellen's workout are easy on the body yet challenging and effective. I highly recommend."
2,A TRUE WORK OF ART...,"JUST KIDDING!...In this Italian-made film from 1964, German-born actor Horst Buchholz plays Dino, a non-talented artist who's in love with Cecilia, a beautiful model played by Catherine Spaak. Dino introduces Cecilia to his blonde, Suthin'-accented American mother (Bette Davis, in a wig) and tries to impress her with his wealth. When Catherine leaves Dino for another man, Mama soothes her boy and encourages him to resume his artwork. A bad, pompous film which is only redeemed by watching the campy playing of Davis. I find it really ironic that you can purchase this ludicrous ""Bette Davis movie"" on video, yet certain FINE films such as OLD ACQUAINTANCE, IT'S LOVE I'M AFTER, FOG OVER FRISCO & ELIZABETH THE QUEEN are currently unavailable."
2,Too Easy,"I am an avid Tae Bo fan and was looking for something just to break up my routine and after seeing the reviews for this dvd I can't believe I spent my money on it.Through the entire warm up I felt like I was doing ballet. It was wayyyyy too easy and boring and whereas yes I would recommend it to someone who is a beginner,I honestly hated it. My two year old could do this in her sleep."
3,Kickmax,This workout is excellent but difficult. Definitely not for beginners. The segment aspect kept it interesting and manageable. I do it twice a week but alternate it with less extreme workouts. All in all a good dvd.
4,good workout,I was looking for a more advanced workout with both cardio and sculpting. The kickbox/bootcamp challenge is my favorite part for a great cardio workout. The leg conditioning drills are also a great leg workout.
3,Mediocre workout,"If you want a fun, intense, interesting workout this isn't for you. The choreography was definitely lacking. After doing it twice I felt like I had done the workout a hundred times. The kickbox sequence hardly got my heartrate up and the 'blast' was too much jumping, which was hard on the joints (and, I'm only 23), boring and repetitive.However, this is the only workout I've tried of hers, so I gave it an average grade of three stars in hopes that her other workouts might be better.(And, the price! Ouch!)If you want a good workout try Karen Voight's (not the yoga or pilates, boring!). I just did Burn & Firm the other day. It's a great, fun, whole body workout."
3,Kick Max really gets you in shape,"This DVD is really effective, great cardio core workout, intense which I really like."
2,So disappointing!,"I normally love Cathe's videos, but this one was horrible. The kick/punch segment was so basic that my 3 year old could do it. Not even hand weights made this challenging. And you don't breathe heavily until the boring jumping section after the kick/punches. I am sad I can't return it."
3,"few real good songs! a few pretty good songs, a few ok songs","welcome to the 21st century, everybody loves u, alien@ation and alien christ are really good. the rest are ok/not so good. they're style has changed to fit the newer style of electronic music. slower beats, lyrics that flow into each other (not like flaunt it with random words that happen to rhyme), it's a matured sound but under-produced. if you're a sputfan get it, you'll like enough of it."
2,sad,"because i live overseas in an area with few latinos, i was really looking forward to the release of this dvd. i had seen him on tv on holiday in north america and expected good clean laughs. i was disappointed and offended by the language. it would have been just as funny without the swear words. the famous ""chancletazos"" are funny because we have all seen them - no profanity needed.couldn't finish watching the whole dvd. i'll stick to watching him on tv so the language doesn't offend."
5,If you wanna laugh your buns off....,"Then this is the DVD you have to buy. I was on the floor rolling with laughter. Especially because I can relate to a lot of the things he says.Listening to Lopez is when you realize that it really doesn't matter where you're from, deep down we are basically all the same and what the same things in life. You will laugh heartedly."
5,LOVE YOU George!!,George is the best spanish comedian hands down!! Love his stuff & his tv program.. Would like to catch him live now at one of the local casinos.
5,Why you crying?,I highly recommend this!!! He's very funny and you will not stop laughing from the moment you start till it ends.
4,Love George Lopez!,"I saw this dvd on Comedy Central one night, and I just had to get it. The jokes and stories about his family are endearing. If you like his comedy, you'll love this one."
4,For Latins,You really have to have a latin backround to appreciate this DVD. If you have it you'll roll on the floor with laughter!
3,Some of it's funny .,"I watched this on dvd the other night ,some of the things he said were cute, some things were hysterical ,but not all of it was funny ,in fact alot of it wasent funny at all , most of the time i just sat there and didnt laugh ,in the beginning it seemed funny and i laughed but not all through it, it was okay , some of it i think was rude and crude and stupid and made fun of things that was nothing to laugh at like imitating someone having a heart attack that wasent funny , a heart attack is very serious , so i only give it three stars ."
5,great service,love the quick and effecient service.great low price and product was in great condition as promised.
1,This is not the life of a cops wife,"I have been married to a law enforcement officer for 10 years. This book is everything to do with a woman who is self absorbed, and nothing to do with being married to a cop. It should have been titled ""I have nothing else to do with my life, so hey, why not write a stupid book"". If anyone wants to know what it is like being married to the badge, you are better off staying far away from this book and talking to some real LEO wives. My disappointment in this book is extreme. I am actually angry at the writer for using that title. It is not at all about being married to a Cop."
1,The most horrible book,"This book was awful. It had nothing at all to do with being married to the badge. Plus her grammar is horrible. There is no point to this book, unless you just like to read a bad book for the heck of it."
1,Unbelievable,This was no where near the true life of being married to an officer! It is a disgrace to police wives and their husbands.
2,More of a novel than helpful....,"It wasn't a bad novel, but I would not recommend it as a book to help police families because it just doesn't. It is an ok story with some very harsh language that I was suprised about and quite a few typing errors (bad editor). As the wife of a police officer, I was expecting more of an inside look into another LEO family, instead I got a bedtime story. If you are looking for support or insight, look somewhere else."
1,Disappointing,I would NOT recommend this book for families of law enforcement officers. It does not portray the typical lifestyle of a law enforcement officer. The author (in my opinion) wrote this book based solely on her experiences. There are typos through out the book. It also has VERY explicit language and intimate details in it. I was highly disappointed in the book.
4,Another great mixtape by D-Block,"Really great tracks by Sheek Louch: Respect, Love You, and Excuse Me Buddy. Give It Up and Set Up are some great, hard tracks by Styples P, showing his skills in storytelling. Even though J-Hood is no longer with D-Block I still enjoy his song Game Is Dirty on this mixtape.I don't think the person who rated this 1 star even listened to the CD, this is a great release by D-Block. The only problems with this mixtape is there are no songs by or featuring Jadakiss and I heard 3 of these songs on previous mixtapes, which is why it gets 4 instead of 5 stars."
5,Review of SIDEMAN by Dr. Paul Tanner,"A very entertaining book from one of the four sidemen with The Glenn Miller Band that played every engagement the civilian band had from mid 1938 through its break-up in the fall of 1942. Dr. Tanner tells what it was really like to have played in the most famous big band of that time. The section on what happened to Glenn Miller is very interesting and the many interviews with Dr. Tanner reveal some interesting facts. The book contains many great photographs that compliment the printed material. The size and format are just right and as a reader, I enjoyed it very much. In my opinion it is an excellent, entertaining book, don't miss it!"
1,Terrible!,"My son received this game for his birthday. We have Perfection so I thought this would be fun. After one game with him, the timer kept going, but both sides popped up immediately. Needless to say, now it's useless...one time wonder, and is cheaply made. Although a great concept, I would stick to giving people the old classic, Perfection! We had it for years and it still works."
1,Battery not working.,This battery is not working. I have ordered this battery for Sony Cybershot DSC-P100. I have received the battery on time and I charged it for hours but it doesn't seem to be working. The camera powers up and immediately switches off. I don't know may be I got the wrong one. It is real waste of time. I am going to return this and not going to recommend this to anyone based on my experience.
1,Product Dimension is wrong,"I purchased this knife to house my 6"" Santoku. Product dimensions are stated to be 4x1x6. I could only assume that 6"" was for the length of the blade, making 4"" the natural choice for how deep a blade it could store. The deepest blade you could possibly fit in this is 1.5"". Yes, I measured.I will be returning post-haste."
5,Not Just for Cat Lovers!,"An expert story-teller, Lilian Jackson Braun pulls the reader into her Cat Who stories with the finese of Jim Qwilleran's two feline companions Koko and Yum Yum. Each story weaves mystery with deftly portrayed characters and cleverly detailed plots. No cardboard characters or loose ends in these books. Qwilleran is a reporter with a luxuriant mustache that frequently signals him when something peculiar is about to impact those around him. Murder, mystery, lies -- Qwilleran's sidekick Koko is there to help him solve all the riddles. (Yum Yum helps, too, but she often prefers to watch the two males bend their minds to the puzzles while she stalks bright shiny objects or flirts with Qwilleran's guests.) Any Cat Who book is a delight. And, best yet, it's not necessary to read them in order."
3,Not versions actually used,"I love Animaniacs like the next person. Hence, I'm absolutely in love the songs that were featured. So, buying this CD and listening to it, I couldn't help but feel disappointed. About at least 98% of the songs on this CD are NOT the versions used on the show. BUT the CD does not fail to deliver great, catchy, superbly written songs, musically and (especially) lyrically."
2,"Good graphics, annoying load times/checkpoints","I wanted to like this game. After playing through Splinter Cell, I thought this game would be awesome. After renting the game, I found that the controls are different from the first Splinter Cell. Although the manual says that you can zoom (binoculars) with the C-stick downflick, it's actually a light press of the L trigger. Also, using the SC-20 rifle is difficult to use - the sniper view also requires a light press of the L-trigger, which is the same button to hold your breath. There is another typo in the manual - I can't remember the exact details. I found the graphics to be improved in comparison to the first game. However, the multitude of checkpoints made the pace of the game unnecessarily slow. Panning the camera can make the framerate drop noticeably.My recommendation - rent it for yourself first to see if the game is for you. After playing other stealth action games, Pandora Tomorrow is just not up to par."
5,"Great, Challenging Espionage Thriller!","I love playing this game. Granted, it's sometimes tedious, and is a nightmare for trial and error haters. I however, find this game challenging, fun, and really intense. It is not for small kids, because of the violence, intensity, and occasional language, but I as a Christian am not way too upset with the content in this game. (Meaning it's not over the top.)The graphics are also brilliantly displayed, and make the gaming experience feel real. Overall, this game rates extremely high in my book, and I hope you all get the pleasure of enjoying it."

2,Melissa's Blue Posole,"I was disapointed upon opening my box of posole. One of the bags had been ripped and was scattered all over the box. 1 bag gone.In another bag, the corn had so many weevil holes that the bottom of the bag was nothing but powder. Another bag gone. Now I'm down to 10 bags. Also the hominy looks red not blue. I live in an area that has many Hispanic grocers. Red hominy while not common is available. I have not ever seen blue corn available as hominy which is why I wanted to try it. I haven't tried to cook any yet so I don't know if this is the way blue corn looks before its cooked or not. I hope the weevils don't overtake my pantry!"
5,Semi-autobiographical Dreiser Novel,"I sought this novel to supplement the memoirs ""Dawn"" and ""Newspaper Days"" as a way to gain additional insight into Theodore Dreiser's intriguing personality. I was not disappointed. The book provides information about Dreiser's sexual appetite, motivations, and philosophy. It also is an engaging read in the way that ""Sister Carrie"" and ""Jennie Gerhart"" are. Sure, Dreiser can go on in detail in ways that an editor could have made more succinct, and his sentence structure could become byzantine or odd. But the plot is well structured and the sense of impending doom that crops up is mercifully relented so that the novel does not become as squirm-inducing as ""An Amercian Tragedy."" The reader's sympathy is evenly divided among the principles and the events are seen as fate intertwining with the forces and choices of the personalities. Dreiser even more than Sinclair Lewis is my favorite depictor of U.S. life early in the 20th century."
1,"Not ""high quality.""","Whatever you do, don't order these ""High Quality Paperbacks;"" they are anything but. They are printed on 8.5 x 11 paper, so they are the size of a dictionary. The print looks like it was done on a typewriter. The typesetting is sloppy; sometimes a single sentence or a paragraph in the middle of the page. These look like someone did them on a desktop printer."
4,Some Of The Very Best Tinsel Tunes EVER,"I'm really surprised to see so few reviews of this great collection as compiled by those fabulous folks at RHINO. I found every song to be a major winner, with the exception of Jack Jones' version of Jingle Bells. Now don't get me wrong, I've always liked Jack Jones & even have some of his cd's in my collection; but this is one of the worst covers of Jingle Bells I've ever heard. Maybe it's the arrangement but it sounds like he just couldn't be bothered recording the song. Oh well, it shouldn't matter-every other song is golden & are original versions. Highly recommended."
2,"Jack Jones Fan, Too.....","This is for a previous reviewer who didn't like the Jingle Bells version on this CD. The answer is simple. It is not Jack Jones singing this track. I've found several CDs where the CD company doesn't get it right when identifying the artist or the song title properly, especially on a ""various artists""-type CD."
2,Ultimate Rip Off (LOGO) SMK,"This game is just another version of MK3. It has some new characters that I like, like Ermac and the old sub-zero.It is very crummy and should be bought for the sega saturn. Wouldn't buy if I were you. If you would like to know if i have any other reviews just look for my logo which is SMK that should be at the top or bottom of the review.OUT!(LOGO) SMK"
