4,Really nice printer!!,"It prints photos just as nice as the photo store. Nice features are the negative and slide scanner. Pages print quick too.Only downfall is when one ink color runs out you can't still print just using black. The whole printer shuts down. Also, it says ink is out but I can still hear ink shaking around in the cartridge."
2,LCD has died as well,"I bought this product from a local store, when I should have bought it on amazon and checked out the review for it. I wouldn't buy this product again."
2,LCD death,Yet another dead LCD.Gonna contact customer support. I'll let you know how it goes.Also if it's out of one color like say light magenta it won't let you print in any color not even black and white.
1,LCD died,I gave the RX600 to my wife xmas 2004. May 2006 the LCD died. Epson made me pay $9.95 to talk to support who told me to take it to a service center. The service center informed me that the minimum repair cost would be $200.00.I called epson support back and asked them to google 'rx600 reviews'. Epson support refused to go to some site (Amazon.com) to get reviews of their products. Each time I spoke to support they were emphatic about letting me know they had never heard of LCD issues for the RX600. Strange thing was that each support person repeated the other word for word. Oh welp.I then called Epson's Customer Satisfaction Dept. who is sending me a refurbished model within 5-7 days. Is epson gonna replace this replacement if the LCD dies again? I dunno. Maybe I can ebay this one to buy a Canon or HP.
4,Uniform,Although my son's weight range for this one is correct it is a little bit large. Might want to go smaller size if your child is right on the line.
4,Great Stuff,"The product arrived in great condition and was just what I was looking for. It was stiff upon opening, but after wearing it, it loosened up quite a bit. It's a thinner fabric but seems durable."
3,How do I size this?!,"I have all my son's measurements as well as the measurements and a size of his old uniform, but there is >no< indication on this product page which size I should order.Ordered from somewhere else."
2,Not what I expected,This is not the best of this artist. Not at all what I expected. Not the sellers fault though... the delivery was quick.( Probably wanted to 'hurry up' and get rid of this one.
2,failed twice!,"Owned this nailer for about 3-4 years. I've used it mostly for trim and woodworking projects. Works awesome, when it works. After a couple years of light use it froze up on me and would no longer drive the nail. I had to get it fixed and (luckily) it was still under warranty. Used it for another year or so and it froze up again. Took it in to get it fixed and the guy told me it would cost about $175 and he could guarantee it would happen again after getting it fixed because of how it was built. This time it wasn't under warrenty so it's now a piece of junk. Don't buy it."
1,Quit working,"Tool worked fine for about 5 small trim jobs,now all it does is rev-up and DIE.I own 9 other Senco air tools,some for over 20 years.this airless tool needs some redesigning.I will not buy another"
1,Lacks durability,"Great gun when it works. However, I have gone through at least 4 (have lost exact count) of these guns. Local repair shops cannot work on them so they have to be sent back to Senco. Senco has been great about sending out replacements (covered by warranty) but every replacement has also broken. There is an obvious durability issue. I currently have 2 of them waiting to be sent back and am buying 2 more air-powered guns to replace them with. If you need a gun that is reliable, look for something else."
2,flavordave couldn't be more right,"just like flavordave, i bought one of these for my shop. i figured it would be a great tool to take for small installations where bringing out a hose and compressor takes more time than the actual work. needless to say, mine also had its issues--- winding up and winding down without shooting... and nails sticking out of the project. i used mine very few times... when it did work, it was great... but i need a gun that is 99.999% reliable, so i too will stick with the hoses for the time being. On a bright note, the good people at SENCO are EXCELLENT concerning warranties and their products. They took care of me immediately after a simple email."
2,Defective design does not hold up,"I am a professional finish carpenter working in cabinet shop. I have been using this gun daily for three months. In the beginning it worked just fine, but it did not hold up. I do NOT use it heavily, mostly to install crown molding and scribe, perhaps a strip of nails a day maximum.It started out not setting the nails properly, and now the belt is not driving the nails at all. The belt driver winds up and then winds down and won't shoot. Out of 8 carpenters in my shop who purchased this gun, I am number 6 to have to return it due to this defect. We have been instructed not to purchase anymore until they work the bugs out.It may be a fine tool for a handyman or a casual user, but if you're a professional and need a reliable nail gun, I would recommend sticking with a compressor and a traditional air brad nailer."
5,Hey What took you so long?!,"it's great to have these shows on dvd & video , it was good to see mark & company back in the action after it seems like 20 year absent & i wondered why they did'nt do it sooner geez the pet peeve i've got is the butchered bonus battle of the planets retitled g-force on the dvd come on fellas & gals i felt like i was having my teeth pulled just induring it yuck get it together. besides that i'm delighted with volume one& two. 7zark7 & one rover one are funny come on where's the next volume of battle of the planets i'm hungry for more jason , mark , tiny & kehop & princess keep the memory flowing thanks a fan this great stuff."
4,great book - bad cover,The photos in this book are beautiful. The information in this book is excellent. The cover on this book is terrible. I opened this book a few times and the cover fell off the book. I re-glued the cover and the problem with that is the old glue marks show. Improve the cover and this is a completely wonderful book about Paris.
2,zoom out! zoom out!,"I am an architect, and had high hopes for this book when I saw that it was focused on the buildings and details of one of the most beautiful cities. However, I was sorely disappointed. It's almost entirely zoomed in shots of building details. I kept wanting to say: ""zoom out!"" It's one thing to have a photo of a beautiful street or building, and then to have photos of several details. But to have a book full (almost exclusively) of details is very dull to look at."
1,Sub par book construction and content,"As some of the other reviews have stated, the cover falls off of this book. Also, unless you are interested only in architectural detail and not the whole picture of Paris with its more famous landmarks, then you are not going to be very interested in this book. Considering the book's title, I was expecting a showcase of the city. Instead, I got an architectural design mini-textbook. I feel I could've put together a more interesting book of Paris with my own tourist shots. Save your money and get a better constructed and more interesting book."
5,"Her Privates, We","An excellent book on WW I. Oddly, not carried in our fabulous library system.Title based on a quote from Hamlet and is greatly misleading."
5,Great gift for someone who has everything.,This was purchased for the broker of my mom's real estate office. He obviously makes good money and can buy pretty much anything he wants. He has a Harley and he and his wife ride it frequently so this was something that we were sure he didn't have. They gave it to him at the company's holiday party and he took off the watch he was wearing and put this one on right away. It's great looking and is a quality brand. GREAT!!
5,HD Bulova Watch,I received my purchase in a timely manner and the Harley-Davidson Watch was exactly as I expected. It is a very beautiful piece of Jewelry and I thoroughly enjoy wearing my Watch when I leave my home. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to review my purchase.
5,"Great shipping, GREAT product",My husband is so hard to buy for and he really was thrilled with this Christmas gift. He is a large guy and the band fit great.I love the ease and shipping time of Amazon so much.
1,Can't get on,"Yay, a two-fer package. BOOOOO on the usage. My friend laughed HYSTERICALLY at me trying to get on. Even when she held if for me. I held it for her also, and it took about 3 tries to get on with out flipping out. Then it was my turn............I gave up! (not because she was laughing at me, if she thought it was funny, glad she got a good chuckle out of it. But I wont be able to use this if I cant get on by myself. AND NO!!! I am not built like a tank, no skinny mini either like the picture on the box. Would NOT recommend this even at this cost!"
1,The sap runneth over,"Wow! This song is by far the worst wedding song I have ever heard. It is so sappy it makes me cringe. I'm not saying she has a bad voice, or the lyrics are bad...but it sounds like some kids CD from the 80's. My fiance loves Slipknot. I think he would rather dance to Pulse of the Maggots than this crud."
5,A Song for My Son,"I ordered this song/CD for my son's wedding. Every time I heard it, it brought tears to my eyes. Thought it was a beautiful tribute to the mother/son relationship."
1,NEVER HEARD THIS SONG BEFORE,"i HASVE NEVER HEARD THIS SONG, IS THERE ANYWHERE i COULD HEAR IT BEFORE i BUY IT??????"
1,A Song For My Son On His Wedding Day,"Where is the sample of the song?I want to hear the artist before I purchase the product.Please add a sample, quick!!"
1,Sorry I Spent the Money,"I am very disappointed in the quality of the lyrics on this CD. I could have written this in my sleep. The words are shallow and trite and childish. I ordered this to play for my son's wedding this fall, but he would be embarrassed rather than touched by the gesture. Wish I could get my money back."
1,"overpriced pap never used it twice, sounds awful","I am a professional wedding DJ with over 2000 events undermy belt. I HAD to get this awful song for a bride's mother who insisted I have it. It's over-produced, she sings in a tinny falsetto, and while the lyrics aren't that bad...a bit trite and predictable, it was not worth 25 bucks for the album which I NEVER used again.Butterfly Kisses, or One More Day or Becuase you loved me are Much better choices."
1,Waste of Money,"[In my opinion,] the words are shallow and resemble something a 10 year old would compose. [I felt] the recording quality was poor. I was looking for a song with depth and reflection, and found it in Lee Ann Womack's recording ""I Hope You Dance"". That's what we chose and there wasn't a dry eye in the house."
1,Too Corny!,"I was so disappointed when I got this song. It's so corny and old fashioned. The words make it sound like the grooms mother is crying because he's going off with ""her"". This is not at all what my fiance was looking for to dance with his mother. It may be the first song for the groom and his mother, but thank goodness it's not the last!"
5,MY SON'S WEDDING,"I purchased this single CD for my dance with my son on his up-comng wedding, July 7, 2001. Before I even heard the end of the first lyrics I was in tears. I know there is no way that I will be able to keep from crying when we have our dance together on his wedding day! I would suggest that any mother having a son getting married order this CD. It contains all the feelings and words that any loving mother would have for her son.We also have two daughters with weddings coming up, so we ordered two CDs, ""A Song For My Daughter On Her Wedding Day"". It is also a must!!"
3,Better for younger readers,"This book started out really well, and I thought I would like it a lot. But really, nothing exciting happened. My favorite part was probably when the boys are telling the secrets that they know. Also, why does the principal believe that Marc always has something to do with a fight when he was the one being beat up? Better for younger readers."
3,Good sounding chior,This is a very old German chore that does a fine job in interperting the songs of the landle of Germany
3,slow start,"I always look for a good series of science fiction novels, and being a bit compulsive, I begin at the beginning. Unfortunately, in contrast to her other novels, I found this one rather lugubrious and static, its action stilted. Fortunately, I perservered, as the remaining novels in the series are utterly superb and up to her usual standards. This is uusually the reverse: a series starts out well and then gets over-played, developed beyond the poitn they should have been. At any rate, though this is the worst of the series, it should be read."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"This odd series I didn't find too interesting. Maybe I would if I was an invading alien sex therapist. This is almost a horror story, with how creepy it is in parts. Condescending aliens treating people at times how people treat animals, which perhaps it part of the point?"
5,Xenogenesis Series Just Wonderful...All Of It!,"Before I selected an omnibus called Xenogenesis from the Sci Fi Book club (containing: Dawn, Adulthood Rites, and Imago), I had never heard of Octavia Butler.Am I glad I selected this accidentally when I joined the club (Mainly because it said it had three books in it). While most of the free books I received were average to no good, The Xenogenesis Series was exceptionally great!"
4,"Great Novel, not Great Value","4 stars because the Kindle store recommended this novel without showing me the bundle. This novel is the same cost as the whole Xenogenesis Trilogy bundle. Save your money and buy the bundle! If you have any interest in the Sci-Fi genre, read this Trilogy! Sci-Fi is at it's best when it makes you question assumptions about the world you know, and Octavia Butler knew how to deliver."
3,"Good book, very interesting but...","This is a good book, well written with an extemely interesting premise--advanced (and very alien) aliens come to earth after a nuclear war and ""save"" mankind but turning humans into something else. The aliens call this a trade, a trade of genetic material in which each the two parties become something neither was before. The humans aren't thrilled with the idea and there lies the conflict. This is all well and good and certainly original and interesting but the humans in Butler's story seem too self destructive, too violent, and too unreasonable. At times Butler's aliens seem more realistic and more diverse than her human charcters. Still, it is both startling and thought provoking. And certainly worth reading. Just don't expect it to be perfect."
5,Wonderful story and characters,"This is an excellent trilogy. I've re-read it several times. Although Butler tends to write end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it books, they are really about the will to survive and about hope. Her characters, especially the women, are each in their own way very strong individuals who learn to cooperate in order to live. The fact that the cast of characters are of several races but race is not a negative issue is an interesting motif. Her image of the earth changed by nuclear war, alien intervention, and humanity's return to hunter-gatherer bands is fascinating."
5,"Read it, get the rest of the series","""Dawn"" was my first experience in Science Fiction. I couldn't believe I waited so long! I inhaled all three of the Xenogenesis books and am now reading her short stories, ""Blood Child."" The biotech stuff really intrigued me, especially since I work at an immunology research laboratory! Cancer and genetic diseases play a very important part in Ms. Butler's work.I find the race issue to be secondary in her work and that her feministic approach to life is much more in the forefront. Either way, of course, being the subjugated being in one's world produces a certain world view - where one sits determines where one stands - something I can definitely relate to!Between the medical, gender, racial, human and moral issues brought out by the wonderful story-telling, there is an enormous amount to think about."
5,excellent and lean sci-fi,I read a lot of sci-fi and find that in every book there are some descriptive paragraphs which I skip to get to the meat of the story. I read the entire Xenogenesis series and was suprised that there wasn't a paragraph that I skipped. It's beautiful and powerful. It's sci-fi with emotion. It's one of the best novels I ever read.
2,I'll pass on the next 2 books in this trilogy,"The human race almost destroys itself in some future conflict. Aliens come and ""rescue"" the few survivors, place them in suspended animation, and prepare the survivors to re-inhabit the earth. Although the concepts of this book are interesting, I just never really cared for any of the characters. It isn't that the author's character development was lacking - only that the characters weren't all that likable. As the humans are ""re-awakened"" and begin their training to re-inhabit earth, they start to divide themselves into rival groups. At times I felt like I was watching the TV show ""Survivor"", and not much caring who won. Maybe if the characters were more likeable I would have enjoyed the book more. I think I'll pass one the other 2 books in this trilogy."
5,"Great Book, unjust cover art","I've first read this book back in 1995 (give a take) after finding it in a used book store called `The Bookmonger'. Loved the book, but, it's clear from reading the novel that Butler intended Lilith to be African-American. What the publishers were thinking by depicting her as Caucasian on the cover of the 1987 hardcover edition of Dawn is beyond me."
2,audio is very very bad,"see reviews for other vols 1,2,3 all these dvds audio produced badly. I would recommend checking others before vols 1,2 or 3"
2,More theoretical than practical,"We had this book for the course in data transportation and protection taught by the author himself, Yarlagadda. The book provides you with sound mathematical background for techniques used in encryption etc. It covers all the mathematical aspects of Markov chain processes, public key encryption, cryptography etc.It was just too boring for me but was a required course in a way <sigh>.Yarlagadda has a lot of practical experience working for US defense projects in commmunications but he wasn't able to transform that knowledge either in his books or lecture (or slides should I say!)"
4,Necessary medical drinks for kidney patients,"I bought three cases of different flavors. Best price was Amazon, with the repeat delivery feature and Super Saver shipping."
4,Tasty supplement,"I bought this for my dad, who is a new dialysis patient. He likes the taste and I like the nutrition."
3,American Idol Sucks!!!,"American Idol sucks! Just wanted to state that. If you really want to get the full Queen experience, start with Live at the Beeb. Then Queen, Queen 2, Sheer Heart Attack, so on and so forth. Get them all.There's no way around it. Queen has so many songs that were not showcased in the popular music genre, but were nothing less than fantastic. If I had to do away with one, it would be Hotspace. Get all others. You won't regret it. By the way, Metallica redid Stonecold Crazy, not the otherway around. Oh, if Queen were to go back on the road they need to get that Miller guy. Can't remember his first name right now, but he's Freddy Mercury re-incarnated. An amazing performer. Saw him in San Antonio a few years ago and he brought the house down. Had everyone on their feet throughout the show. Just thought i'd share that. Til then ""The Show Must Go On!!!"""
4,good effort,"One of the veterans of the 2nd generation of reggae artists, Cocoa Tea (Calvin Scott) is still making credible albums 10 years after his his debut (and arguably his best) lp ""Wha Them A Go Do, Can't Stop Cocoa Tea.""This effort, from 1992, offers the listener a good look at Tea's form of reggae. Tunes like ""Jump and Spread Out,"" ""Bust Outta Hell,"" and the title track are prime examples of his infectious grooves and why he continues to be a favorite in reggae circles."
2,good concept -- poorly made,"I have owned two of these items, both broke after a few weeks normal use. The plastic piece from which the water comes out simply blew out with the force of the water and could not be replaced. The concept is good; the product is inferior."
4,Very different from MBTI,"I was very surprised to read this book and find Jung's description so different from the MBTI descriptions. I'm far from an expert, but maybe it is a question of style of writing rather than content. Since this is the orginal work that MBTI is based on, it is naturally not the place to find an answer to that question. I would recommend this book to anyone who want to understand the origin of the MBTI. I don't think it is necessary to read this book though. Remember that this book was written at a time before the use of tables, matrixes, and figures. The ideas are complex and described in a verbose manner. It is not easy to understand the details. It is not difficult language just hard to discern which sections are significant and not. It would have been great with a modern reading guide and explanation of how Jungian psychologists use the theory today, but that is another book. If you have such a recommendation, I would be grateful with a comment to this review."
2,Too soon,"Dennis McDougal has not done his homework on this one. This book came out too soon, and all the facts were not known at that time."
2,The Yosemite Murders,"After page 70 or so I became bored and started skimming(a very bad sign)I tried to find something interesting in the narative but failed. Towards the end of the book there are two half pages, and one whole page, that actualy talks about the crime and what might have happened in Yosemite. I have read a few thousand true crime books and would rate this one towards the bottom of the list."
3,Yosemite Murders,"While This Book Is well wrote,I feel that it consentrated more on the the FBI,and inside the lives of each victim rather then the actual murders themselves.probably 4 chapters out of the entire book focused on cary stayner and the yosemite murders.The rest of it is full of eulogies and talks about the victims families. It just did'nt focus on the crime enough for me.Not exactly a good read if your looking on the subject at hand."
4,True Crime Author Strikes Big,"I find this book an incredible model of premier investigative reporting. How Dennis can write so well without personally knowing his subject I'll never know. I enjoy a well-written novel also, but combining these existing facts with well-crafted writing is genius. This book informs whatever the reader may have heard or read before, bringing to life an individual's aberrent world. The author's comprehension of the antisocial mind is brilliant."
1,Please don't buy!,"I bought this for my son this christmas and he used it about 5 min. and the left joystick broke. so I thought, ok, it's just a fluke and i reordered another one and got it today and that controller did the exact same thing.poorly made. don't buy.cute controller though but won't last but a few minutes."
1,"Zero stars, bubba! Everything you've heard is true!","Worth nothing! I tried using this controller for about a day and the left joystick broke! Clean off! There's nothing you can do with that!I also gave one star becuase that's all they let you do. Don't they understand that you need a left joystick? Zero stars is more like it.I tried using super glue cause I paid, like, $20 and the left joystick broke again! Trash! What were they thinking? I need the left joystick! It's one of the ways I do my super moves, man! Broke clean off, it did! Worth less than nothing!"
5,Gift for grandson,My unbelievably rambunctious 4 yr old grandson LOVES Max and Ruby. Took him to ToysRus and told him he could pick 1 toy.He picked a Max and Ruby DVD. I was really surprised...but it's what he wanted and daughter appreciates the few free minutes it gives her to do whatever. So I bought him 2 autumn holiday related DVDs and suggested to his great gram to buy winter holiday DVDs.
5,My son loves this,"I have a 3 year old who is crazy about thomas the tank. He has so many of the trains and accessories. When he sat on Santa's lap, this is what he asked for. I have no idea why. It really doesn't seem like a big deal to me and is more expensive than the other engines. But my son thinks it is the best! He is always talking about his sodor railway repair engine and how cool it is. And all of his little friends that come over to play trains seem to think it is really cool too. This is the engine that everyone wants to play with. I guess it's a boy thing!"
2,okay til it breaks...and it will,"This gun is one of those products that you'll wonder how you ever did without until.....it eventually breaks down. And it's guaranteed that it will. I had the Air Free 41, along with the cordless brad nailer, and I was as happy as a clam with both of them. That is until they both eventually broke. The brad nailer broke on me 5 times and the finish nailer twice. Fortunately the HDepot carried them so I just returned them for a new one each time. Unfortunately, they no longer carry these items for reasons I can only guess might be that they were filling containers full of broken guns for return to Senco.If you aren't going to use these guns for your livelyhood, then by all means get one. Make sure you have a backup compressor and gun just in case. By the way, Senco in south FL is no longer fixing these guns. The Dewalt rep will be happy to accomodate your repair for approximately half the cost of a new gun. What a bargain."
1,good Idea poor product,"I went through 5 of these guns and all failed. Luckily home depot took them all back. I spoke with a senco distributor who told me he sold 200 of these guns and had 180 returned. He said senco sent him some prototypes to try that all failed. He told senco that the gun wasn't ready for market, but they brought them out any way. I use senco air powered nail guns on a daily basis with tremendous satisfaction, but this gun is a loser."
4,Problem fix,"I Have used this item off and on over the last 4 years. It was used when I bought it. The main problem people are experiencing with this is the clutch. It gets stuck and the nail gun makes a little chirp as if the battery is almost dead. All you need to do is remove the nail track frame. Just take out the two screws by the head and one on the tail causing the clutch to be exposed. Notice the belt is on one side on a metal wheel. There is an adjacent wheel that slips inside the first wheel. Take a flat head screwdriver and pry out the stuck cluch wheel. Once its released the belt wheel should spin freely. I think the area gets gummed up so maybe a little lube in there may help. After I got mine unstuck it became stuck the very next fire, After that no more problems. If you can't get yours fixed just click on the ""sell yours button in the upper right corner of webpage. I'm sure someone would love to buy it for parts. It has many cool parts in it.God bless"
1,2 guns down,"First gun lasted about 3 clips of 2"" nails. Then made a beep noise and refused to fire. Replaced with another unit which lasted less then 1 day or 50 nails. It worked then DEAD. Nada. Zippo. Called customer service 800 number. They said there is a problem with some of the clutches. I asked which serial numbers.They do not track the problem with serial numbers. ha ha. They said to check for a green dot near battery. No green dot. So what? Post Tool in San Franciso has been good. Got refund. When this thing fired it was great. Good balance lots of power etc.Made in China. 2 consecutive defective units with serial numbers 10's of thousands apart. yeah."
1,Review of remodeling company owner.,"Unfortunately I would love to give this gun a better rating but can't. My first one broke down on the second day of light use. I finally got it replaced and the second one lasted a full two hours before a ball bearings fell out of it and again it died. I got it replaced for the third and final time and this one broke down on the second strip of nails.I have gone thru three guns and still have an almost full box of senco trim nails to throw in the garbage!! What the hell was Senco thinking???If someone from Senco is reading this please take this advise. TRY TESTING YOUR PRODUCTS BEFORE SELLING THIS JUNK TO THE PUBLIC!!!I was really hoping to replace my paslodes with these because of not having to buy gas canisters, but I guess that hope is gone.If you definitely have to have a cordless nailer, then get a paslode angle finish nailer. They are far from perfect, but they generally work and can take some abuse."
1,Senco AF41 needs major work,"It is unfortunate that a product like this can make it into the commercial market place. I just finished reading the reviews on this nailer, and regrettably, I had already purchased it. My experience is similar to others who had the nailer fail after using only two clips of nails."
1,I Don't work for Paslode,"I run a good bit of trim. I loved the convenience and reliability of this gun for the year or so that I used it, and then it dissolved. I heard parts rattling around inside and opened it up. A metal cover has fractured, the aircraft cable that wraps it was cut and pinched, and I can't find parts easily. For almost 20 years I have loved Senco tools, but I do not consider expensive bread and butter tools to be throwaways. It also gave no warning whatsoever. Great one minute, dead the next. Anyone need batteries and a charger?Finally, I don't abuse tools, always kept it in its case, and used Senco nails. This tool has no excuse.A follow up:I called Senco and they agreed without fuss to fix the tool, which a local shop did quickly and for free. Now I am back to my air free addiction. I still am concerned about long term reliability, but must compliment the company for standing behind the product."
3,Some songs are missing!,"I bought this release thinking it was a proper album, since I didn't have any of the songs on my other Uriah Heep albums. I later found out it's actually a compilation of most (but not all) of the SONIC ORIGAMI and SEA OF LIGHT albums from the later 90's. The songs are pretty good - there are a lot of good rockers, especially on disc one, although disc 2 tends to be a little ballady for my taste (that is, too many bland, slower songs). I find the material a lot better than the somewhat boring albums from the late 80's/early 90's - songs like Sweet Pretender are really great, catchy, rocking numbers.My main suggestion is, though, if you're a completist - buy the proper albums as this collection is missing a few songs from the albums, although it is about half the price also."
3,looks different,"came with gold writing instead of black and is missing that little bow and button,the packaging looks more real than the bottle,pretty cute, but not as cute as the picture,..."
2,It broke within 3 months of purchasing it,"This prouduct is/was extremely pleasureable. I would have given it a 5 out of 5 BUT, the wire was started to bend and break after a few weeks of having it. Then I had to be careful that I didn't break off the wire from the control part because it was bending. After a couple of months, I wasn't careful, and the wire broke off. CHEAP peice of CRAP. I ended up throwing it away within 3 months because the stupid wire was so cheap it broke!!"
1,The Most Horribly Designed Electronics,"This product has a circuitry issue. It does not correctly hold batteries and when batteries are inserted and the product turned on, it starts an electrical fire and burns through the plastic casing. DO NOT EVER PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. I thought it was a lemon, but when amazon graciously sent me another one IT DID THE SAME THING. Do not ever buy this horrible product."
2,"Nice, while it lasted.","I got this on recommendation from my sis-in-law. It was my first foray into vibrators, and I enjoyed it. It wasn't too intense and was a great addition to sex with my husband, though it could get a little slippery and hard to hold onto.This felt great, but alas, it broke after only a few weeks. The wire attachment popped off where it is soldered into the bullet. I was really disappointed with the poor craftsmanship. Especially because once it broke I went looking for another, and found one that is MUCH better quality for only a few dollars more.Overall, I would not recommend this item. Unless you are VERY gentle and NEVER tug the cord, it will probably break pretty fast."
4,Given Up For Dead,"Given Up For Dead, by Flint Whitlock, is the story of a group of American POW's, the majority of whom were Jewish, who were taken to a concentration camp after they were taken prisoner during the Battle of the Bulge. The author does a good job telling about these brave men who were used as slave laborers contrary to the Geneva Convention. Their treatment was a crime that, unfortunately for many reasons, went unpunished after the war. For many, survival was a miracle. A lot of the men interviewed for the book are still suffering both mentally and physically some sixty years later as a result of their experience at Berga, a sub camp of Buchenwald. Although this book isn't written in as interesting of a style as the other recently published book on this subject (Soldiers and Slaves by Roger Cohen) it is still a must read for all."
5,jojo all the way,this series thru me for a loop you do need to appreciate the game to understand the anime and also get past the fact that the story goes in a backwards way either way it is a fighting game story done with anime so appreciate it for what it is none the less i enjoyed and do not regret my purchase
3,lots of local Nepali details,"I think the real ""guru"" of love is Goma (wife of the main actor), not Ramchandra (the main actor) as suggested by his daughter in the story. Really, how would a married woman invite her husband's mistress back to their matrimonial home and let them have the master bedrm, so that they can do whatever they like in the rm, while she sleeps next door with the 2 children? But anyway, this is not the focus of the story. The story is really about a forty-ish Nepali man getting lost of himself and then back to normal, and the author tries to throw in local Nepali details, eg poverty, the importance people place on money & ""face""-preservation, their belief in gods (and there're many in Hindu). The book is written in simple English & easy to read, I finished it in 3 days."
2,Forgettable,"I read a lot of South Asian literature and this book just does not stand out. It was a quick enough read and the character development was good. I definitely understand all the characters thoughts and motives and I felt for them, but in the end, the story didn't do much for me. And there was something about the happy ending that just seemed too Disney. After all that suffering, everything works out great for everyone in the end? No thank you. The only thing interesting about this one was the setting - Nepal and the political details."
2,Not a book for someone from the indian subcontinent.,"The book brings no real surprise if you are from India or a reader of contemporary indian fiction (a suitable boy). Its a simple predictable story, not particularly rich in details."
2,Not so impressive,"I had heard some big comments about this book. I think thats because readers were expecting to read more interesting novel by The Auther. But, when i read the book i didn't find anything to impress me. The character build up in this novel is not impressive. Auther tries to relate the story with contemporary events in the country but that has nothing to do in fact with the title and mean theme of the book. Goma in this novel is shown so wide and kind hearted, which of course doesn't represent the women from Nepal. Goma is a nepali women and nepali women can't act that way. The character of Malati is also not understandable. Readers can't get enough from her. Her actions in the story simply don't make any sense!However, there are some good things to get from this. Auther tries to tell the reality of a middle class teacher in Kathmandu. It, more or less describes the life standard of such persons even though they are educated."
3,Advice on D199,"D199 is in no video. He is only in the Reverend Wilbert Awdry's Thomas book series. If you buy the complete collection, look under Enterprising Engines and on the story Super Rescue."
3,best Jeannie cd on the market,"Jeannie Seely possessed a wonderful dry voice. But this unfortunately had bad sides to it. For though she sounded good on slow songs, there was just too much of it. I admit her voice is more suited for those types of songs, but there could have been more upbeat stuff available on this cd. Also there are no linear notes and the songwriting identification is kind of confusing.Now for the compliments. If you're into 60's country girls, one should check Jeannie out. Her voice is instantly recognizable and not every country person's is. This includes her hit ""Don't Touch Me"", but also check out ""Welcome Home to Nothing"" and ""A Wanderin' Man.""Hopefully someone will make a collection of her Decca/MCA material soon."
5,Forgotten country star,"Jeannie had one major solo country hit plus a few lesser hits. She also had some success as the duet partner of Jack Greene, though those tracks are not included here. She sounds a bit like Tammy Wynette might sound without the cry in her voice, though Jeannie's voice still packs plenty of emotion.The big hit that Jeannie is remembered for (if she is remembered at all) is Don't touch me, which has been covered by many country singers including Tammy, George Jones and Lorrie Morgan. It is a heart-wrenching ballad, typical of many of the songs here although Jeannie can lighten up when she chooses, as in I'll love you more than you need.Long after her hit-making days were over, Jeannie continued to perform on the Grand Old Opry and at other venues. Despite that, her music is generally hard to find these days. Nevertheless, if you enjoy predominately sad love songs sung in a traditional country style, you will enjoy Jeannie's music."
1,The imformation about football was terrible,Matt Christopher obviously was not a football player. He new nothing about what football is really like.When he talks about the football games he uses terms that the '50's would use. The story has a plot only 3 year olds would like. This book should never have been published.
5,great dvd introduction to Theology of the Body,This is an excellent way to start in learning Theology of the Body. Perfect for church groups. West gives four talks on the basics of Theology of the Body along with question/answers for further discussion. I would recommend that you also pick up the study guides for your group too.
1,Epic Fail,"Having Bought 2 locks from On Guard I wish I never had. Given the price I was expecting it be trouble free for years. The first lock, a cable lock, would stick and not let me lock or unlock without a lot of key twisting and turning. After the time it took over 10 minutes of attempting to un-jam the lock to free it, that I threw it away in fear it would not release next time. The second, a U lock, Seized up in similar fashion while trying to leave work. The lock was so weak, that when in frustration I wacked the lock on the bike rack, it broke in half. Luckily I got to ride home that evening without having to cut the lock off. The best long lasting locks I have found are the ones with the twistable numerical lock where you pick the number combination, no key needed. Do not buy On Guard unless you really like to gamble and ultimately loose."
5,Great!,"Recommended! Love this ,especially ""The Right Stuff "",""Ejection"" and my favorite ""Aerospaceage Inferno"" . Also comes with a much longer ""The Right Stuff"" with a totally different mix. Buy this now!"
3,Doesn't work as expected,"Another reviewer mentioned that the flatbed isn't wide enough to hold other trains. That's definitely true and very frustrating. You might be able to carefully balance another train on the flatbed, but it falls off as soon as you move it. My son doesn't even play with the flatbed, although he will occasionally use the crane to pull trains onto the track or along the track. Other than that, it's as well-made as all the other Thomas Wooden Railway items we have."
5,We love Thomas!,"My son loves the Thomas and Friends trains and we are unable to buy them where we live. The train is great. The crane pivots which is great so that it can pick up things on either side of the track. My son was extremely pleased with this train. The one downfall is the picture. He is three years old and was expecting the Breakdown Train with the yellow crane. When it came, he did not understand that this was the actual train and he would not be getting the yellow crane. I would recommend changing the picture. Young children do not understand that it may be different than the actual picture. Other than that, we are totally satisfied and love the Breakdown Train. We would highly recommend it to anyone who likes to make their trains crash and have another train come to the rescue."
3,Tawny-Red,"Very powerful vibrations but too its small, the size is about as big as a pen cap. I rated it a 3 because of the size it is too hard to keep in place."
5,Good book for Jews as well as Christians,"Gilman is a very good person to read if you want to get a Jewish theology based more on the Bible and less on Greek philosophy. A pretty basic book, but it does contain fresh insights and clear writing."
2,"Good impressionist, limited material","Purchased this video after seeing a couple of clips of Mr. Caliendo on YouTube. He does some really funny impressions, but there is a lot of repetition due to the limited material. After five or ten minutes it starts to get old. You can only watch his head-bobbing imitation of President Bush so many times before you start wanting to see something different. Cannot recommend this video."
3,Not his best work.,"I'm a huge fan of Frank Caliendo. I bought the Giggles Shaky Cam DVD off of his website and the Make the Voices Stop CD and both Frank on the Radio CDs. That's all hilarious, wonderful stuff. Then he released this half-hearted hodgepodge of half-bits that is funny if you haven't seen him before, but a disappointment if you're looking for new material. I feel like this was phoned in. I'm sad."
4,Funny Guy - Good Impressions,"Frank is a real talented guy. He can do so many voices and faces that it is amazing. See him change from Bush to Robin Williams and then ""Boom"", to John Madden. His impressions are superb; his material could be a lot funnier with better writers. Who am I to say...he is booked in Vegas on a 10 year contract. Hmmmm....is that good thing??"
5,Great New Resource!,"Great book! I purchased this book a few weeks ago and it is a fantastic resource. I just ""sold"" myself to a top-notch marketing firm! The price is small and the return is great. I highly recommend this book to anyone going through job interviews."
1,"Good in the beginning, but...","This towel worked great at first -- really polished the crystal. Within a few months, though, it totally lost its absorbancy. It just smears the water drops around and makes the glasses look awful. You have to wash it with very little detergent and cannot use dryer sheets, so it requires special handling in the laundry. Not worth the extra money or the Riedel name (I love my Riedel glasses however). I am throwing it away and getting a less expensive, but hopefully better microfiber cloth. Or maybe I'll go back to linen....."
2,BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THIS,I gave this a low rating because it almost works too well. It is very easy to have the towel grip the cup and apply to much pressure as you are trying to wipe it down. I broke a very high quality wine glass with this - simply by cleaning! Again - works well - but a little too well.
3,microfiber,the best i ever had after a while if you use it in bar or if you are a barback barender i will last a long time the only bad thing is that it get dirty very quick and cant get the drops of dirt out i woul look black aftera while
5,Perfect for Riedel Glassware,"We love our Riedel glasses. LOVE them! When I read that cleaning them required a microfiber cloth, I went direct to Amazon and sought this specific item. I trust Riedel to make a cloth worthy of cleaning their amazing glasses. So far, I have been nothing but happy with it. It's a great cloth, easy to clean (you are supposed to do it at a very high temperature), and does a great job of drying our glasses without causing them harm. Not a bad price either."
5,A must have,"If you have nice wine glasses, you are crazy not to have this! It works great and is easy to use!"
4,Riedel Cloth,I work at several wineries and these cloths are an industry standard. They polish all glassware absorbing and leaving no lint. They are the same material used to clean sunglasses so they are designed not to leave even the smallest abrasion.
4,Shop before you buy,"This is a fun game, but I would advice someone to shop before you buy. I bought this at a Dollar Tree for $1 so you don't want to waste your money."
5,Allows us to feel like true aficionadoes,"The wealth of information included by the Laubins, and their heartfelt respect for the American Indian, permeate this book. Many tipi construction books these days are written by would-be hippies--but the Laubins come across as the real thing. They had real contact with the tribes who made the various designs and they understood the distinctions between them. Better yet they have done an excellent job at getting these techniques across to the reader. An excellent resource for our business and home pursuits alike and the only book on the subject we recommend."
3,More detail direction needed,I found the book to wordy. There wasn't enough details to build a tipi.
2,Just OK,The story was pleasant enough but never really seemed to go anywhere. I have ejnoyed many Alan Dean Foster books in the past but this was not up to the level of quality that I expected.
2,Fosters roller coaster,"Alan Dean Foster can be an exasperating writer. Sometimes his books are among the best but sometimes he just bores me. This is not one of his better efforts.One would be better served by reading any Flinx novel or alomost any fantasy by him. I always thought his best was ""Into the Dark"" But that's just me. . .you have to find your own.That said this is an exploration of the ""alien capture turns person into a specimen"" and it evolves from that premise. With Alan Dean Foster's usual twists on that: a talking rational dog. Much more rational, and funny than the protagonist who comes off kind of an idiot sometimes actually. Etc. It all seemed very familiar to me somehow. I slogged to a halt about three quarters through so at least I won't give away the ending. I never got there. I'm sure there will be something from him that fires up in the future. This ain't it."
3,"A Light, Fairly Mindless Read","If you're looking for a light book to read just to pass some time, this is a good candidate. Nothing heavy here. Outside of the utter improbability of the main premise, a completely spurious first chapter (with an introduced but unused character), and a miracle occuring to help resolve the plot, the book's decent. I know that sounds a little odd, but it's true. Plus, there's the added bonus of vocabulary improvement: I've never seen so many multi-syllabic words in one book before. I rate it at an adequate 3 stars out of 5."
4,disappointed,Not up to Foster's usual high standards. Wordy and not enough action. Probably will not buy the next books in the trilogy.
5,Couldn't put it down!,"This was a nice refreshing change to the last couple of books I'd read. While the first bit had me questioning to stick it out, once the ball got rolling at the abduction I was hooked. I loved the character George, simple but just as adorable on page as a dog in real life. Rating: Idea premise: A, Content: A, Overall rating: A!"
1,White cheap flimsy,"Image of ""Spectrum 35900 Over-The-Door Hanger Holder"" is misleading.Product detail truthfully has it stated as 'white', but the product images as of now, dated 2/13/2012, shows a metallic, brushed stainless steel looking picture with a solid feel. (at least I expected a faux metal looking plastic)Of course, I only looked at the image and bought it, never read the detail 'white'. So when I received it, which I found a cheap bending white plastic hanger, I thought they sent me a wrong item.Simply image is misleading and I will not put this cheap white flimsy plastic on my bedroom door. Nor will I spend time for a return process and send this to the post office.If seller refunds me fully with a shipping return, I may send it back spending some time of mine. Till then, this will be stored inside my tool drawer."
2,Too narrow for door,"This would be a great over-door hook except that it is too narrow to fit over any door in my house. Wish I had read all the reviews first, thought all over-door hooks were the same width. Will order another type but will check the width before buying. The inside meas. of this hook is 1-2/5"". May be a standard door size now - my house was built in 1970 and all my doors measure 1-3/4"" wide."
5,"Basic, sturdy and does what it should do.","I bought four of these. I needed a few to hang in/near the laundryroom so I could hang my husband's shirts straight-from-the-dryer and also got one for our bedroom so I can hang out an outfit for him or myself at night before bed (eliminates searching in the morning). I am considering a few more for the kids' rooms. Sure, they're not pretty like some of the options out there but they are incredibly affordable and being white, blend into the door color at our house really well."
5,sturdy over the door hanger,"Excellent sturdy over the door clothes hanger. I bought three and have used them a lot. Recommend drilling a mall hole and installing a 5/8th wood screw in the top of door to prevent them falling off. I also found them at Bed, Bath and Beyond for three dollars for two."
1,worthless,"On the plus side, this product is made from a very heavy white plastic - sure to be durable. On the negative side, the product is nonfunctional, it is made too narrow to fit over a door. I have just flushed $5 down the toilet!"
2,Too narrow,This purchase was a waste of money because it could not fit over my door apparently it wasnt wide enough. I will be returnining it. Very disapponted.
3,Plastic - picture is deceiving,"It looks like metal in the picture, but it is not. So far it works fine, but it was not exactly what i thought it would be."
3,wasn't quite what I had in mind,I thought this would taste similar to Twinings Rose Tea but unfortunately this has more of a light fruit flavor. Which is ok. However it wasn't want I was looking for.
2,Titan Silver Skateboard Trucks,The trucks were faulty when assembled to skateboard the wheels did not rotate properly.
3,Can't beat it for the $,I use this pump for hight pressure car club events and inflating the kids bike tires. So far its great.
2,Broke within ten times of use.,I bought this to inflate airplane tires on my cessna. I used it a total of five to ten times and the compression unit broke. I would suggest buying another brand of compressor.
1,ANOTHER WASTE OF MONEY,Purchased this air compressor and very upset. Turned it on and started to inflate my tire. After 3 minutes of running the compressor was creating smoky smell and died. Now it is making noise without providing any air flow.Do not buy even for one US dollar.Waste of money and time.
1,Quickly broke,"This started coming apart the second time I used it. I wasn't expecting much, but this was complete junk. Pay a little more for a better quality product."
4,Works Good for its purpose!!!,I've used this thing for 4 years now and it still works great. I primarily use it for inflating low automobile tires. It can bring my totally flat minivan tire to 30lbs in about 12 minutes. I also use it on my atv tires. I just bought another one on amazon for my wifes car. Works great for me!!!
1,Don't buy this,"This worked OK for around two months. Then the light broke. OK, the compressor still worked so I could use it. For a while. Then the snap-on tire connector broke and that was that, I had to throw it out. When it did work it was very loud and kind of slow. Spend another ten bucks and get something else (with a screw on connector -- no snap ons)."
1,Good for Starting Fires,"First time and only time I used it was to inflate a motorcycletire. The bike was idle for 2 years and had 10 pounds in thetire. When I turned it on, it danced and bounced aroundon the driveway because it is so light. Had to hold it againstthe tire with my foot so it wouldn't flip over from jumpingaround. It sounded like it was working hard when connected.I connected it for about 30 seconds, then testedpressure with a tire gauge. Only got a pound more.Reconnected for 1 minute, got up to 12 pounds.Hmmm...This is going to take a while....I figured I let it run for a few minutes while squeezing andwatching the tire carefully. After about 3 minutes I look downat my feet and see it belching smoke. I quickly unplugged itbefore flames. This thing is way too cheaply made."
1,Piece of junk,"Worked twice, then just stopped working. Blew fuses on cigarette lighters in both our cars. Yes you get what you pay for. Think. You can pick up a blow dryer for your hair for about same price; and it will work for a few years, For this product to just stop working after a few uses indicates this manufacturer has no qualms about selling defective merchandise.Amazon should dump this product."
2,Will break rather sooner than later,Worked fine for normal tires. One day I decided to inflate small spare tire in my Ford Focus. Ford recommends 60PSI for that tire. When the preassure reached 50PSI this crappy compressor just broke. Looks like some seal blew.I guess you get what you pay for.
2,Great and then horrible,"This product worked absolutely wonderfully and was great to have around for the roughly 10 months for which it worked. After about 10 months, it went bad and started blowing the cigarette lighter fuses."
1,...,"As they say, you get what you pay for. This unit worked only once and now will not inflate above 30 psi. Purchased beyond 30 days, so Amazon.com will not accept the return. [$$$] down the drain."
1,"Complete garbage, don't rely on this thing.","This compressor is just this side of useless. You buy cheap you get cheap. Then again if you need a bright yellow doorstop, this could be the product for you!"
1,"Poor quality, questionable reliability, snap on connector is first piece to break","Air hose is way too short for practical automotive use. It's only approximately a foot (12"") long. Also, the snap on connector was the first piece to break for my compressor. Not sure if I'm lucky or unlucky. Compressor, work/emergency light and cigarette lighter power cord still works, but without a snap on connector, this compressor is rendered useless. Stay away from this make and model compressor, and stay away from Wagan brand products altogether if you can help it. Have a new Slime compressor and I've used many different Slime tire gauges. Highly recommend that brand."
4,One of the saddest times for the US in WWII,The author was a very brave man and fortunate to have survived one of the worst experiences in WWII. It breaks my heart to find out all of the horrible atrocities that occurred in WWII while we at home were oblivious to the fact. This book opened my eyes to the inhuman acts that man can inflict on other men.
4,About Bloody Time!!,"It has been about 20 years since I ran around with a Yo-Yo, pretending I was Princess. And I have seen many different Anime since then, and I'd say my tastes have matured. Expecting the worst, I watched this DVD, and I tell you, it is amazing what I had forgotten. 7-Zark-7 was from a different anime, Casey Kasem was the voice of Mark, the hero. Some of the characters were annoying, but it was great!! Death, smoking, violence, all that are missing from today's children's entertainment, since were worried about scarring them. I loved every minute of it, and felt some of the old thrill I had when I was a child. And to top it off, the DVD had the original Ninja Science Team, Gatchaman episodes. And another Gatchaman Series, I hadn't known about.The only thing I didn't like, was these episodes focused too much on Mark, and that Volume 2 was released before volume 1. But, other than that, it is a great buy."
4,Battle Of The Planets on DVD!! Finally!,"Great! Awsome! The picture is a little grainy (ok, a lot grainy), but wow, its Battle Of The Planets, and its on DVD! Cool menus too! Bring on the rest of the series Rhino!"
4,what can I say,This is one of my favorite tv series from the 70's and 80's. I was so happy to hear this was finally coming out. The only thing i was disappointed with was there's only six of these and there's not my on the way of dvd features. But the eposodes themselves make up for the lack of extras. give it a look.
1,I wish he had left the cheese out of it.,"Denis Boyles is a great and insightful writer. But couldn't he leave the cheese out of it? The cheese is not responsible for France's devious foreign policy, and duplicity towards straight-shooting America. The cheese has done nothing but being good and nutritious to people in France and in America."
1,American ego,"After reading the majority of comments posted for this book, it is clear that most Americans think you are either with them or against. No middle way. If you don't agree with every American whim (even tragic ones such as Iraq), you are anti-US. Sick and tired of it. Get a grip"
1,This Controller Stinks,"Believe me Literally!I didn't get the hulk controller but I got a Marvel Spiderman controller from the same company.Just stick to the original controllers.You'll be lucky if it works for one game !my spiderman controller didn't even work for one that's right ONE game.Heed My Warning ""Don't Get This Controller"""
1,ATTENTION! This bit requires an Arbor!,"The image above is misleading. It shows the bit with a shank. But the bit does not come with a shank. The package says you need a Vermont American No. 22690 Arbor. But Amazon presently does not carry this item. Unless you have a No. 22690 Arbor, or perhaps an equivalent, this will be unuseable. I give it one star for the misleading image, and the time wasted."
5,Hess Books are the Best,"Norah Hess books are the best books I have ever read. Fancy's attitude keeps you wondering what she is gonna do next. Once you start reading, you won't put it down."
2,Now I Know I Don't Care for Huckleberry Tea,"Since I didn't like the flavor of this tea I am not a good person to judge this particular brand. There are so many black fruit teas that I love, such as Black Current, Peach Coconut and Pumpkin Spice to name a few. I would always reach for those before I would go for this tea. Luckily, I only had to purchase one tin so unlike many other teas on Amazon where the cost reflects 6 boxes, this time I took a chance and it did not pay off for me. I do wish this company and other companies would indicate whether the flavorings in their teas are natural or artificial. I have a feeling that if the flavoring in this tea is artificial that would negatively affect the flavor but I can't say that's the case because the tin doesn't make that clear. If you know you love Huckleberry Tea then you should give this one a try."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this because I ran out of another brand of Huckleberry tea and temporarily couldn't find it for awhile. I assumed all Huckleberry teas would taste the same. This was not very good comparatively. If I'm allowed to mention the other brand, it is from Chris' Tea Cottage (Bigfork, Montana) You can find them on web search."
2,Hinge problem is major issue,"I got it - I liked it as it provides a quick way to record tasks and notes which you don't want to taken the time to log into your Palm....then, after 5 months - much like many other users - the damned hinge broke. It no longer attaches to the Palm so any advantage it had over any other voice recorder is gone. Until they make a stonger hinge - I'd recommend buying a normal digital voice recorder"
2,"Great idea, but hinge breaks","The GoVox is a great concept, and works reasonably well, but mine has found a home in the bottom of a junk drawer. Why? The hinge broke off after only a few months of use - and careful treatment. And, the lack of a headset jack and loud speaker makes your personal memos (""Call back doctor"") into public announcements when you're doing playback. I covered the speaker with a bit of tape, which helped make it quiet, but also muffles the sound a bit. I *do* like the beep when you start/stop recording."
1,Nice try - but a waste of money.,The GoVox for Palm V seems like a nice idea - record a note while driving when your hands are not free to jot. But I found the design not robust. Sometimes it doesn't record even with carefully correct button sequences. It just seems dead. Other times it begins recording when stashed in my pocket and bumped. The buttons are not sufficiently recessed to prevent this. I replaced it once in case the first unit was simply a lemon. But the second unit behaved just the same. It turned out to be a waste of money and time for me. I'll go back to a slim hard case and work on my human memory.
2,Just sits on the Palm,"This recorder is in now way integrated with the Palm, other than that it sticks to it. It's just a voice recorder in a funny looking case. I'd buy a more rugged cover next time, and get a compact and ergonomic voice recorder."
4,"Good, but not for everyone","The good things about this course are its systematic approach to learning the language, and its combination of written and audio material. The one shortcoming is that the course covers quite a bit of ground, and there is not enough reinforcement of previously learned concepts.Also, be aware that this is mostly a written course, and the material on the CDs is an adjunct. This is _not_ a course you can do in your car."
4,"Pretty good, inexpensive.","This is actually a decent little course, but if your budget allows, the Living Language Russian Basic/Intermediate course is better and has an advanced course for further study. But if you're on a tight budget, this is actually pretty good."
5,student,"my order was delivered promtly, and condirion of book and cd were in excellant condition.amazon has been very reliable"
1,bad discription,I assumed I would have received 4 towels not one If I had this information I may not have bought the towels
3,"ok, not great",very repetitive game play. become boring after about 30 min.good time waster if you need a short game.
4,Warning to people without HD Widescreen televisions,"Although this was an amazing game that didn't get the exposure it needed to become a real blockbuster, the reason I am posting this is because of the people who complain about the cluttered HUD.If you do not own an HD Widescreen television at least 1920x1080 resolution, MOST games on Xbox 360 and Playstation 3 will be ""smashed"" to fit your screen, as they are both next-gen systems optimized for use on HD Widescreen displays (Sylpheed being one of many optimized games).Why you would even buy a next-gen system without owning an HDTV is beyond me to begin with. I thought people learned their lesson when Dead Rising came out and you couldn't read the text on a SDTV.In closing, I highly recommend against buying ANY HD videogames without an HD display, as you will most likely strain/damage your eyesight trying to play them. They should stick that in the manual warnings I think, not that anyone ever reads those..."
4,Undeserved attention to a great game,I also don't understand why this game has gone by without much attention. It's really fun and the graphics are amazing. About the controls you can always customize so that's not a big issue. When I play the game I recall the dog fighting scenes in space from the Robotech Macross Saga Series. Stunning!
4,Great game,"The story line is creative. There are some things about the game that are very annoying (like the the lock-on feature, that seems to pick enemies at random). I have to admit that the game is addictive. Graphics are fantastic, and the missions are challaging, but not impossible. Try the demo on xbox live first, but although short, you will find yourself playing the game all the way through over and over."
3,Not too good.,"I bought this game to support Game Arts, the makers of Grandia... My favorite game of all time.Their game direction has fallen a bit since the PS1 though...This game is a cluster bomb of bright colors and trails, confusion, and obscure objectives.Most of the time I had no idea what I was really supposed to be doing, and just shot down whatever enemy the game decided to highlight. Eventually though, you really have to focus if you want to progress, and I just found the process to not be all that much fun.The controls are finicky and even on the lowest sensitivity I was jerking my ship back and forth trying to center it on a target. You have an overdrive, but it's only really useful when you are very, very, very far away from a target... So... It's not that useful in this game.The story isn't all that compelling either, though the dialogue isn't bad, the voice acting could be better.All in all, this game looks better than it plays.."
4,Review of Nature Noir,"The book is very well written, describing the journey of a park ranger through stages of his career. His love of nature led hiim to this career choice, but then he realizes the dangers of the position and decides to become trained as an armed defender of the parks. Anecdotally, he describes situations he was in that were dangerous and how people use the parks as hiding places and then endanger others. The books made me wary of walking in nature unprotected. A good read though."
2,Failed Potential,"In the introduction to his book Smith outlines an exciting career of Ranger Service around the country in National Parks and the like. This book, however, is not about that part of his career. This book contains short recollections, neither poignant nor amusing, of Ranger Service in a doomed recreation area (soon to be dammed). The book is more a history of the planned dam than anything else. Smith's fellow Rangers are portrayed as hopeless men who are simply putting in time before retirement or the building of the Dam. Skip this one."
3,Poor writing with some good stories,"Jordan Fisher Smith's writing is extremely poor. However, some of the stories he writes on are interesting despite his lack of proper grammer. I am pretty sure he uses the word ""I"" 20 times in one page multiple times in this book. But if you can get through the poor writing the book is fairly interesting."
2,"Slow, Ponderous","The book started with a bang and ended with a whimper. It was tedious reading by and large, as the Park System is viewed by kind of the Willie Loman of Rangers. He also, as is common in this day, blames all the world's ills on America's and particularly George Bush's failure to get with the program and turn America into a socialist paradise.He also spent twenty years with his co-workers, but has about as much insight, overt compassion, and intimacy with them as I have with the people with whom I wait for the bus. I'd really have to suggest skipping this depressing and needlessly politicized book; the ramblings of an embittered man. It reminded me of a poor-man's ""Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance""."
5,Thomas S.C. Ruffy,I was very pleased with my purchase and I know my grandson will be so excited. Thomas rare and retired are what we are looking for and this fit the bill.
2,Does Not Fit,I just purchased this item. It claims that it was made for the 40 gb Ipod. It does fit on snug but the wheel does not line up well and you cannot charge with the case on. It is hard to get on and off so it is not a great case if you use you Ipod Alot
5,Works perfectly,"These guides are exactly what I needed to help align the boat when loading onto the trailer. Installation took a little time, but was easy enough to do. They seem to be made solidly, and should last for years. A most satisfactory purchase."
2,"Slow, Plodding Book","This California case of a spurned lover who conspired with a real loser to eliminate her lover's spouse, and in a twist the lover himself, was a fair read at best. While the author did his best to describe the police investigation into the murders it seemed long in details and short on excitement. (even with the twist) Not recommended."
1,"Deadly Mistress: A True Story of Marriage, Betrayal and Murder","It's a tough read. It does not keep my interest. I will finish it because I started it, but it is one I could definitely put down."
2,Interesting read...,"This is the story about a doctor who was having an adulterous affair. He hired a hitman to kill his wife so he could marry the mistress. The hitman and the mistress were having an affair unbeknownst to the doctor. On the orders of the mistress, the doctor and his wife were both murdered."
5,A Must-Use for Praxis II-Takers!,"A great buy for the fraction of the cost of the ""official"" practice book! Use Amazon and use this book for your studies - it has everything you need to prepare for this assessment."
5,Excellent,"This is book is excellent. I am in one of those accelerated programs for Ohio and after just one semester, I thought there was no way I could pass this test. I read the book a few times and did 4 of the practice test even the ones that were not my grade level. I passed the test. Excellent. Love the outline style of the book, when I was not familiar with a term I looked it up in another textbook and made notes on this."
3,Solid test review,"I used this book to study for the PLT and I probably studied it through and through for about two weeks prior to the test. On the test day, I thought I blew the test out of the water, come to find however, I barely passed. However, I dont blame the review book on this, I personally believe the test is too sugjective and the graders are biased. This is an aside from the review of the book, but a word to test takers, Im a Marine, and my philosophy on education is that of high expectations, accountability, responsibility, and structure. I think my responses didn't jive with the popular philosophy of education of the times. The test prep book is good on a whole, but be wary of how you respond"
4,Helpful!,"I used this book to study for the 0041 and 0042 exams. I found the guide more accurate in predicting what types of questions would be on the 0042 exam than on the 0041. I found the 0041 exam questions to be more difficult than the sample questions in the book, but the book served as a good starting point for studying. If you're taking the 0041 exam, study the time periods religiously! This is probably the best guide out there that is not more expensive than the exam itself.I ended up passing both exams with excellent scores!"
5,Great book!,"This book is definitely the one to get! This book has TWO practice tests for each test, whereas the ETS book only has ONE test. This book also reviews important concepts and explains them clearly and in an organized fashion. Highly recommend!! The ETS book is not as helpful."
2,Not for Elem. Ed: Content Knowledge!,"I'm just writing this review to help people avoid my mistake. I bought this book thinking that it would have some information for the Praxis II Elementary Ed: Content Knowledge. My thought was that since it said that it covers K-6 and grades 5-9 that it would be of some use....but it wasn't. This book covers what would most likely be on the test for someone going into Curriculum and Instruction (which as most of you probably know is completely different).If you're confused as to what practice book to buy for Content Knowledge, I recommend the Praxis II Elementary Ed:Content Knowledge study guide by Learning Express. It helped me a lot.I had to give this book a low rating by default."
4,"A touch out of date, but still a good resource.","This is a good, one-stop resource to use as a refresher before the Praxis test. As it was written in 2006, the format sections (and, therefore, pacing suggestions) are no longer accurate. Still, the content covers everything you might learn in a number of college classes: Educational Psychology, Classroom Management, and Foundations of Education, to name a few."
4,"A helpful book, but the tests are too easy","Having now taken my Praxis II exam, I have to say that this book prepared me for the multiple choice mostly. The practice case studies in the book are too easy. The scenarios they give are farily basic and the questions are straight forward. On the actual test, things were a little more in depth. I liked the book, but I just fet like it had me a little over confident. Use this book, but check out some other materials too."
3,"""Why My Praxis II Study Guide Eyes Poped-Out...""","Overall this Praxis II study guide for the principles of learning and teaching is well orangized. However, it lacks the real meat and content for what's really tested. It's sort of generic and cookie-cutter. You'll find it a little too easy when you see the actual test questions on your testing date and you'll be sorely disappointed you spend weeks reviewing this guide. I got the most Praxis II test mastery and confidence from teachingsolutions.org/praxisii.html. The Praxis II Test Coaching from Test Score Breakthrough can help you get a higher score and pass in less time than this. I don't want to bash this guid too much because it is a good reference. Just don't make this Cliff Notes guide your bible and you should be ok buying and using it successfully."
4,PLT PRAXIS 2 Cliff Notes,"This book is condensed from the other study guides I have, however there is a lot of extra material for other tests in there that you don't need and have to pay for. Good info however."
4,"Very useful book for reviews,","I used it for my praxis 7-12 exam. Lucky me, I have a very good college preparation so the book was just for review. It was useful, I passed with no problem, but be aware that it is not so well done, the information inside is not so well organized, they tried but some things are mixt up, or reapeted under different chapters. It is very good for reviews and for people who have experience, already, with that information, if you don't have experience or you are a beginner some other books, materials might be necessary!"
4,Works well on short grass,"I've been using this mower for about a month now and it is very nice on the well cared for parts of my lawn.Good stuff: Quiet, light, easy to adjust, no cords, no gas, no smell. The kids actually think it is fun to push around. I really don't mind pushing this thing around once a week where I hated getting my old corded model out.Bad stuff: Where there is taller grass (5""+) it often just flattens it. It also does not cut thicker grass at all. One could look at that as a positive because the crab grass now sticks out above the rest of the grass and you can pull it. Creeping grasses (the kinds the grow sideways first) will not get cut at all. I guess that's where the ""suction"" of a high speed mower will pull these blades up to get wacked. Or maybe I just have a lousy yard. It's certainly no putting greeen.All in all I am happy with this purchase, but like all mowers it is not perfect and know its limitations."
5,Good tape,"Captures great in a Sony TR7000 camcorder. Works great in both Hi8 and Digital8 modes, though only captures 60 minutes in Digital8 format. The tapes retained clarity and sound quality after multiple edits. The material of the tape is the second-highest quality used in Sony tapes."
4,Good basic tapes,These are good basic tapes for use in my eight year old Sony Digital8 camera. I hope they keep making these tapes for at least a few more years. Why get a new camera when I can get really good video with all the features I need to transfer them onto DVD using this older camera?I got a decent price on Amazon buying them one tape at a time. It still comes out to be cheaper than driving over to Best Buy - and they come right to my door.
3,High Quality,"Sony Always has extremely high quality. Although, it sometimes jams in my recorder, it is normally my fault. Great Choice."
3,Just what is shown.,"Not anything to say. They were as promised. The price when I got them was decent. If you want these tapes, and the price is good, get them."
5,I've read it three times. A great book.,"A planet in terminal orbit, one side searing hot, the other frozen. On the fringe between the two stands Nightside city. In this erie cyberpunk tale, a detective rubs elbows with all sorts of low-lifes in a quest to determine whether Nightside city will soon see the light of day...and who's behind it. Masterfully presented with wonderful descriptions, great dialog, and visionary descriptions of future technology. Evans makes it all come alive."
3,"Not Bad, but Not Great either","The Case of the Whitechapel Vampire was quite a disappointment considering that Sherlock Holmes adventures should be nothing less than AMAZING!In this mystery, the master detective is investigating a series of murders involving an Anglican monastic order whose members are picked off one by one by what seems to be... a vampire.The major setbacks lie in:1) The poor choice of actor for the leading role of Sherlock Holmes in Matt Frewer; obnoxious, conceded, and overall not likeable, his was a poor performance indeed.2) The lack of that sense of mystery that must accompany Sherlock Holmes at all times.In short, it's a decent plot, a familiar setting, and a mediocre cast.Though far from being a masterpiece, by no means is it a bad movie, as it will provide for an evening's entertainment."
2,The Case Of The Whitechapel Vampire,"This is a horrible movie. yet i find another bad vampire movie. come on this is supossed to be a vampire movie, since when did sherlock holmes chase vampires or people dressed up as vampires. this is a murder mystery with a guy dressed as a vampire it should not even be concidered as a vampire movie. the only thing that kept me interrested in it was sherlock holmes the actor did a great job. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you don't"
5,An Amusing Sherlock Pastiche,"You know, I gave Frewer a scathing review in his ""Hound of the Baskervilles."" My main complaint being I did not picture homes as Max Headroom. Nor did I want to see Holmes acting like Max. But Frewer made a few Holmes movies and improved with each one. This the acting here is fine and does not distract from the story. The script, however, is not the best. The writer took liberties which make our Holmes here more human. I prefer the slightly more aloof and untouchable Holmes of Jeremy Brett version. But all in all this is a movie well worth viewing."
3,It's okay..,"Sherlock Holmes has to save a bunch of monks from a ""vampire.""It's not bad, but Basil Rathbone will always be Sherlock Holmes to me."
3,"""Case"" could have been Better","What was frustrating for me is that there is already much better fodder than this with which one might have made a Holmes/Dracula (ala Vampire) connection - Saberhagen's Book ""The Holmes-Dracula File"" literally picks up at the end of Bram Stoker's Dracula and leads the reader and Holmes (& the erstwhile Dr. Watson) down some very amusing and ultimately satisfying trails. There is no non-supernatural denoument and it is believable. I wish this series would revisit this material and perhaps contract with Saberhagen to produce this story. Vamp & Dracul lovers alike would be thrilled!"
2,"Interesting, but skirts the edges of an inappropriate ralationship.","Liam Neeson is a disillusioned Roman Catholic Brother, Michael Lamb, instructing boys at a reform school in Ireland. Shortly after he's charged with the care of abused, delinquent, epileptic ten-year-old Owen Kane (Hugh O'Connor), his own father dies. Both emotionally needy, the man and boy develop a fondness for each other that's clearly inappropriate, though not sexual.Feeling desperate, Lamb takes a loan on his pending inheritance and runs away with the boy across the sea to Wales and finally London, naively oblivious of the consequences. Because both were oppressed by the head of the school (Ian Bannen), you'll almost want to root for them getting away, but the film keeps skirting the edges of the inappropriateness of their relationship, with a shocking ending.There's good acting, music by Van Morrison, and the film might keep your interest mainly out of sympathy for the boy, hoping it will turn out ok."
4,Not your mother's Catwoman!,"If you're expecting Julie Newmar, think again--this Selina Kyle is based more on Frank Miller's ""Batman: Year One"" in which Selina was a dirt-poor East End hooker who had just about all she could take and became a jewel thief to get herself out of a life of pain and degradation.Borrowing from both the ""Catwoman: Her Sister's Keeper"" miniseries, a stint in ""Action Comics Weekly"", this Selina is a fascinating young woman who is at war with herself, her desires, and her world. But she's strong, capable, and a surprisingly warm protagonist capable of heroism--despite experiencing confusion about her feelings for Batman. She also gets a bit of female bonding with a fresh-off-the-bus animal activist, which helps blunt some of her sharpest edges and make Selina a 3-dimensional character that readers will take great delight in getting to know.Especially recommended to fans of the 1980s and early 1990s comics, and animated television series."
3,Super Reader,"The A. A.s (Asprin and Abbey) have written a pretty short Catwoman novel. The title has a double meaning. A man named Tiger has got just a little bit too close to Catwoman's usual haunts. Given that he is into killing and using wild big cats for fun, that is just about guaranteed to make him her number one hate target.Batman, as ever, is lurking in the shadows."
2,Odd tasting miso soup...,I had bought instant miso soup in the past and the taste was very similar with what you get at your usual sushi restaurant... so I ordered this one and... I shouldn't have ordered without trying because the taste is very strange... not pleasant... now we're stuck with 12x4 of something we don't like... hopefully someone else can avoid our mistake...
2,This is honestly pretty bad...,"I assumed that everyone complaining was just being picky or unreasonable -- I've bought cheap miso soup packets from Trader Joes that were just fine. This was good value (or so it seemed) and lower sodium than most other packets I was looking at, so I bought it. However, it is actually awful. Really. The taste is poor, the texture is poor, it's just bad. At least it's organically bad?Subscription cancelled. An expensive mistake in retrospect."
4,A Blending,"This little book is a real treasure of information weaving the archetypal energies into everyday life. If you are a student of Tarot, Astrology and Alice Bailey writings Mr. Price's reflections will allow deeper insights into your own alchemical process."
5,EXACTLY what I needed to get through my creative block!,I have had this book for a while -- but I finally picked it up as I was trying to make some choices for a new house I'm moving into.....I have been conflicted with my own personal style for a long time now. The questions stimulated me to really dig into what I wanted! It is more than a design book - it's a book to help you find yourself and create a living space that is suited just for YOU!!!! GET THIS BOOK!
2,Not Too Realistic,"I bought this book to find out another perspective about how to survive nursing school. It's not too realistic in the sense that it doesn't address instructor bias, inconsistant grading, and nurses in clinicals that aren't very helpful. This is written from a perspective that all is perfect in nursing school and it isn't. Waste of my money."
5,Great illustrations!,"The tips for a happy life are easy to implement and don't require any major life changes, yet they will make your life more enjoyable. The best part of the book was the wonderful illustrations - they made reading the book even more enjoyable."
4,Very short and very sweet,"This is a slender, sweet-as-sugar paperback book offering little ideas for making life more joyful. It put me in the mind of a number of similar types of books, such as the God's Little Instruction books. Perhaps the most distinctive element here are the illustrations for each and every tip by a 7 year old girl from Nevada. The target audience seems to be parents with children, but a wide audience could find some happy,useful thoughts here."
3,Mental Escape,"Reading this is like reading a ""feel good"" greeting card. I felt like getting some crayons and coloring in the pictures. Yeah, I really liked the illustrations."
3,Guide For Living,"This small book only took about 10 minutes to read. That was the best thing about it for me. It was confusing to me because, although many of the tips were for adult couples, all of the illustrations were by a child. It just didn't do anything for me."
3,Maps R us,"If you have never played the game, then play it before you buy the book. You will be disappointed if you try to follow the hints in here. For the rest of us who are die-hard fans, this makes for some good reading, but because it came out before the numerous updates, the info in here is not the most accurate. The maps, however, are the biggest thing in its favor, you get to see the entire cities in one view. buy the book only if you are a hard-core fan, otherwise you won't enjoy it quite as much, there are better walkthroughs on the web."
2,The layout was a scattered disaster of information!,Although I found that many facts were explained along with some great support I thought that the general layout was awful. I also believe that like some others it was missing some vital information that would have brought more life to the game for those that are incapable of finding things on there own (that inclueds me so dont take offence :) ) My suggestions are not to waist your money and look up the stuff on the web. There are a few great walkthroughs out there!
2,It's Not Very Good....,"The first fallout strategy was better. The walktrhough is especially weak and it misses a lot of the fun parts of the game. If you want a good strategy guide on this 5 star game, just search the web for the no mutants allowed web site. To the book's credit though, it does have a nice listing of the items and weapons, although some of the items and weapons are missing."
2,A ok source of Fallout 2 info,"Although the maps and the section on useless items were very helpful, the book exposed little on how to complete subquests. The weapons section tells nothing about weapon improvements. It tells you things that are made obvious by the game itself. Someone looking to find helpful information should try looking at fan websites."
1,Don't waist your money!!!,This book was published before the game was released and half of the facts they give in it are wrong. If you're looking for a hint book keep looking because this one won't help you.
5,Unknown Gem,"This is a great video of an opera that should be better known than it is. Everything's right and there's some familiar music that you'll wonder where you heard before. It's a very clean transfer, too."
4,Dynamax Med Ball,"I have the 20lb model which amazon unfortunately no longer sells. Dynamax medicine balls are durable, better made than most and work for almost everything that medicine balls can be used for save one. If I could use this for slams it would be a five star product."
4,Magical memories from a magical time in a magical place!,"I discovered this book by chance, and was so, so happy to have found it while reading it. I am Norwegian, but was born and raised in Lebanon, and recognize so many of the funny, sad, beautiful incidents Anwar Accawi describes. It's a wonderful book! And a loving tribute to Lebanon, the best place in the world - we were so lucky to grow up there in happy times!"
5,One of my favorite books,This book grabs you from the first page and takes you on a journey that sticks with you long after you have reading this incredible book.Accawi has a masterful touch. He's profound yet clear. His story make you laugh out loud and break your heart all in the same paragrpah.You can't go wrong with The Boy from the Tower of the Moon.
3,Some great articles that skim the Surface,"This book has great articles from some of the best coaches ever such as Wooden, Dean Smith, Henry Iba, and Morgan Wooten, but never gets too in depth. Great book for a coach looking for ideas here and there, but not great if look for real specifics."
2,They sold out,Ofcourse these guys sold out all the concerts but they also sold their souls...this is not their best and well Listen to their earlier work and you'll see.
1,Carlosroco,"As a big fan of Molotov, I was very dissapointed with this record, honestly dont waste your money on this record. And if you are a fan of this group and still want to be, dont even listen to it. This group started with a great album (¿Dónde jugarán las niñas?) but since then, they are going down........Not a fan anymore....."
1,!?!?!?,"I think someone forgot to tell Molotov that Rap-Metal/Rock-Rap was Dead. Had potential, but the simple riffage and annoying rapping killed it for me."
3,Reliable card that has its flaws,"Don't get me wrong, I like this card. It was truly plug and play and worked as soon as I installed it. However, my biggest gripe is with the internal USB and Firewire slots. They are practically unusable because of their placement at the top of the card. I have both a Sawtooth G4 and PowerMac MDD, and there was not enough room to hook up either a USB thumb drive or key FOB. I haven't tried any cables yet, but I imagine the fit will be very tight. I'll have to invest in 90 degree adapters to get any use out of the internal ports. It would have made much more sense to put these ports in the back of the card, where there is much more room."
2,Not so sure.,"I bought this to add extra FireWire (IEEE 1394) ports to my PowerMac G4. It's been problematic for all three jobs I applied it to: external hard drive connection; DV camera connection; and ethernet over FireWire. In each instance, the connection seemed fine at first, but within a few minutes deteriorated to unusability. Switching to my machine's native ports solves the problem every time.I allow two stars instead of zero because I haven't put much time into troubleshooting it. I found no drivers for OS X on the manufacturer's website, where a notice says none are needed.This card definitely didn't work out of the box for me, but computer hardware being as variable as it is, it might work for someone else."
4,Better than I had expected.,"This is a good flick. It has the suspense and tension I expect in a horror movie. Such ingredients as one friend slowly going over the edge, another friend escaping the witch on the front porch of that spooky cabin, the devil and the witches on the shore while the last two make good their escape. Love it!"
5,Interesting,"I saw the premiere of this movie on Friday night in the theater, on a night where there just happened to be a full moon, which added to the overall atmosphere. The story line was strong, the sound production was excellent, and being a man who enjoys a good horror film, I bought a copy of this movie after the show to add to my collection. Good production overall."
4,"Review of Ramon Ayala's ""Quemame Los Ojos""","I thought the album sounds nice in the typical conjunto sound of Ramon Ayala. The songs that stood out were ""Quemame Los Ojos"" and ""Loco,Loco""."
3,"great seller, dissapointed in the pop ups in the book",I expected more from a CLIFFORD book and the pop up pages were not great. Perhaps good for an older child but did not elicit a response from my grandson.The story was cute but not a great pop-up book. Good seller though.
4,Nice book,"My three boys (3-1/2 yo and 20 mo twins) collect the Clifford series. I didn't realize when I ordered that this was a board book, but I'm glad we bought it. I like that there are books my little guys won't destroy! We don't let them handle the older son's books, so this one is theirs. It's a nice simple story that they can relate to. We read it every day, and the older one can ""read"" it to his brothers!"
4,Adorable,"This book is really cute, but it is a board book. I didn't know that when I bought it. My daughter loves it though."
2,To little room,"I have purchased several of this model, and the fit on all is a little to thight. The model in my size, 6, is wery close fitting. The trousers give little space for movement. On the other sizes, I bought from 2-6 (big family), and they are all a little to close fitting. The waistband and the bands for closing the jacket are in some kind of polyestersilk (or lookalike)and the ravel up. The fabric though, is quite good, soft and easy to move around in. If the suits where a little wider over the shoulders and the hip aerea, they would be great.I also bought one heavy siut from Piranha Gear. Much wider, and more martial artist friendly. It cost twice as much though, but it is four times better."
5,great recipes,This is one of the finest cook books I have come across. The recipes are easy to follow and the product comes out great. I would recommend it to anyone who loves to cook like me. Happy eating.
5,light show in your own space,I received this candleholder on time and in good condition etc.etc.etc. But when I used it with a tealight candle I was amazed at how mesmerizing it is. The light flickers and dances off each of the shapes and is truly beautiful.
5,Still love mine,I've owned this for about 4 years and it is an item that every visitor feels they have to touch.The weight of this thing is much like that of a paperweight and the light distribution is gorgeous. That perfect little sparkle for a perfect little table. Beautiful with a tealight.
5,beautiful,I read the reviews before purchasing five of these for our foyer. They are absolutely beautiful. Quality from Sweden.
1,Very disappointed!,"I paid $40.00 for this jersey, which I believed was going to be a fair price.Turns out that I was wrong.From the day I received it, the numbers & letters began to come off on the back of a chair, whenever I sat down.If that wasn't bad enough, the 1st time I washed it (cold water, gentle cycle)the numbers & lettering practically all disappeared!I voiced my complaint to the seller, and requested a refund, but there has been no response.I recommend people do NOT buy from this vendor."
2,flawed,"We used these once and the heat from the candles resulted in an imperfection in the glass in one of the candlesticks. The crystal no longer appears uniform--there is a big bubble in it. These were a wedding gift and Nambe's return policy is 30 days. Our wedding wasn't for more than 30 days after we received them and we didn't want to use them until after the wedding, so that was not particularly helpful."
5,Best book on account planning we've seen yet.,"Another Outsource Marketing firm favorite!A great book about communication planning written by Jon Steel, the Brit who heads account planning for Goodby Silverstein & Partners. Steel and his agency are best known for developing the ""got milk?"" campaign.Truth, Lies & Advertising describes the process of gathering consumer insights and turning them into potent communications.It offers great advice about developing advertising objectives, using consumer research, and working with creative people.Steel writes with enthusiasm and sympathy for the creative process, but he's also savvy about business realities and committed to results.If you've ever struggled to reconcile the art of creative with the science of business, this book should interest you."
4,Good Intro To Account Planning,"A useful and provocative survey of the discipline of account planning. While a little short on techniques, it manages to create a compelling argument for planning, and may be useful to sell the need to management. Sort of an extended pitch for Goodby, incidentally, although that's to be expected in most of the insider advertising literature."
3,BIG OUCH--BLOOM's is NOT updated,"I just receieved my book, and thumbing through it I was pleased it held more than a passing outline; it seems to hold at least a summary of explanation to help with context, especially where theorists are concerned. However, I got to the pages where BLOOM's Taxonomy is, and big ouch, it's not updated to reflect the now correct order. We've already had teacher workshops in BLOOM's, and before I left school to work full-time (last year), the school indicated it had changed. I hope that the rest of the info is current, but now I'm a little concerned."
2,Attention Vestal Fans;,"Listen folks, if you are a real Vestal fan as I am, skip this album. Choose instead one of the others that are just Vestal. This album is a very poor sample of her gospel work individually. Basically, it's just another Bill Gaither issue of his Homecoming stars. I like the Gaither folks, but it certainly isn't what I was hoping for here. Very dissappointed...."
5,nearly 57 year anniversary,I purchased this cd for my parents... not on the occasion of their 50 year anniversary but almost 57. My mom has Alzheimers and doesn't know my dad or anyone anymore. But we play this music for both of them... for mom just because good gospel music touches her soul and for dad because there is a song that has ministered to him.... I Couldn't Have Made it WIthout You... this is exactly how he feels about Mom. Tears stream down his face as he listens to it over and over. God has really used this to bless my parents.
5,50 years celebration,"this cd is filled with love and powder of god in then sing ,and you can see love they had for each other they are a beautiful couple"
3,So...when do we start working out?,I gave this 3 stars only because of two reasons. I thought the beginning segment involving the weights for upper body was great. You can most certainly feel the burn. And the last part...the gluts and leg workout is Phenomenal. But that's it though. I thought the actual aerobic segment wasn't very challenging. I didn't get anything out of that part. It's not bad...but at the end of a work out...I'd like to feel like I just got done working out. It's a Good beginner Video.
3,Why are they sweating?,"I'm not very athletic person, especially after 1.5 years after my baby was born and I did not do any workout all this time. So I was looking for something not too hard and not too boring which would help me to ease back into exercises, yet challenging. After two times of doing it (from the beginning to end), I started to fast forward aerobics (cardio) section, since it was too boring and I didn't feel any effect. I liked other sections (sculpting) though and explanations on how to perform movements correctly to avoid injuries and for more effectiveness.My mother-in-law (she is 52) laughed at the hairdos of participating actors.Overall, I regret of buying it. I think it's just a loss of money and time, since you will need something else to compliment this workout to get any effect, so it's not ""comlete"" at all. Two times was it for me, I put it away and don't think will ever watch it again."
2,Maybe if I were coordinated....,"I find it very hard to get a good aerobic workout with this tape because I'm always kind of lost and stumbling with the steps. Also, I have a small living room and the routines take up a lot of front/back and side to side space."
3,SOOO FUNN!!,"ooh i love the cardio part of this video! its just soo fun, and even if you really really dont feel like working out, the 35 min will fly by so fast! its fast paced and you dont repeat any of the moves too many times, so you have no time to get bored.however, i only gave it 3 stars because i dont like the weight and leg section. it was too slow and boring and the moves are not fresh: they are just plain moves you see everywhere (lunges, bicep curls..)"
2,Poor Quality Video - Disappointing,"The quality of this video is quite poor. The light levels or contrast are so high that the images are not sharp. I guess I could adjust my television settings, but I don't think in this day and age with technology as advanced as it is, that I should have to do that just to get it right!"
2,Jane Fonda Complete Workout,"The workout itself is not bad, but I prefer the step aerobic tape. This one has too many segments so that you have to rewind and forward for different ones. If it were on DVD it would be fine."
2,Very disappointed,"I, too, bought this book based on recommendations for the original that is now out of print. I found many typos, especially in the last 50 pages of the book. It's as though the publisher didn't even use a spell check! I also found several contradictions in their own facts, dates that were confused etc.I liked the layout and I believe there are several subjects that are addressed well, but I would suggest that any homeschooling parent read ahead in order to omit the discrepancies found."
3,I disagree--this is not as good as the original.,"We homeschool, also, and ordered this 'red book' when we couldnot find the other. We were most disappointed with it...[I was ableto locate] leftover copies of the original... I bought two of those. We are glad and have never missed the red book. I have a copy of the 'red book' in my classroom where I teach and the kids are not drawn to it as I had hoped they would be. I also have the red science encyclopedia, and the kids like that one. I find the red history book is too cluttered, too vague in the sequence of happenings, and we dislike the manner in which the timeline is presented..."
3,Some obvious mistakes,"Book contains some obvious mistakes. On page 113 it is stated that Rurik was the founder of Kiev, what is not true, because Kiev had been known since V century."
2,Disappointing,"Beware -- this is not the update to the highly regarded Kingfisher Illustrated History. Instead, it reformats the previous work, departing from the orderly 'accent of western civilization' theme, de-emhasizing Greek and Roman history in favour of lesser known, minor world cultures and in general, adds aggresive PC editing. Using this book as a homeschool reference will result in you needing to spend time explaining the PC biases to your children, and ultimately, needing to purchase an additional reference book."
2,Great pictures.... could pass on the text,"I'm just using this to complement ""Story of the World"". As an exciting pictorial reference book it's useful but maybe not as a stand alone curriculum."
1,Poor Work,"This is a poor work for all of the reasons stated. The facts are especially weak with regard to the African kingdoms and empires. The Ghana kingdom, for example, was never ruled by berbers and neither was it dependent upon them for trade. It was founded and ruled by the Soninke, a part of the Mande group which for over 1000 years dominated the trade routes North, East, and South of their capitals. The book also continues to pay too much lip-service to Greeks and Romans and their influence on Western society and not enough to the cultures most influential outside of Europe. There is a much larger world beyond the West, and any book about ""HISTORY"" should explore - honestly - every aspect of that world. It is therefore a poor homeschool reference, because it will result in you needing to spend time explaining eurocentric biases to your children, and ultimately, needing to purchase an additional reference book."
1,Disappointing Revision,"While this version is intially attractive, I found it a disappointing replacement of the original. In addition to the already stated objections, it has a stronger anti-Christian or politically correct viewpoint than the original. In fact, certain opposing theologies were stated to the point of factuality that my friend insisted on the book being removed from her home without wishing to resell it for fear of harmful influence."
3,OK,"This book is OK but then again I'm only twelve.I would probebly give it 4 if I was an adult. I don't like History very much, but this is one exeption. I use it at schooland read it just for fun. It really is a great book. But remember, I hate history."
2,"Disappointing text, good pictures","This book is a world history organized by time. So, the page after ancient greek history is the Shang Dynasty in China. THis could have been a very powerful approach, if the selections had been better organized and had better lead-ins to subsequent pages. But instead it is almost confusing and definitely hard to use as a page-turner for an interested kid. It is easier to progress from ancient greek history to classical greek history than from ancient greek history to chinese history.Having said that, the pictures are satisfactory and generate interest in my 6 yr old. So, if you receive this as a gift, don't toss it out. But don't purchase it either."
4,Handy for Kids in Classical Schools,My headline says it all really. It is a great additional resource for grammar school history projects -- which my three daughters do every year.
3,Conflicted on how to review this book,"The Kingfisher History Encyclopedia:We use the Kingfisher as part of our Story of the World History text.Many of the reviews posted have mentioned that the book is very, very brief in each of the historical eras that it presents. I would agree that it is very limited, I don't know if I would have purchased it after using it for half the year. It seams that when i want to expand the reading on an era I prefer to reach for the borrowed library books, online resources or an actual encyclopedia than the kingfisher. The illustrations are good and it does give me ideas for online research but its just not something I am going to be using very much."
4,Kingfisher History Enclyclopedia,"A good buy for us! We bought this to supplement the series: The Story of the World by Susan Bauer. It is easy to ready, plenty of pictures and TONs of information."
1,Emily Dickinson's Poetry is altered by the editor,"I am a big fan of Emily Dickinson, I love her poetry, but this edition is thoroughly rotten. It is not Emily Dickinson's poetry, but the edited version of her poetry, significantly changed by the same editor who rejected Dickinson's poems while she was alive. This edition is changed so much from the original poems that most of Dickinson's meaning is lost. If you want to read what Emily Dickinson really wrote, I reccomed the complete poetry of Emily Dickinson edited by Thomas H. Johnson, it is the complete and original poetry of Dickinson."
1,What was Higginson Thinking?,"I would like to know what Higginson was thinking when he obliterated Emily's poetry. He actaully had the arrogance to think that he knew what she 'intended' to write. This is an absolute farce of a book. Compare the hacked and pieced poems in this 'book' <and I use the term loosely> to the ones you find in 'The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinson' edited by Thomas H. Johnson. That is the book to get. Johnson was part of the team that maticulously read her hand-written versions and published a word for word, dash for dash version. If you want to read what the genious Emily originally wrote seek the REAL works, not this attrocious adaptation! The print speaks for itself."
1,Warning,"This book may be interesting to experts who want to see how the first ""editors"" Todd and Higginson, alterated Dickinson's poems, ""by smoothing out the rhymes and meter, changing line arrangements, and rewriting the dialect of the local area"", as the introduction plainly states.Is it naivety, stupidity or cold deliberation that this book is still sold under the innocent title of ""collected poems"", as if it presented the original texts? It should come with a warning."
5,great,"Here we have somebody on a different path, but on a similar level to Robert Johnson or Skip James. An important link in the chain, and these recordings do him justice. Not an easy listen, given his harsh, demanding, insistent voice, and hard not to feel furious at how he was treated, how he lived his life, and died. The tale of how he was blinded, as a child, by his stepmother throwing lye in his eyes when he saw her with another man is from a Greek tragedy. Elemental, it passes a shiver up your spine"
5,Blues Gospel (almost) at its best,"Okay, I will grant Blind Willie Johnson the title of best slide guitar gospel blues if I get to reserve best 12-string guitar gospel blues for Rev. Gary Davis. I particularly like his rendition of Let Your Light Shine On Me although I don't expect it to be the favorite cut of most listeners. The female voice(s) backing him - read the notes for the wives disputes - are very well attuned to Blind Willie's work and are a wonderful addition. His solo work is, however, just as powerful. Perhaps Motherless Children Have a Hard Time would be a more generally accepted top cut. As with any ""complete records"" there is a mixture in the quality both of the music and of the recording; but none of the cuts are belong on the editting room floor - a significant credit to the overall quality of his work."
5,Essential for Anyone Interested in Gospel or Blues,"This album is required listening for anyone who is a practitioner of slide guitar or an aficionado of early twentieth-century gospel or blues music. Blind Willie Johnson was simply the best, and a previous review here is blasphemous for saying that his music sounds like Popeye and Olive Oyl in duet. There is no music that makes me more exited than Blind Willie Johnson's ""Complete Recordings,"" including that of Robert Johnson, Son House, or Willie McTell. Mr. Johnson could turn a Nietzschean into a Christian. His technical facility on his instrument, combined with his strong lyrical themes, make the songs on this album timeless. This is the real ""unplugged."" Buy it now."
4,Popeye and Olive With Incredible Slide,"Listening to this at first, it really does sound like Popeye and Olive Oyl dueting. Then after a few listens, things grab hold. Johnson has one of the most terrifying voices ever, one that evokes the wrath of the inner soul rebelling against an unjust world. the only thing stopping this collection from 5 stars is a rocky stretch of singles in mid-career, most of them unpassionate covers (like Sweeter as the Years Go By). But it is hard to be unmoved by the heart-rending Nobody's Fault but Mine or Everybody Oughta Treat a Stranger Right. I think the shorter recently released collection may be a better place to start."
2,Why all the fuss??,"I've been a blues fan for about 40 years. Have listened to a lot of blues over the years on vinyl, cassettes, dvds, and radio. I know we're all supposed to worship Blind Willie. It's one of the rules of being a blues fan - like having to refer to Charlie Chaplin as a genius of film comedy. But I just don't get it. Granted he does some very nice slide guitar work. But that cheese-grater-on-the-vocal-chords voice is painful to listen to! Combine that with the often unintelligible lyrics and repetitive repertoire, and you've got, for my money, a just about ""unlistenable"" package. Try sitting thru a back-to-back listening session of these two CD's. You'll be screaming for ""moycy""!! I know NASA sent Blind Willie's music out into space. Just wish it had been my CD set that they put on the Voyager."
1,unimaginably hard to listen to,"I don't even know where to begin, but this was without a doubt the worst CD I ever bought. I own over 100 blues CD's of various artists A to Z, and this one is the only one I wanted to throw in the trash before I even got through with it. You can not even get to hear the guitar because this mans voice is just absolutely aggravating. I can't even describe it. Is it screaming? But to tell you how I feel, I would rather listen to a jackhammer, or fog horn, going off repeatedly in my living room before I would ever play this CD again. I have to admit, I am no authority here, and I could be quite wrong about this CD, but take my advice for what its worth. And definitely buy something else."
1,Same OLD Joey,"Joey's tenacity in the face of adversity is commendable. I did not enjoy reading about it, though. I took his advice...one day at a time? One page, a day at a time."
4,And The Stories Just Keep On Coming,"THIS IS A NOTE ON MY JACK RAYMOND REVIEW. THERE IS AN ""I"" missing in the last paragraph after the word ""like""! Please correct it if you can.thanks Jack Raymond"
5,"Man as Art, a visual feast",Man as Art is a stunning pictorial essay of face painting in Papua New Guinea. It's coffee table size format and razor sharp photographic resolution make the pictures breathtaking. The colors are vibrant and the lighting is outstanding.
5,Fabulous book.,"This book pushed my intrigue over the edge to the point where I had to go see for myself.The photos are great, I've studied each one for hours and couldn't wait to make my own trip toPapua New Guinea to meet these incredible people. Believe me, this book was the portal into alife changing trip."
3,Convenient packs,"My son has been eating the Serendipity 3 Frozen Hot Chocolate and loves it, but the size is too large for him so I bought these due to the single serving size. However, although they arrived quickly, he did not like the taste as much so if you are considering this purchase you might want to do your own comparison."
2,Misadvertising,"I ordered what I thought was an adult sweatshirt, and to my surprise it was a youth size. No where in the description did it indicate it was a child size. Had to quickly order something else as a gift."
2,Wrong item!,I obtained 2 different Suns sweatshirts. They came from different companies. I received them both quickly but this one was the wrong thing. It was pants instead. I emailed them and they responded quickly and said they would send the correct thing. I mailed the pants back which cost me as I had opened the package. They did send another sweatshirt but instead of a large adult I received a large youth. It was too late to return it and get another to my parents out of state so I kept it and gave it to my daughter. I am sure they would have corrected it again but I had no time to do get it done before Christmas.
5,The Blonde Bombshell strikes back...,"If you know Crystal Lewis then you know this is good. 'Nuff said. If not, however, you should go out and buy everything she's ever done. Now.Looks, voice, wordplay--she's got it all.Fearless: 10/10"
5,What a Great way to praise the LORD!,I enjoy this CD very much and I think you all out there will too! Crystal puts so much heart into what she is singing.She sounds like she means what she is saying.This CD will rise your spirits with it's music.It is an enjoyable way to praise your GOD! Remember there is only one man who takes care of us and thats GOD and what a great way to praise his work!
3,The Voice,"Crystal has the kind of voice ... It's taken several spins for me to like this project as a CD. Right now it is background music as i work my job. Not because it's a bad CD, but some of her earlier projects spoke to me a little faster.But then Crystal has that kind of voice -- like Brandy or Monica -- where you just love the voice and don't really care about concentrating on the lyrics; a soothing, comforting voice. Fortunately she's singing Godly messages. I just wish that I could get her episodes of the former NICK show, ""Roundhouse"" on DVD.Highligts: remix of Only Fools, I Still Belive w Kirk FranklinTruSoulDJ"
5,"""Here am I. Send me!""","Do you think of yourself as being on mission? Do you look for evidence that God has placed you where you are to be part of His kingdom work? ""Fearless"" is -to me- a timeless reminder that as God knows us completely, inside and out, it is in our best interests to be honest with ourselves. Crystal Lewis' honest, God fearing heart is revealed and we may benefit from her mission in music. Listen and try to deny that some part of you isn't found in the words she sings. Her passion and the source of her strength invites us to submit to the same Source. Enjoy, be encouraged and give thanks for God's gift of music found so powerfully free and on mission in Crystal Lewis' ""Fearless""."
4,FEARLESS AND FUNKY FOR YA!,"I really enjoy this album because Crystal is not afraid to strech out and experiment with different genres of music.The first track REACH OUT is a trip-hop, alternative sounding track and Crystal's voice gives it a really ethereal sound to it.The next track SATISFIED is very r&b and a little disco as well.You will definitely want to get up and move to it.The Kirk Franklin produced I STILL BELIEVE is really pleasant to listen to and has a kind of contemporary ""anthem"" sound to it.I always likened Lewis to being the ""Teena Marie"" of contemporary christian music because she has such a soulful and earthy quality to her voice.She is not trying to sound urban which some singers in this genre do sometimes and she keeps real and holy.This cd is worth the money."
2,Mistitled and misleading,"I was looking for a guide on Glacier National Park. This book enticed me by its title. Insiders' guide to Glacier National Park, however it should be renamed: Insiders guide to the Flathead Valley and one chapter on Glacier National Park. If you're interested in finding waterslide parks for the kids, 100 miles from the park entrance, this book is for you. If you're like me and would like a good book about exploring the national park itself, find another book."
4,The Insider's Guide to Glacier - 1st Edition,"If you're planning a trip to northwest Montana, this is the book to buy! This became my bible planning my family's vacation, and included all the information I needed including accommodations, activities for kids, area events and recreation. The book includes a history of each area,which I found of special interest. It made planning my trip so easy to do...I highly recommend it!"
2,Chamber of Commerce approach,"I also found this book to be poorly organized. Every restaurant, lodging, attraction, etc. is ""fantastic"". With no critique whatsoever, one would think this book is written by the local chamber of Commerces. Almost worthless without this information."
1,Worthless,This book is worthless. I have spent 2 months combing this book trying to find something to help plan our trip. I finally went out and bought Frommer's Guide to Montana and Wyoming and it gave me all the information I was looking for in 1 chapter. It answered all my questions with ease. This Insidier's Guide did not even have trail names listed. The Montana/Wyoming 2-state book with several national parks covered had all the trail names of GNP listed. This book should be taken off the shelves!!!
2,Relocating to Glacier,"This book provides a great review of the Glacier Area - if you are interested in Moving there. It even dedicates an entire chapter to relocation. It does provide an interesting list of area museums, curiosities and accomodations. The author includes narratives on local history and wildlife. However, there is no information on trails and hiking. This is a good overall book if you do not plan on leaving your car and are planning to see the area including numerous local towns. I returned this book and plan to purchase other guides with provide more practical information on what the park offers."
3,Monkey can't monkey around!,"I got this set mainly for the geared motor, which is verygood. But I decided to build a couple models anyway. Ibuilt the monkey, and although I didn't try it on the stringit seemed too heavy and off balance to work. So I built aspider and the motor just made it flop back and forth. Itkept coming apart. What good is that? My only reccomendationfor this set is the motor, so you can use it on other technic sets."
1,Far too expensive,"A simple search finds this product at nearly 40% less expensive than with Amazon. I have come to rely upon Amazon as the ""go to"" place to find the best bargains and I am disappointed. This is something I take daily and 40% makes a difference."
5,Top Notch Playing & Production,"What more can you ask. From blues to jump, this CD simply shines. Hill's guitar playing has all the taste & tone your ears could desire. Fans of Duke Robillard will find this one a perfect addition to their collection."
2,"Warning: documentary ABOUT the specials, not the actual specials","I thought I was purchasing a DVD of Mitzi Gaynor TV specials. She made 9, so minus ads that's about 7 hours of content. Instead, I got a 2-hour documentary *about* the Mitzi Gaynor specials: brief glimpses of what I thought I was purchasing intercut with interviews with a late-life Gaynor and other participants and fans.The documentary was okay, but the price is quite expensive compared to other documentaries of comparable quality and length. Rereading the DVD box, I do find the word ""documentary"" buried on the back cover, but it does not appear on the front of the product - not even in small print! I am left feeling somewhat misled and gypped, and will be very hesitant to purchase anything from City Lights Media in the future."
5,"Razzle Dazzle, Zest Boom Bah!","What beautiful memories Mitzie Gaynor brings back of the golden era of the Dance Musical, and to think she's still performing to this day. We wish her continued success for the present and the future. Ah! The good ol' daze!"
1,brainless copy and paste,"This book is just a big bundle of copy&paste;, that's all.For example, in the ""security architecture and design components and principles"" section, the authors explained that the three basic components are CPU (microprocessors), storage, and peripherals (scanners, printers, modems). How is that relevant to SECURITY architecture designs? That's some seriously brainless copy & paste!"
2,Only buy if you have a lot of spare time,"This book is overly detailed, and not a good crunch guide. If you understand security concepts, your best bet is the Passport guide to the CISSP. It's an easy read, and provides the perfect amount of detail so you can pass the test with minimal studying time."
3,Very in depth but very dry,"A very good in depth guide, but very dry and hard to read as a result. I recommend the Shon Harris book in lieu of this as it will keep your attention much longer."
2,Worst Book I Ever Wasted my Money On,"This is by far the worst book I ever wasted my money on! I bought this book thinking that the ""official"" in the title meant all the facts are there and is readable. Well, all the facts are there but it certainly is not readable! Even for a technically capable person like me (BS & MS EE, PHD candidate at a top engineering school) my brain would wonder and spin each time I attempted to read this book. It is so full of repetitive jargons and very ""extended"" sentences that make you lose track of the information the author is try to convey. It appears most of the sentences were paraphrased from multiple sources and hence there is no coherence between the paragraphs. It is incredibly bad. If you don't trust me, buy it. Any other book is better! I had to buy another book."
4,On the Road to the CISSP Exam.,The book is well informative and gives alot of good insight to what a person needs to know in order to have a chance on passing the CISSP test. Happy Trails!
2,Poorly Illustrated. Better quality was expected,"After months of wait, finally book is in the market.I was expecting better presentation and ultimate reference from ISC2. I was really disappointed. Even than it is a must have book because it ""Official"" guide. However, don't just focus on this one, it is too verbose but still as its is ""official"" you have to read it. Look for other resources like ""CISSP Study Guide in SimpleFAQs"" by PacificIS, "" CISSP All-in-One Exam Guide"" by Shon Harris and cccure."
2,official ISC2 gide to the CISSP Exam,"As a future CISSP, I found this book very incomplete and difficult to read. I was given this book in a course, however I would not buy it. I expect a 2nd edition to come out next year.I would strongly suggest the Shon Harris book for future CISSP"
5,Best exam prep guide,"I have both this book and Shon Harris' book. Although I liked the Harris book and it was very informative, my advice is that if you are only going to buy one exam guide, buy the (ISC)2 book. It gives you the information in a manner that more closely mirrors the type of questions you will get on the exam. Both books are good though, and both come with a CD that contains practice tests. Another bit of advice: study hard. The exam is a bee-yatch."
5,Great book so far. Errors? What errors?,"I always read the negative reviews to get a better handle on the quality of the book. I become suspicious of negative reviews when people mention errors (which seems to happen to every cert book) but then don't give any examples of them. I'm not finished with the book yet but what I've read so far seems accurate and pretty straight forward. I'm not saying there aren't errors but just that I haven't found any yet. Like any test, you shouldn't rely on just one book to pass it but this book should definitely be on the list of those you read."
5,Good stuff Menard,"This book is crucial for you to pass the exam. It is a very good book. It is also terribly dry. It is like an encyclopedia. It takes a while to get through the book. I've found I can get through 1 or 1.5 chapters on a weekend because it has a lot of information to digest.I have read 1/2 of the book so far and I have not found any errors. It was reviewed by multiple people before being published, so errors are terribly unlikely.You might pass the CISSP test just by reading this book. I found that augmenting this book with the Info. Security Mgmt. Handbook, 5th Ed. (CD-ROM edition) from Auerbach is a really good strategy, but the book is $150-$200 depending if you buy the CD based book or not.Buy the book."
1,Riddled with errors!!,"I was so excited to review this book and am so unbelievably disgusted and saddened. It has so many errors, I am not sure how 3 authors could not have caught them.I pray that the actually CISSP exam does not have so many errors embedded into it if this is the official study guide.I am afraid that people who are not security professionals will learn the wrong information if they study this book."
1,Natural Cure for Sleeping Problems !!!,"This book is very good for those having sleeping problems. It is much more effective than any other cure! Can't get to sleep? Just open this book, read a couple of lines and BINGO. You would be sleeping like a polar bear and snorting like hell. It happens all within just a few seconds! And yet no one can wake you! Like the dead beauty, you know!!!No chemicals, no pills, no miracles, nothing.AS NATURAL AS IT CAN BE !!!"
4,A Review by Daphne Baylor Dean and Kevin Yeoman,"Like most things in life this book had several good and bad aspects. We really enjoyed the diverse topics that the author explored. He wrote in depth on issues ranging from new media technologies, e-commerce, and privacy to hacking, copyright issues and indecencies. All these issues brought about some very thought provoking inquires for us as readers. We also appreciated the book's anti-commercialization stance on cyberspace. In contrast, one major drawback is the means by which the author heavily intertwined legal issues in every chapter of the book. People without a high interest for law may not appreciate the author's expertise in the field of law. Overall, we thought this book would be worth reading for anyone interested in cyberworld issues."
3,"Nice clock, but...","Nice clock. Very nice finish. The tone of the chime is warm and rich. Unfortunately, the hour hand cracked and fell off the clock a few hours after I started it. Very disappointing. The hands are VERY delicate and I wasn't really surprised that it broke once I saw how thin and delicate they were they were."
4,Cuckoo,Beautiful clock with nice sound. Only drawback is that the Cuckoo can't be shut off without stopping the clock. Too loud to sleep with. Note that this clock has a mechanical wind mechanism (the dangling cords) and no electrical needs.
5,This one stands out...,"I've been listening to a lot of blues lately (mainly Skip James - the man's eerily brilliant - and Lightnin' Hopkins - gotta love po' Lightnin') so I picked up this CD to continue the exploration, and I definitely wasn't disappointed. Bukka has a unique style - very loose and loopy but never gets off track - and the washboard in the background has this death-rattling sound that adds to the creepy feel of the lyrics - most of which are about death, or trains, or trains that represent death. Overall, this has a weird feel to it, and you really get a sense that Bukka knew exactly what he was talking about. And ya gotta love a CD that has a reproduction of artist's police mug-shots in the liner notes (Bukka did some jail time for shooting a guy). This is unique, beautiful, and raw. Check it out."
3,Pickin' & Sinnin',"This is fine country blues by an often overlooked master. These are songs of tough times by someone who really knew what he was talking about--jail stories from a man who had spent time on those old rural jails that everyone really had reason to fear. My personal favorite is Parchman Farm Blues, a tune that conveys sadness, maybe even hopelessness, more clearly than most anything I've ever heard."
4,Master of Doblo.,"Together with Son House, Bukka is a master of Doblo. Bukka is not as influential as House but Bukka plays basic and enjoyable blues."
2,Not new,"We were disappointed in this product when it arrived. We were told that there were scratches before we bought it, but we assumed they were from being on display. This was a used product and we weren't awared of that when we paid for it. We kept the product because it is the only one we could find and they don't make this model anymore. The good part is that it was packaged well with no breakage to any of the glass. And all the brackets and screws were enclosed."
5,Carrie Lucas is great!!,"... I just got this cd today, and it's great! I had ""Show Me Where You're Coming From"" on a 45..but the cd disco version is excellent. The whole cd is great! She's got a sound that will never go out of style. If you are a fan of days of remember when and disco, you will like thiscd. ... Her sound stands the test of time. Truly a diva of her time."
4,Strong Ballad Section,"I bought the 1982 LP and now the CD for the beautiful Monty Seward penned ballad, ""Dreamer,"" as well as the other ballads, ""Sweet Love"" and ""Still in Love."" However, the more uptempo songs, especially ""Show Me Where You're Coming From"" and ""Is It a Dream?"" really round off this fine example of the Solar Records sound. Good '80s reminiscing."
3,A Good Buy............but,Sherry's new CD is what her fans have come to expected. Most of the selections are good but Sherry could provide us with more by trying to blend more rap and hip-hop into some selections. This would give the CD a fresher updated sound to attract younger listeners to her music.
4,solid reggae release,"This group has released just a small number of records, but each of them seem to be well written and produced. Jah Works is no exception in this respect. Billy Mystic, the lead vocalist, gives a solid and talented impression on me. I think that this album would satisfy most reggae fans. The songs are varied and the lyrics are much back to the roots. Enjoy!"
1,incorrectly advertised,"This probably isn't a bad product. However, it is incorrectly advertised on here. Contrary to what the information indicates, there are no S-video inputs of any kind on this device. The picture shown is not correct as it also shows S-video connections. I sent mine back recently after receiving it. I see that even though I informed Amazon of this discrepancy they still have not fixed the picture or the description. What's the deal???"
2,Power supply error,"After a year of limited use, the power supply failed. I purchased this from a local retailer. It did work perfectly, for the exact intended purpose while it was opperational, but why buy a device that isn't garenteed to last?"
5,Works Great!!,"Using with an old 19"" Sharp TV, I have had this unit for several months and it has worked great with no problems."
4,Big plus for this camcorder,"The lens arrived promptly. It really made a difference on action and sports shots. The expanded field of view really helps reduce the motion effect on action shots and allows for closer filming of subjects without ""cutting their heads of legs""."
3,Wild Elderberry Tea,I like elderberry tea and this is a good tea to have around. I have enjoyed drinking it. The shipping cost was a little high for me so I probably shall not order from this supplier again.
1,Not actually Elderberry. It's flavored black tea,"I was disappointed when this arrived. The ingredients are ""Ceylon tea"" and natural flavor. All this is is expensive black tea. Save your money and keep looking for real elderberry tea."
3,Weak tea,"The order was shipped very promptly and I have no qualms about recommending the company, however, the tea itself was not the best. It wasn't lousy, just very average."
4,Get Flat,"Not the greatest album of all time but it does have a few stand out songs.Every posse get flat, Rub a dub soilder and the fantastic Pink panther.Worth buying just to here a dub version of the Pink Panther theme, always goes down well at parties."
2,: (,"This story is not your typical coming of age story that we think of when we think of YA literature. I think of stories about teens in the present in situations that I had experienced or knew of people experiencing. Hitch is set during the Great Depression about a boy who has to work full time to survive at the young age of 17. He travels by himself, and joins the Civilian Conservation Corps and his coming of age during this journey. This is an interesting topic for Ingold considering I, nor most young adults I know have never heard of this and most have no interest in it. The book was an easy read with a lot of dialogue to catch the reader's attention but overall I felt it was fairly predictable and the ending was boring."
5,BEAUTIFUL ILLUSTRATIONS,MY GRANDDAUGHTERS AND I HAD A GREAT TIME READING THE INTERNATIONAL STORIES - FINDING AND COUNTING EACH SUBJECT THEN MY DAUGHTER CHIMED AND WE ALL SANG THE SONG AS WE WENT ALONG. A FUN FAMILY TIME!
4,good sophomore effort,"Chaka and Pliers (Chaka Demus and Everton Banner, respectively) are among the new breed of dj/singer combinations in the reggae world, and based on what I can hear, these 2 guys have the chops and goods needed to make it.Chaka's rapping is reminiscent of the newer breed singers, such as Buju Banton and Shaba Ranks, his style somewhat choppy and rough, yet quite enjoyable. Pliers has a basic dj style that allows for Chaka to fill in the blanks and let things flow.Anchored by the smash dance club hit ""Rough This Year,"" (of which I have occasionally spun its 12"" during sets I do) ""Ruff This Year"" is not a sgood an effort as later lps, such as the amazingly tasty ""Tease Me,""or ""Every Kinda People,"" but the grooves are solid, as is the toasting. A fine effort."
2,Derivative Nonsense,"Mild Spoiler Alert.I've learned that anytime Maxim magazine reviewer Pete Hammond or ""Ain't It Cool News"" gives anything a rave, you can bet it's gonna suck. That's the case here. There's nothing satisfying about this film; in fact, I was sorely disappointed that our hapless young'uns aren't slaughtered in outlandishly gruesome ways given that all three male protagonists are reprehensible twits. The only decent character, Yasmine, is last seen running after her friend's car--the driver doesn't bother to rescue his love interest and instead kicks another friend out of the vehicle and takes off to save his own cheatin' butt! (We're supposed to care about these characters?!) Illogical plot, howl-worthy dialogue, and a cross-dressing ""wife"" equal one-and-half hours of your life you'd be better off spending on...well...pretty much anything else."
1,What a stinker.,"Seriously...don't waste your time. I don't think I was scared once in this terrible movie. Total piece of garbage. Can I have my money and the last hour and a half of my life back, please?"
4,GOOD FUN,HELLO SO I AM FRENCH AND I LIKE MOVIES LIKE CALVAIRE HENRY TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE ETC AND WHEN I SAW SHEITAN I LIKED IT A LOT BUT YOU HAVE TO BE WARNED THIS A LITTLE BIT STRANGE AND NOT FOR CHILDREN SO FOR A FRENCH MOVIES IT IS VERY GOOD
1,BORING AND STUPID!,"Another entry in the torture-porn exploitation cinema, except this one contributes nothing new to the genre. Boring, cliché filled, mostly stupid and mediocre Sheitan is a waste of time and money, and the ending, oh! the ending, PATHETIC!Take my advice and AVOID this crappy C- movie."
1,Telling Time--Waste of Time,"It would be a complete waste of time to read ""Telling Time."" Why? Neither it nor the literature discussed is very good. It is about the dregs of prose from the 18th century in England. BOR-RING. It is my opinion that it is the sort of book destined to cause a minor amount of deforestation and then sit on library shelves unread, or read or skimmed by a very few who must read it for professional reasons. It is also my opinion that it is the sort of perfunctory book which professors must write from time to time in order to put the fact of its publication into their Curriculum Vitae."
4,Excellent,I am always on the lookout for books I can share with people that make complicated things easy to understand. I love this series. It is full of good information and easy to process because of the fun and humorous illustrations. I would definitely recommend this one as a primer on Lenin or the pre-Stalin days of the Soviet Union.
5,Circus Train Still a Winner,"This is at least the third circus train Bachmann has offered. This set is smaller (and costs less), but it's a great starter set if you don't mind picking up additional pieces here and there, or if 90% of your display is a circus, and you just want a train to run around it.By the way, ""small"" is relative when you're discussing garden trains. The locomotive and tender (coal car) are about 30"" long all by themselves.The train is pulled by the same upgraded 4-6-0 locomotive that pulls most of Bachmann's starter sets, so you will be pleased with the quality or durability of this set.Paul Race - editor, Family Garden Trains(tm)"
1,Expect to buy a new brand,"I haven't had any problems with this filter *however* it is impossible to find replacement cartridges for the filter. I've searched high and low, locally and on the internet, and all I could find is the measley prefilter cartridge. The actual filter cartridges (there are two) are nowhere to be found. Unless you know the store you buy it from carries the replacement cartridges, save yourself 20 bucks and go with a different brand."
1,Includes some generic crap,It seems whenever a group starts to get long in the tooth they fall back on some special effects and smooth tenor sax. That is all too apparent here. There are some tracks worth listening to but there are also some not worthy of the the past greatness of the Acoustic Alchemy name. I 'm sorry to have seen this happen.
4,Beautiful Game - Beautiful Music,"The Beautiful Game is a breath of fresh air from Acoustic Alchemy. With the passing of Nick Webb we will never have pure Acoustic Alchemy again. So having said that, one should understand comparing this new work with the old may not be wise. This effort from Greg Carmichael and the group does stand on its own two feet- a fine and balanced album. True it does seem somewhat ""mainstream"" and less ""acoustic"" yet I for one am VERY satisfied with the outcome of this recording. I look forward to many more."
2,Not great,"The book itself was in great shape, but did not care for the story line. I expected it to be much better."
5,The most thorough resource!,"I used this book until it was worn and post it marked it ad naseum. 8 months later- I have the job of my dreams. I read several other books (including Pharmrepselect) this one was by far the best and most comprehensive. Reading its companion book (Professional Pharmaceutical Selling) didn't seem to add much insight. I would reccommend David Currier's ""Be Brief, Be Bright, Be Gone"" instead. Put BBB and Insider's Guide together, add your hard work and determination, and you will get there eventually!"
4,Great Book,I really enjoyed reading this book. I thought it was great. Everytime Shemone was happy & gitty about something sweet Darnell did I smiled. Whenever she was irritated about something he did or said I was irritated right with her. I had moments where I couldn't put the book down.Good work Hunter!
2,Very Idealistic,"This book is a good read for young readers or those into hip hop culture. The book is idealistc; however ,it does bring up some good relationship issues as well as awarness to some of the issues African- American women and men face today. This book is a nice read, although it is not for everyone."
3,Okay.,"A pair like no otha is the love story of Shemone and Darnell. When Darnell is released from prison, he and Shemone starts hanging out and start a relationships. Problems soon arise with Darnell not feeling like he is good enough for Shemone, Shemone is a freelance magazine writer who's moving on up. I thought the story was okay, but the relationship moved a little fast for me, also the storyline was kind of boring at times but all in all still and okay read."
2,Hayes is a promising novelist...,"...but for now, she could stand to brush up on some creative writing skills. The storyline in general kept up the momentum, but barely. Too many times, I found myself slamming the book down in disbelief to outright disgust. Some of the situations were realistic enough but were so underdeveloped to the point of being unrealist, but hey, it's fiction, so what did I expect, a more realistic depiction of seemingly realistic situations? Goodness, no. The dialogue was, for the most part, corny; the narration was, at times, confusing, and the story just didn't flow like it should have. I love romance novels like the next person, I've just read better. I thinks Hayes is a promising novelist, but a little more research behind the fiction would make for a better read. That's just one person's opinion."
2,MAKE IT STOP,"You know what? It doesn't get any better.I know, I know. You too were roped in by the awesomeness of The Golden Age and just HAD to see what came next, right? Sure, the first book started to drag a bit before it ended, but that was just because Wright had to fill some pages, right? The awesomeness would return in the middle book, just like the ""Empire Strikes Back,"" right?NO.This book is godawful, terrible bad. This would make Vernor Vinge cringe. It's epically, pompously, annoyingly horrendous. The action is so wordy that you can't follow it. The conversations sound like they were lifted from 1940s B noir. The most compelling plot points are buried in a sea of sloppily constructed speechifying.It gets two stars for being imaginative and for tying up some loose ends of the first book, but make no mistake that I am strongly urging you to avoid this hack job."
4,Better than the First!,"I found the first one slow moving and hard to get through, although that was admittedly because I was in school when I read it and concentrating more on other things. The Golden Age held my attention, however, enough for me to purchase the second book, which I read over Christmas vacation. I have to say that this one held my attention much more, and I found I could barely put it down. It was much more entertaining, I thought, than the first one. The only problem I had with it was Phaethon's condescending attitude. It added dimensionality to the character, but almost went so far as to make him un sympathetic. Daphne quite literally goes to the ends of the earth for him and he treats her like she's some kind of burden, always ignoring her when she's probably the smartest of the bunch. ""No no no honey, space travel is for big strong men only, why don't you run along like a good little girl and clean the house"" -- UGH! SO annoying. Other than that though it was a very good book."
4,this album rocks,"there are some downright dirty and nasty guitar licks here(""I'll never be satisfied""), some serious riffage(track 6, I forget the song name), some humor(""bi""), and some ambience(""nothingness""). This is probably their best work. There is some experimentation with loops, and programming, but that doesn't take away from the hard edge. The last song, ""The Wall"" starts out a normal song, but then gets all chaotic. It's really crazy, but its good stuff."
4,HEAVY,"This is Living Colour's heaviest and darkest album yet. They still manage to work this new sound into an awesome album.It's a shame they broke up. Will Calhoun is a very impressive drummer, Vernon Reid is one of the fastest and most talented guitarists in music, both Muzz Skillings and Doug Wimbish were great on bass, and Corey Glover is one of the most talented vocalists in music.Lucky for us music fans, they recently got back together.Pay special attention to Go Away, Ignorance is Bliss, Auslander, and Nothingness.Enjoy.-PFC"
3,A bit of a letdown.,"All the great characteristics of this band are still evident on this one, but for me, the songs fall a little flat. It doesn't mean that it's still not a good CD, it is. It's just that compared to the first two, the music on ths one is a little stagnent and the experiments don't quite come off as well. Musically, this seems more of a lateral move than a forward one. This still has some great songs on it though, and is still a good addition to any collection. The band broke up shortly after this one came out."
2,Terrible,"Considering that their first two albums were among the best rock albums of the decade (the best, in my opinion), this was a surprise as well as a terrible disappointment. Noise, rage, and despair marred this collection of compositions. At times it sounds like they were tearing their instruments to pieces, if not their very selves. No musical value added by ""Stain."""
5,A REMARKABLE BOOK,"This is truly a remarkable and worthwhile book to read. Reading about these natural laws has given me much greater insight into the workings of these unseen energy forces and how to apply them in my daily life. ""Discovering the natural laws that govern the Universe"" has provided me with another very valuable tool to assist myself and to understand my fellow men. I really recommend it."
5,Wonderful!,Discovering The Natural Laws That Govern The Universe really gave me a clear understanding of how the universe works. This is a book I will turn to again and again for answers to my metaphysical questions.
2,You might want to reconsider purchasing this book,"Recipes are very detailed and can take as much as 2 hours to prepare. The amounts required do not coincide with the amounts in the cans/containers requested. One recipe called for 20 oz of tofu, but tofu comes in 15 oz containers. Do I use more or less? I have cooked for years for 4 people, but my pans are too small for these recipes. However, the stuffed peppers are delicious."
3,Beware of buying this book from Amazon.com,"For those readers interested in health/life-style improvement or information about the CRON diet or Biosphere 2 project, this book offers (in easy-to-understand terms) a plethora of useful information. The majority of the book centers around recipes that support the CRON lifestyle--although many are for 8-servings, might contain ingredients that are a bit hard for the average consumer to find, and even take a good chunk of time to prepare. ..."
4,A valuable addition to your nutrition library.,"An interesting and thought provoking book on the benefits and parameters of calorie restriction. Best read in conjunction with other books on nutrition and biogerontology/aging, especially ""The Zone"" series of books by Dr. Barry Sears. Easy to read, but a little limited in it's perspective."
2,Who Is The only anti-aging guru who has stayed young?,"I tried to learn Caloric Restriction by reading this and other books by Dr. Walford. It did not work! Unless you are unlike 99.99% of the population in how and what you eat, this book will never, never teach you how to do Caloric Restriction!But I learned how to stay young and live longer through The Elixxir Program. It uses Caloric Restriction as its scientific foundation but turns it into something doable, livable, even pleasurable. It is beyond CR, really! This guy Elixxir has been on the program for almost 25 years, much longer than Walford. Elixxir looks much younger than his age! I have seen him up close! (Walford looks older than his age, sad to say.)Read The Immortalist Manifesto, available on Amazon, and you will get excerpt and information about The Elixxir Program at the end.As Marilyn Much of Investors' Business Daily writes ""Elixxir is the only anti-aging guru who has actually stayed young!"""
4,John Reuben's Finest,"I stumbled across this CD by accident when it first came out, when he was largely unheralded. I was very pleasantly surprised by how solid this was, with ""Divine Inspiration"" still one of my favorite songs in the Gospel rap genre. Unfortunately, all of John's subsequent offerings strayed from the most excellent roots in this album which are what made him so popular in the first place.If you are a fan of Hindsight, then you actually might not like this album much at all (and vice versa)."
5,yeah!,"This is the best Reuben album. In my opinion, his music started out great with this CD, but went pretty much downhill from there. Actually, I stopped buying them after Professional Rapper, which was only OK, and I really regretted that because I had a lot of respect for him after his first and second. Bring it back to HERE, man!"
5,John Reuben- Unusual but he rocks!,"Unfortunately, ""Are we There Yet"" is the only John Reuben CD I own, but it stinkin' rocks. Its really hard to decide on a favorite song...and when a CD does that to you...its a good sign. My three favorite are ""Divine Inspiration"", ""Him, Her, He or She"", and ""Ego"". They are so... I don't know... exciting and snappy they just rock. And you can totally tell then John Reuben is a Christian artist, because he never says anything rude or crass and, though some of his music might lean towards a hint of self praise, he still rocks... in short I guess I'm trying to say he is the best Christian rapper in the business... and he could kick Eminem's butt anyday."
5,I am so thankful for this video,"My 7 yr. old son has recently been diagnosed with this syndrome. I was trying to explain it to my family. This video made it so much easier. I gave them the video and they were able to see for themselves. It is so well-explained and I liked the Dr.s (the cup is half full attitude). I recommend this video to anyone who has a friend, student, or family member with this syndrome."
4,"Easy to Install, provides decent visual deterent","Got this product 2 days after I ordered it, not bad. I read a bunch of reviews before installing thes films on my windows and heeded the advice to make sure I first cleaned the window really well and then had plenty of water (with a little bit of liquid soap) on the window when I put it up. It was a snap to put on the window and I easily did it by myself. Once on the window, the bubbles were easy to get out with the included ""squeegy"". Provides enough visual deterent where someone on the other side of the window would only be able to see very blurry figures inside as this still allows the light in quite well.1 Word of caution, do not get the paper backing on the film wet before removing from film as it will adhere to the film and is a real pain to get off. I had a tinie little drop on one spot and it took me a little elbow grease just to get that little spot of transferred paper off the film, I'm thankful it was only a very small spot!"
4,Nice,Shipping was slow but the item was great.This film is beautifully textured and it's really easy to apply.It would've been better if it was more blurry though. I had to apply two layers.
1,bubbles,"lots of bubbles, despite repeated attempts to reapply.I have followed the instruction to apply several times and air bubbles were hard to remove.difficult to apply."
1,Beware before you buy,"I bought this watch thinking that Invicta made premium high-end watches. I am very disappointed as my watch just died after about 15 mos. The watch was lightly used and basically pampered, appearing brand new. My emphasis is on the fact that the watch was in no way abused. I then sent the watch back to Invicta for repairs and they wanted $48 to fix it, including a rip-off price of $28 for S & H. The representative I dealt with, on top of it, was unyielding, blunt and unapologetic. They furthermore refused any type of extended warranty if I consented to fix the watch. There's no way I'm going to invest about half of the watch's purchase price to fix it just to have it die again after minimal use. I consider this watch and brand to be junk and think that if you want reliability, don't buy it. I've had better luck with so-called cheap brands like Guess and Casio. If you buy one, don't say you weren't warned."
5,Solid watch,"This is a fine watch. I bought it for my father last christmas, 12 months ago. It has held up well dispite the fact he normally punishes his watches. I have a real rolex GMT II and it is really hard to tell the difference unless you really know your stuff and are very close to the watches. Great look for a fraction of the cost. He liked it so much he bought another all-gold looking invista witht he same general look."
4,Good watch for the price,"This was my first invicta watch and I was intrigued by its similarity to much more expensive watches. Overall great watch, nice and heavey, looks great. The only downside is that the gold on the bottom links has begun to rub off within the first week of owning it. Other than that I've gotten a lot of compliments on it."
1,not a good crime book,"I love crime books. I've read hunderds of them. This one, just might be the worst I've read in years. The story is just so shallow, the characters are so flat, and the ending totally predictable. I really can't recommend this book to anyone."
1,This story deserves a better writer,"I too followed this story when it broke, and then on Court-TV, and looked forward to the book that would surely result from this case. But this wasn't it. The book jacket says the author is a veteran journalist, but at times he writes like a high school student. I could hardly believe it when I read this (p. 58 of the hard cover edition): ""Mark inserted the key into the ignition, put the car into reverse, then into drive as he crept across the smooth asphalt surface of the parking lot."" There's too much filler like this in the book. There's also way too much in this book about what Mark Hacking was supposedly thinking - and since the author didn't interview him, who knows what he was thinking? And the same goes for his actions immediately following the murder - who knows what he really did?I wish Ann Rule had written this one."
5,more than the newspapers told us...,"I followed this case in the magazines and newspapers, and bought the book because it was such a sad and extraordinary case. As always in these types of books, there is new information that I didn't know before (especially the last paragraphs....) Mark Hacking is probably the dumbest of all criminals I have read about -- and I've read about a lot of them. The things he did are just beyond comprehension, not only the murder itself, but his alibi and cover-up were stupid. In any case, he is locked up forever, hopefully. Lori trusted an untrustworthy man, to say the least. But then, maybe that's why they call sociopaths the killer's next door -- they live among us, but no one suspects anything until it's too late."
5,very good book,This was a very good book. It was a little hard for me to get into but after that it was excellent.
1,"Stay away from this book, A lot of lies",This book should be sold as fiction. It is one of the worst written and most inaccurate books on the Mormon religion I have ever read. Do not buy this book.
1,Sensational and salicious,"I threw the book in the trash after skimming it for about an hour. For some reason, the author believes that the Mormon faith played an integral role in Lori's murder...that if Mark Hacking were not a Mormon, he wouldn't have killed his wife (I wonder, if Mark had been a member of some other religion, would religion have even been mentioned in the book?). Major portions of the book are filled with lies and half-truths about the Mormon church used, I'm sure, to create an even more sensational story (the author himself, in the foreword, admits he gathered his information on the Mormon church from disaffected former members. So much for journalistic honesty). There was also the inclusion of very sacred ceremonies and symbols from the Mormon faith that served no purpose to the story whatever...except to create controversy. Sadly, I guess we all know controversy sells books, even poorly written books like this one."
3,Nothing Is As It Seems On the Surface.,"There is no such thing as a fairytale marriage. For a fairytale romance, see the new movie, 'The Lake House.' And the word 'perfect' should be taken out of the dictionary. No one is perfect. She thought he was and trusted him for six years, only to discover that he was a compulsive liar. She'd dubbed him 'Mr. Perfect.' But he led her straight into a real life nightmare. Karl kept the trouble brewing, or was it Joe Allen who did the dirty work?To so-called friends, they were the 'perfect' couple, so in love, but that was only false appearances. When she uncovers the truth of the matter, she becomes covered in trash as he falsely said she had disappeared. He always lied. This time, however, it was a major issue and he was the number one suspect. Poor Lori, she was disposable when she knew the truth.Written by the author of OUT OF CONTROL, it details the findings of the corpse and the police case against the perpetrator, the 'perfect' husband."
1,OH BROTHER !,"THIS IS SINGULARLY THE WORST TRUE CRIME BOOK I'VE EVER READ. IT'S NOT EVEN A CRIME BOOK, IT'S AN ANTI-MORMON DIATRIBE AND IT'S JUST PLAIN SOPHOMORIC. AS A FORMER THERAPIST AND POLICE OFFICER I WILL SAY THIS, MARK HACKING WAS A TEXTBOOK PSYCHOPATH, BE HE LDS, BAPTIST, CATHOLIC OR DRUID AND RELIGION HAD NOT ONE IOTA TO DO WITH THE MURDER. THE AUTHOR EVEN ADMITS HIS BIAS. WAIT FOR SOMETHING BETTER TO COME OUT, THIS IS JUST JUNK."
2,Every's Woman's Nightmare,I so wanted to like this book as I had a great interest in this case and it's Mormon perspective. Unfortunately many facts were glossed over and it seemed glib. There was no real character development. I wouldn't recommend it unless you are looking for a very fundamental view of this highly publicized murder.
3,every woman's nightmare,"The story was engaging and interesting, but not enough detail. I would have liked to see more on how she discovered his lies and I also understand she had a close male friend. this was not mentioned."
2,It's Mormons not Mormans,"Just tell the story without all the made up religious storytelling.I know it makes for a more interesting read but when one has been a member over 45 years it becomes very distracting to read all the negative, fabricated, salacious and skewed details. Mormonism really isn't that wacko...sorry to disappoint you. Other than that I didn't find any new details."
2,Disappointing,"I remember this case very well from several years ago, so I was very excited to read this book, as a true-crime buff. However, this book was basically a waste of time. I didn't learn anything new from this book that I couldn't have learned from googling the case. I was looking more of an Ann Rule-esque type of book, with more background on Lori and Mark. What I really wanted to learn more about was how Mark got away this his lies for so long and how Lori really felt when she found out (did she confide in any close friends when she found out he wasn't going to med school?), but the author didn't interview any close friends or family, save Lori's brother."
2,"Interesting story, so so book","This book was written about the next case of a missing pregnant wife after Scott Peterson and the subject was interesting enough that I kept reading this book. It is a little simplistic as well as it seemed like the author was grasping for material. For example, there is a whole section about the Hacking's cat. Either way, it was an okay read. Feel very sorry for her whole family."
1,for lori hacking...,not the page turner i was hoping for....i feel for lori and her family-and hope mark rots in hell for what he did to her/familybut this story--needs another writer to write it!!
2,Not the same being a reporter than writing a book,Albeit before reading this book you'll know who was the killer. The problem with SL is that he wrote the mistakes done by the killer in the first part of the book. So the only quasi thrilling part was how they found the body and even that part isn't such a thrilling part. I also agree with others reviewers that the Mormon explanation at every part of the book is just excessive and boring.
1,What a waste of time & Money,"While I was hoping for some insight into the murder of Lori Hacking, all I read was what Mark might have been thinking. Apparently this is easier than doing research. Like the other readers, I was very disappointed in the book."
2,"So many pages, So little insight","Amazingly, the book barely touches on the most interesting part of this story - the lies told by Mark Hacking. It's obvious the author had no direct interviews with either family, because there's little insight gleaned by the time you finish the book. It was a quick read, and some interesting facts were revealed, but this book is simply a collection of facts about the case.It's also repetitive - the author makes the same point over and over again, I guess for lack of anything insightful to say. The author also spends a lot of time on ""filler"" information - talking about all the different defense attorneys in town, the professional background of the judge, the climate, the scenic landscapes - if the book was whittled down to interesting, relevant information about this couple, it would be half as long."
4,Lego Record & Play,"Lego makes great toys for kids of all ages, and this one is really no exception. My son got this for his 7th birthday, and although it may be a little advanced for a 7 year old alone, it's a great way for us to spend a couple of hours together. My only complaint would be for it to have more detailed instructions."
5,Impressive any occasion gift!,"My family refers to this Orefors Discus votive as the ""Crystal Flying Saucer"". It is clear, clean, sparkly and makes a great any occasion gift. I have used it as a wedding shower gift, a thank you gift, etc. It is suitable for teens as well as older folks. The beauty is in its simplicity. Very impressive and costwise!"
1,Another Way to Cover Their Shameful Truth,"This book is another way for them to lie to the world about their shameful truth.. Free Masonry is filled up with crimes and under-table business. In fact, that's what it is... and that's it.!"
5,Excellent Book!,"This book helped me to overcome some hangups that I needed to let go! Excellent reading! The exercises may be a bit hard to remember to do unless your write them down. Otherwise, it is funny, realistic and straight forward."
1,Worst,"This is a big rip off! A few pages of nicely colored, elaborate fonts and nothing more than a few trite messages! Don't waste your money!"
2,Generic Psycho-Spiritual Babble,Blends Freudian psychology with pop Buddhism using vague language and empty metaphors to create an impractical guide devoid of meaning or depth.
2,Nothing new or different,"Another self-help book to give you a transient adrenaline rush and a momentary ""I feel better."" Good stress reliever but so is yoga. Still, this is cheaper than yoga"
2,Where's are the rest of the songs!,"When I bought this I thought it would, more or less, have all the songs that where in the movie. Much to my surprise it only had the music that was composed for the movie. Which was actually quite good, but totalled about 30 minutes. And where are all the other pieces that were in the movie? :("
5,Good Tunin',"I really took the time to listen to the songs on this soundtrack. There are some CD's where people will buy the CD for one or two songs and stay in that vicinity. To be honest, I used to do that as well. I really liked this CD though. After seeing the movie (which was awesome) I wanted to know about the songs. Amazon.com helped me find this soundtrack and I love the songs. Very nice rhythms that matched the movie."
4,Could Someone Plz Tell what's the song that is played @ the end of the movies,"I've been searching for it for along time now, if anyone knows it, plz do tell me.....the song in the end of the movie with the charismatic man singin. well,he's talking......."
5,Good overview of DEN and the major players,"This is the first book I see on the subject. Although it provides a great overview of DEN and major players, the technology is still too new and very shake at the moment. Of course, I can't blame the author, which I'm sure, had to rely on RFCs and white papers. As long as readers have that perspective in mind, the book is worth reading."
1,Want to know about DEN? Don't bother with this book!!,"I was very disappointed with this book. I try to reserve judgement on books until I've read at least 50 pages. However, when I reached page 50 and the author stated ""Although I still am not sure how CIM (and DEN for that matter) will affect network and systems management ..."", I gave up. If the author doesn't know how DEN will affect network and systems management, then why is he writing a book? This is the whole reason I bought the book. Oh well ... $$$ down the tubes."
4,"Older Cirque, but still great","I don't agree that La Magie Continue is boring. There are a couple of acts that didn't hold my interest, but most of the acts were very entertaining. One of the differences between this and the other shows is the lack of a storyline or theme. This is more a succession of acts that are not always connected by a bigger picture (like Quidam or Varekai). In spite of this it was still fun to watch. My favorite act is the clown conducter. Whoever that guy is, he has the most expressive face and it really adds to his performance."
3,It is not a Circus DVD for kids,"If you are not familiar with the Cirque, be aware this is not a DVD about a standard circus that will make happy a 5 years old boy/girl. This is for more mature audiences. It is a piece of art, but not appealing for everyone. It is a mix of theather, circus and state of the art street performances. This is nota David Blaine or David Copperfield DVD! Not for young kids."
3,seth green kicks!!,"Seth Green is my favorite actor, period. This movie is ok, but the shootout at the finale feels dumb but its uplifted by its striking sorta ""The Usual Suspects"" ending, which I liked in this movie. Green sorta dissapeared for like god knows how many minutes making people think hes dead but then comes back, great performance by him, in a geeky way. a must see for Green fans"
5,Do yourself a favor,There are some great songs on this album. I really like this album-For REAL. No songs that have to grow on you.Check it out.
3,so-so,"Once attached to the wall, this paper towel holder doesn't work as well as I'd hoped. The part where one sheet is threaded through (to dispense just one towel at a time and make it easy to tear off) doesn't stay threaded - the towel usually tears off behind that part. Also, pulling on the towels kinda shakes the whole unit a bit - being a little noisy and probably hard on the wall as well.You should also note (as I discovered too late) that the holder only loads from one side, therefore I wasn't able to place it in the same location over the sink to the side in matching restrooms or I wouldn't be able to get the roll on and off once it was hung."
4,NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART,"Like the first season of ""Little Britain"". Season Two is not for prudes or the ""faint hearted"". Matt Lucas and David Walliams are at their zanies and hysterical best. Writing and acting (all major roles; both male and female characterizations) in sketches that are extremely funny boarding on the obscene. I still found this show wildly amusing and would highly recommend to those that are amused with the outrageous.Once again some of the same zany characters are featured and again I still love Vicky Pollard, Marjorie Dawes, and Emily Howard. I also like some of the new characters especially Emily's new unsuccessful transvestite friend Florence with a moustache. This season I love the new character of Bubbles, the penny pinching fat rich dowager that won't pay her bills that thinks she can ""barter' with her body. All in all, it is a most splendid second season. I look forward to more of this series."
2,Same old characters,"I should start by saying that I enjoyed the first season, but even then it was too repetitive. I expected more of the same from the second season, but hoped they'd at least do it with more new characters than existing ones. I have to admit that Daffyd still cracks me up, but most of the original characters have long since grown tired.I did watch the first two episodes of this season in hysterics - the woman at the spa and the jam tasting are especially shocking and hilarious. But once it sunk in that it was going to be the same old stuff over and over again (AGAIN), I was disappointed.There are a few really great moments, and the guys are genuinely funny (Matt Lucas plays women better than any guy I know!) - but there's not nearly enough variety to keep this series fresh."
1,mind numbingly boring repetition,"After seeing the first series, I thought (hoped) that intelligence had started to find it's way back to humor. With the second series, I see that I was wrong. Horribly wrong. In the former, we were introduced to these characters, and with each new scene, a new quirk or tidbit was released to us. In the latter, there is no development at all. It is formulaic. The characters basically do the same thing, again and again, without even much of a change in scenery. Messrs. Walliams and Lucas do not challenge themselves to broaden these individuals in the least, which I find all the more egregious because they have an unerring eye for detail. Perhaps the grind of a series is too much for them. It certainly seems that they have stopped caring. If you like to ""parrot"" characters verbatim, play drinking games by shouting out what's coming next in a scene, or find that you've been attracted to Saturday Night Live post 1979, you might like this. I was acutely disappointed."
1,A Waste of Time,"Maybe if you're a preteen, you'd find this stuff funny but, for the most part, what is presented as humor isn't. It must be the Brits are really starved for laughs since Monty Python left the air if they think this is funny. I'd give it zero stars, if that were an option. Save your money."
5,Love It,"The easily-offended might not enjoy ""Little Britain."" If you like off-center British comedy and aren't easily offended, you'll love it!"
3,Little Tired,"Loved the 1st season, but the laughs come a little harder the second time around. Lou and Andy, Fat Fighters, Emily Howard, Daffyd, Mr. Man, Sebastian, Dennis Waterman, Kenny Craig & co. feel done to death just a few episodes in to the second year, and the new characters--""Computer says no,"" ""Bitty,"" Bubbles--aren't funny enough to dispel the impression that the writers are out of fresh ideas.Walliams and Lucas are excellent actors with a knack for accents, but I wish they'd deepen the writing pool a little to help develop a cast of potentially much funnier characters. I hope Season 3 brings some changes--still like the show, but here in season 2 they're riding the same jokes into the ground."
5,Watch at your own risk!,"I can see clearly now how these two have taken British 'toffee-nosed' culture and so tastefully turned it upside down!Kudos to them and their brilliance.If you are offended, laugh. It's really the best medicine for your condition. :-)"
2,Almost totally Useless,"All the matches except the main event of Masato Tanaka vs Bam Bam Bigelow were clipped. Most were clipped to the point that it was not even fun to watch. The only thing to save the DVD was the fact that the DVD extras were FULL VERSION matches, unlike ALL other FMW DVDs, even the other one released with this one, The Judgement. These Bonus matches were very cool too: Shane Douglas vs Tommy Dreamer for the ECW Title, and The Dudley Boyz vs Sabu and RVD in a great ECW Tag Title Match.Buy it for the Bonus Matches, and avoid all other FMW DVDs like I am, as they seem to be clipping everything except the main events of all their DVDs now."
3,Interesting matchups,"Most of the matches are clipped somewhat, but there's still some good action to see. The DVD is only broken down into 5 or 6 chapters so you'll have to fast forward through to see some matches which just shows laziness on the part of it's creators. I gave it 3 stars because of the all star lineup that is involved though. Here's a rundown of the card.1. Paul Heyman speech2. Buh Buh Ray Dudley vs. The Sandman vs. Terry Funk3.

5,fast delivery,Fast delivery. Product in great condition as described. Thank you. Would buy from this seller again.

2,Not happy,"I read the reviews before I bought this. I bought a size smaller, because everyone said it ran big. For me, a size smaller is too small. Wish I had ordered true to size because now I have to return it. The cost to return is $6.95. Which I'm NOT happy about. That's 23% of the cost to RETURN it! And I had already paid the $6.95 to ship it! So, I wasted $14 for something that didn't fit and I didn't like. So, my recommendation, pass on this outfit.There is NO stretch to this cloth, so there's no ""give"" for bending, etc. and if it shrinks at all when washed, that's a real problem. It wrinkled badly in the packaging, so I would be concerned about that, as well. No one likes walking around in wrinkled clothes. I left it hanging for over a week to see if ANY of the wrinkles would come out, they did not.BTW Made in Guatemala, if you're curious as to where it is imported from.For me, no more purchases from this vendor. Color me VERY unhappy."
2,Not professional quality,"I think this watercolors are not for professionals, because there is no shine in the painting.When the colors are wet, they do not have the same color as they were in the case."
1,Wrong product received,"Very excited to find a easy travel water color set. Problem though. I received ""Crayola"" Washable Kids' Paint (10 assorted colors) instead."
3,Okay but...,"Very handy and small enough to keeping in my purse. Comes with a versatile soft synthetic pointed round brush, which works very well for both thick and thin lines. The quality of the pigments isn't great but works if you're doing VERY soft washes or want VERY transparent colors. Case is flimsy and came with a dent in the middle of the lid that prevented it from closing properly."
4,Lovely Paints,A beautiful collection of colors to paint. Soft and warm tones. The packaging is convenient and portable... I love It!
5,You need to know this...,"These watercolors are very bright. They look very light and faded, when wet, so I thought it was going to be another cheap set. But I was very happy to see that they dried to vibrant colors. The set has a great color selection and It is very inexpensive, but NOT cheap.It comes in a compact and discrete silver box, that it's easy to carry with you at any time for those out of the blue inspiration moments.I'm very pleased with my Purchase."
5,An African Adventue!,"Another wonderful book by Henderson. This was a very exciting one! The discription of the setting was just the right thing to add to this terrific love story. Joseph Desire(dosen't he sound sexy) and Tia are great together. I think this classifies as a love at first sight, I think! Great read!!"
3,This was used by my son...,in the 5th grade science fair. It is foam-like so durable is probably not the best term ---- it really isn't a toy either.It suited its purpose.
2,Not for amateurs,I bought this as an amateur just to play around with some music. It seems like it is designed more for the professional because after about a week I just gave up. Very confusing and the instructions are of no help. I would not recommend this unless you plan on devoting a ton of time in trying to make it work.
5,This was my first Bette Ford novel and I was not disappointe,I loved this novel! I used live in Detroit and I just loved the fact how she makes Detroit look more than just a crime capital of the world! And the characters were real people that have real problems and that can be solved realistically. I love Anthia and I just gaggled over Dexter. I felt like I knew him from a long time ago. She is a great author and I've discovered myself wanting to punch the lights out of both the the characters as the story evoled. The external characters made the book as well and I would like to see one with the son.
5,A Great Love Story,"OK we learned that Dexter had feelings for Anthia in Bette's book ""Forever After"" now Bette brings together the two after Jeff has been released from the hospital and is now attending college. Anthia and Dex have become best friends and have falling in love with each other. After a shared kiss they can not think straight.Anthia was tired of Dex always keeping to himself and never opening up to her. When she comfronts Dex about how she feels she learns of Dex's trouble past. But this does not change the way Anthia feels about him. It just makes her love him even more.I thought Anthia and Dex would never get it together because they were both keeping their feelings from each other. I was truly happy with the ending when everything came together.The secondary characters really help bring this book together. It would be nice to see a story on Anthia's son Jeff and Cora. And also on Dana and Jerome.Go out and get this book and all of Bette's books. You will not be disappointed."
4,"Sad, beautiful and frustrating story",I loved this book. Even tho things worked out in the end as they always do in this genre. I enjoyed the reading the journey Dex and Anthia went through to get there. It must be frustratig to have the love of your life in your life fighting to resist their attraction to you due to some guilt complex. I'm glad Anthia had the courage to go for what she wanted as for Dex he really needed some therapy and not just the sexual kind. Aslog glad good to catch up with the other couples from the past Quinn/Heather Charles/Diane.
2,Not a book for beginners...,"I origionally bought this book as a suppliment to the Halvorson book, thinking it would give me a more solid foundation. I stopped reading the book at chapter 3. The book assumes the reader knows certian basics that many beginners do not know. I also found it frustrating flipping to the back for ""Hints"" which are nothing more than the answers and information you need hidden at the back of the book."
5,Outstanding Modern Jazz,"I heard the song Megalith on a community radio station in Tampa a few years ago and immediately called the station to find out WHO in the world these guys were. T-Square is at the top of their game as they rip through Megalith. It may be my favorite jazz song ever. The remaining songs are each wonderful, as this U.S. release is a ""Best Of"" compilation. Romantic City has a hot caribbean feel. Miss You echoes David Sanborn's sense of melody. Route 405 is a funky trip down the coast. The lilt and pace of Mr. Mellow evokes Ronnie Laws at his best. In fact, every ""smooth jazz"" artist ought to be required to listen to T-Square. In my mind, these guys set the standard for smooth jazz. In addition, the musicianship is absolutely amazing. I am currently exploring the imports of T-Square, so more to some later. Sell you Kenny G at the garage sale and invest in T-Square. Your friends will say "" who in the world is THAT?"" Exactly."
5,Excellent for the price.,"Best thing about this KVM is the Hot-Key function to switch back and forth from the keyboard. Something that is hard to find at this price. You can even set it to not switch the audio.Works great with my wired Microsoft & Logitech 3-button scroll-wheel USB mice using a USB-PS2 adapter. Haven't tried it with USB keyboards however.You can't expect absolute perfect signals by adding another layer such as a KVM in between devices, but from what I can tell Video is excellent. If you pay *extremely* close attention, there is a tiny delay with the mouse, but nothing you'd notice in non-gaming use. I can detect a tiny bit of noise on the audio, but if you're an audiophile you should be connecting directly.Works perfectly under Windows XP x64 and Linux."
1,You get what you paid for.,"I bought it to connect a desktop and a laptop with dock station. It looks great out of the box, with all the connections I want to have.However, it froze every a few hours. Mouse, keyboard, audio channel..., you name it. The only signal it never loses is the video.Finally, I gave up and decided to return it to Amazon.com."
5,Fabulous advice!,"I just finished this book and was so happy I picked it up! Far from finding the author ""preachy"" or ""judgmental,"" I found her simply informative and genuine. I enjoyed the segments about a Vegan pregnancy and how to handle misinformed doctors (of which I've seen my share). I was enlightened by the author's experience with midwives, her views on hospitals and being treated as a body part by doctors and nurses. I was pleased she shared the struggles she endured trying to do the best things possible for her family, despite opposition from outside influences. I appreciated the advice on how to handle relatives and other outsiders disrespectful of her parenting choices. It was encouraging to know there are others who view the world as I do, and I don't have to forge my way in the dark. This book was edifying, affirming and inspirational for me."
5,Can't wait!,"Volume 1 was a shocking discovery.It's made me create a new shelf space of Korean mangas(""Manhwa""). Looking forward to it."
5,"Crunchy guitar, compelling vocals","This is the Juliana Hatfield album that lives in my car. The guitar is crunchy, the vocals compelling, the lyrics brilliantly sarcastic. The tracks Houseboy, Let's Get Married, and Breeders stand out for their suburban dystopia, while Leather Pants is hilarious. Juliana's best song ever, Ten Foot Pole, ends the album with an extremely personal look at desire and self-image. This is not my favorite Juliana Hatfield album (that honor belongs to Please Do Not Disturb), nor is it her prettiest (listen to Beautiful Creature for that), but it is the album I play most often."
1,Not very good,"Juliana's cool, but only when she blends pop with her ""harder"" edge. This album is a waste and an insult to her true fans. Beautiful creature is bad for the opposite reason. I'd rather listen to rap."
5,great improvement,"With this product, you dont need to worry about running out of battery. Great improvement for Sprint PPC-6700."
4,A guide to south Asian languages,"There are several books about languages of south Asia,but this is a book with detail of every important language.There is history and classification of every family of lamguage like Indo-Aryan,Dravidian languages,Austro-Asiatic languages,Tibeto-Burman languages.Author also discuss about the groups of every fanily .There are several tables of languages'families.There are several examples of old scripts of languagesIndeed it is a good book but some times i feel that author copy the informations from other book .Dived crystal is not aware about siraiki language ,he write it Lahnda and the same position is the author of this book ,although he was working on south Asian languages ,but he is not aware about latest position ,although another linguist Russian linguist Simernov khnows it and he describe the new sitution in his book Lehndi language"
2,Not impressed,"Mouse was one of my first Anime featues. I didn't care much for the plots, and the character movement for action sequences was terrible. I did like the clarity and artistic drawings of the characters and their rather overdeveloped......personalities!"
1,I'd Love To Get This!,"But too bad it's being held ""hostage"" for such an ungodly amount... I wonder what good is it to the seller/s if potential buyers (like myself) are scared away by the price?rated 1 star because of the situation"
4,Back when they were up-and-coming,"This is a great album. It may not display all of the refined talent of Taj and Ry's later work, but if you are adventurous (as Taj and Ry always have been) and interested in the their early work, you will be rewarded. I believe that Taj was right out of the Julliard School and Ry was just a teen when they recorded this album. Forgive them if their skill is not perfect, but enjoy this music for its energy and youth."
3,not a trap for all taj & ry fans,"The 1-star review overemphasizes the negative effect of Jesse Lee Kincaid's vocals on this album.I'll be frank. Kincaid definitely is not a good singer. He kind of sounds like a less talented version of the Flying Burrito Brothers after Gram Parsons died (except he kind of tries to sound British on one song).But on the flip side, Kincaid does not sing lead on half of the songs. And a couple of them, he actually pulls it together a little. So, what you end up with is about 15 of the 22 songs here being rocking r&b; sung competently by Taj. Also, it's cool because this is a little different setting that Taj usually has.The only other minor caveat you should know about this album before buying is that Ry Cooder hasn't really come into his own yet. Still good, but not awesome.Overall, this album is worth it for Taj Mahal and Ry Cooder fans."
2,Rising Sons,Interesting in that it shows where Taj Mahal & Ry Cooder came from. But it was still some way to go before they really made an impact. Of greatest interest to those who want a complete catalogue for either artist. Flashes of brilliance but not the bright shining light you see in each artist's later work.
4,Rising Sons Taj Mahal & Ry Cooder,"Interesting blend of guitarists and material. Both players have had storied careers as soloists and appearing with other artists. This is not music that received heavy air play, but if you're a fan of either artist, I believe it can be worth your time to give it a listen."
1,Ry and Taj in Their Garage,"I've been a huge Ry Cooder fan for years and I like Taj Mahal, too. But I can't believe I bought this album. I was so excited to find it, and so disappointed when I listened to it. I couldn't listen to more than a few songs. It sounds like Ry and Taj as junior hight school students hacking away in their garage. There is some good guitar work, but that's it. The production is terrible. It just doesn't have the same tight zip that most of Cooders records have. Sounds like an amateur bootleg."
3,A historically interesting pairing but....,...the quality of the sound is not that great and the magic is not there. No wonder they chose not to publish it for decades...
2,This really is not good at all,The vocals are quite bad throughout and appalling in places. It really does not matter who is playing what because the vocals and the production are so very poor.
3,Warning -- not your usual Barnard,"One of the reasons I am working my way joyfully through all Robert Barnard's books is that he doesn't insert gratuitous scenes of sex and/or violence (emphasis on gratuitous). His earlier books in particular concentrate on marvelous character development, literate and witty writing, and skewering the evil. shoddy, and pretentious. The only added ingredient in this book of short stories is a very noir, occasionally grotesque, and, in one story, desperately sad and twisted slant on humanity. The only story I would care to RE-read is ""Post Mortem""."
3,"OK, but not one of his best....","An interesting thriller, but not one of the author's best (by a long shot). Even more convoluted in many respects than I've come to expect from Ludlum. Paperback copy I bought was one of the most poorly edited texts I've read in a LONG time-- LOTS of typo's, incorrect words, etc"
3,Confusing,The plot is confusing and clumsy; the motives of the characters are vague and unsatisfactory--but there's a reason! This was one of his very first books.
2,"If It Went Any Slower, I'd Fall Asleep At The Wheel","I've enjoyed several Ludlum novels, but this one is very slow and it seems to be going almost no where. I'm half way through and don't see much point in going on except to make the most of money I spent for the CD version. It certainly isn't an action-packed thriller I was hoping for. I'd give it 5 stars for non-action and lots of meaningless ""yadda, yadda, yadda"" if such a category existed."
1,This is the worst Robert Ludlum book I have ever read,"I have read every Robert Ludlum book. This book has no plot line,and to many periphal characters. Sometimes I felt I didn't even know what country the main characters were in. There is absoluletly no redeeming value is this book but to see how far along Mr. Ludlum has come as writer. This was the first book he ever wrote and it was rejected. It should have stayed rejecte"
3,a big let down,"being a ludlum fan,i took this book with great expectations.this book not onlylacks speed and action but also good characterisation.totally it is a big disappointment for ludlum fans.for new ludlum readers i would like to recommend the bourne identity"
2,Not Ludlum's Best!,"After you have read Ludlum's other better books ""Cry of the Halidon"" is without question a bitter dissapointment.The maincharacters involved in the book fail to carry the story. The plot is very confusing and nearly impossible to read and understand.Ludlum must have wrote this book to pay a Lexus note.It is not on a caliber of his previous or later books. If you canfind this book at a used book store buy it. Otherwise leave it alone."
1,Desparately needs a competent editor.,"I have read most of Ludlum's novels, and I usually can't put them down. I found that I was so distracted by the need to correct his grammar, usage, and spelling that I almost didn't finish the book. The story was not bad, but too contrived even for Ludlum, and not nearly as polished or compelling as his later novels. Also, of his dialogue was downright embarrassing in its naive lack of credible inter-sex conversation. Very disappointing for Ludlum."
3,"With some exeptions, solid and interesting book","It is not the best Ludlum, but it keeps you going. I find some of the plot bit naive, but then again most of Ludlum plots are rather fiction. If you like Ludlum, go for it, if you do not like him much stay away from this book."
3,Confusing???,"I have read numerous Ludlum books and I have never had trouble following story line, characters and their importance. However I was quickly proved wrong with The Cry of the Halidon. The abudance of meaningless characters makes the reader annoyed and at sometimes confused. If you are looking for a good book by Ludlum may I suggest The Matarese Countdown."
5,The best of both worlds. Powerful and moving.,"Some of the best cross-cultural music that has come out in the recent years is by Axiom of Choice. No doubt this is the best of the east and west, done with taste, and in a natural way. This is not an album based on compositional commercial formulas but conceived with integrity and knowledge of the Persian roots of the music."
5,One of the best world music albums,"This album is one of the best albums in world music and rarely leaves my CD player. Beautiful melodies, great instruments, great vocals, great rhythms. Truly one of a kind."
5,Persian cross-over music: Excellent!,"If you like Sufi Dreams by Mercan Dede, or Arvo Part's Alina, or Djivan Gasparyan and Michael Brook on Black Rock, or June Tabor's Abyssinians, or the Bang on a Can version of Brian Eno's Music for Airports --if you like any one of those works-- then I'm sure you will find great pleasure in listening to this superb album of Persian cross-over music. Some tracks are quiet and contemplative, some are sad and plaintive, and some are marked by energetic dance rhythms. Mamak Khadem --I could listen to her lovely voice on """"Greener than God's Dream"" and ""Raindrops"" for hours on end. The instrumentalists here are excellent . And the recording engineers have done fine work too. Bravo, Narada."
5,Music of great compositional value,"This is music with lovely nuances, beautiful melodies, intricate and great rhythms, and last but not least great execution. The music just takes you to another realm. Mamak Khadem's voice is out of this world and her singing (Persian vocals are quite challenging) impressive. I am amazed at how she manages to express so many different emotions. I had never heard anything quite like Axiom of Choice's music before. This is entirely unique. My hats off to them for such a fine piece of work."
5,Excellent stuff!,"This CD is just great music. Forget about whether it is Middle Eastern, Persian, fusion of East and West... it just doesn't matter. It is simply great music and one of a kind. A superb addition to your music collection."
5,Very Nice,"I purchased this for my snakes terrarium. Its really cool and unique, and came on time. The only thing i didnt like about it was the hollow bottom, where my snake could climb up inside and become stuck. I still give it 5 stars because it is intended for underwater usage, not snake jungle gyms. My betta will love it :)"
3,Need To Give It Another Chance,I never really gave this cd a chance. I love Cyndi and i have all her cds. But this is the one i listen to the least. I really can not grow into it. I think that it might grow on me but i love the other stuff better before and after.
4,Cyndi shines on this album,"I think this is a pretty good album from Cyndi. It's really too bad that it didn't get the attention it deserved, but that's usually the way with music that doesn't quite fit the mainstream. Cyndi makes music, not for commercial success, but just for the joy of it, and that is something that true music fans can appreciate. In fact, the best music out there is not necessarily the stuff we hear on the radio. And with this album Cyndi also showcases her songwriting skills...I recommend this album not just to fans of Cyndi Lauper, but to those music fans who like to hear music other than the same old radio fare. 12 page booklet contains all the lyrics."
4,The strong Cyndi Lauper.,"Cyndi Lauper in ""Hat Full Of Stars"" was great. The three songs that are very beautiful are ""Like I use to"", ""A Part Hate"" and ""Hat Full Of Stars"". The song ""Like I use to"" tells everyone just to be yourself and not judge people for who they were. I love this album of Cyndi Lauper!"
5,A surprisingly eclectic mix of entertaining songs,"The eclectic mix of songs on this album is surprising and entertaining. You'll want to get up and dance to ""That's What I Think"". Songs like ""Broken Glass"" and ""A Part Hate"" will raise your concience. ""Sally's Pigeons"" and ""Hat Full of Stars"" will make you cry. The light hearted ""Feels Like Christmas"" will make you laugh out loud and bring you joy when you finally learn the words well enough to sing along. Listening once is all it will take to know these songs are a work of genius. Listening twice should be all it takes to make this album a treasure Cyndi Lauper fans will play over and over again. Trust me, you will soon know the words to all of these songs, by heart."
5,The Master Piece,"This is the master piece of pop music!!!! There's nothing like that!Cyndi present us with perfect voice, songs and arrangements!"
4,"Cyndi in pensive, moody spirits","Turns out Cyndi Lauper's true '90's colors were black & white(epitomized by this album's photography)and the music seems equally forlorn. She's cynical on the autobiographical ""Product of Misery"", sentimental on ""Who Let in the Rain"", frisky on ""Feels Like Christmas"" but reflective for the sad nostalgia of ""Sally's Pigeons"", angry on ""Broken Glass"", and finally world-conscious on ""A Part Hate"". It's a heady mix of emotions, mostly in dark shades, but the subtle hip-hop arrangements and influences keep it bubbling, and the production is first-rate. No real stand-out songs, but ""Stars"" works as a full-bodied piece(perhaps that's why there were no hit singles). As always, Cyndi gives her all. She's never half-hearted: she bleets, she bleeds, she's stormy, she's fiery, she's sad. She's anything but coy. Fans will love it. 'B+'"
1,doesn't work as it should,"My TV is only 4 years old and this is not compatible with it. It renders pictures very fuzzy and red from both the DVD palyer and the VCR. It has a buzz in the sound, doesn't have a remote, and is a huge disappointment. I really regret buying it, as it has failed on every level"
4,Nice little CD,"I was searching for one song in particular (Good morning, Jesus) but do not regret having to purchase the entire CD. This CD has a nice variety of gospel styles from 'churchy' to contemporary. Whatever style you like, you will find it on this project. I love that I can get old school, new school, jazz all on the same CD in the gospel genre. Good purchase."
4,My daughter loves orange cream.,My daughter loves orange cream and I don't have to worry if my daughter missa meal.
5,A Special Place for Santa,"I agree with the first reviewer. It is an excellent book for those who try to keep the true meaning of Christmas sacred, yet enjoy the celebration of Christmas. Santa has become a very important part of Christmas tradition, and this book helps explain how historically that occurred. Reading this book will become a part of our family traditions, at least as long as we have children at home. I am trying to find a hard cover copy for my church's library."
4,Just what I expected!,"The quilt book I ordered, Block by Block, was just what I expected it to be. The book was delivered in a timely fashion and in good condition. I would order again from this source."
4,More complete CD,"This Storyville issue of Duke Ellington's show My People does have quite a few more songs from the show than appeared on previously issued CD's. It is a great documentation of how the actual show sounded. However, the notes in the accompanying booklet are poorly written and tainted by numerous inaccuracies. (I know because I was in the band that played the show's premier performance in Chicago.) The CD has some great music and is a valuable piece of musical/theatrical history."
3,On and Organizational Kick...,"I would have rated this book higher if it had been the first book I read about organization. However, I purchased 5 at the same time while on a work space organizational kick. I read Organizing Your Workspace by Odette Pollar first as it states it's a quick read. Paper Tiger gave the same basic organization structure as Pollar's book, but with a more interesting and real tone than Pollar. However, Paper Tiger spent the second half of the book on the big picture of organizational organization, the home office, computer files, and long term maintenance of the filing system. Things I'm not interested in right now that I am in the overwhelming start of a new organizational process. This info may be helpful to me in a few months when I have established a routine and can concentrate on long term maintenance. I would have found more practical time saver tips and starting advise a better help."
4,Note that there's now an updated version!,"I read this and another of Barbara Hemphill's books several years ago, and found her advice useful. However, sometimes life changes and you have to revamp your systems. Recently I've been looking for organizing books available for Kindle, and was happy to come across a new version of this book. And I mean come across literally--Barbara Hemphill is one of the authors, but as of this date the book doesn't show up in the Kindle store under her name. And there's nothing here referring to the Kindle version either. I really only stumbled upon it by accident.Taming the Paper Tiger in the Digital Age @ HomeIt doesn't seem to be available in printed form. It's written with a co-author, Jennifer Wig, but rest assured it's still as good as Hemphill's books have always been, and recognizes how much life has changed with the advent of smartphones, gps, and so forth. I'll be writing a more detailed review for the Kindle version when I get the time..."
1,Not the 'Hello' song Dan Zanes I was expecting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I will never chance a CD again. We hate this. It's so slow...boring...and it reminds me of country music. Someone mentioned Lyle Lovett. Yes, I can see that. Wish I had known. I am going to sell mine asap! And buy Lori Berkner's kid cd's soon instead!"
5,Great kid's stuff... (I used that as an excuse to buy this.),"Great stuff. Great for kids, and great for parents who share the space in their minivan with young ones."
4,"Carolyn's Review oCharles A, Lindbergh A Human Hero",I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It gave many details about the first solo flight across the Atlantic. it showed that while a national hero Lindbergh was still a regular human with his own ideas & opinions.
5,simply amazing,"MxPx keeps getting better, and their music constantly deals with the most common issues of everyday life. This one's got a good mix of the faster music diehard MxPx fans love, along with some amazing vocals, and some songs that are a little more on the softer side. Every one of their albums is lyrically strong, but this one really challenges you more than the others, to stop and think about your life. I say you grab this album, you can't go wrong."
3,Hmmm maybe punk is dead,"Ho hum, i rushed to the store to buy me the new MxPx album. And guess what It's a great! rock album, notice i sed rock and not punk. Well mxpx have sold out like a lot of other bands, Yep they're a rok+roll band now. Still buy this album but mxpx's punk days r over, and they're n o longer my fave band, how cud u guyz do this to a loyal fan like me?"
2,Epitome of pop-punk,"I liked Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo, but it seems that Mxpx is running out of music, and also lyrics. they never had very deep vocals, which is very apparent on this cd. And this cd is definitely a lot softer than their previous albums, its getting very boring. They are turning more and more into a chic band."
1,awful,"this band thinks that they're punk just because they're less known than good charlotte, simple plan, yellowcard, and all the rest. my sister put this cd in my car stereo when she was borrowing my car recently the next time i got in my car i saw the cd and decided since i had never heard of them, to see what they sounded like. they sound exactly like good charlotte. i agree with the reviewer that said to listen to pennywise. they at least understand that punk is an attitude, not a way of dressing. my favorite cd by them is about time so check it out"
5,Sounds like green day...great album!,"This album just might be mxpx's greatest yet, the songs have great beat,and catchy lyrics. I think mxpx might be a new popular bands such as blink 182. If you dont have this album and you like bands like blink and green day, BUY IT!"
5,This album RAWKS!,"I have about 7 MXPX albums, and I have to say that this one is definitely my fav. The songs are really catchy, and despite all these reviews saying that is more pop than punk, I think the album is really great. It has a more mature sound than the older, more ""punk"" albums and the songs have more variations. The older stuff is good, mind you, but a lot of the songs all sound the same, unlike this album. I also like the fact that these guys are considered Christian rock.. the lyrics are clean and sometimes refer to God and such. All the songs are great, but my favorites have to be ""My Life Story"", ""Buildings Tumble"", ""Responsibility"", ""Is the Answer in the Question"", ""Foolish"", ""Unsaid"", ""It's Undeniable"", and ""Misplaced Memories"". Anyway, if you like this album, ""Teenage Politics"", ""Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo"", and ""Life and General"" are also sweet.Anyway, bottom line, this album is awesome and is a must-have!"
3,Responsibility-something they need to think about,"MXPX use to be punk, but they are the ones responsible for if they keep their fans. This cd made me never buy anymore. It is so pop i thought I would drop dead the first time i heard it. The first few are okay, but seriously, lets go back to some punk roots here guys, your starting to sound like Blink 182."
3,"Good Pop, but not much Punk here....","I will give to them, MxPx has created a good album, but its bordering on not even being punk anymore. You can only go so poppy before you leave punk behind. Those of you who loved their first few albums, (Pokinatcha, Teenage Politics, and Life in General) will probably be disappointed with EPM. I hear Mike Herrera doesn't even listen to punk anymore. Elvis Costello and Country are his favorites now, and it shows through his songwriting. Don't get me wrong, its good catchy stuff, but its a real let down when you consider how awesome they use to be.."
3,"Good, but not good","I have to say that I kinda like this album, buty I found it musically grew old to me quite quickly. It isn't as strong in the guitarwork as previous albums and the drums seem to be washed out and more poppy. Mike's vocals are definitly his best but overall the ablum has a more pop feel and lacks some of the energy of previous albums.If you like this album I definitly suggest you check out their album LIFE IN GENERAL."
2,Why?,"Well, here we are again. You know kids, back in my day, punk music was punk. This latest offering from one time excellent punk rock act MxPx lacks in the whole ""punk"" area, and in a rather huge amount. They have lost there hardcore edge and opted for the, dare i say it, sold out sound of todays blink182's. In my opinion, they are headed the wrong way and i find this rather sad.Dont get me wrong, if your into this pop-punk sound, then this is the album for you my freind!"
5,Quality Work No Matter What YOU say!!!,"Ok...Heres the deal I was hardcore impressed with this cd. I on one hand enjoy the side of MxPx that is slower punk. Some may say it sounds too much like Blink but only Mxpx perpetrators say that. Blink's songz mean nothing to anyone. Mxpx by my opinion show that they are truly the best writters in Punk Rock today. The tunes are catchy to where you wanna get up and dance around. I almost pissed my pants when i heard this cd. Add this one to your collection. I did. You should. Nuff Said. I'm glad Mxpx is back to the ""Slowly Going the Way of the Buffalo"" stage again. Get this one and listen to Number 7. Best Song. Get it. NUFF SAID....PEACE.."
4,Good CD,"I have to say that this CD rocks, its not quite as good as Teenage Politics or a couple of the others, but it ranks right up there. If you like MXPX you'll like this album."
3,"""Responsibility...what's that?""","Have Magnified Plaid (MxPx) finally grown up? Has their sound finally become (gasp)...RADIO-FRIENDLY? I'll let you decide the answer to the first question. The answer to the second question, I'm afraid, though, is yes. You'll be able to tell that from the opening track. Even though it's the most driving track on the CD, it sounds like so much of the other mainstream punk-rock candy that's out there I had to look at the cover again to make sure this was MxPx. Don't get me wrong; these guys did a good job on this album. It does get better...a little bit, anyway. The rushing-beat angst of their previous albums has been diluted somewhat; the songs a little slower and easier to follow than say, ""Punk Rawk Show"" or the like. Whether that's a good or bad thing is up to you. If you liked MxPx's earlier stuff, this CD may give you a bad vibe. But punk fans should dig it. Not their best stuff, but pretty good."
2,It's not that great,"Mxpx were solidly putting out great albums. They were in between an underground and mainstream band for a little while. I mean they're on a major label but their songs dont get played that much on the radio and they don't sell millions of albums. They probably sell almost as much as Nofx, pennywise, no use for a name bands like that. This album is better than the new piece of crap they put out a year ago but man not by much, this is actually going away from their punk roots and into more just straight up rock n roll like foo fighters. there are some good songs on here but there are alot of songs that sound the same and are startinig to sound kinda whiny. Mxpx is on a hunt to sell out so buy as many of their records as possible so they can start putting out better albums even though i don't think that's gonna happen anytime soon."
1,ever passing moment,"Who added the softener? The greatly anticipated new MXPX cdmust have fell in their clothes hamper at home. Then from what Ifigure, their mother put it in the washer with the towels. She put the Tide in.. the Downty in.. and there you go.... Softness. Feels so good, but sounds so bad. Luv MXPX, but come on. Try ""Strung Out"" and ""NOFX"" till MXPX goes back to work on their next album. Don't get me wrong.... I have all their cd's.. This ones for the ""14 year olds lookin' to rebell"". Adios... Marc."
3,Good But Could Be Better. :),"If your a newcomere to MxPx then donm't get this cd first. jGet MxPx Live At The Show like i did. This is their, what i call ""Practice"" cd. It was one of their first and they were trying new songs like ""responsibility"", ""Two Whole Years"" and ""Buildings Tumble"". They are just starting out but i have to admit this is one of my favs but they did need to add more punk. Also Listen to ""The Next Big Thing""! It was featured as the beginning song on the Playstation 1 game Supercross 2000! So if you want thaT SONG AND A GOOD GAME FOR ps1 Then Get Supercross 2000!"
2,Going The Way Of .... uhh ... they stopped.,"I love MXPX , and as they have matured , their music has matured with them... But in GTWOTB their pace stopped- and they started sounding the same... no creativity...poppy , and at the end-182ish. In this CD , they sound exactly the same as their previous attempts. This CD is great for all you pop kids - liston to this review some kid wrote ... This album just might be mxpx's greatest yet, the songs have great beat,and catchy lyrics. I think mxpx might be a new popular bands such as blink 182. If you dont have this album and you like bands like blink and green day, BUY IT! .... if you wrote or can relate to this review , this CD's perfect for you ... he thinks mxpx might be a new ""popular bands"" such as blink 182... blink 182 was recently popularized ! , mxpx has been popular for awhile , recently mainstreamed - anyways , if you don't own any of MXPX's recent releases , I guess go with this one... i dunno."
4,MXpx Latest one,This is a very kool cd but is not the best they have but it is very kool I have it and i like it I think the best songs are Responsibilty(3) Prove it to the worl(5) and My life story(1)
2,MxPx's WORST,"This is without a doubt MxPx's alltime worst. This is one of the worst Pop-Punk album I have ever heard(Well, with the exeption of a couple records by bands like Sum 41 or Blink, but we're talking about MxPx!). MxPx has a couple of my all time favorite songs (Life in General, Swing Set Girl), but this is just bad. It sounds like Green Day losing all of thier origionality and song writing skills(thank god I can still count on Green Day!).Songs like Responsibility have totally mislead people about how great of a band they are. Check out ""Slowly Going The Way of the Buffalow"", ""Teenage Politics"" or ""Life in General"", but please do not rate the band by this album. MxPx is to great of a band to let up. Please do not listen to this album. It's a waste of time and energy. My first exposure to this band was through the album ""Let it Happen"". Get that first. Get this last."
3,different,"if you like poppy punk, you'll prolly like this one. but if you like the old stuff, you might not like this one. i prefer the older albums, this one is mediocre."
3,okay...,"this cd is awesome by other bands standards, but mxpx can do better. they have smoothed out their sound way to much for my taste. what happened to the stuff they showed in pokinatcha through life in general...that's the mxpx i want to see"
2,it doesn't sound like mxpx,"This last Mxpx album is the worst they have made. If you like punk music I think you could only like the first three songs, then the album turns too boring."
5,MxPx!,"This is an awesome CD from start to end, I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes catchy punk music. The whole CD is great but I especially liked Buildings Tumble,Is The Answer In The Question, and my favorite One Step Closer To Life. This is my favorite MxPx CD better then ""slowly Going the way of the buffalo"" and ""let it happen"". BUY IT NOW!"
2,Not What I Expected,First off let me say I love Legos (I am 38 years young) but I was a little disappointed by this set. The building skill level was ok but the Hockey Rink was a major bummer. I would think that Lego could have come up with something a little better than a heavy gauge plastic ice rink that comes folded over (you have to fight the creases in the plastic when playing). I would have liked to see a flooring system similar to the Basketball or Soccer sets (Lego plates or tiles). I would not recommend buying this set if you want to play with it (by the individual kits and a piece of plexi glass) but for building the hokey players its ok.
1,goodenuf,My son got this for Christmas last year and what a cheat piece of crap! My son loves hockey and legos so we thought what a great combination. This set is NOT worth the money!!! The players are fine it is the rink that makes this set a waste of money. My kitchen floor works better. The plastic rink will not lay flat as the creases from being folded don't flatten out and over time our stickers keep peeling off. Lego need to go back to the drawing board and come up with an ice rink to be built out of legos which is what I expected to begin with.
1,Disappointed Lego Fan,"My 9 & 6 year-old sons received this set for Christmas. They played with it for about 10 minutes. It is now under the bed. We are huge LEGO fans, but we are very disappointed with this set. The boys find it boring. It is also hard to store once set up."
1,Don't waste your money,What a waste! My son loves hockey & wanted this so bad but when we opened it we couldn't believe how cheesy this was. The rink is a folded piece of flimsy plastic. You're better off to just but the players separately like we did. Very disappointing and overpriced.
5,A marvel for the mind,"If you love crime/mystery books... prepare to be spellbound. I love this book.It was recommended to me along with the information that this great crime book ""is impossible to make into a film."" If you think Hollywood can do 'anything' with a book, read this and understand why it couldn't bring this to the screen. It's all in the pages that you will want to turn faster and faster.This book is proof that movies can never surpass the art of novel writing.P.S. The author on the cover, Cameron McCabe, is actually the name of the main character in the book. Adds to the intrigue."
1,Save your money,"It's tooo simplistic. Very few things are explained well, especially TCP/IP and subnet masks. Although it's not a specific MCSE book, I found Mark Minasi's book on NT Networking (Server?), more thorough and understandable.I hope the CD is of more help in passing this test."
2,TOO MANY ERRORS!!!!,"I found this book contained too many errors. Example is regedit not regedit32 is used to search the registry. Also the hyperlinks on the CD, if they worked at all, went to the wrong location. I received no response from the inquiries I posted at their web site. As a result of this experience, I will never purchase a Syngress Media book again. I found Newriders to be a better study guide."
1,Kindly check the cover page link,Is it really the cover of the book? The title says it's NT server 4.0 but the following text on the cover page says it's workstation 4.0! I think I'm confused here.
5,"Very good for self-study manuals, lots of practice exams","I am responsible for making sure three members of my team get their MCSE certification. We sent them to an ATEC course and also bought copies of the Workstation, Server and Enterprise books in this series. They were an excellent complement to the course and reinforced all of the major points that will be on the exam. There are many demo exams on the CD...although they are generally not the full package there are enough questions overall to test yourself."
5,Insight on tap,"I highly recommend this for anyone in a corporation to read. If nothing else, this book will change your thinking about what makes an IT department run well. The wealth of insight about reducing IT spend in a responsible way is particularly comprehensive and useful."
5,Nympholepsy!,"Although intended for the classicist, this excellent, erudite book is accessible to general readers (like me). Prof. Larson surveys everything that is known about nymphs, from their appearances in Greek literature to evidence of cult worship. She deals with little-known subjects like nympholepsy (which is NOT what Nabokov thought it was) and leads us on a tour of caves devoted to nymph worship. Illustrated with numerous black and white photos (but no Victorian paintings of nymphs; it isn't that kind of book). Hard to believe this is the first book on nymphs, but there will be no need for a second; this is definitive."
5,comfort,This is the most comfortable heeled shoe I have ever owned. I recommend this to anyone who will be on their feet alot and want style at the same time. I danced all night and my feet felt great~!
4,too much clipping!,"this dvd has all the matches from the 10th anniversary show.sadly within 40mins they show all the matches except 3...tokyopop have made this dvd as more of an advert for the commercial video because they cut down a brilliant 4 hour show to a meesly 2 hour highlights reel.lets hope in future they show the full eventsapart from those gripes, its a great disc with 3 excellent full matches and good highlights albeit short"
3,Enough with the clipping!,"Only two of the matches are shown in their entirety, Tanaka/Fuyuki and H/Gannosuke. The other matches are all clipped. The two unclipped matches are excellent, and I can recognize that a major chunk of time had to be devoted to recapping the Hayabusa/Gannosuke fued, but the tape should have been extended to two and a half hours (it clocks in under two) and a couple of more matches (such as the ECW ones, which could have been used a selling point in the U.S.) shown in full. As such, I can only recommend it with reservations."
5,Rocket Heart! Rocket Heart! Rocket Heart!,"As a once-and-never-again Providencian and San Franciscan, this CD reminds me of the joy of the Tuesday Weld, John O'Brien's old band. O'Brien constructs new songs and re-records old Weld standbys that take the old but successful Weld formula of jangly, smart pop into the 21st Century. O'Brien's so innocent voice and wry lyrics lend a touching humanity and the subtle humor that permeates each song. This hi concept/low budget music succeeds in getting your feet a-tapping, your mind a-cranking and your lips a-grinning. My only disappointmnet is that O'Brien did not give us seven or eight tracks of ""Rocket Heart,"" which is a monumental tribute to the powers of sensitive, tall, white-boy loving. The song speaks to me as few ever have! I wait with baited breath on the edge of my seat for the follow up recording which will hopefully include that old standby and crowd-pleasing favorite, ""Max Weber, the Father of Modern Sociology."""
4,Pretty Good,"This is a nice, very simple replica for display. The sword is sturdy and it has a ring at the end of the hilt for hanging. The only dissapointment was the lack of fine detail, but it's still an affordable replica of Cloud's Sword."
2,Reluctant to recommend,10 days into using the camera on a vacation it locked up and had to be repaired. Panasonic refused to replace the camera. I now have a repaired camera for the price of a new one.
2,"A good product, with some drawbacks","I was quite excited to acquire the PV-DV910, until I discovered 2 major ""problems"": the camera has no input device (i.e., if you want to translate your VHS into digital, tough luck), and most ridiculous, the unit shuts off every few (short!!!) minutes, so that when you record, and stop for a while, waiting for the best shot, the camera shuts off automatically, and by the time you reboot, you have lost a valuable shot."
4,Very Good Product,"I got this camera as a christmas gift and have been using it 1-2 hours per week since then with no problems. I also purchased a firewire editor (studio dv) and it works great with the PV 910 allowing titles, sound effects, non linear editing and much more. I love the light included with the camera and the size/weight. I highly recommend it."
1,It's too tough for an amateur,"I upgraded from a Sony Hi8 to take on a trip through Europe. I had lots of problems because it always shuts off automatically. My old Sony did the same but could reboot in jus ta few seconds. This one takes forever so you have to be ""timing"" when you want a good shot. Plus the batteries seemed to drain really fast."
2,poor repair service,"When my camera was 4 months old, it malfunctioned. Per instructions, I checked the error code, recorded the code and sent for repair. The response was frustrating to say the least, I would assume an error code would give an indication of the region of problem since there are a series of codes. However, the response is a clerical person calling to get authorization for a blanket charge of $295 plus shipping to even look at the camera. There is no refund if the problem proves simple to repair. I will not take another chance on needing Panasonic service for future equipment purchases."
3,"Not bad, but needs improvement","I bought this camera after reading lot of reviews. This is the first video camera that I have bought. Few things which PV-DV910 lacks is that it does not come with any software so as to edit the Digital Video in the PC, no firewire cables - even though it has IEEE1394 port for transfer. Eventhough it says 300x digital zoom, the system does not go beyond 36x. The performance is very poor in low lighting. Out door in normal sunlight, it is great. Overall not too happy for the money that I paid for it."
4,Good camera but could use some improvements.,"I've had the camera for about a month now and for the most part I am please with it. There are however, serveral design flaws that are annoying.1. The auto shutoff. It should be user selectable. The support rep I spoke with said it was to preserve the video head and tape mechanism, not to mention the battery life.2. There is no video titling!3. You cannot access the menus while in record mode.There are a few more but you get the idea.It's still a nice camera."
3,Fun high class travel mystery,Good descriptions of how rich people eat and travel and nice romance without any sexual act descriptions. The quantity of characters and layered plots keep the mystery to the end.
5,My 11 year old loved it.,"After having gone through several yoyos, he was excited to play with this one. I really don't know much about the different yoyos, but if my 11 year old loved it, and my 2 year old couldn't break it (I can't tell you how many times it was banged, tossed, knocked on, etc.), it gets two thumbs up in my book!"
5,Great yo-yo for a great price,"My skills with the yo-yo are intermediate, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations. I was expecting the yo-yo to be kind of flimsy, but so far it has been rock solid (if you've played with cheap yo-yo's like the ""Turbo Yo-Yo"" by Big Time Toys, you'll know what I'm talking about), also it is nice to be able to switch between manual and automatic settings, I tend to prefer manual because of the longer sleep time, but I also really like the auto because it really zips back up. Overall, its an amazing yo-yo and I'd recommend it to any beginner or intermediate player, it also comes with a really great price. If you're considering purchasing a yo-yo, look to the Yomega Power Brain XP...YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!"
3,Good yoyo...for a while,"I purchased two of these yoyos for my boys, aged 13 and 9. Both boys love them and have them in their hands frequently. However, I am glad that the yoyo's came with extra strings as they started freying almost immediately. Also, after a couple of weeks, the yoyos make a strange grinding sound when they are at the bottom of their swing. I can't imagine yoyo's whose stings are falling apart and making strange noises after only a month. But...there you have it. The kids love them, but the two that I go seem to have some quality issues."
1,Do not buy,"There is absolutely no reason to buy this product. The ""power brain"" makes the hard part of throwing a sleeper even harder, making it absolutely worthless. The internal mechanism is horrible, it consistently twists your string making it impossible to throw the yo-yo strait down. Do not buy, I became so frustrated with it I threw it away after about 1 hour of agonizing use. Worst 17 dollars I ever spent."
5,Yo Yo Power brain,My children have lots of fun with this toy. It is well constructed and durable. And it creates good hand-eye co-ordination. We enjoy it very much.
5,pretty darn awsome!,"this yoyo is great for beginers and intermediates.the smart switch + brain technology is in GENIUS! my son was enthusiastic about it. although it still woudn't sleep when thrown his hardest, he still liked the great yoyo and says he recomends it for both looping and string tricks."
3,yoyo jinx,"Maybe it's just me, but for some reason this yoyo leans to one side. I have noticed this with many different yoyos over the years and it has always stumped me. Can't figure out why a yoyo doesn't go up and down completely straight. They always seem to lean to one side. Oh well, this one seems to made well and I do like the locking hub feature. If you aren't cursed like me with leaning yoyos, this is a good one and well worth the money."
3,Lame string,"My son got this much ""needed"" yo yo and the string knotted and broke with in hours. He still tries to play with it, but it was a disappointment."
2,Won't come back up,"I was very excited to get this yo-yo. At first it was very good but after a while,but when the switch was off of the auto mode it would never come back up. I would kick it, I would wobble it around. This yo-yo is very unreliable. DO NOT GET IT!! I would rather get the Fireball."
4,Yo! YO!!!!,"Cool item, though oiling it every time you play is kind of obnoxious. Overall good product. Its fun learning some new tricks too!"
2,Not the right yoyo for me...,"The yomega power brain XP is a great yoyo for people who like to do little tricks but also want to play with a regular yoyo. Its sleep time is very small and when you do the regular yoyo it sometimes flips around and spins around. the good thing is that you can wind it up easily. After a little bit, it stops working and apparently you have to use this oil to put on the axle and then replace the srting soon after... So not worth the money of it plus the amount of oil and new string.For some people, this is the right yoyo for them, but this yoyo just did not work out well for me. For all those people out there who have never tried yoyoing before and this is your first time with a trick yoyo, AND you want a high performing one that you can learn to do real big and awesome tricks on, this is not the yoyo for you. I would recommend that you get the ooch yo, hyper-wrap heavy wing, or maverick. Or you could go to yoyojam or yoyofactory instead."
5,Very good yoyo and durable,"I've had this yoyo for over 2 years now with no issues. With the clutch switch is very easy to do cool tricks like walking the dog, rock the cradle and some others ... and I'm not even very good! My kids have beat on it but it keeps on yoyo'ing."
5,The best ever,"Length:: 0:40 MinsBarry Crocker's reading of Chapter Four of this incredible, wonderful, and inspiring series is without doubt the best yet. Every child should have a copy of this simply stunning performance."
3,Something for Drummers and Dancers,"Both Watts and Keltner have played on countless great rock albums, but neither are really great jazz drummers; that's okay, as there's really not much on this album that could be taken for jazz. Most of it is based on the eighth-note ostinato that characterizes the bulk of rock music. It's all interesting, to a point, but I don't think there's much here that has the timelessness of a good Stones album or any number of great Keltner-backed album."
3,unexciting,"A tributary album that ultimately falls short in my judgment, this experiment becomes far too cyclic and unexciting early on in our listening. The potential for great music existed when Keltner and Watts decided to collaborate, but this album does not make use of their talents appropriately. The overall structure is loose and chaotic, with repetitive beats that go on for miles on end in each direction.This isn't the worst music you'll ever hear in life, but it isn't the best either. I don't despise this record; I just did not enjoy it. While the collaboration itself was somewhat mythical, the musical result was nauseating repetition. This is not an album that I toss in very often, and I will likely end up just trading it in with the record shop nearby."
5,Torah is revealed wisdom,"Torah is revealed wisdom and as such it must be revealed or received. We can pass along knowledge but true wisdom must be received. There is a word in the Jewish tradition for the receiving of this revealed wisdom from Torah -- it is Kabbalah.This one book by Rabbi Menachem Schneerson is full of Kabbalah and gems of Torah. Rabbi Schneerson was a master teacher. Teachings such as ""faith begins where understanding ends"" and ""religious life is not a matter of suddenly arriving, but of constantly journeying"" are explained from the Jewish wisdom tradition (Kabbalah).The weekly Torah portion doesn't change. We change and can receive from Rabbi Schneerson's inspired teachings. This collection was assembled from teachings toward the end of the Rebbe's life and is filled with wisdom from experience.If I have to name one book of mysticism that inspired me most - it would be this book."
4,Just a question,"The soundtrack is okay but i was a bit disappointed when i realized that one the of the better songs used in the movie wasnt on the soundtrack. Im not sure of the name or who it is by, but it is the song that is played after sandras characters room-mate O.D.'ed, if anyone knows who it is by or what it is called please let me know,thanks in advance :) (evan_fan@msn.com)"
3,Lacking,"Anyone with a love for the movie will find this typical and reminiscent however, it's short with no surprises. Not really worth the money unless you are a die hard fan of the movie."
2,A better order would make this a better CD,"I ordered this soundtrack for the Loudon Wainwright tunes, particularly White Whinos, and am disappointed that the instrumental tracks from the movie are mixed in with the vocal tracks. I prefer soundtracks that put all of the instrumental music at the end so I don't have to bother programming my player to skip those tracks. Not that the instrumental isn't good--it just doesn't flow very well. I am very pleased with the Wainwright ditties!"
3,Excelent Music compilation,"This CD has one of the best compilation for the 28 days movie, it reflects exactly the emotion felt when I watched the Movie."
4,Interesting and Intelligent Humor,"The author does a good job of being humorous in describing the plight of modern churches. Called to be in the world but not of the world, many are becoming entrenched in political debate and in ""showy"" Christianity rather than authentic spiritual conversion. The author provides well-documented instances problems with the church in the public forum and provides insight on how things can be improved. Her insights are thought provoking, sincere, and respectful."
1,Not that funny,I'm sorry but I've read books a lot funnier (Christian Culture Survival Guide) and a lot more intelligent (God's Politics) then this one. I was hoping for some edgy satirical writing that The Door is known for. The author seemed to have chickened out on Chapter 6 (Too Queer for Words) as the entire chapter was 4 pages long and made little sense.If you want to check it out sit down with a cup of coffee at a bookstore and browse it for about 10 minutes and you'll know what I mean.
1,it vanished,"i just ordered the magic knight rayearth dvd box set 3 days ago, and just went to check on the shipping progress, and it has vanished from my order history. i checked my card balance, and i have still payed for it!! i want my dvds, or a full refund immediatlly"
5,My 2 cents worth,"First of all, I am an amateur photographer.This kit is exactly as stated.... high quality in my opinion.Works perfectly so far, just don't forget that the Circular Polarizing filter is adjustable. (it means that even after you screw it on, it can still turn, this is normal and allows for different levels of polarization). Buy this kit... it's inexpensive and high quality.FYI - the lens cover still snaps onto these filters just fine."
3,worth the money.,"The polarizing filter does not always work, you have to guess when to stop turning. You may unscrew the filter from the lens when turning."
2,Nothing to be excited about,"I don't know much about polarized lenses but I am not too excited by this product. I have played around with it but my pictures come out with grades of color without uniformity, and can't seem to get a good setting.It also adversely affects my autofocus. I get sharper images without the lens.The poor result I get maybe my fault but its not been worth the trouble. So use your judgement and check other reviews and other lenses before you buy."
2,good price but bad quality,pro - good pricecons - bad image quality and very hard to rotate this filter.
4,"Courageous, wonderful","I disagree with the reader from Naples. This wasn't meant to be a text book. It's clearly written for survivors of sexual abuse by nuns. I know. I 'm one of them. Now I know I'm not some kinda freak. Nobody wants to talk about this. I never heard about a book about this until this one. The stories made me cry. My sister, who didn't go to Catholic school, read it and cried, too. We can really talk now."
4,the shocking truth,"We always hear about the priests who molest boys and girls, but here is the more rare reality of nuns who sexually misuse children. And this book also deals with nuns who are sexual abuse survivors of fellow nuns. A most intriguing and disturbing study, I believe it's the only one of its kind; I only wish it had been longer. I thank the author, herself a past victim of this form of abuse, for having the courage to write this book to warn and inform people like me and to help others like her.(...)"
1,Disappointing,"The author claims she met her goals one of which was to produce the first major work to address sexual abuse by nuns.I do not see how she has done that. Her work is far from scholarly, she uses few if any references and so on.It was a complete disappointment and waste of money."
5,Prophetic,"I've never read this book but I had to respond to the previous reviewer. I give this book five stars based on it's correct prophecies. The market tanked alright.I love reading what previous reviewer has to say! Pure bull mania. Of course, I was hardly any better back then. So we now know that tech doesn't need a new valuation metric and that boomers can put their money under their mattresses like the Japanese have been doing for the last decade. I guess private purchase price means something after all ;)"
1,Alarmist drivel that misses the point,"I love reading books like this, especially a few years after the fact. The authors, in a condescending fashion, talk about how the bull market cannot possibly extend itself and that technology (again!) investment is for fools.They base their thoughts on antiquated P/E analysis and don't ever answer where the boomers are going to put their money in the case of a correction.The main concern with people like this (and Rifkin, et al) is that they don't recognize that technology represents a new paradigm and that traditional stocks need new metrics.The Dow was over 8000 at the time and the authors were calling for an immediate correction to 3000. As of this review it was almost 11,500 and the Nasdaq has more than doubled. I wonder if this guy is ever called upon as an expert anymore."
4,Cheap and Good,"Repeat order for my mother who suffers from skin disorder. Most soothing and safe products for her irritable skin. She goes for skin laser at National Skin centre to treat her skin disease thrice weekly. Her skin flaking and looks terrible, so far this is the only cream which is most suitable for her. She uses on her lips, head, hands and legs, in fact whole body. This is not available in SINGAPORE, so I have to order online for her regularly."
5,good product,"i use it on my baby, head to toe. She never had diaper rash or dry skin problem. recommend it!"
5,Love it,"My doctor told me to buy this for healing stitches, worked wonderful. Kept the stitches from being dried out and itchy."
1,NEVER RECEIVED THE CORRECT ORDER,"Aquaphor Healing Ointment, 14 oz (396 g) (Pack of 2)I placed an order and received Auaphor Baby Ointment. I was told not to return it. I requested a reorder and Baby ointment was delivered again.Again I was told oinments can not be returned. I requested a credit. I then received an Email stating I would not receive a credit unless the itm was returned. I am still waiting for a credit. I have been an Amazon customer for 10 years and this has been my worst experiece."
5,Bye Bye Dry Cracked Bleeding Skin,"The moment the temperature outside falls below 50 degrees, my hands and legs almost immediately get so dry they crack and start bleeding. I apply Aquafor and my skin heals literally overnight without multiple applications. True, Aquafor is a bit more expensive than its more well known competitors but after trying all those other lotions for extra dry skin, none of them even come close. The 2 tub pack is a real bargain."
3,Great stuff,Aquaphor is something that was recommended to me by my Dermatologist.I use it on everything from dry elbows to my lips. It is more like petroleum jelly and will soothe and heal any cracks or blisters (on the lips)
5,Dry Skin,"This is an excellent product for very, very dry skin. We have used it for a year and it has helped tremendously."
2,Forgettable,"It's not enough for characters or conversations to be ""like real life."" They have to reveal something. The first scene insists we are about to watch college friends go out into the world, then it sucker punches us with illogical and confusing flashbacks. I literally thought to myself every time one girl was onscreen ""why is she with these dorks instead of in Europe like the first scene promised us?"" Stagnant and pointless."
4,An informative travel guide,"This book contains everything you need to know about Burma: History, culture, sights plus a comprehensive ""Should you go?"" chapter. The only negative thing about the book is that it was too few pictures in it, making the book a bit boring. But still, I will highly recommend it for tourists and others going to Burma. And this book also get a star for being very up to date."
3,Jumbo Skillet,"Seems to be well-made but is still problematic in that you should use non-damaging utensils.....and they don't last OR work very well. Still, as today's skillets go this one is pretty good....and it didn't cost $100.00+!!!!"
5,Very descriptive,"EXCELLENT advice, lots of detailed pictures, and in-depth explanations. If you have a Mobile Home, old, or new. Or know someone who does, this is an excellent referance guide!"
4,INFORMATIVE BUT NOT DETAILED,"I found this book to be very informative with information about mobile homes.When it comes to ""how to do it"" it seemed to be lacking step by step details.If your a handyman and know the steps then you don't need the book.If your a novice at home repairs like me and need step by step details then you might have to figure out some things for yourself.I went on the net and watched ""how to"" videos along with the book and this was helpful for me."
1,Are you kidding?,"I have to give this one star just for the ridiculousness of the price ""1 new from $348.79""As one reader said its only good for homes over 25 years, well mine is and it would have been perfect for me if the price was 20 bucks or so!"
1,49$- 200$!!! For THIS book! YOU'RE CRAZY!,"49$- 200$!!! For THIS book! YOU'RE CRAZY! I read all of these reviews, and they seem to be written by the DB selling the book!This is my profile name below. Someone PLEASE tell me why this book is so expensive."
4,An emotional overload,"The first time I saw this movie on television I missed part of it, but from the strong storyline and thought provoking subject matter I knew I would have to see it in it's completion.Sidney Poitier does his usual outstanding acting and although I had never heard of Elizabeth Hartman before seeing this film , she stands out as what should have been an amazing rising star.If you like thought provoking films, I would recommend this one."
5,A Sensitive Recording,This is a very good early score from Jerry Goldsmith. It is very sensitive and reflective on the relationship of blind girl (Hartman) and black man (Poitier). Goldsmith received the 1965 Oscar nomination for this score. A good album.
3,Cookie cutter,"There is predictability to a great majority of Poitier's films. This film turned out to be just what I thought it would be. Wouldn't it be great if the world was color blind? Yes. I just think this film and even perhaps the story the film was based off on was trying too hard. There's no real character arches for the characters. They are the same people in the beginning of the film as in the end. So just the situation changes-Selina leaves her crazy guardians and goes to school. There were opportunities to go deeper and to take more risks-but this film, IMHO, played it safe (or safer) despite the controversial kiss and therefore didn't touch me as much as it could have."
3,Not Really Convinced..,"I absolutely love films from this time period, and Sidney Poitier is clearly one of the most versatile and gifted actors of our time. That said, I'm not really sure what to think about this film. The scenes with Shelley Winters were raw and captivating, but somehow Poitier and Hartman's characters were a little too simplistically acted and (I'm REALLY SORRY Mr. Poitier) almost melodramatic. Regardless, I was hooked and watched the entire film (the soundtrack is absolutely breathtaking) but I definitely cringed on a few of the scenes. Check out ""The Defiant Ones"" for a better performance."
2,completely destroys the book,"I've read the novel version of this story several times, and love it. The movie, when Ii first watched it, was touching, but there was something missing. On the second viewing, I realized what this film lacks is a convincing ending, the thing that makes the book so believable and heartbreaking. The shattering, tearful cliff-hanger of the novel was replaced by a simply, almost predictable, feel-good ending that makes the film flop miserably for someone who knows the original intent of the author. Also, the many scenes which were thought up by the film-makers, while convincing and poignant in their own way, don't compare with the warm, yet darkly sinister, tone of the book. I love the music though. And one question: is that Elizabeth Heartman's real voice?"
3,Sufficiently moving drama,"Guy Green's tale of the love between a blind girl and a ""coloured"" man is no masterpiece, but it is sustained by two touching performances by Sidney Poitier and Elizabeth Hartman. Other characters tend to be flatly sketched and poorly acted (so Shelley Winters), existing mainly to propel the merely adequate narrative. Nevertheless, in its own way this tale is affecting, and there are a few evidences here and there of some directorial flair. The film is scored by Jerry Goldsmith, whose music is enchantingly simple."
4,Blue Movie,"My year Ten class had to read and study this book, and I just loved it. When I found the movie starred the gorgeous Sidney Poitier, I was very excited.It is a great, great movie. It is quite slow-moving, but that only means it captures the emotions and intensity of the book brilliantly. (Not to mention the actors had some part in pulling this off!) Poitier and the young blind girl have fantastic chemistry. Though the two lead totally different lifestyles, they both know what it's like to live in a lonely, heartless world.This story really illustrates what real love is about - loving someone for their soul, and doing what is best for that person no matter how difficult it may be for both of you. It is cute but terribly sad when she noncholantly tells him that she's ""been done over.""One of my favourite old movies! Sidney Poitier - Schwing!"
4,Why remake it?????,"I really like this movie, it touched on an issue that for it's day was very controversial. Why in the world should this film be re-made if the first one was worth 5 stars????? I have found recently that re-makes of great old pictures are simply awful. What is the point, when video makes it possible to have all these wonderful old classics available for viewing any time?"
4,Snow doesn't know,"The man is brilliant. None of his songs can be ""overdone"", since there is infinite depth of emotiom within. This is material for any die-hard Neil fan. To say he over emotionalizes or does the gravelly groan is like telling a bride her dress is too fancy...it is not possible."
2,Also disappointed with live songs mixed in,"I just want to agree with other reviews that the live material is a disappointment. Great songs like Sweet Caroline, I Am..I Said and Cracklin' Rosie are live in Vegas-style arrangements.I credit Amazon with labeling the tracks thusly. When I bought this CD set years ago, I was unaware they weren't all the original hits.The non-live songs are great, but the live material left me cold. I'd rather have had the real greatest hits on this set, and bought a live album if I wanted one."
1,"Misleading Title--has live (aka ""trash"") and non-live (aka ""great"")","Do not be mislead by the title. Thankfully, Amazon let's us sample the songs on the CD and we find:(1) This CD has a great deal of ""live"" music on it,(2) It also has a great deal of non-live music on it, thus(3) It is a mixture of both.If you like him ""live""--which seems impossible and means you probably need to see a psychiatrist--then you'd be better off buying an all-live CD.If you like his studio music--you are sane!--do not purchase this."
1,Disappointment,"A major disappointment. Too many lame ""live"" versions of many classics. If you purchased this in a store, you will not know this until you get it home and open it as this is not noted anywhere on the outside of the package. Sorry I bought it, but I bought it long before Amazon."
1,Neil Diamond - The greatest HIts 1966-1992,I did not like the live versions of songs and would not have purchased it had I known that they were not studio recordings.
1,I agree - don't buy it,"So I'm not the only one who feels ripped off! I was so angry when I played this (on an excellent system and at a decent volume) and discovered that many of the tracks are (poor) live recordings. Like so many artists, he has passed his prime and his concert performances are but a pale imitation of the original recordings; and it is those original recordings his fans remember and expect.I was so angry I was tempted to write to Neil and complain. Unlike one of your unhappy reviewers, I did not even have the benefit of a sticker warning of the live tracks.If you're a real fan of the man, don't buy it."
2,Too Many Live Songs Not Identified by Amazon.com,"Starts out good with a clean, crisp version of Solitary Man and other great older stuff. The two songs I looked forward to the most were Cracklin' Rosie and Sweet Caroline - the major DISAPPOINTMENT was that these are live recordings. If there are two songs that shouldn't be live on a 'best-of', it's these. I am very displeased to be out [price] because Amazon did not identify which songs are live; I wouldn't have bought it. I should have read the other editorials. The ""Essential"" CD does indicate which recordings are live, and I would recommend that CD."
3,Buyer beware! (read on),"I was dissapointed with this collection. If all of the songs were the original studio versions, then I would have rated it 6 stars. Nah, make that 7. What went wrong? Thirteen (of 37) tracks are live, alas, alas, alas. This set wasn't cheap either. So, I'll have to go out and buy more CDs to get the original versions of my favorite Neil Diamond classics. Well, if I had known about the live versions on this one, I would have avoided it. Too bad. Looks like I'm still waiting for the ""ultimate collection."""
1,Ouch!,"This CD is not worth the money. Too many live cuts, and not good live cuts at all either! Neil can't sing live anymore like he used to!!! He can't hit some of the low notes anymore. All he manages to do is growl and yell a lot. The Very Best Of Neil Diamond is an excellent CD to get as there are no live recordings featured on that disc. Don't buy this!"
3,too many recorded live,"I agree with those who said there should have been a warning. ""Contains live recordings of many of these songs."" OK, i admit it, i should have read the reviews first, but Gee, i mean its Neil Diamond. he can't sing badly, I'm familiar with the songs, why would i need to read a review? I found out. To warn me that there are a lot of recorded live songs, with Neil being downright cheesy trying to pump up the crowd. i really didn't want to hear the pumped up crowd, thank you.That being said, it is Neil Diamond. he can't sing badly. well, not usually.All in all, the CDs were worth what i paid. Not quite the bargain i hoped for, but worth the money. They arrived in a timely manner, actually earlier than the date posted; in very good shape; I love the booklet included, with lyrics to all the songs, and notes on many. And, after all, it is Neil Diamond; The man sings like an angel."
3,Neither good nor bad,"The first eight tracks are mono versions of his early Bang Records recordings. Then eleven of the next thirteen tracks are live versions with ""Play Me"" and ""Song Sung Blue"" being re-recordings. In fact, nothing from 1968 through 1972 appears here in its original version which is disappointing since some of his best known songs came from this period. Next, all of ""12 Greatest Hits Vol. 2"" is repeated followed by his last major hit ""Heartlight"" and the synthesized ""Headed For The Future"". We then get a duet with Kim Carnes with their tepid rendition of Elvis' ""Heartbreak Hotel"" and a live version of a track from his '91 album ""Lovescape"".The collection as a whole isn't entirely bad but I would only recommend it to anyone who doesn't mind live versions of some of his songs. But if you're looking for a more comprehensive compilation with little or no live tracks then look elsewhere. Rating: 3.5 / 5 stars.TT Disc 1- 67:17 Disc 2- 73:07"
1,A great artist but too many Live tracks,"My husband is a big Neil Diamond fan and I was excited to give him this set for Christmas since it has So many great hits on it. Unfortunately, he has put it aside and asked for another collection by Neil Diamond. The problem is, there are way too many Live tracks on it to be enjoyable. The renditions he grew up with are not true to the sound he grew up with. Bummer!"
1,Did not know it was a concert series,"I love Neil Diamond! However, I would not have ordered this collection had I known it was a live in concert version. I thought it was a studio version. If you want his best work, please look at the description carefully and make sure you get the hits made in the studio. Tis hard to sing along with this CD, as he ab libs so much."
2,Early Mono hits only redeeming quality for two stars ...,"The Mono hits on the first disc were the only ones of any good on this CD with exception of ""America"" on the 2nd disc. I am very, very disappointed with Columbia for picking out live tracks for the other earlier songs such as ""Sweet Caroline"" and the tracks they picked - barf! Of all the live performances the man has done, why these? I go with others who have reviewed this as a poor production - buy the 20th Century one, it's a helluva lot better than this double set."
1,BEWARE! LIVE RECORDINGS!,"I was totally misled by the song line-up and the ""greatest hits"" claim on this dog. If you buy it you are going to be asking yourself, later, ""why didn't I read the reviews."" Almost every good song he ever did is represented by a live recording done with the pathetic audience singing along. Dear God! He isn't even in good voice on these tracks! and his vocals growl, and crack amidst the shoddy band strains which accompany him! Save yourself from the grief of having to return this stinker. I hope you read this before you make the same mistake I did. Otherwise, hey, there's one born every minute."
2,Bill Murray Covers Neil Diamond,"Having just seen the most wonderful Neil Diamond concert in Nashville the night before, I was anxious to relive the wonderful sound he created on stage so I rushed to purchase a CD. Wanting to get the max for my $'s, I purchased this CD. Big mistake.There are about 35 songs on the 2 CD's,13 of which are live performances, but very dated. All live recordings are poor, thin mixes and the words stray as you could imagen. They reminded me of Bill Murray's character on SNL, the lounge singer, covering Neil Diamond. For my money, stay with the original production quality recordings even if you have to purchase more than one cd."
3,"Great selections, but 2 disappointments:","I commend Neil Diamond's enormously successful 30 year career, and this CD certainly contains quite a bit of his material. However, I don't understand why Columbia reproduced the earlier hits, such as ""Thank The Lord For The Nighttime"" and others, in monoral. I know there are stereo recordings available, as my Father has some of his original records from the orange ""Bang Records"" label, and all recordings (except for ""Solitary Man"") were in true stereo. I say ""true"" stereo, meaning the effect of 3 dimensional sound distribution. I'm not refering to music in the 1960's that used to be recorded as music in one channel, and singing in the other.My other disappointment is that there is no indication on the front or back cover that this album contains live recordings. I am neither a ""Live"" or a ""Monoral"" fan. Had I known of these two issues, I would not have purchased this CD."
3,Save Your Money,Why does Columbia keep doing this. You look at the back of the album and you see great songs. You buy the album and once to you get to the live songs you vomit. If you get nothing out of this review understand this the origianol studio recordings can never ever be substituted and not to mention the price is terrible for the quality you get
2,"not deceived, just not thinking.....","I agree with some of the other reviews. I too didn't care for the live versions. Then again, I assumed I was getting the original recordings, without doing myself a favor and reading the reviews by those listed here on Amazon. Shame on me. I've given this one away, and now am hunting for a compilation of the original studio stuff."
1,Buy the box set,"The live versions of the UNI years are auful, which happen to be his best songs imho! This ""greatest hits"" is anything but that! Skip this one. While a huge fan of ND, the live versions on this CD sound awful do to his voice being ravaged from years of heavy smoking. Too bad. Buy the box set for all this hit in one place plus many cool songs that never made it to the albums. Scotch on the Rocks is a cool song that turned into Love on the Rocks. There is a nifty little ditty that has a typewriter instead of a drum keeping the rhythm. Skip this set and go for the box set In My Lifetime. Worth the cash! And also Hot August Night. A true milestone in Neil Diamond's long career."
1,Neil Diamond's Wayne Newton impression,"I love Neil Diamond's classic songs, but this collection of tired Vegas show style remakes is not worth the time or the money. Considering the material, this is a shameful waste, bordering on a travesty."
2,Niel Diamond greatest hits,Didnt realize that they were mostly recordings from live concerts. I prefer just him singing 1966-1992
5,WHAT A TREAT,"Until I bought this album, I forgot how much I love Neil Diamond. Listening brings back memories of seeing him in person at Madison Square Garden and being blown away by his voice. There's lot to like in the selections and there are so many, you don't feel like you're cheating when you skip a couple of the less well-known ones. I heartily recommend it."
5,FABULOUS DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH,"IF YOU EVER WANTED TO GET NEIL DIAMOND'S BEST SONGS IN ONE TAPE, THIS IS THE ONE TO GET!!!!"
5,Just the greatest!,"I have every one of Neil Diamonds C D.s and I play them every night when I go to bed, to me he is just Fantastic, and having seen him in many concerts I can only say he is MAGIC, for me and I could never get tired of listening to him and watching him. Sheer heaven, and the sexiest 61 year old on the scene."
3,"Diamond shines, but doesn't dazzle!","When I was a 12 year old boy, somebody bought me a double vinyl album by Neil Diamond called 'Diamonds'. I loved it and played it to death.20 years later I suddenly got the urge to hear those great songs again and scoured the amazon sites. Alas 'Diamonds' isn't mentioned anywhere so I settled for this CD instead.Imagine my horror when I played it and half the tracks were live versions (and weak ones at that!) I believe a live concert of your favourite artist is a great experience - when you are actually there - but rarely translates well to record.The beautifully arranged orchestrations are replaced by a band and the soulful voice is replaced by the weaker, less tuneful live version, with applause and Neils comments to the audience thrown in for good measure!The non-live songs are all excellent and he is a terrific singer - I just wish I could have had my 'Diamonds' back!"
3,Excellent collection spoilt by mediocre live versions,"I bought this compilation after looking thru the track-listing and seeing that all my favourite Neil Diamond songs were included. Unfortunately 13 of the songs are mediocre live versions from Neil's early 90s concerts. Classics such as Cracklin' Rosie, I Am I Said, Song Sung Blue and Sweet Caroline are poor imitations of the original studio recordings of the early 70s. I recommend that you get your hands on the Neil Diamond Collection if you want to listen to these and others in their full glory. Clearly, Uni who own the rights to these songs didn't give permission to Columbia for them to be included on these CDs. So until all these songs are released on a single collection, you will have to do what I did, buy both and make your own compilation. Not cheap, but worth it for the ultimate Neil Diamond collection."
4,"Some dubious live acts, unfortunately...","At first glance this compilation is a sure winner. What the cover doesn't state, however, is that many of the tracks are live recordings. Although many of Neil Diamond's songs benefit from a live performance, for instance, Brooklyn Roads and Cracklin' Rosie, others are seriously unpalatable, having the unfortunate effect of severely marring my impression of Diamond.I will never comprehend why the original Song Sung Blue was jettisoned in favour of a gruff, raspy update that is an insult to the original. In addition, Diamond has a tendency to overpower the material during live acts, dragging and drawling all over the place. An example of which is the badly burnt 'Play Me'. The relative restraint shown in the studio recordings work far better.For all that, however, I can't say this 2-CD set was a poor purchase, but it could have been improved with more careful screening during the song selection process."
2,"wait for his ""real"" Greatest Hits!","I so agree with most people here. The live songs are so bad... I am writing this in Oct. 2005, having just returned from his live concert in Atlanta. After hearing this CD, I was reluctant to even go to his concert, but am happy to report he did a great job in it. He sang well and was fairly true to the records. And as for the first disc records not being in stereo., I knew they sounded weak but didn't realize why til I read these."
3,Too Many (Cheesy) Live Cuts,"I was thrilled to get this CD, and like many other reviewers, was ultimately dissapointed to discover that many of the songs on the first disc were live versions, and not very good live versions at that. Some of the original cuts were great (as always), but it should be mentioned on the CD case that many tracks are live. . . that's certainly not what I wanted when I bought this! A decent compilation, but if you really want pure Neil, stick to the original albums/recordings."
2,Disappointed,"While I love Neil Diamond's music, there was nothing that I saw, to indicate that most of the songs on this album were recorded live. Now that is not necessarily bad, but in this instance he yelled the songs rather than singing them and there is LOTS of croud noise! What I was looking for were the original studio recordings."
2,Neil Diamond's greatest Hits,"Don't get this record if you really liked Neil Diamond. The ""LIVE CONCERT versions of his songs SUCK!!!"" I really hated wasting my money on this CD.I wish I could give it back!!!"
2,Live versions of his great music are poor,"Neil is a great writer and a good singer, but he apparently needs the help of a studio to sound excellent. This set is nearly all live versions, and Neil, unfortunately, ""reads"" the lyrics. I was really disappointed with it. Gotta buy another collection to get the original versions."
2,Live Recordings? Yes they are!,"As everyone else stated, they were shocked to find out some of the songs on this CD are LIVE.I too was shocked and didn't read the reviews before purchasing this CD.I've seen Neil Diamond in concert a few times, but I wanted his hits all together on one CD with regular studio versions.This is not the case with the CD.Some of my favorite Studio songs are:ShiloSoolaimonBrother Love's Traveling Salvation ShowShilo sounded ""different."" This sounded like an alternate version recorded or it was RE-recorded.The other two lose something when recorded live unless you are there at the concert.Skip this CD and go for the original greatest hits CDs, even if you have to buy a few separate ones."
1,Extremely disappointed,"All of my favorite songs on this cd (Cracklin' Rosie, Sweet Caroline, etc.) are live versions, and they are terrible. I was looking for a CD that the whole family could sing along to. This is not it. Try another Neil Diamond collection. This is the pits."
3,Version is everything!,This album has all the hits as promised but some of them are not exactly what I hoped for - some of the best songs like Cracklin' Rosie are live versions in which the audience does more singing than ND. I was a little disappointed.
2,Don't get tricked like I did,"Buyer beware! I used to own this album -- got it through a CD club, but returned it. After purchase, I discovered, to my dismay, that some of the songs were not the original versions but live versions instead. There was no indication that these were ""remakes"" on the cover. Deception! Why, oh why, do the powers that be feel compelled to keep including these live versions of some songs on all of Neil's ""greatest hits"" type albums? If I wanted live versions of his songs, I'd buy a live album. (I'm not a big fan of live albums as a rule anyway. Give me the studio versions!) I haven't yet been able to find a compilation of Neil's wonderful work that includes all original versions of all the songs on one album. I'm still waiting, Neil ..."
1,Know What is in Store!,"While I am not a huge Neil Diamond fan, I recognize his skill as a songwriter and performer, and I was looking forward to listening to a collection of all his great songs.How surprised, and disappointed I was when song after song was a live recording, not the original track that I expected to hear based on the ""greatest hits"" packaging! How much I would have loved to have heard the original ""Red Red Wine"" and not a cheap cover of the reggae cover of his own song!Just writing about this disc makes me mad. Neil, send us your original tracks, keep the rest for yourself!"
1,Too many live songs,"I was not very happy with this CD. Most of the sing along favorites are live, and sound pretty far off from the original. Neil went a little ""too crazy"" mixing up these songs on stage, and for me ruined the song. Sweet Caroline, Cracklin Rosie, Song Sung Blue and others. I was pretty disappointed after listening to it the first time."
2,Too many live tracks,"If I had known the number of live tracks, I would not have purchased this CD. I have learned a lesson though: check the reviews before buying the CD!"
4,Neil the Greatest,"Once I received this 2 disk collection, I didn't want to turn it off. Of course some of the songs I didn't care for but the majority were fantastic. Well worth the money........"
5,Great!,"I use this to make biscuits for my dog, he loves them so I guess this stuff is pretty good! This is the 2nd time I've ordered from this company and I'm very happy with them."
3,A bit too strong. I use it for cooking.,"Really does make breads, biscuits, and soups taste better. Just too strong for me to use daily. Easy way to give a vitamin B boost to my family, as we make our own bread weekly.I bought it to boost my vitamin B and digestion though. Its not working out for that so much. Its a strong nutty/ almost bouillon like taste though. Not something I would put into a smoothie."
2,Broke out,"I bought this to make lactation cookies as I had heard this helps with milk production while nursing. I also bought this to put in yogurt or other items to help me boost my milk supply. It did help me increase my milk supply, however, it came at a cost. I broke out in rashes while using this. I assume I must be allergic to it or something. As soon as I stopped using this my rashes went away and have not come back. So it may be helpful to some to boost health or milk supply but just be aware that there is a possible risk of reaction to those who may be more sensitive."
2,"May be good or may be bad, how to tell?","Thanks Dr. Oz for making us feel that brewer's yeast is really necessary for our health. Just like krill oil and vitamin E. Couldn't tell the difference with or without. However, was a wee bit constipated and things sorta worked out so there was so benefit after all. I'll let the brewers make that call."
4,A fun history to read,"McCurdy explores the space age by explaining its relationship to popular culture. He explains how and why public opinion shaped the space age, as well as how the space age shaped public opinion. Plus he examines how American history, both real and romanticized, shaped our culture. He makes many references to literature, television, and movies, making it a book everyone can relate to at least a little bit. I would have given it 5 stars, but he does go off subject sometimes and leaves you not quite sure where he's going."
5,Sunbursted! Made in China! NOT AUSTRALIA!,"I absolutely love these boots. I am a 10 and ordered a 9 and they are perfect. They are a sleeker and narrower fit than the original styles.The only thing that disappointed me about these AUSTRALIAN BOOTS was the MADE IN CHINA sticker on the bottom of the boot....other than that, they are just great!"
3,size come smaller than I expect,"I own a children size 5 of this boots so I figured Women size 6 will be a perfect, however the boots barely fit which makes me wonder how could the smaller kid size fits better than the adult size?"
5,Ugg Boots are wonderful,"I needed a pair of warm winter boots since we moved to canada and someone suggested Ugg. The price seemed a little high to me before I purchased them, but decided to take the plunge and see if they were worth it. I must say that they are worth every penny. Very warm and cushy on the inside. Stylish on the outside and get even better as they get broken in and have a little ""worn"" look to them. I love my Ugg's"
4,great for it's time.,"This cd is getting a bad rap - I feel that it is being compared to the new ""Buffy"". The Buffy's were different times, so the music is going to be different. In 1992 the music on this CD is what people were listening to. The C&C Music Factory were huge around that time. The Dream Warriors were massively popular in their home country of Canada. Susanna Hoffs was trying to make a comeback. And then you've got your classic artists such as Matthew Sweet and Toad The Wet Sprocket. Great CD for it's time. Some of the songs are garbage though (the Rob Halford track sticking out the most), and some of 'em are great (hey, I hate metal, but I quite enjoy the Ozzy Osbourne track - don't ask). If you loved the movie, you may enjoy the cd as well."
2,boring,"I almost fell asleep listening to this CD. The only song worth listening was ""party with the animals"" with ozzy."
2,Great Cover,"Susanna Hoffs (lead singer of the bangles) gives a brilliant cover of Oingo Boingo's ""We Close our eyes"" in this album, apart from that it's a fairly average soundtrack.I would only suggest this if you enjoy the movie."
3,Come on,The cover looked like it had been ren over. It was cracked to beat he::but the CD its self dose still play.
2,carlape@yahoo.com,Hey this CD sucks you should change it for the one in the TV that music it's so cool change this old but very old CD for the NEW ONE when I hear this CD makes me feel sick.
2,"1 awesome track, 2 decent, but other than that, crap","I hate rap and pop music, and much of the other stuff is too mellow for me. But I do enjoy the Cult's song, and I am a pretty big Ozzy fan as well. But the song that really makes this album shine is closing number ""Light Comes Out Of Black"" by the metalgod himself, Rob Halford. The song is very reminiscent of Priest in their Painkiller era. Overall, get this, burn the Halford song onto a CD, then sell it."
5,Defining a bit of the undefinable,"This week the state in which I live, Nevada, executed someone. Was he guilty? Probably, he was found guilty in a trial and then confessed. After some twelve yers on death row he quit appealing and asked to be executed. The comment of the children of the lady he killed were reported by the news as being thankful that justice had been served and closure brought to the situation. Today in the paper there are several articles wanting other people on death row to be executed.Is this justice? Is it justice if the people executed are largely poor, minority and male? Or do the poor, minority males commit more crimes?These and many other points about justice do not have easy answers. This little book attempts to present a theory of justice that covers these and many other points. In defining justice he discusses deserving, reciprocity, equality, and the philosophy of what has defined justice down through the years.Excellently written, this is a book that makes you think."
3,Interesting perspective but sometimes far fetched,"A different and valuable analysis of Elvis Presley presenting the basis for his behavior in later life. I found a great deal of it plausible and very helpful in my understanding of the man. However, much of the reasoning seemed contorted and overextended with rambling, sometimes disjointed and overworked passages. It was like listening to Allen Greenspan before a congressional committee. I felt that the author made some conflicting statements. Most difficult for me to accept was the degree to which Elvis's life was supposedly shaped by the death of his twin at birth. But then I'm no psychologist."
3,Southern Christmas Literary Classics of the Holidays,Interesting stories. This is a nice book to pick up for a short read. I like the bios of the authors.
4,Great Introduction to Southern Authors' Writings about Christmas,"I enjoyed this book very much. It is a concise introduction to serious and noteworthy southern authors of Pulitzer Prize-winning standing and some of their writings where Christmas plays a role in the plot or as a backdrop. It consists of short stories, poems and excerpts from novels. Reading this anthology made me want to explore the author's other works both Christmas-related and not. It is worth mentioning that most of these stories are not 'light' feel-good Christmas 'fluff'... these are Christmas stories of the south, and many deal with race-relations, being poor and what is was like to be African-American growing up south of the Mason-Dixon line. I recommed this book to anyone who'd enjoy reading a bit of 'hard reality' and historical writing during the holiday season."
5,Wonderful hand soap!,"Have never gotten too excited over hand soap before but this one is fabulous. Bought a regular sized bottle and quickly ordered a refill because it's going so fast and don't want to run out even for a day! It has a very subtle scent - earthy, olive-y, but not overwhelming. Also cleans & rinses off your hands completely -- no feeling of soapy residue or need to rinse & rinse & rinse to achieve that like some other liquid soaps. I also recommend the hand lotion in this scent -- perfect partner -- again not too overwhelming of a scent."
2,not so great.,"I had read about these in a European magazine. Thinking all things European are better and suddenly getting a cold sore just when I didn't want it, I rush ordered it. I've tried a lot of different cold sore remedies. This has to be the weirdest. It's like a band-aid. They are by no means invisible. In fact they drew more attention to it than if I hadn't used it at all. Hmmmmm......"
1,Fell for him the first time.....,....but not this time. When she checks into the hotel and sees the picture by famed photog Robert Kincaid I suddenly needed a shower. Yuck.....
3,"Not Bridges, but OK","I love the down to earth style of the author. If you like it, you'll like Hemenway and Agori (Defenders of the Holy Grail) but it is not TRYING so hard to be intellectual. Does life have to be complicated? True emotions run deep. This book is worth it."
1,Bridges without the benift of 2 great stars,"Immature, second rate writting. If they make a movie of this the scenery will be good, but I can only hope they get someone better to write the dialogue. Incidently only someone who would use irregardless would swoon over this book."
1,What a disappointment!,"Having read ""Bridges"", I would never imagine Waller would be a one-hit-wonder. I still hope it is not the case.I can only say ""Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend"" is a cup of lukewarm water.I was surprised and disappointed."
4,We need to have more of this type of love story.,"Robert James Waller needs to continuously write more of these love stories. 'Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend' is another good, believable story. It's too bad some critics can't recognize a truly good writer."
3,"Only 50,000 words, thank God!","This is a simple story of love and lust, told without using big words or graphic sexual descriptions. A child of twelve could read it and write a book report in about four hours, and never have to think too hard. He/she might wonder why grownups in the story were acting like teenage Romeo and Juliet, but other than that, it holds no surprises. Good clean fun for a short airplane ride or a rainy day on vacation.Charlie"
2,Predictable,"This is the sort of book you'd take on a 2-hour plane flight. Mildly distracting, completely predictable, ""fiction lite."" I'll give it a little credit for depicting ""mature"" people rather than 20somethings in a tangled love/lust affair, but overall it's something to read and forget. Michael Tillman is the perfect romantic hero--a loner, intelligent, slightly rebellious within the system, an animal lover, a biker, lean and comfortable in his jeans and disdain for the academic life. His object of desire, Jellie Braden, is beautiful (of course) with lovely legs, hair, and other assets, and in possession of a mysterious and exotic past that only increases her allure for a ""rebel"" like Tillman. *Sigh* Really, who couldn't see the ending coming about five miles away? Don't expect great literature here."
3,Middle aged love and intimacy,"Michael Tillman, a maverick middle-aged economics professor meets his future lover, Jellie Braden, another professor's wife, at a party. Together they find the passion they both have been searching for, and, along with it, the pain of choices and loss and a searching that takes them half way around the world. This is an intimate look at their special relationship."
3,Screwed to tight,The 51 case is very large with plenty of room to work in. Adjustable feet for multiple sized mobo's. My video card temp drop from 67 c idle to 42 along with all other temps.Sturdy case with though plastic side panel cracked when picked it up. Due to over tighten fan screws. Major dishonesty is the 480 watt power supply. Its a constant 330 watt 480 max meaning if you hit the 400 watt it'll be dead in a few weeks. Though for $40 its not a complete waste. If you buy make sure you unscrew the side fan a little.
4,Incredible,"Dalbello has an unbelievable voice and presence. I have only recently heard this album, and it is very difficult to come by for some reason. Dalbello should be a name everyone knows. The best songs on this album are Whore and Eleven. Both INCREDIBLE."
1,not worth the money,"I bought this cd player expecting the usually good quality I receive from target's merchandise. Not this time. First time I used it,it skipped all the time. The second time I used it,it played for maybe five minutes and then I got a DISC error message and no play. Third time the thing just would not play. I am very dissappointed and will be returning this item.Mary Laing"
4,Nerdcore standup,"I bumped into some of this artist's humor on Youtube, decided I wanted to hear more, and bought the CD.If you're a geek and were a child of the 80's, and humor directed at those two facets of your personality amuses you, buy this CD. Support this guy, so he can make more and better stuff.Three stars for humor and quotability, and one more star for being a rare example of a rare genre. He's pretty darn cool now, but he's not Airwolf yet."
5,Secrets of Successful Actors,"This is a great book for people interested in acting and don't know where to start. It is written in a language that is easy to understand.This book takes you step by step, from just starting out to being an established actor. I would recommend this for all aspirating actors and actresses."
4,A Fun Reading Exercise For Youngsters,"Margaret Hillert takes the wonderful story of Cinderella and compacts it into a short story that's easy for eager youngsters to read. This book uses primer words such as ""to,"" ""we,"" ""help,"" and ""see,"" in a repetitive fashion that gives beginning readers an excellent drill in reading. The book also features colorful illustrations by Janet LaSalle. Children over the age of seven may find this book to be rather dull, but younger readers will be encouraged by the fact that they can read a book in its entirety.This book is part of the Modern Curriculum Press Beginning To Read Series and I highly recommend it to any parent who has a young bookworm just waiting for something else to read. It's a fun story put forth in an easily digestable format for the kiddies."
5,Cinderella At The Ball by Margaret Hillert,Another Margaret Hillert fairy tale for the beginning reader. Great for building confidence by reading a story that is already familiar.
4,Descendent of Roger Chandler,"As I am a descendent of Roger Chandler, I was especially interested in the genealogy. It did the job to verify that I truly am a descendent."
3,A Mom,"Cute, but it absolutely TERRIFIED my 4 year old. I couldn't even finish reading it; he made me stop. I had to sit in his room with him until he fell asleep because he was so scared. A word to the wise, be sure your child is not afraid of ""boogey men"", or other things that may be lurking in the dark before taking this book out at bedtime!!! If they're not afraid now, they will be after reading this book. Definitely a better read for an older child."
1,Ughhhh!,"Both of my oldest kids had to read this in 1st grade as part of the K12 virtual academy for 1st grade. First of all, they hated the story and wanted to give up reading it long before they got to the spanking threat part. It is long, annoying and boring aside from the fact that voilence is threated against the child. Classic or not, it is unacceptable for me."
2,"smoking, spanking and watching TV?","I loved the Frances books as a child, so I bought this one for my niece without even opening it. When we sat down to read it, I was horrified. ""Father"" smokes a pipe, both parents watch television, and Frances is threatened with a spanking if she doesn't go to sleep even though she's afraid of monsters in the dark. The book is supposed to help children conquer their fears of the night and sleeping alone but there must be better ways to achieve this. Try the other Frances books, they're great."
2,"Introduces fear of the dark, procrastination methods and spanking, with nice pictures","Frances is a sweet character, but this book is more likely to terrify than calm your child. We haven't had to deal with fear of mysterious shapes in the dark yet with our 3-year-old, so I'm certainly not going to introduce the concept, or suggest that cracks are scary because things with lots of legs might come out of them. The book also shows bedtime procrastination as normal and quite effective (would you give your child an extra piece of cake for getting out of bed?) And yes, spanking is bad. If you have an older child who already has all these fears, you have my sympathy and perhaps this book would be appropriate."
3,Spanking?,I think it is a alright book however by the and if the book the parents have told frances to go back in her room so many times he is now thretening to spank her. I dont think this is somthing I want my daughter to think is going to happen we have red it to her and skip the last 2 pages. I dont think it is the best book for bedtime at all.
1,"I read lots of not ""politically correct"" stories to my kids","I read *lots* of not ""politically correct"" books to my child but not this one, b/c of the ""spanking issue"". It is not at all obvious to me - as an adult - that the father would not really spank her as one reviewer suggests.For some kids these may be ploys to stay up but for many night-fears are very real. I would not want to introduce more fears (spiders, etc.) for a child sensitive on this issue. I don't think it wd/ help a child over-come them either. (I don't read any of Rosemary Well's ""unready"" books as I don't want to introduce issues but I think they cd/ help someone overcome them.)It's not just that this book was written years ago, it is that it seems to have been written without kids in mind. My daughter would not laugh at the mention of spanking!"
1,Hate to say it....,"but, I have to agree with the person who talked about the spanking in this book. It is a bit too much...also, afraid to encourage my child with new ways to avoid bedtime."
1,Not thrilled,"I was hoping for a story that would help to paint a lovley picture of bedtime from a child's stand point. This book only succeeded in spelling out some lovely ways that children can make it exasperating for themselves and their parents.Very disappointing, given that Bread and Jam for Frances is one of our family favorites."
4,Trials at Bedtime,Frances is a charming little badger who taxes her mother'spatience with her bedtime routine. Easily understood by young children.
1,Warning!,"This collection leads off with the episode entitled ""Santa's Missing Cap"" in which Hello Kitty's father reveals to Kitty and Mimi that he and their mommy really give the presents, not Santa, and that Santa is not really what they believe him to be. Check out the reviews on this separate video title!The only other Kitty story is ""My Mother Loves Me After All"", which is not a Christmas story. The other stories feature the other Sanrio characters."
3,It's Okay...,"The arrangements are a bit cheesy. Missing the Alma Mater and Alma Mater Parody. Missing Sandy or Alone at the Drive In. Has You're the One That I Want (instead of All Choked Up). If you're doing the School Version, the songs with vocals have the original lyrics (which are not always school appropriate)."
4,Masterful recreation of the family of a restored plantation,"Kibler brings back a slice of the Old South with detailed research and rich, descriptive narrative. Some may accuse him of romanticizing but recent scholarship places him much closer to reality. The Hardy's (the original family of the home Kibler himself restored) while atypical of the prosperity of the larger South are representative of their class. A good read & highly recommended."
5,Award Winning Book,"I have already written a review but I felt that anyone interested should be aware that this book received a reward in Nashville, Tennessee on April 16, 1999 for outstanding work in non-fiction. Dr. Kibler is the first South Carolinian ever to receive this award."
5,Great classic 70's pop-rock band and radio staple!,"Excellent CD full of 3DN's most notable pop tunes, and great ones at that! They were a prolific 'hit machine' that helped define 70's radio, and bring back great memories of that era. Excellent songwriting skills and songs that truly stand the test of time, since their songs sound just as good today. This CD should, without question, be in your collection of all-time great pop-rock bands."
4,A MUST-HAVE EVEN FOR HARDCORE 3DN FANS!,"I grabbed this disc recently for a road trip even though I have eight Three Dog Night studio albums on CD. I was pleasantly surprised to discover that it contains a couple of impossible-to-find single mixes: ""Joy to the World"" and ""Liar"". These are the original 45 versions, noticably tougher than the LP versions, and with some vintage '70s edits! Recommended, then, for those in search of a primer, or for completionists."
5,I'm now a Three Dog Night fan!,"My father baught this CD five days ago, and ever since I have listened to nothing else. I had heard all of the songs before I first listened to it, and most of them shocked me because I didn't even know that they were Three Dog Night songs. I recommend this CD to any Rock/Classic Rock fan...you won't regret buying this CD!"
5,the best,all i was after was j.was a bullfrog.so i suffer(joke) through the greatest hits again.the joke is that i rate three dog night in the top three .so another hits album is vbery o.k.
4,"One of those ""you had to be there"" Cds","Most people who like this will do so largely because of nostalgia. If you were around in the 70s, you will have fond memories of this stuff. Tunes like their version of ""Easy to Be Hard,"" ""Black and White"" (presaging Paul and Stevie's ""Ebony and Ivory"" by a decade or so), ""One "" (is the lonliest number) etc. will bring bliss to seventies children (and teenagers and college kids), but will probably sound overwrought and corny to everyone else. BTW, what the HECK does ""Jeremiah was a bullfrog"" mean?"
2,Sound isn't so great,Don't be fooled by the title. These 20th Century Masters CDs are not remastered.I knew that before I purchased The Best of Three Dog Night. Yet I still expected the CD to sound better than it does.
1,"Half-baked ""Night""","There's nothing wrong with the music here--what little there is of it. This CD earns its one-star rating for being a random selection of HALF of Three Dog Night's hits, thrown together as quickly and as cheaply as possible in a crass attempt to cash in on the ""millennium"" craze. If you want a single-disc collection of Three Dog Night's hits, pick up the similarly-titled ""Best of Three Dog Night"" (the one with three colorized close-up photos against a white background) instead. For just a couple of dollars more, you'll get all of TDN's hits except ""'Til The World Ends."""
3,"not bad, but comes up short of hits.","I've been collecting these ""20th Century Masters"" collections since their debut in 1999 and over all they're a decent overview of each artist's career, but if an artist or group had more than ten hits(or recorded for multiple labels besides one under the Universal umbrella), than these discs can come up missing a few songs. Three Dog Night, for example, had 21 top 40 singles(on the ABC/Dunhill label) from 1969-1974 but only 12 of them could be included on this budget-priced ""best-of"". So no room for ""Family of Man"", ""Out In the Country"" or ""Pieces of April"" and other lower-charting singles. For only a few dollars more I'd recomend the just-released ""Complete Hit Singles"" collection that includes all 21 of their greatest hits on one disc(plus a great booklet with liner notes and photos)."
3,There is more and better,"My rating of this album speaks ONLY of what is included here; not the band. No ""Family of Man"", or ""Sure as I'm Sitting Here"" or ""Out in the Country"", for starters.""The Best of Three Dog Night"" gives half again as many songs (20!), and has much more of their great work."
3,"Great tunes, but lacking","This disc has some great tunes, as everything Three Dog Night touched turned to gold, but there is a much wider variety of masterpieces that these guys did. Get theCelebrate: The Three Dog Night Story, 1965-1975set, with two CDs worth of great material."
3,A Mediocre Hits Collection By One Of The 70's Best Groups.,"This millinium collection contains a number of the group's hits, but some of them are only in mono. There's no excuse for MCA to put out mono recordings when the stereo ones are available. Stick with the single disc called ""The Best of Three Dog Night"". You not only get the stereo versions, but more hits as well! Also, I agree with the above reviewer that MCA is only trying to get the last dime out of customers by offering these millinium recordings."
1,Broken right out of the box,"Do not do not do NOT buy this product or any products from this manufacturer. Once I put the batteries in the vibrator it did vibrate for about thirty seconds but then I started smelling an electrical smokey smell and I removed all the components to determine the source of the smoke. The adapter now will not even go back in the receptor. This is the most ridiculous waste of money I have ever fallen for. And since I opened the box, I am not allowed to return or exchange it, even if it is damaged. They say they are happy to take back ""damaged"" items, BUT TELL ME, HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO KNOW IT'S DAMAGED IF YOU CAN'T EVEN OPEN THE BOX???? Don't do it! This product is a lemon."
2,Big Disappointment,"The rotating pearls do not do anything for you, the rotation of the shaft is over-rated, but the biggest disappointment here is the vibrating bunny isn't strong enough for climax, leaving frustration. Also, a better name may be Dust Bunny, as it does not stay clean and dirties within seconds of dust particles, animal dander, etc."
2,Don't Believe the Hype,All I hear is Rabbit this and Rabbit that. This thing is overrated. The vibrating rabbit feels good but the whole device leaves a lot to be desired. And the rotating shaft?... worthless. It does nothing for you and the motor is not strong enough to keep it turning at a constant enough pace... Don't waste your money.
5,I bought a size 3. Shoulda got one size smaller!,"the quality is VERY good. I purchased this for a costume, but you can easily use this for real kung fu or tai shi. I'm a 28"" waist and that portion fits fine, however it can expand a good amount. I'm about 29"" inseam and it was a bit long for me."
3,Elastic Problems,"The cotton of the pants is good quality. The pants themselves are good quality. However, the elastic around the waist I found way too tight, even though the pants fit well otherwise. I gave my pair to my husband because he could deal with the tightness around the waist. But then, as he wore them, the elastic at the ankles completely gave up the ghost after just a couple of washings. A case of ""too much and too little."" I wouldn't buy this product again."
1,keep shopping,"Oh dear, don't like these at all, very uncomfortable, looks like one is wearing a diaper under them, I'm used to wearing martial arts clothing and these are the worst I've ever worn, I tried washing them to loosen them up a bit but no luck, they will end up at the thrift store :("
4,ground level,"If you are a lover of good music and revel in the oppurtunity to be the first to be listening to a soon to be big group, then buy this cd. Get in on the ground level with this new band. This album, tiller paul's debut, is quality. I have heard them play a few times since this release and they continue to impress me. They are a great live show so if you are in the myrtle beach area you need to look them up. Look for their next album as well as ""flicker"" because this band gets better and better. When you do buy this CD, check for tracks 1-4,9,11,12, and hidden. These are just a few of my favorites on the disk."
1,"""This movie is dumb""","My title is the quote from a young girl watching this movie. She stopped after about 10 minutes and complained that all it was was ""some guy talking to a cloud"".We all know this trashware is intended to suck in people ignorance of the fact it's not Pixar's Brave, but even taken by itself apparently it's terrible, too. The child couldn't be bothered to continue."
1,I was fooled!,"I have to laugh at myself for completely falling for the trick that this movie was the recent Disney movie ""Brave"". It is truly awful and completely bizarre. I am disappointed that I have contributed to the revenue of this film. We turned it off after about twenty confusing minutes. The trailer for ""Puss n' Boots"", with William Shatner as the title character (which looks just about as bad as this movie) should have tipped me off as to what was to come."
1,"Awful, waste of your time and money","We didn't enjoy this movie at all. At first glance I thought this movie was somehow related to a recent Disney movie. Not that I expected that but thought it was just a bonus. I was wrong. This movie is in no way related to the Disney movie, and it's not as good as the Disney movie.This movie was absolutely horrible. There were no redeeming qualities or parts. We actually stopped the movie before it was over because it was just that bad.Coco's thoughts"": ""Bo-ring!""If you'd like to give this movie a try, I suggest you rent it from Redbox first, before you pay full price.Reviewed for Arms of a Sister blog"
1,This movie is possibly the worst ever.,This movie is extremely boring. It does not make any sense. People who buy it should be given money for having to watch it. DO NOT GET THIS!
1,WORST KIDS MOVIE EVER,"Do not rent, let alone purchase, this movie that is obviously trying to cash in on the Disney flick of nearly the same name and cover image. This terrible movie makes no sense and is not appropriate for kids or anyone with a sense of taste. You would be hard-pressed to find a movie anywhere that's worse this. Yuck!"
1,Terrible,"I bought this movie for my niece Ciara because it was supposed to be about a princess named Kiara. It was terrible! I didn't even watch the whole thing before we turned it off. I wish you could get a refund for a movie being so bad! In my opinion, it wasn't even a good ""kids"" movie, it had a lot of weird characters, violence, and poor decisions."
1,Worst movie I have ever taken the time to watch even part of.,I wasted 40 minutes of my life on this. My 12 year old sister even asked to change it and she'll watch almost anything. This was the worst thing I've ever taken any time to watch
1,Had to stop watching it was so bad,"Well, not proud of myself but I rent this movie on Redbox thinking it was the new Disney movie...Well, it was obvious at the first scene it was not the new Disney but I thought well, for $1, let's give it a try. After 5 minutes of torture, I decided it was enough and my girls did not even complain, just to let you know how bad it was...AVOID at any price!"
1,Avoid if you can...,"Picked this up as a new release at Redbox. Clearly this company is trying to front-run major theatrical release.I was not under the impression that this would be like Pixar's ""Brave"". However, it's not even worthy of home entertainment.... Regardless of the $1.00 rental cost."
1,Horrible!,"Not even my 6 year old could finish this horrible movie! Not worth the 1.30 redbox fee. The obvious deceitfulness of the production company is appalling, capitalizing on the release of Disneys Brave. Don't waste your time, trust me."
1,DO NOT Rent or Buy this movie -- HORRIBLE is a Compliment,"DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!This movie is not even worth the $1 rental from Redbox. It is not even about Kiara the BRAVE and was only called this to take advantage of the Disney Pixar release of BRAVE. This movie is about a boy named Super Cloud born from a cauldron of Bat wings, bugs, slime, and other ""gross"" things. It is not for little girls! It is the worse movie ever made and should be banned from all websites, rental machines, and retail stores. Absolutely horrible. So much so that the YouTube trailer won't even allow comments.DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!"
1,Pixar's Brave Ripoff,"This movie is marketed to piggy back off of Pixar's Brave. Typically a crappy ripoff wouldn't bug me enough to write a review about it, but this movie is showing up with the suggested movies while browsing actual Pixar films. It seems that this movie is mostly selling to people who are mistakenly thinking it is Pixar's Brave. It was also pretty shady that they released this movie came out shortly before Pixar's Brave hit theaters. They are monetizing on the confused."
1,Terrible,"Obviously, most of what has been said is correct. They are trying to play on people's correlation of Disney/Pixar's Brave. This moving is not about Kiara and she is only a minor character. The writing and plot are terrible and the animation is hokey. This is a pattern for this company, since it seems that they also try and get rentals based on the popularity of Madagascar 3 with their other movie ""Life's A Jungle"". These have to be two of the worst animated films ever made."
1,Terrible,"I have never left such a negative review for anything, but I agree with all of the reviews. This is not about Kiara. Creepy animation. Even the ""hero"" is scary looking most of the time. I let my 4 year old daughter pick this and had to suffer through. Try to avoid paying money to rent this! Ugh."
1,it was HORRIBLE,"I just HAD to see who or HOW anyone could give this movie anything other than a 1, 0, or negative number. OMG, it was HORRIBLE. The animation / CG / whatever that was, was done in like 3 or 4 different styles, and with people marching the same way at same time, and OMG, I cannot even tell you how bad this was...."
4,"Great collection, but a few milestones missing.","This is a fantastic collection, as any Connie Smith album would be, but there are some classics from that era missing. My only guestion to Sony Nashville is why didn't they include the great Connie Smith classics ""You've Got Me Right Where You Want Me"", ""I Got A Lot Of Hurtin' Done Today"", Til I Kissed Ya'"",and ""I Never Knew What That Song Meant Before"" ? Wait a minute: I have a great idea... Let's have a ""Volume II""! I'm always ready for another ""Connie"" collection!"
3,"This One Is Not ""ESSENTIAL""","By the time Connie arrived at Monument in the late '70s, her Billboard days were coming to a close. This CD contains her final 2 (of 39) chart hits, I ""Want to Be Your Everything"" and ""Loving You Baby"". High marks also go to "" Coming Around"", ""Smooth Sailin'"" and especially ""Don't Make Me Dream"". That one is another example of Connie giving some solid, unsolicited female to male advice. The rest of this release does not match the quality of her ""Essential"" album. Just as some Ann Rule books are for everyone and some for her fans, this release is for Connie lovers. The recommendation here is to try ""Essentials"" first. If that makes one a Connie lover, then proceed. ""Lovers"" can add a fourth star."
2,You don't need this that bad,"The only reason you might need this is for collection purposes for the sake of owning Connie Smith's Monument singles. At the time she was trying to crossover. The music definately suffered. At one time this was the only Connie CD on the market. Now that the Essential has came on the market, this is rather obsolete. Maybe look for a used copy or something."
4,"Pinzon Hotel 300-Thread-Count Percale European Sham, Sage Stitch",These are great back pillows for the bed. They hold their shape and look great on the bed.
3,Too Complicated For Comfort,"Don't get me wrong, I love this album, and the band. The 7 minds really turn tricks with the release of their sophmore album, ""Diminished"". This ska-core band make a great cd with tracks such as ""Ether"" and ""Fallen"" which makes it even greater than their previous release ""No Time""; which was a little too poppy to somes liking. However, there are some flaws. Such as the harmony of vocals cooperating with that of the instrumentals, and the times when they try to screem makes me want to scratch my head rather than jam. Nonetheless, this is still a great cd worth owning, and it makes a great building block for their next album, ""Helps Me Remember"" which turns out to be the best release of theirs yet, and a great album for anyone who loves ska-cores' collection."
3,Mixed results with MIG welding,"I've had mixed results with this product MIG welding on an auto restoration project. When sprayed on very thinly, it worked OK in a few places, but the primer was so thin there that I'm not sure it would be doing its job of protecting the metal. In other cases, where the primer coat might have been a bit thicker, my MIG wire frequently just bounced off and would not strike an arc, even when the wire was cut to a sharp tip. Getting a consistent coat thickness is not easy because the paint is thick with copper particles.In yet other cases, I got lots of splatter when the primer was at the bottom of a hole for a plug weld, leading to some welds that did not penetrate at all. It might be possible to clean the primer out of plug weld holes with lacquer thinner on a Q-tip. Lots of work.Three stars is generous since I've stopped using this product. Perhaps you will have better luck in a different type of use. It has been positively reviewed on an auto restoration site."
3,Mediocre Overview of Tin Pan Alley Songwriting Skills,"This is a nice compilation of songs that are largely forgotten today, with a little too much emphasis on certain ""crooners"" while ignoring others altogether. Nevertheless, it definitely doesn't deserve the one-star rating assigned to it by the other reviewer here, unless he had no idea what he was buying. But if someone is looking for an excellent overview of music from the 1930's, check out the astounding 4-disc box set from Bear Family Records entitled THE GREAT DEPRESSION: BOOM, BUST, AND THE NEW DEAL. It comes with a hardback book that includes loads of interesting notes and track annotations from Michael Brooks, along with publicity stills, reproductions of songbook covers, and photos of the 78's themselves. It's pricy but very few, if anybody, can compete with the quality of Bear Family releases."
1,There are only two or three songs worth listening to here.,"For the price you may think you are getting a good buy here, trust me your not. The vast majority of these songs have been forgot and thats the way it needs to stay."
5,A fantastic and funny account of the charismatic moon,"Not your usual biography but a book made up of detailed essays. The authors writing at times can be hard to take in but even so the research that has gone into putting such a book together over rides that and makes it a very funny and enjoyable read! A group of stories from friends that spent time with Moon, including hanging with ex-Beatles in California! This truly is a fantastic account of Moon!"
4,Sweet and fun set!,"I bought this for my three-year-old about six months ago, and she still enjoys playing with it. The set is very cute, with great design and good quality. My complaints are very minor: Tink has a hard time staying in the chair, as her knees don't bend. They really should have built some storage space into the set for tiny cups and such. The tea set is for two, so she could have used a friend, but then that's how they get you to buy more sets, right? All in all, a very nice, quality product that I can recommend."
5,Excellent genre crosser,"I really love Soraya's voice no matter what she is singing. The songs on this album are upbeat and fun, even if I don't understand what she's singing quite often.Speaking only english I'm somewhat handicapped at interpreting her meaning, but quite able to spot a glorious voice when I hear it.I don't buy too many non english albums but I wouldn't hesitate to buy anything of hers...I like her stuff as much as Marisa Monte's, which is saying something... Two great singers I wish would work together...buy this!!"
5,Excellent quality,This flag is very durable and an excellent quality. I highly expect it to last for years to come. I'd highly recommend purchasing it.
3,Not quite what we were hoping for,"We had previously purchased all of the other Sesame Street characters for my son, but he recently hit a Grover kick. I bought this as one of his Xmas presents, but it ended up looking like something you would get from a Happy Meal. The materials are fine, it's just very small."
1,Book about an evil man.,The title of this book is: Arafat: Terrorist or PeacemakerThere is no myth - Arafat is a murderer! He is a full Terrorist.What more is there to say?The only thing more disgusting that Arafat are those who defend him.How can Americans defend him when he admittedly ordered the deaths of Americans?s
3,For die-hard jazz fans,"I appreciate the reviews in which it is suggested that viewers try to experience this film in a broader context--as a time capsule of an era. However, as an avid fan of Anita O'Day, I was deeply frustrated by the camera's focus on odd-looking (check out the chick eating the ice cream cone!), and apparently disinterested listeners in the audience, when the camera should have been focused on this amazing singer. Still, because O'Day--at the height of her sensuous form-- remains sadly undocumented on film, this is the best we've got."
1,A total disappointment.,"I was looking for a video of these artists performing. Instead, this is primarily a video showing scenes of Newport and apparent clips of folk that were attending this event in various parts of town. The music is in the background and there are scenes of artists performing. After paying what I paid for this video, and seeing what was presented, I was totally dissatisfied. This video is like a tourist advertisement for Newport, not a jazz concert."
1,*1/2 Star* Less than meets the eye,"Pure and utter disappointment. I don't understand why this dvd received the high rating that it did. I suspect that some of the record labels pay people to post rave reviews that upon close inspection turn out to be hype. From a purely objective viewpoint, the audio and video quality of this release isn't worth the plastic its printed on. The color is washed out, and the audio sounds like rubber bands and distortion. Sure you get some head shots of some jazz greats, but that in and of itself is not worth the purchase. My advice... save your money."
5,"The best historical Jazz DVD published ever,","Fantastic images, acceptable sound track, and the best selection of players on 1958"
3,Woodstock precursor,"I agree with almost all of these reviews. The big disappointment comes when one sees the Playlist on the bonus menu on the DVD - and realizes just how many performers were NOT included in this film. I also feel that, with all these performers, less time could have been devoted to Louis Armstrong and Mahalia Jackson, and some other clips/performers used instead - or better yet, add another 20 minutes of performances. I can't rate this for Jazz, as my father, not I, is the Jazz afficionado. I'm sure he'll love this DVD.For all, myself included, who thought the movie WOODSTOCK was innovative and groundbreaking ... well, this movie, released 9 years before the Woodstock concert, so obviously seems to have influenced Michael Wadleigh's ""script"" and filmwork (other than his use of split/multiple screens) that if Wadleigh had NOT studied JAZZ ON A SUMMER'S DAY I would be most surprised! For this reason alone, this film deserves a wide audience."
3,"Satisfactory, but not great","The underlayment is okay, except it was not rolled properly and had folds in the roll which were difficult to smooth out. It was less expensive than Home Depot's product, but after using both, I prefer Home Depot's."
4,Removable ard disk with free mp3 player,"I bought this because it uses a removable 5GB PC card (pcmcia) hard disk to store the music. I just wanted the hard disk. Bizarrely, in the U.S. Toshiba has been selling the 5GB disk alone for the same price as this device (in the UK, I believe, the hard disk alone was a bit cheaper). Well, it all works; you don't need to create mp3 files using any particular software, as another reviewer said. Copying the mp3s to the player, however, does require the use of Toshiba's software which encrypts the files so that they won't work when copied to other PCs. Depending on your CPU's speed, that can slow down the copying process substantially. That's a little bit annoying, and the fact that this ties you to Windows (no software for Mac or Linux) kills one of the stars for me. Otherwise I think it's great."
3,Good product but has few problems,"I own this player for 2 months .it seems to work well.The sound quality is good .Most of all the removable harddisk is a great feature.you can store any type of file from your notebook into this harddisk and transport it.But its a little bit heavier than an ipod,also when the player is in pause mode it switches off in less than a minute.the battery life is really good.Also toshiba properietery software is a headache ,For the MP3 its like one way traffic,once your store the Mp3 files into the player with toshiba software u cant play them again in any other player or computer.Overall its a good player with few problems.i hope this review is helpful to you."
5,Stainless steel spoon rest,This is just what I have been looking for. It's very well made and should last a long time. Very heavy.
4,Beach Jumpers History,"As the Greatest Generation marches off into history, this compilation preserves some of the valorous action that earned them such reverence. It is a little incomplete, but what is there is a great backdrop for adding more the the story."
5,Good Book,I read the book and thought it was an outstanding book. Mr. May really takes his time explaining it. I have also had Mr. May as an instructor for this topic in college and it was a very informitve class.
4,This is pretty good!,"Taken from his time on Monument Records, this collection features songs from the later part of his hit-making days. The songs are essential. The only problem: no notes or recording dates. Highly recomended despite this."
2,not as good as the tv show,The tv show is a massive success world wide being one of the top rated shows on television but i was dissapointed with the books alot.There are many titles that are based around episodes of the show but to be honest you dont get the emotion the gripping storeylines as you do with the tv show.I would say they are for avid fans only there not bad books i just think the tv show is more interesting.
5,Excellent,Wonderful collection of forgotten voacalists. I wish I had purchased it sooner! Of particular interest are Mildred Bailey and the Boswell Sisters.
3,Foggy,"While the whole album is OK, there are just three songs I particularly enjoy. Most likely I could have gotten ""Slow Ride,"" which was the target, in some '70s compilation."
4,Definitely great for Portuguese beginners!,"Before I decided to order the Oxford Take Off in Portuguese online, I checked it out at a library.It's very easy to follow step by step for a beginner.It starts with pronounciations and there are several dialogues in each section. It allows you to practice and pronounce the words many times, hearing the accent well!There's a test at the end of each section to make sure you know all the new phrases/words you learned.The only drawback is that I wished there were more vocabulary and explanations of grammar in each section, so I would recommend to combine a book (i.e., Portuguese in 10 minutes a day) with the CDS/book."
3,Depends on Why You're Reading It,"I debated how many stars to give The Crux because there are two different ways of looking at it. On the one hand, this is (as the previous reviewer noted) an interesting text when viewed as part of women's history. Gilman is becoming increasingly canonized-- she was a complex and fascinating figure, and The Crux is an important part of studying her in particular and early feminism in general.That said, I thought the book's entertainment value was slim. It is melodramatic, saccharine, and often boring. Granted, Gilman was intentionally tapping into generic conventions that were associated with women's fiction, and many of these problems result from that, but nevertheless, if you're looking for a consistently fun read, you may not find it here.This is, though, a well-done edition of the book, and the introduction should prove interesting and useful to students and casual readers alike."
3,Fair effort for a first book,"This is a fair book by first time author Philip Marlin but it's not all that it could've been. The premise is interesting and Marlin lays up the setting well. Having said that the writing is slow and sometimes plodding, specially the first 2/3 of the book. The characters are too one dimentional and go through the book acting as people from the 20th century would act instead of the 11th. Frankly, this book reminds me of the last book of eric flint's Belisarius series but without the action. In that book the characters also mosey on down as if everything was predestined. Lets hope that Marlin next book will have a little more depth. I mean who has ever heard of a byzantine court with out at least one little plot behind the emperor's back?"
4,Solid performer with excellent support,"This scanner has been a very solid performer in a very challenging environment. It is wet, humid, hot, and dirty. I had a few issues setting it up, but the folks at Informatics were very helpful. I actually bought just the scanner from a reseller here on Amazon. It turned out to be an older model without the removable battery and it would not fit in the base I purchased from Informatics. When I contacted Informatics, they located one of the older style bases and sent it to me overnight at no charge. The only reason I did not give five stars is because Informatics should have changed the model number when they changed the battery and base.A word of caution for anyone trying to use a barcode scanner for the first time. While out of the box, the scanner works pretty much like a keyboard from an applications point of view, you still need to do your homework regarding barcode fonts and read the manuals."
2,Not so good after all...,"After 2 months of use, the darn thing wore through the rope and it frayed and finally snapped in half...unreal. Only buy this if your are jumping on a padded or very smooth surface. It wasn't good for crossovers or any kind of fancy jumping either...just speed.First off, this is not a trick rope. It's designed to slice through the air with speed and little drag and that's what it does very well. My Nike speed rope is fine but this thing is much faster and feels great in my hands. I love this jump rope and finally have found the rope that can keep up with my natural speed."
1,Way too long,"I didn't notice the length on the jump,rope I ordered and it is way too long. I am 5'4"" and the rope is 10.6. The rope is not adjustable. Going to see if I can exchange for a 9'. Will edit review upon exchange. I measured the jump rope I usually use. It's 8'."
2,Painful rope - but functional,"I rarely write reviews but felt compelled to as a warning to whoever buys this rope. I wanted to get a long rope for my Crossfit workouts because I'm tall and it's difficult to get one at my gym. I bought this one and at first loved it - high quality, fast, etc. However, because of the material, the rope is EXTREMELY painful when you mess up. I created several abrasions on my forearms and butt when I messed up using this rope. I will probably not use it again because it is simply too painful. Maybe I'm just being ignorant of normal jumpropes but I have used ""lighter"" jumpropes before with no problems of this kind. If you're a certified expert you'll probably love it but if just a beginning jump roper like me, I would shy away."
4,Great!,"I ordered this for my husband and he's happy with it. I would have given it 5 stars but the rope had a kink in it. i think it was due to shipping and it seems to have come out after hangin it straight for a few days, but still."
3,Spend your money elsewhere.,"This is good if you need to jump outside and cut through grass, leaves, twigs . . . that sort of thing. Otherwise it's too stiff to do anything other than elementary jumping (no cross rope jumping, or anything that requires twisting the line). Also, I'm 6'4'' and the rope says its rated for my height, but I have to hold it at the very edge of the handle to get the length I need (can't adjust the length) . . . which diminishes comfort and control. I'm an accomplished rope jumper and there are numerous ropes available that will give you a better workout and jumping pleasure - for far less money."
3,A little weak but ok,I enjoy watching BOSS on Starz network. I thought maybe this would be similar. It was ok. The characters are a little weak. Scandinavian films tend to be naive but usually good. And that's how I would put this. The story is not so interesting. The people are forgettable. Average...
5,GREAT fun to watch!,"We are fellow 'Ural-ists'.... so, loved watching Gary's adventures all over the world. Anyone who likes traveling via motorcycles would love his travel adventures. Gary does an excellent job of narrating. We own all of the DVD's of his trips and have repeatedly watched them. We like to imagine ourselves along with Gary.... you get a real sense of the countries as he visits them. His sense of humour adds to them, too.Barb & John"
2,Was hoping that this would be decent,"I'm actually a fan of Andy Dick and his unpredictable, teetering on the edge on maniacal style of comedy so I actually was hoping that this dvd, his first time film theatrical effort would actually turn out to be decent. Sadly that was not to be found with a mostly medicore and unfunny 84 minutes that felt stitched together at the last minute with a cheap (digital video) and unfinished visual style. The flick does get 1 extra star for Jack Black's cameo."
1,disappointing,"Oh, Andy. I caught a little bit of this on Comedy Central and thought the whole thing must be hilaious, so i bought it. I have been a fan of Andy Dick ever since ""The Ben Stiller Show"" and I know not all of his stuff is gold, but even with all of the quirky cameos, nothing could save this mockumentary. I laughed twice. In 83 minutes."
1,Awful,"This guy joins the list that includes such amazing talents as Carrot Top (Blueberry HEad), Tom Green etc in creating ""humour"" that is just idiotic and cheap. I cannot believe he is actually got a career he is awful. Talentless Hack. Someone needs to buy him a comedy manual or better yet remove his vocal chords so no one has to hear his awful awful awful ""jokes"""
2,Pictures without words,"Dr. Watkin and his publishers would have done better to have deleted virtually all of the text from this tome, leaving more room for the most successful part of the book, its photographs. While the bleeding of the images helps make the format seem more up-to-date, this book remains hopelessly out-of-date, the inclusion of Frank O. Ghery's Bilbao Museum and I. M. Pei's glowing pyramid on the cover notwithstanding. The gaps in this book are egregious as are the waxing and waning from over- to under-statement. While the color images are lovely, many of the black & white images of pre-20th century works seem as if they were taken from a photocopy.Dr. Watkins' propensity to treat ""the New World"" as a lost appendage of the British Empire colors the latter chapters in particular. The influence, for example, of ""The Chicago School"" barely registers within his stylometric system. As is often the case with survey books, in the end it seems quite a lot about all too little."
1,love the cartoon hate the best of releases,"ugh! come on cartoon network please stop with the ""best of"" releases and put out season sets of codename kids next door, please."
4,Classic KND Fun,"This DVD has the good old Kids Next Door action. Anything kids talk about and face in the world of KND, is a serious matter and challenge. These 5 KND members of Sector V will always live in my heart. It's good for both kids and adults because it relates to everyone, bringing out the true kid spirit that resides inside us all."
5,"A new KND DVD is wonderful, but...","It's great that there's a new KND DVD, but why aren't they coming out with a DVD collection of Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, the best show on Cartoon Network?They came out with a KND DVD, then an Ed, Edd and Eddy, so why not Foster's next instead of a second KND?I love the show, but CN should try and get all of their hit shows on DVD before they make two of one show."
1,still stupid and retarted,"ok, KND sucks. Why do they keep on making this crap?! the only show that is actually good on CN is Grim and Evil. But i dont watch it because there is commercials every second on grim and evil. Plus crap like this on cartoon network, make the disney channel look good. So dont buy this. Its so stupid with all of the stupid storylines, scripts, drawings, action, and missions.Cartoon Network, please take of KND and stop putting commercials every second while you're at it!"
4,Great Read,This is a wonderful book. I am now reading a 3rd book from this author. His style of storytelling is like looking at a picture book.
5,Fun!,"Cassie Jones is coming out of her shell with a serious makeover. Blonded, contacted...she's hot on an interview with Marine Cpt. Sam Wilder. He doesn't recognize her from their first meeting. That's fine. Cassie plans to be keep a professional distance...but discovers distance from Sam doesn't work! Every time she's around him she wants to get closer...much closer!Humor and sizzle...Sleeping Beuaty and the Marine has it all!"
4,Scintillating Claudine transcends the piano-lounge genre,"No, she wasn't highly successful with her albums, her singles never peaked high on the charts, but Claudine Longet was a class act nevertheless, oozing French luxuriance but never decadence, she was the All-American French-girl-next-door. Her singing, highly imbued with her accent, is lilting, purring, often coy. The material she was given wasn't bad. Yet the production is first-rate, with high-quality session players supporting her. ""Think of Rain"", ""Man in a Raincoat"" and ""Creators of Rain"" turns out to be an intense trilogy, alternately sung brightly and with melancholy. The Beatles tunes aren't particularly gripping, but they do swing, and Claudine's version of ""The Look of Love"" is one of the best. She couldn't do a bad record, such is her grasp of our culture and the notion of romance. Turn down the lights, light the candles and fire up Claudine!"
2,Lifetime guarantee 10 inch pan,"Wearever 10 inch saute pan. They have so many I do not know if it is the same one, however their guarantee is bogess. The pan was warranteed for life, yet nothing ever touched it other than a Rubbermaid spatula. the nonstick woredown and became useless. This ol' Grandpa is fussy. Their comeback was it had been abused and that is not true. They agreed to replace it on a one time basis, but not to back their lifetime guarantee. this is dishonest marketing. May the buyer beware--and to reviewers who review on a short usage--use the product for a while before responding. It might just give the shopping public an honest choice."
2,What-ever!,Wears horribly. Nonstick bubbles and peels though I use only silicone tools on it and nothing abrasive. Handle stays cool and it heats evenly. But it won't last.
1,stupid,this is the stupidist book i have ever read god dammit what kind of people wrote this book. they're really crazy
4,A continuation of Forever,"Here are the rest of the Dubs of the Forever CD. Very unique dub. Don't expect your typical Dub Syndicate, Black Uhuru style dub here. This is less eccentric, but very Israel Vibration. A pretty good cd regardless. I personally enjoy the vocal versions quite a bit better. Such perfection in the voices.The music is very nice though."
2,used it for reasons other than sawhorse but not too steady,Needed something of this shape for reasons other than sawhorse. it works fine for that BUT not very sturdy as a sawhorse. The legs are bit flimsy and dislodge relatively with ease.
2,Annoying for parents,"The Playmobil products are nice and fun, BUT you must realize that every single piece of every single object comes apart. The hair pieces come off of the pilot and stewardess's head; the wheels come off, the airplane door comes off; the wings and tail comes off in many different pieces; the steering wheel comes off; and, there are many small pieces inside which you will never find after you child plays with it once. I would LOVE this product if I could get it to stay in one piece. I used the strongest glue I could find to keep the pieces in their respective places, but to no avail. The other Playmobil products are the same way. My 4 year old loves this plane, but he is also frustrating by having lost most of the little pieces. Such a disappointment."
1,DVD will stop in places.,"DVD will stop in places, I think it was used, infromation when veiwable, was fair at best!"
1,"After listening to this drivel, I became an atheist","Listening to this cd of supposed inspirational music certainly had a profound effect on my life. One listen through of this thing and I became convinced there was no God. God certainly would not listen to this type of music if he existed, and God also wouldn't have Gavin Hadley on his side. I have farted all these tunes out and made them sound better."
1,pcdj,the product so far seems great - going to be used to mostly to do weddings. No complaints so far.
4,Nice light bar,Nice light bar but..... I didn't like that it only came in gloss black. Easy fix with an easey install.
2,More bore than boo.,I was looking forward to reading this book and when I finally did it was a let down. It's not scary. It seems to be written to scare children rather than to inspire chills or midnight scrambling to turn on all the light in the house.Read his book Quit Your Job and move to Key West. Now that's a great book!
2,gave this to my 18 month old,"I got this toy for my 18 month old little girl who is a nurturing little mommy already. She just loved it. She enjoys changing the location of her little baby - carrying, rocking and pushing the little doll around. Each of the pieces is cute- but I agree that they are not the sturdyest of toys. For the money however, as I did think this was a rather inexpensive set, it is fine. Not hard to assemble and easy to replace if need be down the road!"
1,Mutabaruka Rules.,"Dub poetry is the business of original thinkers. If you're not passionate about what you're talking about, don't even worry yourself, you're no poet. (Clear themes, clarity of verbal delivery, a message that is deep and useful to the whole of the world. As a dub poet, your goal is definitely not money or girls, on the contrary, its to make the world a better place for every one. To become a dub poet you need to have thought deeply about life, and the human story. If you cannot do this and you stil want to record your stuff on CD, you bette find someone to help you compose some useful lyrics. However the verbal delivery will still be flat, because the message won't be yours!So I'd say on my list of REAL dub poets I have1. Mutabaruka (the topmost universal revolutionary poet)2. Linton Kwesi Johnson (the originator/urban UK poet)3. Oku Onuora (Yardy Communistlike poet, man of the poor)4. The late Mickey Smith5. And last but not the least a (USA/UK based) guy called MC Ras Tee"
3,XL sounds toned down,"When compared to their first CD, this one sounds weak as far as the lyrics go. Sounds like someone told them to tone it down for this one. There are still some messages here, but not as explicit as ""República de ciegos."""
5,Color Book,I bought this book the first year of design school and used it on a consistent basis. Its a great addition to any designers collection and provides a place to reference color palettes from various periods in history and culture.
2,SURE NOT,"I TOOK A WHOLE MONTH FOR THIS PRODUCT TO ARRIVE, I CONTACT THE SELLER TWICE AND SHE TOLD ME THERE WAS PROBLEM WITH THE SHIPPING AND SHE WILL SEND ME AN EMAIL WHEN THE PRODUCT WAS READY TO SHIP. IN THE WHOLE MONTH I DIDNT RECIVE NO EMAIL ABOAU THIS ALL THE EMAIL THAT I RECEIVED WAS SAYING THAT SORRY ABOUT THIS PROBLEM AND ALL THAT.THE PRODUCT IS GREAT THE SELLER AND ALL THAT NOT THE BEST"
1,DMT Failed to deliver a quality,"I bought this product because it advertised all the right features:Three surfaces at one place, with different levels of sharpening needs, with diamond dust as ideal sharpening medium.At first, I was very happy, although at the same time, I tried to sharpen my Cold Steel knife with a friend's pocket tool (that contained single diamond flick-out surface) and got better result than with DMT triangle tool.I like to sharpen my knives quite often, for some reason, it gives me great pleasure to slice tomatoes with a perfectly sharp knives, while making my salads.It turned out that DMT sharpener has very short wear & tear life. I will try to post photographs so everyone can see how sharpener looks after a fairly short use.I also plane to design a quick web page with HD photos, so everyone can see in detail that it is just not worth the money.""Diamond"" surfaces are long time gone, and the tool is only good for jamming the door open.Don't waste your money."
3,Not what I expected,"When I bought this book, I thought it would focus more on spiritual growth and getting in touch with our inner self and our feelings. Instead the book quotes the Bible back and forth as if being a spiritual person is the equivalent of reading the Bible or even quoting it. So I was rather upset about that clear endorsement of Christianity via Bible reading. However, if you skip the more religious stuff, it is a rather enjoyable book to read. If the editorial review had mentioned all the Bible/Christian endorsements, I would have not purchased this book.Before you slamm me, note that I am a Christian person, but I also believe that there are other religions out there that have merit and I don't think that being a good Christian means that you have to read the Bible and go to church. From my experience, I see tons of people who do both and are lousy human beings. Actually, I avoid going to church because I don't want to mingle with the many hypocrites that go there."
1,Big Words Much??,"The Idea behind this book, as I was lead to believe, was to instruct the reader to practice radical honesty. All it did for me, however, was reintroduce me to my dictionary. The author fills his writings with underlying put-downs and sarcasm, telling the reader that they are ""pathetic"" if they believe one thing and just plain stupid if they really believe the other. I didn't make it through chapter 3 and I loaned this book to a friend of mine who said she didn't get past the first. I waited for this book in the mail for three weeks (I'm in Germany), tore open the box when it arrived and put everything else aside to begin my ""journey"". I thought this book would be a great follow up the the Celestine series and ""Heaven Within"", but all it proved to me was that Mr. Blanton had a PhD and I didn't. How Pathetic of me."
4,"The best, for now","Until a new edition is easily available, this is the best edition for availability, price and convenience of this important work by Bruno. Note, however, that it does not include Bruno's ""Argument"" nor his dedication to Sir Philip Sidney. These, however, can be found relatively easily online."
5,Very nice quality product for the money...a great value,"Though there are not many opportunities for my dog to wear a life jacket, we did recently take a boating trip to do some crabbing in the bay on the Oregon Coast. I strapped my little guy into his life jacket and I have to say, his jacket was a better quality than my own life jacket! The velcro and the back-up ""clips"" held him into the main body of the jacket. There is also a little cushioned strap that adjusts and clips right on his chest so he is secured. I love the little carry strap on the top and the d-ring for his leash to attach. A very nice and quality product!"
1,Beware!,"""This innovative book is the product of an NSF funded calculus consortium based at Harvard University and was developed as part of the calculus reform movement"" Beware of Harvard, i.e. reform Calculus. Instead of teaching people about maxima and minima, you show them how to use a calculator to guess. What a load of junk. Nobody learns what anything means, just how to apply formulas, etc. It is a shame what books and authors like these are doing to college mathematics. This book is particularly bad, a whole bunch of fluff, not a damn ounce of substance."
1,HORRENDOUS!,"This is the worst math book I have ever been forced to buy. This book does not teach you calculus, it only gives word problem after word problem that your regular calculus student will not be able to solve! Most require a knowledge of physics or economy, as well as even-- topography! I am SO FRUSTRATED with this book. If someone has any idea where I can get the complete solution's manual, (the student solutions manual only gives answers to 25% of the problems, in such a way that I can't possibly practice enough to do well on the exams or even LEARN), please email me at angelaalbert@hotmail.com THANKS, and good luck to you all that take math with this book. You will need it."
4,CUTE,"I will preface this with the fact that I haven't found a Kasey Michaels book I didn't like.The premise of this story is that successful decorator (to be)goes to the aid of her beloved Aunt to save a tree. The evil neighbor who wants to cut down the tree isn't really evil - he's a dad with a young son. Having had relatives similar to the aunt, I laughed a lot while reading this book. In the end, love conquers all and there is a happy ending (of course).The funny part for me is that I actually have been to the area described in the story line - it takes place in a simpler time and a gentler world."
3,I like many of the cards but...,"I bought this deck for many reasons, I love Doreen Virtue, I enjoy much of her work, and this was one of the only decks that I could find that had BAST in it. I think many of the cards are beautifully done, however I found that having so many different artist's work in the deck with their different styles, some which I honestly have to say I don't like, to be confusing and disrupting when I'm trying to read the deck.The reason I'm writing this review is because I wish that I had known this before buying the deck, I have to strongly visually resonate with any deck I work with. Hopefully this knowledge will help someone else.This is the only deck (out of many) that I have, that is created by multiple artists, when I first got the deck I didn't think that would be important, but the more I read with it the the more it is becoming so."
3,Not bad but..,"I do like this deck, it's great. Art work is nice, well laid out. But I don't like how they are called Goddess Guidance when quite a few in the deck are...not goddesses but more like martyrs or spiritual leaders or saints. That's my only major hiccup with the deck but I should have expected that with someone like Doreen virtue."
5,Goddess Guidance Oracle Cards,Wonderful : Magical : Natural. Intuitive. Intelligent.Everyone needs to become comprehensivelyin tune with the intuitive nature ofThe Goddess.
5,Goddess Guidance Oracle Cards Rock!!!,A must have for every exquisite diva with magick up her sleeve! Gloriously inspiring & delicious!
3,Keeps you reading but...,"Wallace pulls you through the story, you really want to know, will she appear? What will happen to some of the characters who are sick, or wishing for miracles? What I didn't like, another reader mentioned, the regular descriptions of the women's bodies when the undressed. interesting how it was always the attractive women that managed to undress down to the skin for the reader! It felt kind of creepy, kind of peeping tomish. And I'm afraid the women characters were all portrayed pretty stereotypically, either beautiful saints, or cold business women. Overall, character development a big zero!"
3,Not True!,"While Mr. Wallace's books are great, I take exception to the notion that St. Bernadette stated that Blessed Mary will return to the Grotto, I have read all of the existing letters written by Bernadette and read everything about her, nowhere does she mention this. She was given 3 secrets by the Virgin Mary, and never did she divulge them to anyone, ever. They were meant for her only and had nothing to do with France, the War, further apparitions, etc. This notion is purely speculation and Bernadette time and time again under oath told the story of the 18 apparitions. As she so aptly said, "" To embellish the story is to distort""."
4,Our Lady of the Harbour,"A beautiful story. Well, worth reading. Please note this work is a chap book, not a full sized novel. The story was later reprinted in one of DeLint's anthologies, ""Dreams Underfoot""."
5,King of Funk,"Rick James is truly Missed. Man the Brother was Soulful and a down to earth Soul Brother. He whipped on that Purple Elf,but the Elf got all the glory,but he couldn't hang with no Rick James. Rick James never threaten any of his fan sites or sued fans,etc.... Rick Brought the funk and the fans loved it and still do. Mary Jane is still so fly. give it to me baby,dance wit me, cold blooded, and so many other jams on here that speak on the Greatness that is Rick James's music. Rick always kept it real and never went out like a turkey. strong songwriter, Producer,arranger and opera style vocals that still hit home. Rick was a powerful stylish Musical Icon and left so many timeless songs. the Brother is Missed big time."
5,RIck James Is The MAN!,"Talk About a Genius Who GIves Up Grooves Like it's Nothing too it? as a Writter,Arranger,Producer,VOcalist,Instrumentalist Rick James Can do it all.these Jams sound as fresh Today as they did when they first came out.The Trademark Bass,Synth,&Stone City Horns Explode.You Feel The Richness&Many Styles From this Great Musical Genius.GIve Up The Funk For THe Man.His Music is TImeless."
1,vulgar and crass,"I ordered this CD because I heard Super Freak on a commercial and I liked the beat. When I got CD I knew I had made a mistake by just looking at the inside artwork. There was Rick James licking a leg of one of his singers. The lyrics only substantiated the picture and I actually found a perfect place to store my new CD, in the trash with the rest of my trash!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Amazing Bible!,"A friend recommended this Bible to me; after he told me about the people that were involved in publishing this Bible, I didn't hesitate a minute to order one. This Bible, while the KJV, is, indeed a ""Comfort-able"" Bible. It gives insight into how to deal with non-believers, political and social issues from nay-sayers, etc. There is a huge ""How to use this Bible"" section in the front, as well as a great endorsement from Kirk Cameron. Ray Comfort's Preface is a great ""beginning"" to understanding how he came to compile this Bible so that believers and non-believers or new Christians can answer whatever questions they might have about our Lord and ""being a Christian"" in today's world.The Bible arrived in great condition; ""NEW"" as promised and the transaction was great, too. The Bible arrived much sooner than I had expected; price was less than I could get it in a Christian book store (if I could have found it there). Thanks! Enjoy this Bible!"
3,Suprise Feature? KJV only people be aware.,"This is an interesting resource. Has pictures and saying through it. Also has a timeline of church history in the very back. Several doctrinal helps -- witnessing to Muslims etc.It has a surprise feature in that it seems to be advertised as a KJV Bible on the box, but when you get it lo and behold it is a ""Comfortable"" KJV. It seems very similar to the NKJV but apparently must not be quite the same. Apparently the compilers have done the work of changing the ""archaic"" words themselves."
5,Evidence Bible,"This is the BEST BIBLE I'VE EVER OWNED!!!! 1st off it's a King James Version, 2nd Ray Comfort makes it easy to navigate through! If you or anyone you know have any ""Questions or Objections"" against what the bible says, the contents make it easy for you to view what the bible itself has to say about the issue. There are amazing comments by very well known evangelists, scientists, etc. given throughout the bible to help you understand how the world is thinking and what the bible is teaching!Your missing out if you don't have this bible in your library!A+++Very Highly Recommended!"
3,Interesting but Boring,I own this Bible and have given it as a gift. It's side notes are amazingly interesting but I find it hard to immerse myself into the King James Version of the Bible and that's the only version this particular Bible comes in.
4,Cool debut :),"The biggest problem with this album is that it should have started with the space pop anthem ""Farms + Arms"". What a groovy track! I also dig ""Sidewalking"" & ""Passenger Seat"". ""Spiders"" creeps me out but turns on my girl friend. I saw Amsterdam at the Red Bank Street Festival in New Jersey and they got shut down by security mid set for inciting a riot and being too noisy :) Then Brian Amsterdam himself was mobbed by pretty teen age girls and had to jump up on a PA stack... What a life..."
5,Good advice for anyone in school,"I have read ""The College Student's Instruction Book"" and think that Gillespie offers many very practical tips. I have recommended this book for all my high school friends about to enter college."
3,slipper,pretty comfortable but after awhile seems to get too wide and band does'nt fit tight enough.
5,Sooo Comfy!,"I bought these for my mom who just had toe surgery and needed open-toed slippers. She loves them! That's no surprise, because I have 4 pairs of the Acorn Spa Wrap slippers myself. Those are the closed-toe, regular slippers. But they're made with the same adjustable closure and the same memory foam soles as these Spa Slides. I don't think you'll find anything more comfortable than these slippers."
2,"Clodhoppers, To Hard","After reading all the good reviews on these slippers I went ahead and ordered a pair for my mother thinking she too would love them, unfortunately NO she didn't.We thought they would be soft and easy to walk on, but NO they're not. The inside of the sole is alright, but the bottom sole to walk on is very hard, like a shoe.If you're looking for a regular bathroom type slipper that's flat and cushy, then don't get these. It you want a heavy indoor/outdoor slipper-shoe, then these are good for you.Yep, my mother said these slippers were like walking on ""Clodhoppers!"" They're very heavy. So we're returning them."
2,Slippery slippers,These slipper a soft and fuzzy but they do not hold my foot like the ones I replaced.. the top is so soft that my foot slides off sideways.
5,Perfect,Love these nice cushion very supportive adjustable. Good if you have a heel spur nice memory foam type cushion hard to find this type of slipper in store.
4,"A+ for comfort, B- for looks","These slippers really delivered on comfort -- I'm actually excited to slip them on when I get home! Pillowy soft luxury. And support. (For a slipper.)However, the foot bed on these slippers is pretty wide, so the slippers are not a very feminine/cute choice. I feel like I'm wearing the slipper equivalent of Birkenstocks. (Not in the hippie sense, but in the clunky sense.) I got them in French blue and now wish I'd tried a lighter color to make them look less heavy.Also, I am a true 7.5, and I got the 6.5-7.5 size. I have extra room all around, and wonder if I should've gotten a size smaller... Oh online shopping."
3,Foamy Slippers,"Have only worn these two weeks, but so far the foam inside is very comfortable. I do wish, however, that the velcro area was a little larger. I am hoping that these will last a long time, for this kind of money."
1,Fell apart,I was so happy when I first put these slippers on - they were so comfortable. After one month they started to look really worn out and the material at the toe and heal started to get holes. Definitely not worth the money.
3,Hard under the foot,"After the dog ate my favorite slippers I was looking for a comfortable replacement. The description looked like this would be it. Unfortunately the portion under the ball of the foot is not nearly as soft as the part over the foot. On the positive side it is the correct length for the stated size and it adjusts easily for my narrow foot. If it had good cushioning under the foot it would be great. The sole is slightly flexible, but not as flexible as a spa slipper would be expected to be. The rubber sole is substantial enough for a quick trip outside to get the mail. It is made in China."
2,Huge,"I have narrow feet and find it impossible to find slippers that aren't too wide. Daniel Green makes narrow slippers, but they are so poorly constructed I sent both pairs back.I thought if I ordered these I could tighten up the velcro. Unfortunately, the sizing runs really big, so not only are they way too wide, they are way too long. I won't be ordering Acorn again unless they add narrow to their sizes.On the plus side, they are super soft and light weight. Hmmm.... who do I know that Santa can give these to this Christmas?"
2,Disappointing,"bought this for my teen daughter, who read briefly, then put it aside. She didn't care for the prose or format."
2,Average glasses,Bought these thinking they would be like other Marquis Waterford glasses. The Marquis stemware I've bought are really substantial and heavy glasses. Same for some rocks glasses that are really heavy. Another reason I bought these pilsners was for the smoke color.What I received are crystal clear glasses that are quite thin. They are nice glasses but just average for the money.
4,A Kung Fu Uniform that fits!,"This uniform is comfortable. It allows the martial artist plenty of freedom for movements. I especially like it because the sizing for height is different from other brands. Unfortunately, if it is washed in lukewarm water, the color does fade to grey. The dye does not hold up well to multiple washings."
3,to wide pants,"I like that it is of cotton so it is not complicate to mantain. But material is somewhat too thick, so I quite swet in it, and also trousers are too short and at same time too wide in the belt, so if You have more gracious stature they are much too wide even to repair.With kine regardsZvjezdana"
2,Hush Puppies Clog Slipper,"Easy on, easy off and comfortable too! Can wear outside or in and a great price to ""boot."" No pun intended!"
1,"I, too, hear them all day.","Similarly to the other reviewer for these slippers, I, too, hear them all day. Except I found this a good reason to give them only one star insead of five. I mean, I'd give them five stars if the crooks who broke into my house last week wore them and I awoke because of the loud noise these slippers made. Yea, that would get 'em a pretty hight rating. But as the bums who ransacked my pad did so while I slept soundly not 10 feet away, they get a low rating from me. The theives surely wore footwear of a better quality."
3,FootSmart Women's Stretchies Slip-ons,"FootSmart Women's Stretchies Slip-OnsVery comfortable shoes but not very foot-flattering. The shoe is much cuter in the picture than on your foot. These have a tendency to make your foot look extremely wide - ok, I'll say it - they make your feet look FAT!!! (and I purchased them in ""slimming"" black) They also are very hot. Great for wintertime, but I live in Florida. Good thing they are washable. If you like to have your feet warm, these are perfect for you. In my opinion, they are not worth the money."
2,look like bedroom slippers,"I bought these as a comfortable shoe; one person wrote looks good with jeans. I thought I could wear them to airport, shopping, and dress down Fridays. They look like slippers though, and expensive for just slippers. And they're huge so if you still decide to get them, order down a size. What was I thinking -that they would shrink? If I hadn't worn them, I would return them!"
5,Excellent for the right purpose,"This is the greatest shoe for a specific purpose. For those of us with disabilities or swelling there is nothing better under $150. These shoes stay on and the stretchiness allows them to be worn all day. Also they are light enough for those who have stroke or age-related weakness. The removable insoles work very well when one has edema on one side only. I wear nothing else these days after years of wearing ""orthotic"" friendly clunkers. They should be great for a ""house"" shoe. Best wishes to those of you who still have a lot of choices in footwear."
2,footsmart stretchies,"I bought these shoes because of the stretchie fabric; I chose the blue color. The very thin insole crinkled up at the toes and made the shoes uncomfortable. When I called the company, they did not have replacement insoles available and had no suggestions for making the shoes more comfortable. Also,the blue color got very dirty very quickly, and the shoes look terrible; I wouldn't wear them anywhere now but at home. I would not recommend these shoes, as now they are both uncomfortable and dirty."
5,Follow Your Dreams:The Story of Alberto Santos-Dumont,"This is a beautifully illustrated book about a young man's quest to find a way to fly. The young reader visits Brazil and Paris through the story and pictures, as well as learning about perseverence. A good book to begin introducing the early grades to biography."
4,Excellent Book,In this fascinating booklet Henry Bradley brings his typical insight to the subtle interconnections between written and spoken language--and the result is actually quite a bit more engagingly readable (and even humorous in parts) than the rather bland title suggests.
2,strange book,"dr.guillen's historical sketches are entertaining, but he makes several egregiously false statements in the book. on page 62, paragraph four, he describes a perpetual motion machine which he claims actually existed. p.116, paragraphs 3 and 4, he explains the mechanism of lift on a wing incorrectly. on p.27 he describes globes as ""two dimensional circles"". on p.183,paragraphs 3 and 4 he gives an incorrect explanation of paradoxical undressin(it's actually a result of perepheral vasodilitation,following failure of the autonomic nervous system). p.187, paragraph 3, he says the heat capacity of water is less than that of air, which is incorrect. in what subject, exactly, does he have his phd?"
1,Inadequate mathematics,"I give this book the lowest possible rating because it containsvery little in-depth mathematics, and when it does attempt toexplain what is going on, the results often are incorrect orinadequate. (For some specific errors, see the review by theperson from Pleasant Hill, CA)The real problem is that if you don't already have a good graspof the mathematics being discussed, then it is unlikely you willrealize that you are reading errors and nonsense.So, here we have a math/science book that is full of factualmath and science errors. Are we supposed to now believe thatthe author has something worthwhile to say about the ""humanaspect"" of the subject?One more thing: This guy puts PhD after his name. I supposethat is supposed to give credibility to what he writes. Well,I don't know what subject his degree is in, but it is definitelynot Math or Physics."
3,Five Equations That Changed the World:,"For a book about math this one is pretty good. The book doesn't just try to explain the math, each section is a short story about the man that came up with the equation and how he came up with it. The stories are interesting and the math is explained so just about anyone could understand the basics of it. Even if you don't like math I think you will enjoy the read. I would recommend this to anyone who has trouble understanding or would like to understand the equations better, especially kids in thier early teens."
3,"Good biographical history, but not any significant teachings","This book is a mostly if not all about the biographical history of the scientists. It is very easy to read, since there are no teaching materials what so ever. I recommend this book to people who are interested in the lifes of these 5 scientists, rather than their development. I expected to see more formulas and mathematical concepts. However, this was not the case. The author did a good job in describing the events that lead to the discoveries by these scientist. It does not go into any detail about their actual work."
4,a book for everyone,"This book offers great insight into the historical foundations of modern physics through exploring five equations and the people who deduced them.Guillen is much stronger in explaining the lives of great scientists than their equations. However, by reading about the conditions of the lives each scientist faced one gains a much better understanding of the ""evolution"" of science.As a prospective physics major, I found this book particularly inspirational and have shared it with my friends (who also enjoyed it).I recommend reading this book, if only because you'll feel smart next time your professor starts rattling off anecdotes from some scientist's life. If you're not a science person, it's a good general introduction. Not too strenuous, yet not too basic. My recommendation: Go for it."
1,"Trite, inaccurate, and a waste of time","A wonderful idea poorly executed. This book is trite, shallow, and inaccurate. Apparently to make the book easier to write, the author appears to invent facts -- there's no way to tell for sure since there are no notes, references, or bibliography.On the other hand, the book probably meets the standards of most fourth or fifth grade biographies -- biographies that emphasize action, concoct dialog, and make up dramatic encounters. These biographies also have the virtue of being interesting to the uncritical minds of children. I have trouble believing an educated adult could tolerate this book.All in all, this may be the worst book about science and mathematics I have ever read."
2,I was astonished at the errors.,"The pressure on a dam wall has nothing to do with the volume of water behind it (see chapter on Bernoulli). Carnot's principle has nothing to do with losses due to friction & finite insulation; it states that even with zero friction & infinite insulation there is still an inevitable loss when converting heat energy to mechanical energy; the specific heat of air is very low compared to water, yet this book claims just the opposite. The errors go on & on, & I'm astonished that no one seems to have spotted at least one of the ones mentioned above"
2,5 Equations That Changed the World,"While the author is clearly an excellent writer, I did not enjoy the content of this book. It was required reading for my AP English Language and Composition class. It was not relevant to the class and I was frustrated every time I had to read it. If you are EXTREMELY interested in science AND history,then maybe you should read this book. However, I would not recommend it to a peer, or anyone else."
5,Very inspiring,I think the American Native Indians are right we should revere our ancestors. A very well written account of the perseverence and tribulations of five pioneer scientists. Everybody should read it. It is enjoyable and informative.
3,Nice biographical stuff,"The math in this book is virtually non-existent but some of the scientific explanations were very simply and nicely done. It is very light reading, great for getting newbies interested in math and science and therefore the errors that have been pointed out in earlier reviews didn't bother me so much. Although it did annoy me a little that in the last chapter the speed of light was stated a couple of times as 300M miles/hr (instead of 300M meters/hr), but it was correctly stated in other places so therefore just an oversight. Next time however, more technical editors should be employed. Mostly what I enjoyed were the biographical slices, for example, I could never sort out the history of all of the Bernoullis, their family politics and their connections to Euler. I also liked the idea of Faraday being included even though he did not actually pen an equation, it was a stretch to get him in there but he was an experimental genius and always worthy of discussion."
5,More than a book on physics and math,"This is more than just a physics book. It's more than justa mathematics book. It's a humanistic, clearly written,conversational book that I recommend EVERYONE reads. Notjust people in technical or scientific fields. This isthe type of book that expands someones knowledge, that letsthem see the world in a new light. No longer will you lookat the world the same way again (especially when you findout that the world is against you in chapter 4!). Superbread. High school algebra is all you need to read thiseloquent and succint book."
2,Too hard to separate fact from fiction,"First of all the formulas on the cover aren't even accurate. They're written like you would in grade school math class--even by the time you are in high school you wouldn't present them this way.I also find it untenable that he doesn't separate speculation from fact in the biographical research. Extrapolating their thoughts is one thing, but you have no place to draw the line between the information he has researched and what he imagines happened."
2,Disappointingly superficial,"I was very disappointed with this book. Very superficial, rather patronising and with too many references to his previous book. We didn't get to learn much of the science and the writing style, particularly the beginning Newton chapter, was very poor. He writes biography as if there was no uncertainty even 300 years after very minor things happened. Save your money and buy another science book"
3,Five Most Influential Equations,"This is an interesting book. However, I feel that as a writer, he is not that good comparing to Issac Asimov or George Gamow. The flow of the book seems not continuous. I have to spend several days to finish reading it, not because it is hard to understand but it is just easily interruptable. I am not a physicist but I kind of think Danial Bernoulli's equation (1738AD) is not really that influential since it took more than 150 years for human being to get the first airplane flying. I doubt that Wright brothers really using this equation to have their plane flying. Also I don't know how the Entropy equation changes the world except that it is a very intriguing concept. (...)"
3,A dream deferred,The book was in excellent shape. I purchased it for my daughter for a reading assignment. The book arrived at the time it was due. I received a nice book for a good price.
1,Not worth the money,This is 11 pages. The first page is a picture of the book. The second page is copyright information. Then you have only 9 more pages of content for $4.95. There are spelling and grammatical errors - not worth it.
1,Waste of money,Don't waste your money on this; only 9 pages of content. It's not enough to convey the essence of the book.
4,Go Tia go Tia go!,"This is truly one of the best in the brainship series. Anne has done it again. I especially loved the way she wrote the title character, how she was a softperson before and all. This book has deepened my empathy for people with disabilites. Action, romance and mystrey all in one. But I'm quite surprised that in the end, Tia didn't accomplish what she had set out to do... Well I guess its up to us to finish the story ourselves."
5,Teddy bears in outer space?,"As Carl Weathers said in Rocky, ""sounds like a monster movie."" Nope! It's The Ship Who Searched by Anne McCaffrey and Mercedes Lackey. Lackey is able to work remarkably well with McCaffrey's setup, which includes a young girl who goes searching for the mysterious thing from her past that paralyzed her. Tia and her ""brawn"" are an interesting match...it gets weird when her brawn falls in love...with her. They finally get it all worked out, about three pages before the end...read the book and find out how"
5,THOUGHTFUL CHILDREN'S BOOK ABOUT A TOUGH TOPIC,"As a foster mother and author of books for foster children, it is wonderful to see good quality books available for foster children! The writing is easy to understand and deals with some being in foster care and then being adopted. The illustrations are charming--I like how animals are used because they are appropriate for the whimsy of children, plus they do not peg the reader into thinking about whether the book's subjects are ""black"" or ""white,"" etc. Children will be able to relate to this book, and they will find comfort in its story. -Cynthia Miller Lovell, author of The Star: A story to help young children understand foster care, and Questions & Activities for The Star: A handbook for foster parents"
5,From an adoptive parent's perspective,"We are in the process of adoptiong 2 children, ages 3 and 4, from the foster care system. We have found this book to be an excellent tool for helping our children understand their story and begin to heal from their wounds. Other books on adoption for children are based on the premise that they were adopted at birth, which has confused our kids because they have been in foster care for as long as they can remember and therefore these books are not always relevant. Zachary's new home has been exactly what they needed!"
4,A Story That Foster/Adopted Children Can Understand,"I have used this book in helping to prepare a number of school-aged children for adoption. The story line not only engages them, but they also seem to be comforted by the resolution. The story is written in such a way that they understand the message: ""It's okay to be frightened, but it will all work out."""
2,not for young children,"I got this because of the good reviews, but should have read it to myself before I sat down with the kids. This book if not for a child that is young, or isn't struggling in their placement. It refers over and over to his ""real"" parents, he runs away, and nothing really resolves at the end! Maybe it would be fine if there was a resolution, or he at least seemed happy. And it would have been nice to address foster/adoptive situations, not just group home to new parents. I don't think that's reality for most kids.Very disappointed. Luckily we have another book that we will got at the same time that is much better."
3,"Great Story, Not So Great Book","Read all the other reviews for the story context. It is a good story HOWEVER it is all black and white. This book could of been so much better with a little imagination and color. I was extremely disappointed to find the pictures gray, dull and lifeless. This book would be so much better with colorful pictures and text."
1,Would NEVER read to a foster child,I am a foster parent and a child therapist specializing in Trauma and attachment. I would never read this book to a child in foster care. This book is poorly written and does not accurately portray the way adoption works in California. The main character was adopted after 2 months in foster care. This story was upsetting to read and I threw it away. This book adds to the common misunderstandings of a child with disrupted attachment.
1,harsh and not good,"This book is sad, takes too long to get to the part where the foster animal is accepted. It imposes ideas that not all foster children might be facing and was not even entertaining. It could have been cute and useful if written well, but we tossed it :("
4,It's Great For the Policy Debate Topic of '99-'00,"This book is great for those high school policy debaters looking for an affirmative case on the education reform topic. It has great solvency cards and much more info for refuting the generic negative position. 1AC options: Change all public schools to a full JROTC Curriculum. Good luck, it's a good book for debate info."
1,Why buther this great movie?,"Who in the world would want to watch a movie that was originally 4:3 made into 16:9?! No movie lover would! Because to be able to make a 4:3 movie into 16:9 would mean you'd have to cut parts from the top and/or bottom of the image. This is even more stupid than making widescreen movies fit the 4:3 televisions by cutting the right and left part of the film, like they used to do."
3,Rockie Robbins,"This is his 1st LP. It has some nice ballads but not all his hits. He was never known for his dance tunes so some company need to put together a collection of his ballads. I purchased only because my vinyl sounds so bad after 20 years. The man has a voice and it shows on songs like ""Be Ever Wonderful"", and my favorite off the LP ""When I Think of You""."
3,Disappointed,"This CD is very disappointing. This is no where near being his best of. Songs that are noticeably missing ""I Believe In Love"", ""You And Me"" and ""Think About It"", those are the classics. I do love his rendition of the Earth, Wind and Fire classic ""Be Ever Wonderful"" and ""If I ever lose You""."
4,Not the typical Colette,"This is a great disc with the typically smooth vocals of Colette. However, this album has a much different sound than her others. Each track on the disc is a single versions of Colette origionals. It is a very chill, downtempo groove. Not that this isn't a good cd, it's just a much deeper chill-out type of sound. Colette's wonderful voice is evident in all of the disc's tracks, unlike most cd's where she only integrates her voice on certain tracks. Some of the songs, i.e. our day, contain vocals that she has used to a different back beat; but they all still sound great.This was totally different than I had expected, so be ready for it. All in all, it's still a great disc to own."
4,"A fun album, great songs!","I picked this up out of pure randomness. Truly. I always liked OM records stuff, and now there was this artist who I never heard of, so I just picked it up and bought it outright.WOW!All the songs are electronic kinda mellow lounge music. Something nice to put on at a gathering of friends or something. Very European I will say that much.Colette's vocals are strong and sure of themselves. She utilizes the full spectrum of her voice, from being very dark/jazzy (What's Wrong With Being Lonely) kind of sound, to a total full sound (What Will She Do For Love).To put it simply, a lot of this album sounds like a revamped version of Madonna's early stuff, from the ""Like A Virgin"" and ""Material Girl"" era. Put a techno driving beat to it, updated synths and you have Colette.I love this album. It's perfect for this time of year too. Something that you can blast, and people will look at you and wonder what you're looking for.If you like OM's stuff, then I reccommend this."
2,1-2 Decent Songs,"Love the Hypnotized song so bought the whole CD. Rather disappointed that no other song was an equal standout...not worth the album, buy the single instead."
1,the same song over and over again,"i just got this cd and its really a disappointment. the whole cd is very repetitive and montonous, the songs all sound alike. and her voice is no big deal, especially compared to other female artists on this label (i.e. omega brooks from afro-mystic, rene gabriel from soulstice, lisa shaw, etc.). the biggest problem for me is there is no soul, no funk, no grooves, just shiny production and droning vocals. unfortunately, i would have classify this as disco drivel"
4,Gone but not forgotten,"Although the album was released in the early 90's, it still stands as an all time favorite. Anyone who enjoys the ""fusion"" of country and southern rock will absolutely love this disc. The lyrics are humorous, and very stimulating-not the country that is played on the radio. These guys were at a high point when they put these tunes on vinyl. Favorite songs to check out are: Your Daddy Hates Me (As much as I love you); Texas Tattoo-(Hold on to Dallas, spend the night in San Antone); She's got a Rock (And I'm gettin' stoned), and Big Heart make this cd a definitive purchase for any southern county-rocker's collection...TRUST ME"
1,Wrong language,"Terrific book in English, but this version is a German translation, which is not immediately apparent in the advertising. Thomas Mann himself weighs in with a complimentary blurb -- in German."
5,my daugher loves,"they sing a lot in all 4 episodes, only the first one is about the hollidays but we watch it all year round. i have several doodlebop DVDs but this one is her favorite the songs are catchy, their costumes are a lot better than when they first came out, a lot of glitter! they also have some clips of their concerts"
2,"Spin doctors, this was real bad!!","They started so good, with the album ""Pocket full of kryptonite"" and goes on with this. thats hurt in my hart"
3,"A fun, good toy but not much educational","It's a good, cute and fun toy and I loved it. However, for it to claim an ""educational"" toy, I found one major glitch. On the tag it claims to be ""1,000,000 x actual size"", but E. coli is about 1 to 2 microns long and if it is truly a million times the actual size, the toy should be 1 to 2 meters (3 to 7 feet) long.What's worse, I bought a sperm and a white blood cell plush along with this, and they are all about the same size and carry the same tag of ""1,000,000 x actual size"", implying they are actually about the same size. In reality, sperms are about 6 microns (with a long ~50 microns tail), and white blood cells are between 7 to 15 microns, so they are 3 to 10 times bigger than E. coli.If it wants to claim an educational toy, someone should have done the homework."
5,"Educational, sure---but FUN!","I originally purchased E. Coli as an unusual gift for a stuffed-animal lover. Soft, funny-looking, and educational for the little kids. I guess they did learn something after all, because when I wiggled it at my son one day he yelled back ""He's not in me! I had turkey for lunch!""This year I bought Salmonella for my daughter who is always asking to lick the cake-mix spoon with the raw eggs in it!"
5,Very Cool,This is a fun little product. The microbe is well made and worth the $10. The tag is even funny.
4,Poignant and Riveting,"I just finished this book, and in the four days since I received it from Amazon.com, I couldn't put it down! Bugliosi's righteous anger at O.J. Simpson getting away with murder shows through from the very first page, and it simmers, unabated, from there clear through to the several fascinating appendices and Epilogue.For anyone who has even a passing interest in the O.J. Simpson case, this book is for you. It is packed full of very interesting legal tenants as well as covering the significant aspects of this case. It is obvious that Mr. Bugliosi did his research. Although, by the author's own admission, he would have liked to do more, but the publisher insisted that he get the book out sooner!Two last thoughts: (1) I wish like Hell that Bugliosi has prosecuted the O.J. Simpson case; and (2) I am GLAD that I wasn't the opposing council.Great book!"
3,"yes, yes...guilty, but could have been more effective","Though Bugliosi does a great job of showing just how guilty Simpson is, this book is simply flawed in its writing style. Many of the previous reviews are absolutely true, and Bugliosi simply has a problem with his ego. The book would have been more effective in showing Simpson's guilt and appealing to the reader if it were written in the same fashion as ""Helter Skelter."" Bugliosi needs to take lessons from Steven Ambrose or Gerald Posner when it comes to skilled writing. (PS: I know of Bugliosi's distate for Posner, by the way)"
4,Vince is right on this one,"Vince demolish's O.J. and his Attorney's. Case Closed. But one can be totally right on one case and completely wrong on another, as he has already said Oswald acted alone, and this will be the focus of his new massive work out in the Fall on the John F. Kennedy assassination."
2,Extreme Disgust,"I was disappointed in reading this book. Although Bugliosi is honest about why a guilty man was not successfully prosecuted, his anger is so extreme that he lost some credibility with me. In some places, the author set up hypothetical questions that were never asked, not as questions that could have been effectively asked, but almost as if he were asking questions and answering them. Worse than anything else, the author was so critical of others that it was almost as if he were saying that he, the author, is the only competent attorney present in the country.I have read several books by this author and have not been disappointed in them; however, this book does not meet the author's usual standard as far as pertinent, objective information is concerned. I agree that there is reason for anger at the verdict obtained; however, the anger that comes out in the book is detrimental to the message that the author attempted to convey."
4,"Honest, Straight-Forward Analysis of the OJ Trial","Bugliosi details all of the mistakes made during the prosecution of OJ Simpson. He describes outlandish mistakes by both the prosecution and the defense and how, given the volume of damning evidence, the case should have been a slam-dunk. Lawyers are too much like politicians--getting caught up in the media coverage and focusing way too much on appearances, forgetting the substance of the situation. You'll see exactly why this was the most famous and most screwed-up trial in American history. Fie on the whole lot of them, including Simpson. Great reading!"
1,Just More Propaganda for the Conviction,"This book does not fairly present the facts. Instead, it tries to say that if the prosecution had been competent he would have been found guilty. But if you read the book ""Killing Time"" you will learn that Goldman had bruises on his hands from hitting someone (he was trained in the martial arts) and 30 or so stab wounds, and that Nicole was almost decapitated, resulting in blood all over the place. The evidence against Simpson would have been overwhelming had he done it. Also, the limo driver would have seen him drive up, but didn't. So why all the mind-control? Because the Republicans were pulling another Willie Horton. During the ridiculously long trial the Republicans unexpectedly won the House and Senate. One cannot overestimate the racism in this country."
2,NOT a true crime book,"I guess I picked the wrong book to learn about Ron & Nicole's murder. This book is for those who were able to watch TV and keep up with the Simpson trial. If you were not able to do so, you'll be lost in this book. I have tried very hard to get through it, because I do like the author, but have only gotten about half way through it. Outrage is just a critique of the attorneys who tried the case -- which you might find of interest if you're an attorney yourself. But if you're looking for the true crime story, this is not the book."
3,Convicts the prosecutors if not O. J.,"Bugliosi's style puts me off, but I enjoyed at least this much about his book: he notes that the prosecutors blew a lock. No one should hazve been able to botch this prosecution. Ms. Clark, Mr. Darden, and Mr. Goldberg (among others) did. Mr. Bugliosi shows why President Bush would do better on ""The Weakest Link"" than the prosecutors did on ""The Judge Ito Show.""Bugliosi's criticisms of the jurors are as baseless in this book as they were during his tours of Geraldo's and other shows. His attacks on the ""Dream Team"" are gratuitous if for no other reason than that Johnnie and his co-conspirators played down to the level of their competition.So restrict yourself to Bugliosi on prosecution and you might learn something."
2,In Hindsight...,"I read this book when it first came out, whenever that was. Vinnie's only convincing argument was that Cochran obfuscated the truth by setting up the jury against the LAPD, on a non-existent bias based on cops framing minorities. As far as I'm concerned, and I've always believed in OJ's guilt, all the rest of the evidence COULD have been planted by police.At the time of publication, there was no evidence that LA cops had ever framed suspects. Jurors were supposed to make this leap of faith based on their own experience with racial profiling. This is where Vinnie bashes the lawyers and jurors for making, in essence, a verdict that had nothing to do with the crime itself.But as it turns out, LAPD officers WERE planting evidence and conspiring to expedite convictions by lying and backing up their partners. Maybe Furman didn't do this, but the foundation of this book, years later, is sand."
1,Had to force myself to finish it,"While Mr. Bugliosi is a highly talented attorney, his views in this book are difficult to swallow. He spends the majority of time convincing the reader how smart he is and what the outcome would have been had he been the prosecutor. Maybe, maybe not. Mr. Bugliosi who garnered respect for his prosecution of Charles Manson has now become a defense attorney and makes his living doing what he condemns Johnny Cochran for."
3,"Interesting, but...","I was fairly young when the OJ Simpson trial went on, so much of what happened in the trial was unknown to me before reading this book. The details of the evidence and the proceedings were very interesting to me and Bugliosi's analysis of the trial was sound. My complaints come from the writing style of Bugliosi in this book. I have read Helter Skelter and loved it, but this book seemed to ramble and sounded a bit as if my grandpa was complaining about something that made him angry. Bugliosi tends to repeat the same information and phrases and talk about what HE would have done differently if he was the prosecutor for this case. I would recommend the book to anyone interested in finding out more about the trial and the evidence against OJ Simpson, but just be warned that you'll be forced to endure a very repetitive telling of the information."
2,Difficult read,Bugliosi could have save hundreds of pages because his single point is made in the first few. He (Bugliosi) is a great trial lawyer and all of those involved in the Simpson case are horrible trial lawyers. He comes across as a pathetic nag. The book is nothing more than page after page of repetitious ridicule.
3,Angry,"I know that many people were outraged with the OJ verdict, but this former DA takes anger to a new level. He points out every flaw of the DA case. We all know they botched the case but Bugliosi describes the case with such disgust I had to stop reading it before reading all of it.I have read Bugliosi's book on the Manson murders and that was good but he was the DA."
3,Informative but too verbose,"I really loved Helter Skelter, Vincent Bugliosi is a super intelligent and talented former DA. I was slightly dissapointed in this book because it was a little too verbose for my taste. A lot of legal chargin. But its great if your an attorney and you want to learn how to be a good trial lawyer, learn from the master. Still an interesting read."
2,I tried to force myself to finish it.,"The self-congratulatory braggadocio of the author is most offensive. I do agree with his conclusions and his arguement, which could have been clearly articulated in a lengthy magazine article. In fact, I've read other opinions stating the same thing, and I've not been obsessed with the details of the OJ trials.While I might not agree with the jury's verdict, I would not stoop to calling them stupid or brain dead. Yes, the prosecution and the defense were less than ideal. However, I don't want to sit through page upon page of the author blathering about how wonderful and brilliant he thinks he is."
2,AN ANALYSIS OF AMERICA'S STUPIDITY,MR Bugliosi did fine with his analysis of the Simpson trial but his garbage of his philosopical agnosticism had no place in the book. He sure did not convince me to doubt the existence of God. What was his Point?
1,no one knows,"NO ONE really knows who killed Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman. But millions of people believe they know.The evidence was bungled, the trial was bungled, the media set a new level of media madness, and millions of people instantly assumed he did it. When a policeman or detective questions a man whom they already believe to be guilty, they ask questions that show their bias and they press on the man pushing for lies---again because they already ""know"" he is guilty.That alone ruins the validity of the accusations and the investigation. So, not only was there a murder tragedy, but the investigation and trial were disasters--thus a second tragedy."
5,"Powerful, Moving CD, should be released in the US.",Melanie keeps getting better with each CD. It's a shame that the US market doesn't realize this.
4,"""Heavy!!!"" Weight Champion","Before Booker Ervin took his talents to Blue Note in the late 60s, he recorded ""Heavy!!!"" for the Prestige label. Just like on his classic series of ""Books"" in 1963-64, he is joined on this September 1966 session by the amazing trio of Jaki Byard on piano, Richard Davis on bass and Alan Dawson on drums. Along with Ervin, this quartet rivaled any and all jazz groups of the 1960s. On the standard ""You Don't Know What Love Is"" just the quartet performs, but on the remainder of the album the band also includes Jimmy Owens on trumpet (and flugelhorn on the first track) and Garnett Brown on trombone. While this title is notch below ""The Freedom Book"" or ""The Space Book,"" the disc certainly lives up to its ""Heavy"" billing."
2,Difficult to put on,"This costume is really cute but my baby is going to be 1 year old and he is a regular size baby and the costume seems to be a little small. I also have to say that there are no snaps for the legs and above all that there is only a little opening at the neck to get the child in putting the feet in first. I'll have to cut the seem in the back and add a zipper, some extra work and cost I wasn't expecting. Besides, I read the other mom's review and I didn't pay attention to her, sorry I did that. PAY ATTENTION TO THE REVIEWS, we do it for us the customers."
4,very cute and easy to put on,"I bought this for my son last year for his first halloween and I loved how adorable it looked on him and it was very easy to put on him. It didn't fall apart in the washing machine like some do. The only bad thing about it was some of the little gold fibers would come off onto my clothes. But overall, well worth the cost!"
4,good DJ with a touch of the dub,"Great album, killer rhythms by roots radics and mixing by the great scientist, jammy, and philip smart. Tappa Zukie's laid back toasting glides over the dubby beats as horn lines and organ pulses float by. Many solid tracks here, and a few decent ones, nothing you want to skip over. This is some of the best DJing I've ever heard"
2,Too technical for me.,"This book reads like a PhD thesis re-written for mass consumption. All the statistics are coma-inducing and I felt like I had to hunt for useful information. I don't recommend it for the Kindle because some of the most useful information was presented in tiny charts which render poorly on my Gen II.I give it two stars because it presents a truly innovative approach to the science of decision making and, though almost impossible to finish, it taught me something new."
1,$26 for the Kindle Version?!?!,"I agree with most of the other reviews that the book is well written but will likely be enjoyed only by those who are interested in a more academic approach to the subject. I am giving this book one star primarily because of the authors' decision to price the Kindle version of this book at $26.00. I ordered the book at Barnes and Noble (and read about half of it the day it came in) but held off buying it because I saw on my cell phone that a Kindle version was available. What I missed was the $26.00 purchase price. Shame on you. The whole idea of Kindle is that the author's costs are practically eliminated, and that this savings is shared with the purchaser. $26.00 is just plain greedy. This is one customer you will not be profiting from. I will finish reading the book at the library or book store."
3,Buyer beware,"Buy it because it's really huge and hopefully hard to break.Don't buy it for the Anti-Theft Protection Offer, the fine print is ridiculous. Check it out for yourself at http://www.onguardlock.com/warranty.pdf. Also, who makes you register by mail these days ??? Come on !!!!"
1,OMG,i'm sorry but this thing has nothing to do with bike lock. maybe for motorbike. as the name says this lock is huge and really heavy. there should be a special instructions how to cary this thing around.
5,Great value for the price,"I bought this a few months ago. The paint is doing great. Looks pretty cool running air through it too. I did get a fish stuck in it once, but that was easily resolved."
5,Yummy even if your not gluten free !,"My husband is gluten free and this is my favorite granola including no gluten free cereals.Not super sweet, healthy & crunchy!"
2,Condescending yet opaque,"I didn't learn much from this book, and I don't think it was just me. I'm afraid it is one of those books written by knowledgeable people for a general audience, without much understanding of who are in that audience or what they might want to know.Example: ""Rumble is very low-frequency noise caused by acoustic feedback, tone arm resonance, motor vibration, and other problems in a turntable."" How many readers need to know what ""rumble"" means but already know about ""acoustic feedback"" and ""tone arm resonance""? And what are they meant to do with the information? The discussion ends there.Sorry to have to contradict the generally good reviews. I notice, though, that they are mainly from other wizards who think somebody might benefit from the book -- not from people who actually have."
4,Great Book,"Dragondrums was an excellent book, about Piemur's adventures when his voice changes. I prefer the other books, but this comes a very close second! I recommend this to any McCaffrey fan! the only objection I have to this book is its tendency to confuse me, thou it got WAY better at the end. A GREAT book"
3,Another popular dragon book,"Riding dragons and Thread are again a part of the growing up of Piemur.His antics get him in trouble with the other apprentices after his voice change makes a signal drummer of him.It is a young person's fantasy that is good popular reading.The very middle ages culture of Pern has a double star and new animals ( dragons) that can do short hyperspace jumps ""between"".With telepathy between dragons and their masters it has the full complimentof magic-science to make people happy reading it.For me it is just a little bit too much and too easyfor real sci fi?"
4,Dragondrums,"Piemur has always known that he is at Harper Hall because of his perfectly perfect voice and that some day his voice will change. But on the day his voice does begin to change he wonders for the first time where he belongs. No longer having the perfectly perfect voice that he used to Piemur is sent to the drummer heights to learn to be a drum messanger. But only when he goes with a journeyman harper to a far off hold and is strangely misplaced to a place even farther away does Piemur begin to understand who he truely is.This was a marvelous book, although I still really like Menolly, Piemur is a funny character who always has something up his sleeve!"
2,A Let-Down,"This book focuses more on Menolly's friend Piemur instead of her and the antics of her clutch of fire-lizards. The beginning was intriguing, but a good part of the book was confusing without a backround history of Pern, and the end seemed rushed. I don't recommend this book as your first read by this author."
2,I waited through the book for something to happen...,"This is the only series by Anne McCaffrey that I've yet read. Some amount of words were spent on pointing out events in other of her books, but which made little sense to me as a newcomer.The first two of the series were good in plot and characters, if a little under-written. (It's nearly impossible to keep track of 9 fire lizards, and it's the sort of detail that my mind strays to.) This third book is the least of the series, however, as Menolly is only a supporting character, which I failed to realize until the end.While I do recommend the first two books in this series, I only suggest reading Dragondrums for some amount of closure on Menolly's life in Harper Hall."
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY!,"This download contains 7 (!) pages:1. Headlines and common risk explanations (worth nothing)2. Letter of credit (terms) + money transfer situations (worth nothing)3. Economic indicators + Currency development (look that up in the internet)4. Currency development statistics (again), which can be found everywhere in the net or newspapers....5. Mentioning of four Export Credit Agencies + Short Risk Factor Summary (half page only!)6. Glossary + Definitions (worth nothing)7. Copyright (worth nothing)HELLO - what is this???I personally think that this is the biggest joke ever!"
1,Samsung missed the point,"The purpose of a cell phone is to communicate. This phone does have many features and does have style, but it can't communicate. The talk-out is perfect, no complaints from callers. The problem with this phone is the earpiece. The volume is loud and can rattle the phone, but the earpiece hole doesn't let the sound out of the phone. Very hard to hear and understand the caller. The phone may be OK with bluetooth. Took mine back after two weeks and exchanged for a LG 8600. Big difference in voice reception."
4,Great fun!,"I concur with reviewer ""Miller"". I love these Iversen books, and I only wish there were more. Cap Iversen (whoever you are), please get back to work and give us more Dakota books!"
2,Misnamed,"Gardner attempts to discredit the Urantia book immediately with his title ""Cult"". Believe the revelations or not, Urantia is a book that wrote the book on cults and their danger. The Urantia book even warns readers not to ""cultify"" the book. Gardner apparently hasn't read it.Scepticism is healthy and welcomed by this reader, and I look forward to more skeptics debunking Urantia. However, honesty about the content is necessary in order to trust the skeptic."
1,An Angry Man with an Angry Agenda,"Martin Gardner ia an angry man with an angry agenda.Interestingly,The Urantia Book is a beautiful book based on unlifting hope for all of God's children."
2,"Dr Sadler debunked Gardner, that's why he got mad","Dr Sadler was a seance de-bunker in the 20's and not spiritual, but a Who's Who psychiatrist. You can confirm this. Gardner couldn't direct Sadler as he desired. This is a simple human battle of wills. Following the truth leads to unexpected places. The truth about Jesus is even more unexpected, both Less and More than you may have started with. The UBook is a worthy read."
1,Why Did Martin Gardner Write this Book?,"Ask yourself the question: Why did Martin Gardner write this book?-and also-Ask yourself the other question: Why was The URantia Book put in print?Once you correlate those two answers for yourself, you will understand which is closer to the truth.On a personal level, I still marvel that Gardner could *debunk* the entire URantia Book even though he has not read it in its entirety.He must be truly blessed because with the turn of a few phrases, he can singlehandedly discredit something that took 20 years and hundreds of personalities to put into print.It has taken me over 25 years, not just to read, but to begin to UNDERSTAND the contents of The URantia Book.Maybe, just maybe, he MISSED something in his hurry to publicize the personal lives of persons involved with the human level of publication.Maybe, he missed 2097 pages of fascinating reading."
1,Nancy Drew: Secret of the Scarlet Hand,Not detailed enough. Instructions don't always follow the next move.
1,1 million pieces,Very labor intensive to set up. Every little thing you can imagine has to be put together. Once finally set up (several hours later) we were soooo disappointed on how cheap the games felt for how expensive the product was. This game has not been touched in our house since Christmas day and I would have gladly sent it back had I been able to figure out how to dismantle it!!!! $500 worth of garbage. I would give this 0 stars but you don't offer that!
5,Vintage movie lover,"If you like original story lines and vintage movies, you'll like this one. It's different, a little strange, a little neat, a little enchanting."
3,Angel,The film is predictable but well acted and the cinematography is superb. But it is the music that is really good. The musical score is worth watching the movie. I strongly recommend the score for those who like movie music.
2,Would Not Watch It Twice,The first half of the movie I was looking for Red Skelton the last half I expected Vincent Price to show up. Angel herself makes Scarlet O'Hara look like Mother Teresa. Just did not enjoy it at all because I couldn't take it seriously. Rent Persuasion instead- that movie doesn't have identity issues.
1,Campy?,I have waited a long time for this to come out on Dvd and now that I have it can't wait to give it away. Is this suppose to be mellow dramatic camp. It's a horrid little pill. One star for great cast. I'm sorry Fassbender even though you were good (the reason I wanted this was for you) a great cast does not a movie make. Giving my copy away to local library!
5,My floors are saved!,Love this rug. It stays down and the corners to not roll up. We are a farm family and these mats do a wonderful job.
2,Lots of energy but the songs go no where,"After their excellent debut album, the Knack releasd ""But the Little Girls Understand"". The band plays with energy but the songs are just not that good. Aside from Baby Talks Dirty which is catchy but sounds a lot like My Sharona, the other songs are mostly uninspiring. The reissued version from 2002 includes two live tracks with Ray Manzarek from the Doors. Ray does his thing with the Knack playing backing up and the songs plod along and bring nothing refreshing to this album. All in all, a disappointing release from a very talented and fun band. BnB Beatles Depot"
1,It's Amazing...,"...that this junk is still in print a quarter of a century after it tanked on the charts. The follow-up to the band's mega selling debut album featured a slew of uninteresting filler surrounding its first single ""Baby Talks Dirty"" which was itself simply a blatant retread of the ban'd big hit ""My Sharona."" Twenty-five years later this stuff doesn't even warrant interest as a trivia question."
4,Good album by a forgotten band,"I wasn't around in 1980, so I have no idea why one of the biggest bands in the world essentially disappeared a year later. And I can't figure it out from this album either. It doesn't sound like trite garbage. It has some very enjoyable songs on it (my personal favorite is ""The Feeling I Get."") It doesn't have any songs I would call great, which is why it doesn't get five stars, but it consists of all good songs. I can take or leave the bonus tracks. Daughter of the Law is pretty good. Yes, Get The Knack is better than this, but they are both worth your time and money."
4,Used to being Late!,"This book was one of my favorite books as a child. I still have my ragged and worn copy - my mom fixed the binding at least a dozen times. It's the story of two kittens, Edward and Elizabeth, who are always late for school, one morning when they hurry to school, no one is there! They decide to go home because there must not be school today, but is that really true? The illustrations are full of awesome details, like a Charmin toilet paper tube in a mouse's cage, prices on toys in a shop window, names on drawings by students at school, and a policecat ticketing a car in front of a ""No Parking Sign"". I remember when my mom and I would sit on the couch looking for details we hadn't yet seen. The book also has a subtle way of reinforcing learning to tell time. A great book to read with a small child you know!"
5,Great strings,"I recently bought a 2009 Gibson SG bass (a model that has a pretty short scale neck), and I was looking for a good set of strings to go on the bass. I tried these and love them. Very unique sound and easy to play on. The tone is deep and subtle, not too overpowering in a mix-- a very good thing when playing in a band. The reviewer who complained that these strings did not work well on his short neck bass is probably a novice. Yeah, you will need to clip the ends of the strings, just like you would with any set of strings. With these strings, I think I've found the perfect match for my SG bass."
1,Do Not Get These Strings!,"I have a 3/4 size Epiphone viola bass and these strings were not long enough. The colored string usually found at the end of a string begins in the middle of the 1st fret. I've been using these strings for three weeks and they do not stay in tune. The notes fluctuate very frequently. This is the first time I've ever bought short scale strings, and I am never getting near this strings again."
2,Didn't fit my guitar!,"I bought these strings for a 30"" short scale bass, and had 3 problems.1) The E string was too long for my bass, and had to be shortened at the bridge end.2)The strings were too large for the nut on the guitar, and I had to have a new one made.3)The E string is too floppy for this scale. Really floppy. This same gauge might be ok on a 34"" scale, but not for a 30"" scale.The A,D, and G strings worked ok lengthwise. They weren't too floppy either.If you have a short scale bass, pass on these."
3,A great resource; horrible prose,"Here's the bad part: You won't want to sit down and read this book for pleasure. The prose is awful, stilted, and breaks into inappropriate italics in unexpected places, making for odd emphases. Also, the villages all sound the same from the descriptions.And here's the good part: This book refers to villages that you will find nowhere else (at least not in English), including the excellent Michelin Green Guide for the region. Many of these villages are wonderful gems, tucked away where most will never find them, and there are references to further villages within many of the main descriptions. A number of these are ruined and require some hiking to get to. Finding one adds that certain something to your vacation that will distinguish it from more mundane vacations. Directions are pretty good, although not terrific, so pay attention as you drive. Bon voyage et bonne chance!"
3,A good MM manual for non-SAP MM people.,"If you are an MM type and have little or no experience with SAP, then this book is great - it will introduce you to all the aspects of the SAP Materials Management module. Be warned it is not too technical and does not really show you 'how to do things' rather it will show you 'what can be done'.ABAPers and CONFIGURERS will glean very little from this book."
1,Poor material!,The book is simply insufficient to provide an understanding of how SAP administrates particular functions. Many operations are described on a very superficial level. Buyers beware!
1,A waste of good money,"I think this author must have been given the title without knowing anything about SAP. It is a total disaster, nothing flows, no information, nothing. Save your money and take a SAP MM consultant out for dinner. You will get more information and you get food too."
1,Absolutely null !!!,"I would like to put 0 star in your ranking, but this choice doesn't exist.I am so disappointed that I could pay about (...) for a such inefficient book!No informative, only banalities and obvious sentences.I can't believe how some people could make a many in a such unfair manner.Don't buy it! Never!"
2,"Impressive title, unimpressive content","Very disappointing. There is literally nothing in this book that is not covered in much greater detail in the online help or print files. I highly recommend NOT purchasing this book unless you do not have access to SAP help files, and you wish to know what kind of functionality SAP can offer."
3,Disappointed in level of detail.,"When I read the standard review provided for this book I had the expectation that it would contain more information regarding configuration. However, most of the information was just a general overview of materials management and how it related to SAP. Most of the information could easily be found in the contents of SAP online help. I do not recommend this book to functional SAP consultants who are looking for supplemental information regarding configuring the MM module."
1,"I had this book, but I sold it on eBay","I bought this book last year and I could not believe what a mess the book was. There was no structure, no information, total mess. I tried to figure out what kind of method the author(s) used for coming up with a table of contents, but failed. If you see this on eBay, don't waste your money. There are a lot of copies floating around from India as that seems to be the only place where this is printed now."
2,Hapkido Vol.1 Disappoints,"This video produced by the Korea Hapkido Federation brought back memories of my own training in dojangs looking identical to this one while I was in Seoul.Unfortunately other than nostalgia this video has little to offer other than acrobatic demonstrations of what should be very practical techniques.The agility and the abilities of the practitioners are not in question, however this video does not really seem to know what it wants to be. It is not in any way instructional. It does not show realistic execution or reaction to the techniques shown. This demostration, like many I saw while living in Korea, seems to confuse acting and acrobatics with martial arts.This is really a shame as these practitioners are, I'm sure, really talented and could illustrate real hapkido if allowed to do so.A real missed opportunity on the part of the KHF.I would recommend Ultimate Hapkido in its stead."
4,Very Good Story line but doesnt represent ninjutsu properly.,"Yes this was a great flick but it disrespects the art fo Ninjutsu. It makes the ninja look like a warrior of evil, and incorperates lots of magic in art. All in all i give it four stars."
2,Oh my God,"This is perhaps one of the worst movies ever made (besides Penitentiary 2) but well worth watching. The soundtrack is nothing short of horrible, the dialogue is childish at best, and the plot line is so ridiculous and outlandish from the very beginning of the movie, that the viewer can only kick back, ... and laugh his/her ass off. Dont pay more than 2 dollars for this movie or you might want to destroy your home."
5,Yet another 80's classic,Excellent movie if you're into martial arts films. Also stars Sho Kosugi in one of his better films. I just wish Lucinda Dickey would make a come-back. :P
2,Entirely laughable.,"Most of Golan-Globus's films I enjoy and love (Missing in Action, Death Wish 3, American Ninja), but Ninja III: The Domination was a disappointment. I have not seen the first two entries into the Ninja series (Enter the Ninja and Revenge of the Ninja), but I will shortly because they have to be better than this third entry, I only hope. The film tries to mix kung fu with possession, and fails. I did enjoy some sequences, especially the begining, but I would not recommend this film."
2,uninspiring,"Been depressed, thought I might find some insight in this video but instead it was a disjointed confusing montage of uninspiring mumbo jumbo. Yes, happiness involves having meaning in your life and being able to pursue it. That's not deep, there has to be a lot more to say to make a 1 1/2 hour movie. What we have here is basically 90 minutes of filler, pseudo artistic imagery that's perhaps supposed to leave us feeling like we were enlightened when we really weren't. There was basically nothing useful in here for me or for somebody who doesn't feel happy and wants to gain an insight. I recommend ""This Emotional Life"" instead, that was is much better."
2,Euphoria- not for everyone.,"I could only watch about 75% of this movie before I had to turn it off. While it does discuss some very basic scientific principles and theories regarding happiness it is a very slow movie. It is obvious that the narrator had a lot of passion about this film, but unless the thought of happiness makes you happy, it may be better to spend your time doing something that makes you happy rather than watch this film. It was too long and slow for me."
1,Creepy...,This documentary creeped me out...the scenes where the narrator ranted and raved in a room alone w/ stark contrast...ugh...I couldn't watch it...
4,worth buying for many reasons,"Its true that this album is heavy on the pronounced beat and synthetic '80's sound of the instruments, but if you love Timothy's voice, you can quickly get beyond that and enjoy this album nevertheless. Hold Me In Your Heart is stunning in its hauntingly beautiful and courageous presentation, and A Better Day Is Coming is very upbeat and inspiring and includes Timothy creating an a capella ending using his voice alone. Down On Jazz Street is enjoyable for its catchy beat. There is a variety of musical styles here, although much of the album is soft rock and ballads. I still play this cd a few times each month since buying it almost a year ago, and find the underlying theme in many of the songs of persevering despite hardship to be inspiring. And of course, Boys Night Out was Timothy's highest charting single of his solo songs, and is still the hot song that many listeners from the '80's remember!"
5,better than loveless,"This album is awesome. It takes the shoegaze guitars and adds pop hooks along with just guitar feedback much like mbv. I enjoy it much better than any other album from this genere or shoegaze era. Listen to ""Lazy day"" and tell me that isn't brilliant."
2,not this one,"It bothers me just a wee bit that amazon will charge its highest prices for ebooks that are not the best versions on its own site. Please consider the illustrated Stalky for 0.99, not this. The text has only a passing acquaintance with punctuation and no idea at all of Latin phrasing. This makes understanding the authentic schoolboy slang of the time impossible."
5,so you want to go to Amsterdam...,"I tried finding this book before I left the U.S. for Amsterdam, but it was impossible. I bought the 2005 version the first day I got there.The book is small enough to fit in a pocket or purse. There's a good fold out map of Amsterdam, then a second close up map which includes the Red Light District, Dam Square and Centraal Station. There's pictures and information on different types of ""goods"" available that you'll probably want to check out. You'll find directions and info to parks, hotels and hostels, pubs, places to eat, trams and of course, Coffee Shops. The Coffee Shop Index really gives you an idea of how many coffee shops there are (aaaall around you :D). You might even save a few euro by using a coupon or two included in the guide book.You'll want to buy a second guide book to Amsterdam if you want to know about anything else unrelated. Like you would..."
2,Optical mouse,"This mouse can work just as well as the more expensive brand, but it is somewhat of a hassel to get it to do so. The software that is specifically for this mouse doesn't integrate with the windows environment too well, but with a little tweaking it can be used with the drivers and software for that ""other"" brand. However, this is not very practical and isn't really worth the trouble to save a few bucks."
2,It works...,"I purchased this mouse as my first optical mouse, and kept it for a few months. At the time I bought it it was inexpensive compared with other optical mice, and it had lots of functionality with its five buttons. However, its shape is very awkward and my hand and wrist would hurt after using it. I also found the drivers unusable and ended up using one of the MS ones, which worked great. I ended up buying a Logitech Mouseman Dual optical, which is definitely a better mouse and much better suited for me (read: game playing and graphics).Bottom line: today there are much better mice out there at this same price point from both Logitech, Microsoft, and other companies as well."
2,"Nice looking, but needs work.","I bought this mouse over a year ago. I planned on using it on my mac G3 running OS 8.6, but ended up bringing it in to work to use on my pc running NT 4.0. The mouse worked fine for the most part. Recently though, I have noticed wrist pain and that the mouse button won't always work. Keep in mind with the wrist pain that I use my mouse a TON at work. Also, I have noticed the scroll dosen't work in all programs. Same with the buttons.The reason I didn't keep the mouse on my mac; the software to program the buttons dosen't support mac os."
3,Cute,This book is a great read. I wih there were more selections in this genre. As a suggestion you should check out An Infrequent Pairing by SaFiya Dalilah.
3,Careful What You Wish For,"Think hard, do you really want to here your favorite DJ's of old struggling to overcome lame electronic beats? Well, this RAS Records compilation has plenty of it. Don't get me wrong I applaud the idea of giving the greatest toasters in Jamaican music a modern vehicle to display their talents, I just think a little more care should be given to the tracks. Give this same group of DJ's a solid, creative band behind them you'd have a classic, but without-it's not! The disc has cuts by Brigadier Jerry, Dillinger, U Brown, Massive Dread, Trinity, Big Youth, Rankin Joe, Jah Stitch, Jah Micky, Prince Jazzbo, with strong showings by Tappa Zukie(also the album's producer), I Roy, Dennis Alcapone, Scotty and one great track by U Roy & J.C. Lodge/""Satisfy My Soul""."
5,Beautiful music that stays with you forever!,"Like a few other of the reviewers here, I first saw Watson & Edge in Boulder, CO. I was so moved then that--even as a poor college student--I bought their cassette tapes for myself and as gifts and was lucky enough to go to a laser show concert of theirs! It is close to two decades now since I lived in Boulder and my tape of theirs has long been missing. Yet, I often yearn for their music and have been drawn to other music that shares some of their quality. Finally, I decided to look for them on the web and am so happy to find the recording of theirs that I first fell in love with--Tears of Joy--available on CD and MP3 download. I still can feel their music and emotion flowing through my body as I watched them up close and live on Pearl St. Mall. I recall the section of the open-air mall with large stones and a 2-year-old girl dancing to their music. The beauty of their music is timeless. It fills my heart."
3,Iris soap does exist,"I purchased this bar of Iris soap because my favorite flower is the Iris. The soap itself has the ""homemade"" soap qaulities and looks I expected but the scent leans more towards a lavernder type smell. I realize the smell of the Iris is an unique type of smell, not very prominent like lavender but this bar of soap would easily be considered lavender to me. Thanks for attempting something I suspected would be impossible to duplicate. I guess thats why I love the little elusive Iris so much."
2,PLASTIC!!!!,"I bought this tub and shower faucet because it was the only two handle faucet that Lowe's had (other than the cheap type with the round clear handles). I would like to add that every other faucet in my house is a Moen and, generally, am relatively happy with their products. I opened it and discovered that most of the internal parts were brass but most of the outer parts were chrome plated PLASTIC. What a piece of garbage! It felt like I would be able to bust the diverter spout right off the wall. The finish would surely get all scratched up after the first cleaning! I would expect more from Moen. I guess, what do you expect for the price ($82.00 at Lowe's). I gave it two stars only because it was made in the USA, which is great, and because of the low price. I would recommend this product to those who plan on moving soon, or if you don't ever plan on cleaning it! I plan to return mine to the store if I can find another two handle faucet of better quality."
1,TN,I just got this from ebay for $20. Totally disappointed. I don't even think it's worth that much. I was shocked that this plastic fixture use to cost over $100. I would not recommend this to any one unless it costs less than $10 and they are willing to go through the hassle of frequently having to fix broken or tarnished parts. Very cheap material.I know little about Moen. Someone told me that Moen is good but items like this helps little for 1st impressions.
5,Great fun & superior musicianship,"Shango, pioneers of combining rock with Jamaican reggae, came on the scene in 1969 with the single ""Day After Day (It's Slipping Away),"" describing the consequences of the erosion of the the U.S. West Coast (""better get ready to tie up the boat in Idaho""...) This novelty song never became a great hit, but the album SHANGO (A&M SP 4195) demonstrated these guys were more than a novelty act. There's a superb arrangement of ""A Taste of Honey,"" while ""Hey Jude"" is a rolling marimba instrumental. Other great cuts include a cover of Donovan's ""Sunshine Superman"" and Curtis Mayfield's ""Um, um, um ..."" The perfect party record; or just a way to lift your spirits. A second album, TRAMPIN', was released on ABC Records a year later."
3,great movie,"it's really great film. such a long time after i have seen original work. from beginning to end, you can not imagine that what will be happen in next seen. film is completely roller coaster. Particular dialog is really give perfect mood to the film. i don't say the story because it is better if you watch from start to finish. everybody have done a great job. Direction, editing, casting, Music, background music. even their was not much scope for songs some how Music director have done a great job. Particularly last 10 minis is really exiting. i like to say to KARAN JOHAR that make this kind film rather than making same kind of film, with the same casting. i must salute to entire team of the EK CHALIS KI LAST LOCAL. hey guys carry on to make brilliant movie...!"
2,Pancho Quinto& Ernesto 'El Gato' Gatell are the real stars!,"The real stars on this are ""Pancho Quinto"" and Ernesto ""El Gato"" Gatell, I can do without Jane and Larrys ""noodeling"" horns.Want great CD's? Go for Pancho Quintos first CD as a leader "" En El Solar La Cueva Del Humo "" then there's him with grupo 'Yoruba Andabo' also on the CD ""El Callejón De Los Rumberos"" AND on the tour de force ""Rapsodia Rumbera"".The ""noodeling"" horns on this make me wince.Mark / silverspurr"
2,Handle is super rough - needs to be sanded,"The first thing I noticed is that the wooden handle is extremely rough to the point that you might get a sliver if you were to use it ""as is"". Thinking that I might be able to sand is down a bit with some sandpaper rather than go through the hassle of shipping it back. Would not purchase this again. Would not recommend it to anyone."
2,Tried to hard to be like the American Version,"I lost interest on this program, as it tried to hard to be like the American version. It also seems like they went to far out measures to try and be funny. I was not able to finish episode one."
1,OK I guess,This was a gift - I don't care for movies or old TV show reruns. I should have bought a hammer or a screwdriver for my friend instead..
3,Stamina Level 3 Aero Pilates DVD,"To be honest I haven't gotten to this video yet, still on #2. I like how the #2 one mixes up the exercises, however be ready to hit the pause button a lot so that you can get back into position to do the exercise after resetting your machine. The sound on the DVD is really low, even at max levels on computer as well as the DVD it is still pretty low. You are watching the the feet of this woman alot, and really....pedicure, bunions are amazing...LOL! Other then that you will definitely get a work out - would rather be doing a lot more reps of same exercise then switching from different exercise to exercise so much."
5,Lee Slacks,"I was unable to find these slacks locally, so I went on the internet and typed in the style number and brand from an old pair like this. What a delight to find that I could buy them again, and they are great - just a little bit of spandex and they fit beautifully. I will definitely order more."
4,Lee Women's Plain Front Stretch Khakis,I would recommend these khakis to anyone! They are very slimming and forgiving
3,Lee jeans,"good color and good fit; most of the Lee jean products fit my body type well, which is why I always buy them online at Amazon."
1,needs a better description,"If you have cruised the department stores, you know that Lee makes a selection of black stretch plain front pants that fit this description, but there are substantial differences in fit and feel of the fabric. These are dowdy and stiff compared to a much softer and more form fitting style that I had purchased at Kohl's. The good news is that this vendor had what I wanted, so we could do an exchange.Before you buy, I suggest you write down the actual Lee description code and ascertain that the vendor has what you want."
3,Runs very small,"""The style was OK but I'm tall and the tall length was not long enough. The pants felt small in general, even though it was my regular style. I returned them"
1,Great chill'n music,This CD was just what I was looking for. No surpising offbeat songs. All quiet and soothing. Great for last thing you hear before sleep. Smooth transaction. Glad I bought it.
4,A great intro for the novice rugby fan,"I started following college rugby about 10 years ago and later graduated to following international matches also. I've always enjoyed watching the sport but the lack of much TV coverage in the US has made it difficult to pick up some of the finer points of the game and its rules. Rugby for Dummies has helped to fill that gap for me, with plenty of illustrations and descriptions of the individual positions, how they fit into the overall strategy, the principal rules that govern the flow of the game and, perhaps most important, the referees hand signals that explain what is being called and why. For anyone who wants a good reference guide to the sport, this is a the book to have at hand. It not only helps build familiarity for the newcomer, but also serves as a continuing reference for the committed fan who wants to keep on learning."
5,great resource,"I have re-read this book four times now, and I have to say that I've gotten something more out of it each time. It is well written by two men who know the game from the grassroots level up to the international without making presumptions or patronizing the reader. It kept me entertained and educated throughout. Definately worth the time and money from the greenest of rookies to the wylie vets."
1,a completely irresponsible publication,"You'd expect a book that sells itself specifically as an exam prep book to present information accurately. Unfortunately, this book is so full of inaccuracies and missing information that it's hard to imagine anyone successfully passing the exam based on the information in this book. One example: chapter 2 mentions hashing, and explains that it's used on FAT partitions, but doesn't describe the hashing algorithm. In the chapter summary, they say to expect a couple of hashing questions on the exam. In the review questions, they ask you to hash five file names, and when you turn to the answers in the back of the book, ALL FIVE are done wrong! A breathtaking example of ineptitude! On and on it rambles, with useless diagrams, missing information, skipping over important concepts and emphasizing unimportant ones. On the plus side, it's well written, and easy to follow. This is a book that cries for a proof-reader."
2,"Lots of broken links in the ""Interactive Study Section""","There is an Interactive Self Study Section which comes with the CD-ROM. The idea is good but it is not ""Interactive"" at all. You suppose to click a correct answer from the question and it will link you to the next one. However, I find it hard to believe that many times, I had been linked to some pages that have nothing to do with the questions itself at all. They should check it before published that book. I paid good money for a ""good book"", not a ""lost in space"" game."
2,Real World Experience?,"The author calls the HP print server ""Direct-Jet"". This is not a typo, but a clear sign of lack of experience, or at least lack of attention to detail required of a writer of a book such as this..."
2,Good but many mistakes,it could be good but unfortunately it isn't. many answers in test questions are fault. Others are different in the book and different in the C.D. You must respect someone who want a book to help him.
2,text seems good but too many mistakes in test questions,"I recently evaluated 6 different books for our staff. I waited for this one to be released, because the advertising was so good on it. When I received it, the text seemed good and well written, but the test questions, in at least the first two chapters have several mistakes in them, and the CD which only duplicates the questions in the book has additional mistakes that don't even agree with the answers in the book and the CD is organized terribly. I think they were in too big a hurry with releasing this and need to get a second edition out, or offer a better testing mechanism on CD for people who bought it."
2,"good gate, wrong advertised size!!!","I received this gate hoping to replace my current gate that is too narrow and leaves a gap wide enough for my small dog to escape. The current gate is 34 inches wide, so an additional 5 inches of gate width should be enough to fit nicely with no gap. Unfortunately this gate I received is actually still just 34 inches wide, no better than my old one. I've contacted the seller looking for resolution and have not received any help yet. I'll update this review if they can satisfy the issue. BUYER BEWARE."
1,"I hope Chris Whitley goes back to his ""Living w/ Law"" form","""Living With the Law"" was a strong combination of song writing and cutting edge guitar work, an excellent CD indeed. However, ""Din of Ecstacy"" is well...noise. Whitley put the emphasis on distorted guitar and feedback. He also didn't focus on the lyrics of his songs. The driving force seems to be a drug culture and I'm not sure weather he favors this culture or is trying to expose it. This music is confusing at best. I'm not surprised he lost his contract over this CD."
2,Kids - don't try this at home,"Chris disappeared for an elongated hiatus after the over-hyped debut to primarily work on his heroin consumption. Judging by this album he has overdone it a bit.I quite like the sound of the album (I have always been fond of white noise) but the songwriting and singing is comfortably the worst of this artist's career. It is remeniscent of Lou Reed's ""Metal Machine Music"" in the sense that one suspects the creation of the album has an unusual and specific purpose with respect to the artistic control exerted over the artist's work by the label.Having said that, there are some gems on this disc. Notably, the acoustic tracks ""New Machine"" and ""Days of Obligation"", and the Mascis-like ""Din"". But the white noise in Chris's head seems to cloud his vision and critical faculties. Too much talent for many more of these misses."
2,symphony suprise angel clock,"Beautiful clock,very nice annimation unfortunately clock itself would not work. Had to return it. Prompt service, and refund. Would do business again."
3,Snap Circuit Fun!,"Yes, this is compatible with the Elenco Snap Circuits kits but the quality is not as good. My kit had at least two pieces that did not work when I opened the package. I haven't used everything yet. Both were obvious things that should have been caught in QC before they got wrapped up. I still like this kit because it is a little cheaper than the Elenco sets and is nice for use with the Cubscouts and my neighborhood kids science club. I buy the Elenco kits though for my own family's use. Well worth the extra dough."
4,This book is really excellent .,This book is really good for Beginners . Its easy to follow different concepts and macro porcessing was very clearly explained with good examples. This book gives a good understanding of core topics.
2,Good,"Through careful and patient reading, this book helped me learn Macros. The style of explanation is a little like a recipe book and this style made the reading for me dry. For many readers, however, the book should be very useful, for it has info not easily found elsewhere."
1,Peice of Crap,"Dont waste your time or money. You have to assemble, and most of the peices didn't fit together correctly. Taking mine back first chance I get!"
1,shipping,"This wine rack is perfect for my needs, and I want to order 10 of them, but the shipping is prohibitive. Why is there no free shipping on this item? Why can't I have it delivered to a Target store, and I will pick it up?"
5,SIMPLE DESIGN,"EASY TO PUT TOGETHER. YES, IT WAS EASY. I can't believe some people couldn't figure out how to assemble this wine rack. This isn't rocket science! All you have to do is to put a dowel into a hole. It's that simple. Follow the instructions. Use a rubber mallet to insure a proper fit. If you can't figure it out, hand it to first grader. I'm sure he/she knows how to put a round peg in a round hole."
1,wine rack,"I found this impossible to put together. The Holes were not drilled evenly and the parts did not line up. Unless you have a real workshop with vices to hold the pieces steady, I don't reccommend buying this."
4,Cheap and serviceable,"We had to shave a few of the dowels to assemble this rack, but it sits nicely in the basement and disassembled so we could transport it when we moved. It's not fancy, but it does the job. The rack is expandable, so if your collection growns, you can add to it. If you aren't so serious that you need temperature control for fine wines, this is good for storage of wine in a cool cellar or dark closet."
1,Tinker Toy Wine Rack,"While these wine racks are cheap, they are not as easy to put together as they look. The dowels don't fit well into the holes, and the racks assemble more like tinker toys than anything else. After I put one together, it still seemed very unstable. I would not recommend these."
1,Outrageous shipping expense!,"I was ready to buy 10 of these kits and would likely have purchased more on subsequent orders, until I saw the shipping charges. $50 in shipping on an $80 order is crazy.No thanks."
5,By far the best,"Being a Baritone Sax player myself, I understand whats going on here... maybe not what went on inside jeru's head, but the ideas musicaly. All in all, a BRILLIANT album. Recommended for anyone who likes west coast cool, or to anyone for that matter. A smart album, from a smart man. Thats why Gerry's the best, and always will be."
5,Truely Inspired Music,"A real feast for the senses is created by Amie Ridley's music, the mental images alone created by just listening to the music make it a wholley enjoyable experiance. The music is lively, but it is also relaxing. Clearly it is inspired by the muses, I thoroughly reccommend it. The track 'Spread Your Wings and Fly' is inspiring and creates the mental image of some great bird of prey in flight. The music is balenced between the piano and other types of intruments to create a unique sound. I would say don't hesitate to buy it, and if her second album is as good then buy that as well. I think my favourite selection on this album is 'Where Love Resides' it has a wonderful 'feel' to it.I believe that there is a site on the Internet wher you can sample this music, I think it is at something called Crystal Moon. Have a look, or rather a listen and see for yourself."
1,This book is highly insulting to women!,This book is highly insulting to women! He sexual alludes to situations that either cannot happen according to the storylines or physically happen according to human biology. This did surprised me since I have read many of her works of fiction. I cannot believe that Anne McCaffrey would have anything to do with this novel. It is highly offensive to women and is not worth reading!
5,The City Who Fought--not your father's Anne McCaffrey.,"S.M. Stirling and Anne McCaffrey mix their unique styles to form this compelling book. While other McCaffrey books are/were family-level entertainment, The City Who Fought is MUCH more of an ADULT book. The sexual tension between Simeon (the ""brain"" of the spaceship) and Channa Hap (the foxy lady who doesn't like to admit it, also his ""brawn"") definitely heightens the enjoyability. Add an ""intruder"" type who tries to muscle in on Simeon, who is ""courting"" Channa, and you've got everything a good book needs, adventure, a heroine, the aforementioned sexual tension, a ""bad"" guy. I highly recommend this book"
2,Disappointed - definately not a McCaffrey work,"I really couldn't get into this book. I am a diehard fan of Anne, and I have read 99% of her books. This was the first one that I didn't even finish. I gave it about half the book, and then gave up because of the violence and awkward writing style. In fact, the style itself was nothing like Anne's! I would venture to say that Stirling wrote the majority of this work, and I found his style to be crude at best. Although, if you are into violence, hey this is the book for you! In fact, I bet it would be really good for folks who are into that. Anyway, I found it nothing at all like Anne's books, and I wondered how much of a part she had in the writing. I love the rest of the series though, and give the series a 4 star rating. :)"
4,Good enough,"A bit monotonous, but the clarity of the image and the color of the fish and coral is all i could have hoped for. For $5, a great deal."
2,"Not Impressed, Could Have Been A Lot Better","Not sure what I was expecting but being I have a 47"" 1080P set I wanted to feel like I had a huge fish tank in the room. Well it does that, kind of. It feels like they used a much smaller tank than even my TV. You can tell the tank seems small and the amount of different fish is defiantly lacking after watching for about 10 minutes you feel like you watching a loop and not the pure feeling of a real fish tank. The quality is great and running in full resolution it is the content that is lacking. I would have loved to have seen some spectacular different tanks and seeing a lot of different fish.If you can buy this DVD on sale and want something to pop in while you have company over for a cocktail party or get together so you won't have to look a huge black hole of a large TV that is exactly what this is good for."
2,Aquarium DVD,They must have filmed a very small aquarium; same 2-3 fish swimming in circles. Also although it claims to be HD it doesn't appear to be even with upconverting.
2,There are better alternatives,After viewing Exotic Saltwater Aquarium by HD Scape I thought this would be a cheap alternative...it was cheaper but hardly an equal alternative.
5,Awsome little f;ash drive,"I had this flash drive before but it was a one gigger. When I lost it I knew I wanted to get the same one. It is great. Small, sleek looking and I love the swivel that enables me to hide the connector and keep it clean.Its small enough that I keep it in my pocket. Its made well and a great flash drive.My only wish is that they would make the Imation Swivel Flash Drive in a larger size."
4,Imation USB 2.0 2GB Flash Drive - worth the price,"I was looking for a low cost flash drive to replace a 1GB Memorex that I had been using for 4 years. I would have preferred to find a Flash Drive with a snug cap that attached to the neck lanyard - otherwise, I am prone to lose the cap. (Losing the flash drive is not an issue, since it belongs either on my neck, in a USB slot, or on a key hook at home.)Many flash drives today have the lanyard attached to the drive with a clip and string rather than to the cap. I settled for this one because of the integrated cap. One of the decorative silver ""buttons"" on the side broke off within a couple days (I had read that from another owner too), but this does not affect the performance in any way.This USB flash drive performs well, and has worked with every machine so far. I am very pleased with it. If you are getting a good deal financially, you'll love this drive!"
5,"""Great Timepiece""","I received my Invicta on Christmas, being a watch collector, Ifound the workmanship on the watch a 10. I would highly recommendpurchasing this watch, the price point is excellent.D.P.Adams, Raleigh NC"
4,Perfect Set,"After looking for months for the perfect stock pot set that fit within my budget i ordered the Gordon Ramsay set by Daulton. The set was everything i expected. Although its not quite as heavy duty as some sets, for the home cook its perfect. Its built more heavy duty then other sets in the same price range and the only way you could get better is by paying a lot more, denting it wont be easy and will take more then just normal wear and tear. Its easy storage, even cooking, and stack ability are wonderful. The wide handles make moving it easy and comfortable and each piece sets snug with each other. Its also very easy to clean."
3,Non Fiction,"Teach Yourslef Gaelic a Complete Course by Roderick Mackinnon will help you with such nifty tricks as being able to order a beer in the local lingo, or tell someone 'you are the man' without too much trouble.A little bit here of interesting about the language and use itself other than just learning some of it."
3,Quality control is lacking...,"I've had motion detector night lights before, and they were always rather bulky. These have a nice design and are quite compact for what they are. However, quality control is bad, if even there.I bought three at a hardware store... two work just as expected, the motion sensors are pretty sensitive (can detect me from about 15 feet away), and the light output is comparable to a four watt incandescent night light. One of them though, is incredibly dim, about 1/4 the brightness of the others, and to make it come on you need to be less than two feet away from it, moving very rapidly.In short, if you're interested in these, try to buy them from a local store with a good return policy. And really, that applies to all products from Feit Electric. I've had great luck with their products over the years, but every now and then I get something from them that either doesn't function properly or doesn't function at all. I think it's clear that they don't test their stuff."
2,Poor QC,"I had the same experience others had with the quality control of these lights. I bought two (hey, they were really cheap. More true than I expected), and one stays on all the time (the light sensor works, but the motion sensor doesn't), while the other works correctly, but the range of the motion sensor is only a few feet."
1,Feit Electric LED Motion Sensor Night,"PROS: more brighter than 3 FirefliesCONS: I think it needs an earthquake to activate the motion sensorPoor quality/workmanship, buy a candle its more better.take my advice Im an electronic tech. buy a motion sensor lite above $10"
2,This device is so feint it is like no light at all,"When they say feint light , they are not kidding. This device gives off so little light I just don't even bother using it anymore."
1,Flash in the Pan,Only works for a moment when first pluged in after that just takes up space in the elect outlet. Nothing I have tried will make it come on after being pluged into the wall. Don't wast your money just give it to a kid instead and you will get something for it.Norm McCall broken down crippled and in a wheel Chair in Alaska.
3,Always on in dark or dim rooms,"I'm not sure that the motion detecting aspect of this night light really works. I've tried 'fooling' it by putting different materials over the sensor, but I've yet to see it unlit in a dark or dim room. And, yes, I'm careful to check it out in ways that would not set it off... Other than that, it's fine."
1,DOESN'T WORK!! DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,It turns on as I am plugging it in and then never turns on again until I pull it out and plug it in again then after a second it doesn't work any more. Doesn't matter which outlet I plug it in to.
2,Sorry I bought it.,"The book had much less detail than I thought it would. In particular, it only had limitted coverage of the Office 2000 Object models (which I was looking for)."
5,Just One Problem...,"And that problem is that these guys came out at the wrong time. This album hit the shelves in '93, and sadly new jack swing was no longer popular with the mainstream audience. But believe me when I say that if these guys came out in '90 or '91, they would've been hitmakers! Listen to this album once and you'll know what new jack swing is all about. All the tracks are great! Songs like ""Whats Your Number"", ""Innocent Girl"", ""Try And Find A Way"", and ""We Can Swing It"" should've been hits!"
2,Uninspiring,I wonder if the couples are real or only porn stars. Very explicit but no feeling at all acting is like in a porn movie. Maybe one can get some ideas but they could have done more and show how couples can really do it together.
5,Quality Product,"This Taiwan-built vise is well made and not at all crude looking like some other People's Republic stuff. Here are some impressions:- Metal fit and finish are good, and the vice works smoothly- Threads of the vise screw are covered, which protects them from sawdust, dirt, etc.- Removable pivoting head is helpful for securing odd-shaped pieces- Metal faces are drilled for attaching wooden inserts to protect your work- The handle has rubber washers on either end to protect the knobs from damage- The vise is heavy, so you may need help mounting it to your bench.Overall, this vise is one of the few products I've purchased online where the quality actually exceeded my expectations. I would definitely recommend it!"
2,"broken when we got it, seller refused to replace it. Very bad packing.","Broken when we got it, seller refused to replace it. They would only do a refund to the card. They would not send us a new vice. We will take our business elsewhere. Terrible packaging. REALLY bad packing."
2,Worth Watch,"For its numerous inanities, though, Vajra has one scene - apart from the last one - that raises cheers. This is of a transvestite berating a crowd of on-lookers who gather around to watch a woman being molested. Heart-warming stuff, and for this the transvestite should win some sort of award."
3,D and B Review,my only concern is that there are supplementals to up grade the publication every quarter
5,ENVY is a MUST HAVE CD!,ENVY & CHERRY ALIVE are great albums by EVE'S PLUM. I highly reccomend you buy them if you haven't bought these EVE'S PLUM cds. It's a shame that they broke up. I love their music. Although Colleen became a solo artist known as VITAMIN C I still like her music no matter what. Everyone should own these cds!!DARLA
3,"Interesting and very good, but not great","There are some brilliant tunes on this disc (""Venus Meets Pluto"" is downright haunting), but overall it has not stood the test of time because it reeks of the""Alternative Rock Syndrome"" that grounded so many bands of the 1990s.Also, some of the music sounds too heavy to go along with Colleen's voice. The guitar work is excellent on this CD, but blending Black Sabbath influenced riffs with pop-type vocals just does not mix well in my opinion. The dark, brooding lyrics get tiresome too. Still, this is a very complex album and you can tell that unlike many groups of the time, Eve's Plum were skilled musicians as opposed to a bunch of kids that just picked up their instruments and started a garage band for kicks.Despite what I previously said, I like this CD. If Alternative Rock is your thang, Envy is definitely recommended. It is one of the best of that genre."
2,Weary of Lexar,"Of all the storage media I've had, two CF cards and two USB drives have both either stopped working or became corrupt and lost the data. This one went half-corrupt, so some pictures ended up with artifacts ont he lower half of the picture. Video would often not work at all if a small portion was corrupt. I've lost some memories due to the pictures that were never recorded correctly. In the end it just died completely and I've stayed with SanDisk ever since."
1,Cute face but no talent,"She has the looks and perhaps some of the moves, but how the heck did she get into singing when there are enough telenovelas to go by? A generic voice without body and character attempts some formulaic lackluster songs that, at least, are designed to have commercial mass appeal. Ho-hum. Just remember to listen to the greats and you'll know what I mean by ""mediocre""."
5,The best one yet!,"This is by far the best album Pau has made! Every song is truly a masterpiece and will keep anyone dancing and singing along. ""El Ultimo Adios"" sounds great with mariachi and even though it's a new music venture for Pau, it really works. This album will be hard to beat but looking forward to see what Paulina and company come up with."
3,Great gift for someone who wants one,My sister wanted some good gardening quotes for her master gardeners publications. Great for garden clubs yearbooks and devotionals. Amen.
4,Dental floss,The Super Floss makes it so much easier to floss under my permanent bridge. I recommend this product to anyone.
4,A great introduction to RG and critical phenomena,"This is a very pedagogical introduction to critical phenomena, and the techniques to study it. In particular, Ma really explains the conceptual aspects of the renormalization group, and provides enough steps in the calculations of some standard theories that you can fill in the lines. This book has really been my first exposure to this topic, and I am definately applying it in my graduate studies!"
2,Very poor typsetting,"I was very disappointed on receiving this book because of its poor quality typesetting. It uses a very old-technology typesetting program which is mostly courier with integral and summmation symbols added. The typesetting reminded me of the old Chi-writer version from graduate school days. It just turned me off. It would be easy enough for the author to rewrite the book with Latex which would improve it considerably. It may seem to be a shallow reason, but one gets use to seeing pleasing typesetting which facilitates reading. I would not have ordered this book if I was able to view some inside pages."
5,A CLASSIC,"This important book analyzes all the stupidities of American nationalism that have come home to haunt us again with George W. Bush and Iraq.I found it an enormous help in understanding why, once again, an American leader has dragged us into a war we don't need.Read, ponder and learn!"
2,Disappointing,Season 3 was not as enjoyable as the first 2 seasons. Some of the episodes are just too out there for me.
4,The past re-lived,"Well its not quite what I remembered from the 70's but then I was very young, what I loved most about this series was the philosophy, One thing though I don't remember the acting being quite so naff, and everybody talking so slow, but times change and Carradine was really suited to this role, although he appeared to mock it somewhat in his introduction, but apart from this I'm glad I bought it, and it will be a valuable addition to my collection."
5,Outstanding Seller,The DVD arrived in excellent condition. This rates as one of my best Amazon transactions ever!
2,Poor follow-up to Greatness Grasshoper,"Season 1 and 2 are truly excellent representations of what television can be. Caine is rational man in an irrational world, purposeful & heroic. Sadly, the 3rd series becomes extremely mystical and delves into large amounts of superstition & pseudo-psycho babble. Gone are the profound stories dealing with racism, family, art, life, death, etc. They are replaced with ghosts, 2nd sight, an over indulgence in the past, and a general decline in the quality of the stories & themes. I still bought it and will finish the series but this set can't hold a candle to the first 2."
3,"Interesting, but Macintosh-centric and dated","Don't get me wrong, this book has a lot to offer: 500+ pages of it! But it was written in 1990 and it shows.Almost everyone who has written a paper for this collection has some link to Macintosh (except for Timothy Leary of course). All examples are Macintosh based. And we're not talking G3's here. We're talking Mac II's.No mention is made of the Web (how could it be?). It does, however, make a lot of good points that are applicable for all User Interface designs.So, in general, this is a good book for it's time, but it's time has well and truly passed."
3,"Dated, but still very valuable","It's time for this book to be re-collected and updated, I think. Parts of it (particularly the essays grouped under 'Creativity and Design' and 'Users and Contexts') are very useful for today's interface design world. However there are sections (particularly the section on 'New Directions') where it feels *very* dated and really suffers from being written before Internet time.An extremely impressive group of writers participates. Including: Howard Rheingold, Don Norman, Bruce Tognazzini, Nicholas Negroponte, Alan Kay, Timothy Leary and Gitta Salomon. It's definitely worth a read, but don't be afraid (unless you're a Macintosh history buff) to skip large sections."
