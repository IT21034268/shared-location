4,An exciting read,"Roy Glenn has written an exciting, fast paced, and interesting story. Mike Black is a hero with a vicious past, and a bright future. Cassandra Sims is an interesting and unusual heroine. The characters leap off the page at you. This is a very different love story and one you won't soon forget. A must read."
4,Enjoyable!!!,"Would you believe that a cold-hearted killer could turn out to be prince charming.Mike Black known as Vicious Black in the streets because of his past becomes legit and leaving the dangerous life behind opens up a supper club called Cuisine. He becomes intrigued with the very smart and beautiful Cassandra Sims aka Shy, even though he is not impressed with her line of work. When her life is threatened and almost taken away Black comes to her rescue and becomes her knight in shining armor. This begins the romance of Black and Cassandra, meanwhile trying to find the culprit who is responsible for putting her in harms way.Is IT A Crimeis a fast paced urban read. I enjoyed the courtship that spark between Black and Cassandra. The love between the two was very believable and men nowadays need to wake up and take notes from Mr. Black. Definitely will be reading more by Mr. Glenn.TangerineReader's Paradise Book Club"
5,A GREAT READING EXPERIENCE,An excellent first for Roy Glenn filled with exciting and lively characters. I'm eagerly awaiting his next!
1,I would not recommend this book,"It's not everyday that I write into an on-line Bookstore to give my opinion, but I couldn't resist. I was given this book by a co-worker months ago. As an African American I found this sort of book to be a disgrace. We need to have positive characters, and not the likes of the people who dominated this novel. I realize it's only a book, but we all, including Mr. Glenn need to take some responsibility for what's written about us, and for us. No I do not, and will not recommend this book to anyone."
2,A Love Story,"this book was a long, drawn-out read. i enjoy some parts but i expected more action, suspense and drama. definitely a love story, i have to say i was looking for more. i do recommend it to other readers but i have to say, don't rush to go out and read it."
1,It IS a crime...................,"The cover of this novel was a complete turn-off to me, but I got past that and read the book anyway. Disappointing. Character development was poor, storyline was sterotypical and unrealistic. Clearly the author neither lived a lifestyle as indicated in his book, nor did his research well. This was a storyline reminiscent of Superfly or Shaft--although not as well done. I think that Black writers need to raise the bar--and we as Black readers need to raise our level of expectation regarding a good read.DYB"
3,Readers of the Mahogany Soul Book Club,"Is It a Crime is not one of our favorite book choices, but overall it was okay. This book had too many characters and was somewhat unrealistic, but it was funny and had an interesting twist at the end. Read this book at your own risk. (...)"
2,Characters well liked,"I found the character development strong, but the story line weak. In time Roy Glenn may have a writing career....one day."
5,PRESENT TO MYSELF,"Got this CD through AMAZON a year ago as Christmas present to myself. Great gift it was. Claire Holley is a gifted and talented singer/songwriter and with this tight little group of musicians backing her, it is a dream CD. Give a present to yourself...Claire Holley."
1,PROJECT,"This is a classic case of a person with a lot of raw talent for singing and playing but with no talent for songwriting...yet. Although well produced and engineered, there is not one memorable song on this CD. The lady doesn't know how to write ""hooks"" for songs; and until she learns, her efforts are going to go in one ear, slide straight through the brain, and go out the other ear -- without sticking anywhere."
3,Pure Vida decafe coffee,Excellent coffee baens if you want to grind your own. Reasonable price and helping the coffee growers to improve their profit margins.
2,Disappointing remix,"I have two audio cassettes of the original version of this I purchased in thrift stores. I wanted to see what the deal about Billy Idol was. I learned to like him.I'd have to dig out a tape to be sure- but I don't remember the reverb/echo being so strong. I could run the original thru my old stereo guitar effect unit and give it this sound. Or my TV surround stereo could do the same.Re-equalizing (tone) and gratuatis reverb DOES NOT a good remix make.....All could have been well, but cheaply applied effects (REVERB)...Do NOT a good remix make.Get the original."
2,Good Music Ineptly Remastered,I like the music on this album a lot. (I bought the LP in 1983). However the sound of this CD release is uneven. Several cuts are too bass heavy and there is pronounced harshness to Billy's vocals in the upper midrange / lower treble. To be fair some of these defects may be in the mix - also the LP release also was a tad bass heavy but not in a bad way.
3,Mixed feelings as I like the raw originals and not remixes,"The remasters are needed to make this a full album now...I get it, but when it came out EPs were ok as a release, the originals sounds fine."
4,Am I back to 1983 already?,"Even without the remastered version (which I doubt really makes the album sound THAT much better), I can still say without a doubt that I miss the production values of yesteryear (thank you, Keith Forsey). And while Billy's only other near masterpiece (Whiplash Smile) is still out of print, this is a reminder of what music can sound like when an artist is still hungry.The singles are better than the rest of the album (especially ""Crank Call"", which is a total b-side), but that's fine because they are fantastic on their own. From the smokin' title track, to the bass-heavy ""Flesh For Fantasy"", to the winsome (and underrated) ""Catch My Fall"", to the slithering yet beautiful baritone attack of ""Eyes Without A Face"", this is an album that still stands the test of time.His first album is also strong, but it hasn't aged as well as this one. And ""Whiplash Smile"" is much stronger, but if you're in need of a BI fix, this is definitely the place to start."
4,Great Song Man,"The only song worth listnin to is Rebel yell. Thats why I bought the CD, and Its the only good song on their"
5,Another great read from a great author,"In this fourth book of the Roselynde Chronicles series, we follow the path of Adam, son of Alinor's first husband, Simon. We meet again our favorites, Alinor and Ian, Joanna and Geoffrey, and meet young Simon. The tale is riveting - a rousing history lesson/review of the turmoil in England at the time of King John's death - while allowing us to glimpse what most noble born women were forced to put up with, while giving us a dashing hero, Adam, and a wonderful heroine, Gilliane, who learns how women should be treated when she meets and marries into this fascinating family. There is intrigue, history, excitment, and diverse characters to please the most exacting palate. A great way to spend an evening or two."
2,"Too much family, too little France and Frenchj","A younbg couple with a 4-year old and a 15-month-old spend a year in France in 1950-51, or 50 years ago. While the reader will learn some characteristics ands idiosyncrasies of the French people, he will learn little about France and the French of today. Too much about the family and their expertiences; too little about France and the French, and all of it 50 years old."
3,A Year in Montpellier,"I like John Littel, the son, for loving his mother so and for (the idea of) writing this book. Sadly for me, I did not always enjoy reading it. I was frustrated with it. And I found myself so annoyed at the husband! Here is a woman married seven-plus years, and she still can't tell if her husband ""is kidding or not."" Here is a couple that never seemed to speak with one another. It's dated, one might say. But, I don't think so. His constantly telling her how stupid, slow-witted, and ineffective she was -- and her skipping over it -- drove me nuts. I have been to Montpellier; it was wonderful visiting it again. But I suffered for this woman, and her inability to ask for and obtain any parenting help at all. Maybe that's how some families operate: in France or not. Now that I've made my points: read the book if only for the swan chapter. It is very funny. And Mary does get the last laugh re her friend-in-the-park, but I don't want to give it away."
4,Better than Sinatra,"This CD is for fans of the old time singers, Dean Martin,Louie Prima, Frank Sinatra. Buble has been compared to Sinatra but Buble can really sing. This is a great CD for relaxing after a hard day. I would definitely buy more of his CDs."
3,Am I The Only Listener Who Is Completely Disappointed?,"First off, let me say that I am not musically talented myself so anything I have to say is strictly my opinion. On that note, I am disappointed with this new album. I purchased the special edition CD because I wanted ""LOVE."" I truly love this song. Nat King Cole sang this, right? I thought it was okay. The very best song is ""Everything."" I could listen to it all day. The rest of the album is mediocre. I don't like when Michael Buble sings with other people... it's distracting and he just doesn't need the help. I have two other Michael Buble albums that I like very, very much... self-titled album and ""It's Time"". These are definitely worth the money but this new album was not nearly as good. I hope Michael goes back to the sassier and jazzier songs on his previous albums instead of the sad and depressing ones on his new album."
4,"Not my favorite, but still good","Irresponsible isn't my favorite Buble album and to be frank I was a bit disappointed when I first heard it. However, that said, it is still a great cd. It has grown on me, although the first half of the cd feels a bit flashy (they are called classics for a reason). I love Buble's original piece Everything and the title track is everything I have come to love about Buble. Also there is a great rendition of Willie Nelson's You Were Always on My Mind. I would definitely recommend this cd to any Buble fans. If you are new to the MB experience I would suggest starting with one of his earlier albums."
3,"OK CD, BUT NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS ""IT'S TIME""...","... although it does have its moments, especially with ""It Had Better Be Tonight"" - that one's a grand slam home run that's guaranteed to be a live performance favourite when MB hits the road on tour.On the flip side, his remake of ""That's Life"" is a clunker that could have been a smash with a punchier arrangement putting the emphasis on the horn section - the gospel-influenced approach was simply a badly-concocted idea (heck, even David Lee Roth, of all people, did a better version).But I've noticed that about Michael Buble; his remakes are either fantastic or outright throw-aways. So far, ""It's Time"" represents the apex of his career."
2,Frank Bubbly,"I kept hearing the name Michael Buble and finally checked him out. Heard ""Always on my mind"" on his MySpace page and was blown away. Loved his older hit ""Home"" too. Took a chance on this album when I saw it at Starbucks. Listened to it and....Please don't try and be a new Frank Sinatra, just be yourself, Mike, you got the chops, as you clearly show on the sublime ""Always on my mind"". I never tire of listening to that track, but skip alll the others. My ears were bleeding listening to you butcher the Eric Clapton tune ""Wonderful tonight"".The production is superb - big points for that: 1 star. 1 star for ""Always on my mind"".I wish you would have recorded an entire album of new classic sounding tracks a la ""Always on my mind"". That would have been a 5 star album."
2,Ssthufferin' Shtuccatash!,"Stho, I thought I wasth listhening to the new Michael Buble Thee D, but insthead I got Sthylvesthter and Baba Wawa'ths offsthpring! It sthoundths like he justhst had dental sthurgery or bracthesth insthalled right before the recording sthessthion! I have histh other Thee Deeths and I've stheen him in concthert, but never, ever experiencthed thisth annoyancthe!!!Very difficult for a music lover to bear. I can't believe that the producer would release it."
2,Call me irresponsible',"I'm sorry but I don't understand. If people want to hear this genre why not steer away from impostors. I think if Michael Bolton and Kenny G. had a baby it would be this guy. Maybe the masses don't hear original, real music so they like this and at least they are exposed to the style and songs but...why go for the impostor?"
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could,"I am so sorry I wasted my money on this album. His lisp is so bad I cringed every time I anticipated an ""s"". The song remakes are terrible. The music is annyoing. If you feel you must buy this album, I suggest borrowing it from the library or a friend before you do."
5,Michael Buble' Call Me Irresponsible,excellent. very nice and easy to listen to. I love Michael Buble's smooth voice and vocal style.
5,I live Michael's choices on this album,I listen to this in my car and it relaxes me on my travels. I just leave it in as one of my choices of discs
4,"The best is yet to come... I believe you, Michael!","Michael Buble's first two albums introduced us to him and his genre... he brought swing back, at least to many of us for whom swing was the stuff of decades ago. With this album he expressed his desire to make it different and yet something he'd be proud to give his listeners, and I think he has succeeded. Call Me Irresponsible sees Buble putting his own spin on old classics and ballads, and adding a few of his own compositions.For those who've become accustomed to the sound of his first two albums and are doubtful of hearing something new, as I was, listen to this with an open mind. With bossa nova, acapella, Latin flavours, R&B; and even a gospel choir in the mix, this album is innovative and diverse, yet still very much the Michael we've come to love, and more definitive of his direction as an artist. With focus and versatility like that, it's not hard to believe that for Buble, the best is yet to come."
5,Breath of fresh air...,"Buble is a breath of fresh air. His renditions of old favorites and his newer material make him the heir apparent to Tony Bennett and Sinatra. He is beginning to develope his own style in the last few years and for his own sake, artistically, I hope he does. There is certainly nothing wrong with doing the old stuff as it is great to hear once again. I'm an old rocker from the 60's, and my hearing is shot as a result so as I mellow in my old age and get used to my hearing aid MB's music is going to help lead me into the autumn of my life."
3,Spotty,"This is my first Michael Buble CD. I find that I really like his coverage of jazz standards, but mostly his forays into other genres like ""You Look Beautiful Tonight"" leave me flat. Gorgeous voice, though!"
5,Great Product,This is a great cd. It shipped on time and I listen to it ever day. A must have for anyone.
5,Greatest CD Michael has done to date!,This is the best CD Michael has done so far. Every song is great on it.
3,nice enough,"It's just what I expected from Bublè. Maybe he should take different roads in the future, unless he wants to get his listeners bored..."
4,Soothing and Relaxing Music for the Stressed out,"This is my first Michael Buble CD and I liked it. His great voice and singing style is good for my stressy days and tired evenings. For me, as long as the songs are enjoyable and the singer sound great to me, all is OK for me."
5,wonderful voice & music!,Fabulous rich sexy velvet voice!I love this CD.I have not heard a voice this rich in many a year.It is yummy!
5,EXCELLENT,An excellent CD. One that can be heard over and over again. Very relaxing and well recorded
3,Disappointing,"I found this album disappointing in that it just wasn't up to par with his earlier albums. Its like he tried to force some different lyrical songs and arrangements that just didn't work. I don't think he should just try and live in Sinatra's shadow, but this album seems like he moved a little away from what has made people like him so much, being Michael Buble."
5,Best Buble Yet,"This CD is his best work yet. Every song except one is outstanding. The only one I didn't care for was Clapton's ""Wonderful Tonight"". The cover songs and the orchestra sound behind him are awesome but the new songs he wrote are even better. The CD is very well produced as you would expect from David Foster. This guys career will really take off after this CD and I'm sure he is great in concert."
2,Call Me Irresponsible / Michael Buble,"I am a big fan and this CD is sloppy. The recordings sound unrehearsed and MB mumbles so badly in several that the only way I know what he's singing is because I already know the lyrics from previous recordings. This is his poorest CD and I am very, very disappointed."
5,VELVET VOICE!,"I love Buble's creamy, velvety voice. It is so rare to hear someone with a truly beautiful voice who just sings--no frills, no shouting, no embellishing for five minutes when one note will do. You can understand his words and just listen to his gorgeous voice and the pretty music. I think I was born in the wrong era in terms of my musical taste, but this is one modern singer that I really enjoy.Voice Lessons To Go Volume 1: Vocalize and Breath"
2,I don't buy what he's singing!,"Even though everything is in pitch, somehow I just don't believe anything that he is singing. I wish he would pay more attention to the lyrics - very sloppy - too much sluring in some of the songs!"
5,"Smooth, dependable, suave.","Buble is smooth, has a great style and sound. For anyone who likes the crooners or big band Buble is a great addition."
4,This was a gift to my wife.,"My wife is a fan and while I can't say that I am a ""fan"" per se, it is a very good album and the guy is really talented. Well worth buying."
5,Call Me Irresponsible,"What can I say, I love Michael Buble. We play it at work in the reception area so it has to be something that most people enjoy."
1,Average CD,"I really enjoy Michael Buble's music alot, but this is by far his worst CD to date. I like maybe 3 songs and the rest is not really worth listening to. I am very disappointed!!!!!"
3,Call Me Irresoibsubke,Thanks for offering this at a wonderful price and making it easy to shop and recieve the product.
4,i love Buble,I really enjoy this cd in the car and on a sunny day. The songs are really fun and Buble sounds a lot like Sinatra.
4,Great Gems,"Buble's ""Call Me Irresponsible"" is a fine set with some real jewels. He obviously idolizes Frank Sinatra & shines on ""That's Life"" with a punchy arrangement, ""I've been up & down & over & out & I know one thing, each time I find myself flat on my face I pick myself up & get back in the race."" Of my very two favorites are the opener ""The Best Is Yet to Come"" with its cheerful anticipation, ""Wait till the warm-ups are underway, wait till our lips have met, wait till you see that sunshine day, you ain't seen nothing yet!"" ""Me & Mrs. Jones"" is a tale of an affair and was a startling Gamble & Huff soul track for Billy Paul. Buble milks the jazz out of the track, while sounding quite soulful. Harold Arlen is one of my favorite songwriters; so like other reviewers, I question the lisp on ""I've Got the World on a String."" It's probably supposed to be funny, but it sounds like he's making fun of the song. Joel Peskin's sax on the track blows deliciously. This set has some great gems. Enjoy!"
5,BRING ON THE BUBLE!,"Another out-of-the-park killer album from Michael Buble! A few tasty original numbers, including the warm and fizzy Everything, round out this collection of sensational American standards, including The Best Is Yet To Come and That's Life, all sung with that effervescent snazziness we have come to love from this young Canadian vocalist. I wish we didn't have to wait so long between albums!"
4,Call Me Irresponsible,Buble is in good voice; he continues to mature in his presentation andsuccessfully presents ballads with uptempo songs.
5,GREAT CD,THIS WAS A MOTHERS DAY GIFT FOR MY MOM SHE LOVED IT THE ONLY THING A LITTLE SLOW IN SHIPPING
5,great talent,I love his music and he is making it so eazie for young people to learn of this music! I can't start my day with out listening to this cd!!!!!!
2,Michael Mediocre!,"""Call Me Irresponsible"" is, in the simplest terms, boring. The excitement and intensity seen on Michael Buble's previous albums, is completely absent here. Mr. Buble has taken that sharp edge that created ""It's Time"" and replaced it with muddled love sick slop. There are very few entertaining moments on this album and absolutely no surprises. While ""That's Life"" and ""World On A String"" are solid renditions they just aren't enough to save this truly mediocre album."
5,He's Wonderful,"I have several of Michael's cds. I grew up listening to my moms records,Sinatra, Joe Williams, Nancy Wilson, Nina Simone, and I remember one ofmy favorite's by Nancy Wilson was Call Me Irresponsible. My favorite onthis cd is Dream, it is so pretty, I just love it. The whole cd is great.Michael's music reminds me of love and romance, and that is a good thing!"
5,Where have I been lately?,"I guess I have totally been lost in this world. First I was way behind on cd collecting, forgot The Motels altogether and Michael Buble is fantastic. I have been hearing someone perform Michaels song Everything and Im hooked, fascinated to collect everything by him as a recording artist without trying to hear more of his music. Im finding myself in days and months to come and adding another chapter in my book of my life, Im moving on and going forward, not backwards. Doing it with The Motels and Michael. I want Everything."
5,Another David Foster Discovery...,This is my 'go to' cd anytime of the day. I love this artist's renditions of classics -- and his spirit and joy of performance comes through my speakers everytime. A must have purchase for any age listener.
2,"Michael Buble's ""Call me Irresponsible""","I am a rock music fan, but I thought I'd give this Michael Buble cd a chance. I enjoyed ""Everything"" and ""Lost"", two songs which were not covers. His cover of Eric Clapton's, ""Wonderful Tonight"" was not my cup of tea. If I could give Michael Buble a piece of advice, it would be for him to release of cd of his own original music."
5,This CD is a fitting tribute to the days of the rat pack,"I think this CD is the best Michael has done since his self titled debut album Michael Buble. As another reviewer mentioned it is Michael's tribute to 1960's Vegas style music. The songs blend so well together on the CD it is hard to tell the covers from the new ones because Michael once again does what he does best blend modern versions of the old clasics with new original songs. The staand outs are the songs Everything, I'm comming home in which Boyz to Men lend their voices to sing back up to Michal. Me and Mrs, Jones in which Michael injects passion and soul to a song I never realy liked before I heard his version on this CD. I am also pleased with the fact that Michael once again has the smile back in his voice."
4,Call It Irresistible,"Mr. Bublé's latest record has once again proved to be another album full of quality and quantity. ""Me and Mrs. Jones"" is one of the best cuts from the album. Although his voice is stellar, some of the arrangements could have been rethought. ""Dream"" is an example of this, Nevertheless, Michael Bublé continues to be the one voice you never tire of. He also seems to be one of a select few on the music scene who have any real talent. It's also great to see an album and an artist produced in 2007 that does not have to lower itself to the level of filth and vugalarity. It's about time someone brought back some decent music. I heard him sing ""This Guy's In Love With You"" in concert once. I do hope there is the possibility of that song making it onto an album or single in the near future. A must for any fan of good music."
3,"Its ok, but not great.","Kinda disappointing. I love his work, but for some reason I don't really like this album. The romance is lost. Hopefully he will make a comeback with something more classic, more frank sinatra-ish."
2,Wish I'd known,"I'm very disappointed with this purchase. I assumed the album would include all 21 tracks from the Tour edition (as the amazon.ca site seems to indicate). It wasn't until I opened the album that I realized it only had 13. Unfortunately, the one track I wanted to get (Stuck in the Middle With You) is one of the eight that were left out. Now I'm stuck with the album, and it doesn't have the one track I wanted. Boo-urns!"
1,Releasing this CD was Irresponsible,"Okay Michael, your irresponsible, that was to easy and this CD is sooooo bad, nothing new here or to hear. Me and Misses Jones, oh plezzzz, It Had Better Be Tonight was better in A Shot in the Dark. Such a great singer singing trite, boring, and weird material."
1,Call me Boring,"Stick to the originals, Everything I've heard of his is boring and bland. Try some REAL sinatra, or The REAL drifters, or the REAL Clapton. It seems that the only reason people buy this is because their friends do, not be cause they like music. Pop Standards covers are always boring."
1,No Frank Sinatra,Had a chance to listen to this CD by Michael Buble. Very disappointing . . . he is just a Sinatra imitator! He is NOT Frank Sinatra and never will be!
3,The Tactical AR-15,"Some good information but a lot of fluff. A lot of marketing for the authors products. Discussed some topics that could have used pictures to help to understand what they were taking about. Many photos did not have very good explainations. i.e. picture of 5 to 10 items that are not well labeled. The title suggested ""techniques for police, military and practical shooters"", the last two or three chapters had some techniques. Much of the book was history of equipment/accessories and equipment/accessory choices."
4,good for the active person,"Very nice! A little bulky, but it holds the ipod well and stays on the arm so you can work out conveniently. Easy access to the controls."
5,EXCELLENT BOOK FOR SOMALI STUDENTS,"English language being one of the most difficult languages to learn,if you're a Somali student you need all the help you can get, when studying English language and it's complicated grammar.This is a good,basic English grammar for Somali natives who need to learn English language. published by IFTIIN PUBLISHERS wich is the publisher of many Somali and English books, such us the famous AASAASI ENGLISH-SOMALI DICTIONARY,SUPER HAND BOOK (idiom dictionary,phrasebook and vocabulary builder in one) and FIQI'S SOMALI-ENGLISH DICTIONARY (for English speakers who want to learn Somali language) and other educational Books.I recomend it."
1,Ideological Bias,"If current readers want some sense of how academic writing can serve the interests of those who have and want to hold onto power, they should read this book. They can take it as a fine example of how government and their intellectuals produce stories to support their own positions and find in them the words and language they need to justify and 'explain' their actions. Kagan's enormous attack on John Kennedy (nicely refuted in recent writings on JFK) aims to shatter the idea that there are other ways of dealing with power than those recommended by the chicken-hawklets in the Bush administration. Also, there are other things to say about Thucydides than those Kagan chooses as essential to understanding war and the preparation to 'deter' it. Surely readers notice how often Kagan offers accounts of 'pre-emptive' wars?"
1,Not So Good,"I was interested in this book because I am Honduran. But I found that the author did not give an accurate picture of the country. She was completely unprepared to make the trip, didn't know any Spanish, and was constantly on edge. Her goal was to adopt a child and go back to the United States and live happily ever after. She wrote the book as if going to Honduras was a horror story, and her style of writing was painstakingly bad. I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants to visit Honduras or is interested in adopting a child from Honduras because you will get a really ignorant picture of how the country is. Don't waste your time or money on this book, it's just not worth it."
5,Pongámonos electrónicos.....,"Luego de haber hecho Canción Animal Soda hace un giro de 180 grados mostrando en el teatro Gran Rex un estilo electrónico muy distante del rockero que venían presentando.Con nuevas versiones de En camino y No existes, que se escuchan mas ""dramáticas"" y adictivas de escuchar con el tiempo, Soda demuestra que pueden navegar por cualquier estilo musical.Una joyita para los fans de Soda!"
2,Kemah Texas,"The book was different, it rambled in places. The autor went of course and it became confusing. It was an intresting change of pase."
1,BORING,"I have a huge collection of theme park DVD's, See my But I am so disappointed at wasting my money on this one. It was so boring I didn't even watch it right through. If I could give it a Zero Rating I would."
4,Beyond the mainstream acceptance of history...,"I have to say that my upbringing only included the generic mainstream spin on the Black Panthers and its founders. Having another, more detailed and most likely closer to reality, spin on the genesis and chronology of this political party rounded out the programming of my youth."
3,A Solid Effort!,"This cheerful and snappy little book offers a host of helpful suggestions for using your time and talents. You will appreciate Alan Axelrod and Jim Holtje's humor, practicality, and common sense. Their advice - which applies to people at all organizational levels - ranges from planning timely and productive meetings to using the telephone wisely. They also discuss voice-mail etiquette, the best way to start your day, travel tips, and how to improve your reading speed and skills. You will benefit from the suggestions for managing your personal time, too. Supervisors can use this book to help their employees manage time more skillfully. The book is short and to the point, and happily devoid of verbosity. We at getAbstract.com recommend it as a text that will help you save time, calm frustrations, increase efficiency, multiply successes, impress others, and please yourself."
4,Good book...,This is a great book if you already have a clue about horses and their care and keep but have no clue about the business side of it.
5,very helpful,this book has given me a start on planning my future horse business. it offers very helpful money saving ideas and very good planning strategies. very much worth the money.
3,Double D,"We found this book a good general overview for someone just interested in the horse business, but not detailed enough to do much more than get you thinking."
4,Great Book,The book covered a good range of topics. I found several new ideas well worth using in starting our business. The book was definately well worth buying!
2,Horse business skimmed over,"I felt this book covered marketing of a boarding facility. It offers simple ideas on how to make extra money but I felt this was too superficial. If you need help with marketing, advertising, and promoting this book gives you that but it does not give you the basics of running a horse business. I would reccommend instead, something written by a CPA or lawyer. There are certain things I expected like; layout and design to the best advantage, things to consider when starting a horse business, laws and taxes related to a horse business....this covers none of that so if you are looking for something in depth, this is not it."
4,A great read!,"I found this book to be an extremely fun read. I firmly believe that the foundation to any successful business is marketing because if people don't know your business then you have no clients. This book gives some creative ideas to advertise your business along with some fun money-maker activities to plan. However, it is not a very complete guide to starting and running a horse business because there is a lot more to think about when starting a business than colors and horse shows. This is why I find the title to be a bit misleading. I bought this book along with ""Business Planner and Bookkeeper for the Horse Enterprise"" and found the two books to be an extremely helpful pair. As with any business though, one or two books can not teach you how to be successful. To anyone who is serious about starting a business, I recommend reading as many books as possible about running a business, not just this one."
1,Written for a 10 year old,This book should only be marketed to those people who have an interest in horses but know nothing about them. This book has absolutely no depth in the broad range of topics that it attempts to address.
5,Ragga Dub Jungle,"This CD is not really a dance CD, or does it fit into any real category. Its related to rabble-dub, which is almost like downbeat ragga jungle with a dark side to it. It's nothing like you've heard and you really shouldnt miss it. Truly creative. One you want to pay attention to. And dare i say spooky at parts."
5,"""Outstanding!""","""This book is a wonderful, educational book that I never set down. It is full of action and thrilling excitment! I truely enjoyed it!"""
5,This Makes Me Feel Fuzzy All Over,"If you are into pedals as I am, you will be wanting to lay your hands on this. I wish they would do another one of just Mike Matthews telling his stories. I like that it shows who some of the so called boutique pedal builders are, how they started and just how small an operation some of the actually are. I hope there will be more documentaries on all sorts of equipment. This is a fun little DVD."
4,"the best of machos, i think","surprising, this cd is so hard to find in stores, seems it was only distributed in mexico for some time... it's my favorite one! chiquita bonita, beautiful song.. morenaza, something to dance to if you know quebradita... soy tuyo, very romantic song."
5,Great summary of TWR for the unitiated,"If you don't know Thin White Rope, this is a great sample of what they are all about. Whether you will love or merely like them will depend on your reaction to the singer's voice (just like some people are bugged by Bob Dylan's voice or Neil Young's or Tom Waits's). An ex-girlfriend told me that she loved the songs, but hated his voice.The TROUSER PRESS GUIDE once said that if THE TWILIGHT ZONE had a house band, TWR would be it. And this is really strange music, but anyone who loves bands like Yo La Tenga, Eleventh Dream Day, the Wipers, Television, and Galaxie 500 will definitely go for this stuff."
2,cheesy,"The plot idea was intriguing at first, however, the twist was predictable, I saw it coming with Mona's biological mother.I have some advice for the producers/writers for their next project. DO YOUR RESEARCH. How did the psycho biological mother become a social worker? There'd be background checks, fingerprinting, etc, and this lady already has a record from abusing her other children, so there is no way she could get a job like this with the access to her daughter. Just implausible, if this had been addressed, the movie would have been a lot more convincing."
2,so so,Was an okay movie when there was nothing else to watch late at night.....this is good if you are totally bored!
1,My husband and I were very unsatisfied with ...,"My husband and I were very unsatisfied with this product. Unlike latex, this material wasn't elastic and was really difficult to use. It made for a very unpleasant experience all the way around! I understand if one has a latex allergy, that this product might be valuable. But for the average user, these weren't satisfactory at all."
2,"I wasn't comfortable using this product, as the ...","I wasn't comfortable using this product, as the back of the box says, """"The risks of pregnancy and Sexually Transmitted Diseases. . . are not known for this condom. A study is being done."""" Since the whole purpose of using a condom in the first place is to avoid those two things, it seemed kind of pointless. It does stress that it's made for people who are allergic to latex, and I guess, for those people, it's better than nothing, but I wouldn't purchase it myself."
3,This product was ok. I'm not thrilled about ...,"This product was ok. I'm not thrilled about using condoms, but these weren't too bad. I didn't think they felt any different than others I've used in the past. It's a rubber...pure and simple, and I wouldn't recommend them to family for fear of embarrassment."
4,Gothic metal has it's best,"This band really have great potential they play really good music on the album Suspiria. Sure, that's not too much fresh music, it seems to be a mixture of Tristania, Theatre of Tragedy(early), Within Temptation, Nightwish, The Gathering. They have their unique sound, the keyboard never stops and the riffs of the guitars are heavy and to not forget the wonderful voice of Alexandra(an angel). It's a very contrasting music, you can call it Gothic metal but on my opinion there is a lack of grunts vocals(clear vocals of a male in Gothic metal are less interesting.)"
3,Not impressed,The band has a good sound with nice vocals and seem talented. I liked track 1 & 2 but once past that the rest of the album sounds like one long song. This is my first album by Darkwell so I'm not able to compare what they did on others but this album needs some variety. The omnidirection of this album is it's down fall.
5,"The ""Lays"" Potato Chip of Cookbooks.",I bought one for myself and loved it so much I bought one for my sister-in-law. Now she really loves me. With success like that I buy them as gifts for everyone. Now everyone loves me. Bet you can't buy just one!
5,The BEST kosher cookbook,"The Kosher Palate is by far the best kosher cookbook in my collection. I now use it exclusively because I know I can trust the recipes to come out elegant and tasty. People have been raving over my cooking because of it! Some favorite recipes include: ""Sesame Noodles,"" ""Strawberry Soup,"" and ""Oatmeal Cranberry Crunch."" Delicious!The Kosher Palate would make the BEST wedding or engagement gift!!!!"
3,Too Brief to Learn from,"When I started training in Family practice I searched for a large reference book to study from. I choose this text because it was written so well. The Language is direct, the explanations are clear and the advice is well founded. Now that I am in training the book is not as helpful as I hoped. Most of the time I find the treatment on any given topic too shallow for what I have to learn. I belive this is the result of a compromise between size and completness. I now wish I had saved my money and bought three textbooks - Harrison, Williams and Nelson as opposed to trying to find one book to cover all of internal medicine, obstetrics, and pediatrics."
1,Hmmm,"I love adventure games as in Myst, Riven ect. I should have read reviews on this game before buying it though (if there had been more than 2 at the time). I didn't care for the comic book/childish type characters. I also don't have a degree in horticulture and chemistry needed to play. I grew very tired of mixing chemicals and also plants, holding on to inventory items (3 pages) and reading subtitles which come later in the game when you learn to speak Seleneze. I played 3/4 of the game but grew bored with the story and inventory nonsense. I gave this at least 1 star for gamers under the age of 12 (with the help of an adult or 3). Oh, and if one more Selenite threw up on me, I was going to trash the game."
3,"Classy production, Assy gameplay","A decent setup promises adventure gamers a good time getting lost in space, but that quickly disappears before you can even get out of your spaceship, as the gameplay throughout is very tedious, relying on mixing chemicals and huge inventory management to pursue some of their puzzles..The artwork, voice acting, and overall production value was a pleasent homage to the spirit of the material, but as usual, gameplay falls flat of the ""experience"" Verne had wished his readers to take..I continue to applaud adventure game developers for at least taking their cues from great works of fiction, hopefully one day they will able to do these great works of imagination video game justice..."
2,Puzzles were stupid,"The puzzles are so stupid. The story is good, that is why it got 2 stars, but it's wasted on the dumb puzzles. I couldn't even figure out how to finish this game. This game is exactly like Mysterious Island and Echo in its menu and game play. It takes WAY too long to figure out which items go with which. And going back and forth, back and forth got right on my last nerve. This game is frustrating, not entertaining."
1,This DVD stinks!,And the entire series sucks! I bought this and golf and it was a waste of money and time. It was poorly put together. Watch your home videos instead or the NBA with your kids if you want to have them SEE the sport. Or take them out to play instead.
3,Disappointed,We are huge Merle Haggard fans but I won't recommend this DVD. The concert was disorganized and there was so much unrelated business going on in the background it was hard to watch. The performances were unenthusiastic (except for Bonnie Owens' solo). Merle and The Stangers are better than this so I will stick to the good ones.
2,Older Quality Video and Audio,"I bought this concert DVD thinking that, as a younger guy, Merle would have a better voice. But the audio and video are clearly old. The better concert is when he was older because the audio and video are great in that concert DVD. I think that one was at Billy Bob Texas."
4,"""Evidence"" of good filmmaking","I have been on a Barbara Hershey movie marathon for a while now, and this may be her best.Based on a true story, this film follows Candy Morrison as she fights for her life when she is accused of killing one of her friends. But things get far more complicated when a rumored love affair and hypnosis enter the story.It is a very well done film that does utilize flashback sequences (which mirrors the construction of true crime books) to engross the audience.I highly recommend this film for an interesting true story that is humanely portrayed by all, although all are outshone by Hershey."
5,I Love This Movie!,"It's very morbid but this case fascinates me. I know it IS a true story. I remember seeing this movie when I was 12 for the first time, yes I said 12. Since then I've seen it at least 15 times and now I own it. I've also read the book about the case, Evidence of Love, and I own that also. The book is very close to the movie itself, surprisingly. At the time I first saw it, I wasn't able to look it up on the internet, but since then I've researched it and that is how I came across the book. If anyone wants to see the real people and the real ""victim"", you can go to the crime library online and just type in Betty Gore or just search her name and it will come up. There was also a Murder by the Book special recently on court, oops, I mean trutv. I would like to see more about this case and would very much like to know where the people are today! I can't believe there isn't more on this case."
2,I don't see it,"I don't see where the 5 star rating comes into play, I am so disappointed in this film. I am mad at myself for spending 5 bucks on this. Not one I would waste my time watching twice that's for sure."
2,Watch Something Else,We enjoy mysteries of all kinds but this movie was not very interesting. We have enjoyed other Dennehy movies and the part he played was fine but this must of been one of Hershey's worst performances.
1,this particular dvd was not suitable for region 1 dvd players,"Seller: Bargainmovies mailed this dvd ""EVIDENCE OF LOVE"" to me. Upon arrival my dvd player (region 1) showed the following error messages on my TV screen: ""Disc error""---""please eject the disc""---""playback feature may not be available on this disc"".---Obviously this dvd movie was not compatible with region 1 discs. I contacted seller before, but did not receive any response so far.---RUDY WILLER"
4,Blood-curdling,"This story is bone-chilling, and the DVD is a good representation. The story, about a Texas ax murder, is fascinating because of the people involved, two suburban women who were friends and fellow church members. It contains all the elements of the good story, but the tragedy is, it's true. Whether or not you believe Candace's explanation for the ferocity of her attack, the story captivates you, and will definitely stay with you."
4,Nice operates as advertised,Shipped fast but was missing the manual. Unit works fine but had to print manual off of internet and worried that the item might have been returned. But seems to be 100% found a few coins first time out.
1,Pointless,The Zoolander Soundtrack has all three of these tracks and many more at a usually cheaper price. Get that instead.
5,Card game even better than the original board game!,"Settlers of Catan Card Game is a great addition to the Catan World. Limited to two players, it pits you against each other without wanting to kill the other player for building a settlement on your longest road or getting to your next placement spot before you do. You each are working on your own province and it is more a race to the finish instead of trying to block each other's move. Definitely a better game for spousal peace and harmony :)We have not played through all the expansions.....they make the game a little more cutthroat by allowing you to do more damage to your opponent. Fun....but we hate reading the rules for each expansion scenario. I do like that for about $16 you get multiple setups instead of having to buy each expansion individually."
2,A Big Letdown,"I found this CD in the bargain bin last week and bought in on the strength of Mic City Sons (a great CD) and my overall love of Elliot Smith. Unfortunately, this CD was a big let down. Nowhere are the haunting/catchy melodies or memorable lyrics so common in Smith's other work. The songs on the CD all sound alike, and like they come from the same one bad idea. If you haven't heard any Elliot Smith or Heatmiser, don't start here - my recommendation is to go pick-up ""Figure 8"" and work your way back through Smith's catalog."
3,2010 UPDATE:So Good Vegas Banned It. Now it's Out of Print!!!,"This book was so good that a Vegas casino coalition banned the it and banned the practices. Now the book has been rendered a relic. You can find signed copies on ebay, but you will not find them here. Now that that more and more casinos around the country are introducing table games, it could make a comeback. There are only two games of skill in casino gambling. Craps and Chuck-a-Luck and this book focuses on the former.If ONLY IT WERE STILL IN PRINT!!!!!!!"
5,This guy's a genius!,"I loved the narrative, yet informative style. The strategies are genius. This book is a great read for anyone! I cannot wait to win some $$$!"
3,could be so much better,"This book, along with ""Heather Has Two Mommies"" would be useful for younger children who have a gay ""co-parenting"" family situation to help other children from more traditional homes understand their peers better, but not as a aprt of a ""tolerance"" or ""inclusive"" curriculum. Schools should not intentionally introduce controversial subjects unless it is to address a certain situation in a school or class.I do not like the book's simplistic explanation of ""gay."" ""...it's a different kind of love...."" As an early childhood educator I like Rosie O'Donnell's explanation much better where she says something like ""most men love women and most women love men but some men love men and some women love women."""
1,What was the author thinking????,"Like my title said, WHAT WAS THIS AUTHOR THINKING??? I have no problem with gays and lesbians but teaching CHILDREN that it's okay to be like that, i have to disagree. I think it's completely wrong to have a book about this for children. You would have to absolutly insane to let a child read this. I'm sorry if i offend anyone with what im fixing to say. God made Adam and Eve, Adam being a man and Eve being a woman. He DID NOT create Adam and Steve, aka MALE AND MALE. My children will NEVER read this crap!!!"
2,"Trite, not a great example of gay literature","The story presents this different lifestyle in a very matter of fact way, but becomes trite and fails to explain to any depth what being gay is. The story and illustrations are very stereotypical. The illustrations are low quality and simplistic. The story would be useful for young kids with gay parents, but not for introducing this topic to other students. I did like the description of being gay as ""just another form of love,"" but it still doesn't really touch the issue. And what's up with the guys sleeping together, is that necessary?"
1,Boring,"The School Library Journal got it right in noting ""to consider for purchase because of the treatment of the subject rather than for the quality of writing or art""When this book came out, I happened on it in the library and was amazed at how much negative attention it had been getting. The book is too boring to bother squabbling about."
1,So disappointing!!!,"This bedding set looks so nice in the picture, so I ordered the entire collection...When i opened the package i was so disappointed! The pink and the yellow are way too strong (completly different from what they appear to be in the picture), the quality is very poor, the bumper is so thin that it wrinckles inside the crib and overall it looks very cheap... I'm very frustrated with this purchase and i wouldn't recommend it to anyone!"
2,Panasonic cordless phone,"I've been having problems getting the caller ID to work correctly. I had to call panasonics help line and they walked my thru this process of going to menus and then unplugging the power and replugging in the power. It's a pain.The phone is clear, however, on the color LCD screen there's a solid blue line running left to right. I can't imagine that being part of the screen."
3,Mushyroom jiggle,"These guys are increasingly getting better and better. This album is probably my favorite. Their style nowadays is leaning more towards a heavy phat groove. If you like Floater, Jolly Mon is a recommended tasting of what else is in Oregon."
2,Vicious waste of money,"I should earn an award for having the tenacity to finish this book. The thing is full of cliches and at times loses its focus in a most painful way. The only redeeming moments come when Christy, the main character, piles on the self-deprecating humor, which is just enough to get you to turn the pages.But Hampton-Jones takes the characters too far to the extreme. The mother is too evangelistic and the father is too aloof and too much a loser. It is rare that I hate every character in a story but apparently there is a first for everything. This story could have been captivating. The truth is it is crushed by plain bad writing. It's that simple.I am actually going to try and return it."
4,Another Great Addition to My Library,"I read a lot of books, and as a result I'm forced to try new authors. Many are disappointing, but Lee Charles Kelley is a wonderful find. The characters are vibrant, the dog facts enlightening, and the mysteries entertaining. I can't get enough of this delightful series."
1,"Haven't read the book, but","This is to balance out the 5 star rating that the author gives his own book. Has he gotten his relatives to give it 5 stars, too?"
1,Sorely Disappointing,"This was one of those books I threw up against the wall in disgust after getting painfully as far as chapter 34. This is a mystery with a few dog training tips on the side (as opposed to a dog training mystery). The main character, Jack Field, is as guilty of dog trainer arrogance as he accuses others of being. He's too full of himself and the method of solving the crime is too unbelievable. The jokes are lame and the sex (yes, there is sex) is too juvenile. I see in other reviews where Jack only gets more full of himself so I've decided to abandon this series early, much to my disappointment. I had such high hopes."
2,too hormonal,"I enjoyed the dog training angle, even though I'm not sure I agree with his theories. I just find it hard to believe they would work in the real world with real dogs.What I didn't like was his apparent need to prove that he (the narrator) has a love life by describing it in detail. Maybe he thought it helped to create the tough-guy detective persona. To me it just came across as adolescent."
3,Islam has been confused with Pakistan here,"This book, as it seems, has put most of the blame on the Islamic Laws and has generalized the whole society which is quite frankly, a dumb thing to do. Feudal system in Pakistan is full of flaws and should have never come into existance, but to confuse the feudal laws with Islamic laws is not acceptable. Moreover, the author has exaggarated alot, putting all the blame on the other characters, which is quite disgusting at times. Miz. Tehmina should have realized that before giving such exaggarations, she should've foreseen the consequences of people other than Pakistanis reading this book and getting altogether the wrong picture about Islam."
1,she has exaggerated alot,The feudal lord that miss tehmina Durrani has written about is a well known and respected figure of Pakistan who has been vindicated of all allegations put foward by Mis Tehmina Duranni by the Law Courts of Pakistan
1,Pathetic swan song of a has-been Bluesman,"Don't be fooled by the reviews of Skip James' later work - it is but a terrible and pale imitation of his 1931 78's, and even those, while some are outstanding, contain a share of duds. His 60's recordings are universally mediocre-to-awful; though this collection has the best of a bad lot, it's still not worth having. His guitar playing is languid and sloppy, and for the piano pieces, forget it. It's a sad rip-off by a sleazy label, cashing in on an inflated reputation. Buy the Yazoo set, and don't be sorry."
4,Awsome,I think Play is absolutly ecstrodinary and wonderful but they should not were funky cloths and act older then they are. I just think the way they are is just as good as acting 19. lots of care Regina
2,Sounds like everything else,"The group Play are touring the malls all over the U.S hoping to get big. The problem is, they ain't got anything that's special. UATW sounds like every other pop song, it's not special in any way. What they need is something that's better than everything else, and I don't see that coming.. they will last for a year, max two years. I hope they'll have a ball during those years, but they will not last, unless they get some kick[ing] songs to sing."
1,PLAY WIT ME!,"WOW! A female dream street! But, you cant tell the difference..trust me! This is so annoying!"
1,There Horrible,"Play can't sing. And if they can, it's average-nothing that should have earned them a record deal. Their songs are ridiculus and to 'cutesy'. And on A Walk In Your Shoes, when the kid was meeting Aaron Carter and got to meet Play (whom was an opening act), I was like, SICK. These are girls who can't get their driver's license, look sickengly thin wearing thoose hoochie clothes. Quit trying to grow up, girls-live your childhood. And please, for the sake of all GOOD pop music, don't put out another CD!"
3,hmm...,"These girls are good, but nothing unique. That is probably because the group just started out. The uniqueness will probably grow as the group grows. They sound like ""another"" pure pop CD put together by a bunch of choir girls.But their voices have that ""magical"" sound to them, and they harmonize very well. As they say, their sound is ""pure pop with a touch of R&B.;""The songs are all catchy and fun tunes. Especially ""To Live and to Die For"" and ""Is it Love"" are easy to sing along to and like. I think what bothers me, is that these girls are 12-14, and that they themselves are too young to be able to relate to some of their own songs, such as ""Boys Lie"". You will have to go out with a number of boys in the past to come to that conclusion with supporting detail. It's like, you're sitting there going, ""what do they know?""They've got talent though. We should expect some good things from them in the future."
5,Amazing!,"I am a huge fan of pop music, and this totally blew me away! These four girls are amazing! Their song ""Us Against the World"" is really catchy and bouncy. I love it!"
5,Better Than Britney,These Girls are awesome !!! I have never seen anything like it .I first heard the song on the movie Holiday In The Sun.This song is a very fun and upbeat song I can't wait until they release their c.d.
1,too basic,"This book does have tapes, and gives you patterns, but I can't express how little you can say after going through it. The only Apache manual I know of so far, but still too little."
5,Wonderful resource,"I am a great fan of the ""Approaches to Teaching"" series. As a teacher of honors and advanced placement literature courses, I am always looking for ways to challenge my students and broaden their appreciation and understanding of literature. These books, especially the text on Jane Eyre, allow us to look at the book from various perspectives. My class particularly enjoyed the discussion of the narrative voice in Jane Eyre. If you are looking for a way to add depth to class discussions, you can't go wrong with this series - they are the staple of my personal reference section and I refer to them throughout the semester!"
4,NOFX are not sell outs,"i think that this is not to show NOFX went sell out. read the inside cover of pump up the valuum and you can see that there message is that they hate all the pulicity. i think that they were just trying to show more people that they are good with these four great songs. fat mike always says that he hates publicity and thats why he doesnt do interveiws, radio, or tv stuff. no doubt this is a great single"
1,JUNK,THIS WAS JUNK CAME BROKEN CAN'T EVEN USE .............. BELEVE ME DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS ONE.
1,Locking Mechanism Broke,"This lock worked great for the first 90 days, then it started to get difficult to lock and unlock. I used WD-40 as described to lubricate the locking mechanism but it did not help. After 90 days of light use (2-3x per week) it would no longer unlock even after trying several keys. I then called the 1-800 number for customer support during normal business hours 2x and got a voicemail machine.I would not recommend this lock. But I have also stopped purchasing from Onguard in general given their lack of live customer service.I am now purchasing a Kryptonite lock and will see if that works better."
5,Great action series,Best action series in a long time.I could not stop watching it.Went through season one and two in a week.Now waiting for season three.
4,Like the action,Blu-ray has better pictures. I have been waiting for this and finally got the copy. Love the action and the story line. Looking forward for the 3rd season Blu-ray
3,Can someone please explain . . .,"Why is it $14 cheaper to buy this as a region 2 DVD from Amazon UK, when region free DVD players are readily available?"
3,Geared towards endurance athletes...,"I enjoyed Loren's first book so much I thought that this book would be an excellent addition since the title suggests it is for athletes. The book is geared mostly towards those that are involved in endurance sports/multi-sport athletes. Being a powerlifter/bodybuilder for a number of years, I was hoping there was going to be some insight in how to apply the principles for losing unwanted bodyfat, but this is mostly about maximizing post workout recovery and performance during workouts, not so much as how to become a leaner athlete. While it was an interesting read, I would probably choose his first book over this one."
1,Not what you think,"This book was a bust for me. Most athlete diet books break down nutritional suggestions by sport. I compete in Muay Thai Boxing so I was really turned off by the constant references to endurance athlete. So be aware, this book is really aimed towards endurance sports.Also the fact that it's not a true Paleo diet. There are recommendations to include sports drinks/gel, rice or potatoes for its glucose content which will aid recovery after training. As far as I know some tubers & grains are highly debated among Paleo dieters because of newly found research. But that's a whole other issue. There are also recommendations for whey protein (which is a byproduct of cheese) but Loren does suggest egg white protein as a substitute.Here's what I found usefu out of this book.+ Some good info on nutrition timing. Which are broken down in stages+ Good chapter about Over Training+ Explanation of fatigue,lactic acid & cramps"
2,Paleo Schmaleo,"What a fizzer. It took Cordain 300 pages to rehash his original book, and has added nothing new. Expecting some leading edge athlete nutritional advice? Dont look here - its the same old/same old, been there/done that in the Paleo Diet book. Cordain might be trying to squeeze out some mileage ( and some more bucks) from his original book methinks.In fact,there is nothing 'paleo' about it. If you take Cordain's advice, you're eating meat and veges, then carb cylcling with 'certain nonoptimal foods' (page 163) meaning all the stuff he previously decries as 'non-paleo' (Bad) foods: 'cereal, dairy, salty foods, high fat meats and refined sugars' ( page 163).And, hey, this fab new sports nutrition advice reminds me of the Body Opus book, the TNT Diet book etc, written years previous to this. Been there, done that. Copy cat."
2,for endurance runners,"this book is mainly geared towards marathoners and the like. if you are not an endurance athlete this is not a great book. it is certainly not geared towards athletic persons in general. i am a kick boxer and found this book did not apply so much to how i train. it is a good book, and i agree with its basic principles. but i do not do triathlons, and did not find this book helpful."
4,"Same Book, Different Cover","If you didn't buy the 1st Paleo Diet Book, then this book is great. It goes over why our body doesn't function correctly by eating processed foods like the first book. There are certain elements and key points the author goes over that should be part of an athlete's diet. I felt many points were mentioned in the 1st book and the Paleo Diet for Athletes book. The Athlete book was just a regurgitation. There are so many foods that are listed that aren't good for our bodies. I now hesitate to eat anything off the supermarket shelves. I stick to the fruit and vegetable aisles though not every kind of ""fresh fruit and vegetables"" are good for you."
3,A little too much,"Well written book, but I think it was written for the .00002% of the population competing in ultra-marathons and the like rather than your every day athelete. If you're not regularly placing in the top five in your Ironman class, spend your money on the first book."
4,Helpful read for endurance athletes,"I thought this book was very helpful and believeful and I started out as a total skeptic. I think think these principles are sound, although I find them hard to follow. This book is very easy to understand, even for a lay person and many sports 'self help' books aren't. I find that this book gives enough scientific evidence that makes it good, but not so much that its boring or hard to understand. Definitely a must-have for endurance athletes' reference collection."
5,Kindle,I love my kindle app. It syncs bookmarks between my phone and iPad. I can mark pages to be looked at later. Love it!!!!!!!
4,Very informative,If you are a biologist or come from a science background I think you would find this book very interesting. If you don't like me some parts are hard to grasp
4,Didn't cavemen die young?,"I loved this book and learned a ton from it but I used it as a tool to form my own opinions and not as a bible. Just because Cavemen did it doesn't mean its how its supposed to be. I agree with all the info on processed foods but not everything in here makes sense to me just because a race of people who rarely survived into their thirties used to do it. I loved all the info on Omega Fatty acids and the breakdown and understanding of Proteins, fats and Carbs.The recipes were a bit weird too. Definitely a tool for the toolbox but don't BE a ""toolbox"" and think it the gospel of eating."
2,Joe Friel good Book - not so much,"I respect Joe Friel, but this is a text heavy, dense tome - not nearly as practical as it needs to be for any reasonably experienced athlete. KISS."
2,Carbo drinks and jels in Paleo times,"If Paleo people were so fit and healthy why do authors of this book put so much empahsis on importance of sports drinks? How about soda bicarbonate to improve one's performance, or caffeine? So where do we draw the line? Either promote NATURAL way of nourishing our bodies or lets have a list of supplements (as long as they are still legal) to give an athlete the edge. Too bad our ancestors did not have access to energy jels."
2,different diets,I didn't think this book was an easy read. I think many other diet books flow better. I can't imagine eating salmon for breakfast every day!
4,Very focused on endurance athletics.,"I was excited to try the Paleo Diet in conjunction with a general fitness improvement plan. However, I was slightly disappointed by the fact that the book is focused almost entirely on endurance athletics. Barely a mention is given of Paleo in conjunction with weight training or general weight loss.The book does give lots of details for implementing the Paleo way of eating for intense athletes, so it's a great book if you fit that category.Regardless of fitness level, there are many tasty sounding Paleo recipes in the book, so it will be a good companion to the original Paleo Diet book even if you're not a high-volume athlete. But for beginners, I would recommend the original Paleo Diet book first, because it is geared more towards general fitness and weight loss.And one thing that I like about both of Cordain's books is that they have an extensive bibliography of references, so you can be sure his research is backed-up with lots of research."
2,The Paleo Diet for Athletes,If you are an endurance athlete this is great and thats what the title should be. If you are a strength athlete this book is not for you. Would not have purchased had I known.
2,not what I expected,This book was too technical for me and didn't have enough recipes. I'm still learning about the diet but not an athlete so wasn't for me.
5,A True Martyr,"I had gotten this book from the library several years ago for reasons I cannot explain. I saw it and felt drawn to read it. It paints a complete and beautiful picture of Fr. Capodanno's life. This was the first I had read anything about this man and I found it truly inspiring. When I became caregiver for a blind, wheelchair bound x-Navy Corpman, I relayed some of the story to her and she wanted me to get a copy of the book to read to her, one that she could keep in her collection of books. For her it brought back many memories and she found Fr. Capodanno's life inspiring, as well, which meant a lot to her since she is stuggling through her own battle. It is the only book I found on Fr. Capodanno and I would recommend it to anyone who longs to read about a person who is filled with intense spirituality in this modern world, a man who gave his life for those that he served, a true martyr."
5,Fr. Capodanno,"I had read the book Battlefield Angels and Fr. Capodanno was described as one of The Battlefield Angels who ministered, along with the corpsman, to His Marines. My fiancée served Mass twice, on the battlefield, with Fr. Capodanno. I became intrigued about him and looked him up on line. The book was not about the Battles fought, but the caring and love this very fine man gave to His Marines. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."
4,My Friend and Most Unforgetable Person I Have Known,"My name is Ray Lowry and I was the last Catholic priest to see Vince alive and the first to see him dead. On 6 Dec. 1966 Vince and I changed jobs; I went out to 1/7 on the Batangan Peninsula and Vince replaced me at 1st Med. Within weeks of arriving in Vietnam I had heard stories about Vince and he indeed ""became a legend in his own time"". His CO at 1/7, Lt.Col. Buzz Lubka, told me that Fr. Capodanno ""could walk on water."" He was an inspiration to me and made me a better Chaplain for knowing him. I'll never forget the night he died but that is a story in itself. Fr. Mode has indeed captured the essence of the man. I still think of Vince daily. I am honored to have known him and to have shared my life with him as a Chaplain with the Marines in Vietnam. May God grant his noble soul eternal rest"
4,This priest is one manly man,"To be fair, I was privy to this story (of this hero of a priest) prior to the publication of the book, since I met the author as he was working on it. Many years later, I chuckled when my sister actually called me up to say ""Dude, you've GOTTA read this book!"". She knew I would be impressed by this manly man priest (as I had once studied for the priesthood). When I told her I knew about the book and the author, she was happily shocked and said that I better get this book or else! Knowing the extensive quality of research and hard work that the extremely qualified author put into this book, I cannot recommend it highly enough. You will NOT be disappointed. Well written, very well researched and presented. This book really was the first to put the larger life of Fr. Capodonno out there - so many have come to know about him from the development of this work. Buy it! Read it! Be inspired! And know the author is a solid holy and dedicated man and priest himself!"
5,SERVICE AND SACRIFICE - INSPIRATIONAL,"A wonderful book about a truly inspirational priest who made the ultimate sacrifice for his ""Marines"". Father Capodanno came from an ordinary background and family, and was obviously destined for great things in this life. Father/Author Mode not only related the heroism of ""The Grunt Priest,"" but also explained much about the War, the miitary, and even day-to-day activities when the men weren't fighting and continually fearful for their lives. Padre Capodonna was dedicated and died for God and country. Semper Fi and rest in peace."
4,"Very, very good, all I actually dislike is the price","I bought this single because it had some Enya tunes not otherwise available (May it be is on The Lord of The Rings soundtrack)and was pleased with each song. Enya can do very well and this CD shows it, if you like her work you'll probably want it. I'm not sure which one I like best (May it Be?), but my one complaint is the cost,[price] for three songs is so very near the cost of an album with four times as many songs on it."
4,May It Be,"'May It Be' which is played at the end of the first of the LOTR films is a beautiful song, one of Enya's finest. The second track, 'Isobella' is equally as good, rather hymn-like with lovely bass notes. The final track 'First Of Autumn' is an instrumental which I found repetitious and rather disappointing. The CD is still worth buying though!"
1,enya-lord of the rings,a total rip off for the money. had less than 10 minutes of music on it for the price
5,may it be,"beautifuly done...harmoics, back ground, and dynamics just right...enya has a beautiful melodical voice to capture the storey she sings...also from celtic women, lisa kelly does a beautiful job as well...my grand son has all of the music from lord of the rings series...good work..."
4,Beautiful...but short!,"I bought this CD using a gift certificate, so it doesn't bother metoo much that there are only 3 songs on it! They are beautiful pieces butI might not have paid full price for them otherwise."
2,Poor quality China-made copy,"Advertised as US made, this is actually made in China, as indicated on the label on the ricer itself. There is way too much clearance between the moving ""presser"" and the perforated body of the ricer, so 20% of the potato squeezes out around the presser rather than being forced through the ricing holes in the basket. All this ""bypassed"" potato must be laborously scraped off the back of the presser and fed back into the basket. This scraping needs to be done EVERY time a potato is loaded into the basket! Another example of a poor quality Chinese copy of well-known tool, made by people who have no idea of how the tool is supposed to work, and have obviously never actually tested the tool by ricing a potato. After one use, I returned this poorly-made tool."
2,A dry read,"There is a lot of information in this book, but it is not that interesting to read. It may be best at fixing a shooting problem that you are having, rather than as a general interest book. The author has a tremendous amount of experience, shooting thousands of birds per year. I love hunting, but I wouldn't enjoy shooting that many birds every year."
1,Disappointing,"This book is full of the author's war stories and anecdotes but does not live up to its title by any means. I did not find it particularly useful as you have to wade through these stories to extract the useful information. As an alternative, I recommend any of the Orvis guides as they are more practical and well-indexed."
5,Music,This is a really good collection of music. It has been great for dinner parties like Christmas or just tea
1,Awful product! Straps broke within 1 hour of using it! DO NOT BUY!!,Straps are just sewn onto the vinyl-style material.....easily & QUICKLY RIPPED away from side and chair is USELESS as a back-rest at that point! Terrible product!!
1,Poor Quality,One of the straps pulled loose from the chair the first time it was used. Another strap has come partially loose as well and this is just from one time use.
1,Expected more from Pelican,"Bought this item for canoe and after about 2 hour on the water strap tore out of back of chair! I am not very large guy either 6' 180lbs. I also sent the other back as after looking at it, not sewn into any thing but fabric covering set back. I have used Pelican procucts for years but this one is made by product by someone else. Do Not Buy This Chair...I ordered a different one and the return dept at Amazon are great. I will let you know how new on works!!! Better I HOPE!!!"
1,Terrible,"Amateurish writing, hysterical characters -- each one a cardboard cutout unto itself. This book was written in 1977, but that doesn't account for its low quality. It's simply not well-written."
5,Nice gift,"Not my cup of tea, I'm a NC State Wolfpack fan, but my niece, in graduate school at Carolina, seemed to like it."
1,When does the fun actually start?,One of the worst games I played in recent years. We picked this up over burnout with the expectation that it would satisfy. It had the look of the twisted metal series. It's need for speed meets twisted metal and it sucked at both attempts. After unlocking everything only to find about 5 cars to choose from and a worse selection of maps made for one god awful reck of a game. Forget you ever heard if this game and get burnout instead!
2,after burnout they all float,"Burnout just destroyed all the chances of me ever being satisfied with car games, but come on this game was garbage"
2,Doesn't work with Microsoft wheel,"Let me start off by saying that I am lousy at driving games when using the hand controller that's why I bought a Microsoft Xbox wheel. This is the first driving type game that I could not get to function with the wheel. Even games that don't say they are compatible with the wheel will usually work fairly well. I could mot get Full Auto to respond at all, it won't respond to any of the buttons even the start button. It's kind of strange because the wheel is basically a modified hand controller, I guess the game somehow senses it's not.Anyway, it's probably a fun game just don't try to use it with a wheel controller."
4,Great game!,"I waited to pick this up until it hit $10 because of mixed reviews. I think this game's success suffered from all the comparisons. It's not Burnout or Twisted Metal. It has its own style and is a steal at <$20. The racing is solid, it's challenging to unlock everything and get all the medals, and the weapons and destruction are a blast! With all the weak racers out there it's a shame a gem like this has been overlooked."
4,Cool game,"Lets blow something up...or you know what...lets blow everything up...yeahhhh...I like to start by saying that burnout & need for speed are in a league of their own...but if you include guns this game is in its own league...the weapons are sweet and the cars are pretty cool...I think the makers of the game could of done a little better with the way each weapon blows things up...dont get me wrong you can tell the difference between the weapons but they all seem to blow the crap out of everything...I just think there could of been more defenition and difference in that part...All in all its worth it if you dont wanna get real serious like burnout, etc.. If you wanna blow alot of stuff up and just wanna let the mind rest a little then this is perfect...The price is great too......7S"
3,STALE CAR COMBAT! 5.75 OUT OF 10,"I can't help but pick at this game because of how much it disappoints me. Unlike great car combat games like Burnout and Flatout this game underwhelming and a pale imitator to those great franchises. To start off, the cities you destroy feel lifeless because all you see is cars driving casually even when it's like World War III happening because of all the buildings and vehicles being destroyed. The graphics don't do much to impress anyone and really need some polish. The controls work fine, but they don't do anything new or innovative. The gameplay feels a bit stale, and I didn't really feel satisfied by my opponent kills like I would on Burnout. Overall, this game is just mediocre and not very exciting. Just buy Burnout instead."
3,No crash mode? What is this?!,"This title showcases some of the most intense racing actio around. See, its racing, but with guns. And they have this confusing thing called ""un-wreck"". The more damage you do, your un-wreck meter goes up. So, if you get destroyed, you can always un-wreck the action. This means in unconfusing Full Auto lingo, you can rewind the gameplay, giving you a second chance. This game is quite innovative and has a good concept, and SEGA manages to pull it off. But, the thing about the story mode is, there is almost no story mode. Sure, they call it ""career mode"", but all it is is more racing, but with different cars. And surely, you can unlock cooler things than new colors for your cars, right? Right? But this is unfair. The game is fairly good, and there are a diverse amount of cars to use. But in the end, SEGA in the end can't un-wreck the many holes this game has."
1,horribly written,"I'm shocked this book has gotten reviews as good as these (although at least one of the people below, josh k, appears to be interviewed in the book, so...) It's terribly written and poorly researched. After reading several chapters, I still didn't get any sense of what 'underground cinema' was supposed to be, except basically using as a word for independent cinema, as that word used to be used."
5,The Underground resurfaces!,"Phil Hall's great new book on the ""FRINGE PEOPLE""! All the facts and fictions behind the true independent movie makers; the ones that aren't financed by fat wallet investors or rich relatives. These are the loose cannons with a camera who aren't making movies for the mainstream beehives, but pursuing their own vision, albeit often warped. More eye opening than the first shot of ""Un Chein Andelou."""
4,Led Zepplin: The Making Of A Supergroup.,"I like to watch biographies, read them also, autobiographies, documentaries, etc.. I found this to be very full of information, that I never knew."
4,Pocket golf review,"Very prompt service. However, had no idea that the game did not come with a stand."
3,pocket golf,"Very disappointed on the craftsmanship of this product. Pieces on top of theboard are attached so poorly, had to repair all of them. We will make thebest of it, because the kids enjoy playing this game.Lost one of thepieces already, can't replace it. How would you order replacement partsfor craftsmanship anyway!!!"
1,Poor Quality,"The game board arrived undamaged. The paint quality is poor and the board is warped. Very low quality at a very, very high price... I guess the company is taking advantage of the nostalgia of the original product."
1,This is a piece of garbage,"If you have kids who play hard...DON'T GET IT!!!!!This piece of junk will break apart on you! It's not like I remembered as a kid. This board is a fake...I WILL PROVE IT TO YOU...I have a original that for whole 1 says 1st and then 2nd and 3rd etc. This board says 1th, 2th, 3th, 4th etc. Are they serious?!?!Move on and don't buy this. RIP OFF!!!"
2,fun game but board looks like a 5 year old painted it!,"fun game. but this product must be made in china! ours came with dried glue spots all over and the paint job was bubbly and strange looking. the game is fun, but i want to return the board to get a fresh looking one... not sure if they all look this damaged."
2,Golf carom,"The item was cheaply made, and the painting was terrible. Not the same board and we played as a child."
3,"Some good tracks, but overall just an ""ok"" electronic/hip-hop album","""Starship Galactica"" is not terrible, but it certainly has a good number of bad songs. What makes up for it are the good ones - ""Cal & Brady Style"" and ""Get In Yr Squads"", for example, are pretty good, but not great. Cex has an ok voice - nothing really notable. Most of the album is electronic-based hip-hop even though it's marketed as a rap album. The few lyrics that're found here are pretty pointless and subpar, so you won't care much for those. The musicianship is actually pretty cool in some of the songs which helps it a lot. Those two songs I mentioned are relatively original and pretty entertaining. As a whole, however, the album is merely ""decent"". Electronica/hip-hop fans might like some of this. Not really recommended.Highlights include:""Cal & Brady Style""""Get In Yr Squads""""Cex Can Kiss My Soft, Sensuous Lips""""Your Handwriting When You Were A Child In The Winter""""Friends Fall Down"""
1,TWO TRUE GEMS,this album has two true gems: track 2 and track 6. The bass line in track 6 is a real masterpiece.Trouble is that i don't like the rest.
1,Huge Disappointment,"When I was home in Venezuela, I wanted to get a CD with some latin flavor to educate my American friends, I took my sister with me to help pick one out, and when we saw this it looked perfect, both of us approved of the artists and the music, so I payed, took it home, and popped it in...The music is recognizable, but the impostors have no enthusiasm, no flavor...Overall, I considered it a waste of my hard-earned Bolivars."
2,"Not ""underground"" really top 40 house - CD length only 40:01","This is a collection of good house music, but not true underground music. Selection number one ranks only as second-hand freestyle.The CD cover misleads you too! It says ""Over 60 minutes of continuously mixed music..."" Guess what? This album is 40 minutes and one second! They have at least thirty minutes of empty space on the CD!This shall be my last purchase of a Micmac CD."
2,Not a professional mixer,"Average sound, competitive price, but you can't preview the FXs MIX - you can only solo the FX so you can't adjust the mix AMOUNT offline while you're on stage. You can preview the sound offline by connecting your headphones to MON (and a separate headhphone amp)but you get a completely dry signal - no help in adjusting FX. In addition the phones output level is connected to the main out so you have limited control over phones volume.If you connect a separate FX box to the mixer you still get Behringer onboard FX on top unless you set the mixer to a blank FX. Onboard FX are marginal and undocumented, just clustered into sets of ten.If you want to do Kareoke in the basement this mixer is fine, but if you're a professional musician it lacks flexibility and you're paying for a lot of cheesy effects."
5,A moving experience,"Ring Lardner, with his background as a sport writer, demonstrated his unique ability to mix dialogues of his characters with vivid descriptions of the scenes and plots of his short stories. The result: Reading his stories is like watching movies. This audio dramatization of Ring Larners's stories include his classics such as ""Champiion"" and ""The Golden Honeymoon"" Again, to listen to these stories is like to enjoy some great old time movies. The only difference and the better part of it is that, the narrations-the very essences of these stories, never miss out in the process."
5,Mr. Taylor can fly!,"Robert Taylor is arguebably the best aviation artist of our time, he always seems to capture that moment in time, so realistically."
5,New York Times Jewish Cookbook,"The New York Times Jewish CookbookThe New York Times Jewish Cookbook: More than 825 Traditional & Contemporary Recipes from Around the Worldcombines traditional recipes that are famous throughout the Jewish community but that are made with various twists depending on the location of the relevant diaspora but also offers many newer, fresher, more modern recipes which I like to bring to my family on various family gatherings and which are always being appreciated....a great source of inspiration to make that night even more different to every other night;-) (Yes, there is even a separate one for Passover-The New York Times Passover Cookbook : More Than 200 Holiday Recipes from Top Chefs and Writers)"
4,vicarious weight gain,"I put on 8 lbs. just reading one chapter. Like most endeavors of the NYT, it is both authoritative and encyclopedic in scope. While it sticks maily to traditional Kosher and Jewish dishes, it shows some respect for Israeli cooking, usually given short shrift in ""American Kosher"" cookbooks.It's failure, however, is one of overload, both in many of the recipies themselves, and in the number of inclusions. It gives insufficient weight to weight itself!! With so many of its readers and users in the constant battle of the waistline (and tushline), it provides little encouragement to minimalists and moderationists (new word, coined this morning).Best read during the 2 hour break in services on Yom Kippur"
4,Not Worth The Price!,I just got the book today it has tons of recipes I am just disappointed that there are no pictures in the book. The recipes are great reminding me back to the day of childhood.But I found many other Jewish cook books with these same recipes in them at cheaper price with pictures! Look around for other Jewish cookbooks on amazon. You will find a few. Unfortunately I did that after I bought this expensive book when I found out this has not 1 picture in it. This Cookbook is expensive and for the price it should at least have pictures. I rate it 3 stars but I accidentally hit the 4 star rating.
2,I never received this book.,Another Jewish cookbook came in its place and at the time I couldn't figure out what to do.I didn't like the replacement. I think I gave it away......
2,"12"" J&J Ceramic tippmann A5 Barrel","Accuracy is not so good. I could not predict how far my paint is going to hit my target with this barrel. As soon as I started using my old 14"" unknown-brand barrel, my shots improved its accuracy. I used the same paint, same setup on my A5. I use CO2-tank with an expansion chamber. Despite the good reviews that I've heard about this product, I wouldn't recommend buying this. Thanks!"
5,I Bought this TWICE!,"I actually have the soft cover of this book. And since I got the kindle, I wanted to always have it on me ready for whatever I need as sort of a reference guide. I use this book above all father books as my foundation structure. It is a great book!Ricardo Butler[...]"
3,prophecy fulfiled,"who knew? here we are in 2008, and she's running for president. it makes u sick how people forget... worst of all, bill will make a terrible first lady."
3,why she will run in 2004!,"`In Fact, it's astonishing that anyone believes Mrs. Clinton's denials that she'd consider running in 2004, given the wealth of evidence that she's planning for just that contgingency'I know it's hindsight, but Limbacher was so very wrong here. He even quotes some people who say she won't and ridicules them, even though they were right.He's biased, a clinton/hater and thinks the entire media is liberal/biased.Now some plus points1. Some of the facts are quite scary and if they are true, and I kinda fear some of them have some truth in them, they will be the characteristics of maybe the new President. Nothing new though. There are many notes in the back as well to look up the sources, which leads you to believe it might be right, even though most sources seems to be other right/wing media outlets.It is a funny book however and well worth a read."
1,Don't buy it!,"I would consider myself a conservative, but this book sucks! I wasted my money buying it,and my time reading it. In a nutshell here are the problems:1) There is no apparent organization to this book. It's like someone cut out a bunch of little articles on Hillary and loosely grouped them by themes.2) There's nothing new. I'm certainly no Hillary fan, but the book promises way more than it delivers. Unless you've been out of the country for a very long time, you will find nothing new here, no bombshells, and certainly all the claims are overblown in my take on it.3) It's not a very good read. Either Limbacher doesn't write very well (he really has no apparent credentials other than working for newsmax.com), or his editor doesn't edit very well, or both.This is a very unsatisfying book if you're trying to learn anything new!"
1,"""Plotting"" to run for president?","Who in the world wrote the ""Book Description"" under the heading ""Editorial Reviews""? Can this person be serious? Since when does planning to run for president qualify as ""plotting""? Apparently the author of this ""editorial"" and the author of the book itself must think that in addition to the ""millions"" of Americans who are terrified at the prospect of another Clinton presidency, there are millions more who are delighted by the idea."
1,"Another Clinton in the White House? Oh, Yes! Please!","To those who mutter darkly about another Clinton in the White House, you don't know just how good that sounds these days to those of us who are bone weary of the neo-con mismanagment of our country.If Hillary ran, I'd vote for her. If Chelsea ran, I'd vote for her. Hell, if Socks ran, I'd vote for that hep cat. All three of those choices are way superior to the asinine bungler occupying the white house at present. But since Hillary is NOT running, I guess I'll have to vote for John Kerry. And if it turns out that he is just a puppet of Madame Hillary, I'm ok with that too."
1,"Independent Thinker the Author Is Not, but Hillary Is!!","This book is just another example of Clinton-bashing to the point of name calling.Just a very unprofessional example of crude writing - I gave up just after a few pages. There didn't seem to be concrete examples strong enough to stand journalistic scrutiny, rather hearsay subjective verbiage. Garbage!"
1,"Excellent Book , should be classified under fiction","About the time somebody started writing political fiction.This book is loaded with one false assumptions based on other false assumptions. Even though this book claims to be an example of investigative journalism, this work represents a creative and inventive side of the journalistic profession.If you are the kind of person who thinks that Elvis is alive and touring US in the UFO making occasional visits to Vegas, you may find this book convincing.I personally found it very amusing (just like I do Rush and Sean Hannity.) Anyway this book would be a great addition to your Baseless Hate of Democrats library. If you are not completely disturbed by lost jobs, lousy economy, big business taking tax breaks, while sending jobs more and more jobs overseas, looming super-resession resulting from all this (no tax refunds wont help, you used it to pay your mortgage), and running out of reasons to hate Democrats read on this is just the right book."
1,OH NO...A woman president!!,"Why do these neo-cons want to demonize Hillary? Because it takes the heat off of their own political leaders that are worse. Right now, their election-stealing chief idol, Bush, is getting into more and more trouble and Hillary is looking more and more like a viable candidate for president, and that scares them to death. This book is filled with all the old Hillarygate stuff.I am not a fan of any one politician but these neo-con writers are living in a dream world where they are champions of truth and justice, fighting off evil female politicians like Hillary. She refuses to stay in that kitchen!"
4,It's like Scooby Doo for a slightly older audience.,"It's a fun show, but the episodes that aren't chiefly a mystery feel like scenes from a generic children's show. The mystery episodes, however, are all very good."
5,"One of the great ""Big"" anime","Case Closed tells of a seventeen-year-old high school student named Jimmy Kudo who is also a renowned detective. He suddenly gets ambushed by members of the Black Organization and fed a poison that should have killed him but reverted him to an eight-year-old. He has to now solve cases while trying get his real body back. Wow, this is one awesome series and I love how the different motives for murders changes with each episode. I have loved mysteries since I can remember and that is part of the reason why I love this series. If your a fan of mysteries or just an anime fan, I highly recommend this series."
5,Fount it!!,My son wanted this so much and it was hard to find but the quality of the DVD's was great and the shipping was fast. Very happy with it! I'll be buying all the other seasons
3,"Great anime, dubs SUCK!","I think the story is excellent, along with the anime, but the dub of the series stink! I infinitely prefer the subbed Detective Conan, which you can watch at dctp.ws because the original Japanese voices are much more realistic and somehow feel as if they are more ""emotional"". Also, the subbed versions have the characters original Japanese names. I personally think replacing the names was a big mistake, and they should be their original names. For example, Jimmy Kudo is Shinichi Kudo, and Rachel Moore is Ran Mouri. One of the only names that stays the same is Edogawa Conan. Lastly, Funimation only has a fraction of 600+ episodes of Detective Conan, and so if you watch Case Closed, it will not develop the plot properly and introduce all the characters. So, overall, I think this is a good anime, but Funimation should have released more, released original names, and actually put satisfactory dubs!"
1,Geat show HORRIFIC Translation,"this is going to seem a biased Review to some , and perhaps rightfully sobut I base it on the assumption that ""quality"" and ""Literal translation"" must be considered synonomousThe Subtitle on this show is a polite nod as they dont even include the option of changing the credits so you dont see the case closed logo (Maybe that was a neccessity of Including so many episodes for so low a price but I wish I'd known...)I'd rather own the Original and practice my jappanese with it personallyDown with Dubbing."
5,i love it,"this is my second favorite anime of all time, just behind yu yu hakusho. this show is a good one because it has comedy, mystery,drama,action, and thriller all bundled up into one show. sorry for my some what shallow description but i love this anime and thats the bottom line. so if you like anime i suggest you buy this and yu yu hakusho"
3,Literary equivalent to the energy bar,"This book is broken down into short chapters which can each be read in about three to five minutes. Like Bicycling magazine itself, it manages to be accurate and somewhat helpful, albeit completely insubstantial. I found that reading this book inspired me to ride, which is always a good thing. The subject of road cycling, however, is treated in such a superficial and scattershot manner that the book will probably be of little long term benefit. Like a cliff bar, it's sugary, fast acting, short term fuel for the road."
2,Not For the Recreational Cyclist,"This book seems more concerned with anecdotes about professional cyclists than it is with providing information for the recreational cyclist. It has way too much crowing by the author about his cycling exploits and some dubious advice (""Breathe through your nose."") There is some mystifying blather (""The modern-day road ride is a big-ring hammerfest, where style and form disappear as riders start getting blown off the back when the action heats up."") and an interview with some guy who rides 1,000 miles a week-worthless for the average rider. Some good advice about hydration and safety but not much else."
3,Great book but outdated.,"This is a great book, it still has a lot of information that you can relate to or learn from, but lots of it is outdated.I got it when i started about 2 years ago and i sure learned a lot from it, but would have preferred to get a book that talk about more recent bike stuff."
4,serious,"If you are serious about riding then you need this book. Things you might not other wise think of, to make you a better rider in everyway. Handle the bike in turns, and in traffic. Top riders sharing their knowledge, seriously."
2,Light Reading,"If you want to know little about not a lot then pick this book up. Yes, there is some good advice, but by no means a cycling bible. Do we really need to go over the menu and nutritional value of fast food restaurants?"
3,Its great to show off an HD TV,This is an old movie. I certaintly wouldnt buy it as a standard watch film. It is cool though to show off an HD tv with the WMVHD format.
5,Can't Put This Book Down!,"This book is simply a must read. The story is set in modern day Nigeria. The language is vivid and vibrant and the unique story practically jumps off the page with action and intrigue. I was so disappointed when the story came to an end because I still wanted to know what happened next. I understand that a sequel has already been written. I can't wait! I gave the book to my husband and he felt the same way. He read the book in one weekend (he couldn't put it down either.) It is such a pleasure to read an author's work that is from another country because it provides a whole different perspective and approach to life and literature. Keep an eye on Debo Kotun, this author will definitely receive the Nobel Prize for Literature during his lifetime. His writing is simply too rich and the stories he has to tell too original and poignant to be overlooked in world literature."
5,One of the best books I have ever read,This is one of the besyt books I have evr read and I hope that the author will continue to write more because he has a specail talent that should be used to its fullest.
1,TYPICAL AFRICAN SEXISM,"Interesting concept but this author's writing needs a lot of work. And his female characters were terrible. I've never seen such sexist caricatures! As a Nigerian woman, I was very disappointed and annoyed.Idemili"
1,Poor female characters,The female characters were so offensive in this novel that I wanted to burn this book. Plus the writing is very poor.
5,The Best,It brings to you the situation in Nigeria during the Military dictatorship and all the suffering and corruption that resulted.
5,Wodehouse at his best.,"In the preface PG Wodehouse explains that he is writing at his funniest, and cannot be held responsible for what occurs. And though I've read through a fair amount of the Wodehouse library, this book is without a doubt the most humorous novel yet penned by the prolific author.This book revolves around a Mr. Mulliner who resides often on a barstool at the local tavern, and likes to tell tales about all his relatives. The tales usually involve a chap trying to win over a reluctant girl in some fashion, but every story is so original and has a wonderful twist in the end where things work out for the best.I chose to read this book at work, and despite my best efforts couldn't stop myself from laughing aloud while reading this book during my lunch hour. It's absolutely hilarious, it is indeed Wodehouse writing at his funniest."
5,The single uproarious book that I've come across,"Exceptionally witty. Very relaxing -- read it on the night prior of my Ph.D. Candidacy exam at Princeton. If I had to select only one book, this certainly would be it."
2,not for all kinds of bike,"1.The quality of the rack looks good, but the mounting screw is not.It was damaged when I use a dewalt to put it into the wood.2. It fits well for one road bike, but none of my three mountain bikes could fit. The distance between two bars is a little bit wide."
4,Easy mount bike rack,"As others mentioned it says 2-bike; however it would be a challenge to mount 2 bikes on it. I went ahead and bought two for our 2 bikes. It's a simple one screw mount into the stud. Even though I pre-drilled holes into the stud, the phillips screws both failed me as the slot stripped out, so I had to find two new screws."
3,"Works well, but...","This bike rack is pretty solidly built. It has no problem holding two bikes (they will be a little cramped). It comes with a lag screw that's about 3 inches long. Easy to put up...the only complaint I have is that it tends to rotate on the wall. From an engineer's prospective, it could have used another screw...even if that other screw was only meant to be an anti rotation screw (non load bearing)."
3,storage rack,Great holds my mountain bike .....I am sure I can put two bikes on rack..but for now I have one on there
3,Delivery was late and can only hold one bike,"This package took forever to get delivered. It didn't reach me on the estimated time of arrival; it was at least a week later. It comes with one screw, so I was a little worried about how one screw in the wall can hold up my heavy bike. It works if you have it securely fastened to a stud in the wall. However, there is absolutely no way this can hold two bikes, unless you have two thin road bicycles or children's bicycles. I have a mountain bike and a cruiser. It'll hold one or the other."
5,Simple design that works great.,"I bought two of these to install two road bikes in my garage. Due to warnings I read here, I didn't expect to be able to store two bikes one rack. The racks do fit one bike nicely but I wouldn't recommend for storing two. The rack incredibly easy to install with just a single screw. I liked these racks so much I bought two more."
1,Not for two bikes!,"The only way you can get this to work for two bikes is if you want to remove the handlebars! Also, there is only one screw in the center, so it does not handle girls bikes where the bar is a diagonal....it rotates around the center screw."
3,Decent for the price,"The product works alright. I would have liked to see a better quality hardware included; I ended up using a good quality deck screw instead. I don't see how you could fit two bikes on here. I have one bike with a rounded frame that does not fit well on here, so pay attention to how similar your bike frame is to the one in the pictures. I've decided not to use this as long term storage as the bike is just too awkward on it, and instead just use it for repairs when I need to. I use standard hooks and a ceiling mount bike hoist as my long term storage instead."
3,It fits only one,"It works well, is easy to install but it only fits one beach cruiser. We had to order 2 For our bikes."
3,Only holds one bike each.,"This says it's for two bikes, but definitely only holds one bike each. Nice rack but is misrepresentative with the description. Cannot hold 2 bikes."
4,Good rack except....,Just receivedd this rack after a good bit of research....easy to install...just one screw...but rack is definitely for one bike...tried all diff ways to put two on there but no go...had mens and ladies...also mounted with my own screw since I have masonry walls....rack did turn with me as mentioned in other reviews...will probably end up sticking another screw somewhere to solve this...pretty good rack otherwise...but docked it 2 stars...1/7 - update...added 2 screws to keep rack from moving around while finally getting both bikes on there...am happy now...not many options out there for 2 bike storage horrizonally on the wall. Gave back a star..
3,"Good idea, average execution","I purchased this to hold 2 bikes, though I only have one on there now. Installation was straightforward, but because there's only one screw to hold the whole thing, it rocks back and forth a little bit. I put a screw on either side of the vertical pieces of the frame to help stabilize it (non-load bearing). My other gripe is the quality of the screw the provide, as cited in another review. I pre-drilled a hole and then used an electric screwdriver which quickly stripped the soft metal of the screw. I was able to get it most of the way in manually, but not as securely as I'd like.Despite all this, the rack held my weight (140 lbs) when I hung on it briefly and felt reasonably solid. I'll keep an eye on it for long-term stability once I put the 2 bikes on there. For someone who needs to hang 2 bikes in a confined area, there aren't many other choices out there..."
2,wall mount bike rack,The the package came in perfect condition. After reading the sloppy directions i found the stud on my dry wall and screwed in the little screws provided. After 15 minutes everything was installed and that was when things went downhill. The wall mount claim to hold up to 80lbs...what a joke. My mountain bike weighs at least 45 - 50lbs and it barely holds its weight. Now my bike is hangig slanted on my garage wall.
4,Put the Biles on the Wall,"I needed something to get our 4 bikes off of the floor and onto the wall. After researching a multitude of different options, I landed on this one because of the price and ratings. I have 2 hybrid bikes hanging on each one in my garage and it has made all the different in the amount of room I was able to create. It is a little tough getting to full-size biles on one of these stands, but it can be done."
5,Great value,"Some of the reviews complained about mounting, but I didn't have an issue. It's a big 3""+ screw, and when installed in a stud works great. The rack folds up nicely, and holds a full adult bike well. It's certainly not really big enough for 2 adult bikes. I was even able to install at a 20 angle so that the bike frame rests horizontally, just by tilting the rack and screwing it tight to the wall.I have installed a total of 3 racks, 2 for adult bikes (1 bike on each rack) and an additional rack for 2 toddler/kid bikes."
3,Almost a winner,"It claims to have room for two bikes and if you are VERY careful and move the handlebars into a specific configuration you can make it work, but in reality it needs to be larger for two bikes. Great for one."
3,Very basic reading,"I've read a few books by Marian Green and I found this one a bit too simple, even for a first time reader of this type of book."
1,horrible map,"I purchased this map because I wanted a good street map of downtown Boston which was small enough to be folded and placed in a pocket. But the street map is extremely small, and doesn't have much detail. I threw it out.Instead I sent off for the free AAA map of Boston which was infinitely better, and cost me nothing as a AAA member. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this map."
3,too small and a bit unorganized,It's an OK map but it is difficult to read because of the small print. T information is nice to have though. There are better laminated maps out there that are the same size. It works in a pinch though and is convenient to carry.
1,Laminated Boston Map,"I was excited to take this map with us to Boston but found it hard to read because the print was so small. In fact, I ended up sticking it in my purse and not using it at all because the map that the hotel's shuttle driver gave us was so much better. That map's print was large and in bright colors so it was easier to use. It was dog-eared at the end of the trip but it went in the trash because we no longer needed it anyway."
4,Good size to carry around,This is a good size to carry around in a purse. It does not fold enough to carry around in your pocket. Overall I'd say the map detail was pretty good. It had a lot of detail for downtown Boston but not much on the rest of Boston.
2,Too small !,The print on this map is just way too small for over-40 eyes! So if you're in that age group...forget this map.
2,Real house music? Really freestyle! Only 45:18 (whole CD!),"By song number seven, the CD goes from house music to perhaps freestyle. Whatever comes after song six does not qualify as house music let alone true underground.The CD cover misleads you too! It says ""Over 60 minutes of continuously mixed music..."" Guess what? This album is 45 minutes and eighteen seconds!This shall be my last purchase of a Micmac CD."
3,"Great ""real"" Photo","But for almost $100? who is kidding who. This print was offered on Ebay for a long time for under $20. What makes the print so fab? Is it the amazing frame, I would just look for one on ebay, or someplace else if you must get this photo. I can not believe that anyone who pay that for this item. Just go and see a Faith or Tim concert for that same $100. The photo isn't even autographed or anything. Not worth that price. Ouch!!"
3,order in cooler weather,the candy itself was a hit. although the quality after being shipped was not. the wax bottles had melted into on another causing one big clump of wax candy....not so great
2,A very stange candy,"They were indeed tasty, but I guess I just don't understand the appeal. A small amount of liquid encased in wax. It has a certain novelty to it, but mostly it's just odd. I am sorry if my rating seems undeserved by people who like this candy. It's not that I don't appreciate old-fashioned candy. Some of it is great. But some of it went out of style for a reason."
2,Dated writing and an unsatisfying book,"This book was somewhat interesting, but it was too full of fluff for my taste, and I felt about 20 years too young to connect with the author's point of view. His observations meandered through his (very dated) memories of gardens past, with no conclusions drawn, no linkages to culture, no gardening advice, and so on. While some of the stories were amusing enough, it left me unsatisfied, like eating cotton candy when you are really hungry: a sweet taste but no substance. Unfortunately I can't recommend this one at all."
4,Good,Got it when I was suppose to . Have been a Huge Lindsay Wagner Fan so finding this movie was awesome. Would buy from you again!
2,how about cowardly explorers instead,"I feel the message of this book could promote travel and death phobiasDecide for yourself...Six brave explorers came to Egypt alive. One discoverd a rare bird-and now there were five.Five hungry explorers looking for a store. One asked a Cobra-and then there were four.Four thirsty explorers taking time for tea. One poured for a panther-then there were three.Three explorers said, ""How do you do?"" ""Fine,"" smiled a hyena-and then there were two.Two sleepy explorers glad the day was done. "" Good night,"" said a crocodile-and then there was one.One smart explorer finally used his head. He hurried home alone and there he stayed in bed!I'd like to add that each ""reduced"" explorer is escorted in a supine position from the other ""brave explorers."" To me it looks like he's dead.I found the book shape unique and aided the dramatic impact of the pop-up. Each creature encountered is well illustrated but I have to give it thumbs down for content."
4,Another tasty fruit leather snack.,"I buy a lot of these snacks. They're quick, easy, tasty, and satisfy my sweet tooth well enough. This particular flavor, Apricot, is pretty good. I dont put it up there with the Apple or Mango, but i like them nonetheless. The Apricot flavor is pronounced, with just a bit of sour on the back end. The subscription price is really good as well, so i would recommend going that route if you're gonna buy them. No shipping, and you save around $3 to $4 from the average store prices. Enjoy!"
2,Smaller then expected funny after tatse,"I have bought several flavors of these fruit leathers at local grocery stores. I did not know that these came in different sizes. These were much smaller then the size in my local store so they were not as good of a deal as expected. Of course I should have looked closer at the size, the packing looked the same, so it is harder to tell then on something like a box of cereal. I love apricots. I was excited to try this flavor. It was not as fruity when I first ate it and the after tatse was kind of soapy. I have enjoyed the strawberry amd rasberry flavors so Im not sure it is just a bad batch. I wouldnt order this flavor again. Even my kids who usually eat these like candy didnt like them."
2,Apples to oranges,"The apricot leathers are ""All-natural, 100%-fruit leather featuring apricots"", but since apples are the first ingredient and apricots the second, I have no clue how much apricot they contain, but probably not very much. I'd be a lot more impressed if apricots was the first ingredient, but that would be more expensive to produce than something made mostly of apples."
4,"Good apricot flavor, thick leather","I am a traditionalist and the original apricot leather was about 1/2 of this thickness. Same flavor however I liked pealing the leather off of it's plastic round..... however, the flavor is very good."
5,love it,These are so good. Apricot is my favorite. I used to by these in whole foods but I can't find them anymore.
5,Original LP Formats Please,"Careless is out of print. The record company wants you to buy: On And On: The Hits Of Stephen Bishop, but it just doesn't feel the same. Record companies: THE COMPILATION MATTERS. I like all the songs on Careless and I like them in the original order.This is not the first time! I bought Orleans two album best of ""Still the One"" and all the songs from Orleans first album are on it except ""Bum."" You know... I'm a B.U.M. bum bum shadoweeee.Come on record companies print the origianls... they will sell well. I will buy them!"
1,A hero for whom?,"What does it say about the gestalt of America that this man could have remotely been considered a hero? Are we truly so blind, so lulled into bovine somnabulance that we can't separate myth from true heroism? Every GI in harm's way right now in the killing fields of Iraq has more heroism in his or her pinky than this first figurehead puppet of the Neocon death cult ever had."
1,What an imagination!,What an imagination this lady has. This book is well written but not even close to reality. The Fuzzy glaze the writer puts on Ronnie is disgusting. Try Reagan's America by Lloyd Demause or Blinded by the Right the much more informative.
1,Not worth the bother.,"Just what I like, being told that myself and the world is full of one-track minded people that can only achieve immortality by completely throwing away who we are and becoming undirected hippie-like goobers. The only good part is the end and I mean the last few pages that deal with an insightful comparison between religion and science. The rest of the book is horrid."
4,Sea Gull Lighting 2013-15,"I am very pleased with my light fixture. I had to search high and low for this same type of replacement light which was the closest match to what the builder had initially installed! The light fits nicely in the same spot (over the kitchen sink) as the previous light fixture, and looks great. Also, the shipment arrived quickly."
2,Garbage Beats... the second bonus CD way worst,I basically only got this CD because I wanted Aspire off of it with Cee-lo on the hook but the rest of the CD upset me. Lyrically the people were ok but with a beat not to move you its hard to pay any attention. I thought the rest of the music be on the same level as the song I wanted from off it but oh well.
4,Mitsu The Beats ROcks!,"okay, may be you guys never heard of DJ Mitsu the Beats before,and probably surprised by the price on the CD.well, first of all, Dj Mitsu is Japanese DJ who is known for his production skills of jazzy hip-hop.since this albumwas only released in Japan, the price is high, but as a matter of fact, the quality of this CD is really good that it is worth it.it's Jazz + Hip-Hop. Guru's Jazzmatazz was more like Jazz than hip hop, but this Cd is more like Hip Hop than Jazz.since he's only a producer, he doesn't rap.there are 2 songs that are in Japanese, but rest are all inEnglish. I Loved THIS ALBUM. Much better than JazzmatazzPlus this record is so laid back...."
4,Beautiful Candle,"I bought this candle for my daughters 3rd birthday. It is a beautiful candle that served it's purpose well. The only complaint I have is that the colors seem a little muted. Other than that, it looked beautiful on top of the cake!"
1,Worked 1 TIME,"Bought 2 for our grandchildren, one didn't work properly after the first hour of play. The second started losing air after 1 day of play. Definitely JUNK and am returning."
2,Worked 1 Summer,"Very fun when my sister and I got it. Then we put it away for the winter. Next summer, we got it out again. We had 2 of them. Ones batteries were completely coroded, and it would not work at all. The other one had enough power to power the squirter, but not enough to power the motor. Do not buy unless willing to take care of it all winter."
2,Motorized Bumper Boad,This boat really didn't work.. You really couldn't tell that it was moving at all. The age I had in the boat was from 3-6 age... But they loved the squirt gun attached to it...
5,Best Album of the Year,"I heard Ryan's version of ""You, the Night, and the Music"" on the radio, and I called the station to find out who was singing. This is one of the TOP THREE albums I own. Ryan is absolutely par with Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan, and Ella. Ryan's voice is pure silk: smooth, great diction, sensitive and lush phrasing, controlled, full-bodied--ABSOLUTELY STUNNING!!! Please don't miss the opportunity to enojoy this music. The band is stellar; the arrangments are phenomonal, and arrangements can ruin otherwise great songs--these arrangements elevate these songs to a new level. The dynamics are thrilling! Every song on this disc is a treasure. This album is definitely a Grammy winner--no doubt!!!"
3,"Good, Not Great","Having heard Jackie Ryan on jazz radio, I had higher expectations for her CD. She is a competent singer, but the quality of the recording is poor. The balance between her voice and the accompaniment seems off, and it sounds as if she is singing inside a barrel. The arrangements are pretty standard stuff--no surprises, minimal excitement. The best cut on the CD is ""The Best is Yet to Come"". Let's hope it is."
5,"""You Are There"" alone worth the price...","I recently heard the song ""You Are There"" on late-night radio (WGBH-FM Boston) and literally stopped what I was doing. Most beautiful thing I've heard in years. I've ordered the new CD from Amazon and can't wait to hear the rest. On the basis of ""You Are There"" alone, the purchase price is well worth it. So grateful to radio...if not for that, I would have missed out on a great singer who SHOULD be a big star!"
2,Not very good.,"I am a history buff. I was disappointed in these. Same old archival footage that you have seen a hundred times before, and not any new insight on the battles. Boring. My advice is don't waste your money. If you know nothing of history, you might find them useful for understanding a history class, but very little here."
3,A guide to the movie - NOT the book,"This is an overlong publicity book for the Lord of the Rings films, full of detailed chatter about the films and their making, and about Tolkien collectibles. As such, it's not bad. As a guide to Tolkien's book, however, it's another matter. The opening chapters on Tolkien and his work are actually pretty well-written and accurate. But even they are loaded with movie photos; and a chapter on the characters mixes facts from the book and films indiscriminately. A geography-ethnography chapter approaches David Day levels of plonky erroneousness. Most offensive is page 102, a list of parts of the book deemed skippable, especially any poetry that might hold up the action. If you want action, see the movie. A guide to the book should be written by someone capable of appreciating it."
3,Rough Guide to Lord off the Rings,"I run Lord of the Rings Location Tours from Queenstown New Zealand,so when I looked at the Movie location information in this book I found it sparse and inaccurate, as if the person who wrote it had never actually visited New Zealand. However the Book is somewhat redeemed by having alot of good information about Tolkien and other aspects of the Films.As it says a 'Rough' Guide to the Lord of the Rings."
3,Review of Erin Brockovich,"Even though this movie was new and in its original package, due to the age of the movie itself there were some scratches in the sound. I guess it goes to show that you always take a chance when you purchase an older movie."
2,Dull and predictable,"Judging from box office sales, I am one of the few that disliked this film. However, I found it boring and predictable and far too long. While a noble tale, I felt as far as entertainment goes, it was lacking. Roberts was her usual loud, obnoxious self, even though I found her acting better than usual. This film could have been engaging if it weren't for so many needless scenes which shamelessly detailed and emphasized Brockovich's struggles to maintain the family, the bills, the boyfriend, and the job (why did we need to watch her over and over again rooting thru the files at the water plant?). I was very disappointed in this film."
5,Great film,"My daughter bought me this DVD for Christmas. I am not a huge movie buff, but I had heard a little about the film, but it had never appealed to me enough to want to go and see it when it was out in theatres. Anyway, I sat down and watched it just after the holidays when things had calmed down a bit, and I was very impressed, especially with the fact that it was based on a true story, although how much Hollywood had altered it, I'm not sure. Anyway, once I had gotten over the way Julia swore and dressed, I really enjoyed it, even though the end was kind of predictable. But even so it is still very riveting. Erin Brokovich is a great role model (minus the language) for young women, and shows that you can accomplish many things if you have the mind and the motivation to do so."
3,Erin Brockovich - The movie,"This movie has a very interesting and somewhat terrifing tale, and is said to be true!Basically, its about a water company poisoning people for years and not caring about it.Julia Roberts was very pretty in this movie, however, she does drop the ""F- bomb"" ALOT!I doubt if the lady in real life acted as bitchy, but who knows?A good story, an eye opener for those who blindly trust companies."
2,Erin Brockovich,"This movie turned out to be uncompatible with my equipment. Tried passing it on to my friend who tends to own more variety but no luck for her either, gave it to charity and re-purchased another. Not the fault of seller."
5,Loved it!,"I loved Julia Roberts in this role! it was refreshing to see her play a different type of charachter, in this case based on a real life person! This is such a heart felt, touching story because of the work that Erin and Ed did to make such a difference to so many people. Things like this happen all the time, unfortunately, and all too often there is no one to help them. This is the story of how you really can make a difference, not saying it is easy, but it is possible! It also portrays life on the inside for this single mother and is honest in the hardships which are sometimes faced in our lives. Very good movie- one to watch again & again- don't delay, buy it today!"
3,Okay movie,This is a good movie. it shows how far a single mother is willing to work to provide for her family.Amazon Unbox was easy to use and watch. I would tell anyone to just rent the videos. The reason for this is Amazon is uing 2 channel audio and standard deff.
4,Julia Roberts CAN act!,"OK....I've always found Julia Roberts pleasant, but figured her acting range was probably somewhere in the same force as a Daisy Air Rifle (I DID see Mary Reilly, after all!). I was amazed. She fleshed out a seriously flawed character and gives her warmth, charm, and grit.My one flaw with the movie is Erin's full-force bravado that comes with little reproach. She manages to fire off some SERIOUSLY mean things, but yet is never really heald accountable for them. Hard to suspend my disbelief when most real life situations calling for this would probably get you belted.Overall, a seriously well acted film that horrifically depicts the corrupting power of a large corporation and it's ripple effect on a community and on lives. But it also shows how much power one person really can have."
4,A Woman On A mission,Thiis was a good movie with solid performances.I'm not a big Julia Roberts fan butshe did a great job. The story and pacing were great. Some of the facts were embellished (but that's Hollywood!
3,Too much swearing,Erin has a filthy mouth and an abrasive attitude and both became wearing as the movie went on. Except for that it was a great movie.
5,Awesome Material,Bought this special edition and it is an excellent material. It contains a blue-ray DVD + DVD + access to a digital copy! Delivered in the estimated date.
3,Very Entertaining! Julia Shines,"ERIN BROCKOVICH * * * Julia Roberts proves once again that she's worth every penny of her out of sight salary. Her charisma and rapport with costar Albert Finney lift a familiar and mostly routine storyline into great entertainment. Those outfits dont hurt, either."
4,Not what I thought.,"This DVD would not play in my machine. I did not know it was HD, my fault because I did not read it.Shipped fast great service."
4,SODERBERGH TRIUMPHS,"Unfortunately for this film, the ads that came out to promote it told too much of the story and gave away a lot of its really outstanding humour. This film actually was great. Soderbergh's direction was excellent and perhaps unexpected. Julia Roberts turns in a powerhouse performance as Erin Brockovich who uses her quick wit, perseverance and aggression to fuel her drive not only to wheedle her way into a job for which she is not at once qualified but uses it even more convincingly when she investigates the case for which she is well known and around which this script is built. A compelling story of a regular person who uses what skills and assets she does have to discover a cover-up and to get compensation for those whose lives were adversely affected or altogether destroyed by the information covered up. The cast was great, and Roberts deserves accolades for this performance. It was great to see the chameleonic Aaron Eckhart here also as Brockovich's boyfriend."
4,excellent work from a gorgeous star,"I had seen many of the movies of Julia Roberts but this has really topped my list of must have it. I have never seen Julia in such down to earth, beautiful and no mess around attitude like acting before. ""My Best Friends Wedding"" was sweet but this movie will remain in people's heart and mind for a long time. She has put all her looks aside and created a masterpiece of the chracter. I think the real Erin Brokovich will be over the tops seeing this autobiography played all over the world. Hope it nominates for an Oscar."
3,Tedious,"If you watch this film more than once, you find yourself sitting back, and letting it wash over you. This isn't one of my favourite Julia Roberts movies, but it's an OK one. OK, sure, some people talk about her big mouth, and she works it out quite a bit. But we have to give a big hand to Wonderbra - they worked wonders on Julia!This film gets bogged down by a lot of jargon about the world that Julia's character works in. Not enough attention is paid to her attention of her kids, or their father(s). Some will say the highligh of the movie is Julia prancing around in a low cut top, belts, and sky scraping heels. True. But put that aside and you've got a potentially good movie on your hands. It could have been cut, and been much more interesting. I wouldn't have given Julia an Oscar for it though."
1,Worst movie I saw last year,Awful. Go and see Dancer in the Dark if you have to choose among movies nomited for Oscars.
2,Save you money,"Sorry to go against popular opinion here, but this movie was a big disappointment. Sure Juila Roberts does a nice job in the lead role, but the plot is terminally predictable. There are too many scenes to count in which: a) seemingly terrible setback occurs... b) Erin pleads with her boss to take her side... c) he disagrees... d) he finally gives in... e) Erin was right!This movie was also too long, with again, too many scenes to count of teary-eyed victims telling their story just to get the audience rooting for Erin.I have walked out of very few movies in my life, this was one of them."
1,Waiste of money,I know that the movie would have been good. But it was impossible to view this movie. Whatever version HD DVD is it won't play either on my brand new Panasonic Blu Ray player or my DVD player.
5,How To Use Your Body Language To Win Friends And Influence People!!!!!,Julia plays a struggling mother trying to make ends meet and then she gets a job and takes on a Giant Corporation in a Court Of Law.Julia manages to extract a lot of information fom people mainly through her mammary glands and the benefits of a Wonderbra but that is just about all that this movie has going for it. I give this film 5 stars because Julia does look pretty attractive in it at most times.
1,Huh?,"What is this supposed to be about? I mean, Julia Roberts said that she performed (well, you know what she said) for all those people. So, did she? I watched this thing 3 times and I never saw it.This is a bad movie. Don't bother."
3,Left me cold,"Going against the grain here, I will have to say that this story wasn't as good as what it could have been. And that's a pity, because it had all the potential in the world to be much better, especially since it was based upon a true story about mismanagement, corporate lies and conspiracy which ruined the health of thousands of people. Although Roberts is excellent as the foulmouthed but compassionate Erin Brockovich and Finney is great as her jaded boss, there's no doubt who the real stars of this movie are - Julia Roberts' breasts!"
5,Julia Roberts is Erin Brockovich!,"This is an Oscar worthy performance by Julia Roberts. She portrays Erin Brockovich...a lady who has no money to spare. This film was done so well and I give so much credit to Julia Roberts because she not only portrays Erin, but she acts like she is the real life Erin Brockovich. Sometimes actors play real serious in films, and Julia is one of those people. Sit down relax...and enjoy this story because you will love every minute of it! 5 stars all the way!"
2,Hype machine turned in the green.,"The Hollywood push for Roberts as best actress seemed to come when word leaked out that Ms.Roberts swore with gusto during this picture. Yes, that she did, albiet poorly. I am a Julia Roberts fan, However if you want to see her shine buy Notting Hill, if you want dramatics see ""Sleeping with the Enemy"". This movie offers nothing more than a few profanity laced diatribes, Roberts in clothes that are so tight you almost wonder if the director is poking fun at the real woman being portrayed. She has no chemistry whatever with her biker boyfriend, her best chemical reactions are with Mr.Finney, a man several decades her senior. That chemistry is what offers a thread of saving grace, as Mr.Finney and Ms.Roberts are wonderful together. Rent this if you need to see if the hype is right, but spend your DVD dollars on a movie you know you will enjoy."
1,You May Not Like It..or than again.. You May!,"Looking at the main character in the movie...without reference to the plot..what can we say? A foul mouthed,combative litigious women becomes a heroine. Having been caught up in this perception the movie was disappointing at best"
3,Julia truly shines as ERIN BROCKOVICH!,"I saw this film with my ex-boyfriend. He didn't like it very much, but I thought it was WONDERFUL. In my opinion, Erin (Julia Roberts) acted a LITTLE obscene, offensive, and vulgar at times, but I thought she was a very sweet and caring woman. George (Aaron Eckhart) was a funny guy at times, too. I especially liked Ed (Albert Finney). The reason I liked him is because he was so strict and business-like. The one person I couldn't stand was Theresa Dallavale (Veanne Cox). This was because I thought she was SUCH A SNOB! In conclusion, Julia truly shines as ERIN BROCKOVICH!"
3,Familiar story but it's so easy on the eyes!,"It's ""A Civil Action"" but instead of John Travolta, we get Julia Roberts wearing tight, slinky, cantilevered outfits. I must admit I really enjoyed watching Roberts but besides her wardrobe, there is really nothing in this movie that I haven't seen before. It is well done considering that the film had to conform to both the genre and the facts of the true story it was based upon. Soderbergh also comes through with some nice scenes, particularly the opening sequence that sets up the movie."
2,umm...,"Erin Brockovich was not one of Julia Roberts best movies. She does better in emotional and more romantic movies. She did her best job, in my opinion, in the movie Pretty Woman."
4,Who to Believe? What to Believe?,"As is so often the case with a film based on a real person, this film continues to be at the center of controversy. I have no idea how ""true"" its screenplay is and now comment on the film itself. First off, I think Roberts's acting is solid but hardly worthy of the lavish praise it has received. True, it's hard not to notice her but she is hardly in the same league with Field and Streep who portrayed similar characters. Albeit less photgenic and certainly less energetic, Albert Finney (as Ed Masry) does much the better job. Given the tragic and potentially tragic circumstances presented in the film, I expected them to be the primary source of tension rather than whether or not Erin will get a job, win the lawsuit after the automobile accident, etc. As is, the film's priorities seem to suggest that Erin's sense of self-worth is more important than a cancer which has killed or will kill less glamorous folk. I enjoyed the movie. I wish I could admire it more."
2,FEEL GOOD FLICK,"I give this movie two stars because I think Albert Finney is one of the great actors of our time and I always enjoy seeing him, and I also like Julia Roberts, and the movie has a crisp pace and some amusing scenes. Other than that, it's lightweight and predictable, sort of a feel-good alternative to SILKWOOD."
2,Have you all lost your minds?,"Nothing against Ms Roberts, even if she does despise a political party that represents the views of half of all Americans. But this film was boring, didactic, pretentious, condescending, long winded, predictable, cartoonish and stereotyped. Name one character, just one, that you haven't seen in another movie. Sheesh. Let Ms Roberts win an Oscar for something good, like Notting Hill."
3,"An original story idea, well-executed","This is something of an oddity. A story based on real life which isn't about high drama. There's no desperate missions to liberate Nazi art treasures or courtroom custody battles over polio-stricken children. However director Soderbergh makes sure every ounce of tension is wrung from this seemingly unromantic plot. I watched this movie having already heard the whole plot on the radio, and it didn't spoil my enjoyment of the piece. Julia Roberts is in one of her best roles, making the rather strident character she plays likeable and identifiable with. Albert Finney provides fine support as the gruff American lawyer, and thoroughly deserved is Best Supporting Actor nomination. The pathos is overdone in some of the scenes featuring ill children, and the romance subplot seems a little unresolved, but - hey, it's based on the truth, and not everything works out well in real life... or maybe it does!"
3,Usual Hollywood Fare,"A femininist variation of an old film cliche- the unlikely hero going to desperate battle against the big evil organization, with usual dilemmas about family and loved ones. Roberts helself did an erlier variant on this in Pelican Brief, albeit in a relatively low key."
1,BAD!!!,"I intially had high hopes for this movie even though i hate Julie Roberts. The movie starts off nicely for the first 25 minutes as it establishes its trash talking heroine. Then it goes way down hill into boredom. The direction is great of course but that cant always save a bad movie with a bad actress. The fact that she won an Oscar has almost destroyed my faith in the academy. Any other of the nominees did better then she did. I cant believe Sodeberg actually wanted to do this movie. I think he did it just to have a hit so he can do more independent projects. BUt i forgive him for this as he earlier did ""The Limey"" and redeemed himself by doing Traffic in the fall of that year. Julia should stick to Romantic Comedies."
4,Great Movie,Julia Roberts does a knock out performance in this movie as real life Erin Brokovich. She looks and acts stunning and this is a definate feel good movie. Check it out!
3,"witty lines, but lacking depth","If you've been fascinated with movies like The Firm involving legal dramas, Erin Brockovich will be amusing at best. It's worth it for Julia Roberts and some witty punchlines, but it left me wanting to know more about the other characters and their futures. It was a pity that all the characters seemed to be rather thin and not too bright, but the plot could have been probable even if they had been made a little smarter."
2,The Value of an Academy Award...Sell Now!,"I didn't have much of an opinion after watching this movie. It followed a cookie cutter formula of good v. bad and of good going through tough times but triumphing....that is until Roberts got the Academy Award.I've developed an unsophisticated,unscientific and frankly childish opinion: This movie ... Again, I am rating this against the background of extradinorary elite recipients of oscars. Giving Roberts a best actress award is akin to a booger on your Picasso.Perhaps its just been a long winter here, and I'm in a mean mood. To be a bit fair, this flick will do as a snowy/rainy day afternoon."
5,Julia and Julia - the saddest movie of all time?,"This movie is truly the saddest story I have ever encountered in a movie! Julia (Kathleen Turner) is widowed on the day of her wedding to Paolo (Gabriel Byrne) and doesn't ever seem to recover. Several years later, in supernatural circumstances she finds herself flitting between two versions of her life. In one she is married to Paolo with a child, and having an affair with a mysterious photographer (Sting), in the other life she is the widow of many years who meets this same man(Sting again). She is emotionally torn and utterly confused, and events lead to the inevitable heart rending conclusion! This is a must see!"
4,Schneider-Dickey's Reinforced Masonry Design,"This book is the bible of reinforced masonry design. It has a fantastic amount of information useful for architects and engineers. I was somewhat disappointed to find that the book for sale here is actually a reproduction of the original, and is a paperback."
4,Good Value,"The book although an older edition, was a steal. Got it at less than $10 including shipping. Shipping was a bit slow. But I didn't care. I just wanted this book for my library."
2,Too big for me!,"These are nice amethyst earrings, nice purple color. However I'm returning them because they're too big for my ears. The basket setting makes them stick out too much. The setting is not very pretty. The gems are set very low into the basket."
3,"Good Quality, But too small","The earring were really pretty, well made, and nicely packaged, and they came quite quickly. I will be returning them, however because they are too tiny to even see on your ears. Perhaps they would work for someone with multiple earrings or a baby."
5,Perfect for a little girl,"I bought these earrings for my 4 year old niece. They are small for an adult, but perfect for a little girl."
2,They changed the collar,Jockey changed the shape of their crew neck T. Now it isn't as good. Before the collar didn't stick out the back of sweaters as much as it does now. Booooo.
4,As you'd expect,"These are 100% cotton. I also once bought 90% cotton 10% spandex and I like the feel of those better, but I can't find them anywhere anymore."
2,Jockey Tagless Crew Neck T-shirt,"I usually like Jockey crew neck t-shirts for the fit, especially around the neck and these t-shirts fit great right out of the bag. However, after the first washing, the t-shirts shrank so that they are now too tight. We always wash clothes in cold water so it must have been the dryer that shrunk the shirts, which has not been a problem in the past. So I can only surmise that the quality of the shirt has changed. In the future I will be trying another brand of t-shirt."
2,Size issues,"I'm a pretty big, thick guy. I'm about six foot two and weigh 250. I can fit in this tshirt once then, one wash and it is too small. Its frustrating...the 2XL is simply an XL, it seems. Good material, nice tshirt but, like almost every other tshirt, the size issue stinks."
1,Poor quality,"Cheap fabric: very thin and probably wouldn't last long. Also the print is very muted/faded and looks nothing like the picture. I looked at other reviews prior to my purchase and decided to get this product. Some of the reviews said that the quality was good in consideration of the low price but that is a joke. After I returned this product I got a set from Target for less and it is much better quality. Do not get this product - you'll be dissapointed. I don't have crazy high standards either and I rarely leave such critical feedback, but in this case, it totally calls for it."
2,Cheap,"I bought this when I was pregnant with my daughter, who is now 8 months old. It's really cheap fabric. Is not soft at all. Bumper won't fit the crib right, and falls over, the ties easily tore off as well. I am extremely disappointed in this product."
1,Do not waste your time,"Do not let the picture fool you. This was the worst quality bedding I have ever seen! As for the ""soft muted tones"" forget it. It looks like someone played color outside the lines and the pinks are not pink they are florescent. One look even through the package and you can see how cheap the material is. There is nothing soft about it. The bumper would be completely useless if you are looking for it to stay up. I would not let me worst enemy let alone my child sleep on this. It is amazing what they can do with photography these days. And as far as the return policy forget that to. This company expects you to foot the bill to return it and they really do not care that they are selling low rate bedding."
4,Breese is an excellent singer and a wonderful performer.,The CD combines live performances from a concert tour with studio recordings from his first album. Breese has a terrific voice and clearly a marvelous actor.
4,Great Manual,The manual validated a critical repair process for me. The detailed diassembly process was very clear and accurate. I was able to build a special tool to accomplish the sensative disassembly process associated with the problem I had thanks to the detailed explanation of the parts involved. Well worth the investment.
4,Clymer Motorcycle Repair Manual,The manual is very well laid out. If you have a mechanical understanding of ATVs it will help repair your ATV.
4,Ella does it like no one else can!,"Ella Fitzgerald is impressive in her ways of creating a festive and warm audio setting for the holidays. Starting the disc off with ""O Holy Night"" was a perfect beginning to the light jazz voyage through Christmas with the Diva herself.She glides through the more traditional songs almost precisely. Only drifting off the melody path to engrage her individuality in the songs, therefore making them hers.Along with the previously mentioned song, you can find traditionals such as; Away in a Manger, Joy to the World, and many others. I would definitely recommend this for anyone trying to create a family sentiment at Christmas time. Any true Ella fan can appreciate the subtlety here, and it may be a door for opening by those who aren't familiar."
4,This is a page-turner.,Margaret's Peace is a compelling tale of both suspense and the inner journey of a woman to find the meaning of love in her life and the faith to sustain that love. It is truly a page-turner and I highly recommend it to you.
4,Hansen (HAN5100) SAE Wrench Rack Holds 13 Pieces,This wrench rack is well designed and holds all of the wrenchs with a good firm grip. Easy to remove and replace the wrenches. Good design.
1,Doesn't hold my Craftsman wrench well at all.,"The wrenches do not fit tight enough to carry them around easily. Also, one of the tabs broke of immediately - the plastic construction is not very durable. I bought 3 of these, would like to return 2, but it's not worth the return shipping. The Harbor Freight metal ones work much better [...]."
3,Odd. Not the usual sounds from Mr. Empire,"I'm a huge Alec Empire fan, but this album is my least favorite. Still, one reason I like the guy so much is his diversity, so I'll give him credit for this recording. It's all done with a keyboard, no beats anywhere. Somewhat unsettling. Give it a try if you're a completist or you like scary organ music."
3,TITLE OF MOVIE REQUIRED,UNLESS I KNOW THE TITLE OF THE MOVIE- THE GREAT AMERICAN WESTERN-VOL 18- Starring Glenn Ford- How can I review it.?? In fact your entire series of The Great Ameriacan Westerns do not disclose the Titles of the movies without which it is difficult to make a decision re: purchase. Please make necessary adjustments to rectify this flawed information.Thnx/rgdsAshoke P. Mahtani
1,Amazonian arrogance,"First reviewer is dead on. Another astounding example of Amazon's contempt for their customers. They ask you to review and purchase materials they do not condescend to describe. Check any category of entertainment that interests you for more flagrant examples of Amazonian contempt,"
1,Great American Western V.18. The,"I agree with the first 2 reviewers. It's nothing more frustrating that to look for what you want in a series movies and not see the title(s). I tend not to purchase because I don't want to get movies I've never heard of in a package like this. Been there, done it and all I can say is buyer beware. Cannot rate because I have not reviewed so I put a one in, in order to send theis review."
5,Good Christian Fiction,"I hadn't heard of Deborah Raney before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Long story short: I'll be looking to read more of Raney's books, because this one was GOOD.I like how this is a Christian book, but it's not preachy. The references to God and the praying in the book felt natural - they fit with when I'd find such things in my own life. I like the natural Christianity in the book, rather the the oftentimes overly preachy references in other Christian fiction.The plot was good. It showed that the consequences of not listening to that still small voice often are quite painful - not just for those refusing to submit, but also for their loved-ones. The choices we make in our walk with God aren't just about us - they affect everyone we know to some degree or another. Those most dear to us likely are most affected by it. This book served as a good reminder for me to make sure to be in tune to God's prompting in my heart, and to strive to be in His will."
1,Unrealistic and bland,"I found the writing poor and the believabilty of the story REALLY shaky.No matter how strong you are in the Lord (and Daria wasn't. She was totally dependent on her husband) you will have a grieving period ... a wrenching grieving period. To be laughing and and joking with school chums at your husband's funeral is offensive and stupid and unrealistic.Ask Elisabeth Elliot who could hardly get herself out of bed in the morning weeks after her husband died in the jungle.I also found Daria's marriage to Cole nauseating. The guy was a neurotic and a little scary.I think Ms. Raney can do better but ""don't ya know"" ya gotta keep cranking them out when you have a deadline. That's the flavor of this book.I was expecting so much more. For the most part - I hated it."
5,A Journey of Love,"Imagine hearing that the love of your life has been killed....then years later that he is alive!!!!!!! This dilemma takes the reader through all the emotions possible, and then some. The background in underdeveloped Colombia is awesome, but the story grabs your heart and just won't let go. This is a MUST READ for any Christian romance/adventure reader. Months later, my heart is still torn by this book, I think you will love it as much as I do. I'm looking forward to the sequel!!!!"
4,Not What It Appears,BENEATH A SOUTHERN SKY By Deborah RaneyA story of a women torn between two loves--the one she thought dead is found very much alive. Is there a way to untangle the mess she finds herself in without destroying the two men she so dearly loves?Raney tackles a difficult subject and handles it in a way that leaves the reader satisfied. ....
2,Not for me,"I received this book for the value fiction blog tour from Waterbrook Multnomah Publishers. The premise of this book sounded very interesting. It seemed like a story that I had never heard before, and that the journey would keep me reading. Unfortunately, this book just wasn't for me. I did my best, gave it my 100 page try, but I couldn't make it through this book.The writing is very, very detailed. We read almost every thought and feeling the characters have, and everything they're doing at any given moment. I know there are a lot of readers that enjoy this type of writing, but I have a hard time getting into stories like this.It may be that I just wasn't in the mood for this one at this time. I have a feeling that regular readers of Christian romance would love this book."
3,"Nice remixes, but when are we going to get the ORIGINAL remixes on CD?!","As a CC fan, this a nice addition to your CC CD collection, including FIVE new remixes for 2005, including an edgy nu-electro take on MISS ME BLIND that deserves to a club hit all over again courtesy of a F*ck Me I'm Famous remix by France's own David Guetta - the other remixes, although oddly all clocking in around 3:30 minutes (why?), are cool updates, like the LEDGE remix of KARMA, but...I must ask, with the 80s being cashed in & exhumed like a rotting corpse once again, WHY can't Virgin cough up a real 12"" CD collection featuring ALL the original CC/Boy George 12""s - I'm talking the 10 minute remix of SEXUALITY, the dance remix of GHUSTO BLUSTO, BOY's B-sides and remixes from SOLD and more - c'mon guys, CC still has a wide fanbase around the globe, this CD would sell if you create it!"
3,A mixed drag of a bag,"The only thing new is the five remixes. The rest you may already have. With Boy George's latest legal lament and Jon Moss in a new band, Culture Club are DOA again, so Virgin/EMI France found a way to fill the void (instead of another greatest hits collection with the same recycled material, you know the one). Boy may have approved the remixes, since it's akin to his DJ work. The remix of ""Do You Really"" is more in line with the Carribean aura. ""Karma Chameleon"" makes sense as well. The other three just aren't the same."
5,Great sounding exhaust,"Love the exhaust, no exhaust drone , just as quiet as stock until higher rpm then a nice sound, and my milage increased."
4,BOOGIE MEN,I WOULD HAVE RATED THIS A 5 IF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE LONGER. IF YOU ARE A FOGHAT FAN YOU WILL LOVE THIS DVD. IT BRINGS BACK SO MANY MEMORIES FROM THE 70'S ROD PRICEIS SUPERB ON THE SLIDE GUITAR. LONESOME DAVE IS GREAT ON VOCALS FOGHAT NEVER MISSED A BEAT. I WISH THERE WAS MORE LIKE IT. IT IS A GREAT DVD.
5,I Was There When It Happened!,"Richard is correct. It was recorded entirely in Dayton in 97 at the Ribfest in the parking lot of the EJ Nutter Center at Wright State. It was a great show and this DVD caputes that night very well! One of the cameramen almost ran me over but I ducked and just kept on boogying, right up front! It was a hot July night but Dave and Company were hotter! The 5.1 is excellent so crank it up! A band near and dear to this 50 year old dude's heart."
5,Kicks @SS concert!,"I just recieved my Foghat DVD today and it totally kiss @ss! I have seen them in the early 80's live and they put on a great show. They still ROCK in this DVD! This concert is excellent a ""MUST HAVE"" to your collection. ""lonesome Dave"" you will be missed."
3,songs songs songs,"When you buy a fog hat dvd you want the songs that made them stars. sure you have slow ride, And fool for the city, but thats it on the truly good old fog hat usuals, if you just want a it too say you own it then fine. But probably skip it."
2,WASNT THAT GREAT WAS IT?,"I bought this much anticipated dvd from one of my favorite party hard rock bands of my era, the 70's. Yes I know the history and know all about Savoy Brown etc. I had Energized, Rock and ROll Outlaws, Night Shift, Fool for The City, Live, Boogie Motel and loved all the radio hits. BUT, this cd was just so so. It was dark, too dark, the 1 or 2 cameras were far away, and whats up with that huge fat guitarist? Jeeez, I have a problem with that too. I need to have a great light show for a live concert. I really didnt hear any ""Jams,"" it was just the songs but with a live crowd. Why didnt they work the crowd? It seemed like they were tired and just wanted to finish the set. I was extremely upset because I know it could have been better. Well, at least the Joe Satriani Live from San Fran was %100 pure 'My Style.' Sorry Foghat but this dvd could have been better. (And I hope that huge guy loses some weight, he looks bad.)"
4,Amazing look into the past,"John Digweed has been playing electronic music for years. Over time, he's weathered the changes that have come about for electronic music. This collection is a small taste of what he considers his favorites. These aren't just tracks he's played, but tracks that have influenced him and his style over his long career. To call this album trash, or say it's not worth the money is not only ignorant, it's flat out wrong. This album is worth every penny for those that truly care about electronic music.The variety of stlyes and sounds on this album is great. Everything from recent songs he's played to a few songs from the early 1980's. Although this album is basically a compilation of songs and not a mix, he does make an attempt at mixing a few transitions. The result isn't what you would normally expect from someone as well known as he is for flawlessly mixing tracks, but it's understandable given the songs he's selected.If you're a true EDM fan, this album is a must have."
2,NO,"This review is intended for those who prefer theirhouse/tribal/trance music to be vocal-free.What makes many of Digweed's CD's fantastic are thesignificant number of dark tracks which are vocal-free,especially on the Global Underground CD's ""Hong Kong"" and""Los Angeles.""So if you're considering buying this ""Choice"" package, youhave to ask yourself: Are there enough vocal-free tracksto justify buying this?The answer is a resounding NO. NO. NO. And again: NO."
4,Better than I expected.,"I was pleasantly surprised by this series. I have seen different versions of Pride and Prejudice and I have liked all of them for different reasons.When I say that it is better than I expected it's because I have become eskeptical over things that are praised too much. I tend to not like them as much as reviewers or critics or even friends rave over them. This however is in my opinion, very good.I recomend it to everyone who likes the book,works by Jane Austen , other versions of Pride and Prejudice and of course who likes Colin Firth (pretty good performance)."
5,True Joy,"Love, love, love this movie. It is long, yes, but well worth watching if you have any faint adoration of Jane Austen."
5,*The Best Pride and Prejudice!*,"This is a wonderful gift for anyone who loves Pride and Prejudice.I enjoyed every moment watching it.I loved all the actors,I think they all did perfect in their roles.I must say my favorites were Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth.A true romance movie.Will enjoy many viewings of this."
2,disappointment,"Everything that can be said about this superb story, production, acting, etc. has been said. I was so disappointed, however, when I saw that the color in the DVD was really dreadful. Colin Firth had snow white skin, and pitch black hair and eyes, and poor Jennifer Ehle looked like a witch. I had just about worn out my video when I bought the DVD - I guess I'll have to buy the video again."
5,Pride and Prejudice - Colin Firth version,"In perfect new condition, good price, good shipping time! As a Pride and Prejudice addict I was already familiar with this miniseries! This has become my current favorite version - I have been told to watch the Lawrence Olivier version ... next purchase."
5,Great Mini Series!!!,"I have read the book and seen this mini series adaptation. I am usually pretty critical about movies that are made of books but this version of Pride and Prejudice was done well. I highly recommend it. Colin Firth is the best Mr. Darcy, I really couldn't see any other actor playing him. The actress who plays Mrs. Bennet was excellent as well."
4,a great version,I purchased this movie for my wife's birthday and she completely enjoyed it. She asked for this version over the newest one.
4,Colin Firth is wonderful,Great mini series that stays true to the book. It is wonderfully portrayed and Colin Firth is just wonderful as Mr Darcy.
5,None better!,"It is inconceivable to me and my wife that there could ever be a better screen adaptation of Austen's masterpiece. Certainly there hasn't been one until now. Mrs. Bennett is a little over-the-top, but all of the other characterizations are superb. We have watched this repeatedly with only a month or two between viewings, and it holds up exceedingly well. Like all great works, each time you watch, you see something you missed before. We don't have the self-control to watch it one episode a week, as it was produced. We typically start about 2:00 or 3:00 in the afternoon, watch the first three episodes, break for dinner, and then watch the rest. (Sometimes we even eat while watching the second half!) If you love Austen, this certainly will not disappoint you."
2,"New ""Special Edition"" DVD is not much better","The new widescreen DVD version is not a whole lot better than the original pan and scan DVD. The colour is still washed out (probably even more so than the original DVD). To make matters worse, this new edition has FAR too much contrast. The highlights are blown out, and the subtle shadow areas are all solid black. There's also FAR too much edge enhancement.The only advantages to this new DVD edition are the use of anamorphic widescreen, the addition of a brief ""making of"" featurette, and a few text biographies.Be forewarned: you might want to hang on to the original DVD version. This new one is not an improvement, and in many ways, is even worse."
5,PRIDE AND PREJUDICE,"A must for lovers of Jane Austen. My mother borrows my copy so often, I bought her a copy!"
5,Nobody does it like the BBC,Absolutely outstanding. I can't see Colin Firth in any other role after this. It's beautifully done in every way and all the actors are perfect. I've watched it again and again. It's definitely a chick flick but then it is Jane Austin. The outdoor scenes are so amazing. Only in England can you find this amazing historical architecture and scenery seemingly untouched.
2,"Badly done, over acted and longer isn't better","This production was truly not worthy of the BBC, the whole story was obviously dumbed down for the consumption of the masses, because you know they won't take it straight, but isn't that the whole idea. People cannot truly grow when given sugary sweet versions like this, People need meat, something to chew upon and perhaps get stuck in their teeth. Even the lean Hollywood version was meatier, this version was just long and stupid."
3,Colin Firth Almost Ruins It,"This miniseries stays very close to the plot of the famous Jane Austen novel without ever managing to really catch its spirit. The book is much funnier and livelier than this version leads you to believe.The sets and costumes are very nice and very well photographed, and most of the cast is very good. Colin Firth is an exception. He is nothing like Mr. Darcy in the book and he can't act his way out of a paper bag. I have to deduct two stars due to his performance alone."
3,Disappointed in this version of P & P,"I had not watched this when it was originally on A&E; but have heard how great it was so decided to purchase it. I expected it to be much better than it was. Due to the length it had more of the book in it but seemed to drag and at times be down right boring. I made the mistake of reading the enclosure with the actors/actresses comments as the comments of the lead actress made me dislike her. I don't remember ever seeing her in anything else and her complaining about how difficult the role was and how long it took to film probably affected by opinion. In a period piece like this I would also prefer the actors project a more masculine image since they have to wear such frilly clothingI would say it is an average mini-series, nothing special about it. It was something nice to watch I had not previously seen during the writers strike."
1,Heaving Bosoms,"Worst production of Pride and Prejudice ever. The screenplay was obviously written by a man, and one who did not comprehend the source material. Sexed up for American TV, it loses all the charm of the manners and morals play of the novel. Almost a pastiche, all the characters are caricatures. Eahles face pulling and continuous eyebrow raising are a distraction from the story as well as her overblown sighing and bosom heaving. Don't bother with this version of the movie. Reread the novel or go for the '70s version with Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul."
1,Actors all wrong,"Jennifer Ehle is too fat. I am a fat woman, so I'm not dissing fat women. She doesn't have the sparkle that Lizzie exudes in the novel.Colin Firth would be better playing a pugilist. He has no class at all.Entire film was a disappointment."
1,Serious artistic and technical flaws,"I am hard of hearing and the lack of captioning makes some of the dialogue difficult to follow and there are language issues. People these days walk on eggshells to avoid offending blacks and gays and Jews and femminists who will have a tempoer tantrum over even accidental offenses against them, but they think nothing of offending God by misusing his name. The use of Blasphemy in this movie is anachronistic, and even if the people making this movie don't believe in God, they don't seem to care that they are offending the people who do believe in God with that kind of language. I bought it because 19th century life was clean, and I am deeply dissapointed because it is another example of what i call ""Cafeteria Bigotry,"" whereby one preaches tolerance and respect for other's opinion, while in actuality they are hypocritically selecting which groups they mind offending, and which groups they don't mind offending."
5,Pride and Prejudice,"This was the best movie I have ever saw. I love the romance and the costumes. After I read the book, I saw the movie on T.V. When i found out that I was going to miss the very end, I went out and bought it. I have watch this movie over and over again. I never grow tired of this movie. I recommend getting this movie if you like historical romances."
3,"Great story, bad DVD","This is such a watchable mini-series. I'm giving 3 stars because my copy of this DVD ... is full screen TV format, eventhough the box says widescreen; and because the image quality is pretty dismal. This is the only DVD I own that really forced me to fine-tune my TV's contrast, color, and brightness colors to get an acceptable picture (I've tried 2 TVs and 2 DVD players). In particular, watch the contrast. Overall, I'm thinking I might've done better by buying the VHS version!"
4,"Good Movie, mediocre way it was put together","This is a fantastic movie and its very helpful to have it on dvd BUT it is still in the same form as it is on vhs. What I mean is that the credits are there after every section the same as on the vhs and the same as when it was on tv. That was pretty annoying. and like all dvd's it tends to skip every once and a while. but nothing lasting. its a great movie, well worth the long 6 hour watch.Jenna"
5,I wish I could give it more than 5 stars...,"This is an absolutely wonderful movie. As a movie alone it is beautiful, but it is also a faithful adaptation of one of the greatest novels in literature. The acting is superb, the locations breathtaking, and the trueness to Austen's work is refreshing. After seeing the horrible adaption from the 40's this adaptaion was like a breath of fresh air. Colin Firth is the ideal Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle a great Elizabeth. I can't express how great this movie is."
4,Worth the Blu upgrade,"having watched the regular dvds upscaled on my Toshiba HD player and these new Blu Rays on my Panny HD, Blu Ray is worth the upgrade. With a five being reference quality, I would rate it a 3.5 on picture quality. Sound is clearer as well."
5,The Original,"Nothing beats an original. This is a classic movie that should be in every Jane Austins collection. If you have the newer verison of pride and prejudice with keira knightly and are asking yourself if you should get this, GET IT!!!The characters are charming. No one can play Mr Darcy quite like Colin Firth, such a proud actor in this film. The only one flaw in this movie is that i didnt enjoy Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth, although she is a very good actress. All the sisters where quite charming except for the one who played Lydia Bennett. It could be how the character played in the movie.Just a wonderful wonderful made movie! A joy to watch with a glass of wine and some popcorn"
2,Not for the hard of hearing,"I only watched a bit of this as it turned out NOT to have subtitles which my husband needs. In the few minutes I watched the color looked washed out and not at all like the usual exceptionally colorful Masterpiece Theater version which I previously enjoyed. The Jane Austen story is, of course, excellent."
2,gorgeous!!!!!!!,This is a beautiful presentation of a great series. The book alone was more than worth the money spent.
2,dry and boring...not worth the time...i was misled by pos review,"After reading all the good reviews, I bought this version with great expectation but was left disappointed by the hype. While this version closely chronicles the book, it lacked passion and suspense. The chemistry between Lizzie, Darcy, Jane, and Bingley was rather dull and unbelievable.The casting was off: Jane and Lizzie were too mature...I found Darcy absolutely unapproachable...Mrs. Bennet was odiously played...Mr. Bennet lacked that sarcastic wit and timing. Sigh. I still prefer and love the version with Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFayden despite its adaptation."
4,Best version of P&P,"This is the most faithful movie adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. My only issue with the blu-ray version is that it isn't formatted to fit a tv screen, so there are times when the shot is too wide, and the viewer misses the action on the sides."
5,A Classic Book Becomes a Film Classic,"There have been many versions of Pride and Prejudice over many years. This one is our all-time favorite. The length of the film provides a leisurely study of the mores and customs of Jane Austin's time. It is faithful to the book - verbatim in many cases. All the performances are excellent; there is a depth of talent in the entire cast. The only flaw I've observed, after repeated viewings, is in the direction of Colin Firth's ""Darcy"". He does not appear to be burning with passion as he suggests. The attraction between Elizabeth and Darcy is palpable in the recent version starring Keira Knightly. Her performance compares favorably with that of Jennifer Ehle, whose 'Elizabeth' may never be equaled. The new film is too modern in language and careless with this classic. It is also too short to reflect Austen's times. Buy this treasure!"
2,"To ""DARK"" to the BRIGHT novel","I don't like this TV-Movie. I watched it in 1996 and I don't recommend it the anyone. I am and was and will only in love with the BBC 1980 Edition starring Elizabeth Garvey and David Rintoul. They are the best because they really look like ""Elizabeth & Mr Darcy"". The 1995 Edition produced a dark scene for everyone and only ""Charlotte"" was given the right pick. There is no else perform best than the 1980 Edition. I can't believe people who like the 1995 rather than the 1980s' will have their sense on reading the Jane Austen Best Novel very well. If you read it through and carefully watch the 1980 ""Pride and Prejudices"", you will understanding why I've been in love with this Edition. It's a bit shorter than we expect, but it's also a very great fun of watching!"
3,"This adaptation is fine, but the BBC's is better!","The BBC's adaptation of P&P, featuring David Rintoul and Elizabeth Garvie, is more faithful to the book and features better acting than this A&E adaptation. The BBC probably had a smaller budget, so their sets aren't as lavish, but their version is still visually beautiful. Most importantly, Mr. Darcy is faithfully portrayed by David Rintoul, whereas this A&E version distorts his character to make him more acceptable to contemporary sensibilities. For example, the swimming scene is oddly out of character (and not in the book). If you're only going to buy one version of P&P, it should not be this one."
1,Still the best!,"I just saw the 2005 version of Pride and Prejudice last night and it made me appreciate the 1996 version even more. If you have read the book, perhaps more than once as I have, then you will love this version because this film captures the characters, the rules of society, the style of living, as they were described in the book. There are a few minor liberties but they add to the story. The acting was superb. The characters in the book lived in a very polite, very reserved society and these actors were able to convey so much with a glance, a gesture, a stiffening of the shoulders. I will admit that I was already a fan but never more so than after viewing the new, and dreadful version. If you are going to buy a DVD of Pride and Prejudice this is the one."
3,"Great performances, very poor video quality","The story is fun, the characters are right out of a fairy tale but the extremely poor video quality is a distraction. Someone should buy the BBC and A&E some decent video equipment."
2,The Restored Pride and Prejudice DVD,"[..]I do not know what went wrong, but I am missing the remaing of this movie.Only 2 discs were inside the Cover of this movie. The movie ending with Mr. Darcy leaving to find Lydia ! and that was it ! no more disc was inside the cover. Does this movie come with more than one part ? Like I said, when I received the DVD , something was missing .Surely this was not all of it!!!! Went back to check on Amazon, to make sure that I did not overlook Part 2 , but nothing was there to order. I love this movie, and was very dis-appointed that I did not receive the complete movie. Take my advice and stay with the one starring karen Knightly !"
5,"Pride And Prejudice, Magnificient","A must see, a mixture of love, romance, action and irony. Amazing film.a Romantic, yet twisted plot."
5,Best Pride and Prejudice Ever,The best Pride and Prejudice I have ever seen Jennifer Ehle is excellent as the leading lady and Colin Firth is my Darcy. Amazon is so reliable.
5,If you love Colin Firth...you have to have this one,This is my favorite Pride and Prejudice movie thus far. There are I think 3 versions out there or that I know of. This one is the best by far. Colin Firth...mmmmm:) He actually had a relationship in real life with Jennifer Ehle. Knowing this also made the movie great too since you know that they had chemistry on and off the screen.
5,Pride & Predudice dvd,I lost my orignal copy and was so excited to find a copy and with just a push of a button have it sent to me. Thank youAmazon .com. I plan on shopping the web for all my needs.Dona C. Rogers
5,additive,"There is no other production of this story so authentic and enchanting as this one with these stars. I watch this movie several times a year. It transports me to a time and place I love and the way Colin and Jennifer interact with each other is so believable that you honestly feel the tranformation of their affections. His facial expressions of frustration, pain, pleasure and adoration of being in her company need no dialogue and her responses are equally passionate and honest. Every one of the supporting actors are perfectly cast."
5,"Fabulous, Fabulous, Fabulous","I normally hate remakes but this one had to be made. What can I say that hasn't been said already. Colin Firth is a national treasure. Jennifer Ehle is luminous. The great Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson don't hold a candle to these two. As for the two other British television remakes, ""feh, pooey!"" I doubt this will ever be topped by anyone!"
5,Absolutely delightful,"I read the book in a few short days, staying up until the wee hours one morning to finish it because I was unable to put it down. I immediately went out and purchased the movie to quench my newfound obsession for Jane Austen's amazing story :) The movie is delightful. It was pure joy to see Austen's witty words spoken with all the marvelous acting and period dress and scenery. Colin Firth, now famous as Mr. Darcy, plays the role superbly with subtlety and depth. Jennifer Ehle as the ""headstrong"" Eliza Bennet is also delightful, and it is fun to pour over their scenes together and witness the nuances of emotion. Everyone involved has done justice to Jane Austen's novel - making the movie almost as much fun to treasure as the book!"
5,One of the Greatest Works in Cinematic History!!,"This is probably the greatest movie that I have ever seen! The adaptation of it from the novel is superbly accurate and well done. I watched it when it first aired on A&E and again just recently, and I have to say that its magic still captivates me! It portrays wonderfully the complex interactions between courting males and females that were not only true in Austen's time but in modern times as well. Speaking as a ""chick"", when you get right down to it, every woman longs for a ""Mr. Darcy"" in shining armor (or, should I say shining ""Pemberley""?)!!"
2,Poor production quality mars great film,"What a disappointment to see this DVD after viewing the VHS version. Though presented as an upgraded version from the video, the colors are awful, the contrast is terrible, subtle light colors go to white and anything vaguely dark goes to black--all the beautiful details of the original VHS are lost for some reason. I wrote to A&E asking about it and they did not respond. And it's not isolated to my DVD or TV (I checked). What a sad way to treat an otherwise great piece of film."
5,Colin Firth Is Darcy!,"I don't think any other actor will be capable of convincing me he is Fitzwilliam Darcy after seeing Colin Firth play him in this boxed video set. And Darcy is everything to Pride And Prejudice. All other aspects to the production are also superb but whoever made this understood getting Darcy right was the key to every woman's heart. Laurence Olivier, move over; Firth knocked you off of your Darcy chariot in the much older film version!"
3,Disappointing DVD of a great performance,"First of all, let me say that the 3 stars are not for the performance. I also have the VHS set, which I would give 5 stars.The DVD version looks washed out. If this is really ""remastered,"" they ought to unremaster it. What is surprising is that the colors in the scenes shown in the ""featurette"" appear to be as rich as in the VHS version, but this is not the case in the body of the DVD.I bought the DVD to get to my favorite scenes more easily, but it appears that I will have to keep my VHS edition if I want to see them in good color."
2,Great movie ruined by terrible transfer,"I was so pleased to learn of the re-release of P&P in a widescreen (Special Edition) version. I once owned the laser disc boxed set, and sold that when the full screen version became available on DVD. I have just watched the latest version on DVD and was so disappointed by its transfer, I was prompted to do a scene-for-scene comparison with the earlier DVD release. Opening titles are OK, but after that, the difference is astonishing. Some scenes have a green cast, otherwise the colours are generally washed out, with loss or degradation of flesh tones. There is also a general loss of detail. The aspect ratio appears to be 1.85, not 2.35, as stated on the cover. I hope the studio will do something about this and recall the product ASAP. Such a shame because this version of P&P was an outstanding production, deserving to be collected and frequently enjoyed."
1,Great TV - terrible DVD,"The best adaptation of a Jane Austern book ever - marred by a really terrible DVD image. It is way too dark and very, very green."
1,Digitally Remastered? Really?,"I love this adaptation, but this ""restored edition"" gets 1 star for false advertising. I wish I read the bad reviews before buying.I was excited when I saw this for sale at such a low price and ""digitally remastered"" too, but when I watched it, I hardly noticed any difference from the blurry washed out version of an earlier DVD set.Digitally remastered? I think not.... Don't waste your money on this.NOTE: I am talking about ASIN: B00364K6YW ""restored DVD"" and not the blue-ray version. For some reason, my review is coming up for all the versions..."
2,A dissapointment..,This does not compare with the cassette original. A distortion in the character's features make their faces long. Could be it's only how I perceive It.
5,Excellent BBC Production,The production is excellent. I wish I could say the same for the quality of the DVD. This DVD's video is the poorest of any I have in my collection! The VHS copy that I have access to is actually visually clearer!
5,My All Time Favorite!!,"I absolutely love this version of ""Pride & Prejudice!"" I can't even say how many times I have watched this over & over; all 6 hours worth. If you're a romantic at heart, or love period films, you'll love this."
4,"Wonderful, but flawed","The movie itself is absolutely wonderful. It is one of the rare items that I will dedicate 5+ hours worth of time watching from beginning to end. I could even sit down and watch it twice. However, the DVD quality is not so grand. The miniseries is put together poorly, leaving obvious pauses etc and it doesn't flow easily. Well worth it anyway and won't stop me from dedicating a rainy day to it several more times. Truly well done by all actors and directed beautifully."
5,Incomparable,"A sensational production of Jane Austen's masterpiece. I've used it to convert several men who previously claimed they ""disliked"" Austen. After this tv version was first aired in the US, I became a ""Darceymaniac"", and still love Colin Firth."
4,Love love love this movie!!!!,I rated it a 4 star because they digitally improved the film and it doesn't look as good as the original. But the movie itself is my all time favorite.
4,Austen on the 'Small' screen: You've got to love it!,"I've owned this DVD set for four years, and I have to say that its the gift that keeps on giving. I watch this movie often. Its a great Mother-Daughter bonding tool. This A&E production is the best version of the Jane Austen classic. You'll giggle at the ridiculous Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins. You'll snarl at the high and mightly Bingley sisters. You'll admire and envy Lizzy. You'll love Mr. Darcy. Yes, the color is off...and let's hope a brighter edition becomes available, but for now I'm enjoying what I have. Capital, Capital!"
5,Will most seriously please,"This miniseries was wonderful! Of course I liked the book too, but the movie does an excellent job of following the book. Most movies I see after reading a book are a disappointment. Not this one. All 6 episodes are great and each one leaves you ready to watch the next one and when it's all over watch all 6 again. My sister, her boyfriend, and I were talking with British accents for a week. After watching the BBC miniseries, it makes Bridget Jones' Diary references to Colin Firth and her Roman interview with him in the sequel regarding playing Mr. Darcy even more hilarious. Anyone who has enjoyed Jane Austen novels or even someone who has only read the Bridget Jones books will really enjoy the BBC miniseries ""Pride and Prejudice."""
5,The best version!,"I'm reviewing the dvd version, not the Blu-ray. I must say, this BBC mini-series is the absolute best one I've seen of Pride & Prejudice brought to screen. The actors, script, scenery, flow, etc were perfect. I cannot look at another Mr. Darcy other than Colin Firth. What a magical piece of artwork this film is. Please see this, you will not be disappointed!"
4,*Almost* perfect...,"Having owned the first release of this on DVD, I was thrilled to find this available on Blu-ray. The miniseries itself is amazing, of course, and the special features are thorough and insightful. There are some scenes I shall never look at the same way again!But here's my caveat... and I am not sure if it's a defect with my disc or a more widespread problem... I found that there was ""noise"" in the picture off and on throughout, on both discs, mainly on lighter flesh and fabrics. But suddenly as it appeared, it would go away! And then, towards the very end, when Darcy and Elizabeth are taking their walk, the picture loses resolution for a couple minutes. It's as if they put in a sampling of what they had to work with, pre-restoration. But I have a feeling that's not the case, because it's quite distracting during such an important scene. I may exchange it through Amazon and see if another copy does the same things."
2,Worst looking Blu-ray I own,"This is an excellent production of Pride and Prejudice, and we really enjoyed the DVD version. This Blu-ray edition is a real stinker though, video quality-wise. There's so much buzzing swirling movement in peoples skin and in the sky shots that it's completely distracting, and that's on a 40"" HDTV. Yuck. I sure hope the studio takes the time for a do-over. This release looks absolutely awful, I'd recommend you stick with the DVD version and await a new transfer for high-def."
5,A Wonderful Performance,"It was very intresting and captivating. I really enjoyed it, it wasa great performance by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. One of myfavorite movies."
4,"4 1/2 stars - it was goood, not my favorite version though","I did love this adaptation and I agree with everyone that Firth played an excellent Mr. Darcy - However, it did drag on a bit. There were parts that could have been cut out, as they were in the newer version with Keira Knightley, that were needed in the book obviously, but in my opinion not the movie. Other than that, the chemistry between Lizzie and Darcy was spectacular, as it should be, and it was beautifully filmed and very true to the book. Definitely a must-watch if you love Austen."
1,blu ray buyer beware,"ok , i'm not a fan but my wife is ..she loves all that is jane austin. i'm into goodfella's and the godfathers, etc. we have a "" top of the line "" 52 LCD & blu ray player. i've seen bits of this movie over the years in all forms...... i was excited to be able to get this on blu ray for her as a surprise. she didnt know it was comming out .although it is better than the dvd versions i've seen her watching, this is the worst blu ray movie we have ever seen !!! it is very grainy through out the whole movie compared to so many blu rays we've watched old movies and newer ones. they did a terriable transfer job on this which i'm very surprised as this movie is so popular. if your going to do it, do it right !!! there are times where the scene is crystal clear then as they are walking etc it changes to grainy ( by blu ray standards ). just wanted to let you gals know not to get your hopes up too much. it is possiable for some of you with smaller screens, that you wont notice as much"
3,Not good enough to tempt me again,It's a ok kinda movie. The cast was alittle less than desirable. Colin Firth is no Matthew Macfadyen. Stick with the 2005 movie.
4,"Very good, but not excellent","The acting is good and the story is timeless, but there are a few things that I'd change:Jennifer Ehle, as Elizabeth, always makes this annoying face with her mouth pursed up. Otherwise her acting is great, but this simper-face annoys me.Mr. Collins is given too much screen time. It wears out his welcome. He's funny, but not enough to span the amount of time he has onscreen. Mrs. Bennet, however, is always hysterical.Mr. Bingley's sideburns are awful. Jane is pretty, but not prettier than Elizabeth, and she'd look better without all those annoying curls around her face. This was the style, but they could do it in moderation.Kitty was not given enough personality in comparison to Lydia.But despite that, it was a great movie. I've watched it at least 5 times since I got it two years ago."
2,pride and prejudice,I found this series to be really disappointing except for Colin Firth whom I just love. The girls (actresses) were quite ugly I thought and just the whole series was a huge disappointment on the same level as the new Pride and Prejudice starring Keiren Knightly. The original film with Greer Garson was fabulous and still is today. The actors and actresses were carefully chosen and it will always remain a classic.
2,Unable to run dvd,"I cannot run the DVD Pride and Prejudice-The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996) on mymachine. I cannot control the tracking of the movie as it plays. I wouldappreciate any suggestions."
2,If you reaaally love Jane Austen,"I love Jane Austen, and this film it's ok, but not quite what I expected. Collin Firth's performance is not as good as we are used to nowadays and Jennifer Ehle's doesn't go farther than being smiley through the film. I'm not returning the product, but had I watched it before buying my desicion would be not to buy it"
4,"Excellent movie, appalling transfer","Of course this movie was one of the best I have seen, but the sound and video quality was horrendous. It looks as though they copied it right off a VHS tape. I guess, just because it is a DVD doesn't meean it's a clear picture after all. Be Warned."
5,One of the best ever!!,"This is one of the best Jane Austen movies ever! I quote it all the time, and all my friends do too. We positively roll over with laughter at the facial expressions of Mrs.Bennett, or at the clumsiness of Mr.Collins. Jennifer Ehle is suberb, she makes you believe she is Lizzie, every emotion, every look is Lizzie Bennett all the way. Colin Firth is also incredibly good, every facial movement and tone is Mr.Darcy. I think everyone should watch this at least once in a lifetime. For it is a once in a lifetime movie."
5,Pride and The Prejudice,I think this movie is spectacular. I have seen it once and I am trying to buy it. I have tryed all the movie stores in my area and there isn't this movie which makes me so angry because I love it so much. I can't wait until I get it.
5,Enchanting and Addictive,"One word of warning: if you buy this DVD you will not be able to stop watching it!This is one of my favorite movies ever and the fact that it comes on DVD is a real treat. Since buying this little ditty for myself, I have not been able to stop watching it. The beauty of it is with DVD I can watch my favorites scenes over and over without rewinding...I just click a button and I'm there. This is worth every cent you pay for it if you choose to buy it.For a movie that is five hours long and the fact that there is not one boring or ""slow"" part to it is just amazing. The casting is near perfect and the attention to detail is very pleasing. Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy will mesmerize you and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet will make you smile and laugh. I honestly can't think of anything negitive to say. Jane Austen fans will be thrilled with this (if there is one alive who hasn't seen it yet). What I'm trying to say is BUY THIS NOW...you won't be sorry!"
2,"Wonderful film, terrible print.","I want to echo the comments made in the previous review. I saw this adaptation when it was first broadcast on TV and thought it was superb. I was terribly disappointed by the DVD. The color is dreadful. All of the pale tones have become ""hot"" as if they were on film that was overexposed. It's very distracting and really diminishes the quality of what was an otherwise excellent miniseries. Very sad."
1,Wonderful movie - VERY POOR recording!!!!,I love this movie and watch it all the time. I have a copy of the original recording both on VHS and DVD but it is wearing out so bought this version and can't believe how horribly it is! The colors are completely washed out to the point of there being almost no color at all. What in the world did they do to it?! If you can get your hands on a copy of the original get it instead.
1,Unbelievably Dissapointed - Bad Quality DVD,"I purchased the 10th Aniversary set of P&P for my father for Christmas 2006 as a replacement to his VHS set, as one of the tapes has tracking problems. Imagine my dissapointment when we began to watch the DVD, and the color was almost completely washed out. Nowhere near the rich color of the VHS version. The image looked squished also, and the people were abnormally long and skinny, it was torture to look at. Not only that, but every 5-10 minutes the action would freeze, then jump ahead. I did notice, in the bonus video, that the interviews were normal color, but the segments of the movie shown were still washed out. I have returned the DVD set, and am afraid to purchase one of the other DVD versions for fear that they will have the same problems. I am agonized over this, as I have seen the VHS version with my father dozens of times, and we are both totally dissapointed"
3,awaiting the Extra-special edition as well,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer about the quality of the special edition DVD of Pride and Prejudice. The colors were ""off "" and washed out and the whole movie seemed to have blurry outlines. I too, had to increase the brightness and should have lowered the contrast but was unwilling due to an already blurry picture. I was very dissapointed =( I watch the VHS version all the time when im cleaning downstairs and bought this edition to use on the computer upstairs in the same manner. Very dissapointed. I give the movie 5 stars. I give the DVD edition 3 =("
2,A sad transcription of a great performance,"Like at least one other reviewer I was disheartened to see how poorly this great mini-series was transferred onto DVD format. I, too, have watched my VHS version many times. I had excitedly expected the DVD to be better in both sound and video quality, but, alas, it is sadly worse. I had to fiddle with the brightness and color controls on my TV to even get a passable color rendition. How, how, did this travesty get released? I feel so stung by this experience that I think a ""technical quality"" rating of sound and video should be part of any DVD review, particularly transcriptions from VHS. It makes me leery about buying DVD versions of other old VHS favorites without renting them first or otherwise obtaining a preview of the DVD quality."
1,I had to return it!,"I love this movie - it's one of my all-time favorites. I was so looking forward to owning this as my very first DVD. However, this DVD presentation is very poor. The images are washed out - the actors' faces are white with very little color and the whites of the dresses sometimes merge with the light backgrounds! And the music sounds a bit muted. There is a ""Making Of..."" piece included on the DVD in which they use full-screen video images where the color is normal - faces are pink, not white, and the scenery is rich. The contrast with the movie presentation is astonishing - you really see what your missing! I don't recommend you buy this DVD. I'm going to wait for another version which will hopefully have corrected color."
5,Excellent Adaptation of the Book!,"I absolutely love this movie, and I believe they did a fantastic job of staying true to Jane Austen's characters. As with any book-to-screen rendering, some of the depth of the characters is lost, but thankfully only to a tiny degree in this picture. Colin Firth was the PERFECT Darcy, I can't imagine anyone better for the role!I have watched this miniseries about once a month for the past year, and I can't imagine I'll ever get tired of it! In fact, the story itself is so engaging that even my husband (who hates what he calls ""tally-ho"" movies) will sit and watch it with me almost every time! If you buy it, you won't be disappointed!"
5,One of my most beloved,"This is one of my favorite movies/series of all time. It is so beautifully done, and very very true to the original book. It's wonderful to see an adaptation where you actually hear the author's words! Costumes, props, locations, and acting are all superb.And how do you make it even more wonderful? Why, put it in Blu-ray! The remastering is such a vast improvement on the grainy original DVD set that we have. Lovely lovely lovely."
5,You'll Watch This Again And Again,"Superb acting, writing, and scenery join forces to do justice to Jane Austen's classic story of love and marriage. This DVD set is a fantastic gift for anyone who enjoys masterful storytelling and first-rate actors. The Blu-ray version is breathtaking!"
5,Nothing is better for a rainy day,"This is absolutely one of my very favorite movies of all time! BBC makes classic books into the best, most faithful movies. I also highly recommend their version of Jane Eyre. On rainy Saturdays, there is nothing I'd rather do than curl up in front of the TV with a cup of tea and watch this movie."
2,Pride and Prejudice DVD,"I am very disappointed with the product, I have the original recording from 1996, and your version is approximatly 2 hours short, a whole chapter of the story was chopped off. I do not recommend this video."
1,Do not buy it,"It is missing a huge portion of the movie. It's a terrible copy. It's my favorite version, I know it well. This is a shame."
1,Terrible transfer - complete color loss.,What a shame that this wonderful film has been released with such a poor handling of color in the transfer! Where on earth was quality control? I've never seen anything so washed out! I had been waiting some time for this Special Edition so that I could view Pride & Prejudice in its widescreen format. Don't waste your money unless you're sure these errors have been corrected. I'm going to try to get my money back now.
5,Best Movie Ever,This movie is one of the Best movies. If you are ever down in the dumps or crossed in love this movie is definitley a must watch. Pride and Predjudice is one of my very favorite movies. I would recommend this to any one.
1,DVD - SPecial Version Review - Not a review of P&P,"After owning the original DVD version since it was released, Iwas ready for this release, no more annoying breaks every hourwith the same listing of actors. I really wanted to view theextras that were with this version. But what a waste of money,I now watch the original,. and the new one is collecting dust.The picture quality was/is horrible, all the colors washed outin the scenery and the faces/clothes of the actors. This is thelast DVD purchase I will make that comes from A&E Entertainment.What a shame, because I was a satisfed customer until now.BTW - The movie no matter the picture quality is awesome and well worth the money."
5,Totally yummy,"This is THE definitive adaptation of Pride and Prejudice and is as much pleasure to watch as the novel itself is to read. The actors are superbly cast and the language and scenes are faultless (yes, even those Jane Austen could NEVER have written, such as Mr. Darcy working off his sexual frustration with an impromptu dip in the lake). Colin Firth is very sexy as Mr. Darcy. I could watch him looking at Jennifer Ehle's Elizabeth Bennett while she plays the piano in his home all day.However, this is not just a treat for the girlies. My husband also loves this series and we have watched it together at least 3 or 4 times since we bought it last year."
5,It doesn't get any better than this,"I confess, I hate series. I usually find them sadly lacking compared to (good) movies. Well, not this time. This series surpasses everything you have ever seen on TV and probably ever will see! Regardless of the genre. Most movies (I'm talking good historical films) also pale in comparison. This is an incredible piece. Not only is it sublimely acted (at all levels since there isn't a single bad actor, but particularly Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle who are both extremely convincing), but the costumes, the music, the exteriors and set designs are absolutely perfect. The sharp eye will notice a few (but oh so minor) technical errors, but they take nothing from the enjoyment. Beware though, it is addictive! You may need your Darcy/Lizzy daily fix afterwards. And you'll love every minute of it I promise!"
4,Bravo,This movie was excillent. The original 6 disks down to 2. pictire quality is on par. I always enjoyed the movie with it's classic apeal
5,I finally have it on DVD!,"After watching this miniseries for years on VHS tapes (taped off the TV, mind you), I was so excited to get the DVD. No commercials, and clear sound and picture. What a thrill! AND, there were parts of the movie that were cut from the version on I saw on A&E. I sat enraptured as I watched the DVD, never sure when a new scene would pop up. It was like watching it for the very first time. I do agree that there should have been more extras included, but that didn't seem to matter as I was watching the movie. The new P&P release this Christmas, with Keira Knightley as Elizabeth, has mighty big shoes to fill."
1,not good,"I was disappoint in the color of the movie, it was washed out. I have the video and the color was excellant, just like when I watched it on A&E years ago. I just watched it on PBS and the color was fine. I would not recommend this dvd."
3,Great movie but painful to watch,"I own the Special Edition DVD set. I enjoy this BBC series very much but boy, the DVD transfer quality is utmost terrible.Like one of the reviewers mentioned, the color is washed out; the contrast is way off. The advertised widescreen format is somewhat deceptive. It looks as though someone chopped off the top and bottom from the 4:3 version. As a result, in many scenes the heads and feet are chopped from the screen. The picture looks very grainy and is no where near the quality one may expect from DVD. Frankly, one is better off to watch the VHS version.It's unfortunate that we tossed the VHS collection when we bought this DVD set a few years ago. I should have transfered that into DVDs.It's still a lovely movie to watch and one may be immensed in the story enough to forget the painful quality... for the most part."
5,Peace & quiet,"Wonderful movie, can't beat a product like this as it gave me 5 hours peace and quiet whilst the boss watched it!"
5,An Excellent Film,I have the VHS version of this movie and I love it. I have watched it at least 10 times through. I am even considering buying the DVD version as I no longer have a VHS player. I highly recommend it. If you are a Jane Austen fan this is the movie for you (and even if you're not) I wished it would continue on. A sequel.
5,Pride and Prejudice,A very enjoyable BBC version of this Jane Austen classic. Length of the movie is very long--it was created as mini series--but on DVD it is a pleasure to watch. Colin Firth is a great Mr. Darcy for Jennifer Ehle's portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet.
5,Best P&P,No one but Colin Firth will ever be Darcy for me. This is the best version of the Austen book. I watch it at least once a year. Great period love story.
4,Very happy with this product.,"I am very pleased with this purchase. It has great picture and sound, came fast in shipping and I would say it is a very good purchase for anyone to make."
4,Excellent!,"This reproduction of Pride and Prejudice is the best I have ever seen. It is somewhat long, originally aired as (6) TV mini-series movies, played one after the other, but is quite worth it! Colin Firth plays an excellent Darcy (much like many of the other characters he plays). Jennifer Ehle is a fantastic Elizabeth full of wit and energy. All the supporting actors are true to the image as well. The book included in this set is interesting and full of fun facts.If you are a Jane Austen fan, this movie is a must, (however you may want to just purchase the regular boxed set instead of the Collectors Edition)."
5,Good movie,"This Pride and Prejudice stays more true to the book than others I've seen. Colin Firth does a wonderful job as Mr. Darcy, as he has certain ""looks."" Since it is a mini-series and longer than a movie, it is able to capture more scenes and subtleties than the older black and white or the newer movie."
5,I love this movie!,"This is the hands-down best version of Pride and Prejudice. Long--but long enough to capture the story in every detail, yet without being boring. This is the only period romance I know that men enjoy watching--every man I know that's watched it has loved it (even if they feel guilty about it. :) )I already own my own copy of this--I bought one for a friend for Christmas. I cannot recommend it enough--it's my favorite movie of all time."
5,The best ever,"I'm almost 70, and have seen hundreds of movies, a few of which were very good. This one is by far the best one ever. It takes you for a ride you will never forget, with none of today's gimmicks, only truly superb writing and acting. Young and old, men and women, are all enchanted. Don't miss it."
5,Long and addictive,Carve out a chunk of time for this series. It is high quality and really nicely done. The scenery is breathtaking and authentic. I'll watch it again and again when I get time.
5,"Great, a must-see","I actually prefer this movie to the book, which is rare. A great film with strong, memorable characters. Simple as that!"
3,Very good,"I liked this version very much. For purists it is the closest version to the book the acting is excellent. Colin Firth is amazing and Miss Ehle Is so beautiful, she looks like a Dresden Doll.... though she smiles a little too much which made her look a little too coy for my taste. What bothered me most however is that parts of the movie look very faded... I have to say I like the spirit and vibrancy of the Kiera Knightly version much better. Perhaps it is because that is the first adaptaion I viewed. I own both however both are very much worth seeing, go well together hand in hand. I give this movie a thumbs up"
3,"Wait and say ""Best"" after you've seen the 1980 BBC's version","I bet most people here praising for this A&E version of ""Pride and prejudice"" haven't seen the 1980 BBC's version or even read the book. The ealier BBC's version is less known because it's not advertised as much as this one and it's more than 15 years older. The A&E version is good in its detailed potrait and fine production. It has a more modern taste to the original Jane Austen's novel. The earlier BBC's version is more theatical played by a superb cast, esp. Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul in the leading roles as Lizzie and Darcy who are true to the book. You may disagree about some characters. I strongly urge those who like this A&E production go and watch the other BBC version so that you can get a full taste of the original Austen's ""Pride and prejudice""."
3,Let me see what actors are saying.,"I am surprised that this important work is presented with no hint of captions or subtitles. How hard can it be when creating the work for publication to include this worthwhile device, i.e. the track for captions?"
3,pride,one of the discs wasn't reconditioned properly and it skips. word word word word word word word word word word word word
2,Not the best,"This is an okay version of Pride and Prejudice, but not the most superior one. It strays from the book quite a bit (I don't recall Darcy jumping in swamps nor even fencing) The acting is bland exept for Julia Sawalha, who is most melodramatic and Jennifer Ehle's smirking gets old quickly. The scenery is beautiful, however and so are the costumes.The 1979 BBC version, with a screenplay by Fay Weldon, is a far superior version. The movie is bang on with the book and the acting is fantastic--the actress portraying Lydia is a little histrionic and melodramatic, but the rest are pure perfection."
2,"2010 ""restored"" edition is missing Episode 4","Beware, the 2010 ""restored"" edition is incomplete. It's missing Episode 4.Disc 1 contains Episodes 1-3Disc 2 contains Episodes 5-6"
5,Very good way to enjoy Jane Austin's talent.,"Ever try reading Pride and Prejudice, the novel by Jay Austin? It will put you to sleep. However, the movie as brought to life by this production, is painless. It is well acted and very enjoyable. I streamed it first, then bought it, as it is well worth another look."
2,Pass on this one.,"My wife and I are huge fans of A&E's Pride and Prejudice starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. We were exited by the prospect of a 10th anniversary edition of the film, expecially the interviews and retrospectives promised by this edition. The DVD special interview were very disappointing and primarily feature the actors playing Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, Mary Bennet and Mr. Wickham. While their interview were interesting, the main characters are conspicuously absent. I will likely sell my copy on eBay and wait for a more in-depth special edition that has video interviews with all the cast--especially the main characters. Also, the behind the scenes clips are very limited. While the booklet is okay, it would have been nice if the producers had invested more time and attention to this edition's special features. If they had, I would have been willing to double for it!"
5,Blu-ray Review,"This has been my favorite movie ever since the first time I saw it back in '96. I just received the Blu-ray version yesterday and I have to say...BEAUTIFUL! I compared the picture quality of the DVD and Blu-ray side by side and I am abundantly pleased with the Blu-ray. The colors just pop and if it's possible, I actually love this movie even more now that it's not all washed out in beige! If the paleness of the movie has ever been an issue, you will not be disappointed with the Blu-ray and for $20 it's worth every penny!"
5,Loving recreation of Jane Austin's masterpiece,"The producer and director set out to recreate Jane Austin's world and her people, and they succeeded. The loving detail of place, form, color, music, dance and acting in this glorious production brilliantly projects the viewer into the early 19th Century world of the landed gentry - a dreamland of beauty and wit.The acting, (with the unfortunate exception of Allison Steadman as Mrs. Bennett who overacts shamelessly, and sounds like a rusty saw scraping on metal), is so superior to anything an American could see on television, that it is like entering a new plane of existence. Best are Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, although the actors who played Ms. Lucas and Mr. Bingly were also terrific.Great extra features, too, although I would have LOVED an interview with Colin Firth, who is to die for!If you haven't seen it, you are a deprived person!"
5,"It just doesn't get any better!(""Be still my beating heart"")","Exquisite production of Jane Austen's most prized novel. (It was her personal favorite work, as it is mine.) I read the book before I ever saw the movie, and felt it was the only one to really stay true to the novel. Just watching the movie made my heart beat faster, as the book had done. It doesn't let go, and at the end it left me craving more. I could watch this movie everyday. I have developed an obsession over this story, I just can't get enough."
5,Excellent production,"I was very impressed with this interpretation of one of my favorite books, and I also enjoyed the high quality of the DVD.Normally, I avoid watching film interpretations of books I love, but several factors made me change my mind and watch this production: (1) I heard so many high praises for this miniseries; (2) enough time had passed since I last read Austen's novel that I figured I might be safe from making disappointing comparisons, and (3) I loved Colin Firth so much in _Bridget Jones's Diary_ (another one I finally broke down and watched after having read the book when it first came out), I just had to see him in this role on which his _Bridget_ character was based. Anyway, I was not at all disappointed but rather completely engaged. My disappointment came only when the film ended. A delightful ""must-see""! I agree with previous reviewers that this adaptation stays impressively true to Austen's text."
5,Wonderfully faithful adaptation,"This DVD is an incredible version of one of Austen's greatest works. The format is easy to use, and the original breaks with credits of the mini-series give perfect stopping points in a very long film. The scenery is not only true, it is beautiful, the acting is great, and the story line is beautifully preserved, with little left out. We absolutely love it and have watched it over and over again."
3,Pride and Prejudice,"I'm disappointed with this supposedly enhanced/improved version. For some reason, the picture quality of the movie is somehow ""paled"" in comparison to the earlier DVD release version which, even though has some digital glitches, has warmness to it. I tried to compensate by adjusting the TV color, hue, brightness, etc. but to no avail. Despite this new version having bonuses, I think they're not worth it if the movie itself suffered from the enhancement. I wished I didn't give away my original copy. Now, I'm only reviewing the DVD, not the movie. The movie is absolutely fantastic. I never get tired of watching it. If you want to buy a copy of this movie, get the first release version."
3,Ordered the wrong format,"Good. I ordered blu-ray by mistake, it should have been a Dvd instead.Doesn't play on computer/laptop. Plays well on blu-ray disc player."
3,Colin Firth Is What Keeps The Movie Alive,"O.K I am a huge Colin Firth fan and after seeing ""Bridget Jones Diary"" I knew I had to buy this movie for I knew Colin would be the perfect Darcy and this was his break-out role.But, I found the movie rather dull and long focusing more on maintaining the story than, creating interesting dialouge or focusing on the passion between Darcy and Elizabeth. Colin is really the only one who delievers a good performances the rest of the cast I found rather boring and annoying except for Colin's close friend. I find myself straining to stay awake when I watch this DVD and I have started to just skip watching the first DVD and watch the second one instead where things begin to get interesting. I'll give it kudos for the set, costumes, and music but,all in all Colin Firth is the only reason worth watching this film!"
3,"The more I watch it, the more I like it...","I luv-luv-luv Pride and Prejudice, I've read the book countless amounts of times. Initially I wasn't moved by this movie and almost decided I didn't like it, but the more I watch it the more I like it. I like how it stayed true to the book more so then any other screen adaptation I've seen. I love Colin Firth in this movie he is the absolute perfect Mr. Darcy. Overall it's a good movie that for me gets better everytime I watch it..."
1,Go for the earlier BBC version instead,"Thoroughly unsatisfying, despite the presence of the always spectacularly sexy Colin Firth. The major flaw here is the horribly miscast Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth. She looks right, but is way too humorless, heavy, and grim in personality--all wrong for a character who wins the love lottery largely because of her sprightly wit and sweetness.In addition, Jane Austen's delicious dialogue is dumbed-down unforgivably in key moments. And the many minor characters who are supposed to offer piquant commentary on the money and love problems in this story are horribly mishandled. The actors are both weak and wrong, their scenes curtailed and stripped of meaning. This is Jane Austen done by people with NO FEELING for Jane Austen.The earlier BBC version with Elizabeth Garvey was superior in every way. And even without Colin Firth, ten times as romantic-- which is, after all, the whole point."
1,Do yourself a favour and read the book instead,They covered all the basic plot points but I think the movie lost something in so doing. Trying to cram everything into two hours left me scratching my head. I'd have to say if you don't read the book and you watched this movie you might not understand everything that was happening. All in all i wouldn't buy this flick.
2,No Match for the Original,"Really boring. Stick with the marvelous, original 1940 classic. How can A&E's wimpy cast possibly compete with Greer Garson, Laurence Olivier, Edna May Oliver, Ann Rutherford, Edmund Gwenn, et al? Answer: they can't. The 1940 original will be on DVD sooner or later, but in the meantime a decent VHS of this great old movie will at least keep you awake, which is more than I can say for this dreary DVD issue."
1,GREAT PRODUCTION - HORRIBLE DVD!,"A&E's production of ""Pride and Prejudice"" is a 5 star masterpiece; however, the DVD recording of it is just awful! The colors are either too dark or washed out, the sound is weak, and get this: the lips aren't in sync with the words being spoken!! Until they make a better DVD, stick with the Video set, where none of these problems are present."
4,The Best Version Ever Made,"This version of Pride and Prejudice, because it was originally a mini-series, doesn't leave out all the detail that the Hollywood version had to(which made the storyline very hard to follow-almost unbelieveable). Colin Firth plays his character well and keeps the mystery alive even if you've seen it over and over! Jennifer Firth is the perfect combination of beauty and spunk-her character is wonderfully outspoken for her time! Although long, this version is worth the watching if you want to truly see the book come to life! The only thing missing with this new DVD set would have been optional subtitles, because even when you get used to the accents I still feel like I miss some of the words and that would have been helpful. Otherwise I would have given it a 5 star rating!"
3,Not viewer friendly,"Good movie, BUT the music soundtrack overpowers the dialog, at times you simply can't hear what the actors are saying."
3,Video quality still poor in Special Edition,"From reading the more recent reviews, I had hoped that the video quality issues reported by other reviewers had been resolved, but I was very disappointed in the video quality of trhe Special Edition DVD. I understand that this was made for television in the days before HD, but if you are used to watching HD, this DVD seems like very poor quality. Like other reviews, I also had to change my TV settings to put color saturation to the maximum, which means that brown and navy become black, but at least you can differentiate pale faces from lace collars. I have a 34 inch wide screen television and this is the first time I have ever been grateful NOT to have a larger screen.If these issues are resolved with Blu-Ray, maybe it is time to start saving for a Blu-Ray player."
1,1 star only because of picture quality,"I've received this DVD for Christmas almost 2 years ago and I was so disappointed with the picture quality. Mine is all dark and the details of the costumes and furniture doesn't show.Before, I kept rending the DVD from Netflix and their disks were so nice (it wasn't the special edition though but the regular DVD which they have stoped selling by now). So I was used to seeing the nice detials, colors.Today, I've broke down and purchased a used copy of this older-version DVD from Amazon marketplace. I hope and pray that copy will have a nice picture quality because the movie is 5 stars otherwise and have watched it countless times!Good luck with your copy."
3,Disappointing,"While I enjoy the restored widescreen version of this Bluray, something went wrong. The picture is very, very grainy/pixelated. It looks like analog broadcast television. I'm really disappointed. Did anyone else notice this? I have a 55"" Samsung LCD TV and a Samsung Bluray player. I've not had this problem with any other Bluray."
5,Pride and Prejudice,"Love this version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" with Colin Firth. It is a classic so glad I have. Will have for generations."
3,Special Edition- such a disappointment,"This production of Pride & Prejudice is incredible; one of my favorite movies. Unfortunately, the quality of this ""Special Edition"" DVD is horrible. What bothered me the most was the unsychronized audio/video, and the shadowy lighting that blurred the lines between hair and background, etc.But besides that, the special features were hardly worth mentioning. I was expecting at least the standard deleted scenes, maybe a blooper reel, or at least decent subtitles. All that was included were a couple written biographies and one featurette that was sadly lacking in any kind of interesting stories from on set, details about the actual production, or interviews with more of the great cast members. I found that the clips from the movie that they used throughout the featurette were too long as well.This DVD set is nowhere near the quality of the actual production: don't miss watching this movie, but consider watching it on VHS or the older DVD instead."
3,So So,"After having seen the latest version with Kiera Knightly and Mathew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy, I found this version to be pretty much a let down. I have always enjoyed the roles I've seen Peter Firth in but I found his reprisal of Mr. Darcy to be downright boring. Also, I found the woman who played Lizzy's mother to be so shrill that I winced every time she came on screen. I kept waiting for the film to get better as the minutes wore on - but no such luck. A disappointment from some pretty good actors."
2,"Love P&P, hate the CD technology","I'm torn in this review. The CD/video is undoubtedly the best interpretation of ""Pride and Prejudice"". The actors, screenplay, and overall excellence of the production are unparalled. However, I am asked to rate this item. I had the full video set which I watched many times (comfort time). When I got my first DVD I was very unhappy with the reproduction. The colors, which were vivid on the video, were washed out, reds being pale, etc. I thought that that was one mistake so I ordered another and then another, all the same. I can hardly watch the CD's. The story remains wonderful, but the CD is miserable, and I have watched the original enough to hate watching the CD. Order at your own risk--the production is A class, the reproduction stinks."
3,Pride and Predjudice,While I liked this movie I don't think it can compare with the one starring Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen. That is the best one I have ever seen. It 1s superb.P.S. I am referring to the version with Colin Firth. Okay but not the best.
1,Returned movie twice,"I bought this movie, was disappointed with the quality and exchanged it for another one. The second one was worse and I returned it for a refund. I then ordered it from Costco, which turned out to be cheaper and a much better quality. This is a great classic movie and worth it to find a copy of good quality."
5,This movie rocks!,"This is a wonderful, captivating movie, and I love it from begining to finish. Firth and Ehle make a wonderful couple, and the story of head-strong Elizabeth Bennett and her suitor Fitzwilliam Darcy will reach the hearts of anyone. Don't miss this wonderful story!"
5,I'm glad my girlfriend insisted...,"My girlfriend begged me to,watch P&P for months. I tried to put this off as long as possible, figuring it was a typical period piece for the ladies. One night, with nothing else to dio, I finally gave in. After the first episode was over... I demanded she stay up for at least the second episode. And then I insisted we finish the whole series the following day. I guess I liked it. It was charming all around."
5,Who doesn't like this movie!,"I just wanted to join the chorus of praise for this movie. I especially liked the Special Edition DVD with the ""making of..."" feature and biographies. Everyone that likes anything close to period pieces, Jane Austen, BBC productions, etc. should own this!"
5,Wonderful Production,"I purchased this DVD after having seen the VHS (6 tape) version, my 12 year old daughter was watching daily for the DVD to arrive. The production is wonderful, its all well done, from the characters, (Elizabeth's mother is perhaps over done), to the dances and instruments. The scenery is beautiful. The video of the DVD is not as clear as the VHS version, and there are thumping noises at times."
5,Who wouldn't love this?!,It came in the condition expected and of course I've already seen the movie a million times so I knew I would love it.
5,Great verison of a classic movie!,From time to time the wife and I will sit down for this movie and it's a great story! This version is probably my favorite I really enjoy the actors and how they take on the roles of the characters.
5,RESTORED CINEMATOGRAPHY DVD = BESTSELLER,"Please allow me to thank you profusely for producing the finest, most perfect, most beautiful movie series ever made. I've watched the vhs series with my wife about 25 times over the years.Here is a respectful request. Could you release even another DVD version? This time it would be great if the gorgeous cinematography from the VHS series could be used. I am certain it would be a bestsellerPride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996)"
5,A great adaptation of a classic story,"I did things a little backward seeing this video series first, and then going on to read Jane Austen's book. But that's how much I loved it! When it was over I wanted more details on Elizabeth and Darcy and the book filled in those details. The video series is very true to the book and I found much of the dialogue is taken right from the pages of Jane Austen's novel. I thought that Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth were wonderful as Lizzie and Darcy. It's amazing to watch Colin Firth do some incredible acting without ever opening his mouth! He did a fabulous job acting a role that must have been incredibly difficult since he said so little yet expressed so much! This is truly my favorite film of all time. If you like it half as much as I did, you'll love it!"
4,Great new version,"This BBC TV miniseries was a hit from the beginning - it stayed true to the plotline of the novel, the actors were excellent (need I mention the droolworthy Mr. Darcy?), it had the right period setting and atmosphere, and it had great dialogue and music.I did have a bit of a problem with the color in this version, because at times it seemed slightly washed out, but otherwise the resolution is okay. The special features are nice, and it's lovely to watch the entire story for - what, four hours straight? Jane Austen fans, this is something you should definitely consider buying!"
4,Docked one star for lousy transfer,"Some parts are overacted, but this is generally a terrific production. But the color transfer is so poor, pale, and washed out that it looks almost bleached. The story is engrossing enough that after a time, the viewer grows accustomed, but if the company had any sense of honor, they'd reissue a quality edition and allow trade-ins."
1,awful dvd quality ruins wonderful adaptation,"I cannot agree more with previous reviews- this is the best adaptation of Pride & Prejudice yet, but the DVD is beyond sucking. I have the VHS tape set as well, which is perfect. The DVD in contrast is poorly formatted, comes across as a cheap copy with washed out bluish colors and muted sound. I have been through 2 DVDs thinking the first one was a fluke. DEFINATELY don't buy this until A&E re-releases it. The VHS tapes are wonderful, IF you still own a VHS recorder..."
5,Superbly Done!,"What an excellent adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. Beautiful scenery, costumes and wonderful acting make this movie a definite A+. Worth the time spent watching which is hard to say of many movies out there nowadays. Don't pass it by, I think Jane Austen would have been enamoured with it as well. Also, look into the ""Making of Pride and Prejudice"" book which is chock full of interesting tidbits from the film."
5,Most excellent movie!,"Since I first saw this movie, I have watched it many more times. Its length is a bit daunting at first, but it is so well worth the time! I loved the cast, the script, and just everything about it! It's a very pleasing way to spend an afternoon/evening. I highly recommend this movie."
5,Best Book Made into a movie!,This movie really captured Jane Austin's book quite well it made the book come alive for me and was very compelling . It kept you interested and in suspence the entire movie . For anyone who enjoys a indepth and truly romantic movie this is the one for you . I rate it 5 stars !
4,now I gotta hankering for Colin Firth...,"I saw this mini-series on a PBS station a few years ago and fell in love with it. Then I saw it for sale at a local video/music store - on DVD... it is long - but it's length is what makes it so involving.I truly wanted to be IN the movie - the acting is amazing, and the entire movie is wrought with Jane Austen's cutting-sarcasm that makes her STILL one of the first *real* feminists. She spoke out against the traditions of the English, but all-the-while remained a part of it. She truly is a genious.Colin Firth is now on my 'cutey' list - and he makes you hate him so much you love him. If you liked the Hollywood-version of Sense and Sensibility, you will ADORE this DVD set. Highly-recommended."
4,Pride and Prejudice (Restored Edition),"Love the story. The picture is clear, sound great. I would have liked to know that it is shown as a Mini-series and not just a straight movie. I really don't like the ending/beginning of the segments of the show, but that is the only thing I don't care for."
5,one of the best movie ever!!!,"THIS MOVIE IT HAD AN EXCELENT DIRECTOR AND PRODUCER, AND VERY GOOD ACTORS ASWELL, THERE'S NOT MUCH TO SAY IS IT JUST TOO GOOD THAT YOU DREAM ABOUT IT. THANKS TO A GREAT IMAGINATION. AND THE MOVIE CAME PERFECTLY GOOD WHAT MORE COULD I ASK, THANKS."
5,Invite the Girls Over and Prepare to Swoon!,"I've seen this particular adaptation at least five times, and I still haven't had enough. Yes, the writers, producers, cast and crew did an outstanding job, blah, blah, blah, but it's Collin Firth's performance as the proud and sexy Mr. Darcy that keeps my girlfriends and me coming back for a yearly encore. The man was made for this role--he oozes that smoldering masculinity, pure chivalrous romance that just doesn't exist any more. It's not in what he says, it's in what he doesn't say. All this and not even a kiss until the last scene! Now that's powerful..."
3,P&P Special Edition.,"I own the original BBC VHS tapes - not A&E, the first DVD and now the Special Edition DVD.The BBC edition is marvelous and contains an extra shot of Darcy watching the carriage leave Netherfield with Jane and Lizzy. This is not on either of the DVDs.The first DVD is great. It does have credits breaking up the individual parts of the original series but all in all the quality is close to the original tapes.However the latest Special Edition has lost the softness gained by using film instead of tape which I think helped the original. This version is sharper with far too much contrast. It's just a generally harsher look to the whole thing which I am sure the producers would hate. I'm not returning it as I adore the series and any version is worth collecting but for those of you wanting a pristine version on DVD, try to get hold of the first edition and skip this one."
1,Don't buy this DVD,"I just purchased this DVD and was greatly disappointed with the DVD production. I agree with the reviewer ""A viewer."" The digital remastering has changed the color tone of the film. The film color is washed out compared to the VHS version. The sound is tinny. Both of these issues makes the film uncomfortable to watch.I would highly recommend NOT buying this DVD. Rather, hope that one day the film production company will make another DVD returning the beautiful color and sound one can find in the original release."
1,Prefer VHS and 200th Ann. version over the Special Edition,"The BBC production of Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is one of my favorites.I am sadly disappointed in the re-mastered wide-screen Special Edition version (released 2001) of this wonderful production. Everything is greenish, as if it had been shot through a green filter. The images look like a second or third generation video tape copy. I cannot recommend it.In comparison, I was very pleased with the quality of both the VHS version (released 1998) of this production, and the 200th Anniversary version on DVD in a full-screen format (released 1998).The content of the BBC production is wonderful -- acting, story, characters, costumes, scenery, music, etc. -- and I wish the quality of the wide-screen DVD version was as good as the content."
1,DVD Special Edition is an eSPECIALly Big Disappointment,"Let this be very clear: the ONE star is in very specific reference to the DVD Special Edition being a ""DOWNGRADE"" (as another reviewer called it) from the original VHS version. The picture and audio are not super terrible, it is just that it was a lot better on the VHS! Why did they mess it up like this?! The program itself is fantastic and I highly recommend it. My wife and I watch the whole series at least once or twice a year (not in one sitting, mind you!). For details on exactly what is wrong, please see the review from ""A viewer (Sandpoint, ID USA)."" I completely agree with them and would only add that darks and shadows tend to be completely black and devoid of any light and detail whatsoever."
5,Pride and Prejudice,This is by far the best production that has been created. I would recommend this to anyone!!
5,"An absolute classic, period.","Being a huge Jane Austen fan - especially Pride and Prejudice - there simply is nothing to compare to this production of the book. I had read the blue ray really made a difference and I believe it does. The picture and sound quality are noticeably better and I enjoyed every minute of it.One little difference that I just wasn't expecting - for each episode the entire before and after credits roll every time. Not a big deal, just need to keep the remote close if you are watching more than one episode at a time.Love it, love it, love it!"
5,The Best Pride and Prejudice Ever (5+ stars),"The A&E;/BBC version of Pride and Prejudice staring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is by far the best ever. The scenery, attention to detail and overall production is amazing.I owned the Special Edition and was given 10th Anniversary Limited Edition Collector's Set as a gift by someone who knew my opinion of this movie."
5,The ending is worth it,"This is a very long miniseries that is best when seen all together in one sitting. This can be difficult, but the end makes your time worth it. This is a funny and romantic movie that is true to Jane Austin's original work."
5,Colin Firth at his best!,"This version of Pride and Prejudice is hands down the best version made to date. Colin Firth is fantastic as the arrogant and aloof Mr. Darcy. Jennifer Ehle is great at playing the smart and whitty Elizabeth Bennet. This version is somewhat long, but it just makes you hungry for more. I love Jane Austen's work, the classic romance story lines are great and I never get tired of watching Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensiblity."
5,good movie,I was pleased with the timely manner I recieved the movie and the price I recieved. I got this on the bonus buy. I enjoyed the movie and it is of good quality. No complaints. Thanks.
5,Pride & Prejudice,I am a Jane Austin type of girl! I love all of the versions of Jane Austin's Pride & Pejudice from Olivier to Collin Firth. You can not resist Mr. Darcy.
5,"Amazing. Period, dot.","I'm usually pretty skeptical about my favorite books being made into movies, but this is far and away one of the best adaptaions of Jane Austen I have ever seen. Colin Firth is incredible as Darcy, and Jennifer Ehle makes a wonderful Elizabeth Bennet. It is much more on target than the Laurence Olivier version, though that might have as much to do with the fact that the BBC version is over twice as long as it does with the exceptional adaptation. In short, I was totally blown away by this....but what else could you expect from A&E and the BBC except excellence?"
5,Wonderful wonderful Wonderful,I can not do the film justice with my explanation. Just view it ... six hours will fly by quicker than you can ever imagine.
5,One of the Best!,"This production of Pride and Prejudice is one of the Best Ever.No one will deny that Colin Firth is the Best fit to PlayMr Darcy, and Jennifer Ehle is the most perfect Elizabeth, herfacial expressions is acting enough, no need for words.My daughter and I Love this production and have followed it fromit VHS days, trying to watch it at least every year. This DVDis the Best of them All so far, in quality.Very Happy!"
5,Wonderful transition to blueray- must have for fans of the series,"Like many people this is one of my favorite programs- I watch it fairy often on dvd.The transition to bluray is fantastic. The picture is remarkably better! All the sudden I can see the texture of fabrics and sun dappling through a window or kissing the grass- it is gorgeous!There are also lots of small moments and cuts that have been slightly extended. This isn't a big deal, but I you have watched the series as often as I have it is a nice touch. For example at the beginning of the film viewers will now see a a quick shot of Mrs. Bennet talking excitedly to her friends then she will tell her family the news that a Mr. Bingly will be leasing Netherfield. It doesn't impact the story, but for fans like me it is a lovely touch."
5,This is the best movie ever made!!!,"Who doesn't fall madly in love with Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennet from the first moments of this movie? The story is absolutely true to the book, and the characters are so warmly portrayed by the actors, that every time I finish watching the 6 hour series of tapes, I feel like I'm putting my dearest friends away in a box on my shelf! Even my husband, a total ""Terminator"" kind of guy, loves this movie."
5,The Perfect Story,Pride & Predjudice is a must read - and this movie version is a must see - over and over. It is perfect!
5,Good quality movie!,If you haven't seen this show it is really well made. Product came quickly and in the condition listed. Thanks!
5,great quality DVD,Item is in great condition and it was for the best price I found anywhere online. Shipped fast.
4,Uniformily Charming!,"The film itself is utter perfection. It gets better every time I watch it! However, I have to give this DVD only 4 stars because the quality leaves something to be desired. I don't mind the widescreen transition; it's the color of the film that bothers me. A former owner of the 6-tape collection, I know how the colors of this movie are intended to look, rich and fall-like, and to accomodate this new DVD I have to turn my contrast way down so as to not be blinded by the washed-out whiteness of the movie! I don't know why they would mess with colors, and that's my only qualm with this DVD."
5,"Run, don't walk, to buy this DVD!","Loved every minute of it and have watched it over and over again. Best adaptation ever of my favorite Jane Austen book. The acting is superb, the scenery is spectacular and the costumes are beautiful. You will not be disappointed, except when the last DVD ends."
4,Long but good,Long but good; one of my favorites. Still trying to get my boyfriend to watch it with me...not going to hold my breath.
4,classic story!,"My daughter and I were anxious to watch this together, because we love period films. I gave this to her for a Christmas gift, and we watched it over two nights. The story was wonderful, but I agree with a previous reviewer about the quality of the dvd being poor, the sound was not great and the picture looked grainy in parts. All this being said, it WAS worth purchasing and we enjoyed it a lot. Colin Firth was great!"
4,pride n prejudice,The item came in a timely matter and in good condition. I have watched it and there seemed to be a glitch in one area but I backed it up and played again and it seemed fine. Excellent movie!
5,Very professional and Quality Viewing,"I am happy to have this version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" a part of my library. The finest, quality viewing and the story is informative and truly enjoyable. I watch the DVD often and never get tired of it. It is also enjoyed by my family of ages 28 to 65. I highly recommend this to everyone. The acting is supberb and believable. I can't say enough to promote this movie. The romance is handled beautifully and respectfully. Just buy it!"
5,Beautifully done!,"I'm just now getting into Jane Austen and have been watching and reading everything I've been able to find. Pride and Prejudice is a beautiful story of how first impressions aren't always right and how ones pride, if left unchecked, can easily get in the way of happiness. This is not only the best film adaptation of P&P; I've been able to find, but the acting is splendid as is the costuming and setting. Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle have amazing chemistry.The Blu Ray addition is perfection. The restoration is very well done. Color and sound are fantastic. I, honestly, cannot say enough good about either the film or the Blu Ray edition."
5,movie review,Wow!! What an amazing romance!!! Anyone with an eye for good movies will enjoy this one immensely!! A & E has done a wonderful job with this production.
4,collector's set,"This is a great product, especially for Jane Austen fanatics like myself. The only thing I was disappointed with was in the extra disc, none of the really important main characters are featured. It would have been interesting to see what they thought about the movie and to get their take on everything. Other than that it is fantastic. The biography portion is interesting and the book with all of the pictures from the making of the movie are fun."
5,Pride and Prejudice - The Winner!,"This version of Pride and Prejudice is hands down the best one. It tracks closest to the book than all the other versions of P&P out there, including the more recent ones. When you watch it, you are seeing the real Jane Austin. The writers/directors/producers did an exceptional job."
4,Jane Austen on film,"An annoying mother, amusing father and their five daughters star in this role as the family of choice. Mrs. Bennet is determined to find the richest young men possible for her children, so when Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy step into the country, the family is in uproar. This movie is filled with wit and couples. Many obstacles block the road to true love and it is enjoyable to watch them overcome each barrier. A wonderful show if you don't mind annoying mothers. Read the book for the whole story!"
5,Best adaption of a Jane Austin novel I have ever seen!,"I absolutely loved the novel ""Pride and Prejudice"". If allowed, I could go on and on about it. However, when screen versions of famous novels are released, it is almost always the case that certain elements are left out, new ones are added, or the plot is completely changed. Thus, screen versions rarely turn out to be as good as the original novel. Yet, this version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" is a definite exception. The casting, the setting, the plot, and the portrayal of the characters all followed the book religiously, and more than surpassed my every expectation. This is, undoubtedly, one of the very best screen adaptations of a novel ever done. Even if you have never read a Jane Austin novel, or seen a movie based on one of her novels, I still recommend this mini-series as a wonderful romantic comedy, complete with plot twists and turns you may very well never see coming. This is one of my favorite movies, period. I highly recommend it."
5,Best adaptation ever! Superb!,"If you don't think a movie can do justice to a great book, you haven't seen Pride and Prejudice. The cast is terrific: Colin Firth is the perfect Mr. Darcy -- now I can't see him in any movie that I don't think of Darcy (I was enraged watching ""The English Patient"" because his wife was betraying him!!!); Jennifer Ehle is witty, pretty (not more than Jane), and elegant (as I'd always pictured Lizzy). They even *look like* those on the cover of the Pride and Prejudice book I have! The adaptation is wonderful, some parts are even verbatim (I *have* watched it with the book in hand!). You don't even feel the 5 hours go by! One of my favorite movies, adapted from one of my favorite novels -- what more can I ask for? END"
1,Awful reproduction quality very disappointing,"After viewing the video version, what a disappointment to see the DVD! All the rich, beautiful colors and details of the video are either washed out to white or lost in dark shadow on the DVD. How A&E can claim this is 'remastered' is amazing when it looks like a bad bootlegged version. I've written to A&E--no response. They are probably tired of the complaints from fans of the original. But I would not purchase any other items related to A&E because of the poor quality and poor customer service. There are some snippets of scenes in the 'behind the scenes' portion of the DVD that have the original high-quality color. Too bad it was lost in the 'remastering'."
2,Pride and Prejudice Restored Version,"I eagerly anticipated the restored version of Pride and Prejudice, as my older version had gotten worn. However, I could not tell the difference in picture quality at all. Also, the restored version inserted the lead-in and credits before and after every episode, while the version I had only did at the beginning and end of each DVD (2 each total). The new version has 6 lead-ins and 6 credits for a total of 12! Extremely annoying and unnecessary."
4,Pride & Prejudice DVD,"Although I love the story and actors, I find it unfortunate that the DVD has been produced without an option for subtitles in English for the deaf and hard of hearing. If anyone knows of a version I can buy which has subtitles as an option, that would be wonderful. My other favorite Jane Austen, Persuasion, has subtitles and I watch it all the time."
5,The Best Show I Have Seen All Year!!!!,"Rather Extrodinary Movie. It was abuslty delightful. As wonderful as the book. I beilive that that is my most favortive book of all time! Splendid acting by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle! They are just how I pictured, Mr. Darcy, and Miss Elizabeth Bennet. Superb movie. One I must get!!!!!! Try it today! I bet 99.9% that you will truly love this movie. Good Day! If you have this movie and do not prefer it, I would by greatful to have it!!!"
1,Pride and Prejudice,I rated it one star because the last disc in the set did not work. I watched 4 hours of the movie and couldn't watch the ending. I love this movie it's one of my all time favorites. Very disappointing.
3,Great film; poor DVD quality,"I love Jane Austen adaptations, and this is one of my absolute favorite ones, so you can imagine my extreme disappointment when the DVD was of such poor quality. The colors was poor, the contrast off. Blacks were so dark that there were no highlights and the lights were washed out and faded. I've seen this movie dozens of times and the rotten quality was so distracting. Even adjusting my television set did not help make this poor production watchable.Boo-hiss to A&E for not producing a better DVD (and from what I've seen from other online reviews of this and other A&E productions, I am not alone in my feelings). Be very careful when buying any A&E DVD. Stick to the VHS or tape it off of the television."
3,OK,"There are two movies made based on this book, and this version of it is NOT the best one, but it is definitely worth owning.It omits too many details (I've read the book) for it to be accurate, and is not as interesting as the first movie made based on the same story."
3,"6 of one, half dozen of the other","This review is for the quality of the new DVD edition only, NOT of the miniseries, which is awesome, or of the the perfect Jane Austen story.I have both DVD versions now and neither one satisfies completely. In the first edition, the colors are washed out flat, and the overall look is quite muddy and blah. In the second version, the colors are kind of blown out, with far too much contrast for my eyes. However, the second (newer) version at least HAS some color in it, and because of the widescreen presentation, it is my overall favorite.I'm afraid this wonderful series must have been shot with untalented lighting people using inferior film. It's the only way to explain such [cruddy] transfers...in two tries! Nevertheless, the acting and story make this well worth it, and for those reasons alone, I recommend purchase."
2,Murky DVD Transfer,"I'll limit my comments to the technical quality of the DVD transfer, which is, in a word, terrible. I do realize that material created for broadcast won't look as good as material created for theatrical projection. That said, DVD should easily carry studio-quality video, and this DVD is nowhere near that. It is gritty, squirmy, and unsharp. The BBC and A&E can and should go back to the ?16 mm? film sources to create a new transfer that does justice to an otherwise-excellent production."
3,pride and prejudice,"The plot and acting on this DVD are strictly five-star. But the qualty of the video is distressingly worse than what was broadcast on PBS; quite poor by modern standards. You may be able to set that flaw aside as you become engrossed in the story, but it's inexcusable that you should have to."
1,Aussies - don't buy this DVD,"I am a big fan of this mini-series, which I have viewed many times on video. I therefore went to the expense (almost $A100) of buying the DVD for my new state-of-the-art home theatre. The quality of this DVD is the worst I have ever seen and is much worse than watching the video through the home theatre system. I am surprised that the BBC allowed its release. Of course I cannot return the DVD now that it has been opened but it is a complete waste of money because it is virtually unwatchable. If I had purchased the item here in Australia, I would be protected by law from having to accept it because it is not ""of merchantable quality"". However, buying on the net carries certain risks. Let the buyer beware!!"
5,Super performances,"The beauty of Pride and Prejudice, always a timeless piece of literature, is captured in the film through outstanding cinematography and superb acting on the part of all characters. Colin Firth does his usual outstanding performance as his character captures so well the vagaries of his nascent relationship and his inability to determine where he sees himself in English society of the period. If viewers wish to recapture the feelings and imagery of this historical period, Pride and Prejudice will offer satisfaction."
5,Delicious and riveting,"My daughter and I are addicted to this beautifully done adaptation. We watch it often and cannot count the times we have viewed it. We only wish it would go on forever. Colin Firth will always be Mr. Darcy for us. The acting is flawless--the scenery and costumes, beyond reproach. It cannot be improved upon in any way. The series is perfection. I only wish we could have many more such mini series."
3,pride and prejudice -DVD,"I have the VHS tape and the DVD. I love this BBC series. I would rate the story, actors, screenplay, and direction as 5 stars on VHS. As a DVD version, I was not very happy. I hoped the picture quality was better. There were no additional features (i.e...added or behind the scene clips), sub-titles or wide screen that are some features found to be advantagous to DVD."
4,Highly Diverting,"This is the most in-depth and well-done version of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. I've watched it repeatedly, since it was originally released, and continue to be intrigued by the acting and the story nuances. There were some weird stickers on the DVD case which disappointed me and that I didn't expect because they weren't in the picture of the DVD. These were the sellers, I think. They should have been removed or the disc should've been discounted, since the cover is defaced."
5,"Okay, Okay....I watched it too. (From Him)","I ususally don't care for romances, preferring action, adventure, and wildlife shows to the touchy-feeliness of Jane Austen.But...Pride and Prejudice is a remarkable piece of work.From the breathtaking beauty of the English countryside, to the dramatic tension of the story-line, to the exquisite acting, I found myself hanging on every word and hooting and hollering as Lizzie gives stuffed-britches Darcy what-for.Distinctions of class, royalty, social status and wealth separate the characters and pit them against each other. You can almost see the hand of time sweeping away the puny efforts of man and his pride and privelage. But the passions remain, in full force, in this beauty of a story.An elegant drama - enjoyable in every respect!"
2,bad color,"Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful story, and Colin Firth is great. The original was beautiful, but the color on this dvd is terrible. I sent it back."
5,A wonderful film!,"I very much disagree with the reviewer down below. What did you mean about taking God's name in vain? I'm a religious person and there was certainly nothing blasphemous here. As to not being romantic enough, personal tastes differ and I for one preferred the restrained passion here since it made it much more romantic IMHO. The length helps deepen the characters and the plot and I for one am grateful for it. I'm sorry Barlow but I watched this after seeing your review and I thoroughly disagree."
5,WARNING: HIGHLY ADDICTIVE,"My, my, my, words fail me.Breathtaking.. Colin Firth.... MasterpieceForget about all those Oscars, all those flash hollywood stars, blockbusters. This is THE movie you MUST NOT miss."
2,Wish I'd read the reviews . . .,"I'm a huge fan of P&P--both the novel and the miniseries. I'm sorry to say that previous reviewers are right. The ""Special Edition"" is--quite literally--a washout. While the sound is good (and widescreen Colin Firth can never be a bad thing), the transfer is terrible. The colors, contrast and shading apparent in the video or original dvd versions are almost non existent in this ""special"" version. If you're a widescreen purist (or just want double the Colin) go ahead and invest--otherwise, your other version is probably just fine."
2,Buy the VHS & wait for a better DVD version,"The DVD color is a disaster! The only consolation is that I'm not alone in my opinion. The adaptation itself is brilliant, and having enjoyed the VHS, I decided that modern technology being what it is (or so I thought), the DVD version would be convenient to own. I'm keeping the VHS plugged in."
3,Does not beat the BBC production,"I thought that this version was not as true to the book, and that the Mr. Darcy played by Colin Firth was not convincing what so ever. I have seen both versions of pride and prejudice and have read the book, and the BBC production with Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul tops them all! I thought that it was truer to the book, as well as having a very convincing Mr. Darcy, the other you would not have known that Mr. Darcy even liked Elizabeth! I dont recommend this version, and I think that putting it on six tapes is a rip off, because it can fit on two."
4,"still very good, but...","after watching this a second time (a yr later), i have a slightly different opinion. i still think it's wonderfully entertaining, but i think the characterisation is a little too modern. the women, especially, are too forward: they lack the manners and decorum that one would expect in the gentry of that time. in this sense, the bbc production comes closer to the mark. but it's still a very good show."
2,oooohhhheeeeewwwww mistah Dahsee!!!!,Geesh...I know Austen fans love this adaptation of the novel. My own wife watched the whole thing. I however could not force myself to suffer through the constant supercilious preening and exclaiming of the women. If women were truly like this back then...then I am deeply thankful I was born into this era. I do not feel the over the top depiction of the women does justice to Austen's insightful and humorous novel. Indeed.
3,Hmmmm,"It has been said that this is THE Pride and Prejudice...the best of the lot, but I disagree. In spite of the fact that Colin Firth plays Mr. Darcy, the movie, while beautiful, lacks a certain spark. Some of the scenes seem quite drawn out and there is no passion to be felt. I much prefer Pride and Prejudice with Keira Knightley where emotion, tension and passion leap from the screen and one cannot help but be drawn into the story itself. Darcy is excellent, as is the entire cast. Truly a much better version in every way. And for fun be sure not to miss Lost in Austen where someone from our time travels to Ms. Bennet's time. It's wonderful and so much fun. As for this version...I'd skip it and go for the other two."
2,Disappointed Viewer,"I greatly anticipated the arrival of my Pride and Prejudice tape set. I set aside the perfect moment and the perfect time so that I could indulge in all six volumes back to back. I had recently read the book and was quite excited to see it acted out. Much to my dismay the movie was a bit dull and in some instances hard to follow. Had I not read the book, I would not have had a clear understanding of some of the scenes. Overall, the movie contained many many elements of the book, but perhaps my expectations were simply too high. I did not find Jennifer Ehle particularly convincing as Elizabeth Darcy. She made annoying faces and appeared considerably older than her implicit age of around 20. It's worth watching, but it's not as intriguing as I had hoped. Maybe I will find another version of the book more to my liking."
2,Brooding on P&P,"It's all very well for reviewers to rave about Colin Firth's brooding Darcy. He does well enough, given that he has no-one to play against. The smirking, complacent Jennifer Ehle is so badly miscast as Elizabeth that the entire production is undermined. The shrill overacting of Alison Steadman and the (again) miscasting of Jane do not help. The book is far more subtle, with nuances completely ignored by the scriptwriter who prefer to have Elizabeth constantly striking pert poses as a substitute for the actress having to display any emotion. This is like watching Gone With The Wind without Vivien Leigh. If the two leads are mismatched the entire point is lost, no matter how elaborate the production values."
4,Great!,"This is a thoroughly entertaining, although quite long, adaptation of the book. The casting and acting were great, although Mrs. Bennett is a litte too shrill and overdone. Colin Firth is a perfect Mr. Darcy, no wonder it made him a heart throb. The actress who plays Eliza is charming, and I wonder what has become of her. She is not the usual waifish actress, which is refreshing. Overall, this is a wonderful movie, sure to be a classic."
2,Restored???,"I bought the 2010 restored edition, it is worst than the original dvd I had and broke. The colour and brightness changes with each episode, if not every scene, and I have to adjust my screen settings every 10 mn. May be my copy was bad, but it is a deception."
5,Perfect!,"I have watched this mini-series countless times and for me,it is by far the best adaption of Pride and Prejudice . The series really captures the comedy of manners of Jane Austens novel that the recent adaption lacks. The acting is superb as well as the music, costumes and locations. Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth are excellent as Elizabeth and Darcy respectivly and have great chemistry.I also enjoy the portrayal of Mr Bennett,whose humor has been transfered very well onto the screen. The 300 minute length may put some people off, but for me, it is thouroughly enjoyable throughout and by the end, I am always left wanting more! The new movie starring Kiera Knightley, while also very good, simply does not compare to this wonderful adaption."
2,Get the VHS version,"The DVD Special Edition is of inferior quality. The VHS edition has excellent color, whereas the DVD is washed out. You are wasting your money on the dvd, unless you absolutely cannot play VHS. The content is the same, although we did not finish watching the DVD version because of the poor quality. Very disappointing."
2,DVD version is UGLY,"This is such a wonderful show that it is with deep disappointment that I must report that the DVD version of it is HIDEOUS. My wife & I own the VHS tape set, and have watched them over & over, so I was very excited to get the DVD version in hopes that it would be even prettier & more lush than the tapes. But the lovely settings, rich costumes & etc are obliterated by the extreme over-exposed whitewash that the ""digital remastering"" has created. The characters all look like ghosts! We have gone back to watching the tapes.In short, the story is wonderful, the acting extraordinary, the casting, etc, etc, perfect, but this DVD version is really, really bad."
5,I ardently love and admire this movie,it may be about 5 hours long...but I can watch it again and again.
5,A Great Version of a Classic Novel,"This is an amazing, amazing DVD! The acting was superb and now I think I love Darcy even more! If you love the book, you'll love the movie. This is a DVD worth having for any Jane Austen fan!"
5,My Absolute Fave!,"I had to get the DVD because I wore out my VHS copy. I loved the story when I first read it in the 11th grade and have been hooked since, all the while searching for the quintessential transfer to film. I found it! Colin Firth brings so much life to the Darcy character. I like his interpretation.So if you loved the book I highly recommend this video."
5,Delightful adaptation,"I could watch this movie again and again. The acting is superb! It really brings Jane Austen's story to life. My favorite scene is where Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are in Mrs. Collins' sitting room and Mr. Darcy blunders royally his marraige proposal! If you love romance, there is simply no better movie."
4,Pride and Prejudice (Restored Edition),Another Jane Austen classic. Good character development and great acting make this a must have for your home DVD collection. This is one you'll gladly watch over and over.
4,Pride and Prejudice,"This is an Excellent version of Jane Austen's beloved novel Pride and Prejudice! It follows the book very well, unlike other cinematic adaptations of the novel. Colin Firth plays a captivating Mr. Darcy, and Jennifer Elhe's Elizabeth Bennet is both charming and delightful. Julia Sawalha's portrayal of Lydia Bennet is hilarous and true to Austen's character. Benjamin Whithrow and Alison Steadmen give wonderful performances as Mr. and Mrs Bennet, and the rest of the cast should be commended as well. I would recommend this movie to anyone. The cinematography and screenplay are excellent. My only objection to this DVD is that the credits are shown at the end of what would have been each episode in the mini series. Also, the DVD has no menu option. Otherwise, a great buy!"
1,Washed out color,"I love the novel. I also love the A&E produciton of the novel. I agree with the other viewers on the script, acting--this version is simply wonderful. However, the remastered version is awful. The colors are so overly bright that they are almost washed out. This DVD is almost painful to watch. I called A&E customer service and spoke to Vickie who had heard about the problem but had not seen the DVD. She didn't seem overly concerned and suggested the fault might be my DVD player. I am hoping that A&E gets a lot of complaints and then maybe they will do something about this problem. As for now, my advice would be not to buy it."
5,best rendition of story,Great acting. Best rendition that gives the full scope of what is going on and why. Other renditions were too short and could not develop every aspect of the story in depth like this one. Characters were very real in protrayal of their feelings.
2,Pride & Prejudice revisited,"The show itself is worth five stars. The DVD is not. I bought this for my wife's Christmas present. We love the show, had watched the VHS version over and over, and thought that the wide-screen DVD would be a good addition. The wide-screen and improved sound quality is really neat. However, the picture quality is so bright as to be washed out...compared either with broadcast or the older VHS."
2,Special Edition DVD is Horrible,"My wife and I own the VHS version of this masterpiece and absolutley love it. The story is fantastic and the cinematography wonderful....however, the special edition DVD is horrible. The colors are washed out with dark objects looking like blobs. I'm attempting to return the terrible DVD at this very moment. Stick with the VHS if you have a choice."
4,IMO the DVD is at least on par w/ the LD release,"I'd seen the original cable airing of this mini-series and absolutely adored it. It is, by far, my favorite Austen adaptation. I then purchased the laser disc box set. The DVD simply provides the best presentation at a fraction of the cost. While the video quality is certainly not stellar, in my opinion it is not inferior to the laser. (I would have liked to see an improvement, naturally. As I also wish that Image would have waited to make it a dual-sided, dual-layer release, thereby allowing the entire mini-series to fit on 1 disc. Still, I am not displeased.) I would recommend that any fan of the mini-series add this DVD to their library; it is a treasure. (Here I insert a plea for more A&E/BBC productions on DVD.)Lisel"
3,I love this movie so much but the version is poor,"I was so looking forward to receiving the special edition of ""Pride and Prejudice."" I have it on VHS and just love it. But the DVD is a huge disappointment. I don't know what was done, but the colors are nearly washed out. The outdoor scenes look as though they were very over-exposed, and the sound is terrible. I was just heartsick about it and returned the copy to Amazon."
3,Buy the UK Blu-ray for the full 327 min version,"Great show by BBC. I was addicted to this on TV and then jumped at the chance to buy it on DVD. Luckly for me, Australia got the full 327 minute version. Unfortunatey we have the US Blu-ray edition which is only 300 minutes. If you're a big fan, buy the UK edtion from amazon.co.uk for the lost 27 minutes."
1,Very outdated material,This book is very outdated in content and is of little use to present day hair loss sufferers. Don't waste the money on it like I did. You're better off reading a more thorough and accurate book. I personally found author Daniel Lawrence's new book on hair loss gave me the most up to date information on current treatments.
4,Darwin the Comedian,"Galapagos is Vonnegut near top form. As always he is the quintessential interdisciplinarian. For the historian we have contingency, for the scientist a hilarious and sophisticated explanation of natural selection that is a wonderful counterpoint to all forms of social darwinism, and for the political scientist we have another Vonnegut-puncturing of all forms of political posturing. A quick read, lampooning all the way."
4,A New Kind of Science Fiction,"This was an excellent look at evolutionary bottlenecks. Though the million-year-old ghost as observer is a bit of a deus ex machina, the rest of the work shows very clearly the adaptation to a changing environment by a particular animal, namely Homo sapiens. Is an advanced brain truly an evolutionary advantage? It causes the extinction of an entire species- us. The initial cause of mass infertility through parasitism also raises interesting questions on the nature of parasitism itself, as the parasite destroys it's host. This short work was recommended by my Marine Invert prof in undergrad for a fictional and accurate understanding of the inward nature of evolution. Vonnegut truly captures the philosophy behind the theory and not only the facts. A new kind of science fiction- fiction which helps us understand science better."
3,SCARY HA HA,"As to this story by Vonnegut, titled GALAPAGOS, one is naturally inclined toward charity when reading an author who has spent sixty years of his life to entertain readers. That said, having the ghost as a narrator was neither scary nor funny. The interrupting quotations belched from the black box, Mandarax, were pretentious and of course interrupted the flow of the story. This story shows the his inclination to use gimmicks to establish a new genre which might be called science satire. One must be fully prepared to suspend disbelief when being told of a blue tunnel to the afterlife that is pursuing the narrator ghost, son of the now tiresome Kilgore Trout. To pen a narrator who has no part in the action and no motive for telling the story beyond curiosity is a continuous distraction to the story -- and not at all what the author intended. The ghost was really composed of Vonnegut's haunting memories of Vietnam, another distraction."
2,Not at his best,"Galapagos! What a disaster that was. To tell the truth this is my least favorite Kurt Vonecut book. It just isn't like his normal witty self. The book is almost serious. Although the story is gripping and addictive, the story drags too much on simple things. It is as far from ""The Sirens of Titan"" or ""Breakfast of Champions"" as possible. Definately not one of his best. My advice is: Put down Galapogos and go but ""The Sirens of Titan""."
2,Not one of my favorites from Vonnegut,"I didn't find this book insightful, interesting, or very entertaining. It moves very slowly and doesn't really go anywhere which probably inhibits Vonnegut from really conveying his messages. I recently read Cat's Cradle, Jailbird, and Bluebeard and all were much better. Maybe I've overdosed on Vonnegut over the past few weeks, but I really shouldn't have to try hard to enjoy a book."
4,Odd tale,"Very typical of Kurt Vonnegut, this book goes back and forth between time and people. Somehow he manages to tie it kind of together in the end. Out of the box version of evolution."
5,My Introduction to Vonnegut,"Many people argue which is the best Vonnegut. For me it has to be 'Galapagos,' because it's the first one of his I ever read.I was blown away by the way Vonnegut wrote, and after reading this book, I went on to read about ten of his other books, loving them all. While I feel like 'Sirens of Titan' may be one of my favorites due to my love for sci-fi, Galapagos will always have a place in my heart for introducing me to my favorite author of all time.I've now read this book three times, and enjoy it more every time I read it. While many people might recommend 'Cats Cradle' or 'Slaughterhouse Five' as the best introductions to Vonnegut, for me, Galapagos is where all should begin."
2,Not his best book,"Galapagos is an interesting book delving into the genre of utopia prediction as only the cynical Kurt Vonegut can. His view of the future of the world is bleak and poignant, but this book, written in 1985, is no where near as funny as some of his previous works. Galapagos seems a bit drawn out and laborious, rehashing old themes that even in the 80's were probably not as pertinent as they could have been. It kept my interest because of the frequent references to the wildlife of the Galapagos islands, and not becuase of the supberb writing I have come to expect from Vonegut. If this is your first Vonegut book to read, then I pity you. Perhaps you would do better to read Slaughter House Five or Breakfast of Champions."
1,Did not finish,"This is the only Vonnegut book I did not finish reading. I have read Slaughter house 5, cat's cradle, player piano, sirens of titan, and breakfast of champions and I thought they were all excellent books."
4,Great cover,"I'm sure anyone picking up this book will agree that it has a great cover: green and black, with a pinch of yellow for good measure, and a few words to top it all off. I really like how he decided to have his name on it, too. I wouldn't have known it was a Vonnegut novel if it hadn't.That Vonnegut is a genius."
3,not as good as Cat'sCradle and Bluebeard but still worthwhil,"This is not as good as Bluebeard and some other Vonnegut novels (I think Cat's Cradle is by far the best), but it's an entertaining enough read that I would recommend it.It tells the story of the end of humanity as we know it and of our descendants one million years from now (1986 was the year it was written and in which it takes place) who have escaped the perils of our big brains and who now, not unlike seals, swim the ocean surrounding a small island in the Galápagos chain in search of fish.If you like KV's sense of humor and you don't mind a bit of sarcasm and negativity, you might enjoy this."
4,Brilliant,"This is one of those books that really makes you think. It asks the question of what it really means to be human. Is it better to accept the bad with the good, or to do away with both and live in contented ignorance? In his own twisted fashion, Vonnegut makes you realize all that is worth saving in this world."
3,My first Vonnegut experience,"This was the first Vonnegut book I've ever read.The story is told from a very strangle angle, which sort of releases bits of plot information in passing, slowly, like pieces of a puzzle until the whole picture comes into focus. I must admit, for the first 150 pages or so, I couldn't stand this style. It just seemed very unnatural and awkward.However, Vonnegut's biting social commentary and obvious metaphors were like nuggets of gold sprinkled throughout.When the story was complete, I was impressed by his ability to construct it in such a complex manner. The ending left a bit to be desired and seemed disorganized.3/5, but I will certainly read more Vonnegut books from this point forward."
2,not my favorite,It was a challenge to stay interested. the first two thirds of the book were all over the place. one chapter he would build on characters/plot and the next he would talk about something completely irrelevant to the story. i've read many of his other books and they all were amazing. this one didn't feel like a story to me.
4,Galapagos,"Whew, way out there! But what do you expect from Vonnegut? Traveling there early next year ('09); and thought I could get a few tips about the terrain. Fugetaboutit! Just amusing crazy humanity futurisms that happen to take place there...a real page turner and most amusing."
3,"A ""Typical"" Vonnegut Experience","I don't mean that in a bad way. This book is very typical of Kurt and his craft. It is very similar to the 12 other books by him that I have read in pace and patterns. But like Slapstick, his look at the future did not enthrall me. Also I am not an environmentalist so the overall theme of the book ""Humans will destroy the Earth if we don't do something"" didn't touch me. The only character in the book who is compelling is the headless son of Kilgore Trout. His roll is the events is so passive that you can't ""root"" for him. And there was no one else in the book to grab my attention. All in all it was written well and read quick, like all his previous books, but there was nothing in it that jumped out and begged for attention. Thanx for your time: T"
3,ENTERTAINING BUT NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"This being my first Vonnegut novel, I was hoping for something extraordinary. Needless to say I was amused but somewhat let down. The premise is attractive: Mankind is coming to end and fate leaves the future of humanity in the hands of an unexpecting lot of survivors. Who they are and how they get on the island is a mildly amusing tale. Vonnegut firmly confirmed his witty reputation as I read this novel. His thinnly veiled narrator sarcastically comments on all aspects of life from government to religion to basic human nature.The moral of the tale is that our big brains have began to combat Darwin's concept of evolution and that nature will someday remedy this in a big way.Overall the book was a quick read. Vonnegut's humor made it worth finishing, but I hope in the future to read a Vonnegut novel with a meatier plot too match the witty observations."
3,a fun misreading or Charles Darwin,"What a great concept...our big brains are our downfall, the one problem that evolution will ultimately alleviate. I agree that this is not Vonnegut's most rewarding book, but it is certainly the most thought provoking and the most fun to talk about. The idea of human beings, millions of years into the future, as having evolved into otter-like mamals who eat seaweed and lay in the sun to cook it within their stomachs strikes me as very funny. I've always loved Vonnegut. I read all the books at 13, when they were cool just for the cynicism and swear words and later in my twenties when I found them provacative and oddly touching. For later period Vonnegut, this is definitely a highlight though, a lot of plot, rather than just a forum for him to be a wise-(guy)."
3,Far from my favourite Vonnegut.,"Having read Slaughterhouse 5, Slapstick, Breakfast of Champions, Player Piano, Mother Night and ""Wampeters, Foma and Granfalloons"" (hope I got the last title right), I was itching to get stuck into this one. Unfortunately, I found it repetitive, slow and lacking the depth of character, plot and imagination demonstrated in many of his other works. I'm not saying it wasn't a good(ish) book, but I found it far from being his best. I'm surprised to see the variance in ratings given by other KV fans - I simply can't imagine giving this book five stars, let alone suggesting it's the best book I've ever read."
3,"Vonnegut's world view still cuts, but it's quickly dulling","Celebrated by some, ""Galapagos"" is in fact one of the most annoying books Vonnegut ever published. Outside of an interesting time with the ghost of Kilgore Trout, Vonnegut bores us with more island revolution, (ala ""Cat's Cradle"") and a conceited de-evolution theme about humans digressing over a million years into seals. A tremendous letdown which suggests that Vonnegut needs to look for something, ANYTHING that doesn't have to do with ""man is bad, andhe'll suffer for it, by God."" He's said it all before, and a whole lot better than this"
3,a little odd....,"it's very well written, and pretty interestingbut it is an odd ploti liked it, but i wouldn't read it twice"
1,One of my least favorite reads.....,"I was forced to read this book recently for a humanities honors level course in high school. I found Vonnegut's work to be an incredibly difficult read. He pays little attention to speed and character development, and his metaphors (I will bring up the ""when the rocket that french kissed the radar dish"" one) did not provide a clear image in my head as to what he had intended. I did think that his ideas were largely valid and that he had interesting points, yet he seemed so antagonistic toward humans and made all of his characters unlikeable, with features that became exaggerated to the point of being unreal. If you like abstract work of an unorthodox writing style, this book may not bother you, but otherwise I would not recommend it. I ended the book feeling like I had wasted a great deal of time and learned nothing, on top of being frustrated with Vonnegut's writing style and characters."
3,"""middle of the menu"" Vonnegut","Well, I'm a big fan of Vonnegut's, especially his earlier stuff, but by the time this one came out I was no longer devouring his new works immediately upon publication. I recently took a wonderful trip to the Galapagos Islands, though, and a friend told me this book was a must-read.The main theme of Galapagos is that humans evolving a big brain did not turn out to be such a good evolutionary strategy. Clever (and dark) enough, but only marginally sufficient to sustain a full-length book.Oh, it reads very easily, and it's undeniably Vonnegut, so I didn't have a bad time reading it, certainly. But, Sirens of Titan it ain't.This is for the confirmed Vonnegut fan who's probably going to wind up reading pretty much all of his stuff eventually anyway. For most everybody else, there's probably a dozen better choices to read first."
2,"Good for what it covers; unfortunately, doesn't cover much","I considered a three-star rating, but just can't do it. A National Geographic or Peterson guide will do you better.I mean, how can you omit the entire Heron genus from the book?Plus, due to a printing problem which I didn't realize until a couple of days after I bought this book in a National Park, it was missing several pages of color plates."
3,Good comedy,"A good comedy with great comedians(Wilder,Pryor) and the presence of the voloptous Joan Severance in a good role(one of the murders) with good dialogs and gags.A good entertainment."
1,VHS,I thought I was ordering a dvd to replace the vhs tape I allready had. So I was dissappointed. The condition seemed to be ok.
3,The last effort that sank like a stone,"Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor were one of the funniest duos in history. They played off each other's neuroses, shortcomings and antics so well. This movie has its moments, but alas, it was dampened by a weak plot and a premise too silly to be believed.Gene is deaf, Richard is blind. Much of that material of mishap writes itself. Richard's health was clearly deteriorating and it shows by his weight lose and lack of energy, now he's so crippled by MS he can't even talk. Gene is funny and lovable as ever, but you wonder if he's having as much fun as he's supposed to because of Richard's off camera antics. That one scene where he clearly had a hard on for that gal was pretty funny, and there are a few good one liners and scenes here and there, but it's a weak story with a dull ending. This would be the last time they would team up together, and for obvious reasons they didn't want to go back."
5,Hilarious!,This was the funniest movie I have seen in a long time. I highly recommend it to everyone. Whether your a Pryor or Wilder fan you'll love it. There is a great deal of swearing but it adds to the characters themselves. This is a must see!
4,Love any Pryor/Wilder movie,Great combination of comics. Joan Severance is a beauty and Kevin Spacey is a surprise. Also a good plot for the interaction of the characters.
5,speak no evil!,"Gene Wilder has always been one of my favorites and this movie is great. Be careful, there is some language, but the premise has never been used even today. Love it! Want to laugh all the time while watching it."
4,"Hear no evil, See no evil","Super! Always did like this movie--enjoyed by my grandkids, too. However, should have ordered full-screen DVD. My fault that I didn't."
5,Great comedy,"Laughed all the way to the end. If you want to chuckle for an hour or so, this is your movie."
5,One of Wilder and Pryor's best!,"I saw this movie when it was in the theater in 1989. I liked it so much that I had to buy it on VHS. Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor star as two innocent guys-one deaf, one blind, and both are on the run for a murder they didn't commit! Add the wonderful talents of Joan Severance and Kevin Spacey, and you have the makings of one well scripted and very funny movie! Oh, and let's not forget Alan North as the police chief. The film's plot makes for a cops and robbers type of suspense. Of all of Gene Wilder's and Richard Pryor's works, ""See No Evil, Hear No Evil"" is as equally funny as ""Silver Streak"", which makes it a must buy!"
4,Mamma Mia!,"Look no further than Sam Butera to hear how Louis Prima put the cool in songs like ""Jump Jive An'Wail"" and ""Just A Gigolo/I Ain't Got Nobody"". Butera's solo stuff is just as much fun thanks to great, wild saxophones, thumping drums and fun-time lyrics. This set covers that side of him and the slow, romantic, candle-light & wine ballads as well. If you've got Louis Prima's Capitol Collectors Series set, then you'll know how important Butera was. It's great to see this anthology: it serves up great music that's been absent from store shelves for decades! Enjoy!"
3,Something is missing here....,"and that something would be Louis Prima,and Keeley Smith...Sure,Sam Butera was Prima's back-up man during the latter's prime,but listening to Butera alone is sort of like listening to the E-Street Band with out Bruce Springsteen..."
4,Generic Canon Faxphone Ink Cartridge,"I was pleased that the product was entirely the equivalent of the brand-name cartridge. I was less pleased with delivery, which occurred at the very end of the projected delivery range. Otherwise it would have been a five-star review."
5,"Got ""detoured"" and had a good time","I purchased Richard La Plante's other book, ""Hog Wild"" after reading this book, and this book is a much better read. Chapter after chapter of a rider's diary on the road. Not too many backflash memories, but what is mentioned, seems to flow well with the moment in the roadtrip.I recommend this book for ""off-season"" riders, or anyone who wishes they could travel the roadways via motorcycle. You can almost feel the wind as you read."
2,Just so-so,"This poster was meant to hang in the kitchen and remind us to eat a variety of foods to meet our nutritional needs. Unfortunately, the foods shown for each vitamin/mineral are limited choices. Geared for vegetarians, the choices don't include many common choices that vegetarians utilize. :( I'd pass on this one."
5,Very informative,This book is packed with dozens of creative real estate ideas. It reads like a cook book and makes buying real estate with little or no money down as easy as baking a cake.
5,Sweet Dreams is Right,"Love this product. My work shift begins at 4am as I work full time and am also a full time student, so getting to sleep early is a requirement for me to be successful. Some nights I go to sleep before the sun sets. I don't know how I'd manage those nights without this sleep mask. It's very comfortable, does not obstruct your blinking at all, and doesn't get ""hot"" -- the material remains cool. There is a small area near the bridge of the nose where light can be seen if your eyes are open, but closed, you don't even notice it, unlike with some other products I've used."
4,Good value,Good value for the price. Mask is soft and works quite well. Nose area is the only part that is slightly uncomfortable. More room needed. But otherwise works great.
5,sleeping on the plane to England,"This is exactly what I needed to sleep on the flight from Atlanta to Gatwick. Don't watch the movies, put in the ear plugs and strap on the mask. Then sleep. I was able to beat jet lag almost 100%!"
4,Niiiiiice,"Light weight and cool to wear. Seals out the light better than most, and its good if having something right up against your eyelids bothers you - you can even blink unobstructedly if ya want. Still, my eye sockets are very hard to seal and its not as good as my tempurpedic which molds better to my steep socket/nose curves. Tempurpedic however is very bulky, which not only makes travel less convenient but also makes it less comfortable when pressure from pillow. I use this one for travel and tempurpedic at home."
4,Nice Contour,"I believe that the nose area could have been more fitted, but i love how this completely blocks out all light"
5,This is a wonderful item,This is a wonderful item. Naptime has been a dream. I put the mask on and I forget that it's on. I actually bought a smaller version of this item for my mother. Thank you so much.
2,Irritated My Skin,"I initially liked this mask. I loved the price. However after a month or so, I found that it irritated my skin to the point that I could not use it. I do not consider my skin sensitive. The mask is effective in keeping the light out."
2,Choked my nose and also little uncomfortable on ears & back of the head too..,"I was very excited to get these as the reviews were great & it looked very cool. But the first night I tried and it seemed a failure. It's nice to have eye movement & it does it every well. Very dark inside too. Except the light that comes at bottom and chokes the nose. It's definitely not for all nose sizes, definitely not mine. Although I do have a regular beautiful nose. Also felt lil rough on ears & bumpy at the back of the head at the velcro. I have to say, I am very-very disappointed."
1,Falls apart after 3 months!,"The layers of fabric material aren't sewn together, they're just glued, and this thing fell apart after just 3 months of use. Stay away, cheap product!"
2,not worth the buy,"i bought this sleep mast thinking that it will be nice and comfy but its not the case, the plastic band has a uncomfy feel to it and when you sleep on your side it doesn't fit right i guess its made only to use laying on your back.it does block out (SOME) light but if u look down to your noise you can see that light gets in and that is annoying if your lying down cause u keep seeing light which is clearly the reason i bought it for in the first place ( to keep light out) which it doesn't do a good job at doing. simply if u want to have complete darkness to go sleep in a area that has light this wont work buy something else."
2,Couldn't breathe!,"I painstakingly read the reviews about this sleep mask, and finally (!) ordered this one. To my disappointment, I returned it the next day. Why? Because the nose guard was too tight, making me feel like I couldn't breathe. I will take a slightly light-filled room over feeling like I'm suffocating any day. Also, the velco closure in the back is bulky, and it felt uncomfortable if I laid on my back. Better luck next time!"
3,Works. But cheaply made.,"You could get a similar mask on Ebay for 3 bucks. Quality is about the same. It works. For 9 bucks, the quality could use some improvement"
4,Great for the price,Does exactly what's wanted - blocks out all the light and eyelashes dont scrape or get caught on the mask.
4,Makes things dark!,"The mask works well, probably really well for back sleepers, but I have a tendency to be more of a side sleeper which causes the mask to bulge off my face allowing more light in and becoming a bit uncomfortable. If I could sleep on my back all night, I would give 5 stars."
2,sleep mask does not fit well,"I bought this sleep mask because of the light that comes into our bedroom as a result of a street light. Unfortunately, it is not as nice as I expected it to be. First, the space available for your nose is incredibly small. Only young children would have a nose that fits in there. As a result, light seeps in from underneath my eyes. Only when I press down on the bottom part of the mask does the light stop coming in. Also, the sides of the mask, where the strap is attached, are pretty hard. Sometimes they hurt the side of my face so I feel forced to take it off. All in all, I would not recommend this mask."
2,The nose spoils it,"This is a well made sleep mask, and the materials are quite comfortable. The thing that spoils it for me is the contoured nose. I'm a 5'6"" guy and I have an average sized nose, what I found is the contoured nose part lifted the bottom of the mask so it wasn't flush with my face, letting light in. It also restricted breathing through my nose, which was the real problem. Because of that I can't use it at all.I'm going to try cutting the nose piece out to see if it works better, which would make it much like the excellent performing but not well made Bucky 40 Blinks."
3,"great at blocking light, poor at staying whole","Comfortable, snug fit around my nose that blocks all light. Also doesn't press on my eyes, so I don't wake up bleary-eyed like I've been pressing my hands against my eyes for hours.Sadly, the fabric of the mask has started separating after only a short time.I managed to keep it in place by stitching the fabric at the edges, but that should be done by the manufacturer, not by the consumer."
3,Held up long enough,"I bought this sleep mask for my European vacation, as I am a light sleeper. It did the job pretty well (total blackout) and was comfortable; but after about a month of use, the soft lining started to separate from the foam core, and was totally separated after 6 weeks."
4,"The best, but may not last forever","This is the only eye mask that is actually comfortable wear during business travel. I knocked off one star in the rating only because the material is soft and comfortable, but I don't know how durable it will be for the next few years (if it's being folded and smooshed in a carry on airline bag). Still, at this price, I can buy another when it wears out."
4,Most comfy sleep mask EVER!!!,"This mask is nicely padded, very comfortable, and keeps it's shape really well. The only down side for me is the velcro closure on the back of the head. I love that it's adjustable but the velcro usually gets snagged in my hair."
4,Great Product. No complaints.,"Great Product and no complaints.It is comfortable, yet durable enough to last through daily use without the elastic weakening."
4,Best Price,"I really hate light when I sleep, so I bought a few masks on Amazon to see which was the best. Basically what I got was exactly the same from all the different places I ordered from. This company was not only the least expensive, but they also included ear plugs and a nice little carrying pouch with the mask.So if you are debating which mask to buy, just go with this one since the masks were all the same and this one was cheaper and came with that nice pouch and ear plugs."
3,"Nice, but looks odd","Bought this for travel - my husband says it looks like a bra and won't use it. Also bought the Bucky Eyeshades and the Escape Luxury Sleep Mask and he likes them both much better. On the good side, it is light and comfortable."
2,Overpriced for a throw-away,"Out of the package it is a near perfect sleep mask. Exceptionally comfortable and blocks light except for a little bit around the nose area.Sadly, it is not washable or long lasting. OK, you could wash it but it will just fall apart more quickly. Less than three months passed before the fabric started separating away from the foam core. Now, it is useless.Too bad the mfg doesn't do something to hold the layers together because it is otherwise wonderfully lightweight, effective and comfortable. Decent price if it lasted a full year. For a throwaway however, it is overpriced."
1,Uncomfortable sleep mask,"The mask arrived on time, undamaged and clean. I tried to wear it a few times but it was just too uncomfortable to sleep with it on."
2,uncomfortable,"The masked blocked out light pretty well, but the fit was uncomfortable. It doesn't work for side or stomach sleepers. It probably would work OK for back sleepers. I also found the ear plugs were flimsy and didn't work well."
4,Batman sleeps all night!,"I chose these because they did not touch my eyes. That works fine. But when I peeked in the mirror, I saw Batman. I hope the flight attendants on my next trip are the good guys."
5,Sleep well,"My Aunt was in a extended care facility after surgery. Usually they are 2 patients to a romm, so sleep is precious. My Aunt slept well with the blinders and ear plugs. Great price and also comes with a carry pouch."
3,"Good mask, but only for certain faces.","This mask is comfortable and has a lot of room for your eyes to open and close comfortably should you choose to do so. I haven't worn it so much that it's worn out as the other reviews said it does, so I can not comment on that, but I have found one significant problem: The mask is contoured to fit your face quite nicely if your face happens to fit the mold of the mask. If not, it will naturally fit wrong. In my case the bridge of my nose is not a smooth gentle slope, but rather has an arch or cliff to it. It's not all that big, nonetheless it causes the mask to ""float"" above my cheeks at the bottom. This lets light in making the mask a failure in it's primary objective. Though this is with my face. With yours the story may be different."
1,unusable,"if you lie sideways, the bulky construction of it disturbs you. also because of it touching the pillow, gaps opens and light leaks inside. if you lie on your back, now the rough velcro fastened belt is disturbing back of your head. don't even think about sleeping on your chest"
1,Some Pros and Cons...,"Pros:hmmm... better move on to cons.Cons:- Elastic strap placed too low and cuts into ears.- Mask contours blocks just enough light from the bottom to make these worthless.- Raised contours don't cover eyes, so mask presses on eyes anyway.- By the time I wake up, the mask has made its way to my forehead, regardless of how tight it was.- Flimsy lightweight material.If these cost more than 50 cents a pop to mass produce, these sellers are being ripped off.-- The guy who apparently has a very strange head shape and sense of quality given all the other positive reviews, but seems to be doing fine with the sleep mask he got at wal-mart... Please note my newfound skepticism and suspicion of every other positive review."
3,Grammar check,"Whoever wrote the product description and features might want to have the grammar checked. For me, this level of error diminishes my impression of the product's quality."
5,amazing. rotfl!,"These are great. I got them for my wife, because I told her sleeping with fresh orange slices on her eyes would help with her kidney stones (It's little practical joke I've been playing on her. You and I both know orange peels on the eyelids is a preopsterous idea, but I've got her doing it every night for the past 7 years and it's hilarious. Shhhh! don't spoil the joke)Aaaaanyway...this little number holds the citrus slices on her eyes perfectly, all night long, no slipping or sliding or juice on my pillow. Highly recommended. A+++++!"
1,the website is charging 54.00 for a 7.95 item,"Hi: i ordered an idem for for 7.95 for a sweet dreams sleep mask and when i went to check out they charged me 54.00 what a rip off,look at your check out price they will charge you what they can"
2,no no no no,doesnt keep out enough light and the worst part is that the strap that goes over and to the back of your head hurts. It wouldnt be a problem if i slept on my side the whole time but this product has terrible design flaws
4,"Good mask, simple adjustment makes it really good","This mask is pretty good out of the box, but for me at least there was a small amount of light leaking in around the nose. I took an average size paper clip, straightened it out and inserted it between the neoprene and fabric cover along the bottom edge of the mask so that it formed a partial wire frame along bottom edge of nose piece, extending slightly to both sides of the nose. (Took about 10 minutes) I was then able to contour the mask a little better so that the light was completely blocked. To test the mask, I put the mask on and closed my eyes, while someone else turned this really big light right above my bed off and on without me knowing where they stopped. I was not able to tell whether the light was on or not with the mask/wire frame combo--success.(I suppose I should add the obligatory warning that this modification is not safety tested--it is possible this could be a bad idea for some reason.)"
3,It works but it doesn't stay on securely,I like the sleep mask because it helps me sleep better but it won't stay on my head the whole time while i sleep. They need to make the band a little bit tighter so that it can snuggle around the head better. Otherwise it is a pretty good product
5,cool-wearing sleep mask,"This is my favorite sleep mask. I also own another (see my other reviews). The other mask may block a tiny bit more light near the nose, but this one can be lowered to do nearly as well and it is so lightweight that my face doesn't notice it as much. There is a coolness to its thinner fabric which I prefer and hence I use it occasionally now at home since I've returned from my big trip to Europe. The cost is not excessive, it blocks light well (I suppose you'd have to adjust it against a slit of light near the lower end if you wore it in broad daylight) and the comfort is high. Personally, I don't wear a mask in broad daylight. Ha! We do have an annoying streetlight outside our window, though, and on warm nights with the room-darkening shades up a bit for fresh air, this mask performs well."
2,not for me!,"Well, I believed in the positive reviews and sadly this eye mask wasnt that good for me, it feels kinda rough so for that matter it moves akwardly when I sleep on my side. The nose part moves. The velcro thing in the back you can feel it when sleepin on your back...the strap hurts the top of my ears.. so I couldnt fall asleep with that feeling... so is not comfy at all... not nice padding feeling like I thought it would have so is basically kinda rough and nah!!!!.. Ive had better ones that are like 3 dlls and padded... sadly :/ Ill go back to the regular ones then.. thanks. Hope this review help somebody else. Oh and the earplugs, they didnt really work that well either... :/"
3,"Light comes through, mask slides a bit","This item seems well-made, yet as others state, light comes through the nose-piece unless your nose is exactly the size of the nose-piece. The mask also slides around on my head a little bit (I have VERY short hair). I got one for my mom, and she did not like the size of the elastic and the velcro closure saying they are too thick. We have decided to keep these in our guest rooms."
5,Great for travel,The contour helps prevent the mask from pushing on your eyes during use. It folds up and is very compact. It's comfortable enough and does a great job of blocking out light. Recommended for travel purposes.
4,Best sleep I've had with minor improvements,"This item is a godsend! My boyfriend and I are on opposite schedules so we both bought a pair and our sleep has NEVER BEEN BETTER. My only problem with this mask is that after a few weeks of wearing it every night, the fabric starts to separate and you have stitch it back together or it will continue to fall off and fray. It was a small price to pay for having fantastic sleep, but if you want to avoid that, use a needle and thread to whip stitch around the perimeter and eliminate this problem early."
2,Do not waste your money,The sleep mask is nothing special. It has a cheap elastic band that is too small. It lets light in around the nose and lower eyes. Very disapointed.
2,Too large and doesn't fit tightly enough,"This is too large for both my face and my wife's. The molded nose area lets in light and because the mask is so large, the contoured eye areas aren't centered directly above my eyes. The material that the mask is made out of isn't especially soft. Microfiber masks feel much nicer. This mask's achilles heel, however, is the fact that it WILL NOT stay on at all while I sleep. In fact, simply twitching the muscles in my face a certain way is enough to make it work itself off.Perhaps Shaquille O'Neal loves this mask, but it's too large and too flawed for me."
2,Still lets light through,"I ordered these hoping that I'd find a pair that provided total blocking of the light.However, I'm not sure who they used to model these. Do not provide complete blockage.The nose ridge still allows light to come in. I had intended to use these for mymeditations. The earplugs are nice though. But looks like I'll have to send backthe eyemask. It also pushes on the back of the head, and I can imagine that there areother pairs out there that are a bit more comfortable."
4,Almost 5 stars!,"I first bought this mask back in January 2008 and up until recently it's been great. About a month ago, the lining began pulling away from the inside of the mask and a few weeks later was completely separate from the interior foam. But, I like it so much I went ahead and bought it again! $9.00 every 3 and a half years isn't bad."
3,"Good on eyes, bad on head.","Cons:-Velcro connector- If you have sensitive fabric, these straps will probably shred them up.-A little tight on the head. I don't have a big head, but the elastic straps kind of make it uncomfortable. Especially around ears.Pros:-The contour over the eyes makes it more comfortable to sleep with-Effectively blocks out light by creating a ""shell"" of darknessReason for Purchase:I am a bartender, and I got these because I sleep more during the day than I do at night.Bottom Line:If you don't mind a slight discomfort around the ears, then these will work great for you."
3,Okay,"I bought this mask for my husband to help him sleep during the day when he works night shift. It works well as for keeping out the light, etc., and he does wear it. However, it slides off his face while he is sleeping because there is only so much you can tighten it to fit. Also, the velcro fastener in the back is not comfortable to lay on while he is sleeping."
3,An OK Product,"The mask is comfortable and true to the product description your eyes don't feel a thing. It also has a velcro in the back of the strap which must be so that it can separate without choking you, because the velcro is too small for size adjustments.My major quibble with the mask is that it leaks in a lot of light around the nose area because of the contours. There is undoubtedly someone out there that this mask would fit and it would be a fantastic product for that single person. Unfortunately, that person is not me, nor is it my girlfriend."
4,"Works well, in spite of the funny appearance","This is the best eye mask ever. It's comfortable (notice the cutout for the nose) and designed so it doesn't feel restrictive. The eye cups are designed so they don't push against the eyeball. The strap doesn't snag hair and fits comfortably around the head and behind the ears. Blocks out plenty of light for daysleepers and nap times or for bedmates that leave the light on to read. Even though it looks somewhat like a bra, this product is excellent."
2,ok for what it costs,"This mask is basically a bra cup for each eye.I didn't realize this before i bought it.Feels kinda annoying with it .I only had it one day but couldn't use it.I will stick this mask in my camping bag and use it then ,when im drunk and it won't realy matter about comfort.It's not a bad mask if you don't mind the contour shape,i prefer a flat mask."
5,Comfortable on the eyes and head,"Great for day sleepers! I work nights and if my wife needs to do stuff in the room, these (along with ear plugs) allows her to do so. Keeps light out. This mask really allows you to get a good days sleep as they allow your eyes to open without touching the mask and the velcro size adjustment doesn't create bump on the band that will bother you. My son was always borrowing mine, so I got him his own. He loves them too!"
3,seem to work,They aren't as padded to block out light. They do work but depending on your face the nose cheekbone area may allow light in.
5,Perfect,"I work night and unfortunately the sun shines right into my bedroom during the late morning into early afternoon. I had been using another face mask, but light was getting in so I needed someone more structured. I have not used the earplugs-I have no need for them. The mask blocks out all light and I now have to set my alarm because without the light to wake me up I just keep sleeping! The mask is comfortable to wear and stays in place."
1,Don't buy this one!,This eye mask quickly fell apart on the mask part. It is now in the landfill and I will never buy this one again. I recommend the Sleep Pretty In Pink Women's Sleep Mask.
1,disappointed,"The product is as advertised and very comfortable. However, the mask is made of three layers bonded together. After only eight months the layers separated and the sleep mask is now difficult to wear. I'm disappointed."
2,If you have a big head?,"Don't get this sleep mask. My head is pretty big (24.5 inches) and no matter what I do I still see light under the mask. I've gone back to my flax seed, lavender scented, sleep pillow. I haven't tried the ear plugs as I don't need them at the moment."
1,smells bad,"The shape of this is easy on the eyes, but the smell is awful - definitely not something you want to breathe very long. We tried airing it out and washing it to see if the smell would dissipate, but it's still toxic, and we've gone past the deadline to return it. What were they thinking when they chose such awful materials for something you wear near your nose?"
5,Better than the other ones I've tried,"I bought a couple different eye masks and tried it out against the one we already had along w/my fiancee. We both agreed that the ""Dream Essentials"" was way better than the ""Sleep Master"" for a few reasons.(1) Effectiveness - the Dream Essentials seemed like it fit both of our heads way better. I have a large head, she has a small head. The Sleep Master is basically just a padded soft blue thing to wrap around your head with a really small nose slit cut out of it. You could make one yourself at home.(2) Eye pockets are cut out in the Dream Essentials. My fiancee doesn't have to worry about her lashes. For me, it just feels better.. it feels like you are in a dark room vs. having something covering your eyes.. you can open your eyes and look around(3) Price. The especially disappointing thing about the ""Sleep Master"" is that it is DEFINITELY not worth whatever they charged us (I think it was $20). The Dream Essentials was less than $10 and got the job done."
2,Looks Like a Bat Man Mask,This product does the job of blocking the light and protecting your eyes at night also soft to the touch. The bonus is the carrying case and the ear plus if you need them its worth it. It lasted about 6 month and then came apart unglued itself
3,Expected to be better,"It has a velcro on the back right in the middle, you feel it if your head is not turned. Also, I can still see the light, there is still an opening around a nose. And no, I don't have a huge nose, it is an average size. However, it's better than nothing."
4,Very Comfy,"Better than any other sleep mask on the market. Shaped to the face so it doesn't put pressure on the bridge of your nose. Prevents eyes from getting itchy since they also aren't being pressed in by the mask. Strap adjusts enough for male heads (many other sleep masks are too small for men.) I had bought 4 other sleep masks for travel, they are all garbage now :)"
5,Really liked this product,"I took this sleep mask on several long-haul flights and found it quite comfortable and light on my face. I also like the convenient pouch. Although the mask is somewhat large on my face, I still liked the product and would buy again."
5,Best Ever!,"Cheap and very comfortable. Been using for a week and I have zero complaints. There is velcro in the back, but it doesnt bother me because I don't sleep on my back."
2,Not Durable,Comfortable and provides good peripheral coverage. Unworthy due to poor assembly. Mask layers began peeling after 1 month of very occasional use.
2,Coming part after 1 month.,"Disappointed in the quality of the mask. It has already started to come apart around the nose and about the nose.About the productIt does block MOST of the light, not all. Some those creep around the nose, not too bad though.Comfortable"
3,Lightweight mask,"I've written reviews on many of these masks (read all my reviews to find them.) This one is good if you want something small and lightweight. It doesn't do a good job of sealing out light, however. I improved mine by making a scissors cut halfway up the nose. This allowed the mask to separate a little and settle down onto my face, blocking out more light.Incidentally, the 'Sweet Dreams' and 'Lights Out' masks are the same. Pick the cheaper of the two."
3,"Some issues, but okay","This mask is generally effective, but quite uncomfortable. The nose contour doesn't fit correctly, put a lot of pressure on my nose, and makes the mask ride up. Also, the strap on the back of the mask is fairly thick, so it is uncomfortable to put the strap behind one's ears. The mask blocks a decent amount of light when it is on perfectly, but if it slips at all a lot of light gets in."
2,Leaky,"Overall fit of the sleepmask is good but there is no way toseal it completely around the nose. If you're using it in aroom that's already slightly dark, its okay. It just doesn'tseal tight enough to use in a lighted room.YMMV"
1,"Doesn't stay on, Isn't comfortable, Doesn't shut out light!","Don't recommend whatsoever. Basically, the title of this review says it all. Go to the Walmart Travel Section, there's a $5 gray sleep mask with memory foam that works PERFECTLY! Don't waste your money on this product."
4,omg the best,"I love this mask. im the type to sleep in the dark with no lights. but having a spouse and different sleeping times its hard to sleep. i bought this mask and when i tell you, it knocks me out. it forces you to go to sleep, i love it. i dont want to keep it tight on my head because i dont want to be hurting when i wake up so it does sometimes slides to the side or up and down but never completly off my face."
4,Blackout mask,"Works great while it's on, mine usually comes off after a couple of hours or so. That's all I need it for though, I just don't want to wake up at the crack of dawn. If I was a full on day sleeper I'd need to figure out a way to make it say on longer. Very comfortable, does not press on eyes.Dream Essentials Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask with Earplugs and Travel Pouch ~ Black"
3,Decent Sleep Mask- Good for the Price,"I am very sensitive to light and bought this eye mask to help me sleep in my room, which is constantly lit up by street lights.Pros:Effective at blocking out light (the light from the nose bridge that some people have commented about was negligible).Contoured mask keeps pressure off eyes.Cons:Strap pushes down on ears, to the painful point of waking me up.Any time I sleep on my stomach or side, the eye 'bubbles' invert and put more pressure on my eyes than a non-contoured mask.The cons often outweigh the pros, since the pain or pressure wakes me up more than light would. Even when the mask doesn't wake me up, I often push off the mask at night, defeating the whole purpose. That said, I think this is a decent mask, especially for the price, and would work well for back sleepers or travelers who must sleep upright."
2,Time reveals a flaw...,"I bought this almost six months ago and was very happy with it for about three months. It blocks the light almost completely (a little creeps in on each side of my nose as I have a rather sharp nose -- if yours is not quite so sharp this mask will likely block the light completely), doesn't impede your eyelids/lashes during REM sleep, and is soft and lightweight. I would have easily given this product five stars if I would have rated it within the first three months of use.However, the bottom edge, particularly near the nose, has frayed revealing two layers of fabric surrounding one of foam. Also, the band has lost most of its elasticity and no longer holds the mask tightly enough against my face.It doesn't look like it's going to last much longer."
5,"Wonderful, comfortable eye shades for indoors","These were better than the Bucky eye shades I also purchased, with the exception if you are sleeping outside. The Bucky's did keep out more sun-light but indoors I couldn't tell a difference. For comfort and relaxation while sleeping indoors the Sweet Dreams was better. It was also much cheaper ($11.79 w/shipping to Bucky $31.34 w/shipping). I found the Bucky's still applied a little pressure on my eyes where the Sweet Dreams mask did not. The Sweet Dreams also stayed on better when I layed on my side."
2,Don't waste your money if you have a small face/nose!,"I have been buying the really cheap satin eye masks from the local drug store that just have the elastic to hold them in place. I should have stuck to those, because this mask is just not the right fit for my face. I think it could be good for someone with a larger face and/or nose. On me, though, if I pulled it down far enough to keep most of the light out, the elastic band would be over my ears, which was very uncomfortable. Plus, it was way far down on my nose, which kept causing me to wake up and push it up. It didn't stay in place well at all, and I gave up after three nights of trying to wear it."
3,"Good mask, but uncomfortable clasp","The sleep mask is comfortable and blocks out the light well. Major complaint is the Velcro clasp at the back of the mask. If you sleep on your back, the clasp (which is relatively thick) will be in between your head and the pillow, and can be quite uncomfortable (irritating to my head). I've taken to putting the mask on without the Velcro fastening, but that obviously means the mask falls off easily as I sleep."
4,Blocks out most of the light,"I, like many other people who are buying these, work nights and sleep during the day. This sleep mask blocks out most of the light, but some does get through near your nose. I ended up pairing this up with a ""Revolutionary, Patented SLEEP MASTER Sleep Mask"" and combined absolutely no light gets through.I use the dream essentials sleep mask underneath the sleep master and couldn't be happier."
2,LIGHT COMES IN,This item looks good from the pictures but when I recieved and tried it out thats another story.Light gets in around the nose area because the mask has no support.When you don this mask light appears at the bottum of mask around the nose and lower eyes.They need to design a way so that the lower portion of mask will remain against your face.Right now there is no support so there is always a gap.
3,Decent Sleep mask,"I like the contoured eye covers as they give plenty of room for the eyes to move during sleeping, but the band that holds the mask on comes right over my ears and is uncomfortable, so the way I wear it to make it more comfortable allows more light in around the nose area. Decent, but I'll probably try to find one that works better for me."
5,I wear it every night and if I nap during the day.,"This is a great eye mask if you're like me and need complete darkness to fall asleep. I put this on during the day if I need a quick nap and I also wear it at night. The eye mask stays put for the most part but it's understandable that it is going to move when I toss and turn a lot. As far as the extras go, I don't wear ear plugs but I guess if you do, it's a good option to have."
4,Worth the money,"The nose mold doesn't fit precisely. I'm sure it is molded for the generic nose but it does let light in. Other than that, the mask block 95% of the light and is extremely comfortable. Other masks lay flat against the eyes...I find this uncomfortable. This mask is contoured so no portion of the mask is in contact with the eye lids."
5,Very comfortable with no light leakage or irritation to your eyelashes,"Just got this mask and it is so comfortable, not rubbing up on my eyes like my old pair or feel rough to the skin. Definitely a good purchase and I would purchase two in case your first one wears out from lots of use, because you will love them. I can't believe anyone would give these negative review. I guess you can never please everyone. These sure had a good shot at it though."
3,"pretty good, but falls apart fairly quickly",This is comfortable and does a good job of blocking out the light. I used it frequently for a few months and the fabric is separating. I expect it will become unusable soon.
3,"Blocks light, Easy to wear, Falls apart!","These are fantastic; however, they are actually constructed of a piece of contoured foam covered with soft nylon. I am on my 2nd pair after several months. Both pair the inner nylon against your face starts to come away from the foam. I am buying them again; however, since they fall apart they cannot be rated more than 3*. If the inner nylon did not come away from the foam they would definitely be the best eye shade I have ever used."
2,Straps not long enough!,"This is a Very comfortable mask, HOWEVER maybe I just have a big head lol but the straps just barely fit around my head and sometimes the straps will come apart due to this. So for all those ""small head"" people, buy it. For all those woman with ""Elaine"" from Seinfeld heads: buyer beware! lol"
4,so glad I got this!,"This is the best sleep mask I have ever used. I work nights and usually get to bed between 5 am - 6 am (right when the sun is about to come up),and I am a very light sleeper. Any noise/light is a bother, however since I've been using this mask I have been sleeping so well. I really like how the eye sockets in the mask are more open than you find in the usual kinds of sleep masks, it lets you open your eyes without them being pushed down. The only reason I did not give this 5 starts is because there is a little light that comes through around the bottom of your nose, but it's very little."
4,Great... if it fits your face properly,"I guess I have a bigger nose than I thought. Whenever I read the reviews I thought the light leaking at the bottom wouldn't apply to me; Sadly, it does. It isn't a lot of light leaking, but it is just enough to annoy you. If you can manage to mold the mask a little bit more to fit your face, it's awesome. Super comfortable, doesn't smell (after you let it air out for a day), and well... it's a face mask - what else is there to say about it?"
4,Great eye mask,This is a great eye mask. It totally blocks out any and all light. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the ear plugs seem cheap and don't really work.
2,Maybe just me....,"I honestly wasn't satisfied with this product and don't even use it anymore. The strap that goes around you're head is extremely uncomfortable at where it meets at the back of you're head. Also light easily comes in where you're nose goes, and I have an average size nose....so I was unhappy with that too."
4,Good Night,"When I try to sleep at night, I need it to be absolutely dark. Unfortunately, I have a roommate that has a ton of technology that has a tendency to glow. At night, you could turn off all the lights in the room and there would be an soft glow of LED lights all around me. After I got the mask, I have been able to sleep so much better, the lights are completely blocked out and I can finally get some peace. The mask is very comfortable and fits snugly around my face.The only downside to this (as I'm sure with any other mask) is that I can't sleep on my side. It tends to get pushed into an uncomfortable position. I've learned to sleep on my back, but I would have preferred something that could accommodate other sleeping positions. Besides that, this is a great product!"
2,Almost perfect but,Problems with the straps as they cut into my ears.. if you make the strap a little looser in the back the hard plastic part of the velcro is exposed and will make noises on your pillow when moving around at night. I do not have a thin nose and light still creeps in on the side... also if you raise your eyebrows at all the mask will creep up higher and higher and let light in.. no bueno.. its going back..
5,On my second cover!,"My husband borrowed my cover on a vacation and left them at the hotel. These are the only eye covers that haven't stretched out on me. They work great. The first time I used these, the preformed nose felt a little awkward, but now I'm used to it and can't sleep without my eye cover."
2,several problems,"At first I was optimistic about this sleep mask. It seemed soft and comfortable enough. Once wearing it, it wasn't big enough for my head. The velcro in the back had to be at its lowest possible setting in order to be loose enough to be comfortable.The nose indention did not fit my face at all.Light went through because of this.After wearing it for the first 2 nights I had to return it. It wasn't working right. It came up off my face several times in the night, and I don't roll around or move in my sleep. It was uncomfortable around the ears.Didn't need the earplugs, was just a bonus which was nice, but the mask was just so bad that it didn't make a difference."
5,A relationship saver,"My girlfriend needs more sleep than I do. I like to stay up a little later and read on my android. Now I can read without bothering her, She especially likes the ""padded bra"" like eye covers because they block the light without resting on her eyes."
3,Quality but dont fit my face,"I don't have a giant head, but it is on the large side. The mask will probably fit your perfect or let some of the light through the bottom like it did for me. It is molded or shaped and does not mold to the face. As I said, a little smaller head and it probably would have been perfect."
4,Good eye mask for traveling,I recently used this eye mask and ear plugs on flight to Tokyo. They worked excellently. And the travel pouch helped me keep these items together and handy.
5,Can't sleep without it!,"I love this mask. It's lightweight and blocks the light, but doesn't push on your eyes.Highly recommended!"
2,This mask is not 'breathable',The concept is good. Room around the eyes so its not pressing against the eyelids. The problem with this mask is the material. It was sold as breathable fabric. This is a lie. It is polyester or some sort of synthetic material. I broke out with acne after one wearing and I do not have acne or suffer from breakouts I am in my 30's and have not had acne on my face since being a teenager ).
2,Poor Quality,"My first disappointment with the mask was with the fit; there is a gap around the nose. But given that my nose is narrow. and it was only a small amount of light getting in, I was willing to overlook that. Of course that would may have been more of an issue if I was trying to sleep in a brighter environment but I was using mainly to keep the morning light from waking me up.However after only a few weeks of use, the inner layer of fabric separated from the outer. I may be able to repair with some fabric glue but I will most likely just look for a better quality product."
3,Great product at first...,"This item was really nice at first but started falling apart right away after normal wear. After 2-3 months the lining had started hanging by a thread. However, the price is really reasonable so replacing with another isn't really a big deal - maybe I'll have better luck with the next one."
3,Love/Hate,I got this eye mask for myself a few months ago. I loved it! It's great how it's molded so that you can blink without fabric pressed up against your lids. However I use an eye mask every night and it started to fall apart and separate after a few months.
2,"Close, but no cigar","Pros: light-weight, the nose contour helps cut-down on light entering from belowCons:1. the strap is too short, and the velcro is overlapped in the back, which for me is an uncomfortable lump on the back of my head (even with pillow), and gives me a headache sometimes2. the too-stiff molded item shifts a bit when I sleep on my side, resulting in light coming in3. the nose portion is too small, and I have a normal-size nose; hence, light comes in at bottomHey manufacturer: let the strap go around the head and put the velcro on the mask itself, and make the item thinner around nose and reinforce it with a wire that the user can bend to custom fit the mask around the nose."
2,Doesn't work for me,"First off, it might be OK if you sleep like a mummy - always on your back, and never moving. But if you roll on your side, forget it. And as has been noted, it lets light in around the nose, which is killer.A black t-shirt works better."
1,Returned,"It did not keep the light out below eyes on each side of nose. It may fit the shape of some faces, but will not fit all being made so rigidly."
2,Falls apart after a few weeks of usage,"I've been wearing these every night for several years. I've tried several brands of sleep masks and these really are the most comfortable. They do a great job of blocking out light and are so lightweight I barely notice them.HOWEVER, the fabric invariably detaches after a few weeks of use, eventually become so bad that you have to buy a brand new mask. Basically, if you wear these every night you will need to buy a new pair every 6-8 weeks. And don't even think about washing them - one good wash is enough to render them totally useless.If the manufacturer would just fix this one fatal flaw this would be a five star product. Honestly, all they need to do is add some stiching or apply a more dirable adhesive at the edges around the nose. I would glady pay 4x the price for these masks if they didn't fall apart so easily."
1,Terrible build quality!,The lining of the face mask is detaching from the foam. Both front and back lining are fixed to the foam with adhesive and sewn only in the elastic strap area. Came apart within six months of daily use.
1,Comfortable but not durable at all,"The product was very comfortable. However, the components started coming apart after the 3rd night of using it, if the product was longer lasting it would definitly have gotten a much higher rating."
1,Mask glued together,The lining (which sits against your face) is glued onto the front part of the mask. The glue stopped working for me within 3 months.
1,Dream Essentials Sleep Mask,"Excited when I received this thinking it would be great because of the shape of the mask. It will not stay on and I ended up losing sleep trying to find it throughout the night. It is also very uncomfortable, and the ear plugs are a joke."
1,Product Falls Apart,"This product works for a few months, but has fallen apart into layers. Otherwise it works pretty well, the material is light and soft."
5,Great for travel,"This mask has a lightweight and sleek design, folds nicely into a small carrying pouch (along with the ear plugs, included). It's perfect for traveling or sneaking a power nap on your lunch break. I travel a lot and far so I take my mask with me on a plane. Pop it on and you're ""gone"" in minutes. A few people have already asked me about it and I also had to get one for my friend. The delivery on both was great by the way - shipped w/in minutes of standard ordering! 7/17/08: It's been over a year and I still love my mask :) Just got back from Alaska where it helped me sleep through those white polar nights"
5,Wife Loves The Mask,"Best one she has used, not that we have tried many but this one beats the last few. Very soft."
5,Very Good,"I work nightshift so a good sleep mask if very important. I used to just use a thin flimsy mask that I don't even know where I got. It was OK but I didn't know any better. I bought this mask off amazon and let me tell you there IS a difference. The shape of the nose and eyes helps allot. The mask was allot thicker and more substantial than I expected. The material is comfortable (almost like a wetsuit material but softer) and it does a complete job of blacking out all the light. Forget the other masks, this one is super nice."
4,"Great Design, Wonderful Experience","I am pleased with this mask as it's design seems well thought out being very light weight and comfortable. A key feature for me was the contoured eye covers which allow for the eyes to open without coming in contact with the mask. Before I slept with the mask on, I ran a test with the lights on, first off this mask is an absolute blackout with one exception. I was able to find a slight light leak around the nose piece which was so insignificant that I literally had to look down to notice it. My purchase came with a small nylon bag and set of ear plugs which surprisingly I found to be very useful. I usually don't wear ear plugs; however, the design of these are so amazing that I hardly felt them in my ears. Overall wonderful purchase, highly recommended."
4,Best mask,With the longer days it's just too dang bright in the mornings sometimes. I like to sleep in on the weekends and using this mask really helps. I've had eye masks before but they sat directly on my eyes and dried them out overnight. I'm loving the contoured feature of this mask.The earplugs are too big for my ears but they really aren't needed so no worries there.
2,My 1st sleep mask,"I was not able to eliminate the light between the nose and cheeks in the mask. Additionally, I find the strap uncomfortable enough to inhibit sleep. I have not used it in weeks.I would not recommend this sleep mask."
3,Too bulky,"This mask does a really good job blocking the light as well as staying on the face during sleep. However, I do feel that some of this efficiency comes with the sacrifice on comfort.The problem here is that the mask is just way too bulky. When I move around in my sleep, the part that covers the nose, will actually push uncomfortably against the nostrils. The strap that goes around the head is very thick and sometimes chafes the skin on top of my ears. And finally, the same strap has a Velcro attachment that overlaps, creating a pressure point on the back of the head, making it rather uncomfortable to sleep on my back.So for light sleepers such as myself, there is no escaping the feeling that there is some kind of bulky contraption on my face. Ideally, a product such as this, that's supposed to help you fall a sleep, should minimize this unpleasant sensation."
5,perfect!,"this was just what i needed - now i finally get the hours of sleep i need, since i'm not being woken up by the light.highly recommended..."
5,"So comfy, I forgot I was wearing them!","I got these for a long trip last summer to the Canadian Rockies and Alaska. We were tent camping and the sun doesn't really set at all during the second half of June in much of Alaska so I wanted something that would keep the light out. I have never been someone who could wear a mask when I sleep because they always touch my eyes and I can feel them and it keeps me awake. These, though, have no such problem! They are as soft and light as can be and the eye areas are cupped so they do not touch your face at all! Yet they blocked out 99% of the light and allowed me to sleep even in the land of the midnight sun. My daughter also used them and loved them. They are adjustable and even come with ear plugs (though we did not use them) and a little drawstring case. I recommend these."
3,Good for 7 months,"This thing lasted me seven months. The lining on the inside fell off completely. I tried to remove it, but the surface left over was sticky, so I threw it away. It did a decent job keeping the light out while I used it. By this I mean it kept out small LED lights and the bit that came through the window shade at night, but in the morning plenty of light would get in around the nose. This was fine for me since it helped me wake up. But it may not be fine for some. I have a large head, and it did fit me well enough. I did have to adjust the straps in relation to my ears through the night the first few months because it would irritate my ears and the back of my head. After that I got used to it. I will say that it was worth the price. I will shop around for something better. I would definitely be willing to pay more for something that lasts longer and fits a bit closer around the nose. However, until I can find something better, I will get one of these every seven months."
4,Get what you pay for,"The other reviews are pretty much spot on - you get what you pay for. It works well, very well in fact. There is NO light going through the material and it is very soft. However, it is formed foam and as such it does not adhere to your face, there is some space where light comes in by the nose but to clarify this is NOT A CUSTOM MASK!!! It is also too small for my head, where i have about a half inch of velcro keeping it together.It does the job. Are there better products? Maybe but it's all a matter of preference and head shape/size. If you have a smaller head and/or a round nose I believe you would be rating this 5 stars."
2,"Nice idea, poor execution.","These look great, but don't work too well.The part that covers the nose actually let's in lots of light, and is not that comfortable on the nose.I have a few pairs of eye masks - I travel a lot, and just leave them in different lugagge/bags to save timepacking.By far the best ones are the Bucky brand: http://www.amazon.com/Bucky-Blinks-Mask-Ultralight-Eye/dp/B000FIJ07G/ref=pd_sim_hpc_1I really wanted to like these, as the material is pretty nice, but they just don't work that well"
3,Needs improvement...,"The sleep mask itself is very effective at totally blocking out light. The contour is very comfortable. The mask itself seem well constructed. There is, however, a problem, and that is with the elasticity of the headband. The band stretches considerably with nightly wear. A higher quality band should be attached in order to gain full use from the mask.I would recommend this mask for use while traveling, but I would not recommend it for continuous nightly use at home."
5,Sleep mask comfort!,"I've used sleep mask before, of course, but this one is light, fits comfortably over my nose, and folds conveniently for travel use. Great product! I don't use ear plugs, so they were of no value to me."
3,not too impressed,"With my job I usually don't wake up until 11am so a sleeping mask has become critical for me to get a good nights sleep. Anyways, until now I have always used the freebie masks you get when you fly international. I have to say some of the freebie ones I have had were better than this one. The strap is nice and easy to adjust with the velcro elastic strap, but it goes right over your ear which can be quite uncomfortable. Some light is visible from the nose part as well. The good things are the material that is used it really soft and it conforms to the face well."
4,"Not Bad, but there are issues!","I have tried all types of sleeping mask. I got this one after reading the reviews and I must say it is a good mask, but like all things it has its flaws. Cons: I only had this make for a few months and haven't washed it yet, the inner cover/material has started to peel apart from the layers. Today it has completely fallen off. I still use it without the inner material, but now since that has came off the Eye Interior Chamber doesn't protrude out anymore. Which is why I brought this? Also it comes off my face a lot at night, due to I am a side sleeper. I think this should have been an adjustable slider band instead of Velcro. Pros: It does do a good job keeping out the light and I love the breathable materials. I found some mask makes me sweat, due to my hot flashes. I will never go back to a regular mask after trying a mask with Interior Chamber, which is a plus!."
4,Nice Mask,"I bought this for my trip overseas and I end up using it regularly at home. It's true that light gets in from the nose. However, this doesn't bother me that much. I do like how the eyes are contoured."
2,Tired man,"The mask worked sort of well at first. But the whole product is pointless since it doesn't fit correctly. Light is peeking in too much. It only works if it sits on your face perfectly, and it simply will not do this. The elastic strap also wears very easily and quickly. Once this happens it becomes pretty loose. By 1 week the mask only partially blocks light, which is pointless since I am still waking up just as much."
1,"Uncomfortable and won't stay on,",The straps on the mask are connected at such a point (and an odd angle) that the mask rubs on my ears and is painful. If I adjust so the mask does not rub it slides off very easily. It also is slightly too small around and is tight. I have an average sized head so anyone with a larger head should not buy this product. It also allows light in at the nose. I cannot even use this. Waste of money.
1,Disappointing,"I was excited about this. I'd had a contoured sleeping mask once before and wore it until it wore out, so I was glad to be getting another one. The one I'd owned before came from a different source and a different manufacturer. I finally received this one and, when I went to bed I put it on. It squeezed my nose. Really. The shape of the nose near the bottom caused it to partially pinch my nose closed. I am a woman with an average nose. If it squeezes my nose, it would be worse for anyone with a large or wide nose. Anyone with any sort of sleeping problem probably knows that your nose needs to be as open as possible in order to sleep well. I already have stuffy nose problems, and this mask only adds to that. Because of the nose squeeze and pinch, I can't wear the mask. It causes breathing problems. I have to breathe out of my mouth. I will be returning the mask to the seller."
5,Love this sleep mask!,"over the years, i've owned quite a few sleep masks. one of the worst ones was the pillow type that pushes against my eye lids and lashes. this one, however, doesn't touch the eyes so i don't feel any pressure. it really does block out all the light and the strap is comfortable, too. i love this mask so much that i almost don't care how long it lasts but will be happy to purchase again to have 1 or 2 on hand."
5,"Fantastic, highly recommended!","I bought these before a looooong flight to europe after a bad experience previously. I wanted to make sure I was comfortable and could sleep. These are very nice because they don't press on your eyeballs. They do a very good job of keeping out the light, but no eye covers have ever completely worked on that area around the nose. Maybe one day someone will invent the perfect sleep mask to block out 100% of the light so none creeps in, but these do a very good job. It's the best mask I've ever used, and I've used several."
3,works pretty well,"I used this recently on an overseas trip. I would have to say that it did block out light and was fairly comfortable. I think the comfort level would greatly depend on your face. For me, it put a little pressure on my nose and I had to wear it higher on my face than it is really made for. Having said that, I do not think it prevented me from sleeping and the earplugs that came with it were great. I will continue using it."
4,"Works ok, gap around nose","I used this for several nights. The mask is quite comfortable, and my fears that it would be hard to sleep with the earplugs were not met. My only complaint is that the nose portion is not adequately bent to fit the nose, so there is definitely light leakage in that area."
3,It's falling apart!,I've had this about a month & wear it every night & the lining is seperating from the foam. I really like the shape & it is comfortable so I will try to glue/sew it.
4,Pretty good for the money,The thing I try to keep in mind is that everyone's face is shaped differently. This mask is fairly comfortable and it blocks 80% of the light for me. A little light gets in at the top and around the nose. In a fairly dark room it is not noticable. But in the light of day the light does come in a little. But as I said for the money this mask does a decent job.
5,Sweet Dream!,"After a recent to trip to Alaska, this product was the only thing that gave me a restful night's sleep in the land of the midnight sun. The mask's contours ensured that is stayed in place and the elastic did not dig into my scalp or slip/tangle in my hair. My tent mate thought I looked pretty silly but what's a night's worth of drug free sleep worth to you? The pouch with ear plugs makes it easy to pack for any occassion whether for camping or long flights. Great product!"
2,Lightweight but not very comfortable,"I'm not sure why this mask is rated so highly. I've been using it for about three weeks before i reviewed it. Firstly, sure it's lightweight and fits nicely around the face. However the nose part is uncomfortable and pinches the top part of my nose. Also the velcro straps for the back of the head have sharp-ish edges and can get very uncomfortable around the years, and the velcro gets stuck in my hair. Really not recommended. Unless you have short hair and a small narrow nose!"
3,Decent,"The nose is too fitted to a particular type of nose. I have an Asian nose, so it does not fit me right. I have to wear the mask upside to be more comfortable. It does the job in keeping out the light, but it's not very breathable. The material is pretty heavy, which I suppose functions well to keep out light, but also can be hot."
4,Good Night,"Good, not perfect, but there is really no perfect solution...do not believe what others say. This is the best mask for the price. Gets the job done and without crushing your beautiful lashes!"
1,Delightful product...for one month.,"This would be _the_ ideal sleep mask for me: very comfortable, fits well, and is lightweight. I had used one before that had just a little separation around the nose after several months, so I decided to buy a new one. Unfortunately, the new one started to fall apart after less than a month of daily use, and now two months in it's half separated. It still works, but it's quite annoying that it's fallen apart. It's not like it's being warped and twisted into coming apart, but just being worn for a few hours a day. I don't really expect high quality at this price, but I think it's not unreasonable to have a product that at least lasts for more than one month."
3,Not Bad,This mask does a good job. It is fairly light and unnoticeable in terms of the bulk of the mask. It's generally comfortable and will do the trick. There is a slight leak of light at the side of the nostril. It's very small but it is there.
2,Strap is uncomfortable,"I am very sensitive to light when I sleep. Until now, I have been relying on cheap eye covers handed out on long international flights. After discovering this product and reading the reviews, I was very excited. The product looks like a small bra. The material is similar to a bra with padding. It is comfortable and provides excellent light protection. However, the back strap that goes behind the head is uncomfortable. It has a velcro joint to adjust the size of the strap, and this lands right behind my head. So, when I sleep on my back, I can feel it pressing against my head and it is uncomfortable. Bad design!"
2,Didn't work for me.,"I returned this mask after 1 night of use. It did not work for me at all. Light was still considerably let in, it tickled my face if I moved slightly, and most importantly, even with the contouring my eyelids still touched the mask, which is a deal breaker for me. I returned it for the Bucky's 40 Blinks mask, and that works much better. I found there to be no need to cover the nose, which the Bucky's does not. This might work for some, but not for me."
2,This eyemask hurts..,"I bought this eyemask recently and after my first night of use, i knew it wasn't for me. I was woken up many times by pains in my ear because the bare velcro strip was pressing into the top of my ear. HUGE CON. Like with that issue, the eyemask isn't even worth it. I'm very dissapointed in my eyebra."
2,Beware the Nose Fit,"I love the concept of this product, and, upon receiving it, liked the adjustable Velcro head strap, and the material it was made of. But my fiancee had an issue with the nose fit -- he has a fairly wide, puggy nose -- and ultimately we're returning it so we can find something less fitted.Basically, just determine if your nose looks like the shape of the one in the picture. I know you can't please all the people all the time; this time it was just our turn."
4,sleep mask,"The contoured eye mask is very comfortable and does a good job at keeping the light out. Haven't used the ear plugs yet, but the mask is great."
4,Dream Mask,"This mask does great at keeping light out. However, it pinches my nose. It makes breathing out of my nose challenging. My husband says I snore terribly now."
2,Fabric layers separated.,After a few months the foam layer came away from the poly layer. I had to sew the layers back together. Too much effort to put into a low price product. Just spend more on a higher quality build.
3,Stiff,Guess I should have figured by looking at the picture that this is more like a Halloween mask than a sleeping mask.IT is very stiff especially around the nose area. I find soft masks much more comfortable. Nice that there is room so thatthe eyes and lashes do not press on the mask. Keeps light out well except for around the nose (could be my nose just doesn't fit the mask). I will go back to my soft mask.
3,Dream Essentials Sweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask,"I can't really tell if i like this or not, It does let light in from your nose, I really didnt think that woyuld be a problem till i actually got it and put it on, the straps are a little unfriendly and hurt my head because of how rough the straps are.the edges of it arent really soft either. The concave design feels nice above your eyes but thats all that I liked, This was my first sleep mask, and I am Curious of what some of the other ones feel like. But for $10 this wasn't that bad"
4,a little light coming through,"An excellent sleep mask, unless you are bothered by a tiny bit of light that can peep through if your nose is not the right shape for a perfect fit. My daughter uses this mask and loves it. For her, the bit of light showing through is not an issue, she can still sleep fine with the mask on."
4,Product served the purpose that I was looking for,I purchased this product to see if it would help improve my quality of sleep. I can't say that it did that but I don't know that this product or any other related product would do that-I may have been expecting too much from it. It is comfortable and easy to wear but does frequently come off during the middle of the night. That may be because I don't wear it as tightly as I should. I would definitely buy it again.
4,Comfy and blocks light,"The mask blocks the light completely except for right around the bridge of the nose where a little light can get in. However, I don't really think it's the fault of the manufacturer because how could they ever create a mask that fits every face perfectly without being too tight? I really like that the mask is comfy and doesn't give me a headache or bother me to wear it while sleeping. Been using it for a few weeks now with absolutely no issues."
1,"Initially good, but turns out bad!","I bought this excitedly based on the reviews here and for the first 3 months it was good. Now the story turns for the worst, it started with an eye reaction and then my entire top half of my face broke out in a rash. After i stopped wearing the mask my rash went away. I would not recommend this mask to anyone with sensitive skin."
1,No good if used more than 5 times,"I purchased this product for overnight flights and after the first couple of trips the inside layer of material began to separate. I contacted the vendor and was sent another, as I was told they had been sent a bad batch. Well, the same thing happened with the second mask, same amount of times used and same layer of material."
2,Great Night Sleep,"At first I really loved this sleep mask. I was concerned about the outdents for your eyes, but it worked well. The bottom line is, they are cheap. After 2-3 weeks of use the silky part of the mask started coming off making it very annoying to use the sleep mask. I'd spring for something a little more expensive if you actually want a product that will last."
2,"Good product, short lasting.","I need a sleeping mask regularly because I live in a dorm with roommates who wake up and turn lights on before I'm ready to start my day. This worked really well, for a while. I'm sensitive to anything pressing against my eyes, and I'm sensitive to getting headaches if the strap is too tight and hurts my ears. This has an adjustable velcro strap to prevent ear pain and the contoured eyes keep the pressure away.Problem is, I've been using this for about half a semester and the lining came undone, so the nylon layer that touches the face has completely fallen off. It got me through for a short while, but not nearly long enough."
3,Dream essentials sweet dreams,"Good but not great, they feel cheap, they do what they are ment to do and do it very well, the earplugs that come in the package are worthless, look elsewhere for earplugs"
5,Simply Sleep,This eyemask fits snuggly to your face keeping all light out. I use it everynight. Its the best one I've ever bought. I highly recommend it.
2,Not impressed,"First of all this product is identical to the ""Lights Out Contoured Sleeping Mask"" by Spacific Essentials, except that this mask costs less. I ordered both, and they are identical.Second, the Velcro closure on the back of the head-strap forms an uncomfortable 'bump' on the back of my head that makes it almost impossible to sleep with this mask on.Third, the mask does leak some light in around the nose.I am still looking."
3,Overrated...,"Hey, I would of given this a 4, but it seems to be quite overrated.I only say that because *You Can Still See Light! (at the bottom of your nose)I've tried several sleep mask, and the only ones that I've seen that gives you 100% complete black out, are the Tempurpedic or Memory Foam ones...The good part about this sleep mask, over the Tempurpedic one is that is very light... it'll be more gentle on your face. Also the light that gets through is 70-80% cured if you closed your eyes..."
4,Sleep Dreams Indeed,"Planning a trip to the UK, I researched many different sleep masks to use on my flights. I liked what I read about Sweet Dreams Sleep Mask and gave it a try. Boy, I was not disappointed! It is really soft and it blocked out the light COMPLETELY. Sleeping on a plane is never an easy task, but I slept very well since I was completely in the dark. Upon arriving at my destination I had absolutely no jet lag and I believe it was purely because by using Sweet Dreams Sleep Mask I was able to sleep and get on the right time zone. One complaint is the band going around your head to hold it in place is a bit long for a small head. Since it has velcro I was able to make it work though. While it is excellent for travel, I wouldn't recommend it for home use if you are a side sleeper because it doesn't stay in place very well then. If your in the market for one definately give this a try!"
1,Didn't even last a year,Mask is very comfortable and did the job for the first 6 months or so but then slowly started coming apart.
4,Not for big noses,"This mask is really nice, its made of a comfortable material and has an adjustable fit but it is NOT made for people with big noses... I had to cut up the center of the bridge of the nose to make it sit properly on my face..."
4,perfect fit,"This is a very well made and comfortable product for my use. I bought it since my wife always read at night with her lamp on and sometimes we leave the fan on running high and it always drys out my eyes. I have several different eye masks before but they are never a good fit for me (Note: my face shape is quite special since my nose is point at the bridge compared to others, so other eye masks always allow light streaming in from under the masks) and their materials cannot give my skin and pore a chance to breathe. This one is perfect because it literally keeps all lights out and it allows air flow."
2,travelmonkey,"This was a christmas present and it seemed like a good idea. An oversized sleeping mask that's padded. Unfortunately it looks like you are wearing a bra on your face. In fact it even feels like it's contoured like one. The thing that's good is that it keeps your eyeballs from having pressure applied to them but again it looks to all passengers around you like you are sleeping with a bra on your face. It's also rather large for an eye mask, maybe 2-3x bigger than any other I've seen."
2,too big for a small woman,im a 110 lbs woman and this mask was way to big for my face. Seems like more of a mans mask. I also didnt like the nose being covered.
3,Strap is short and too wide - leaky around nose,"I've been on a search for a good mask for years, and sadly, my search continues.I know I have a big head, but the strap seems way too short. At it's largest adjustment, it squeezes my head. The strap is also about 3/4 inch wide, and it rubs the tops of my ears after a while. I can't imagine sleeping an entire night with this mask - it would be very uncomfortable. In general, I use it only when I wake up because the room is too bright. I slap it on for an hour or so, but honestly, I don't think it would be good for longer than that.The worst thing is the molded area around the nose. Everyone's face is shaped differently, so I would think a soft nose area would mold to your face much better than this mask. There's always a bit of light that sneaks in, no matter how much I adjust it.The earplugs that came with are nice, though. Nice freebie."
5,"Most comprehensive, unbiased Disney guide available!","So many Disney guide books are filled with ""fluff"" about how wonderful the ""World"" can be they seem to have been written by Disney himself. I've read them all, and to me this is by far the best guide, and most unbiased. Although it's very thick, the reading is easy and fun. The opinions, suggestions, and tips are great! This book is a complete ""must have"" to plan a trip for everyone from children to seniors."
4,"The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World, 2006",Good book to have but it's really long. If you have a lot of time it would be perfect. It has a lot of great tips and ideas in it.
4,Helpful,I am a yearly visitor to Disney World and still find this book helpful. I am able to pinpoint the room location and view that my family desires at a particular resort. I have found that we do not use the touring pages in the book. If you are a first time visitor with only a few days to get to see the parks then this book is for you. .
3,There's such a thing as too much information!!,"You could drive yourself nuts planning a trip to Disney World with this book! Go here first, do this last, don't do this on X day...and on and on. Apparently, you may not go to Disney World without a plan and spontaneity has no place on your trip. With that said, I had to give the book a decent review b/c I followed the directions given and scored tickets to Cinderella's Table for the day I wanted!"
5,THIS IS THE ONE!!!,"THIS IS THE ONE!!! DO NOT PLAN A DISNEY TRIP WITHOUT IT! The time and $ this book will save you will make its cost be totally irrelevant.We started using our first version of this ""Doing Disney Bible"" about 9 years ago, when we first went to Disney. We have gone back to Disney five times since then, and have always purchase a revised edition of this same book! (Need I say more.) It will make your stay as pleasant as possible, given any time of year or condition that you may encounter. We purchase the revised edition each time, because, amazingly, so many things change at the parks, and therefore, so do their recommendations.Due to their layout, It is so easy to pick and choose the information that is important to you. I WOULD NEVER WANT TO GO TO DISNEY WITHOUT THIS BOOK!"
5,If you are going to WDW for the first time you need this book!,"If it is your first visit to WDW you need this book. It may not give the floweriest, or most gushing reviews of the hotels and restaurants, but the tour plans at the back are the best.If you follow Bob's advice, you won't find yourself waiting in line for hours. You don't have to stick to the plans rigidly either, just follow his advice on which rides build up crowds quickly in the morning. And remember to take his most important piece of advice - arrive at the parks early as soon as they open - you won't regret it.WDW Super Plannerwww.mywdwtrip.com"
5,Great guide book!,"I've been to WDW a few times in the past few years, and this book taught me a few things I didn't know! The touring plans are especially helpful for first-timers, and are not as commando as one may think. It's nice to have some opinions that are not glossed-over, as in ""official"" guide books. I also appreciate their sense of humor...Last year I bought the Unofficial Guide to Disneyland, since we were taking our first vacation there, and it was a godsend! We saw it all, did it all, and were actually quite relaxed about it - no running from attraction to attraction was necessary, and we avoided long lines while enjoying ourselves tremendously!"
5,Most helpful,"This book helped us to plan our trip. It details lodging inside the park as well as those hotels outside the park. It has maps of each of the Disney Resorts with tips on which rooms to ask for. We hadn't been to Disney World in 15 years and weren't sure what was there. This book told us all that and more. It gave us tips on what park attractions to see during different times of the day and numerous tips for dining, lodging and getting around the parks. It gives details of each and every attraction at Disney World and Universal. It rates the rides for various age groups. It rates the restaurants and food courts in various categories. We carried it in a backpack everywhere we went and referred to it often during our stay. I would recommend this book to anyone going to Disney World for the first time or the fifty fifth time."
1,What is going on...,"It tried to hard to be funny that it completely misses the point. Also every actor except for the Masterson's are god awful, and I usually like Warburton."
2,"Uh, no","I have to be honest. I watched this purely to see James Purefoy, but with Giamatti and a good backstory, I figured it would be at least fairly entertaining. Nah, not so much. I think if you are going to do history, you do history. This faux history crap just was too unbelievable to keep me entertained. Then you have this worthless love interest. I get why the filmmakers figured they had to put it in (because sex sells and you have to have a hot chick in a dark, bloody movie, right?), but if you are going to do it, do it right. This was just silly. I gave it two stars because it did have the dark and gritty look you'd expect from a movie of this time period and despite the horrible story, Purefoy did a great job. :)"
5,great move,its said its based on a true story ....well i live it its like what it was saying brave heart bloody graphics
4,Our ancient history on motion picture.,From time to time appears on screen motion picture striving to depict our history as real as we can understand. Ironclad is one of them. It is a brilliant interpretation.Brutal as life was. A great photography and a production quite based on facts. A good movie in all.Andria
3,Vikings speaking Hungarian? LOL!,"If you love medieval gore this is a good movie! If you're looking for a historical one, this movie is not for you. Never mind the fact that King John not used any ""Viking"" aka Scandinavian mercenaries, in the movie they are speaking in Hungarian in the background! This also makes this movie very comical. Over all I would give Ironclad 3 stars for good old fashioned gore and grit, I would have given 4 starts if the mercenaries would have spoken in Danish, Norvegian, Swedish or even German -- but Hungarian? The acting was a bit over the top too, especially by Paul Giamatti."
3,Id give it 3 and 1/2.,Good movie but a little gorey. Paul Giamantti does an OK job but overall the acting leaves a little to be desired. A low budget but very informative movie about the Magna Carta. Worth a rent if you like medieval era movies.
2,"""The Magnificent Seven"" with swords instead of guns","Well, the product description had that right: ""A Medieval Magnificent Seven...""Except not nearly as entertaining. Now I can see why this flick went straight to video.There were some interesting scenes. When Paul Giamatti was on screen tearing up the scenery as King John, that was interesting. The same with most of Brian Cox's scenes.Other than that, this flick didn't really have much going for it. A lot of swordplay VERY loosely set in a historical context. A bunch of actors I didn't recognize, many speaking in such deep accents I had a hard time figuring out what they were saying, swinging a bunch of swords around amid a lot of MTV-type jittery camera work.Ummmm... yeah. If you're really desperate to kill a couple of hours, I guess this beats dental surgery."
1,Made for TV?,"Why do we have Hungarian speaking, what should be, Christian Danes (Christianized long before this event.) attacking what should be a sizable city? (Props and sets people maybe could only afford the castle.)Why do we have the stereotypic Magnificent Seven or whatever ( including the usual handsome young wannabe) being rounded up in the usual way to defend the country against ridiculous odds as usual?Why is most, and I mean most, of the movie comical slicing and dicing sword play and the adversaries seem to always come one at a time like waiting to go through a turnstile?Why do the lead actors resumes seem to be heavily loaded on TV shorts and episodes? Is that a clue?Why is Knights Templar such a must have these days? Is it because secret conspiracy groups are so entertainment profitable."
3,Twenty against One Thousand? Realy?!,It's an entertaining action flick but totally unrealistic and therefore unbelievable. And what's up with the Hungarian speaking Danish mercenaries? This is the type of film one would watch if bored with noting to do.
5,War isn't pretty - caught the spirit of what it means to fight for what you believe in,"It was over the top on gore, but I think it demonstrated well the war is not pretty or enjoyable idea. I loved that it explained what they were fighting for and how it was the history the American founding fathers were aware of when they signed the Declaration of Independence. I think James Purefoy was amazing! He really can act! It was amazing to see him play a good guy for once and not an evil prince/king or messed up Marcus Anthony. It had just enough of the relationship between Marshal and Isabel to keep the chick flick lover in me happy, and the rest satisfied the ""spirit of history"" lover in me. I love, love, love the ending!!!!! Yes, it is not technically historically acurate, but it caught the spirit of the time. It is a great prequel to the Tudors. If you loved the Tudors series, you will enjoy, maybe even love this movie. I would love to see a sequel!"
1,Uncomfortable,"Cervical collars all have ""foam"" padding in certain places to create a comfortable fit. This collar is actually made from a very stiff styrofoam material that came folded in the box and did not ""round out"" after unpacking. It's extremely uncomfortable for someone with a sore neck. It is in two pieces and the tight fold from storage and packaging made the inside pieces on either side rub into the neck. Keep shopping."
2,Uncomfortable,"On the one hand, I'm well aware that I get what I pay for. On the other hand, I was fairly certain that the low price on this collar was/is an indication that it didn't have much to offer. Therefore, my bad. I should have (and maybe will ) shell out lots more $$ for a collar that is comfortable enough to wear, even when sleeping."
4,Berkley Big Water Braid,"I've used quite a few different braids mainly as backing for yellowfin tuna,And have found this line to be the best all round line. Very strong very thin and well priced.The only thing I have noticed is that every aprox 700 yards the line has a factory join, I was a bit paranoid about this at first but after testing the strength of the line where the joins are I found that it never brakes where there is a join. So it seems it's nothing to worry about.I have bought it from Amazon 2 times in 80lb and 65lb and have not had any problems.Thanks."
3,Fantastic Music; Shameful Transfer to CD,"I'm pleased that this recording finally became available, but I was sorely disappointed when it arrived. I assumed it had been remastered in Japan, but the CD was made in Brazil, where, a lazy, flat monophonic recording was used for the transfer. It's unfortunate that Bear Family Records did not produce this CD, since they would have done such an incredible job with it, as they have with Caterina Valente's other albums. That said, the music is wonderful, and a vinyl copy of this record is impossible to find--and Caterina Valente is remarkable--she's at her vocal best here. I'd still pay $40 bucks for this CD, but now I'm on the lookout for a stereo copy of the vinyl. Sigh."
5,Incredible!,"This is a really cool movie. The special effects and sound are awesome. The movie just sweeps you into it. Sam Neill, Joseph Mazello, and Ariana Richards do a great job together as they are lost in the park. As the movie goes along, they give you all sorts of hints as what's going to happen, then later, those hints all come together. It's full of suprises and twists and turns, as the story will leave you on the edge of your seat. It's not a nightmare giver, but it is a little creepy. This is the coolest movie ever, and it's a definate must-see!"
3,Spielberg's shallow thrill ride.,"Jurassic Park, while exciting and awesome in parts, is no Jaws. The movie is really an excuse for Spielberg to mount the greatest Ray Harryhausen movie never made, and he succeeds far too brilliantly. The commentary and conscious of Crichton's terrifying novel is disposed of in favor of easy thumbnail sketch characters and simplistic narrative tools to make the monster movie machine hum right along. Once the dinosaurs do get loose the movie drops any pretense of developing or even caring about the 'characters' and invites the audience to simply enjoy the spectacle of the attacks. The pioneering effects may make this an essential in some collections, but the lack of dramatic weight makes it no more effective that its 1950s drive-in cinema cousins The Black Scorpion or The Deadly Mantis. Recommended just for the thrill of it all."
4,A great dinosaur film,"Scientists learn how to recreate living dinosaurs via recovered DNA fragments, and a rich entrepreneur uses this knowledge to construct a prehistoric amusement park on a remote island. He brings in a team to evaluate his living attractions, and from that point forward everything that can go wrong does.The lean, economical screenplay, by Michael Crichton and David Koepp, does just what it needs to--it moves us efficiently from thrill to thrill. Only at the very end do the writers get sloppy. In this movie, however, it's really the special effects that matter. These dinosaurs live and breathe. I remember when I first saw this movie in the theaters back in '93; I don't recall ever being so impressed with the technical mastery of a film. Even today, when almost every film seems to include some CGI, the effects hold up very well."
5,A true classic,I have never been more frightend in a theatre than during the first T-REX scene in this movie. The plot-line is good and the dinosaur scenes are spectacular!
5,You'll believe dinosaurs walked the Earth.,"When I was driving home from the theater after this movie, I did look at birds differently. I swore any minute a dinosaur could run out from behind a building. This is and was the best dinosaur movie I've ever seen. Who doesn't like a good dino movie? And how old is it now and it still holds up well against other movies' special effects today.As for the story, some will say it's slow, but I think the pacing is perfect and although kids now a days might think there isn't enough action, I think the build up to the first time you see the Tyrannosaurus Rex attack is one of the greatest moments in movie cinema. It's intense, scary, even funny, and best of all you don't think about the special effects because you're watching a real 8 ton monster wreak havoc. The movie is worth this scene alone and then when the raptors come you'll be jumping and at the edge of your seat.Love this movie."
5,The first and one of the best action movies I have ever seen,"As the title sais this was the first blockbuster action film I ever saw. I know young children love dinosaurs, but this dino film is difenately not for them. I think it is a wonderful adaptation of the book. as most of you know Jurassic park was a break through in special effects, and won Three academy awards. I highly recomend this great movie about survival."
3,think about your customers,what i want to say is about the marketing on 3d movies that they are great to watch but they cost to much the way they are package on older release movies most likely customer already own the blu ray o dvd version they should have the choice of just buying the 3d version on a better cost so they should be sold on its own
3,"Mindless ""Entertainment""","Having watched this again, many years after the original release, I am no longer as impressed with it as I once was. The story is very lacking. The characters are poorly developed. I found that I cared more about the dinosaurs than the characters. About the only thing this movie is good for these days is as a film-making history lesson, as this was the first time a movie had ever gone so far with CGI. In its time, it pushed the boundaries with special effects, but as technology continues to advance a good story is necessary for it to stand the test of time, and that is where it falls short."
1,Never buy from this seller,"I wanted to get this movie for my little girl who loves Dinosaurs,its been over a month and I have yet to receive it in the mail."
1,A poor excuse of a movie-explains why I waited to see it....,"I have always said that the sure sign of a ""bad movie"" is when you start cheering for the ""bad guys"". In this poor excuse of a movie, I started hoping against hope that the dinosaurs would eat every human on the island. The special effects are cool; the movie isn't. A highly (and I mean HIGHLY) overated waste of time - do yourself a favor and read the book instead."
2,Why?,Why can Spielberg can create such visually stunning films yet cannot find a script worthy of a TV movie of the week. This film is a prime example of how actors without quality dialog are reduced to stage props.
1,Spielberg is a hack (reason #4),Better watch out! Big dinosaurs gonna eat you up! More childish slapdash from the master of schlock. Ohhhh cool effects dude! The only saving grace I give this entire movie is the scene where fat Newman (Seinfeld) gets sparyed with dino-snot by the lil veloscoraptors (sp?)
1,Lame story,"This movie is totally lame. It is an established fact that dinosaurs died thousands of years ago and there are no dinos alive today. The story here is that somehow some of the dinos managed to hide in a little island unknown to man and survived, only to be discovered by the characters in the movie. It is so unbelievable that even my 8 year old kid brother was laughing at the absurd story."
4,spectacular effects,Pros:*Amazing Effects.*Good direction.*Creepy!*Bright and simple.*The T-Rex is awesome.Cons:*Jeff GoldblumBottom line:Entertaining.
5,WOW! HOLD ON TO YOUR SEAT!!!,"What an ADVENTURE!!! The special effects are so riveting, you forget to breathe until it's over!"
3,Good but disturbing for the light-hearted,"This was a very good movie, special effects were brilliant. The theme of the film would most definitely disturb the light hearted. I mean, dinosaurs jumping out and ripping the head of a man is not my favourite cup of tea anyway."
4,Cool movie to watch as a family,"We dimmed the lights, cranked up the volume, and watched this as a family on our 63 inch Samsung with surround sound. Fortunately a bathroom was nearby since after some scares I felt as if we had to do a pants-check."
4,Dinosaurs steal the show!,"I'm a big Steven Spielberg fan and I really like Jurrasic Park,but the dinosaurs definately upstage the human actors,in my opinion.Not that the actors don't do a good job,but it was amazing to just sit there and watch those dinosaurs.CGI effects,while extremely common now,weren't used as often before this film came out,(some films that had used them extensively were The Abyss,and Terminator 2)and the dinosaurs looked unbelievably real.(at least as far as I know,I never actually saw a real dinosaur!)Overall,this movie is very entertaining,(and better than it's sequal The Lost World)and it's got a good John Williams score,and most people would probably enjoy it.(although there probably aren't a lot of people who haven't seen it!)"
3,Who cares about plot?,"Admittedly, this is a spfx bonanza. That alone warrants multiple viewings. However, as is typical of Big Ole Hollywood, the story is severely disabled. Either watering down or altogether trashing the darker, more intellectual elements of the source novel, JP instead plays it safe. Sure, it is tense, exciting and involving but, did anyone else walk out of the theatre feeling empty? Did anyone else feel pandered to? As a dinosaur enthusiast, I have to recommend this film for its spectacular effects and its overall sense of fun and excitement. However, anyone seeking any depth or an exploration of thought-provoking ideas should look elsewhere. But, that's okay! Nobody cares about plot anyway, right? Just strap yourself in, shut off your brain and be pummelled into submission like a good little lamb. Everybody's doing it!"
3,"I wanna go to Jurassik Park, Can we go? Can we?","Old and excessively well off man creates the ultimate theme park on a far away island where the attractions are real live dinosaurs. But when he invites a team of theorists and his grandchildren to spend some time there, one of the employees shuts down the security holding the dinos in their places and they all escape and start killing people. Amazing special effects that bring the dinos to life and some good performances (especially from Goldblum) but unlike GREMLINS, the violence in this movie is way over the top. The chaos theory scene gives some of the surprise away. People who liked this movie should see CARNOSAUR. The two of them can't be THAT DIFFERENT!"
1,"Unless you have a tiny tv, don't buy the pan and scam versio","Buy the widescreen edition instead (unless your tv is really small, of course you should just buy the widescreen edition and get a larger tv in that case)."
1,Empty dinosaurs.,"In a fair world, this film would've been the biggest flop of Spielberg's career, but naturally it wasn't, because the timing was right. So what's wrong ?. The characters are boring, the story's boring, the whole thing is just one big disappointing bore. But why ?. Well, we came to see the creatures, didn't we ?. So where were they ?. The island should've been full of life, but you didn't get that feeling. It's almost like Spielberg's making fun of the audiences who flocked in hordes to the theaters; giving them suspense but no release. -Or a dino movie with no dinos. Neat. If they were so proud of their CGI effects, why didn't they show us more ?. -Ray Harryhausen at least gave you monster value for your money, with superb stop motion animation for all to SEE. I'd much rather watch good old stuff like ""King Kong"", or live lizards in ""Journey To The Center Of The Earth"", or even those rubber things in ""The Land That Time Forgot""."
1,Very dissapointing! Please DO NOT TAKE small children!,Very horrific- the book was fascinating...this is not... Very early on the movie captures the 'magic' and wonderment of the book...then looses it in poorly produces 'slasher film' techniques and 'lets see how bad we can scare you' nonsense. How sad....a tragicly flawed adaptation.
1,the terrible spielberg makes a terrible movie,boring with horrible characterizations. typical spielberg
2,"Good movie, but the tape went bad",I bought this edition a few years ago. Now I hear very strong hissing and static on the soundtrack. It almost seems like the tape is degrading or something. It's in a cabinet and not next to anything magnetic or hot or cold. Very weird.
3,A GOOD MOVIE BUT THE BOOK WAS A LOT BETTER,I liked JURRASIC PARK the movie but I found myself wanting more and here's why. For instance even though the effects are great espically the T-REX and VELICORAPTORS I felt that STEVEN SPEILBERG did'nt use enough from the novel JURASSIC PARK which was great. I felt that there was too much that was removed by SPEILBERG that was in the book tthat he did'nt use in the movie don't get me wrong there are some parts in the movie that are suspensful and exciting but I still felt like I wanted more after watching this film. One I would not recommend this film for younger kids it is just too scary. My final thoughts are if you haven't read JURRASIC PARK the novel by MICHEAL CRICHTON you'll love the movie but if you have read the novel you might be a little dissappointed like I was.
2,"Good effects, a good jolt, no point","Good special effects and at least one of the most frightening things in cinema are the highlights of this movie. Alas, a decent script and any kind of idea beyond making lots of money are not.The film cannot face up to the true message that lies waiting in it's own story: that technology is a great danger that must be used responsibly. Making that movie would have put Spielberg in a serious bind: it would be a multi-million-dollar technologically state of the art movie about the dangers of multi-million dollar state of the art technology. So Spielberg adds some nonsense about the hero growing to love children(!!!!) to disguise the tidied up story.Fun, exciting, and totally devoid of content. That tyrannosaur is cool, though...."
5,381 min...? 3D.......? Super long Special Ext.....?,Wowww I must have that unless they made an very Big / Long mistake....? 3 Discs....? Maybe all three Movies .....?
4,dinosaurs were an obvious monster movie target!,"This movie is brilliant! The effects are amazing, suspense is professionally done, the dinosaurs a virtually real, a corker!!It's about some people who are invited to a theme park full of cloned, brought-back-to-life dinosaurs. But when they get trapped in the park with the dinosaurs, and the body count rises, they must find a way out before they are dino droppings!!!I liked this movie because the acting is well done, and the dinosaurs look sooooo real you wouldn't believe!!! Speilberg really showed what he was capable of, though he was better in the notorious JAWS! The only bad thing about the film is the science. Some dino's are too big, some too small, and some plainly overexagerated. Most of the science is made up and fake.But apart from that, a fantastic movie, worth the watch!!!"
3,Jurassic park and the lost world DVD,"On a DVD you expect to see ""more"" image then on a VHS tape because it is ""widescreen"". Usually this is the case, but on these 2 DVD's you see much less then on the tape. What they did here what cutting off the top and bottom parts off what you see on the tape and call this ""widescreen"". So on this DVD you don't see the left, right, top and bottom parts of the original cinema version. In my opinion, these DVD's are a waste of money.Arie van der Spoel"
5,I AM LIVING IN JURASSIC PARK FOREVER,"THIS MOVIE HAVE A GRATEEST OF IMPACT ON MY WHOLE LIFE I DO NOT KNOW WHY ? FOR ME IT IS NOT A MOVIE IT IS A TRUE HOME FOR ME FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE I AM ALWAYS LIVING IN JURASSIC PARK ,I CAN NOT IMAGINE MY LIFE WITH OUT JURASSIC PARK I.. HAVE NO WORDS TO SAY ..........................JUST DIVINE EXPERIANCE FOR MANY MANY LIFES TO COME"
3,jarassic park,i like this one still but i only give it 3 stars because it just doesnt get me super interested it doesnt have much thrill in it but its still a good movie i compared it with the 2nd i think the second is better but still its a great movie if you bought the second but didnt get the first you still have to get this one because you wont know what happened in the first one. but still if you think im saying its a bad movie really i think its still a good movie so you all that dont have this should buy it.
5,Jurassic Park a Modern Day Classic,"After hearing her brother boast of this movie, my youngest daughter has now become of the age that she could watch it.And she was on the edge of her seat the whole time. This is the best dinosaur movie ever!My family love, love loves Jurassic Park!"
4,"Great visuals, no grey matter","Perhaps it is wrong to judge a movie by the book that inspired it, but in this case it is necessary. I have seen some movie adaptations that stray 'some what' from the original source material but this is ridiculous.In short, about the only thing the two have in common is the names of the characters and the fact that there are dinosaurs in both of them. The characterizations are all different. The relationships are different. And any minor characters who died in the book lived in the movie, and vice versa.However the movie is good for what it is, a special effects showcase that highlights the moment when computers completely took over the effects business. It was an evolutionary step that originated with TRON, had it's adolescence in the Abyss and Terminator 2, and came to complete maturity with that Brachiosaur walking in front of Sam Niell and company."
3,An Average Film.,"I remember seeing this film when it was first released in the theaters a few years ago. It was interesting to a degree, but not a classic. The creature effects no doubt were very good, but Jurassic Park is still just an average film."
3,"Great Sound, Lousy Video Transfer","I am VERY disappointed with the quality of the video transfer on this 'Collector's Edition.' Yes the sound DTS sound is great, but the poor quality video transfer is just flat-out terrible on my progressive scan television. It's not my hardware - most of the movies I own look terrific in 480p.Grainy and pixilated, the transfer quality looks more like an Asian VCD knockoff. By far the worst looking in my collection. If you're collecting DTS versions, by all means get it, but be prepared for a less than stellar video performance."
3,Pandering to Special Effects,"Steven Spielberg masterfully conveyed primeval terror in his 1993 mega-hit, Jurassic Park. Fortunetly, I read the Michael Crichton's novel in anticipation of seeing the movie. If Steven Spielberg's rendition is also among his weakest stories, it is because he did not remain true to the Michael Crichton novel -- a masterfully told story of mankind's *real* terror: human greed."
5,Welcome To Jurassic Park,Steven Speilberg dose it again. he directed a terrific movie that know one will forget. this has to be his best movie since e.t. i love this movie and so will you. recommend it for everyone
5,Spectacular Movie and Extra Features,"This is a great DVD for the Jurassic Park fans. In the first place, you get the movie in its original wide-screen format. What makes it really rock is the bonus footage, including a couple of very well-filmed and informative episodes on the making of Jurassic Park. I had almost as much fun watching these documentaries as I did the feature movie itself."
4,Good times.,"This movie is so dear to me. Its one of those films where every couple of years you just feel like seeing. For all who don't know jurassic park is about really rich man that funds a science team that finds out how to make dinosaurs. He plans to open a theme park, the worlds most successful one, so he gets two archaeologists to ok the park for him or teach the other people about dinosaurs what they eat, what the can't eat etc. But then every thing goes wrong (the good part). The dinosaurs go lose and on a killing spree....oh yea. If you want to hear more then i guess i just sold a movie."
2,ORIGINAL ?,"I Keep reading how original this concept was,It's west World with dynosaurs.typical Spielberg mind candy."
2,"Great Movie, AWFUL SOUND","DTS? Not really. Normally, DTS shows great care in encoding and overall has amazing sound quality. The sound quality on this DVD is preposterously bad - it does not deserve to carry the label DTS. It sounds like a poorly-done Dolby 5.1 soundtrack! It has no umph, the surround is used to sparringly and obviously, and the dialogue is obviously dubbed.An otherwise great DVD is ruined by awful sound. Buy the regular collector's edition: I'm sure the sound is about the same."
3,Slightly overratted (sorry),"A guy builds a theme park, brings dinosaurs back to life, and the dinos get loose and eat people. Pretty good, but it gets a little boring after you watch it a few times. Good special effects, though. Certanly not a bad movie."
5,"If I could give it 6 stars, I would!","This is my favorite movie of all time. No other dinosaur movie quite matches Jurassic Park. Combined with Spielberg's fresh and ingenious plot and script, along with the wonderful acting (and/or scream antics:)) of Sam Neill and Laura Dern (the main characters, Dr. Grant and Dr. Sattler), and the incredible CGI techniques for the dinosaurs, this movie comes alive with realistic settings and edge-of-your-seat surprises. I haven't yet seen numbers 2 or 3 of the movie, and I'm sure they won't quite match the 1st. Please buy this movie if you haven't already. I guarantee that it'll be worth all the money!"
2,Hasn't this been done before??,"Jurassic Park is at best just another 'monster'movie,this format is getting very tired. Ya is has excelent graphics and a John Williams sound track,what it doesn't have is any soul to it,the old ""King Kong"" movie for all is primitve effects out shines JP,it my friends has a story to tell and it tells it with heart."
5,Grand.,"This was always one of my favorite movies. It has now been released as a collector's edition DVD. This DVD contains some great bonus features, about half of which I have actually watched. As should be expected of any movie labeled ""special edition"", the sound quality is superb and the picture has been remastered. They didn't just say that, you can tell. This is an amazing version of a modern classic and it's probably the best version you're ever going to find. On the other hand, you could always get the whole trilogy box set but, the picture quality is a bit better on this. If you have not read the original book, read it. You'll thank me later."
4,A Dino-Sized Problem,"Jurassic Park, directed by Steven Spielberg, is an excellent thriller. Dinosaurs escape from their restrictions in a new amusement park. It's a life threatening ordeal as a group of people try to escape the island with their lives. Finding traitors in their group, only the smartest will servive. Watch the movie to find out more."
5,AN AWESOME ACTION THRILLER!,"Man this movie is intense. It is soo great. At the time, it had to be the best movie of the year. Spielberg really mad a classic out of that movie. Now it is an 8 year old movie. In the movie it shows how scientest fickle around with dino DNA, and frog DNA to create...Dinosaurs. It might seem as if everything is going right at firtst, but the senario of the movie is changed. The big turning point of this flick is when the power shuts down, and the dino's start exscaping. Not good. SO get up and go rent this and you will see that it is a wonderful movie. Also in 1998 ,i think, spielberg brought Jurasic Park back with ""The Lost World"" (a sequal to Jurasic Park). Now this movie wasn't nearly as awesome as the first. But it still was a good movie. Just the people actually new what they were up against, they were prepared, but in the first they were not as prepared and that is what makes it so intense. So go watch this and enjoy it."
4,Very good but could have been scarier.,"Very good movie and though I usually don't care all that much for scary movies I though that Jurassic Park could have been scarier with a lot more scary scenes with the dinosaurs. Sam Neil, Jeff Goldblum and Laura Dern were great and I thought the girl who played the granddaughter of the owner of the park was good too, I'm not sure what her name is but I think it's Ariana Richards."
2,"Good FX, but not much more","They've finally come up with something better than claymation, ok. Beyond that, nada mucho. Annoyingly ""cute"" kids, dottie old eccentric billionaire grandpaps, dependable scientists, entropy; reads like a cheaper thriller. Leaves behind many of the elements that made Crighton's novel effective. But it's Spielberg, so it must be good, right?"
4,good to deal with,"I got the item in a timely manner and it came as advertised. All in all, pretty happy. It had a little more wear than I expected but it plays well and that's what matters!"
3,"Movie:Awesome,Picture Quality:Not so good",Picture quality is not appreciative even with the player with DVD upscaling. It's better to go for a bluray disc instead.
3,OK movie,"This movie is alright, but it lacks a lot of stuff. The script it messed up, the story's confusing, etc. Another disappointing feature about this movie is the seems-like-forever T-rex pen attack. I skipped through the whole thing. The extra 2 stars are for the action and the special effects. The movie has some pretty wild action sequences, some of the most unique I've seen. The special effects are also great, considering the fact that you don't know which are special effects and which aren't. Overall, this isn't a horrible movie; it's okay but needs a little work."
3,way better than 2 and almost topped 1,a very good movie and the film wasn't all that long that is the amazing part it never got really boring u only had 2 wait a few mintues before something big happened that is how most movies should be like i think this is one of the best films of 2001 if not the best jp 3 was filled with action and
5,"Jurassic one of, if not the best movie ever made.","Jurassic Park is a great all around movie. It has invented a whole race of fx for current movie hits ""The Matrix"" ""Star Wars"" and so on. Perhaps the DTS 5.1 channel sound that you enjoy at the movies is the biggest impact. Now,the movie, it is so real! The T-rexs and the raptors are so scary. People say it has a bad plot and it's basic, yeah, they probaly didn't even know what DNA or cloning was. I mean this movie came out before they cloned an animal! Michael Crichton is a genius! Also what about The Lost World the only reason people gave it bad reviews is because they thought it was going to be as good as JP.Tell me how many movies as good as JP are going to come within 20 years of each other? If I could I'd give JP 100 stars! Thank you Steven for making a great movie!"
3,Pretty much over it.,"Jurassic Park was a huge and successful movie when it was released in 1993 and I just a little kid back then but watching this blockbuster now, well this film has lost its luster and excitment. I really cannot watch this film ever again, it looks so cheap and silly now, Steven Spielberg's directing is overrated even to this day. The only character that is still funny to me is Jeff Goldblum. A lot of people may see this movie as an oldie but goodie but sorry to say I don't feel the same."
5,Greatest Movie of All Time,"This movie is spieldbergs greatest masterpiece. While Schindlers List may be his best movie on story, this is far better. The story is very simple and with a movie about dinosaurs rampaging how complex could it be in the first place? The effect may not be as overwhelming on the small screen, but considering the power of this movie it shouldnt take long before you are engulfed in it. This is in no means a classic based on deep and riveting story line like the above mentioned schindlers list. It is more of a classic because of the extremely high entertainment factor based of effects, and the fear that is conveyed from the actors to you. I remember when this first came out I was about 9 and I saw it 24 times in the movies(seriously), and it still hasn't lost any of it's magic."
2,The Dinosaurs will roar on your screen.,"Some films should really be seen in a movie theater or drive-in. Jurassic Park (1993) and the following sequels, The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997), Jurassic Park III (2001) should be.We all became accustomed to Dinosaurs by watching the Godzilla film series, the original NBC, Land Of The Lost (1974-77),One Million Years B.C.(1966), The Flintstones cartoon series (1960-66) or even visited the Los Angeles La brea Tar Bits.I won't give away any of the story, but you do have an all-star cast: Sam Neill, Laura Dern, Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough, B.D. Wong, Wayne Knight, Joseph Mazzello and Ariana Richards.The dinosaurs may be way too frightening for young children.My suggestion is to buyLand of the Lost: Season 1(1974), starring Spencer Milligan, Wesley Eure and Kathy Coleman.Update: Jurassic Park IV will be released June 13, 2014."
1,Stupid Skipped half the Movie,The movie was brand new new when I got it and it was scratched and skipped the middle half of the movie.
2,Collectors Edition?,"I give the movie itself a huge 5, but the Collector's Edition DVD a 2. I was disappointed as soon as I opened it. It had a space for one of those paper inserts, but there was nothing there. What kind of a collector's edition is this? In any case, I'm very glad I have the DVD, because I have watched my VHS copy about 200 times. Jurassic Park is my favorite movie of all time and I would encourage you to buy it!"
3,"""Boy, do I hate being right all the time.""","Jurassic Park genetically splices the fairy tale of The Sorceror's Apprentice with the modern Godzilla myth. Science, from this film's angle, is a form of modern-day magic that destroys all who try to employ it for personal gain. The invisible hand behind the drama --- and this is a drama --- is Chaos Theory: Newest god in the scientific pantheon. Predictions of imminent collapse made by the chaotician (deftly portrayed by Jeff Goldblum) rapidly manifest in just one afternoon: ""Boy, do I hate being right all the time"".At its release, Jurassic Park was a dream-come-true for children. I would have loved to see this film as a child - no doubt being frightened for days after. Fortunately, I was able to watch it with my nine-year-old son, which in retrospect was even better.A dark but overall upbeat roller-coaster."
4,Jurassic Park Just Dinosaurs,"Jurassic is fun to see but all it seemed to be is dinosaurs to see. The characters weren't developed, which was sad, but it was so entertaining that it really quite made up for it. Umm, for example: Ian Malcom had to have a sequel to show any sign of a character. But it was still good."
4,Enjoyable escapist romp,"Jurassic Park has come under many criticisms and many adulations since it's release. Main areas of upset over the movie cover everything from lack of plot, not adhering to the original book, being a Crichton movie (his plots all generally involve the same theme - watch WestWorld) and generally being sold on graphics rather than anyhting else.I'm not going to argue any of these points. They are all valid, and they all have some worth.However, I do believe that in essence, the movie is well intentioned. The idea was to utilise computer generation graphics to bring us dinosaurs - which it has achieved. The plot is sturdy enough to support this original premise, and the action enables us to watch the slick work without, on occasions, even realising the non-existance of the creatures.If you can accept that original premise, and realise that you are not going to get 100% accurate dinosaur behaviour (as if we could tell...) then this movie is definitely worth a watch."
3,Batman tri-fold walllet,It is a cute wallet; my son loves it. But it does not have a zipper compartment for change. I think that the product description should mention those kinds of details.
5,One of Laswell's best,"Dark, ambient, Trancy, exciting...what more can I say...one of my favorite CD's after 2 years of listening."
4,I have never forgotten this book in 15 years,"If anyone ever speaks of a nuclear winter or post-apocalyptic holocausts, images from this book still float to mind. Hiding under the table cloth, the hit of the nuclear blast, the destroyed suburbia, survivors mutating under the harsh new sunlight, roaming a transformed world. This book became a part of my psyche as soon as I read it.After rereading, I tend to think of this more fondly than John Wyndam's The Chrysalids, though they both focus on holocaust worlds from the perspective of children. This books children you relate to from the beginning and you are continually amazed at the path they travel. Wheras Wyndam's children are always outsiders, always The Other.For a seasoned sci-fi fan there will be nothing new here, but if you want to get a 12 year old girl intrigued in the world of sci-fi, this very emotive, well written book is a sure thing."
1,UGH! GAVE ME NIGHTMARES FOR YEARS!,I had to read this book when I was about 10 years old for school - and it resulted in me deveolping Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) because it terrified me so badly. A good book and a wonderful warning about the dangers of nuclear power and warfare - but for god's sake don't read it until you're at least 18 or so!
5,MY GO-TO STICK!,"These are excellent sticks. I've been through many pairs and settled on Ahead sticks for their durability and shock resistance. However, the tips kept unscrewing leading to gashed heads and the grip area is limited. Enter the Pro-Mark oak! I loved the balance and feel of the hickory 747's but, they didn't last long. I went on a whim with these and it was love at first swing! They have the volume and durability of an Ahead with the balanced feel. I suggest taking your favorite style of whatever stick you're using and try it in the oak. I've tried several and keep coming back to the 747N. My only wish is that they reissue the oak natural finish series(Also a fantastic series if you prefer hickory). If you're looking for a stick that hits harder and lasts longer, go for these!"
3,Shedding new light on American Symphonic Music,"This recording allows for new listeners to appreciate the contributions of American composers to the furhter development of program music or what is called symphonic/tone poems. The US Library of Congress issued this recording of pices first recorded in 1958 but never released. Through technical expertise, everything has been updated and the beauty of MacDowell's music shines through, particulary in Hamlet/Ophelia (Tracks 3&4). Excellent booklet notes give a good overview of each poems composition. Recommended for people who enjoy the tone poems of R. Strauss and Franz Liszt."
4,Forgotten Americana,"MacDowell was highly regarded in his day, but now is known for a few piano pieces and his second piano conerto, which occasionally turns up. Andre Watts and Van Cliburn among others have championed it.MacDowell was a very accomplished composer in a post-Lisztian/pre-Impressionistic vein. These compositions lack only melodic memorability to make them staples of the repertory.These are old recordings from the 1960's made fresh as new by great restoration. Karl Krueger provides strong advocacy ably backed by the great Royal Philharmonic of London in its heyday. Well worth a hearing.Bravo Bridge for rescuing them from the attic."
5,"Underrated 2nd Damned album is full of good, fierce punk","The first Damned album, 'Damned Damned Damned' is considered a classic punk rock album and rightly so. What I can't figure out is why their second album, 'Music for Pleasure', doesn't get the same treatment. Their songs are just as raw and ferocious on this disc as on the first one. Brion James hasn't left the group yet, and they're nowhere near the 'goth' sound they got into later. This is great late-70s punk rock, which any fan of the Sex Pistols, Clash, Dictators, Heartbreakers, Saints, Ramones, and of course the Damned should own. ""Problem Child"", ""One Way Love"", ""Don't Cry Wolf"" are top notch, but every song is solid. Twenty plus years later, and it still will annoy your parents."
4,A Damned Parable,"In retrospect this album is quite good, but if anything I agree that it's the Damned's most Americanized release; coming off like BACK IN THE USA MC5 and TOO MUCH TO SOON New York Dolls having a knife fight in an alley...errr... onstage during a Bowery production of WEST SIDE STORY. That is; killer guitar, plenty attitude; but only raw in a very premeditated way. Everything is so clean and separated it's like Nick Mason worked out the distance between the guys in the studio with a tape measure and a protractor; there's no real meshing of the sound into a solid whole. The emasculating production buffs a few too many edges off and it often slips into sounding hollow; like a staged knife fight as opposed to a real one. On top of that, ""Idiot Box,"" ""Your Eyes"" and ""You Know"" definitely have their own merits, but interrupt the flow of an album that needed to just bash ahead full steam."
5,Great for new parents,"I've been reading aloud to my eldest child for seven years, but I still learned a lot from reading this book. This is a great gift for a new parent. Forget the little baby clothes. Parents can use this book for many years."
5,What an incredible resource,This is an invaluable resource for reading to your children. The list of books at the end is very well laid out and has really opened the door to some of the books my children will hopefully love for a lifetime.
5,Extraordinary Performance,"Cecilia Bartoli has given the universe one of the most spectacular performances of the century and we are indeed fortunate to have a recording of it to enjoy time and time again. She is in top vocal form and her artistry and dramatic powers shine with every note. Every mood is expertly communicated, even if more strongly than sometimes expected...Vivaldi' Gelido in ogni vena from his opera Farnace will simply leave you breathless............. and most probably in tears."
4,Fantastic Yoga DVD,This dvd offers a very well rounded yoga practice for beginner + enthusiasts. After 2 years of yoga I found Baron's cuing and approach enabled me to begin mastering the balancing poses. Good warm up and flow holding the poses for an appropriate length of time. The 70 minutes goes by very quickly.
2,Too much chit-chat,"All I could think about during this video was ""Is he ever going to be quiet and why does he repeat everything he says twice?"" Verbal instruction is good, but at times Baron sounded corny and very ""fitness"" motivated. If you are just looking for a workout, then I guess this wouldn't be bad, but if you are searching for a video that goes beyond a workout then don't look here. Don't get me wrong, I admire Baron's attempts to bring yoga to the mainstream, but this video doesn't stand out and doesn't offer anything different than the other ""Power Yoga"" videos out there. In fact, during the middle of the video I began to wonder if I was in a Bikram class! The balancing sequence was exactly the same, pose for pose. So in the end, if you asked me if I would recommend this video the answer would be no. But what do I know? Try it for yourself and then you be the judge."
1,Not his best,"I was very dissappointed with this tape, this was not the power yoga I was looking for. Pretty boring, sorry."
3,Really 2.5 stars--because he never shuts up,"I needed a yoga dvd quick and grabbed this one, without investigating him. While I do feel peaceful after, and stronger, I would've felt more peaceful if he was quieter. He chatters nonstop, even during the corpse posture! Everything constantly goes back to the Sun Salutation constantly. Some of the asanas are too easy, and some too hard. While he does tell you there are variations, they are never demonstrated, so you can only imagine. He also calls plank asana ""the push-up position."" He does not even demonstrate the asanas, but tells a group of fit, slim Yoga students (and occasionally adjusting them) while walking around in just white shorts. He also claps often to signal that the position is over. While it is a decent workout, I have a feeling that after owning this DVD for a while, it will sit on my shelf for only occasional use."
2,old class style video,"i absolutley love baron baptiste power yoga. i didn't like this particular video at all, though. this is formatted like an old style workout where everyone is dressed the same and very conforming. i much prefer the more recent videos where it is more like a true class you would attend. i will definately stick to my other 3 videos i have of his!"
3,Original?,"What most people believe to be the original is NOT. Kermit the frog was NOT in the original which was released on HBO in 1977. For whatever reason, when network TV got ahold of it to air it, it was seriously altered. The version with Kermit the frog was a remix or whatever you wish to call it and unfortunately is the one most people recognize. Myself, I saw the original and was not happy to see Kermit appear in the remixed/remade version."
5,Wonderful Memories,"I was elated and overjoyed when my son (26 yrs. old) told me he saw this DVD on Amazon! This used to play on t.v. when my children (all over 20 now) were small. They loved it then, and so did I. We played it every Christmas, several times. I had recorded it, but it didn't come out very good. (We had an old recorder then). So, years had gone by since any of us had seen it again. This was such a ""treat"" to have back. I ordered one right away, as well as one for my sister, as she had enjoyed it with her children, too! When I showed my daughter (28 yrs. old), she wanted one, too! So, I got another one. After all these many years, I still remembered most of the words to the songs. I absolutely LOVE it! Thanks for bringing it back and having it on your website for sale! You helped make our Christmas that much happier!"
4,Very Pleased,This poduct came faster than qouted with the sellers very knowledgable about the whole process..... i would recommend these people to anyone.. Thanks again
5,Emmett Otter,Loved this movie growing up. Wanted to pass down the memories. Just as good on DVD. GREAT FAMILY FILM FOR GENETATIONS TO COME.
4,Emmet Otters Jugband Christmas,"Emmet Otter's Jug-Band ChristmasIt was in great shape and the movie is fantastic.My little one loves it. ;)Thank You,Sharon"
5,Christmas memories,it brought back memories form childhood for my 40 year old daughter. I would reccomend it to parents everywhere. Not enough childhood entertainment without violence on t.v. today. It is nothing but pure enterainment
5,Great flashback for my wife...,It was a birthday gift for my wife. We love Jim Hensen's Muppets and this is my wife's favorite childhood memory... Definitely recommend if you haven't seen it. Especially if you or your children enjoy woodland critters.
4,Prime,"Had wished it was available in BluRay, but I guess not. Fast ship by prime!!BlueRay would have pushed this to 5 stars"
2,These reviewers have been drinking too much eggnog,"When the movie started Emmet and his mother were singing about their grandmother's bathing suit. I thought, ""Well, the reviews were really good, so it must get better."" It didn't. That was the best part of the movie. This movie was seriously disappointing. I love the Muppets, but the story line is poor and the singing is mediocre. You should go to iTunes and watch the preview of the movie. If you like the preview you will like the movie. I would suggest you move on to a holiday movie. You won't have to go far."
4,Kermit?,Does this DVD include the Kermit intro/ending and is it the complete movie or the same as the 2005 release?
1,Emmitt Otters Jug band Christmas,the DVD skips and brought this to the sellers attention- and i have heard nothing
1,Waiting over a month,Ordered on 12/12/08 for a Cmas gift. As of 1/12/09 I still have not received this item.
3,not sure,Okay I am not sure what to think of this. My husband could not wait for us to get this; every time he went to Walmart to get it; it would be sold out. And I don't see why this would be sold out!!! He and our daughter have watched this a couple of times...I have watched very little & could careless to watch the whole thing.Each to their own!!!
5,Christmas Classic,I remember enjoying this movie as a child and was pleased to find that my children enjoyed it as much as I did. I started singing along to several of the songs! This is a great movie for kids ages 5-10.
5,Ok so which do I buy???? Please Help!,"Okay so I was born in 78, grew up watching this on HBO during the 80's. Apparently there are a few versions out right now. Which one would I connect with most? Which should I buy? Thanks."
5,wow!,"So glad i found this, made my Christmas! I never see this on tv and my kids even remembered watching it too. Made us all very happy!"
5,Very Pleased,"I'm happy to see one of my childhood Christmas movies on newer technology (DVD). I owned this on VHS and don't have a VCR anymore, so I was glad to find it on DVD. The bonus features (outtakes, songs, interviews) are nice, but the movie itself was the reason for purchasing."
4,Classic Muppets!,I saw this as a kid and loved it! I am still waiting to see that River Bottom Band go on tour!
2,Do your research before you buy; Kermit's still not here.,"This is another one of those times when doing some reseach before purchasing is a good thing. Once I saw the new cover art on this title, I mistakenly assumed that it must be a revised version of this classic TV special with the ""Kermit"" scenes restored. What it turned out to be is a case of misleading packaging. Yes, there is new cover art, but it's only on the cardboard slipcase over the DVD. Once you remove it, you find that the artwork on the actual DVD box underneath is from the 2005 release. In fact, that's what this disc actually is; it is EXACTLY the same as the 2005 edition, no more no less."
4,Fantastically fun for all ages!!!,"Awe the Muppets! A fantastic display of Christmas cheer from a source that I've known, and respected, since I was small enough to be a Muppet. Great plot and hilarious characters that make this journey fun for all whom are young (and young at heart)!"
4,4 stars from the wife and kid,"Apparently some people grew up on this Henson creation, somehow I missed out on it...while it makes me want to slam my head into the wall my 4 year old LOVES it!"
4,Cute,I bought this for my son. He loved watching this every Christmas and now he shares this with his granddaughter.
5,Great movie!,"I bought this movie on a recommendation. It is such a funny movie and my kids loved it the 1st time we watched it, even though it isn't made from modern day movie making cameras and props. This movie helps remind us what the Christmas holiday is truly about!!"
5,emmet otter and the junkyard band christmas,My kids loved it when they were younger. So I got it for my grandkids. My love it It was amazing how ahead of times they were.
5,Still as good as I remember,"My wife and qI bought this as a VHS tape many years ago, and my children adored it......... This was bought as a DVD for one of my children to give as a Christmas gift for one of her nieces, and It's still a family favorite!!"
1,Disappointing but still fun.,"I purchased this from Amazon.com and received it in a very timely manner. I remember the show when it came out on HBO and was happy to add it to my many memories on years gone by. When I ordered it again, I am thinking that my mind was gentler or more critical of the show. I disappointed myself but am happy to know that this is the precursor to the original Muppets. So even though my mind had saved memories of this show in a kind way, I will add it to my collection and watch to try and remember why I thought it was good at the time."
4,gift,My daughter-in-law was saying how she grew up watching this video every Christmas. I bought it for her and she was thrilled. I have not seen it but she was very happy to get it as a gift.
5,Oldie but Good,"This movie is rather old in comparison to now, but it is awesome. I love the meanings behind it and it is a movie my late grandmother and I used to watch every Christmas Eve as tradition. I got it again as a tradition for my kids and I. I love it, it makes me feel like my grandmother is close."
4,Reviewing this item ages me!,"This movie is a Christmas legend at our house! My siblings and I anxiously awaited the watching of this movie every Christmas as a child; the last few years we have passed the worn VHS copy from our parents house between our own homes, so I was thrilled to order my own copy on DVD. Watching it 20 years later it has lost some of the magic it held during childhood, but still a Christmas classic. One of my other favorite Christmas movies that often goes unnoticed is ""One Magic Christmas"" starring Mary Steenburgen."
5,Emmet Otter,"My daughter would not consider it Christmas until she has watched this movie. I am purchasing the DVD because I have an old copy vhs which I taped when the show was aired on TV and it has seen better days. This is a wonderful movie with a great ending, everyone deserves a chance to see it."
4,Great Christmas Time Movie for the Kids,I used to watch this movie every year growing up. I was so happy to find it on DVD. I plan to make it a renewed Christmas time tradition.
2,"not the original, unedited version but still enjoyable","This is not the original, full version that featured Kermit the Frog as narrator. It is edited, with some lines being cut from the show as well as full scenes. Even some of the songs are edited or shortened. I hope the full, unedited version of this classic show will be released soon. My rating is due to this not being the full version. The program itself is still as enjoyable as ever but would be much more enjoyable if it wasn't edited."
3,Special Edition - But still not good.,"I have the first DVD version of Emmet Otter's JugBand Xmas. The one with Ma's comment to Gretchen Fox taken out. I am assuming this will have that scene back in.... It will also have a ""New Lost Song"". But THIS TIME they are going to be cutting out the Kermit the Frog scenes!!! I think I will keep my current 'butchered' copy, instead of getting a second 'butchered' copy. Maybe one day it and a Muppet Family Christmas can be released properly, but I am not holding my breath."
4,LOVED IT BUT....,"LOVED IT A LOT. HOWEVER OF COURSE JUST LIKE ALL THE HENSON CLASSICS THIS ONE IS EDITED DUE TO CONFLICTING COPYRIGHTS, DISNEY OWNS KERMIT AND THE MUPPETS SO ALL THE KERMIT STUFF IS CUT OUT ENTIRELY. MAYBE SOMEDAY DISNEY WILL WAKE UP AND EITHER BUY ALL THE OTHER HENSON STUFF OR ALLOW THE CAMEO ROLES OF THE MUPPETS TO BE DISTRIBUTED ALONG WITH THE OTHER HENSON CLASSICS THE WAY THEY WERE ORIGINALLY INTENDED."
4,Great for memories but missing that something extra....,"Great DVD version of the show but its missing the introduction from Kermit that was on the original program. The ""out-take"" section is SUPER FUNNY and made me laugh out loud. You've never seen muppets get frustrated with filming before!"
5,"""Late Bloomer"" just loves this movie! :)","A girlfriend invited me to her house to watch this movie...I was skeptical, I have to say! LOL WOW...I really missed out growing up! Emmet Otter's Jug Band Christmas is a wonderful trip down memory lane back to the 70's and movies like ""Rudolph"" and ""Frosty the Snowman""!Even kids today are enjoying it, and it's good wholesome viewing for the entire family! I would highly recommend that you purchase this DVD.p.s. I just bought this as a birthday gift for my friend...her VHS copy was falling apart, so I hope she loves it! :)"
1,Bad Edited DVD!,I can't believe that Disney ruined another Muppett Christmas special. They ruined the DVD release for A Muppet Family Christmas and cut out several scenes and now they do the smae thing for Emmett Otter's Jug Band Christmas and totally eliminate the scenes with Kermet the Frog. That totally stinks!
4,"Ok, Ok, Kermit is gone, but it's still good!","I also remember this movie from my childhood, and was disappointed to see Kermit had to go for whatever bizarre commercial reasons they came up with. Enough of that.If this was the only version of this I'd ever seen, I'd still like it. My kids (3&4) like it, and it's a nice feel-good movie without too much energy that's good for before bed. Songs are good, story is cute, and the kids watch it to give me a break from Frosty."
4,"Kermit or no Kermit, I had to have this movie","As a young girl, one of my fondest memories was watching this movie with my family during the holidays. I watched it every time it was shown on HBO. After having my son I wanted to share this story with him. It is a wonderful story about giving of yourself, which is a lesson everyone needs to learn. I went so far as to send a copy to my mother so she could relive the fond memories of past Christmases and have new ones of sharing this with her grandchildren."
4,Greatly Satisfied,"I highly enjoyed watching this childhood favorite and was pleased with the overall quality of the DVD. I even loved the extras included, especially the sing-a-long! It was a good purchase at a great price."
5,holiday magic,"I LEARNED TO LOVE THIS WHEN MY CHILDREN WERE SMALL ON VHS. NOW THAT THEY ARE GROWN, THEY ASKED FOR NEW DVD COPIES OF THEIR OWN. THEY WILL GO FAR WITH GRANDCHILDREN TOO."
4,A Classic! A Very Sweet Christmas Video,This is a classic muppet video. I never saw it before and my sister (52) and myself (53) got a big kick out of it. Pretty short(hour-ish maybe?)--which should be great for the kids. very funny and very clever.
5,great christmas,"great movie, i have not seen it since i was a kid. i'm so glad it's on dvd.thank you very much."
5,Great Old Movie,Remember this from way back and it's even better now than before! Just cute characters and good music - fantastic.
5,Childhood favorite,Loved this as a kid and wanted my kids to view it. So happy it is available as a DVD. The quality of the movie was exceptional and it was delivered before Christmas.
1,Bad release of the greatest Christmas Special ever.,"I don't go for edited versions. Put Kermit back in and the other cut scenes and I'll buy it.Between A Christmas Story and Emmet Otter's Jug Band Christmas, I can't decide what is a better x-mas movie."
2,Emmet,This is not the product I received. I ordered and paid for this and got the $11.00 video. I emailed the company and they appologized and told me to send it back. I did not receive it until Christmas eve and it was a present for a special somebody that talked about it all the tiem. I gave what I received instead of what I paid for.
1,Crap.,"I love Emmett Otter, and was thrilled to find it. I am not, however, thrilled at receiveing a faulty disc that I can't return. Quality control missed the boat on this one."
4,One of my childhood favorites,I remember this video from when I was a child. It's nice to see that it is available on DVD. I loved it then and still do.
4,Good Christmas DVD,"Grandkids loved it, maybe more so when they are a little older.Good quality muppet DVD. Worthwhile for the proper age group."
4,A nice package,"Although not as stunning as the now out of print Julie is Her Name/Volume 2 on Liberty/EMI, this is a nice presentation of her her post 1957 work. There's a lot more orchestra tracks, fine for those who like that sort of thing, and few of the intimate two piece combo arrangements (featuring the sublime Barney Kessel) that characterized her first two LP's. Still, it's a cracking good listen, with You And The Night And The Music, Nightlife, and Nice Girls Don't Stay For Breakfast. If you don't want to spring for the individual albums, most of which are available, this is a fine compilation"
5,S-E-X Appeal,"Yeah, pals and gals, Julie didn't have the range of Ella, but she brought sexiness to the table . . . in double doses. While Doris Day made a career out of being the ""eternal virgin,"" Julie didn't even start recording until after she had kids! Once you hear her sultry, throaty voice on these tunes, you'll never forget it . . . and it will definitely put you ""in the mood for love."" This particular collection leaves out a few tunes (most notably, her signature ""Cry Me A River""), but the inclusion of some little gems like ""Nice Girls Don't Stay For Breakfast"" makes this collection a winner. So mix a shaker of martinis, put this on your player, turn the lights down and curl up with your sugar!"
5,For small ears,"I ordered this Garnet Stud Earrings 5mm for a gif, I really liked the color and quality of the stone; the earrings are small preferable for kids or an adult with small ears. Shipping was very fast. I paid $35.00 and I saw them next day of my purchase for 19.00 I could not cancel my order because it was already processed I was a little disappointed, no ones fault. ""Happy customer"""
4,"Not for everyone, but a good job","One of the least commercial projects I can imagine, but this CD contains some wonderful performances. Miller and Love harmonize beautifully, and their approach to the material is just right -- respectful, but with a feeling for the intent of the songs, whether it be humor or sorrow. In other words, they don't make fun of the music or camp it up, and they get some stellar results. Love's vocal on ""There Ain't No Ash Will Burn"" is particularly fine. If you want to hear something out of the mainstream, you might find yourself liking this music more than you want to admit."
3,Pear - Caramel?,This certainly isn't a bad tea but I just don't get the pear or caramel flavors from it. It has a very distinctive flavor and isn't unpleasant by any standards but it just isn't pear or caramel.
4,FULL OF ENERGY AND BLAZING SOLOS,"This is an awesome double disc showcase of Tommy Bolin's favorite band in concert. There is a major drawback though, the sound quality isn't the greatest. Yes, it's better than both of Bolin's 1976 concerts(Live @ Ebbet's and Under The Northern Lights), but not by much. The performance itself blows the above 2 shows away, Tommy jamming away at mostly blues and fusion classics. There aren't that many Bolin penned songs to begin with, I think the only one is Hok-A-Hoy. There may be one other too. It's a real treat hearing some earlier works like Whiskey Headed Woman, Lady Luck, Dreamer and Boogie Chillin' a few years before they became studio cuts and searing live staples. In all, a must own for dedicated Bolin fans only you have to bear with the fair to poor sound quality. LONG LIVE TOMMY BOLIN!"
3,Oneida Vectra Flatware,"I would like to give this a higher rating as I know the brand is excellent and this style is lovely, but the shipping stinks! I ordered it over a month ago and every week they delay the shipment AGAIN. It was supposed to be a Christmas gift and was ordered in plenty of time but it's now mid-January and it still hasn't shipped."
1,Self-serving and contradictory,I read this book in an attempt to understand the other side of the animal rights issue and came away frustrated by the lack of documentation and the completely contradictory nature of this book. The author states that he hunts because he loves animals but then makes it very clear that this love is based largely on greed and vanity. Too much paraphrasing and assumption with little or no documentation. This book was written for a specific audience of people already against animal rights.
1,"Complete, Utter Nonsense","Unfortunately, choosing ""negative 5"" stars wasn't available for this hilarious and barely readable drivel or I would have done so. The ridiculous statements in this book are too numerous to even attempt to correct. That would literally require rewriting the book sentence by sentence. However, I laughed at how on the very first page, the reader is told that the author was once the target of an assissination (sic!). Indeed. However, he fittingly offers not a shread of evidence that this ever took place, courtesy of the Manson followers or anyone else. We're just supposed to take the author's, um, word for it. Yeah, okay, sure.<P"
1,Shame to society,"A person who gets his jollies on harming a living breathing feeling creature would not think twice before harming you. Believe it. The authors of this book might as well be wrighting an editorial to a newspaper. Nothing here is based on fact or even trys to agrue their cause. They point fingers and make broad accusations throught the book. If you want an unbiased oppinion, think for yourself."
1,Save your money,"This book is a great disappointment. If you are looking for first person tales of experiences as a flying cadet during World War II, look elsewhere. The book should more accurately be titled ""Flying Cadets of the 1930's and Other Aviation Miscellany."" It consists of biographies of Billy Mitchell, Hap Arnold, Tooey Spaatz, and other military aviation pioneers, some minimal recounting of the careers of some cadets of the 1930's, and a brief overview of WW II. This book is rife with typos, egregious misspellings, and both technical and factual errors."
2,disappointed and disgruntled,"all i can say is that i bought this cd based on what i heard on medicated and like all the rest of cd's ive bought lately, this one too has taken a dump. its starts out ok, but doesnt get any better. im a fan of a constant rhythm not random noises thrown out to take up cd space. better short and sweet then long and trying. all in all it doesnt compare to roadrunner's usual line up and its not even worth whatever u pay for it, trust me it ... that bad. it seems like it was hurried and it could have been better, bottomline............potential they have, but i wouldnt give them another chance...........!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Definitely nothing great,"OK I was quite disappointed with this CD. When I first heard ""Medicated"" I liked it a lot. I kept listening to it and got tired of it fast. Then I heard the rest of the CD and my opinion of them immediately dropped. This is typical nu-metal, maybe a bit more intense them some other bands, but barely any musicianship. And the lyrics are just laughable. I hear way too much of a Slipknot influence, and they seem to try too hard to have this badass image. If you want intense, listen to Meshuggah or Lamb of God."
1,2 years too late,"Yeah, another bunch of moody white suburban/middle class mooks who scream, whine, and constantly try to act macho like there's no tomorrow. Sorry guys, but if you had come out 2 years earlier, you would have been the rage at Ozzfest and had your faces on the covers of Hit Parader and Circus Magazine. Nu-Metal is dead, and your 5 minutes of recognition is over."
4,finally some truly heavy new stuff,"well it's about freaking time we get some new truly heavy stuff. don't get me wrong, I like Linkin Park and Disturbed as much as the next maggot, but this is the kind of stuff a true metalhead always winds up craving after too much nu-metal. every track on this cd (except the last one, which is kinda lame) is incredibly good. these guys are like a cross between skinlab and slipknot. some of the vocals can be a bit of an assault on your ears at times, but the overall quality of the music makes up for this. good stuff."
5,among the best of 2002,"This is one CD you'll love if you like in-your-face metal.For the fans of Skinlab, Pissing Razors, Slipknot, Chimaira and Dry Kill Logic. Simply Awesome. Another good band from Roadrunner Records."
5,this is how it should be,"Downthesun shows how real metal should be done. they are not a little boy band that knows how to strum a guitar and pluck a bass. three good, three evil to balance it all out to make one hell of album. if you wanna put a label on them, good luck cause it will take you the rest of your life to do it. the vocals are amazing, one singing about good the other singing about the negative side, the samples and keyboards are sick as well as the guitar,bass and drums.it's hard to explain it cause it is so original. Downthesun is Downthesun, nothing else like it, not a carbon copy, the real deal. pick this album up, once you get it in your head, you won't let it out or put it down."
3,if you're still into numetal...,"...this is a decent cd. downthesun brings back alot of memories. the early days of korn, mudvayne, etc. most of it is your typical downtuned chuggin', hip-hop beating, repeated chorus music but the screams are good and some of the songs are a bit creative. it doesn't hurt to own this in your collection as you may want to listen into it every once in a while. i own alot of cds and i like to rotate through them when there's nothing to do because they bring back memories and certain events in my life. so, if you've got a buck or two to spare, grab this if you can. its the only release downthesun came out with."
1,enormous waste of $$$,"you can't get the ice out of the tray!! to loosen the ice you have to run hot water over the plastic. a) this wastes an extraordinary amount of water b) the ice then falls out & down the drain or you still have to use a fork or something to punch the ice out. this product is completely useless. run, run far far away, don't look back and warn all your friends."
4,WRIGLEY TIME MACHINE,"I BELIEVE THIS IS A GOOD LOOK AT HOW IT WAS AT WRIGLEY FIELD, THE FANS, AND THE HISTORY OF THE CUBS. AN EXCELLENT COLLECTION OF VARIOUS STORIES BY SOME CUBS ALUMINI. THE PERFECT MIX OF VETERANS REPRESENTING A DIFFERNT DECADE IN CUBS HISTORY. THE BOOK IS HUMOROUS, WELL TOLD, INTERESTING, NOSTALGIC AND DOWN RIGHT ENTERTAINING. I REALLY ENJOYED THE GREAT NOSTALGIA THIS BROUGHT BACK TO MANY CUBS FANS INCLUDING MYSELF. I CONSIDER THIS A GOOD READ AND A MUST FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CUBS FANS OR HAVE BEEN TO WRIGLEY FIELD. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
2,South Dakota map,"Got us to South Dakota, but none of the roads we wanted to go on once we were there were marked with road signs. So we had to guess and got lost. A LOT."
4,"You've Come a Long Way, Baby","While I was in college twenty years ago, I had a poster of Joan Jett on my dorm wall. I thought she was one of the hottest girls in all of show business, not just rock and roll. Her jet black hair, her intense angry eyes, those sneering red lips, that raspy voice. She had such a raw sexuality about her along with a passion and drive that made her seem remote and unattainable.Music was everything to her.I was thrilled that this DVD was produced--I think any fan of her will love it--but I'm taking a star off for an entirely non-musical reason: I miss her black hair. That butch blonde crew cut doesn't work for me.It may sound completely superficial of me but I want my Joan with that black hair. What would Elvis have been without his black hair and sideburns? (At least there's one video of ""I Hate Myself for Loving You"" included in the extras from a 1985 MTV New Year's Party of the Joan I remember).I still love you, Joanie, just bring back your hair!"
2,"Great Performance, Poor Movie","I've been a fan of Joan Jett since I first heard her in 1980. My low rating is not a rating of her performance. This video is poorly directed and poorly cut. It's difficult to watch, and there even seem to be either some unintentional drop-outs or deliberate bleeps at a couple of points. As far as I know, it's the only recorded live performance of JJ available, so if you're a fan, you'll get it and probably enjoy it. Just don't expect a work of art."
4,Joan Jett review,I only gave it 4 stars because she can always come out with more songs and albums which would leave me open to say those are 5 Stars. If you like her and when she was with the Runaways then you should like this album. Maybe not every sond but enough to buy it. Don't want to pay full price go to the used cd stores and pick it up there. I am glad I got it and look forward to maybe buying more of her work.
3,I Hate Myself for Loving You Joan,"It pains me to give this only 3 stars, if you like Joan you should still get this, but you should know what to expect. This was a 'staged' concert to make the video, so the crowd is small and for Joan Jett, a very passive crowd indeed. This takes away from making this DVD a concert like show. There is also breaks between many (all?) titles, which further takes away from the concert experience, it's more like a series of staged live appearence in front of CSN&Y fans. The sound is good, but like many rockers Joan has aged and it shows in her live performance. When I saw her live ~15 years ago she bounced around on stage like a mexican jumping bean, not anymore she's pretty much anchored on stage (at least she is on this DVD). She has obviously become more punk in the last few years based on her appearence, and since when are the words in Cherry Bomb ""I'm the f**k you've been waiting for""? Hmmm, may be time to scour for some old bootlegs..."
4,Very cute movie,This has been fun to let the kids sit down and watch. It doesnt contain anything I wouldn't let them watch.
5,Tinkerbell,We really enjoyed the new Tinkerbell movie. It kept the attention of two of my grandchildren throughout the whole movie.
2,not good enough for my daughters (who love it),"Our 3-year old has been a Peter Pan (I & II) expert for over a year, so naturally we couldn't avoid getting ""Tinkerbell."" We were disappointed by its message, which we'd translate to ""embrace your lot in life"", and don't think it's really what we'd want an assertive 21st Century woman to be trained in. That said, she loves it, of course, and it hasn't slowed the onslaught of Fairie gear in our house. We'd recommend any of the classics (Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Shrek) over this in a second."
4,A great choice for car trips!,"We bought this movie for our 2-year old to watch on a long road trip. She loves it! It's not too long and not too scary, and she is scared of even the cat in Cinderella. A great choice for car trips!"
4,tinkerbelldvd,My grand daughter is a big fan of Tinkerbell so she was thrilled to get the dvd so she could watch it and not have her Mother rent the movie.
5,Great,This movie was great. It came packed well and the movie was loved by my girls and boys (age 3-8).
4,Good Movie,All of my kids enjoyed this movie. The storyline was not quite what I was expecting but it was nice that it wasn't a continuation of an old movie.
4,Tinker Bell (BD Live) (Blu-ray),"Good stuff. The wee ones loved it for sure and viewed It lolds of time while on holiday.Give it a go, it's fun viewing for the whole family."
4,Delightful,"Tinkerbell is targeted more at children, but it is a delightful film to watch when you want something light."
2,Tink,I didn't finish watching it. Not as good as I would expect from disney. Cute but didn't hold my attention.
2,Not the Tinker Bell expected.,"Tinker Bell had a more developed personality when she didn't speak in Peter Pan. She had a lot more spunk and was overall a better character. It wasn't so much the voice, as the writing. Also had issues with one of the unintended themes of this movie that was also seen in A Bug's Life, dealing with the fairy caste system and that new ideas are not acceptable unless everyone gets into a bind. Just do the job you were assigned.The animation was done really well and the voice talent was fine.My 2.5yr old daughter loves Disney's Peter Pan and didn't want to finish this movie. She probably would've accepted the movie if it didn't include Tinker Bell. Borrowed this movie from a friend; so glad we didn't purchase or rent."
3,Tinkerbell,DVD given as a gift; I personally have never watched it but from the commercials thought this was something that the little girl would like. Rec'd thank you note so she must have liked it!
1,This movie is mind-numbingly stupid. Don't get it.,Two thumbs down. This movie is too simplistic and dumbed down. The animation is cold. They could have done a lot better.
3,"For sure, the movie is for the young (only)","This movie is not for anyone older than a single digit person. The movie surely takes you through a journey that only a child like heart can enjoy. I recommend the movie for a child, but if you are an adult and expect something more than a child's dream, look elsewhere, because it ain't here. Wait for the next Tinker Bell movie... I hear it is geared up for the whole family.The quality of the Blu Ray is excellent. The audio was very good."
2,Never rec'd movie,I'm not sure if it's the company's fault or the mail. I have ordered many items this yr & have never had one not come. The company gladly refunded my money. But I still wonder if it was shipped.
3,False Movie Trailer Advertisement,"First thing first the trailer is 80% false advertisement, meaning 80% of the trailer you see is no where in the actual Tinker Bell movie. The movie so fooled me according to the trailer.Don't get me wrong the movie was good, my three year old watched it twice and leaves a good happy feeling.But why the false advertising!!!??Way to go Disney...setting the example of LYING!!!!"
1,This Ain't Tink,"What the hell is going on here, Disney?So I get myself a `God child' -Baby L-who happens to be of the age where she'd enjoy this kind of movie and what the hell? Someone took the `bad girl' out of Tinkerbell! Who is this perfect little angel type thing because she sure ain't the nasty little Stinkerbell that collaborated against Wendy and caused a whole ton of trouble for Peter Pan in the original story. I used to love Tink, even considered having her in Ink but not this version, no way. What happened to the naughty, devious, mischievous, conniving sprite I knew and loved as a child. Glad we got this on PPV because I would NEVER (see all caps?) buy this for Baby L, no way. Don't mess with the classics, Disney, you don't have to sanitize everything and make it PC- there's room for the imperfect. I say God bless the flawed, no one is perfect. And for Hanukah this year, my `God Child' will be getting Tink, the Original (unless Disney's got it back in their `vault'!)."
5,Watched a preview copy!,My daughter (4 years old) and I both thought it was delightful. We have been waiting anxiously for Tinker Bells release and it didn't disappoint. It was very charming.
3,traditionalist,"All and well good this is a good move but the Tinkerbell here is not the Tinkerbell this dad with 2 daughters and a son grew up to love. I don't know why when a character is altered i.e. flat drawn to computer drawn or graphic to live person, The character of the character is changed. The addition of a voice also changed her. Gone is the impish fairy I grew up with and in her place is just another, albeit who can fly and is only inches tall, person.She is now encumbered with situations that we earth-bound giants have. She now has common obligations and a work-a-day job. In ""Peter Pan"" she was a free spirit simply ruled by her emotions and her friendship/love of Peter Pan."
