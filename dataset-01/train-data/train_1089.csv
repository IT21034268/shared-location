4,Modern review of Dead Sea Scrolls,"There are many DSS (Dead Sea Scroll) books out, most published in the first decade after the discovery. They are now out of date. This one is much better and a great primer on the DSS, their history, their context in politics, and their academic treatment. As a collector of DSS books, this is the best one to give to friends as gifts."
5,I'm Pleased,"The pan is well-designed and works as it's supposed to, though I'm not a professional chef by any means. It makes great pancakes. This range of Wearever pans is good quality though lighter in weight and thinner than the high-end pans. I especially like that the handle is comfortable and stays cool."
5,Great Products!,"With the proper recommended care, these products should last a lifetime. After several uses, the product still looks new.... Cheaper cookware compromises on the outside, non-cooking area (which is hard to get clean) even though the cooking area is still OK. And, if I understand correctly, breaking a glass lid on an Anolon product is not that fatal; the company will replace the lid if the customer sends Meyer the outer ring (and perhaps the knob). I like the plastic knobs (and handles) because a potholder is not necessary for cooktop use...."
3,Get the Japanese RCA import instead,"I have both; this was a great UK psych band from the late 1960's and, amazingly, without a hit single, their label, UK RCA, allowed them to issue an album. It's one of the most collectable UK Psych albums of the era. The Japanese RCA CD has the entire album plus the singles-only tracks and the sound quality is MUCH better than on this 2-CD set.The remainder of the cool, but lousy sounding demos, horrible bootleg-quality BBC sessions and two post-Bifferty projects, a Heavy Jelly and Griffin single. The really cool Griffin single was issued in stereo in the UK, but it's mono here.I'd stick with the Japanese RCA single-CD."
4,Strobe - 'See Beyond The Sun' (Mystic Stones) 4 1/2 stars,"British psych / space rock ensemble's stunning debut CD. Believe I liked this disc a bit more so than I did it's follow-up 'Maya' (see my review). Simply couldn't get enough of the seven-minute astounding ""Spiral"", the also seven-minute running fantastic virtual psychedelic piece ""Desert Storm"" [with nicely done vocals - sort of reminds me of Sundial], their true-to-the-roots '90's psych gem ""Frozen Hate"" and the must-hear / experience title cut ""See Beyond The Sun"". Has read somewhere that Strobe is like a no-man's land reply to Hawkwind-like experimentation."
5,Beautiful and large ash can,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend for his new wood stove and he just loved it. It is made very well and it is large so you don't have to empty it as much as the smaller ones. It was a great buy, delivered fast. I would def buy from this company again."
5,Alabama Atlas,This atlas is very comprehensive and adds new insight into local geography. My father-in-law lives in remote Cleburne County and visiting is always a challenge to find your way. Even he learned names for the roads he drives that are not posted anywhere but in this volume. The details are wonderful and this provides nearly all necessary maps to navigate the state.
5,Dependable,All of the DeLorme Gazetteers are wonderful. We try to get one when we go to another state. The topo lines are clear and easy to read. The maps show just enough back roads to keep you from getting lost. Don't leave home without it!
3,Great for kids,I purchased this along with several others items for children to have fun with. They have had a blast. From a distance of 3-4 feet it almost looks real.
4,just for the record,"Very nice album of material well suited to Cole's voice-- which is in fine shape. But on Charlie Rose's show she said she was the first woman to record ""A Song for You."" Natalie's version is lovely, but Lena Horne sang Hell out of it on her ""Nature's Baby"" album back around 1970-71. Neither does she cast any shade on Bette Midler's ""Stay with Me"""
2,"Natalie is no Diana Ross, and in the 70s she slammed her","Ms. Natalie has had a few memorable moments, but her own struggles with drugs and fame far outweigh any good that may have come from her carrer. Highlights for me from her are ""Miss You Like Crazy"", ""Jump Start"", and a few others, but the comment she made about Ms. Ross in the 70s when she was strung out on drugs that ""she could sing circles around Diana Ross"" annoyed my father. And I understand that. Lately, Ms. Natalie has don albums of standards (and judging by the track listings) she is doing one again ranging from Anguun covers to other more known songs.....Maybe if we are lucky it will have some original material on it by Michael Masser again who shine on his production of ""Miss You Like Crazy""...I still will see what the gal has been up to when this album comes out..."
3,Almost Forgettable,"OK - It gets three stars just because it is Natalie Cole. I mean - let's face it - she brought soul into music long before Whitney Houston was even thought of and Natalie still does it better than anyone else. At least, Natalie still puts her heart into her music and has not let her fame go to her head like other artists. However, this CD is quite disappointing on a number of levels, but mostly the song selections are poor. Natalie can do many styles but even these songs don't seem to fit her. Natalie does her best to save them but sometimes even the greatest singers can't save a bad song. If you are looking for the Natalie of days long ago with songs like This Will Be and Inseparable or Pink Cadillac or her later beautiful ballad work such as the Unforgettable and Stardust albums - sorry - you won't find it on this CD! Only if you are a diehard Natlie Cole fan should you buy this CD. I long for a new CD by Natalie where she goes back to her 1970s style of music."
3,good not great,"good title track, but the rest of the cd fails to hold my attention. the covers of reverend lee (roberta flack), say you love me(d.j.rogers), more than you'll ever know (michael ruff) and gotta serve somebody (bob dylan) feel like she's just going through the motions. the so called return to form i.e. r&b, is not at all represented here. but she gets points for trying."
1,Tacky,"Hi, it was interesting tonight to download the track ""Snowfall on the Sahara"" and Nataliue sang it okay, but really tacky naming her alblum after a tract release a couple of years ago by Angun, who definately sang the song very good and with a lot more enthusiasm that Natalie Cole ever had. I recommend listening to Angun's track released two years ago - also was there any acknowledgement in Natalies release of the song that it hadbeen released in a simialr version a couple of years ago. Tahnks for the opportunity to comment - comment, tacky Natalie!"
1,Lawsuit ?,"Does this album have or does this album NOT have any affiliation with Anggun? The name certainly appears pirated, with just a ""-fall"" added to Anggun's mega-hit ""Snow on the Sahara"". Certainly Ms. Cole cannot expect us to believe that that is just a COINCIDENCE!I notice a few people here stating that she sings Anggun's song. Well, the song which Amazon has on its link as ""Snowfall on the Sahara"", and the song which she sang on Leno under the same name, is definitely **NOT** the Anggun song. So what on EARTH are you guys talking about?I do not have the CD (I had to check a star to post), but if someone who does could post here or email me whether or not Anggun's name is listed anywhere on it (such as ""Composer:"" for the title song), I'd be most curious.Otherwise, I imagine there is a lawsuit going on over this name....?"
5,"A brilliantly performed, first-class mix of jazz and pop","This is one of the finest jazz-pop albums of the 90s, brilliantly performed and exquisitely produced. The choice of material, which varies widely, is dynamite. I must say that I disagree entirely with previous Amazon reviewers who have given poor notices to ""Stay With Me."" I think it's the apex of the CD. Natalie's rendition nearly moves me to tears, and I can't imagine anyone not feeling its power and desperation. (Anyone else agree?) I also enjoy the nostalgic ""With My Eyes Wide Open I'm Dreaming"" and the soulful, intimate ""A Song for You"" in particular. And the title tune, although its lyrics are cliche, has a calming groove and silky arrangement. This album deserves a Grammy."
3,"A nice, but not essential release from Ms. Cole","""Snowfall on the Sahara"" left me feeling empty. Don't get me wrong, her voice is awesome and in fine form, but this collection had to grow on me. Of course the title track is stunning as is ""Say You Love Me,"" but overall the collection seems kind of uneven. ""Reverend Lee"" is nice as well, but ""Corina"" leaves a lot to be desired. As I said, the collection is nice, but I was left feeling as though something was missing after waiting so long for a new Natalie Cole album. I am still waiting for the day when the Natalie that was looking for the ""Party Lights"" and had ""Love on Her Mind"" returns to form. ""Snowfall"" is okay, but for Cole's best vocal workouts seek out ""Inseperable,"" ""Natalie,"" ""Unpredictable"" and ""Thankful."""
1,Very Dissapointed with TerraNova Plumeria Botanical Watermist,"This does not smell anything like Plumeria. It smells more like Green Tea which is the main ingredient (ingredients listed below).Contains: Infusion of Green Tea, Hibiscus, Peony, Lotus, Lemon Grass, Gingko; Fragrance, certified organic Alow Vera Gel, Sorbitol, Sodium PCA, Polysorbate 20, Phenoxyethonol, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Benxoate, Ethylhexyl-Glycerin, Sodium Citrate, Popylene Glycol, Caramel, Yellow #5.Their RETURN POLICY is: Please note that a 15% restocking fee and S&H; will be assessed to all returnable products, unless it was the result of our error. Items must be returned: 1) within 14 days of receipt; 2) unopened and unused; 3) in its original packaging."
2,Not Well Written,"The author is in love with his own prose, which makes reading laborious. This is a fascinating topic with relevance to all. Some emphasis on simply telling the story and not trying to sound erudite would have been much more effective."
4,Okay,"Great for a scientific background of studies.Interesting, but not easily read.I am not sure how to use more words."
5,A scientific look at the human soul,"This thoughtful, sensitive book accomplishes the impossible; itcombines lyricism with science to help a lay person like myselfunderstand the biological basis of the human psyche. The authors make complex neuroscience accessible. The book explains what we intuitively know: attachment and human bonds are critical to happiness.I'd compare this book to the works of Carl Rogers, Arthur Sullivan, and Rollo May, for its new approach to the science of the psyche. I'm sure some of the authors' conclusions will be controversial, but that just makes the book more exciting. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in exploring the scientific basis of love. It's no accident that this book was released just before Valentine's day."
4,A General Theory of Love,"As a couple therapist, I thoroughly enjoyed this book because it does an excellent job of compiling much of the latest research on the brain, attachment theory and relationships and helps us to understand why we behave the way we do in relationships. It also challenges us to do better and guides us on we can pay more attention to nurturing love in our lives. This is a must read for anyone working with couples."
2,"Poor formatting, but not unreadable","I don't understand how these texts get through the proofing process. So many typos caused by missing spaces between words. And look how much they're charging for this. If they PRINTED books with so many errors, no bookstore would buy. Yet, here we are, forking it over. Disgraceful."
5,"Lyrical, poetic science? Believe it or not.","I'm an emotional intelligence coach, that is, I teach people how to understand and manage their emotions and those of others for better living and feeling better, and this book has probably advanced my understanding more than any book I've read in the past 5 years. I think it will be a landmark book and don't know why I don't hear about it more. It provides a solid understanding of the what's and why's of LOVE, and a good number of other things. Like why we need one another ... why isolation is so bad for us ... why we can't talk ourselves out of anger or make ourselves love someone when we don't ... why coaching works while reading self-help books doesn't! If you're seriously interesting in finding out what makes you -- and the rest of us -- tick, read this book. And whoever wrote it, writes like a poet. An absolute lyrical gem and a treat for both the limbic brain and the neocortex, I might add!"
5,illuminating!!,"As i search for the truth and secrets of happiness, this book not only clarifies many of my questions, it gives a mental map. This book is a gem."
3,"A great intro to psycho-biology, but very much evolutionary focused.","""A General Theory of Love"" presents a easy-to-read introduction to psychobiology and neurophysiology. It spends quiet a bit of time explaining neurological processes and the correlation with relationships and attachment. Overall, a worthwhile read for social workers, psychologists, and others in the human and health services field. However, be prepared that this book is fairly evolutionary based, which at times, promotes a divergence from content to lecture on the merit of this theory."
4,Dynamike33 reviews A General Theory of Love,"Well this book was recommended by my therapist, and did not disappoint. Though I think my girlfriend got more out of it than me. But overall the book was good, came on time in the condition promoted, and I would recommend it to others who want a clinical comparison of love to the standard psych angle.."
5,A General Theory of Love,Really useful information about how the different parts of our brains work together and against each other. The fact that they are still evolving causes emotional and psychological problems we encounter. Excellent reading for anyone who wants to do some real soul searching.
1,numerous fallacies,"Somehow the authors manage to supply numerous factual inaccuracies from a number of fields. Badly misrepresents ethology (mammals are loving, family-oriented -- does not indicate that the paradigmatic mammal relationship is only mother-juvenile, ending abruptly at amturity, w/ no father in sight, & sociality in herds, etc.; psychology and attachment theory (distorts Winnicott's complex relationship with Bowlby, by misused, out-of-context quote; Freud's neutrality theory (which the authors describe as advocating ""coldness""), and on and on. Finally, the authors conclude that Americans are too materialistic. Shocking. On the whole, a shallow, inaccurate, and surprisingly mean-spirited treatment of the topic."
3,a good attempt,"A general theory of love is a good attempt at explaining emotions from a neurosciences point of view. It draws on everyday logic with a bit of research to explain the possible organic basis for emotions using fashionable terms such as limbic resonance and neural imprinting. In reality trying to make sense of life by examining the brain was always going to be a difficult task. However, like many other neuropsychiatrists, the authors are scathing about psychoanalysis all the while succumbing to organic reductionism. While the science makes interesting reading, the writing is quite bad with misquotes and unrelated non-medical references which amount to nothing more than name dropping."
5,A new way of looking at love,"Although the psychological terms make it less than an easy read, this book has captivated my attention over the last few weeks. I find myself underlining the text as though I were a student again. I am looking at my fellow man as well as myself in a new light and responding in kind. A real eye opener."
4,"Go ahead buy it, you'll be happy you did","Highly enjoyable look at the biological and psychological function of love and how it permeates our lives from childhood to adulthood. The book tends to be a little too biology based for my liking but some of the chapters are extremely spot and the its' literary prose is beautiful. Overall, a highly enjoyable and rewarding book."
4,Strong start,The book starts out strong with biological explanations for why we become sad or depressed when separated from those we love. The authors provide examples of this despair occuring in most mammals and explain in great detail the areas of our brain that coincide to create attachments. But then the book takes a different turn and focuses on how to grow children who are emotionally strong and healthy. I was still looking for insight into how to foster emotional health in adults. Still a worthwhile read with fascinating examples and facts.
4,It is very Sparkly,"I like the necklace. It goes with a set I have. But, it seems a little too sparkly for natural London Blue topaz. It could be the round cut. The design is pretty and it matches my other things, OK, so I am keeping it."
3,Lending body to the dissidents,"I am not mad about this album. Both ""Yoshimi"" and ""In the Morning of the Magicians"" beat the crud out of this. This is far less processed, which might be a selling point, and if a live performance involved pulling Wayne out in front of a crowd with every limbed strapped to multiple independent instruments, I would not be surprised. No impressed."
3,i like his voice,"Ironic that a B-A-N-D's cultural celebrity status should personally offend some of you guys. ...Not only pointing out the fact you give intellectual merit and illusory credit to such a messed up system like the american recording industry by being so WHINEY about some complete stranger's fame--but that such ABSTRACT THINKERS could find it 'rational' to blow off steam at the emotional public, and on AMAZON.COM no less! You guys who are disgusted with the band's fame should go live in india for a couple years"
3,I'm so conflicted,"Seriously, the music is wonderful, it sounds very original, catchy, I would say even great. BUT......the lead vocalist's voice is horrendous. He sounds like an adolescent crowing in the shower to a tune that got stuck in his head. It really is distracting. I listend to the audio samples on Amazon, as well as read many of the glowing reviews, but was STILL taken aback. So proceed with caution. Given a few more listens, perhaps I'll warm up to it some more... In truth, the group has so much going for it, I hate to only give them three stars..."
2,I've heard this before,"and I had to think about it a little before I realized that this is the worst Yes album I've ever heard. If the Flaming Lips were ever a good band, this is not indicative of it.Boring, gauche, overemotive without actually communicating anything. Really, kids, I don't see what the hype is, unless youve smoked a few too many bones while this is on. Sober, it is gonna be difficult to stick in the changer again. The drums were nice."
3,Really a masterpiece?,"After having read all the glowing reviews this album was getting, hearing words such as ""Masterpiece"", ""Best album of the decade"", ""Majestic"", ""Magnificent""and so on, I started to get worried this album could be better than my favorite album, ""Snowbug"", by the High Llamas, also released last year. I was afraid I would like The Soft Bulletin better than Snowbug, but at the same time I was so anxious I could hardly wait to receive my Amazon package delivered to my door. But after hearing this (very good pop album indeed, no question about that) album many times, I sighed in relief and thanked God. No, it's absolutely no threat to Snowbug. Not in the slightest bit."
3,The Soft Bull,"TSB is a modestly good album with a little bit country (Neil Young) and a little bit rock and hall (ELO, Neutral Milk Hotel, CAN). I listen to it again and again, forcing myself to appreciate its really average production quality but interesting lyrics, but somehow it isn't going down yet. A tough call, a lump of possibility."
4,The Lost 1960's Concept Album.... (4 STARS),"i bought this album, after several raving reviews by top music analysts, most of which put this album as the #1 album of 1999. At first listen, I thought, ""man alive, is his voice ever annoying!"" I had heard other Lips songs and had never been found of his voice. But it began to grow on me more and more.Once I had that out of the way, I could concentrate on the music and the disc as a whole. The first song to take me in was the amazing opener ""Race for the Prize."" I STILL love that poppy, orchestrated piece of genious. But ""Buggin'"" and ""Superman"" were soon to follow. When I started noticing how ALL the songs were good, I was hooked. I couldn't keep this album out of my player.This is not only one of the best albums of 1999, but one of the best pop discs of the decade. And though I'm not a huge Flaming Lips fan, ""The Soft Bulletin"" will stay in my player for years to come. Beautiful...."
3,conflicted,"I bought this album without having that good of a knowledge of The Flaming Lips. Well, I thought it was good, but at times the album got a little bit run together and somewhat boring. The bands usage of keyboards and violins was a big plus for the album, but they used the same sound several times over to the point where it didn't really seem very interesting. So, I liked the album's sound, but some songs just didn't cream my twinky."
5,Top 5 of the 90's,"I don't know how anyone could recommend the Shins over Soft Bulletin. This is certainly one of the best albums of the last five years and has been extremely influential with mediocre bands like Radiohead, and great bands like Grandaddy. From beginning to end this album is a panoply of exquisite sounds meshed together to make a sublime wall of sound that is melodic and harmonious. Signature vocals ride smoothly on the wave of music that the Lips lay down and creates and amalgam of songs that sound similar but far surpasses any ""theme"" album. From the rising and falling of The Spark that Bled to the hauntinlgy hollow and pervasive What is the Light, the Lips made an album that is deceptive at first and must be listened to repeatedly to be completely understood. The best albums are those which sound better and better every listen, and offer more and more. There are few bands that can keep you coming back to the same album years later, and the Lips are one of them...A must have"
5,My favorite album ever,"I never wanted to review this album in the past because there was so much that I wanted to say about it and I was positive that I would miss something. Well, now I'm knida hammered so to hell with that. Wayne Coyne and Co. deliver the best album I've ever heard, period. It's epic without being excessive. Deep without being difficult. Lush without being overwhelming. Wayne Coyne is one of the best singers of all time but it's Steve Drozd that makes this album. The drums jump to the forefront and if you listen to any other cd after this, it just sounds flat. This, my friends, is music in technicolor. It's so good that it makes the near perfect Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots seem like a dissapointment, and thats a hard thing to do. I garuntee this will be the best fifteen or so bucks you spend in your entire life. I might sound melodramatic, but I swear to you this is the greatest thing I've ever heard, ever."
2,I must be missing something here...,"I must be missing something here. I have a very extensive CD and vinyl collection, and have very wide ranging musical tastes. I bought The Soft Bulletin for two reasons: One, the reviews on the cover which rated it as outstanding. Two,for the front cover photo, which is of a guy tripping on acid and freaking to his own shadow (from a Life magazine story on LSD, I remember reading as a kid). But, I really did not care for this recording. I found the vocals particularly irritating, and the over-arranged string sounds really cheezy. The lyrics are downright silly. I do like the psychedelic nuances, but not enough to recommend this to anyone. So, I'm obviously in the minority on this one. My copy of Soft Bulletin, is going straight to the cut - out bin at my local used CD store. If anybody out there wants a free copy, get with me soon. It's not often that I say this, but I found it practically unlistenable. Sorry. Great cover, and artwork though."
5,It's Good,"This CD is very well made. Really. It doesn't scratch very easily. I've put it to the test rubbing it on various surfaces with minimal damage. I was also surprised to find that it was flame-retardant. To a degree. Holds up well in an earthquake too! Or at least I bet it would. I shook it pretty hard and it didn't break. The CD booklet smells slightly of fish, which was a slight turnoff at first, but it grew on me after a while.Okay I know I'm ridiculous, but really. If you're going to listen to Flaming Lips, you gotta think like that. Amazing album by an amazing trio."
1,Way over rated,This CD does NOT merit the fantastic reviews made by Amazon critics. Were the reviewers friends or relatives of the band or its producer? The lyrics are silly. The vocals are very weak. The instrumentation is uninspired. I don't think that this Emperor is wearing any clothes and I'm even more disappointed by the reviews. I will be more careful buying something sight unseen (or sound unheard) next time.
3,A mixed bag,"There are some great songs on this album, but there is also a lot of experimental/unpalatable stuff. I would say that the ""Yoshimi"" and ""Mysitcs"" albums are better examples of where the Lips finally figured out how to really craft their songwriting for maximum impact on the listener."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I really wanted to like this cd after all the rave reviews its recieved, but i just don't get it, having played it many times over the last 2 or 3 yrs there is quite simply nothing to grab on to and by the time you get to the end of the cd, it all becomes rather forgettable.oviously an aquired taste."
4,Camembert and Tomme de Savoie,"Question: How do you make a ""critic"" squeal?Answer: Twist 'em by their pitch perfect ear."
5,Unparalleled,"Uniqueness is the very vein of the Flaming Lips. Wayne Coyne thrives on being different, and with the Soft Bulletin, he manages to achieve the greatness that accompanies releasing a bonafide classic album. I agree with every reviewer who believes that you experience this album more than just listening to it. ""Race for the Prize"" is a listener-friendly opener to a wide range of experiments in sound (name the instrument and they probably used it) that makes stops in just about every capital on the emotional map. ""Buggin"" is a pleasure to listen to as is ""Feeling Yourself Disintegrate"". And one can't possibly imagine a better way to close an extraordinary effort than with a more radio-friendly mix of ""Waitin for a Superman"". The song is amazingly honest and simple, yet remarkable all the same. If you've never liked the Flaming Lips before, give them a second chance with the Soft Bulletin. The critics are right."
5,Took me by surprise!,"I bought this album purely on the buzz it was receiving. Hearing the previous efforts from the Lips made me think it was going to be another journey into the life of everyday non-sense. What I heard was some of the most profound thinking in an album that I've listened to in a long time. The music was light-years ahead of their past albums. Their tone has changed and a vivid maturity is present. Wild and witty, the sounds you'll hear are amazing."
4,one more word,"Clarification: Comparisons to Neil or Pink Floyd are fair and accurate (sorry). I have not doubt Wayne sounds somewhat like Neil (ie: ""After the Gold Rush"" on ""The Bridge"" tribute). But saying the Flaming Lips have no talent, originality, or musical value because all they do is mimic other performers is my beef."
2,Bulletin: I'm not convinced,"I bought The Soft Bulletin a couple of months ago and have listened to it a dozen times since. Although there are a few high spots, each time I listen, I wonder what all of the fuss is about. To me, the album sounds like ersatz Moody Blues (not a good thing) with faint intimations of a dozen better groups or individuals. I think the album is pretentious and derivative--it hasn't worn well for these ears."
3,"excellent instrumentals, good music, bad singing","I bought this some time ago and agree with many of the praises heaped on it. I think it is innovative, complex, harmonically adventurous music with droll lyrics and wonderful, concentrated instrumentals. But why don't more people notice that the singer is lousy? After a few listenings, I started to dread his flat intonation and weak, forced-sounding voice. I don't think it's really a style (in the sense that Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins or Thom Yorke of Radiohead only approximately carry a tune, yet have evident control over their voices); this sounds like incompetence to me. He sounds like he's trying hard, too hard, but never quite makes it. If vocal execution doesn't bother you, you'll be fine: there's a lot to recommend this music, as many have written. But if you expect the vocals to be pulled off with as much skill as the admittedly very fine instrumentals, you may grow annoyed as I did."
2,NOT THAT GOOD,this album really isnt that good. its horribly overrated. sure the flaming lips have had their moments in the past but their last two albums (this one and yoshimi) are just plain bad. both are over produced and get pretty boring after multiple listens.
5,Artists on Parade,"I can't remember why or how I came to select The Flaming Lips as one of my bands, but I decided to buy ""Hit to Death in the Future Head"". That album was all right, but I sensed something different was about to spring forth from these Artists. Therefore, I bought the next one and the next one, and then I bought Zaireeka...Wow, did I call it right. Then I bought The Soft Bulletin, and I realized these guys were some of the most brilliant artists of our time. In much the same way Picasso, Brando and Hemingway were consumate artists who forever changed the scope of their respective fields, The Flaming Lips have achieved things nobody else is even imagining."
4,"""Suddenly Everything Has Changed""","I believe the song ""Suddenly Everything has changed"" is the most innovative song on The Soft Bulletin Album because it needs the listener to respond for the song to work. Not only are the lyrics meaningful but the music plays an important role, too.The lyrics are simple enough to understand. Wayne Coyne talks about how we sometimes look at our pasts when we've all become adults and notice how much we have changed over the years. And how we don't notice it gradually but instead it hits us in the face all at once.The reason the music plays an important role is because sometimes it's all we hear during the song. In this song there are very few lyrics. In fact, he stops singing three times during the song to let the listener reflect on their lives and wonder how suddenly everything has changed."
4,I'm not sure what to think yet...,"I like this album and certainly don't have anything negative to say about it, but certain ""Led Zeppelin"" moments kind of keep jumping out at me from the speakers. Also, every song seems to have the same ""tripped-out"" mood... Maybe I'm just not used to this band yet."
1,awful.,"what utter garbage.i've tossed it in the pile with mercury rev's 'deserter's songs', which isn't far behind at all.ah, to have my eleven dollars back..."
1,Are they serious?,"A friend of mine recommended this by telling me that, at first listen, he thought this was the most trite and idiotic thing he'd ever heard. Then after repeated listenings, he turned around completely and thought it was a work of genius. Well, it never got past trite and idiotic for me. Add to that the facts that the synth sounds are hackneyed and outdated, the singer can't actually sing, and the lyrics sound like something a fourth grade sci fi geek would find only moderately clever, and you are left with a disc that has very little going for it. To be fair to the fans of the Lips, this may just be an acquired taste, but I have no desire to acquire it."
1,"As if ""Dark SIde of the Moon"" weren't bad enough...","Words cannot convey how mediocre, annoying and derivative this is... Anyone who says otherwise knows nothing about their music of the last 35 years. Whiny vocals, ripped-off arrangements, faux-mystical new age namby-pamby lyrics... Get a life, dudes. This is the musical equivalent of going back to wearing diapers."
1,???????,"I havent listened to these guys since vaseline way back in the early 90's........after reading rave reviews about this album, here on amazon, i had to see what the fuss was about...The first couple of tracks are ok.....especially the first one, that is the best song off the album....as i got further down the trackilisting, they start to all sound the same....how about the singer, if my memory is correct, he is that crazy looking clown like idiot with huge red puffy hair.....i think his voice is so stupid, its not even funny.....oh and the lyrics, come on now.....they are ABSOLUTELY ridiculousIf you consider yourself as one of those worm type little people, that rootes for guys like roger from the nerds.....this is your type of music...."
1,Flaming Lips,"My rating is based on the only song I've heard, ""Race for the prize"". I think that song is so annoying that there's absolutely NO way i'm buying this album...."
2,What is the attraction?,"I have over 4,000 lps and 5,000 CDs in my collection. Believe me, nobody would ever accuse me of being overtly mainstream. But, as much as I have tried to embrace this band (I tend to trust my peers when they vehemently reccomend something), I can't for the life of me figure out why anyone would want to play this. Maybe I need to see them live. For you fans, I don't want to damper your enthusiasm -- it's marvelous to truly love a band and it's music. But, for perhaps the first time ever, I simply can't figure out why this is more special, or even remotely as good, as a lot of other releases were in that year. Sorry. Maybe a listenable singer would help, I dunno. I know Coyne's a supposed ""genius"" and all, but..."
2,Dont believe the hype,"Mediocre melodies packaged in bubblegum radio-ready dressing. Ignore the admittedly omnipresent hype and buy something else instead, perhaps Wilco's Summer Teeth, a far superior album."
5,Lips Worth Kissing,"This is the first time (out of many reviews) that I'm giving a disc 5 stars. This is the album that I KNEW the Flaming Lips could make; it's the one instance out of a million where my expectations were not only met, but well exceeded. This the Lips' equivalent to 'The Wall'- a masterpiece. I can't believe these are the same guys who did 'Jesus Shootin' Heroin'; their musical and artistic growth is astounding. The only thing that upsets me about this CD is that it won't sell as well as _________ (fill in the blank with ""Ricky Martin"" or ""Bush"" or whatever the kids are listening to these days.). Folks, this WILL BE ""Album of the Year"", despite what the Grammy Awards will have you believe. Buy it!"
3,"interesting, but not lasting","Anyone with ears has to admit there are very grand sounds on display here. ""Race For the Prize"" is hands-down brilliant. There's only one complaint: The lyrics are saturated in quasi-sci-fi gobbeldy-gook. After a while, the whole affair reminds you of your older brother's cheesy Yes albums. Can anyone really, truly identify with a song as silly as the ""The Spiderbite""? Sure, not all popular music should be as direct and honest as an Al Green tune. At the same time, after three whole listens, the Flaming Lips' prog-rock tendencies and Floydisms drag the ship down."
2,Am I the only one that doesn't hear it?,"Nothing but five star reviews, critics slobbering all over it... I guess I'm losing it. I just don't hear it! Sounds slow and boring to me!"
5,An amazingly original work of art!,"I was reading all the good reviews about this album and I decided to buy it as long as my dad, who was interested also, paid for half of it. My dad and I really enjoyed this album. The originality of the songs, the bizarre sounds (especially in ""The Gash"") and how the Lips put it all together to form one of my favorite albums of all time!My favorite tracks on this album include both versions of ""Race for the Prize"" and ""Waiting for a Superman"". I also like ""Suddenly Everything Has Changed"" and ""The Spark That Bled"". Oh, and the two instrumental tracks are cool, too."
4,My review !!,"this bread I feel is a good alternative to starting from scratch however I did add some of my own ingredients so I don't know how it would taste on its own..I did think it needed sweetening up a little..for anyone interested I did add pecan nuts, cinnamon and orange peel which gave it more flavour...[I did not use the walnuts which were included ]I never use any type of nuts which are included in packaged breads..Next time I will add sugar to the mixture.. it was easy enough to prepare which was what I wanted .."
1,I never received this albun. They said last year it was out of stock and backordered but I didn't receive it.,"I can't review it, it was back ordered last year and I never have received it."
3,Christmas with Alabama,Helps round out my Alabama collection. Shipped & received in good condition. Nice job in handling my order.
5,Great Christmas CD,"If you love ALABAMA & you love Christmas songs, then you will definitely love this CD by ALABAMA."
5,More than most can handle,"Spady is ahead of his time and could have saved us from the crisis our children now face. We've reduced ""educated"" to a simple skill set and now children are learning to hate learning. If you are interested in developing a population capable of doing more than jumping through academic books, this book is for you."
1,Beyond Counterfit Reforms,This man is the worst thing to ever happen to education. My district has done everything in his book and now social skills are more important than acedemic skills. Grades are slowly going by the way side.Every parent should read this and keep it out of your district. Know the signs of Outcome Based Education before it's too late.
2,Good feel but colors bleed,"I really like the feel of these cards, almost like brand new paper cards. Unfortunately, the colors bleed really badly, ruining the cards before their time."
3,Interaction of Humanist and Religious Art in Different Media,"The DVD under review introduces viewers to both the secular and religious art of Europe between the 15th and 18th centuries C.E. Superb photography, erudite comments, and non-intrusive background music allow viewers to grasp the metamorphosis of art in different media during the Renaissance, Baroque, and Rococo periods. Unfortunately, the three-part series shows its age because it was originally released in both 1990 and 1991. The quality of the image is at times sub-optimal. This series should be shot again because of the importance of high definition in visualizing art."
4,Crunchy Goodness for 0 points!,"I have been on the Weight Watchers point system for about 4 months and lost 25lbs! I love finding new products that are easy and convenient for me to eat while at work, at the gym or at home. I love these apple chips! We found them in a 2.6 ounce bag at the health food store for 2.50. They have 29 calories per .5 ounce which is 0 points! They are crunchy and sweet, although sometimes you get a funky aftertaste after a bite. I wish that amazon sold them in the 2.6 ounce bags because 96 bags are a bit too many to buy all at once!"
2,Quality Control?!,"These apple chips are really tasty, but I have to wonder about their quality control...the bags often contain core, stems, seeds, and recently I had an apple chip with the STICKER still on the peel!"
5,"Love, love, love!","I love these apple chips, they are simple and perfect. Perfectly crunchy and chewy! You can't go wrong with these individual sizes, they fit perfectly in your backpack, purse or glove box. I carry them everywhere!"
3,its ok,took it for 6 weeks. give me a good pump but gives me a run also. after taking it my strength went down alot.
1,Cut right through,"I live in a pretty high bike theft area and was naively sold this U-lock from the local bike shop. Within 6 months of using this lock, it was cut right through with some kind of buzz saw and my bike was stolen. The bracket is awful! It wouldn't secure the lock and I've had the lock fallen off the bracket while riding. If you live in a low to moderate bike theft area, this lock may do but I would go with a sturdier lock like a Kryptonite in the future."
2,This lock could not take my abuse,"I am writing this review 6 months after I purchased this lock. You see, I'm the type of person who tends to drop things all the time and after 6 months of dropping this lock on the pavement, it finally broke apart into 6 pieces. My Master lock and my Kryptonite locks lasted longer.If you are a clumsy person like me, I would not recommend this lock at all."
3,TOUGH LOCK BUT CANNOT MOUNT,"This lock is long enough to reach most parking meters abd street poles...but also too long to mount on many bikes. My bike is 20.5"" and it is too big. And the mounting bracket is plastic and does not hold the lock steady. Fortunately, I usually ride without leaving my bike parked. When I intend to park my bike, which is unusual, I will carry the lock in a small backpack. The quality and ease of use of the lock seems good, and I like that it can be reversed and that there is a cover for the insert. Just don't plan to mount this on your bike."
3,"For Indoor Use only. Dust Jams It. Cheaply made, but tough.","Pretty hard to defeat, but it does not seem durable. The lock cylinder jams from dust if left locked in windy dusty areas. I was able to clear and unjam it with spray brake cleaner the two times it jammed on me. Following the instructions, I sprayed it regularly with WD 40, but that seemed to attract grit, making it worse. I keep a roll of black tape with me to completely cover the key slot and the silly loose-fitting cover to keep blowing dust and rain from entering the lock mechanism. I am also very careful not to drop it."
5,I LOVE this headlight! I only buy Dorcy now.,"I LOVE this headlight! It produces a STRONG, very bright light - as much as a bright handheld. I am in the process of upgrading all my flashlights and headlights after superstorm Sandy -- and now I only buy Dorcy lights. My older headlights were the regular LEDs you can buy at Lowes or Home Depot. But these are WAY better, much more bright. Dorcy also make a 41-2098 headlight, and I have one of those too. But this model is a bit brighter than that one.It has 4 settings (press the button once to cycle through each one): high, lower, flashing and off. There is not much difference between high and lower, but that's OK. Perhaps I could use the Flashing setting as a warning beacon...? I will definitely be buying 4 more for me and my family for the next power outage. Highly recommended."
1,One star for DVD-R - three for film.,"Amazon Rip-Off! Selling a DVD-R for this price and not even being clear that it is a DVD-R.BE CAREFUL WHEN BUYING CLASSIC FILMS FROM AMAZON. More and more are on DVD-R while being listed as DVD's until you read the fine print.These should be clearly id'ed as DVD-R and sold for less money for people willing to accept lower quality.I enjoyed the movie, by the way."
1,TEKTON extension set,"This product broke when pressure was applied. This set was an inexpensive alternative to brand name, well known manufacturers product. Live and learn."
2,Not very accurate so what's the point?,The indoor thermometer is fairly accurate but it's not very quick to change. The manual states that it's updated every 10 seconds but I've found it to be more like 30 minutes.The outdoor portion is even worse. It takes hours to adjust its temperature and so it's regularly off by 10-20 degrees. The other night it was 84 (by another thermometer) but the outdoor reading said 107! A couple hours later it did come back down to the correct temp but that really doesn't matter does it. It needs to be accurate in real time.
1,The Weather Channel WS-7013TWC Wireless Temperature Station,"Outdoor remote temperature sensor is not weatherproof. Instructions state ""The remote temperature sensor should be placed in a dry, shaded area."" The battery cover has slits in it that will allow water to enter the unit.Hard to see how they call it an outdoor remote."
5,Great book for learning ASL,I bought this for my son who has verbal apraxia. I love the description that goes along with each diagram. Very easy to follow.We also have the video which my son loves.
3,Not for novice programmers,"I love the web wizard's series, and had high hopes for using this book in an intro-level course. But the programming concepts come too fast for someone who hasn't done any programming. Chapter 1 throws out a zillion concepts without giving enough concrete examples of how they are used, so they will remain abstract to novices.An example: comparison operators are introduced on page 10, when one has no conceivable use for them. And then on page 20, we get to loops, and on page 21, conditional statements. You just can't pick up javascript this way unless you already know how to program.This is probably a fine book for folks who already know how to program, but want to pick up javascript. But OTOH, if you already know how to program, aren't you ready for the O'Reilly Javascript books?I'm not sure what this book's niche is. I thought the web wizard's series was for novices."
3,"A good hard rock album, not great","""Laced"" isn't the greatest cd in the world, but it's worth the ten bucks I paid for it. The band is definitely influenced by Rage, at least in the lyrics department, but they don't come close when it comes to musical talents. The lead singer's lyrics are powerful and socially concious, ala Zach De La Rocha and Rage, but the band's typical heavy metal guitar sounds can get old and they certainly don't compare to those of Tom Morello. Also, Reveille's lead singer, at first listen, sounds very similar if not exactly like De La Rocha of Rage. However, Reveille's lead singer does much more screaming and yelling which always helps the blood get pumping. Overall, the album is worth a listen and the couple of bucks required for it. The standout songs are Butterfly, The Phoenix, and Untied."
3,"close, but no cigar","i bought this cd after reading some of the reviews here. what i failed to realize is that75% of them come from MA(where the band originated). so without the hometown favoritism, this band lacks creativity. their lyrics are typical and boring. it actually sounds like they are trying to imitate other bands. where's the talent in that. the only thing that i like about this cd is that its loud. its heavy, and thats all that counts. as far as talent, back to the garage guys."
4,"Starts out kickin', but falls apart","I bought this CD because i heard about it from a friend. He told me they were like Rage so i decided to give it a chance. I went out and spent the 10$ on it and listened to it. Now the first track ""Butterfly"" is powerful and hard hitting. But unfortunatly, it falls apart after about the 3rd track. Which is a shame. The only problem i really have with them is they sound TOO MUCH like Rage and aren't too original."
1,Boring and univentive.,"I bought this album after reading all of the ""great"" reviews that listeners have posted here on Amazon, and, after listening to it myself, well... I wish to God that I could get my money back. They sound like a thousand other mediocre metal bands. Their guitar riffs are basic and boring, their vocalist tries way to hard to sound mean, and the songs have little variation to them. If you were to take Rage Against The Machine, Korn, and Helmet, smash them together, and send them back to the garage in their parents' house, then you'd get this band. Reveille's ""Laced"" is terrible."
1,Rage Against the Machine,"Someone in a previous review of this CD said they dont understand why people are mad at Reveille for sounding like Rage Against the Machine. Well, I am not mad at them for that. I am mad at them because they stink, just like Rage Against the Machine does. When are these psuedo-hostile hip hop based wimpy rap rock bands gonna go away? Remember the Seattle Grunge scene? What do you think is gonna happen to Rap Rock? Same thing. Passing ... fad."
2,Where have I Heard This Before?,"Though there are definitely some interesting transitions, strong guitar riffs and pounding beats, I just can't buy into this band. They sound good, but way too much like Rage Against The Machine. They have the potential, and should focus on developing an original sound of there own instead of riding on the coat tails of another."
3,Good,Reveille is not a very well known band but they have some great music. If you like heavy-metal mixed with some hip-hop you will love this band and album.
3,Good-but i've heard it before,"Reveille's ""Laced"" debut will act as a good building block for future efforts, but this album alone just doesn't cut it. They sound too much like RATM, and a little like the Deftones. Despite sounding like these other great bands, Reveille has some shining moments. I personally love the track with B-Real, ""Splitt"", this song is by far the best on the album and should be listened to repeatedly. Overall I like the album, but if i want to listen to rock'n'rap, I'd choose RATM, Limp Bizkit, or Kid Rock first."
4,More like Slipknot,People say they sound like Rage. Apparently they haven't heard Slipknot yet because they sound MUCH more like Slipknot than Rage. It's in the hardness..the beat..and the vocals are as rough and loud and painful as Slipknot's. Definitely harder than Rage.
5,...honeymoon!?!?!...naw...bachelor party? oh yeah!!...,"...first of all, let me say this: I WOULD PAY TWICE AS MUCH AS THIS CD IS WORTH for track #1 alone!!! three times as much!!! 'loran's dance' - that is an awesome uptempo jazz tune and i been lookin for it since forever!! cant find it nowhere else online or in town...the entire album is excellent, specially if you like your jazz on that underground hip-hop vibe...several of the tracks are lyrically laced. and although i enjoy me some hip-hop aint noway i would think of playin this on my honeymoon!.. cam got some smoove-jazzed out pieces on here fasho, but overall, this is strictly for the bachelor party!...(honeymoon? riiiiight...like i said, cam is on somethin! somethin good, too!). yall already familiar with cam are gonna feel this...if you a newbie to this, then check out his 'mad blunted jazz' also...that disc is somethin serious!....."
2,"Works, But Has a Substantial Design Flaw","This handy retractable power adapter for my cell phone makes managing accessories in my car much easier.Although the connector was a snug fit for my phone, it did work... at first. The second time I tried to use it, the connector kept falling out of my phone. After investigating, I found that the two tiny, metal, teeth that hold the connector securely against the phone had been pushed back into the connector. Fortunately, I needed to trim my nails and was barely able to pull them back out.The connector still works. But, I suspect my little trick for pulling the teeth back out will not work very long, if ever again. Because of this, I cannot recommend this item to anyone."
5,OFF the HOOK!!!! Getcha' ya' bling with the Neptune Sound!,Pharrell's producing skills are constantly in flux of reinventing itself....This man moves forward in life and never backwards....This track proves his wisdom has grown over the years....The man is now a sensai.
4,Good product; doesn't burn a hole in your gut,"Solgar consistently makes a good product. I've taken iron in the past where it did one of two things: burned a hole in my gut (or at least it felt like it) or created a plug of constipation (TMI, I know). This product did neither, and I felt a boost of energy from the iron helping to restore my low levels. I also like that this product doesn't have any dyes or additives. Who needs extra carcinogens? I really don't mind taking brown pills. In fact, bright pink or turquoise vitamins make me suspicious."
5,I loved the book.,"I thought this was very informative. I was a little skeptical to buy it with the other reviews, but took the chance and I love it! I also went on the websites in the book and they offer advice in addition to the info in the book. And the author is there to answer any questions you may have (I had a couple), so this is a must buy for people who are just getting into the fursuiting community,like me."
4,Great book for Furries,"Great book for those interested in making fursuits. Goes over all the basics, but unfortunately just barely touches the more advanced stuff like air brushing. The book is also a little out dated concerning the various newer techniques like the ""ninja hood"" style mask and body part molding. Still a great book to have to give you an idea how to make a suit from scratch. There's plenty of good websites and social networking communities out there dedicated to fursuit making that can supplement this book very nicely."
4,Needs a little more for those that are into clay/latex,"The book is great if your into sewing, creating costumes, and such. But it's a bit skimpy when it comes to us clay sculptors. Basically the latex chapter near the end is a bit too short for my tastes and doesn't offer the different ways of making latex or foam latex masks/props. Or other ways to make masks with clay and molds with different materials besides latex.It would have be nicer if that section had more pages to it. Overall the book is a great read and good resource. But does it need to be a spiral bound book? Why couldn't the book be bound normally with a protective cover like many paperback books?I've found that the book cover (front and back) picks up clay, dirt, and gets scratches in a sculpting class. So it's not a book to have on hand in a very hard work environment. If your in a place like that and care for your books, make sure to copy pages from the book and take the Xeroxed pages with you in class or work space."
4,No Strain on the Brain-Just Fun,"Grace Hollister wanted nothing more than a fun, literary vacation in England's Lake District, the favorite stomping grounds of her favorite Romantic authors. During a leisurely walk in the woods, Grace discovers the body of a man in a stream. The body turns out to be alive-very alive-and Grace seems unable to leave Peter Fox, the body, alone. When the men who tried to kill Peter attack and kidnap Grace, the two decide (Peter somewhat reluctantly) to team up and figure out what the kidnappers want.This book has a lot going for it-a fun, smart main character who loves English poets; a sexy love interest who can cook and is into antiques; a quirky mystery. All it in all, it was a delightful romp--but very easy on the brain. I can see this being a successful series with two sets of romantic detectives. If you're into real sleuthing, skip this altogether. But, if you want a fun, easy read, this was a pleasant diversion."
2,Grace Hollister--could never survive the real world,"I bought this novel based on the glowing reviews associated with it, and have to say I was somewhat disappointed. While the 18th century poetry and literature references were nice, they couldn't successfully neutralize Grace's utter daftness--she's like Daphne from Scooby Doo. If her character had only been a little smarter, I wouldn't have winced from page to page.As it was, all I can think is that Peter must enjoy answering inane questions and dealing with a ditz on a day-to-day basis. I don't mean to be cruel--just saying I think the book could have been better if the main character hadn't seen an enemy in everyone and everything.And you don't brown garlic! You saute it!"
1,A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT,"This flat-footed Frankenstein's Monster of a book is pieced together from bits and pieces of other long and deservedly interred novels. Killian gives us a character from here and plot twist from there, stirs it up in a swift-reading witless stew and serves it up on rewarmed dishes. Self-conscious and desperately eager to please, the book is half half-baked whodunnit and half tepid romance. Presumably about a gift of cameos Byron assembled for the 10th birthday of his daughter by his half-sister, the book seems to think ""gewgaws"" is a word no one has ever heard of, although the characters can quote Byron and others at will. This book is about as satisfying as a stale potato chip when you're famished for a steak dinner. Not for the discriminating or those who value real intelligence."
3,"Just not as good as ""Little Green Lights""","This album by John Tejada is much harder techno than his other album, ""Little Green Lights"". There is melody in Tejada's harder stuff so don't go thinking it is ear shattering techno because it ain't.It is just very samey and is one for the real Tejada fan, like myself as I am able to overcome the albums shortcomings as will other I'm sure.The first track is very melodic, but after that it is much harder until the last couple of tracks.If you're familiar with John's work, you won't be disappointed, but if you're looking for something innovative, look elsewhere, perhaps buys his other album that I have previously mentioned, under his own name."
1,Who's idea was it to Discofy famous Sci-Fi theme songs??,"I bought this CD many many years ago by chance, it's quite awful, so bad in fact that it hurts sometimes. Yet it has such camp value that I never had it my heart to toss it. When one listens to it, they are warped to a strange demented world... What shocked me the most about this compilation; that it was created years after Disco, so I think it was someone's evil plan to ""warp"" music!If you ever find a copy, you either are very lucky, or insane, but none the less it's a great conversation piece. What demented mind created this compilation, we'll never know but at least we can have a good laugh!"
3,"OK, but too much work","The recipes aren't bad, especially health wise, but there's a LOT of prep...including sauteeing food before putting it in the crock pot. A good buy if you have time, but if you're looking for something that you expect from a crockpot (throw it all in and leave!), this one may not be right for you."
2,Too Much Preparation,"I am new to slow cooking and got this book from the library to get some new recipe ideas. This book is very nicely arranged (separate sections for: bread/breakfast, soups, poultry/seafood, meat, pasta, vegetarian and dessert) with nice full color photographs of the food and nutritional information on each dish.Though it does contain many delicious sounding recipes, I was frustrated that nearly all of them require pre-preparation of the food beyond just browning meat or chopping vegetables. Nearly every one of the recipes I wanted to attempt began with ""In a skillet...."" Personally, I was looking for healthy recipes with minimal pre-prep that I could put together while my children napped or were occupied during the day and NOT what amounts to cooking an entire meal on the stovetop and then throwing it in a slow cooker.This would be a good purchase for someone with more time on their hands but for me, it just didn't work."
2,Not Worth the Purchase !,One of the guidelines I go by is that if I can find one good recipe in a book it was worth the purchase - This was not ! I'M NOT KIDDING - One of the recipes was for cooking basic beans !
1,Gave it away,"I really didn't like this book. Maybe I should have tried more of the recipes, but there was one I couldn't even eat! Usually if something isn't very good, I can still eat it...but not here. I would go for something else."
2,Not for a beginner or if you want easy recipes,"Unfortunately I have to agree with ""too difficult""s review.This book has wonderful recipes but they are more complicated than if you tried to cook them the standard way using a regular cookbook. This works for people who actually get home from work before 7pm or have time to prep for cooking. Could be a good weekend cookbook.Really it seems some of these things could be adjusted to the modern working person's lifestyle, it would be better if the cook book gave you alternatives to ""browning seeds and grinding them""(!) Healthy cooking doesn't really require all that. But I plan to substitue here and there through out the book........ If I keep it.On the plus side: Lovely pictures."
2,Only 3 or 4 dishes I would actually make,"If beans, lentils and other legumes aren't your thing then DO NOT get this book! Many of the recipes require some type of legume and a good portion require a trip to a more gourmet type store. Lots of fish recipes if you are a fish lover. Not too many for meat. The presentation of the book is excellent, with wonderful pictures, easy to read recipes, slow cooker tips and nutritional information, but I live in a house full of pretty basic eaters. While I don't want to dump chicken in with cream of mushroom soup and call it a meal, I also don't care to mix prunes and quinoa (who knew quinoa was so expensive?) with my chicken and have to locate 'herbs de Provence'."
3,Pretty good,"The recipes in here are OK, I guess. I just don't get good results from a slow cooker, and hoped this would work out for me. Some of the recipes are fine - she seems to like millet and rosemary, and way too many onions. At the end of the day, the more chili-ish or stew-like, the better it turned out. Many recipes require a fair amount of prep and stove work. Maybe I should just give up on the crockpot..."
4,"Good recipes, easy to follow book","The author of this cookbook wrote another one of my favorite cookbooks (The Complete Whole Grains Cookbook: 150 Recipes for Healthy Livingso when we began slow cooking, I was pleased to see an offering from her. We are pretty pleased with the recipes we have tried so far, they have been pretty tasty and relatively simple to prepare. There is more preparation in these recipes than throw ingredients into cooker and start but nothing has been difficult. The recipes are easy to follow and contain interesting nutritional information after each recipe about the ingredients used to prepare the recipe. While these recipes are very healthy, this is not a vegetarian cookbook. It does however, label recipes as either vegetarian or vegan and many recipes are included under these labels. Recommend."
2,Too Difficult!,"I bought this book for the express purpose of throwing everything into a slow cooker and leaving for the workday to come home to a great smelling, great tasting dish. The recipes sound fantastic and I'm sure they come out well too, but almost every recipe starts with ""brown the onions and garlic in a skillet"", ""toast the seeds until brown"", etc.., etc...so again almost *always*, there is way more prep work than just chopping up your ingredients and throwing them in. Now again, I haven't tried a recipe yet, but my reason for buying this book was simplicity. It is not simple."
2,A mixed bag,"Some decent recipes in here but some real stinkers too. Better than most slow cooker recipe books but that's not saying much. Pasta with Syracuse sauce is quite nice. Meat dishes are generally better than the vegan dishes.The biggest single problem I see is the incessant use of cracked black peppercorns in almost everything. I just looked briefly through more than a dozen recipes and every one included peppercorns. Of course it's easy to omit the pepper, but it says a lot about the author that she thinks peppercorns should be included in everything. She seems to have a thing for celery too."
2,Not a fan of this cookbook,I was excited to have a cookbook with healthier recipes than the traditional ones with lots of processed foods. Unfortunately this book has only a handful of recipes that I am interested in making -- an overabundance of recipes w/beans and legumes or ingredients that I am unlikely to have on hand in my pantry. Not the starter/beginner cookbook I need.
2,Not a Favorite,"I have hundreds of cookbooks but this is the first I'm returning....hardly any recipes that I'll use, ingredients I don't keep on hand, and a lot of the recipes take more time than I have to pre-prepare for the slow cooker."
2,Wish I wouldn't have purchased,Even after reading the other reviews I figured I'd give this cookbook a try because I really wanted something with healthy recipes I could make in my slow cooker. There are very few recipes I can even make. Most of the ingredients are impossible for me to locate. I'm all for gourmet food and being difficult to prepare isn't a problem for me either. I just need to be able to locate the ingredients.
2,"Nice book, but had to return it.","I wanted to start the year off right by only cooking healthy meals in my crockpot. Although this was a nice looking book, with great pictures and details--I didn't find any of the recipes useful. After looking thru the whole book, I knew that this wasn't the cookbook for me. None of the recipes were those that my family would eat. I have a 7 year old daughter, and the ingredients in this book were not very kid friendly. I guess I was hoping for more ""down-home"", average recipes. If you are more of an adventurous eater, then I am sure you will like this book. As for me...my search is back on for a healthy, crockpot cookbook!"
1,"Would have bought if had ""look inside""","This is a note to the editor. I didn't buy this book because you didn't allow a ""look inside"".I probably would have bought it if I could have flipped through it as I would in a bookstore if you would have permitted Amazon's ""Look Inside""."
5,Tasty slow cooker meals,"I also thought I would not like to have to pre-cook items that I had previously tossed in the slow cooker together but, once I did it, I would never go back to the more traditional way of preparation. The flavors of the sauteed vegetables and meat are so much more pronounced and flavorful. Adding items during the last 20 minutes like peppers and seafood prevent them from overccoking and becoming mushy. I have found recipes in this book all don't taste alike due to the flavor layering. Yes, it does take more time than traditional slow cooker recipes but it is well worth the investment. I only make the recipes on Sunday so it's not a problem. I have also started to use the same cooking techniques with other slow cooker recipes. I have also seen new recipes requiring the same sauteeing requirements. I would definitly buy another of her slow cooker books."
4,"Very strange, Very good!","Despite being shot on digital video, these shorts feature artful compositions and editing. The acting and directing are not too shoddy either for such a grassroots production. More like old John Waters films, but with a more sophisticated edge. Pure wacky entertainment!!"
1,Jewish Cooking Made Slim,Very disappointed...Thought I was ordering a book with a different title...was not cost-effective for me to return.
5,I love maps,"Already have an Atlas, topo CD set of Northeast, Garmin GPS Vista with topo/street maps. Once I found these Gazetteers, I bought one for every state in New England and New York. Each of the above provide different levels of information and alternative routes and access to various locations, often places with no direct road or trails. The gazatteers provide fast detail access to areas in question over the GPS or atlas and are invaluable to me while in the vehical. Although, the GPS is my lifeline away from the vehical, the gazatteers are large and not weather resistant."
1,New York Atlas,This is an absolutely awful atlas. Does not show road detail clearly. I think my next step will be to return it.
1,Cheap but made in china,"Unless you love replacing them every 6-12 thousand miles, stay away and find something made in US, Mexico, or Canada. Made in China CV boots are made of non-ozone resistant rubber and deteriorate fast."
5,Date With Destiny??,"Do we create our own destiny? Do our minds create our own heaven or hell? Is is human nature to always want more? Once success is achieved, will fulfillment be ours?These questions and more come to mind as we follow one mans journey through a ""sampling"" of his life. Going through the motions of daily living, he questions life, his life and finds some answers from from a friendly ""soul"". Humorous and entertaining, I would recommend this to anyone who questions life, death and his or her daily existence."
2,Not very good,"I usually LOVE this type of movie, BUT this one was NOT good at all. It's boring and has a very bad ending. I was looking to see if there was another dvd set that I missed...no, the end is the end and it was SO BAD. The acting is really bad also. The only good part of this movie is the scenery."
5,Great Dog Treats,My dog loves these. I'm bummed that Amazon isn't carrying them anymore. I bought 3 bottles while I could.
3,Not so good but not so bad.,"Not so good but not so bad. Too heavy and easily rusted; however, I'll still use it. I rate three star"
5,"Lodge Pro Logic 14"" Iron Wok","What more can I say, the product arrived quickly and was well packaged. We've used it a few times and have had no issues. The quality is what I would expect from a Lodge."
3,I hope it is a ready to use seasoned wok.,"The wok is good, the size way large for me. And the seasoning is a pain! I want a smaller sized, seasoned ready to use one which will be helpful for my life. And it is super heavy!! You barely can move it to wash after you cook a big meal. Won't buy this anymore. sorry..."
1,Cast Iron has it's limitations,"While historically woks are made out of a form of cast iron. This is not the same cast iron material composition that you will find in the classic cast iron pans and dutch ovens. I have several cast iron items from Lodge which I am very pleased with. This is not one of them.I may not be an expert at cooking. But using this kind of cast iron wok seems to limit the capabilities of the wok concept. It takes a very long time to heat up and cool down. Once hot, it has a ferocious heat content which cooks well. But I think that's only one aspect of the Wok.Overall, I can't recommend that this is a good combination of materials and design. Cast Iron is great for a lot of other things in the kitchen, but perhaps the Chinese Wok of the more traditional design is the way to go."
5,great once it's hot,"It's a very large wok, takes about 15 mins to heat up on low heat, but then it's uniformly hot, cooks very well. The ring we bought for it would not sit on our gas stove grates (or on stove without grates) so we just put the wok directly on the stove grate. There is a small flat area at the bottom which will allow it to sit flat as long as you're careful."
4,Another gift for hubby!,This was another Christmas present for my husband. It comes already seasoned. He was quite excited about this one. And it is heavy!
5,"My favorite cooking tool, ever!","I was a professional cook some years back & then the main cook for my family for some more years. I have a huge collection of kitchen gear. THIS THING is my favorite kitchen tool. Its mass is very important, especially when using a consumer level stovetop - you can heat this up before starting your stir-fry and the stored heat prevents that dreaded cool-down that happens with a formed sheet-metal type of wok. Terrific!"
5,Lodge Pro-Logic 14 Inch Cast Iron Wok with Loop Handles,"The cast iron wok cooks hot and evenly. The wok can be used on gas or an electric stove. Very heavy, good quality pan which will last the rest of my life."
5,What a great wok,"If you have an electric stove, this item is for you. Even if you have a gas stove, this item is for you. I have been cooking with a carbon steel wok for years and it was not till after I watched several video's on wok cooking and tested this wok out that I realized I was not stir frying. I was steam frying instead. Oh what a difference this wok makes when it comes to searing the meat and staying hot enough to sizzle/sear the whole time I am cooking. It is not quite non-stick just yet, but I have only cooked in it three times since it came the other day, but I can see it is getting better and easier for clean-up. I am very satisfied with this wok and glad to have it. Thank you lodge for making this. Someone needs to do the same with a carbon steel wok. Flat bottom woks on an electric stove just don't cut it when it comes to searing the meat or your food. I have been missing out for years."
5,Best WOK ever...,"So I've had a dozen or so WOKs but none that hold the heat so well and cook so evenly. I use it mainly on the gas burner with the high heats, where all the others just don't do well at all, and am thoroughly impressed by it.The flat bottom does justice when on a traditional electric range and is just as effective in cooking.I wouldn't buy any other WOK after getting this one, unless of course I need a second duplicate one."
5,Lodge cast iron wok,"If you can afford one, don't even think about any others. After cooking fill it with HOT water and swirl it with a stiff plastic brush and it cleans right up, usually. The more seasoned it is the better it cleans so it will take awhile to really get it tuned up like teflon. If you have vulcanized something to it just let it soak for awhile, then go after it with the brush. One thing about cast iron is you can sand blast it and start over. I have one and bought one for my daughter. All other Lodge cast iron products are top shelf."
2,not worthy of the money.,"This wok comes with dings and dents. the bottom burned and rusted starting from the first use. It is very heavy as you would expect from a cast iron wok. Overall, the quality does not live up to the brand. Very dissapointed."
3,Ths wok is okay!,This wok is very heavy and rusts when left in water. Not easy to clean but it cooks okay. If I had it to do over again I would have bought a wok that was easy to clean & light weight.
2,be caution about the pre-seasoned 'coat' and not work well for regular burner,"The build quality of this wok is great.But it doesn't work well on electric stove burner at all; only bottom of the wok hot, extremely uneven heated.I think it would work great on gas burner.Also this wok is pre-seasoned. I tried to season it in oven after I got it brand new, the pre-seasoned coat was melted. see some pics I uploaded."
4,very sturdy but a little too heavy for me,"I bought this about 1 month ago, liked it so far, since I am very short 5'2'', so this wok is a little too heavy for me to move from the stove to the sink when I need to cook more than 2 dishes"
5,Wonderful,Bought this for a friend. He loves it uses it almost daily. What's not to love all lodge cast iron products are great
3,Unacceptable warranty policy,"I purchased three of this item, 2 as gifts, and 1 for myself. My weather station and one which I gifted work fine, and I am very pleased with mine. However, one gifted weather station does not work at all, and the receiver was told that he has to return the station, pay for shipping, and wait for it to be repaired. I feel any reputable, customer-oriented company would immediately send out a new item and ask the customer to return the defective one. So my relative does not have the use of his Christmas gift until the company gets around to repairing and returning it. Furthermore, making contact with a live person to determine the necessary action took far too much time. I probably would not buy another LaCrosse product based on this experience, no matter how good the product is. The company should be more customer-sensitive."
1,Avoid this book!,"'Blue fires' is an example of wild speculation morphing into 'fact'. Hyland clearly has little understanding of physics, aerodynamics, history, propulsion systems, geography and logic - all areas in which a passing acqaintance would be of benefit before trying to write this book. Readers interested in Nazi technology of world war two should not waste their time on this 'novel' There are many well-researched books out there on this area, as well as several scholarly web-sites. Look else-where!"
5,A must have for jazz fans,I have downloaded an incredible amount of Henry Mancini music onto my Amazon Kindle Fire. This is the 1st album I downloaded onto it and frankly it is the first one I always go back and listen to for incredible stereo sound. Dreamville is my favorite. I am absolutely no jazz critic but the piano and instrumental on this is just amazing. I highly recommend this album to anyone you will not be disappointed.
1,"if you want the original sound, DON'T BUY THIS RE-ISSUE!!","this has to be one of the WORST transfers i have ever heard. it took me back to the days when LP manufacturers were pressing LPs with ""simulated stereo"". i compared it to the original pressing because i hoped that my ears were mistaken, however sadly they were not, and i gave the cd away. all of the dynamic and life has been sucked out of this recording. fortunately i have the LP. i will ever beware of buddha products."
5,Absolute perfection,"The other side of the '50s -- sexy, naughty, and very, very nice. Mancini's compositions place him in the top tier, and his selection of musicians is incredible. Never again has such talent been brought together in the jazz arena. Listening to this album last night for the first time in 20 years was a treat I will repeat as often as possible."
5,Great Music,"The music to Peter Gunn is superb. This is great, cool jazz perfect for easy listening, romantic dinners, and appreciation of great musicians playing some of Mancini's best compositions. Mancini's smooth blending of flutes and French horns is beautiful."
4,Brings back the memories,This is a truly enjoyable CD. We used to listen to it quite often back in the day. I recommend it.
2,"Great Music, Bad Re-mastering","The music is terrific, but the sound on this Buddha re-mastering is not. I bought this, gave it away, and purchased the import RCA disc. The RCA import has excellent sound, the brass leaps out of the speakers, there is much fuller dynamic range, and it also has all 24 tracks from the two original Peter Gunn albums. Don't settle for this Buddha disc, and get the RCA import here at amazon. If you must have this disc, realize the sound is much better with a quality re-mastering. The Peter Gunn music is fun jazz with pop touches, sure to be enjoyed by most listeners."
5,Listen carefully...,"Okay, so everyone already knows that ""Peter Gunn"" is one of the great movie (TV) themes of all time, the essence of bad-ass before the term bad-ass was fit to print.But next time you hear a crappy recording from the 60's or early 70's on CD, and someone tries to tell you they just didn't have the recording technology in those days, give a listen to what Henry Mancini did in a soundstage over 50 years ago.There have been a number of great covers, including the Blues Brothers, but nobody actually improves on Mancini's classic."
1,Very disappointed,"The sunburst vanity wall mirror I ordered was not at all what the picture indicated. The moment I took it out of the box I was disappointed. It looks cheap and not something I would put up on my wall. I am sending it back and I not only lost the $45.00 shipping cost but a 15% restocking fee. I also have to pay for the shipping back. Since I got burned bad this time, I don't think I will be ordering online again."
4,a great ska-punk album,"Area 7 have promised much with their earlier EP releases and, on Bitter & Twisted, they have delivered. Starting with their classic up-beat take on political racism, Bitter Words, they move through a variety of modes, the thunderous ska-punk attack of Second-Class Citizen, the pop-sensibility of Big Ben, the old-style jamaican ska of Blind, the rousingly anthemic Unsung Hero, the reggae-bop take on the Cure's Boys Don't Cry (which is a dead-set classic), to the chaotic exuberance of Himbo. Across this range, they are a tight unit, the horn lines are clear and brilliant and the bass production values are sensational. They avoid the messier moments of ska-core, and the worst excesses of skate-punk: at their heart is upbeat ska, for getting onto the floor and dancing. These guys are skanking live, encouraging a fantastic circle-mosh, and the crowd goes off. Get the CD. It has some sure-fire gems. And get along to see the band when they're next near you."
4,Decent early 80s British sitcom,"Years ago UK Television station ITV used to screen numerous comedies. You would never have thought it judging by the stuff they screen today.Back in 1982-83 ITV contractor Yorkshire Television made 14 episodes of The Bounder, a sitcom for all the family. Starring Peter Bowles as Howard, a fraudster just released from prison, and George Cole as his brother in law. Howard goes to live with his sister Mary upon release from jail and ends up in all sorts of comical capers. Bowles and Cole certainly add gravitas to the programme.This is worth a watch as it has never been repeated as far as I am aware and I never saw it during the original run.For around six hours of gentle old fashioned comedy, this is a boxset worth watching.Enjoy!"
1,poor performer,"Did not perform adequately with very uneven dispersal of water. A junk item, not worth purchasing. I intended it as an underground soaker, and it flooded some areas, leaving others poorly irrigated."
3,A Difficult read,"I bought this book for information on the Lincoln County wars and the A.J.Fountain murder. There is little on the Lincoln County Wars. As for the Fountain family history and murder, the author seems more interested in getting every name of every participant, however minor, crammed into the pages of this book. The first chapters are a difficult read because of this. There is a great deal of information on the Oliver Lee / Sen. Albert Fall history and relationship, but it is very convoluted as it pertains to the Fountain Murder. The Fountain murder is covered extensively right through to the trial and verdict. As I now live in Las Cruces, I found it really interesting how many surrounding places got there names,and I am now, more than ever, anxious to do more exploring."
4,This is great !!!,"This is a virtuoso mexican pianist that started from an early age: 5 years old! I guess she's promoting mexican and latin-american classic music through her recordings. This one specially joins the talents of another great mexican artist, Fernando, and her's. I prefer another of her recordings, a more recent one, Latin-American Music for PianoVol. 2... Check it out!"
5,Best Movie!!,This has to be my all time favorite cartoon movie of my childhood.. you can not go wrong with this movie
4,My favorite American Tail carttoon sequel !,"Love the storyline and all the different characters , The Fievel save the west !"
5,Awesome animated movie finally on DVD!,"What a great film! Just as good as the original but geared more towards kids. With another amazing score from James Horner, how can you go wrong?"
4,booja,"Alright, I use to have this movie as a child. I had recently bought Fievel goes west in a combo pack at traget when I realised that it was not the same fievel that I grew up with. The other Fievel has no wilie burp and no train (it has a boat instead). Now that I've seen them both I must say that I I like this one the best. I found it the most entertaing and I STILL love it. I bought it to share a memory with my son and he loves tiger and Willie Burp. I say BOOJA to that fact that I finally found the correct movie in all it's western glory."
3,Shame On Universal,"Shame on Universal for releasing this wonderful film in Pan & Scan only! It was released in Widescreen for laserdisc, so why not DVD?Yet another botched DVD release from Universal (E.T., Back To The Future, Monty Python's Meaning Of Life, etc.).Let's hope the executives at NBC can turn this out of control home video division around when they take the reigns after the acquisition has been completed."
2,"Uh, Fievel...come back east.","For those of you who loved the original, and don't want to see the disspointment and the fact that this didn't live up to the first one at all, just skip this one nd move on the the third and fourth ones.Don Bluth should've watched who he gave the American Tail rights to. To get away from the violence of New York and to find new opportunity, the Mousekewitzes take a train out west to a town called Green River. Fievel gets tossed overboard mid-way through the journey.This is exactly what it appears to be - a bad western movie. The plot isn't good, the story never really gets off the ground, and while Dreams to Dream s nice, it's nothing special. So just skip this one - its not very well done at all."
1,Boring!!,"What's so great about this slow-moving and pointless movie?! It didn't keep my attention for even ten minutes!! And I'm usually good about these things, too...Tanya [is weak] at singing. The whole thing bored me to death. No one in my family ever watches this, so I thought I'd give it a try. I'm glad I did. Now I know Bluth has made MANY better movies."
1,Terrible,"This vacuum cleaner is a cheap piece of junk --- poorly made with little suction! I purchased it, sight unseen and without doing any research, because I wanted to have a second vacuum for the upstairs bedrooms for some light daily cleaning and thought any $100 machine (with a 12 amp motor) could corral a few dust bunnies, boy, was I wrong. Save yourself some money and aggravation and pass on this one."
2,Very cheaply made,"This vacuum worked okay for the first few months, but the handle to the dirt tank broke almost immediately. Then the wheels fell off the floor attachment. Then the hose came apart. I've had it about 18 months and used it once a week. The hose disintegration rendered it unusable. Would I have spent the $70 on it if I had known it would fail that quickly? Probably not. I am going to replace it with something sturdier, even if it costs me more."
3,my return,i would like to have my money back. i sent this product back to you last week. this product is fine on floors but not carpet. this is why i purchased it. but am disappointed in the pick up on carpet.
3,Historical Insight Good; Some Weak Contributions Elsewhere,"The quality of this book varies as the contributions come from myriad contributors some of whom have more substance and accuracy than others. The historical sections are the strongest part of the book. It helps to see for yourself what a primary source says rather than have another writer ""spin"" their meaning.Near the end this strength gives way to bogus content. Substance is replaced with opinion in heavy doses. Based on this mix I give this book an average rating. It has some positives coupled with weak areas."
3,"Works OK, Buy at a Discount","We use these pans to cook eggs. Ok, so we're not gourmet chefs. And, yes, the eggs stick a little in the grooves after a while, too. But they are excellent pans as far as heat dispersement goes and the non-stick surface does work well. I personally do not like the grooves. I prefer the Anolon brand which is groove-free. But, I purchased this particular pan on sale ... , and that was a fantastic bargain here at amazon.com. I would say that if you are going to pay more ... for this piece of kitchen hardware it is not worth the money. It is pretty, though. So, if you're out to impress your friends and don't cook a lot and the price is right go for it...otherwise give Anolon a shot."
2,I've owned a set for over 5 years,"Circulon's signature groves work well for the first few years keeping damage to the non-stick surface coating to a minimum. However, after four to five years of regular use the non-stick surface loses its effectiveness and these groves then become nearly impossible to clean. We had bought an entire Circulon set and found the pots that we used regularly all failed within a 1 year from each other.We always use plastic cookware and never set the stove to more than medium when using any non-stick pot. We don't use any oil when cooking."
4,"A good book, if Tillis was fairer.","Georgina Underwood needed her job, her step-family depended on her help with money.But when the company was sold by Mr. Patton, to Mr Rankin, he wanted to get rid of Georgina, because he was told she was having an affair with his daughter Lora's husband Desmond Warner, Desmond was a friend to Georgina and nothing more.Tillis York.When the place was sold one of the reasons it took so long was because Mr. Rankin wanted to get Georgina out.Mr. Patton wanted her to keep her job, because he knew about Georgina's family problems.Tillis was determined to get rid of Georgina, so he worked her to the bone, but Georgina hung in there.Then Tillis found out about Georgina's family, and he told her she could keep her job if she pretended to be engaged to him.Georgina had no choice but to go along with this.Before long Georgina fell in love with Tillis, and Tillis was in love with Georgina all along."
3,Fun But Tiring,Unlike some i have seen no glitches in this game and find the story and great graphics enough to keep me interested. However this game quickly turns from action to puzzle solving and gets a bit boring after the first level. Great graphics and good controls but being a fan of fast paced shooters i found it a bit less than i hoped. RPG fans will love it and while im not saying i dont like it i am saying be sure of what you like before purchase.
5,"What can I say, this is a classic.","Even though it's not very old, this game is a classic, the adventure is truly a blast, I've beaten this game over 5 times in less than the 2 years I've owned it. The basic plot of this game is that you (Jen) and your side-kick (Scree) explore four different highly detailed realms. Forest, water, haunted, and fire, is what I like to call them, can't remember the real names of them, and my PS2 isn't connected so I can't check, but basically those are what the reamls are. They each take well over an hour to beat, even when you know what you're doing. Another great feature in this game, is you get to control your side-kick ""Scree"" whenever you like, so basically you have 2 characters to pick from, having to switch to progress in the game. Ifyou don't already own this game, definitely pick it up, it's worth every penny."
1,Clunky clunky clunky,"The combat system in this game is sad, slow and clunky. In a the modern age of better, more smooth combat systems, this one is depressingly bad. I can typically tough it out for an interesting storyline, but I had to put this one down. Definitely not recommended."
3,Primal: Average but beautiful.,"Primal at its heart is a run-of-the-mill linear adventure. It's obvious the developers were going for the interactive movie experience. The gameplay in Primal is average but it's the story and the beautifully animated cut-scenes and quality voice acting that elevate this game from cookie-cutter adventure to an entertaining game. This is one of the best looking games on the playstation 2, with character models and animation unequaled by any other PS2 game. In fact the character models in this game are at least as good or better than most next-gen games. If your looking for a deep engrossing movie-like experience but don't mind just average gameplay, you should check this game out. Now that it's only $10 for a new copy, it's well worth the price."
2,lame,"game tries to be ""cool"" but falls way flat. the main girl voice actor is incredibly annoying, its the first time i ever skipped cut scenes i hadnt seen before. her dialog is just so lame, they tried sooo hard to make this game ""hip"", but ended up being about as hip as my grandmother doing the macarena"
2,glitch galore,"I was really having fun with this game. The graphics are pretty good and it kept me going, trying to figure out where to go and what to do. It gets sort of tedious after awhile having to go back and forth and fighting is sort of dull, but I did enjoy playing it. I started running into glitches once I got into the second world. I hade to restart once because for some reason I got stuck in some ""nowhere zone"" with no way out. Then right after I fight the boss and save, I go to the top of this tower where only the other character ""scree"" can get to. The only problem is, I cannot select him no matter what I do. So needless to say, I've come all this way for nothing so I am very disapointed indeed."
5,Outstanding Game,"This is by far the best PS2 game i have ever played. the story line and the graphics are totaly cool, and the intovative controls are easy to use. the contorls are simmaler to that of the Zelda games so you do not have to worry about jumping and suff like that. This game offers a great blance between action and puzzel solving.the music in the game comes on during a fight then it goes off again after the fight so most of the time you are playing in dead silence, however that only adds to creepy effect that the different worlds have.This game will keep you comming back to it, and that is what a game should do."
1,love stinks,"this is possibly the most sickening compilation i've ever heard. while there are some good bands and singers on this cd, the songs are their weakest. if you love silly love songs like ""i wan't to make it with you"" then this cd is for you."
3,"good functions, poor housing","The functions for both lights are great. However, I have a hard time to put them on my new bike. Managed to do it but after a few rides, I end up having a useless headlight and lost tail light. This is due to:1) head light only have 22 - 26 mm mounting clamp, which is good for my old road bike. My new Marin mountain bike comes with 31.8mm handle bar. Which makes it impossible to mount the head light on.2) tail light has really bad housing design -- very easy to come apart. I lost my tail light during the last outdoor trip. This is why I am writing this review -- I am in the moment of buying another light and for sure I am not buying this one again."
1,SO SAD,"I ASKED FOR A LIGHT SET WITH ALL THE LIGHTS NOT JUST ONE, ALTHOUGH IT DID WORK IT WAS JUST A SINGLE PRODUCT"
2,"Cheap, brittle parts. poor design, bright lights","I went through two lights in one week during the winter. The cheap plastic breaks easily. The shells are hard to separate to change batteries. The attachments to the bicycle break. The light is bright, but not worth the price. The rear light is broken. The front is held by packing tape. However, the lights are bright and good for protection. Shame on Bell. Spend a few more dollars for better quality that will last."
1,"OK rear tail light, poor quality headlight","The tail light has worked well for quite some time, has many light modes, and stays on the bike well, but its construction is not that great so I'm just waiting. The headlight is another story.This was given to me as a gift and that's the only reason I have it. I've never known Bell to make quality bike parts and the headlight is no exception. As others have noted, the lamp mounting design is terrible where it easily falls off while you are riding and ends-up into a bunch of pieces when it hits the ground or you run over it.I've been able to keep mine working by taping it together, but finally I took a fall the other day and the base of the light that slides on to the handlebar clip broke into a million pieces (very cheap plastic construction) and no amount of tape/glue/etc will ever hold it. Also had on my bike a Cat Eye LED light (that I've had for years) that took even more force from the fall and it wasn't even scratched."
3,No muy resistente,"El material no esta hecho para soportar un golpe o una caida fuerte, esta bien si no entras en terrenos de montana, pero un caida no la soporta, se quiebra."
2,Hard to keep on the bike,"This is an overall good light. The only problem with it is the clamps that are provided. If dropped, the light breaks into pieces that can be put back together again, but that takes time. Is not user friendly to other clamps. The light is good but the clamps make it not worth the purchase."
2,DOA,"The front light was DOA and the back light took me a day to figure out. I resorted to finding instructions written by previous owners.The back light seems to be working just fine. I've not yet mounted it but that appears to be the consensus with previous reviewers. Flipping through the various light modes I felt like Kate Reid in the Andromeda Strain. It's BRIGHT & I'm seeing more stars than this product's reviews.You get what you pay for, basically."
5,Good Night-Riding Lights.,"Several light patterns for visibility, very bright when turned to steady on with no flashing. Got it for my wife's hybrid bike and it works very well, no issues at all, I'm completely satisfied."
2,Neither piece fit my bike,"The lights on this thing work. That's nice. However, neither of the fittings are big enough to fit my bike. I have an Iron Horse Competition mountain bike. So unless you have relatively thin handlebars and seat rod, I'm avoid this product. I'm stuck with a useless set."
4,"If you are not a gear geek, this will do the job.","I have a philosophy about my new commuting experience that can be summed up as visibility trumps cool. If you are rich or if you are seriously touring at night (I guess folks do that) go drop a couple of hundred on a fancy light. Essentially, this will do. The Bell light makes light and flashes. I am more concerned with people seeing me at dusk or dawn than I am lighting up the road. It is fairly cheap construction, but it shouldn't take a lot of pounding riding back and forth to work. The light is inexpensive and it works. If you are concerned with batteries and the environment, buy a generator light... or at least rechargeable batteries for this one."
3,Not for kids that drop their bikes down,"I purchased 3 of these for my 5 year old triplets.2 are still intact. The other busted when the bike got dropped down to the ground. It's got a rubber insert that's supposed to help make it ""hug"" the bar when you tighten it on, but sometimes it wants to squeeze right out of there and then the light starts flipping around loose. I don't think you can get it tight enough with out this little thing. luckily we found the one tha popped out.Other than that, it's a bright lite with lots of fancy light rythms."
2,Not enough light for back roads.,"My husband bought this for me for my commute home from work. Although it is fine on main city streets, once I turned onto my cross street, (no street lights) I was pretty much on my own in the dark. Cars would be able to see the light in the dark, but it wasn't powerful enough to illuminate the street before me. I am returning it after one use."
3,Does not play well with rechargeable batteries.,"We use Ni-MH rechargeables, but the headlight does not play well with them. The batteries fit in the housing, but the upper, plastic cover has two ridges to help secure the batteries down; this is engineered for disposable alkaline batteries. I had to shave down the housing to create enough space for the slightly bigger rechargeable batteries.However, the light itself is pretty good, and seems to hold up fairly well to abuse. In my urban, well lighted area, the LEDs are enough to see by and be seen by, so I can get a lot of use out of one charge. I pop the light off when I put the bike on the bus rack so that it doesn't get lost, but the holder is pretty strong.Bell would do well to re-engineer this for Ni-MH/Ni-CD batteries."
2,You get what you pay for -- cheap and fragile,"Very poorly constructed switch. Press it just a little too hard and its internal glue breaks. After that it lets rainwater in to short everything out. Not a terrible unit for the price if you are very careful with it and never use it in the rain. Flashing mode is adequate for letting people see you, but not otherwise particularly bright. It's an inexpensive unit that may last a couple of months."
5,GREAT DEAL,"Good buy, works great,highly recommend this seller too. Product came as promised. These lights are a steal as compared with others which are priced too high. Bought two for my twin teens and they are well pleased. THANKS SELLER"
3,Poor quality--great customer service,"After receiving this light set in the mail, I was disappointed to see that the quality was rather poor. The back light worked just fine, but two of the four settings on the front light didn't work at all. After waiting far too long to contact the seller about the defective product, they quickly responded by sending me an entirely new set of lights without needing me to ship back my defective ones. And thankfully--this second set works just fine. I wish I would have invested a little more money into a more quality set of lights, but on a grad student budget, this one will work just fine."
3,"i thought it was great, until...","i thought it was great until it broke :( i went forward in to my handle bars and caught it with my hip, it snapped clean off , didn't even put up a fight. so i guess as long as you never crash it's great! high and low beams work really well and the high beam is really bright. the led option is nice too. im going to buy something a little more sturdy though this time."
1,not durable.,"Fell apart the very first day I used it. I happened to hit a small bump in the road, since the head light contained 4 AA batteries it was heavy and broke off the mounting. Hit the the road and smashed into pieces. I would not recommend at all."
3,A Disappointment of Jazz Fusion Mediocrity,"Jazz fusion is my favorite genre. However, with this album Frank Gambale deals subpar work. This is clearly not what attracts me to the jazz fusion genre. Some folks may like it, and it is not as if I would have a problem with that. I'll be honest, Frank Gambale is an amazing guitarist, but the song writing on this is terrible. However, I don't see Thunder from Down Under blazing any trails for the jazz fusion genre. Gambale would do better to pair himself with a song writer.So what is with the stars anyway? That is, why not 1 star instead of 3. That is because these musicians are actually playing sophisticated music from their hearts. As I have said before, an album need only be in the genre of what I would call jazz fusion to get 3 stars from me, and that is simply because I love it so much. Maybe I would change that if there was more jazz fusion out there, and possibly give 1 or 2 star ratings, but it is not as if I look forward to such a world."
5,The Cape Verdean Divia,Cesaria is a great singer who has shared the beauty of Cabo Verde through her music. Her music is insperational and moving even if you do not understand the lyrics. Cesaria has inspired many Cape Verden artists such as Grace Evora. If you enjoy listening to her music and feel moved then I urge you to explore the rest of our culture through other artists.
5,This CD is an essential for those who love Cesaria Evora,"Very few performers have left me such a lasting impression. Her natural, unassuming style is unforgettable. In addition to the traditional cape verdian mornas, Cesaria's magical voice is backed this time by some excellent arrangements in an unusual and perfect blend of traditional cape verdean and cuban music patterns, performed by an ""all star"" group."
5,Cafe Atlantico,"I went to see Cesaria Evora perform in Berkeley a few months ago.My boyfriend and I had forgotten how sweet her singing was.He wanted to go out and buy 1 CD of her music. Through Amazon.com, I wasable to purchase 3 for just alittle bit above his price. I am definitely verrry happy!"
3,Not even Jehovah's Witnesses pay for their music!!!,"Wow, what a rip off!! Almost two hundred bucks for a CD thats totally free? You can order thru a local congregation for FREE!! Or even better, download it yourself for FREE at www.jw.orgDONT BUY!!!"
2,Not enough explanation and examples,"I was expecting too much of this book. I thought I would get a detail difference between similar particles. Isn't that why we purchase this book at the first place. But the explanation is so short. And really not clear enough to understand completely the particle. It's good that it has Exercises. But, I'd rather have more detail and examples of the comparison particles.Get another particle book if you're expecting to mastered the difference between particles. I don't recommend this one."
4,Can be recommended,"I first checked out the author'sAll About Particles: A Handbook of Japanese Function Words (Power Japanese Series) (Kodansha's Children's Classics). I didn't like that book.This new book by the same author basically covers the same ground, some 50-60 particles. However, it organised by topics instead of alphabetically. That makes the understanding and learning so much easier."
5,Give it up for one of Gangsta rap's founding fathers,"This is a very good album by Scarface. Scarface has always been one of the best rappers of all time and he prooves it here. The only problem is that he has two other rappers on as well but they both are good. This is a very good album and probably could be one of the best albums of the year, but I wish that he would release another solo album with just him on."
1,Beware - pulls - 4 good out of 50 in my order - Disappointed - Test upon arrival,"Item arrived timely and were the number and type of batteries advertised, but were pulls and most were dead or tested bad. Only 4 out of 50 tested good. I did not find the poor quality until after the return window a few days ago. Therefore, I suggest you either don't order these or test upon arrival and return if you get a bum bunch like me.The batteries would have been fine, if they were not dead or tested as ""Replace"" when received."
1,Unacceptable packaging,"As other reviews have pointed out, this item may come in a very flimsy plastic pack. On arrival, the batteries will all be jumbled up, possibly shorting out. Next time I'll make sure to order batteries that come in smarter packaging..."
2,not worth the price,"Did not come in the package that was shown, most of product was loose in the package, was missing 4 batteries, & about 10 so far were dead. NOT very happy, paid more for postage & handling than what they were worth. do your self a favor & buy at nearest target."
1,35 of 50 were dead on arrival.,Received exactly what I paid. Cheap price for very cheap/poor product. The title says it all. Tried the dead 35 numerous times in a two devices that I knew worked I have finally given up.
3,You Get What You Pay For,"The batteries are hit-and-miss. Some work very well and have a lot of charge. Some of the batteries are dead on arrival. Some of the batteries have very little charge. However, they are cheaper than the other batteries listed.One problem is the packaging; the batteries arrive in a flimsy, taped together plastic packages that allows them to be crushed and move around during shipment. It is no wonder that some people have reported exploding batteries. What most likely happened is that the batteries touched during shipment."
5,Great Value,"I was able to purchase 50 of these batteries for less than the price of 2 at Target, so I thought what do I have to loose. I have used the batteries in kids books and toys. The batteries work. They may not last as long as the originals, but I have 40 left so who cares. Even if half the batteries were bad, it is still cheaper than buying them at a local store."
5,Great for them money,"These batteries were hard for me to find in the store. I use them in my little night lights so that I can read at night. The price was awesome for the number of batteries that you get. I should have ordered more, but wanted to make sure that they would work first since the number was replacing the original number."
1,Weak Batteries,"These batteries are weak. I used them to replace batteries in some LED Santa hats and they are too weak to make the blue LEDs light up. When I switched them out with batteries from a newly purchased hat, all the lights lit up more brightly."
3,50 Pack Batteries,OK for the price. They do not last as long as premium batteries and would not recommend for use in important or high drain devices.I am using them in Christmas ornaments and am pleased. For the price paid ($4.49 + free shipping) I would recommend to any one that has LED type Christmas decorations or similar devices.
3,Need to improve the packaging,"When shipment arrived, some of the cells were dislocated from it's slot, and touched to other dislocated cells, might cause some short."
1,Awful!,"The batteries came in a padded mailer that was in good shape. But inside, the batteries were strewn all over the place. Of the 50 batteries, 10 had come apart and spilled something like graphite dust all over. I tested the remaining batteries. Only 13 tested okay. But when I put them in my device, they lasted about 5 minutes. I'm sure glad I paid less than $4 for these batteries, because it was a complete waste of money."
4,no problems,"I ordered these despite the numerous reviews about exploded batteries. I figured even if half of the batteries worked, it was a bargain. They took a long time to get in, but otherwise I had no problem with them. None of the batteries were busted on delivery and I have lots of toys working again that I didn't think I'd ever fix! These batteries are a bargain!"
1,Should've listened to the reviews,"Batteries came with some of them already busted. Looks scary. The ones that didn't pop still work, but I wouldn't put it in my stuff. Guess I learned my lesson on not heeding the warnings in the reviews."
1,"Cheap, Dangerous Garbage","Figured for $5 I'd ignore the 1 star reviews. You get what you pay for. One battery has already popped and several others are already swollen. These are cheap, dangerous garbage. Won't bother returning. I'll just order some batteries from a company who does quality control."
1,Incomplete order,"Order arrived in poor plastic container not what on the picture, batteries were all over the box. The most important, instead of 50 I got only 21 battery."
5,"work well, good price","I got these right away, the delivery was very fast. I was worried with some reviews about damaged batteries, or that they explode. I figured if even half were still good they would pay for them selves. Well it's been 2 month and I've used about 25 so far and had no problem. They work well and I was very happy with the price."
1,Batteries Explode,"As others have reported, these batteries explode. Two of the batteries exploded with black power, presumably toxic, all over the inside of a drawer. I don't know if these batteries are unstable from a chemical standpoint and explode or whether they develop an internal short, overheat and then explode. Either way, throw them out."
5,50 Batteries,Arrived quickly. Perfect for nanobots that eat batteries like candy. Great price. 50 for what Wally World wants for 2.
2,Button batteries,Batteries were cheap but don't have strong charges and I'll probably end up throwing most of them out before I can use them.
3,"Mediocre, but cheap.","Not a huge shock, but the life of these batteries is pretty low, but when you get 50 for so cheap, its not bad to change them out every once and a while."
5,So far so good!,These work great! I was skeptical at first since they are so cheap but they really work!!
3,Good for the price.,"Got these batteries for the girlfriend's ""personal massager."" They don't last very long, but for the price they are hard to argue with. Would buy again."
1,Batteries did not work and were hot to the touch!,Many were DOA and very hot to the touch. I am sure several will explode any time now. You get what you pay for!
1,charge does not last !!!,I bought these after the great reviews and the super cheap price...I should have know I would get what I paid for. The first few batteries that I installed worked great. But after just a few short months all of the remaining batteries lost their charge (and they were not by any magnets). Waste of money...buy the name brands that last longer !
5,LR44 batteries,Very satisfied ty very much can't go wrong with the price. i use these batteries for my listen up device.
1,Useless,i wish there was a negative rating I could give. Half of the batteries did not work out of the box. I would not buy them again.
2,BOOM,"Bought these batteries and hoped they came individually packaged. They are not! They are bulk packed on trays of 50 each. So far so good? Well, they arrived half spilled throughout the box and, in fact, one of the batteries had shorted out and actually exploded!!!!! Also, the count was off by 4! Not a good way to do business. Checked a sampling of the remaining batteries and they all seem to be fully charged. So, that's a good thing. No 5 star rating this time! Should have spent a little more and gotten the carded batteries."
5,Priced Right,We use these batteries for Hexbugs. My child can drain these batteries quickly so a large volume and inexpensive product is a must.
1,Disappointed,"These batteries do not last long and carry a weak initial charge. I purchased these as HexBug replacement batteries, but they could not provide the power the bugs needed to move around quickly. Instead we had slow unexciting bugs. Many where DOA."
3,short battery life?,"I bought these batteries for some cute Christmas decorations I am giving to friends for the holiday. Since most folks dont have this type of battery on hand, I bought a few replacements to give along with the decoration so it would at least last all, or at least most of the month. Maybe it is the nature of the decoration (just a LED christmas tree), but the batteries dont seem to last very long. So, its either the strength of the battery or the draw of the decoration, but they need to be replaced more often than I was expecting."
1,Might have been a good deal,"I'm gonna go through this quickly.We got our item today. I ordered these Monday, Nov 28. They arrived exactly 2 days later. The packaging was pathetic and not simple to get into. Plastic holders pressed together, taped, wrapped with a plastic zipper bag and taped again.The batteries didn't respond when we put them in our electronic device. Then we wiped them down and tried again. After two brisk rubdowns in a towel, they worked great.If you're willing to rub each battery clean, this is a good deal for you."
1,short use,The batteries only last for a short time their life is about 4 hours. Which means you change them constantly. Not worth the money. Do not buy these!!!
1,Extremely Disappointed -- Beware!,"Bought this bargain pack (should've known by the price) 2 months ago. Used a few the first time since purchasing them and only 2 out of the pack of 50 were good. All the rest were either completely or nearly dead , according to our voltage tester. Some were even bulged like they were recharged.Live and learn!"
1,Found out why they were so cheap,I ordered these to use with my kids' hexbugs. Most of the batteries in the pack were either dead or almost dead. Big disappointment.
2,Not very good quality,"I bought these as Amazon indicates they will work in the Nano and Hex bug toys. The price seemed too good to be true, when compared to what you pay for the Nano bug batteries in toy stores. I used them for the first time tonight and I was not happy. My son had five Nanos that needed a new battery and I ended up going through ten of these batteries in 20 minutues. Two of the batteries did not work at all. The other eight worked but the Nanos did not seem as ""active"" as usual. Several needed another replacement battery within 10 minutes. I still have forty batteries left so we'll see what happens with them."
2,"weak, poor packaging",Battery packaging was poor and batteries arrived loose w/ some positive and negative terminals touching. Batteries were also weaker than the ones they were replacing.
5,CURE FOR COMON BATTERY PROBLEM,"I have found that virtually all low voltage batteries seem to have a residual residue that can insulate contact surfaces and make you think the battery is dead or produce intermittent energy. These batteries behaved the same way. The cure is to buff all surfaces with a course towel or similar fabric. After buffing, they worked fine. These are an outstanding value and were in my mail box 3 days after ordering."
2,"Batteries worked well, but a few exploded","I didn't have any problems using the batteries in some lavalier mics, but I was shocked to one day see what looked like black powder all over the desk at my office. Further investigation showed the black material had come from my bulk pack of batteries and inside the open package there were two batteries burst completely open.My office mate said she had one day heard a loud bang, like a gunshot or the window cracking. Nope, just these batteries.I threw out the entire batch as a result. Not worth the risk."
1,Great! Update- Not So Great!,"I really needed these for my kids' toys and I couldn't have found them at a better price! Work great, too!Update- Only a few days after I wrote this review, I went to grab some of these batteries for a toy and found that most of the batteries in the pack had exploded! Won't buy again!"
1,ripped off,"I purchased a 50 pack of LR44 alkaline batteries from plexsupply on September 20, 2010....about two months after I had received the package, the batteries starting falling apart IN THE PACKAGE....the center piece of the button cell came off and all the battery acid fell out....I kept the batteries in a drawer in my house so temperature is not a factor...I had to throw every battery away...NEVER PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT....I was required to give this product a rating so I picked the lowest offered, but I would give this item a minus 100 stars at least"
1,Don't waste your time. These don't work.,"Purchased ""From PLEXSUPPLY (Fulfilled by Amazon)"". NONE of the batteries were any good. Tested ""replace"" using a battery tester, and certainly did not work in any of our items these were purchased for. These were not just weak... they were dead. One or two of the batteries tested ""on the line"" between ""replace"" and ""good"" ... but did not have enough juice to power a laser light toy at all. Luckily these were fulfilled by Amazon, so returning is not a problem. Would not recommend."
3,Quanity v. Quality,"As others have already mentioned, there's a mixture of good and bad batteries. I'm already a third of my way through them because there are some batteries that are weak. I was hoping to get a bang for my buck, but next time, I'm going to have to go with quality instead of quantity."
1,Bad,"I have never before bought any product on Amazon that was this bad,the packing that contained the battries was very bad the battries themselves were so bad that some of them had poped apart.Please do not buy this product. Amazon should pull there add."
2,Was not the quality that I was looking for,The batteries came in a timely manner and I received the correct order but the batteries did not hold a charge for long if at all. I was expecting batteries with a longer lifespan.
2,Poor Quality,"It is nice to get all these batteries in one package, but I didn't need any for 5 months and at that point I found that 25 of 50 of them were dead. Even though that is still an OK deal, one would expect all of them would be good. Now it is too late to return them. My advice when dealing with this seller is to check all the batteries upon receipt."
4,78% awesomeness from product,"11 of the 50 batteries received tested between 1.0V-1.3V. We set the undercharged batteries aside and will consume those first. I don't consider this too big of a deal because we still got 39 fully charged batteries for the price of a brand-name 3-pak at local retailers. I'll very likely buy these again. Order turn-around time was very quick, so 100% awesomeness from the seller."
1,Batteries for blinking hats,Disappointed that these have still not arrived. Had hoped that these would arrive early December so that employees could wear blinking Santa hats! Still waiting.......
5,Wow,Great price and these batteries last just as long as the ones I buy individually at the discount stores for the same price as this 50 pack.
3,batteries,"I bought the wrong size batteries. However, they arrived in about two weeks and they appear to be brand new."
1,"Poorly packed, defective product!!!","Of the 50 batteries I received (pretty much all in one pile in a taped together tray), 22 were way below the 1.5 V output expected of these batteries. Only about 10 were up to the full expected new battery voltage.A few work, but I think that the poor packaging shorted many of the batteries in shipping!Or they are just awful batteries as suggested in many of the other recent reviews."
1,Dangerous product. Amazon - stop sellling it.,"As of 1/6/12, there are 29 one star reviews out of 135 for this product. Many of those reviews say the batteries exploded or leaked. Ho can we get Amazon to stop selling this dangerous item?"
5,Quite a deal,All I can say is 50 for the price of two is a very nice deal on this type of power cell.
1,Alkaline cell battery,"I was disappointed in this item...Tianqiu AG13 Alkaline cell battery, It doesn't have enough voltage to power a laser light (for my cat). I should have ordered a premium brand rather than this cheap brand to get enough power."
1,They simply don't work.,"Most of the batteries do not work. Some are even oddly shaped! The couple dollars I spent is not worth the hassle to return....my daughter just wants to use her angel snow globe at night, whom she thinks is my recently deceased mother watching over her. Spending endless time at night finding three of theses little batteries to light up the snow globe is ridiculous. Another lessen to me........don't buy!"
1,Many batteries did not work or had a short life,We bought these batteries thinking they were a great deal. No where on the product review did it say only half of them would work or that there was a possibility that the life would be shorter. We have thrown out about half of the batteries so far at this rate it's not looking to be as good of a deal as I thought. Well lesson learned you get what you pay for.
5,Everything I expected!,"Great price, quick shipping and packaging... just as described! Thank you! Would buy again!"
3,Eh. Only half of them work.,"I bought these to use in some little talking Disney cars I bought my son that each take 3. The first replacement set I put in worked for literally 2 presses of the buttons. Replaced them, the next set worked for about 20 mins of play (note that the original ones worked for about a week and a half worth of play). So far, I've burned through about 30 of these, and they've been here for just over an hour. For $5 shipped, it's not worth complaining about, but you definitely get what you pay for. There's a reason the name brand ones are $6+ for 6 of them."
1,Dead batteries !!,"what kind of online business is this? it tooks a whole 3 weeks to be arrived but that is not the problem. The problem is when I received these batteries .. they are not correctly packed, the batteries were held together by a simple two pieces of plastics which are temporarily taped. but the worst thing is the batteries are all dead. none are working ...and the cost to send it back would cost as much as how much they would sale. !!!I've learn my lesson .. going cheap would pay the price !!!Sucks !!!!"
5,Luckily for me...,"I must be one of the lucky ones, because my battery came in perfect and neatly packed condition. Not like any of the other ones shows in the customers pictures. They work and it was shipping pretty quickly so I'm happy with the products so far. I hope they all work...."
4,Price was right,"The price was good,but they don't last very long.Three in a small candle are about done in 6 hrs.So there good for about one night and the flickering is done,but they are cheap."
2,"Brand new batteries, selfcrack open and spill contents","These batteries were a bargain compared to buying them at retail stores however quite a few of them have opened up and spilled their carbon inerts all over the place. I suppose its better than having battery acid all over, but still, rather disappointing. Seems like they may not have been glued together sufficiently."
4,"great price, exp date not listed","we bought these because the price was a steal! The big box stores charge more than this price for one battery and if you have kids, you have toys and books that take these batteries. Its a super great deal."
4,Great Battery Deal,I have been buying these little 3 cell flashlights from Harbor Freight. When the batteries die I just couldn't see throwing these little LED flash lights away.Here comes the 50xAG13 battery pack. It gave new life to my collection of dead battery flashlights.Great deal. I will come back for more when I need them...
1,not what I orderwed,The product ordered was not the product delivered. I Threw it away because it was not worth the price of returning. I ordered hearing aid batteries size 13. What was delivered was batteries for watches or diabetis testing machine 13eg. Much to big to fit a hearing aid.
2,Waste of money and not as advertized,"These batteries are not very good and about 10 out of 50 were bulging and ready to explode. The package is not what is on the product picture, it is a bulk package and lousy at that. You are better off going to your local flea market and buying cheap batteries."
2,Expect 20% to be defective,"(Note: in spite of the picture showing 5 10-packs with each battery in it's own blister seal compartment, my order was shipped as a single 4.5""x4.5"" flat plastic tray inside of a sealed plastic bag, with a divet in the tray for each battery, but nothing holding the batters in their divets, so they were loose in the bag)10 of the 50 batteries i received were completely defective -- i don't mean they didn't have the proper charge, i mean there weren't even physically assembled properly.several hadn't been properly sealed and fell apart in my hand, a few had aparently cracked open before i got them, and a few were bulging like they could explode at any moment.the package was full of black and green residue from the defective batteries, as well as what looked like heavy corrosion -- i would be amazed if this pacakge had sat on a shelf for less a year before they were shipped to me"
1,Terrible,"Only a handful of these batteries had any life in them at all, and the ones that did were weak. Definitely worth it to spend more money for batteries that actually work. Hate just dumping these shells of batteries into the landfill."
5,good batteries,50 button cells for under $6.00 an excellent deal. They arrived in 5 days packaged in strips of 10 batteries. So far I have used 6 of them in toy telephones. After 3 weeks they're still working fine.
1,Half dead and other half weak,These batteries were sold at an unbelievable price. I should have know better. Half the batteries were dead to begin with and the other half were so weak they only lasted a short while.Don't bother buying these. You are better off paying a little more and getting batteries that actually work.
1,Junk. May even be used. Low charges on the batteries. Buy name brands or waste your money,"The packaging was in a cheap plastic container tray, wrapped in messy clear tape that looked ridiculous. Not a factory package like in the pic. ALSO, THE CHARGES WERE LOW. WAS THIS USED? Seriously, a waste of my time and money. I wish these shady companies would get out of Amazon and stop cheating people. Go buy a name brand for a decent seller and starve these bottom feeder companies out."
4,so many and so cheap,this is much cheaper than you would get anywhere. They work well. I have a ton extra ones from last year. Dont know it they still work.
1,Absolutely ridiculous,"Too good to be true. I never leave reviews, but I felt the need to let people know that this is a scam. Of these 50, about 5 of them actually worked, and not for very long. Not happy at all. Don't waste your money!!"
3,Meh,doesn't last that long..but then again there's 50 of them..you can probably get better quality ones in lesser quantities for the same price
2,Dead Batteries,Most of the batteries are dead or barely working. i needed 3 and i had to go through 9 of them to find 3 that worked.
1,Most of the batteries in my package are dead. DO NOT BUY!!,Most of the batteries in my package are dead. DO NOT BUY!! I would definitely not buy these batteries again.
5,"cheap, but does the job","I was skeptical but I had bought 20 Engergizer glow stick flashlights on clearance and turned out every single one was out of batteries. 3 A76 batteries at walgreens/target/rite aid are $10! For just under $10 I purchased 100 of these babies here on Amazon! They worked great, I didn't receive any duds, they came fast, and the packaging was perfect! So if you need a bunch of these and want a good deal buy them here."
1,Bad,"I bought these a couple months ago and when I needed a few today I was surprised to find that three had exploded at some point and there was black power all over inside the container. I checked the remaining batteries with a meter and found that 42 were bad, two were low, and and three had acceptable voltage. I wasn't expecting stellar batteries for the price but would have preferred ones that didn't explode. I should note that my order arrived in bulk packaging with the batteries arranged in a dimpled plastic tray but not individually constrained. I see they appear to be individually packaged now so maybe they are better."
4,"Uneven film, very erotic at times, but flawed nonetheless","Director Tinto Brass has a very real admiration for the female behind which makes his films enjoyable to watch if you share this attraction. And in this particular film he adds a girl-pursues-girl element which I especially enjoyed!Basically, the plot centers around beautiful blonde Carla (Yuliya Mayarchuk) who moves to London and needs to find a place to stay. Sexy older woman Moira (Francesca Nunzi) develops an immediate attraction for the pretty younger girl and seduces her. This was nice, but I thought the groping was somewhat clumsier than it needed to be. There were several brief scenes involving Carla and Moira, and they were the best parts of this film.The rest of the plotline was mostly forgettable. The Italian-to-English dubbing was so-so at best. I only wish Tinto Brass directed more scenes involving women seducing other women."
2,Not his best film.,"This is a typical Tinto Brass sex comedy. It's nicely filmed and is likely to appeal to Tinto Brass fans. Me, I thought the story was rather uninteresting and the humour not very funny, so the movie overall became rather dull.It's not Tinto Brass's best work. If you're a fan of Tinto Brass, buy it. If you're a casual film viewer or new to Tinto Brass, get ""All Ladies Do It"" or ""Paprika"" instead, before deciding whether to buy this one as well."
4,Show and Tell,"Nicely scripted. A teaser with a bevy of parading beautiful women. The central character is both innocent and sultry in her sexual expressions. All in all, the sexual situations combine mature experiences with younger curiosities."
3,The dvd cover says it all....,The movie itself is just plain silly...although slightly entertaining. Don't waste your money as I did...
4,Nice stuff,Great for latenight viewing.Lots of cute girls and fun soap opera stuff.The film ending a little silly buy I understood it these Italian film are funny sometime it good to have something different in your DVD collectionthat would be consider adult just little above the mainstream stuff that you get from Hollywood.Hot Hollywood actor can't do this kind of stuff without it becomming NC-17 rated.Not even Sex in the City could pull this stuff off....There are a few Armerican film that could match this stuff but you need a studio to make the call like Basic Instinc did back 1992.
2,Just another average soft porn movie,"I bought this movie and paid $25 for it under the impression I was purchasing a MASTER PIECE. Mainly, I bought it because of all the great reviews it got here on Amazon, pretty much everyone rates it above 4 stars.I myself didn't find anything particularly especial about this movie. Cheekie is just another average superficial soft porn movie. All of the carachters are very one dimensional and predictable. Most disappointing is the fact that you keep waiting for the plot to thicken at some point but alas.I personally would've liked to see something develop with Moira's husband or at least something with Moira herself.Even the sex scenes --specially the oral sex ones-- were very badly acted.In my opinion there 100s of European titles that deliver a better punch for your buck.2 out of 5 stars for me and only because the leading character was really beautiful."
2,Might as well watch porn,"This film has about as much sex and nudity as you can get without going to outright X rated pornography. Of course, the cover photo indicates that it is going to be naughty, but the problem I had with it is that there is really not much plot. A young attractive woman seems to have sex with about everyone she meets, male or female, that's about it. Note that the film is in Italian, with English subtitles."
4,Wild Fun. Higly Enjoyable.,"There's not much that I can sway about this movie that'll sway you one way or the other. If you want this movie I suggest you get this edition. You'll have to read subtitles but that's the least of the reasons you bought this movie. It's high fun. The story is thin but the visuals are definitely worth it. Not only does the movie look clean but the it's one very fun movie. I definitely enjoyed it.Recommended.P.S. This edition is one minute longer than the Producer's Cut. If you're willing to read subtitles, I suugest this one."
2,Film only met half of my expectations,"When I bought ""Cheeky"", I had two expectations for it: nudity and plot. The movie lived up to the Nudity expectations that I had for it (from reading other reviews). However, the movie falls ""flat on its face"" when concerning the plot. For me, the plot was uninteresting and about an 1/8 of the way into the film, it started to feel like a chore to finish it.After finishing the movie, I can say that: while there is a bunch of nudity in the film, the ""nude"" factor actually became boring for me about halfway through the film, because all I was thinking by that time was ""please be over (the movie, not the nudity)"", since the plot was that BORING.So, to wrap it up, if you are a Tinto Brass fanatic, then, by all means, try it. If your a normal ""joe-schmoe"" movie watcher (like me), you might find the film very uninteresting (eventhough there is nudity)."
3,6 X 8 Auto speakers,"Purchased these speakers to replace my factory speakers in my work truck. Speakers sound okay, being pushed by an inexpensive stereo system, but may sound even better with a stronger system."
3,Good value,I haven't received this product yet in the mail. Judging from the description they should be exactly what I need for 1999 ford econoline van. I will update this review after I install them.
3,a little like a tin can,"It may be because of my radio, but these speakers sound like a tin can. They also get distorted at a pretty low volume. The radio is a pretty decent JVC detachable face that was in the car when I bought it. The speakers in the doors are factory and they actually sound real good without distortion. Thats why I think it's the speakers. I am going to try a new radio. If I find out this corrects the sound I will update this post."
4,Good value for the money,"This was an upgrade to the factory speakers in my F150. Definitely a BIG improvement. My receiver is an older Alpine 4x35 watt. The speakers do distort a little at a high volume with the bass turned up. However I can turn up the volume at least 33% more then I used to. I may buy another pair for the rear doors (there is nothing there now). I am no audiophile, but for a stock upgrade I think you'll be satisfied."
1,Not a good factory replacement,"I bought these for my 2007 Ford Edge SEL after reading many reviews stating that they are a massive improvement over factory speakers using a stock head unit. My left door speaker was rattling and needed to be replaced. Stating with just that one, I put the new one in and when I tested it, it was much quieter than the rest. Increasing the volume only made it distort. Perhaps it's because I don't have the power (amp) to push them but nonetheless, if your looking to improve on your factory stereo by simply adding these speakers, you'll likely be disappointed. Also, they cannot be returned.per Amazon: ""For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations. Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste."""
5,good speakers,"you cant beat the price for these speakers.fit right in and was abreeze to hook up,sound really great lots of bass"
5,PYLE Speakers at a great price.,Speaker from Amazon.WOW What a big change from the stock speakers that my Ford Ranger came with. They sound so good I just ordered another set for behind my trucks seats.
2,Distort on 40 watts...,"These have ok mids and highs hooked up to my jvc kw-hdr720, but lows distort on just 40 watts! Rated at 360 watts these things would blow out instantly, really surprised ratings are so high on these, but they are super cheap, so go figure. I would not recommend these speakers to anyone. I wish I would have gotten some higher end speakers for my 4 car 6x8's, they really do sound like S%#@T. 2 stars for being $16 each. You get what you pay for with these."
5,replaced stock speakers,replaced stock speakers with these and its amazing for its price. still wanna find some room in my 2000 ranger xlt for my subs
4,Great Speakers!!!,"Overall these speakers are great, I have an 06 F150 and I was looking to replace the stock speakers since they were shot out. For the price you can't beat them, they are great replacements if your are on a budget. At first I was a little skeptical since the price was so low, but I am extremly glad I got them, sound is clean and crisp."
5,"Great sound, greater price!","I bought these after scouring Amazon for some budget speakers that would sound good. Installation was a breeze, everything you need (wires,screws, covers) is included. I hooked them up to a 50wx4 head unit and notice a big difference between these and my stock speakers. If you are looking for a little more ""oomph"" from your speakers but don't want to break the bank getting there, look into these. I was amazed that I got these two days after placing my order (NE to MI), I am very satisfied---hope you are too"
4,Perfect Preschooler Book,My 2-year old daughter and I came accross this book in her Gymboree class and she loved it so much that we had to buy it.
3,A good habit,"This book for me was kind of redundant. He used the same verses over and over to emphasize different ""Habits"". I love the concept of the book, and I have actually referenced it for other studies. It is a great book for someone new to the faith and wants to get the MEAT of how jesus was, without having to read through all the gospels."
4,What about the ladies?,"We read this book as part of a men's small group. It wasn't until we were near the end that someone commented that all of the habits were aimed at men. As a joke we wondered if women couldn't have the Jesus habits...But seriously, this is a pretty easy book. I thought many of his chapters were filled with the Scripture verses written out when really all he needed to do was reference them....If the verses hadn't have been typed out, the book would have been MUCH shorter."
3,Just not as good,"I really enjoyed the first two sets of the Sandbaggers. I purchased them both years ago. When I discovered that a third was finally available, I was very excited. Sadly, set three was very disappointing. It has little of the edge or excitement of the first two. It's just bland. There is nothing new revealed about the characters, and too much time spent on more of the same old, tired political in-fighting. If you are a hard-core fan, you will want to see the final episodes, but there are hit and miss episodes."
5,Simple Perfection,"This is the kind of album that the 'critics' always give three stars because it 'doesn't break new ground.' Granted, there is little virtuosity and no outside harmony. But sometimes it's enough to hear the Master play the melody, and protect the melody for all time. The Hawk can put more intelligence, heart, and soul in a single note than most tenors can squeeze into a whole album of cutting edge jazz. And Hawk's acid sweetness puts all of 'smooth jazz' to shame: the taste of wine compared to cool aid. Like Ben Webster, Ike Quebec, and Gene Ammons, the Hawk is one of the few great balladeers. In fact, he's the one who started it all: he invented THE TONE. A great teacher needs few words: a great musician needs few notes."
3,Nice seat cushions,"The seat cushions are a good value but the blue pictured is different than in person, it's more muted, cornflower blue, I thought it would be a little darker."
2,Interesting i suppose,"i saw this dude at the UCB theater, i wasnt overwhelmed by the plot of the story, seems like its been done, but it might be good, i guess, i mean, i havent read it, i bet his family has though, so, thats good. but hey, he wrote a book, and i havent.i bet sam is awesome at dominoes."
3,East Beats West But Still Not Equal To Volume One,"The set featured on this album originally accompanied that found on Northern Exposure II: West Coast as a two disc offering. Ahhh, strategic marketing.I'd have to say that this set scores an easy second place for the Northern Exposure series. However it still falls short compared to the quality and creativity of the first.3.5/5 stars for this half of Northern Exposure, volume 2."
3,Surprisingly dissapointing,"I find it hard to believe that Sasha and Digweed could conjure something so weak and tasteless.....Nothing in comparison to what they spin at Twilo. They should try making a compilation of friday night hits from Twilo, that is both of them at their best. Those of you who seriously love Sasha and Digweed...stay away from this album, it will ruin your taste for them. Much of the compilations made by the many manhattan dj's seem to be so weak when put on cd...not only weak, but old and dry."
2,A fluke,"I love Sasha and Digweed alone or as a team, but this CD I do not like at all. The tracks sound kind of dated, and Uberzone does not belong on any trace/progressive house CD. I like to think of this CD as something they come up with as a luke-warm response to some record company's demands to make two CDs that everyone would want to buy but that could be sold separately. They turn in an uncharacteristically lackluster performance. Buy the West Coast version, it is much better."
5,an absolute timeless classic,this album sounds every bit as good to me now as it did 5 years ago. perhaps the most soothing and interesting mix that sasha and digweed have compiled on a piece of plastic for their listening fans. the songs were composed from some of the best producers of the time and set a precedent for progressive breaks blending flawlessy with trance to create an effect that will still sound good for years to come.
5,Awakening,"I have only been listening to techno/trance music for a short time, but a friend sent me this CD and I am totally hooked. I can't get enough of Sasha and Digweed, together or separately. What a team!"
2,Wake me up when it's over - ZZZZZZZZZZ!,"Boring!!! After Oakenfold, Paul Van Dyke and even Digweed on Global Underground, this recording was a real disappointment. It is just too slow and too laid back. There may be a few cool sounds on it, but overall, I want my money back."
5,Nice...,"This CD has more energy than the first Northern Exposure CD, but less than its counterpart, the Westcoast edition. On the whole, a great CD, one I'm going to recommend to all trance fans out there!"
5,Absolutely amazing,"This album is funky trance, not the straight hard trance of the West Coast edition. Tracks 1 and 2 are nice, but starting with track 6, this CD is impossible to stop, it will bring you to rapture. The thing that sets this CD apart from other techno mixes, is that they choose songs to which you can both listen and dance. Many of the songs have more ""complicated"" sounds and structures than what you might typically hear in a club. This makes it rewarding for repeated listenings.A lot of the songs have underlying melodies which carry you through the creative rythms. Really every track from 6 on is like that. I would put this CD in my car and blast it loud and let myself be immersed in the swirling sounds, and be carried by the melodies.If you like this, then you might like the first disk of Digweed's Bedrock. It's funkier, like this one, with lots of neat sounds that make you want to listen to it again."
4,The heart of Ireland unvailed,"Patrick McCabe is one of the more extroadinary writers to emmerge from Ireland in recent times, anybody who experienced his sadistic tale, The Butcher's Boy will understand what I mean by this. In Carn, he beautifully unvails his microcosm of Irish life through the inhabitants of one town. McCabe traces the town through poverty, prosperity and finally utter chaos. Blending together a stong Irish dialect, McCabe tells a tale that may sound familar or completely alien. Definately a good read, especially for those political types."
2,Didn't quite do it,"This didn't quite help my wife in getting in to the car seat(we tried it both for the front seat and the rear seat). While it did give her a good hand hold, the bar itself was an impediment to entering the car. Perhaps it might work with a different individual on a different vehicle, but in her case (getting into car from a transporter chair)it unfortunately did not work with our car (Subaru Outback)."
5,Ich bin ein Hog Ridin' Fool,"Yes, from Zap to the 90's lots of material you may have never seen before ...and some classic favorites. Place this one on your coffee table and your guests need not guess where you're comin' from.Actually S. Clay Wilson has ""been around"" since the '60's and is apparently alive and well (somewhere). ""Sometimes I get tired just smilin"" -indeed!Where's volume two?!!?!?!? I know there are some Pervert Pirates stories omitted from this collection!"
2,A Liberal Treatise on how to cure crime,"This book explains why there is crime in the world. If all the money spent on persecuting and prosecuting the poor were, instead, used to feed, clothe, educate, detox, and create jobs there would be no crime. Then the only unhappy people would be the sadistic police, prosecutors, and judges who abuse and entrap the poor."
1,"boring, liberal nonsense","I had high hopes for this book, but after only about twenty pages, it was evident that the author was going to go on and on about how conservative white guys are the cause for all the problems with the Chicago legal system. And yet the author also lets us know early on about the sadistic and cruel black jailers that inhabit the bowels of the Courthouse. These ""jailers of color"" treat every new arrest (no matter what race) like garbage, and yet, white racism is cited early and often in this book as the reason these folks are in jail. Don't bother with this boring, liberal claptrap. Save your money."
4,A real eye opener!,"Courtroom 302 is a frank look at the shocking injustices built into the very foundation of the criminal justice system. The judge and laywers portrayed are identified as some of the best of their class, and they can still be seen turning a blind eye to injustice for the sake of expediency. A word of warning: Courtroom 302 will shake your faith in the great institution of American justice. If you want to maintain your fragile illusions, do not read this book."
4,Behind the scenes justice in Chicago,"I lived for several years in southside Chicago, so I thought a book about the criminal justice system would just be fascinating. And it was. For a while. After about half the book, it was so depressing I could not go on. The miscarriages of justice, the pure volume of criminals, juries being juries and the overall sorry state of affairs in southside Chicago was just too much. I thought the writing was sharp and interesting, but it was like watching 20 straight episodes of Law and Order, but there is never a happy ending (ok, there were a couple okay endings, but not enough to revive me).I think this is a must read for anyone considering either a career in criminal justice or being a criminal (though my advice to criminals is not likely to reach its audience). It's a very interesting read for everyone, but be forewarned: it is pretty depressing."
1,Harp and heartbeat CD,"I was so excited to order this CD for my husband who has a heart condition called Atrial Fibulation. I thought by listening to a normal heart beat with the beautiful relaxation of harp music he might receive healing benefits. Unfortunately, when we listened to the CD, it was extremely difficult to hear any heartbeat. I don't know why because I had heard the same CD before and what attracted me was the sound of a strong beating heart rhythm. The harp music is relaxing and beautiful though. My husband plays this CD at his Chiropractic office for his patients. Perhaps there is another CD that has an auditory heartbeat recording."
5,AWESOME LICKS!,Very nice guitar work.. Frank has his chops down..... nice phrasing and over all body!
1,Ne sense,"This book does not make sense. There is no written translation on how to pronounce the words in English. The words are in english first and then how they are written in arabic.Thats it. Some of the print is bad too, it looks like a bad photo copy on some of the pages."
1,Sucker bait!,"I ordered this book as a gift for an army reservist who has been called up and ordered to Iraq. Maybe he could learn a few words and phrases that just might be invaluable. (When travelling to any foreign country, a little language is like a little money; much better than none at all.)The content of the book is divided into three columns on each page. The first column has a military acronym such as PX. The second column translates the aconym into English words, Post Exchange. The third column translates the English words into Arabic, which I cannot understand nor reproduce here.In someone spoke English and Arabic and was mystified by American military acronyms, this book could possibly be useful.On the other hand, if someone (who speaks no Arabic) is looking for an English-Arabic word and phrase book that could be studied to pick up a few Arabic words and phrases because they are going to be deployed, this book is 100% and totally useless. Ronald W. Bruton, Retired school administrator."
5,RJ-11 terminations work very well,"This was my first time to use these terminations. They were easy to use, using a 110 tool to punch the cat 3 wire AWG 24 wires into the termination. They are clearly color-coded,making it almost impossible to make a mistake. I installed quite a few. They worked perfectly every time. I combined these in the same outlet plate with ethernet and TV F connector terminations."
4,Worth a Read,This is the first Alexander Fullerton book I have read and its not bad. Its a little light on action and detail and heavy on relations ships for me and in a couple of instances when it just started getting interesting he skipped to the future without completing the scene. Overall though if you like WW2 naval fiction its definitely worth a read. It has made me interested in reading more of the series.
1,You don't need this one.,"I expected more, and better, from the ASPCA. This book is so basic, much too elementary for anyone who already owns a cat. Really. In two years I've learned more from my cats than this book could tell me. The information level is cursory, and in some cases, spotty. It was published in 1992, so there's NOTHING here about breakthrough medications for flea and heartworm prophylaxis. The only good thing to say about this book is that the photographs are beautiful. Wish I could send it back and buy something more informative."
4,Adorable baby gift,"I LOVED IT!! This is an adorable bracelet. Perfect for a baby baptism gift, especially from a god parent, or very close friend. If I needed I would order it again"
4,DOGS LOVE THESE!,"My six dogs love these treats above all others. These treats are perfect for training exercises. The Salmon oil provides Omega Fatties for gorgeous coats. Although the do smell fishy (Salmon oil), it isn't as bad as similar products. I would like them available in a bigger bag. If you want a healthy treat you dogs will love, try these. You dog will love you for it!"
2,"1/2 treats, 1/2 powder!","I purchased these treats because I had been satisfied with theAlaskan Bear Treats Wild-Alaskan Salmon Dog-Treat Nuggets with Blueberries, 8-Ounce Bag. Unfortunately, these are terrible. I received the package and it was half powder, half treats! Plus, it has a horrible fishy smell. I would not reccommend these treats."
4,good product,We are enjoying this cookware set a lot. It heats and cooks evenly and cleans easily. We look forward to adding to this set.
2,,kitchenAid 5 ply was not what I expected. Plus its all made in china.....GET THE ALL CLAD and spend the extra 100 on the 9 piece set.
5,Text book,"This is the second time I have purchased a textbook for my son who is at university. Even with the shipping costs, the text is generally quite a bit cheaper than what he would pay at the university.It came promptly and was new, so in excellent shape.He still has 2 years of study left before he gets his degree, so we will be using Amazon to look for any other texts books he may need.We have reccomended Amazon to all his friends.Thank you,F. McQuigginWinnipeg, Canada"
1,hmmm...SPOILER,"It was basically ALL about the baby. How the heroine felt about how the hero will be and how he treated the baby like he did his dog, talking to the baby the same way, and about how each were unloved by their parents. There was no romance in the story. I did not feel a connection through them and the only part I did even remotely like was the end when Charlotte was talking to her brother. Even that was far fetched seeing as she is 3 and can no way articulate the way she was, it seemed she was 6 or 7 instead."
2,Wilson Jones columnar pads poor quality,"In recent years Wilson Jones pads have degraded in quality with respect to the binding of the pages; consequently, when tearing off a page the edge with the prepunched holes often rips, rendering the page useless. The binding is too tight. This is a problem with other vendors as well."
3,nichole,nichole kidman is awesome in this video. she makes this move worth watching again & again...this women has a truely bueatiful body.
2,YOUNG NUBILE NICOLE KIDMAN ....,AS A ROCK SINGER ???? WHO CARES ....HER AND TOM BURLINSON HAVE SOME CHEMISTRY ....IF YOUR A FAN SHE HAS SOME NUDE SCENES ...OTHERWISE 2 C HER AT 20 YEARZ OLD WUZ A KICK ....
3,nice,"im not sure what this band is doin. (they call themselves eager seas now....whatever). but the bands lone cd under the moniker Watashi WA showed a fresh guitar driven approach which can get sadly undermined by the lame drumming and annoying by the numbers heart on sleave lyrics. GGGarth manned the boards......which is kind of weird when you finally hear what the band sounds like. but for the most part its a 12 track package of emo/pop tunefulness. Postivety sounds like the key hear but the lyrics could of been more poetic but isntead they sound like run on sentences that never get to any point. The drumming tempo is odd and irrtating, defusing the pace to too fast where it should be notched down......but i guess all songs like this shouldnt be nesscarily ballads. but depsite uneveness its still a fresh approach in a genre that justr aint fresh anymore"
1,This item is junk,I ordered this item and it arrived broken. It is simply a set of flimsy keys mounted on a thin piece of aluminum backing. I returned it and requested a refund. I have yet to hear from the vendor. Stay away from this vendor or this item in particular.
1,Ehh,I would get something like this if it had the magnetic strip to attach to the iPad. Should have spent a little morento get something like that
1,not good,"not good, it falls down easily, it is not a box and its says its is a box. Ithought it had the front and the back and the ipad will be safe in the box and its only a back part."
2,Very cheap product,"I bought this product because of its reviews. It was easy to use and connect to iPad-2. It's been designed as a very good cover as well. However removing the cover is not very easy, and the keyboard came off from its aluminum base at the second day. the sticker between the keyboard and cover is very cheap.I would not recommend this."
5,Sleek Case/Keyboard,"This Keyboard case is very nice looking and it fits the iPad like it was a native accessory. The Bluetooth is really easy to setup. I think the keys will take some time getting used to if you are accustomed to a regulation sized keyboard, but that was expected. Overall, great keyboard."
4,Hard to write with,This is an awesome keyboard looks like a Mac book air when using but not suggested for typing essays but otherwise good product!
5,AWESOME!!,"THIS CD IS AWESOME! for anyone who might like the Moffatts, Hanson, Johnny Lang etc this is an awesome cd. Gil is now 19 and is a singer big over in Germany. he plays guitars and has been recently writing new music and preparing for a new album. It shows that Gil has definitely grown up from his first album HERE I AM. Instead of a lot of pop related issues, Gil's music gets down to reality. OUT OF MY BED(STILL IN MY HEAD) is well as it sounds a song about a guy who has left a girl but wants her back. Gil redoes ITS YOUR LOVE and gives an awesome performance with that song. My favorite on the album would have to be number 13 ""SOMETIMES I"".. itz a really great song.. check out this part ""sometimes i don't know myself and i feel surprised about the things that i did to keep you until i realized that you were never there for me when i needed you the most.."" i hope that Gil begins to get known here in the US and you can help out by getting this album."
1,one of the worst books ever written about the Kennedys,"This book should never have been written. It is poorly researched, riddled with inaccuracies, and so relentlessly anti-Kennedy that it induces mental nausea. Ms. Gibson has made capital out of her secretarial job, but neither her pontificating nor the scuttlebutt of ""household staff"" is worth reading."
1,A Waste of Money!,"While I don't have an overwhelming delight nor animosity towards the Kennedy family, I believe that the author, Barbara Gibson, does. Writing this book provides her with an opportunity to bash a former employer. The book is poorly written with regurgitated passages throughout. It also contains typos that should have been easily caught during proofing. Example: Anthony Shriver ""was born in 1965..."" Further down on the same page you will find this sentence: ""In February 1965, he was quoted in People magazine..."" Please! If you are going to take my money at least get your product correct.Bottom line - Don't waste your money or your time on this book."
1,A REHASH OF THE OLDER KENNEDYS WITH LITTLE ABOUT THE YOUNGER,"This book is just a rehash of Joe,Rose,Jack and Ted. In the back of the book is a few short paragraphs about the various younger Kennedys. This book is not worth the purchase price unless you have never read a book about John Kennedy before. The information is as old as the assasination of John Kennedy and there is so little about the younger generation that you will find absolutely nothing new in here. This is just an attempt to cash in on John Jr.'s death. At the very end of the bood is a very short summary of the fact that he crashed his plane. No new information there."
5,New Fresh Bossa,"THIS CD IS SPECTACULAR! IT HAS A WONDERFUL BLEND OF NEW BOSSA MIXES AS WELL AS SOME WONDERFUL OLD COMPOSITIONS. DEFINITELY WORTH BUYING, AND THE WHOLE CD IS MUSCIALLY REFRESHING. IF YOUR INTO BRAZILLIAN MUSIC, THIS IS A MUST HAVE. TRACKS 2,3, 7 ARE THE BEST.... BE PREPARED TO PUT YOUR CD PLAYER ON REPEAT..."
2,Where was the editor?,"There's a good idea or two in here. You won't haveany problem at all finding out which one - thereare only two in the book. These are:1. Health care will become more of aconsumerist industry2. Focused factories are excellent vehiclesfor delivering careThese are pretty damn sensible ideas.Policy wonks, though, already know this. Andothers, frankly, should not read this book, sinceit is (somewhat) careless in its factualdelineation of how the HC market operates.If you can, track down some of RH's shorter papers.They're pretty durn good."
2,Aged reading but still has relevance for the Healtcare industry,"Recommended reading for any healthcare professional or related work however like any book written on a topic relating to a point in time, things change and some of that has for the subject matter in this book. Well written and informative.."
5,Buy this grill,"It's big, it's sturdy, it's got a solid and large heating element, and it's easy to clean. I've looked at all the electric grills out there and this is the only one that measures up. Best thing is the price. Excellent value"
5,Yet Another Amazing Piece of Work from The Finger,"If you thought that The Finger's first cd blew your mind (and blow mine, it did) you have to check out Rama Lama Fa Fa Fa. If it doesn't get you off your butt and make you either want to dance, or go out and break some laws, I don't know what will!"
5,Satirical Weapons of Mass Destruction,"THE BOROWITZ REPORT is perfect for anyone looking for a good, hearty bellylaugh (as the other reviewers point out) but I think it's a lot more than that. After reading this book (and then buying four more copies for friends), I asked myself what separates Andy Borowitz's comedy from so many other purveyors of ""satire"" on the scene today. I think it's this -- Borowitz blows away his targets in a way that is never mean but always hilarious. He completely avoids the kind of partisan attacks that simply preach to the converted and instead reaches for the deeper truth. And he never tells us what we already know and have heard too many times. Somehow he manages to do this while making us scream with laughter. Amazing.I can't single out one column in this book that is my favorite, but it might be this one: CHENEY'S BRIEF APPEARANCE, RETURN TO SECURE LOCATION MAY MEAN SIX MORE WEEKS OF WINTER. That is worth the entire $9.95 and then some."
2,The Borowitz Report: THe big book of Shockers,This book is WAAAAAY outdated...It might have been funny 10 years ago...but right nowit's all old news. I am looking forward to Andy's new book...I think it'll be a good one.He's a very funny man.
2,Two different books,"Because I am the first reviewer, I will tell you about the plot of the book.In this book are two different stories:1) Elizabeth and Steve had a plane accident and they were the only survivors, she was perfect after the accident and he has a broken leg, after two days some people who lived in the jungle in Australia rescue them and adopt them so they live with them.2) In England the husband of Elizabeth works in a medical laboratory and there is a virus who is killing everybody and nobody can do anything to stop the virus, that virus started in Australia.The big problem of the book is that the stories are never connected, the part of Elizabeth is another story and it could be written in another book."
4,"very good sound, *very* slim","These are designed for low-profile OEM replacement applications (1.25"" mount depth) and they're great for that. I was able to squeeze them underneath the rear headliner of a Mercedes 300TD wagon with no modifications to the car save for upgrading the mounting holes in the car's speaker bracket, but that is to be expected.The sound quality upgrade from the OE speakers is exceptional. Quite detailed for a 2-way although they do lack a bit on the low end - hard to fault them for that as the magnet is necessarily small. There are better sounding 4"" speakers out there but not in this shallow form factor and, again, excellent price point.If you don't have much vertical room to work with, you should look at these"
1,Junk being shipped as the better item,"This is the item being shipped out instead of the better, higher quality item you see when searching for this costume. This has no black cloth under the arms (on the sides) and has no badge or pips. It is just junk. The problem is, you can't tell what you're getting because someone at Amazon seems to not know the difference."
2,UGH!,"I bought this as a gift for a star trek fan, and I couldnt have been more dissapointed. The only thing in the package (which was really wrinkled and yellowed with age) was the shirt- there were no rank insignias or anything of the sort. Just an empty packet that said it contained the badges.DON'T BUY FROM THIS SELLER IT'S A SHODDY PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!"
5,WHAT A STEAL !,"I've never been able to afford very expensive pots and pans, but this one was a steal, so I HAD to buy it! It is absolutely beautiful- hefty weight, handle is very nicely secured, and the fact that it can be put in the oven is an added bonus. I look forward to many happy years of cooking using this pan!"
1,Overpay for an Item,Advertised price of 9.99 came up 28.88. This is for a 10 inch saute pan. I went ahead and paid the 28.88 because my wife wanted it but I feel that you did not do me right. What happened to the 9.99 price?M. James
4,dio dio,if you love dio and hammerfall this cd is for you alot of the songs have the same sound as dio killing the dragon cd
1,&#65533;STRAIGHT TO THE TOILET,Was surfing and came upon this trash. That this bunch of no talent losers call themselves a band is laughable! The lead singer seems to be tone deaf as he whines and hiccups through the tracks. Lyrics are a boring barrage of obscenities that don't really say anything. Sad state of affairs.
1,I can't believe this ...,"KAKA. I agree with the previous review. The singing is whiny and there is no melody. The lead singer has a terrible voice - like nails on a blackboard. I don't know what image this band is trying to convey but they are so clued out! Like a bunch of nerds yelling and swearing and trying to be cool.This doesn't sound like Alex Harvey at all but like a bunch of 10 year olds. The one who wrote that rosebud or something must be deaf. Or maybe it was the band themselves that wrote that review hoping to promote the album. In any case, it's complete garbage and don't waste your money. I wouldn't even take it if I got it for free that's how bad it is."
5,Cuba as she really is!,"This is a superb book! The photos are excellent, showing Cuba as it truly is today, with whatever still stands after four decades of inattention. Anyone who has not seen Cuba in 40 years should pereuse this book. The photographer does not make a political statement of any sort -- he merely records the beauty that is there. One of the few books about Cuba that I would recommend to anyone, regardless of political sympathies."
1,Awful,"It was cheap and you certainly get what you paid for. I falls apart, and does not tolerate any hard use. In short: do not bother. It is a piece of junk"
3,good for fries but doesn't cut the last layer due to the holder,"good for fries but doesn't cut the last layer due to the safety holder. inexpensive so i don't expect much from it, but I'm glad i got it. Alton Brown did a show on mandolins...this one's your inexpensive non-professional one, only 2 thicknesses, whereas the professional 35 dollar ones have adjustable thicknesses you can control like a machine deli cutter; though i don't know if it can make french fry cuts like this one does cuz of the extra blade. width is decent to fit potatoes. the other attachment can probably dice onions nicely for salsa pico de gallo.oh and the main attachment's a straight cut; 2 thicknesses by reversing the blade."
5,best spf ever.,"The only spf that ever kept the promise written on the bottle. Will work even after a long swim. Put it on in the morning, be out in the mexican sun all day and u will not turn red. My skin type on top of that is fairly light...Expensive? Yeah, but lasts long and i economical in usage.None better."
4,Tremendous Creativity,"I don't typically read fantasy as they all seem to be cut from the same mold; however Witch Ember caught my curiosity. It was recommended by a fantasy fan who said it was different. Well, he was right.I thoroughly enjoyed the story. Dark and creative. The languages and games that John creates are well thought out. The characters really come alive as you start to feel yourself following the main character through her travels.If you want something different. Something a bit out of the norm, this book is for you. If you like the cookie-cutter reads, then this one is for you as well. It'll let you see that there is another side to writing."
5,Awesome CD!,"I can't believe those people who hated this CD!! You people must be asleep! Maybe it's just cuz I'm a Pokemon Fanatic, but I LOVE this CD!!! Well, thats my opinion. And all you people who say this CD sucks: WAKE UP!!"
2,Not-so-thrilled,"This soundtrack isn't the greatest. Like most other reviewers say, rap, rock, and unimaginable, awkward sounds and noises mix together making this cd an inch away from being a complete mess. Probably, the only tracks that are satisfactory is the main theme, the pokerap and what kind of pokemon are you. That's about it. From a scale 1 through 10, I have to say that this soundtrack would definetely mark the open #TWO space, meaning one point away from disaster. Thanks for your effort, producers, but we'd rather stick to some normal soundtracks. Better luck next time."
5,I love all the songs!!!! They just are so totally pokemon!!!,My favorite song is Pikachu's Goobye it is so sad. i read the summary of that episode while I was listening to it and i cried 'cause it was so sad!!!! i defenetly reccomend this cd to any Pokemon fan!!!!!!
2,I listened to it for 4 hours and it got BORING,"It was cool for 2 hours then after hearing ""gotta catch them all"" 236 times in 1 day i got bored and threw away the CD. So I don't recomend it. But, my friend LOVES it, so it just depends on how much you like pokemon. (He would rate it 1,000,000,000,000,000 and beyond if they would let him!"
2,Sort Of,"I'm a big fan of Poke'mon and all , but it seems like this CD has nothing to do with Poke'mon except that it mentions the name on the CD.It seems as if it is a mix of different songs , but with the word ""Poke'mon"" thrown in here and there. The world of Poke'mon is capable of producing much more than this trash."
2,"It's not a TOTAL waste of money, but.......................","I like how they added lyrics to the opening, and I really like Misty's song, just wish they would have got a better singer to sing it. The rest of the songs ranged from ""ok"" to ""what the heck is this?!?!"" The japanese sound track is like 100X better, even though it is sung in japanese. I hope the Mewtwo strikes back soundtrack is better."
5,I can't wait to get the cd.,"I can't wait to get the cd! I always listen to the samples everyday! I ordered the cd but I wonder how many days I have to wait! I just love this cd, so I just can't wait to get it someday real soon! I wish i could hear it all now! Sincerely, Brian Lee"
5,What Kind Of Pokemon Are You?,THAT SONG IS SO GOOD!!!!!!!! ARE YOU A NORMAL TYPE LIKE JIGGLYPUFF!? BUT THE GHOSTLY GENGAR BATTLE REAL TOUGH!
5,good,this is a good cd and when it comes out to stores i am going to get it . you should get it cool
5,cool it has new songs that i have never heard of.,I think that this c.d. is going to be the best ever.I love pokemon songs and now i can listen to them when i want to.
4,Pretty darn good,"It's pretty good, Misty's Song just tells how she likes Ash, and the other songs aren't too bad either. I dislike the song Viridian City for some reason, dunno why."
2,"Not worth the listen, let alone the purchase.","I haven't actually purchased this CD, but I've listened to the sample songs (about 5) and they aren't very good. Listen and decide for yourself if this is worth the money, but don't jump in blindly (or deafly?) or you might just get burned."
5,I think this CD rocks,I just want to ask that if I buy the CD how do I pay you? My Email address is KHau584@aol.com
3,If pokemon were alive i would be the best!,Frist you shoud be nice to the Pokemon.Traning is inportin because they will die Because you will not know what to do about it. But if they were alive then you should find help.If you had a Chanse then you should know that it doesn't evolve.I think you shoud now some facts about pokemon .
2,WHAT?,"Ok... I buy the CD. I listen to it. A lot of the songs sound corny (especially the pikachu's goodbye whatchamadoongit and what kind of pokemon are you) EXCEPT for Misty's Song (but the name makes me laugh :) and Double Trouble. I like the Pokemon games, and a certain few episodes of the TV show. I bought this because of some good reviews, and it said ""Songs from the hit TV Show"". And this is gonna be on Pikachu's Jukebox? ENUFF PIKA! KADABRA RULEZ!"
3,Not too bad....,"2 B A Master isn't too bad. Although I wish they included a full length version of the Team Rocket song (form the Jigglypuff episode). 2BA Master is an OK song. The Pokerap and theme song is good, too. My two faves though are Misty's Song and Double Trouble. Another thing that bothered me: Is it just my imagination or did the song Together Forever (one song on the CD I didn't enjoy too much) sound a lot like a Backstreet Boy was singing it?"
5,AN amazing album for an amazing show.,THe album combines the tye of chart topping music with the real fun spirit of the TV show and the game.
2,"One good song, but that's about it.","Seriously, ""Misty's Song"" is SO cheesy, ""Everything Changes"" is boring, ""What Kind of Pokemon Are You"" and ""Viridian City"" have no relevance to life, and ""Together Forever"" and ""My Best Friends"" are cheap rip-offs of boy bands *shudder*! Other songs like ""Double Trouble"" and the Pokemon Dance Mix are all right, but not spectacular. You're probably asking right now ""Then what is this good song you were talking about?"" The answer: ""The Time Has Come"". I'm just about to graduate high school, so I know what it's like to have to say goodbye to a best friend. I can relate to this song, and that's why I like it. But even so, the TV show version is SO much better (better voice, sadder tune, etc.).Overall, this CD is only for DIEHARD Pokemon fans."
2,great cd,"song 8 is the only good song on here! its a japanese techno mix and since i love tecno, it is clearly the best."
1,This CD is a terrible pop collaboration!,"This cd is an absolute horrible collection of bubble gum pop crap. This cd has been created for the sole purpose of making money, no heart or fun has been put into this whatsoever. Being a fan of Pokemon, I expected an enjoyable cd, but alas I was treated to this unoriginal n sync-like garbage."
1,The Trouble you are Causing,"Hello this is the Government of Fads. We are sorry to report that you at Pokemon are causing much trouble. It seems that you have created something much harder for the world. Little kids are your victims. Do you have mercy?! Children do not need this in their young age. It seems that children have become ""Pokefanatics"". We at the Government of Fads do not approve of this behavior. Children have become ripoffs and con artists. Suppose a young child is giving away a fifty cent card for an fifty dollar card. Now when the child finds out about this, he will break into tears. Doesn't that make you sad. Childern have to focus on their work in school, not Pikachu. We have seen many fads in this decade alone, but nothing like this. You cause uproars in schools. You try to make this world better, but all you do is make it worse. With every step you take, including making the CD, you do something, but it is not good.Govenment of Fads"
3,Son is big pokemon fan,He loves the opening song to Pokemon - I ordered CD for him to listen to songs. He said that he did not know all the songs that were on the CD. We have only listened once to every song and he has not requested to hear it again.
1,"Shut up,Government of fads!","Pokemon is really,great and there is no such thing as the government of fads anyway. They are too making the world better,and being caught up in a fantasy world with magical powers from the lush grass in the shade of mt moon(that was from Song of Jigglypuff)is better than living in reality where everyone has to be mean to eachother. Most Pokemaniacs(not Pokefanitics,you got our title wong)are immune to teasing from other kids because they can always quote characters to defend themselves and it always makes them feel better. You don't know how good it is to be a Pokemaniac. Pokemaniacs wouldn't be Pokemaniacs if it was really as bad as you said."
3,Well..... It was rather cute.,"this cd was amusing. The beats to the songs were nice, but that 'Misty's Song', UGGGGG! That song screamed out Tacky!"
2,Yuck,"So far, from what I've heard, this album is not good. The only things going for it are the American versions of the Pokérap, the American Theme Song and the Team Rocket Song."
4,Funky beats suitable for all ages,The Pokemon 2.B.A Master disc will keep you goin' for a while but it could use a tad more rockish feeling than R&B and Pop.
5,This CD ROCKS!!!,"This CD rocks!! ""Double Trouuble"" isn't the Team Rocket poem you hear on the show everyday! I Cried during ""The Time Has Come"" When I Heared ""Misty's Song"" I couldn't beleve her secret!! A must have!!!!!!"
5,A Great CD,This is a one of a kind C.D. Move over Backstreet Boys Pikachu is coming to town. This C.D. is sensational a must have! I have only heard demos from all accross the net and It's great. I love pokemon! Theis C.D. is definitly a must have!
4,great,its great to dance to. i must say i like misty's song the most...most of the tracks are dance songs. Although not all of them (mistys song). it is great for young children even if you don't watch pokemon!
5,This Kicks!,"Being a fan of Pokemon, I bought this CD.It didn't look that good but the songs were awesome! I'm a HUGE fan of Team Rocket(Rocket Troop/Rocket Dan) and I was really glad to see they had their own song!There's some songs I've never heard on the show, and I would recommend this to anyone!"
4,Pritty Cool,I'm kinda a Pokemaniac myself. I have almost all the stuff.(except the dolls)The only annoying part of the show however is when Jessie and James do their Team Rocket poem. (I mute it every time they do that)
5,This CD is one of the best I've ever heard!,This CD has a lot of excellent songs and would make an excellent present for any pokemon fan.
5,Can you save me one?,Hi. I am Robert. I'm a poke'manic.As in a boy/girl thats crazy aboout Poke'mon.I would like this cd. I don't have the money right now.But I'll have it in 3 weeks. Can you save me one? Robert.
5,"This CD totally rocks arse it is the musical revolution,man","Now, this CD really smackasses the opposing rappers of the world including my man COOLIO and my sistas TLC This Cd is the revolution of the music/rap/disco/techno/dance industry I love my Level 67 Lapras because it can beat my friend bob's level 22 charmander when I use hydro-pump."
3,Pretty good. i'm impressed!,"I'm glad that the pokemon theme was lengthened and spiffed up like the japanese opening is on my cd. from what i've listened to, the other tracks are not bad but a bit big-deal ish. I first heard ""double trouble""as a lengthened version in japanese called ""team rocket forever"" and it has been by favorite ever since. I'm sad to hear they didn't lengthen it. I also wish that they put a japanese track or two on it, like on sailormoon's lunarock cd. of course it would also be cool to hear ash, misty, and brock's actual voice actors singing (especially if it was the american or japanese pokemon theme-in english of course!)^^o^^breeeee!!"
1,Dear lord save me from a cheap dubbed rip-off CD...,"Ok, ok. I love Pokemon as much as anyone, and probably more. But, I am a purist, meaning I want anything translated to be as close to the original as humanly possible, which is not done at all in this case! I own an import Pokemon CD and I musst say it is 100x better than anything in the dub. The theme song is so much more energetic and lively, and the Rocket Gang song, although it has the same tune in the dub, the meaning is much much different. I say, if you want a Pocket Monsters CD, save up more and buy an original. You'll be glad."
1,this cd sucks,"I'm a pokefan, as much as the next guy, but pokemon has no chance at the music industry."
2,Where's Andrea Bocelli at?,"Silly little piece. This CD came with the music video for the PokéRAP. That is one of the only fun things about this, aimed at fans of the TV series. ""The Time Has Come"" and the Pokémon theme are exceptional, but little more. As for the others....the end. Also, Andrea Bocelli REALLY needs another part in a soundtrack. Where IS he when you need him?"
3,"fine,but i prefer the original japanesse sound trak",it is ok. The musics are the same that we listen every day on TV. but however ... i like much better tthe original music from the japanesses. not to mention the battle music. psyduck pysduck psy ai ai ai
5,AWESOME!,"Hey! I just bought this C.D. thinking it was downright ok. But, it wasn't! It has just great pop songs! I wish they would make more CDs like this! It's just AWESOME!"
5,I Love It,"I just got this CD today, and I've already listened to the entire thing at least 5 times, maybe even more. My favorite song is ""Double Trouble"" because it has a great beat and excellent lyrics. I think everyone should buy this CD. I think both kids and parents will love it alike."
4,Gotta Tap Your Toes and Groove on Down the Road!!,This CD is really upbeat with a few slower numbers thrown infor balance. The Dance Mix with Vicki Sue Robinson was great. Sowhat if all the stuff wasn't in the show? It's always nice to have a little more POKEMON!! Gotta catch 'em all and this one is a keeper!
3,Pokemon 2 B A Master CD,The songs are good but there deffently not good as the Japinse ones! Im mean if you gave this CD to a japinse kid he will not like it because some of the songs don't even seem to do with Pokemon! On the other hand a Japinse Pokemon CD has at least 1 Pokemon word and in it and seems like no rap or disco just good music like there original theme song! If you are a Poke freak it will be O.K. with you but if you like Pokemon a little do not get it!
1,Do not even make eye-contact,This CD reeks! Stay away from this at all cost unless you are a crazed fanatic of Pokemon (not likely after you hear this).
3,"So far its ""ok""",im a major pokemon fan but this just uummm...how do i say it....isnt pokemonish.i mean who wrote the lyrics...a 3 year old.what kind of pokemon are u?that song is worse than some of wierd al's songs.i mean u can bearly tell what there saying in that song and when u figure out what he's saying its like what the bloody heck.well ive only heard 4 snips of songs.{and they arent great}any ways if anyone could tell me where to hear the others i would be greatful.thanx
5,I really liked the music I heard,I have always liked the music that you play on the show. It will be great to be able to listen to the music anytime. I am looking forward to hearing the whole thing.
5,I Really Like this CD,"I love the CD, But does anyone like Mistys Song? Am I the only one? One reson why is because I watch the tv show, and didnt understand why Misty likes Ash, but then I new Ash liked her"
5,coooooool!!!!!!!,"This is the coolest cd ever!!! Even before i bought it the bits on Pikachus jukebox made me go wild. A must for every Pokemon fan. With excellent songs like Viridian city to the funny team rocket, to the very emotional Time has come, well it made me cry anyway, it may leave you thinking, what kind of Pokemon are you? Live it, love it, get it."
3,"I like the first & last songs, but the rest aren't that good",2.B.A. Master is okay but I would spend my money on other things
5,Nice Music!,"Although I've also heard the Japanese songs, I like the American version too. I was affraid this CD would be like Sailor Moon's first one. I would really like to hear the samples for ""Misty's song"" and ""Time has come"". I live in Mexico, so I think we have no hopes for having a CD based on the series (here TV broadcasters just spend money in soccer and soap operas, argh!) We have the USA version for the openning and the Pokerap (of course in Spanish) I had the oportunity of watching the Japanese OP and liked it too even when they are quite different since they are both pop music. For the samples in here I really like the music. Let's hope it arrives here, even as an import product:) (It will cost about $200 pesos, around $20 dollars!)"
4,Good Series,"I really enjoyed watching this series some years ago on Cartoon Network. For the price it's really hard to beat, cost about as much to buy it here as it would've to rent all six discs from Hastings.There series itself is good, I'd recommend it to anyone over the age of probably 14 or 15. There's some interesting things that go on in the story that I think would take a certain level of maturity to understand. But if anything else the main character sets stuff on fire!"
3,"Too much filler, too little content!","This is a magic girl series. As such, it does not translate well to male viewers under the best of conditions. From a male point of view - one who loved Rahxephon, Escaflowne and The Last Exile - the plot is agonizingly slow, astonishingly simple, and mostly devoid of intensity.While there are a handful of very entertaining moments in the series, it is largely dull. Too many times in this series nothing is actually going on in scene after scene. If you get bored doing nothing, why watch anime about people doing nothing? This series defiantly should have been 13 episodes but was stretched out to 24 for some reason. As such, expect 11 episodes of filler in an otherwise solid and fun anime.10/30/06 Edit:Readers beware of review usefulness for this anime. There appears to be a fangirl group slamming the many negative reviews of this anime."
3,Monotone diologue!!,"I bought this collection at a sale for $75, so I figured that I might as well. I have a mini collection of anime and i have watched my share of them, but this, by far, has been the biggest waste of money (anime wise). I can handle crappy animation (Fist of the North Star), at least it keeps me busy until i find something better, but, crappy diologue with stupidity and monotone brakes my limit. Their supposed to be a crime fighting agency, law enforcement, and yet Robin doesnt know that shes not supposed to take evidence from a crime scene. Theres something wrong with the whole series; its hard to get attached to the characters unlike other animes and its actually easy to get anoyed by the main character (thats a first, for me at least)"
2,Neon Genesis warmed over,"More of the 'Angst ridden teens save the world' plot line.Who these witches are, why they are, why they do what they do , why we should care and why 15 year old kids are fighting them, are never explained. We just know they are bad and only high school students can stop them.Unless you just can't get enough of Evangelion give this one a pass."
4,I guest it's pretty good,The show was boring on adult swim the animation was not all that good. It's a pretty dark anime but nothing scary about it.Robin named after the king of witches must be the at least annoying heroines/heroes of the anime lot and with her supposed innocence it is hard to believe she in caught up in such devious acts.
5,WHR - The Complete Collection,"This complete collection consists of the same 6 discs from the individual volumes in a digipak and a collector's pin set. The book-like package that you see in the product image above is actually a flimsy outer housing that holds the pin set and the real digipak. This collection was released in late 2004 for a limited run, mainly to cash in the holiday season."
3,This is a fair series,"After reading the reviews here I decided to watch the series. The plot is interesting in the beginning but I found myself waiting for the story to unfold. However it did so very slowly, and when it did, it was too little too late in my opinion. In other series like Cowboy Bebop, Trigun or Samurai Champloo, many early episodes unseemingly added small parts of a greater story which would unfold later in a powerfull way. I think there is too much hunting adding very little to the story in the first part of the series. The characters are well drawn but I think their personnalities and interrelations could have been more complex. The quality of the animation is top notch and the music is good. This was an OK series but I was dissapointed. For those looking for something similar but much better, I suggest checking out Full Metal Alchemist which has a very moving story, complex characters and presents deep interesting themes."
5,Witch Hunter Robin,"Witch hunter robin contains 26 episodes. It is the story of a young fifteen year old girl who has pyrokenisis(I believe that is what it's called),The ability to create and control fire. She is a hunter used to fight and capture witches. Robin is very good at her work and her power grows. She soon is classified as a witch and the people she was working for now are hunting her. She can't trust her friends, lifes are sacrified, and dark secrets are revealed. It's a very good series. It's a little boring at first, but it get's really good and you fall in love with the characters. I recommend this to people who like mysteries, actions anime, witch craft, good dark storylines, and a small smudgen of horror and romance."
5,Awesome all around,"The series arrived in a very well packaged, undamaged condition, and there was nothing wrong with any of the discs. They played beautifully. The price was also extremely good. I would definitely buy from this seller again."
2,Dark drama that does not end well,"The biggest draw for me in anime is an engaging plotline that really makes you think in new directions. Witch Hunter Robin was recommended to me by a fellow lover of the more serious type of anime. I didn't like it; I found the plotline to be predictable and forced with a 'so-that's-it?' ending I hated.The animation is top quality with lots of dark tones and the music is appropriately spooky. Good visuals don't make up for bad story though. This serious drama geared is towards adults, and not children. If you like dramatic build-up that delivers, humor, or romantic comedy give this a pass."
4,excellante,I have thourghly enjoyed watching every episode and extremly glad I got this. It is highly recommended to anyone who like fantasy no matter your age. The end also leaves something for your own imagination.
4,It's Awsome,i Loved the book but like the second reveiwer said is does go on a bit but that easy enough to fix simple scan over it till you get to the interesting part again and continue reading but i like the plot and the characters and find it very well writen and trully wish thwe Autors would reconsider and write the third book
1,I loved this series - but IT WILL NOT BE COMPLETED!,"I wrote Baen Books and this is what they said: ""Due to various unsolvable problems, the third Arcana novel will not be published. Baen Books"" I think that it is outrageous that they will not complete this series. How disappointing."
4,Great speaker for the price.,"Speakers fit right in the original covers, I had to make no additional alterations, and they sound great. For the money they were a great deal."
3,hollow sound,I bought 4 of these to replace the oem speakers in my truck. The sound quality is poor. If I turn the radio up halfway the bass begins to distort and the vocals sound like a tin can. With the radio on normal volume the bass sounds hollow. If I had to do it again I would spend more money and get better speakers. This may work best for someone who doesn't care about sound clarity or just sound in general and is just looking to replace their broken oem speakers.
3,ok set of speakers,great price. ok speakers. kind of what i expected from a set of pyles. but i have sounds now to drown out my little high revver.
2,I Love KitchenAid But....,"I love KitchenAid, but this grill pan was not for me. It would not sit evenly on my ceramic cook-top out of the box. The handle appears too heavy on the end. It would not be much of a problem on a gas range, but a real disappointment for me. This led to uneven cooking and some burning in the pan. And with the grooves, this pan is exceptionally tough to clean relative to the flat five-ply 12 inch skillet. Even if the grill pan sat evenly on my range, the cleaning of the pan was certainly a major drawback to using this pan."
4,Excellent grill pan!!!,"I ordered this grill pan from Amazon b/c I was sick of usingthe George Foreman grill. I just don't like any of the electric plug in grills because they're much harder to clean and you can't just immerse the entire thing in water or put it in the dishwater. I wanted a grill pan made out of a high grade of durable stainless steel. This is made of a high grade stainless steel because its 5 ply construction. I ordered it in 2006 and it works for cooking just about anything! I use it to grill chicken, hot dogs, hamburgers, etc. I like that this pan isgenerally very easy to clean, like most stainless steel cookware, but for some reason my handle has gotten rustic so do control the amount of heat you use. Medium or low heat is fine with this pan!"
1,"Deserves zero stars, but rating system not that low.","Worst book I've ever read. Pendelton must be slowing down or going senile. Bolan only killed two goons in a rambling heap of trash of 346 pages. Maybe he didn't write it at all. I believe some counterfeit person tried his hand at writing like Pendleton, but couldn't stick to the formula. Gold Eagle must have not done a good review or they are just money grubbers, not caring what kind of junk ideas they publish."
4,Acer aspire one carry all,"This backpack is great, there of good quality and plenty of padding for those bumps in life. the pocket could be positioned better and could be sized better. other than that great pack for your small note book computer."
1,This bag lies on the specs...,"Would have been perfect, but did not fit! The specs say that it will fit a 14.1"" laptop. My Dell D630, one of the most popular 14.1"" business laptops, would not fit at all. Don't be fooled. I had to go to the Mobile Edge 15.4"" messenger bag. That one is perfect... and it even fits the 15.4"" laptops as well as the 14.1. At least that one has an accurate description."
2,"Less ""messenger"", more ""satchel""","This was a well thought out bag with well placed pockets, good size storage for laptop and documents, but this is where the praise ends. When they chose a strap for this bag, I think they simply grabbed any old length of webbing and called it good, not even a seconds thought. It's not long enough for even the shortest person to wear as a ""messenger"", perhaps as a ""satchel"". When trying to carry the bag in ""messenger mode"", the strap quickly cuts into the side of your neck (I believe someone else also left a similar comment about the strap), but this is really extreme. I can't recommend this bag to anyone who's not interested is cutting off the strap and carrying it around by the handle all the time. I hope this helps someone make an informed decision."
4,"Nice bag, but with some shortcomings","I'll try to be very short and to the point:Good - form factor, quality materials.Bad - absence of handle (only shoulder strap)"
1,Does not fit a 13.3 Inch Ultrabook,I gave this item 1 star because it states that 13.3 inch ultrabook. The bag is well made but when I put in my Asus 13.3 inch Ultrabook more than 2 inches of it was sticking out of the top and completely unprotected. This bag would work very well for an iPad or tablet but not much more.
3,My tablet fits in it,bought it to use to carry my Galaxy note 10.1 tablet and also carry my Logitech k810 bluetooth keyboard. Tablet fits nicely in the padded compartment even with a semi bulky case on it. Plenty of pockets for cables and other small thingsThe drink compartment on the side is only big enough for a standard size of bottled water. The cell phone pocket barely fits my Samsung galaxy s3 with an otterbox commuter case on it. Mp3 player pouch has a hole so your headphone wire can come out. I wish the Mp3 player case was more padded.
4,Good small notebook bag,"Small and efficient. Don't like the flap over the outside pockets--prefer a simple zipper. Amazing how going small (Sony 13.1"" Z series notebook) helps travel."
4,Too bad the hood isn't quite as functional...,"I would give it five stars except that the hood isn't as functional as I'd like - it barely pulled up past the head, making it almost pointless to have a hood. The clear part, I'm assuming if it did fit over the head, is for being able to see, and a great idea, but again, did not fit my dog's head."
2,If you like Southern Rock you will like My Morning Jacket,"Warning: This album will put you in the Christmas spirit...it might even inspire you to bake gingerbread cookies for your neighbor or something. Most of this album is pretty cheesy and it made me laugh, but maybe that's just because I am not a fan of country-influenced tunes, exactly what this album IS--Most songs are quite ""twangy."" My Morning Jacket reminds me of Neil Young but they have some harmonies like the Beach Boys. Track one, ""Xmas Curtain,"" was my favorite, and it was definitely the most ""Beach Boys-ish."" Track four is a cover of Nick Cave's ""New Morning,"" and Track five is a cover of Elvis Presley's ""Santa Claus is Back in Town."" The Elvis cover is really funny, it made me laugh, and it's heavily blues-influenced. I do have to say that judging from the cd cover, these boys look like a riot to hang out with!"
2,Don't bother,I bought this product hoping to see some change maybe not right away but after a week or so..I saw nothing it is a good moisturizer that's about it.
3,RevitaLift,I order L'Oreal RevitaLift I am 59 My skin isn't to bad with wrinkles some brown spots. I really didn't see to much of a change. It smells nice and is like most other produts. The price was good.
2,"Adequate, but not quite up to the advertising hype","Very nice as a moisturizer, but does nothing to improve the look of skin, wrinkles, or circles beyond what I would expect from any regular moisturizer. Would be four or five stars as a plain moisturizer, but I gave it two because it is advertised as more than that and fails to deliver."
3,its ok,read the reviews and thought i would try this but i did not see great results in 3 weeks of using so i went back to old faithful. may work for someone else just not me
3,I don't look any younger,"It is a nice lotion, but that is it. So you are paying a high price for just plain old lotion. I must admit, however, that I am not real good about using this as a regular regimen. I tried to in the beginning, but should have known myself better. I still don't think it would have done the miracles I wanted. If it was what I was hoping, everyone would have been screaming from the roof tops....hopefully I remember this for next time. :)"
5,THIS IS ONE YOU REALLY NEED TO TRY,"I will be reordering Revitalift, This is by far one of the better products of this sort I have used. I really liked every thing about it,"
4,Actually firms!,"After Dr. Oz had a program about products that work for under $20, I decided to give this one a try. I've lost weight and I've got a little loose skin under the neck. This product really does the job! I've gone a day or two without it and notice the return of that wrinkled skin. After going back on this double-lifting gel I happily got back the nice results. The only problem with this is that since it's actually two products pumped, I always seem to finish one side before the other. That's the only reason why I gave it four stars instead of five."
1,dont be fooled by lift feeling- its alcohol!!!,"Revitalift Double Lifting can make skin feel tighter temporarily because of the amount of alcohol and absorbent magnesium sodium silicate it contains, but that's about drying up skin and causing irritation, which is actually wrinkle-inducing. There isn't much else to extol in this gel, and calling it advanced must be L'Oreal's idea of sarcasm."
3,"Good quality, but does not fit build a bear size.",We bought it for a build a bear. But the item is too small. It won't fit. So we have to keep looking and gave this one to a webkin.
4,Belt fits tractor and works fine,Second belt ordered for mower this year. First one from another vendor did not fit. This belt fit machine and works grate.
5,Truly a blueprint to health,"Getting back on form is not a trip to the drug store! Its rebalancing and you can do that in the produce section of your local organic fruit and veggie store....if you know how. And if you have this book its simple. Now, some of the cures are not tasty - but they WORK!!! If you're looking for something that tastes good, buy a coke and look over coffins...if you are looking for health, you found it.smile!"
5,"depending on what you are sick with, this book with offer you the right recipe","In this slim volume are very specific health formula to make you better, (some taste nice others not so nice, but if you want health you may have to drink some greens!) very, very, very good! This should be in your health chest, in case of any problems, just look up the formula! They work!"
2,The Elevator Music of DnB,"Jeez, this album isn't horrible but it's nothing to write home about. Most of the tracks on here are mediocre and, to me, don't justify being on a ""classic"" album. The included artists All have better songs from that time period. Contains the weakest Dillinja track I've ever heard. You can also hear where Roni Size almost figured out how to compose an entertaining song. If you buy this, get it cheap so you have money leftover for a coffee to keep you awake while you listen."
4,Classic Vintage Outdoor Writing,If you enjoy outdoor writing from days gone by then you will like this book. Most stories set in 1930's-1940's.
4,Pretty good,"This was a pretty good book, I think it was my first homosexual book I've read, yet alone a first S&M; book. It was scary on some parts, but hey, that may be the lifestyle. I was hooked all the way until the end on what happened to Brad. But you get so many liars in the book you don't know what really happened.. I guess that's why I give it a 4 star rating.Other than that, it's worth the read if you don't mind S&M;/gay erotica"
1,Less than one star,"This ""book"" was so bad that I couldn't talk myself into hoping for some redemptive middle or conclusion. I found it offensive, bad writing. I don't mind edgy lit, but this doesn't qualify as edgy, much less as literature. The author may have aspired to something like Burroughs' ""Naked Lunch,"" but didn't come remotely close. Never again, Mr. Cooper."
1,Warning,"This book contains extremely graphic violent scenes. Sexualized murder and sadomasochistic fantasies, rape, pedophilia, castration, etc. If you are the type of person that doesn't want to know just how horrible another person can be, do not buy this book. It will scar you. I don't think that any description can really tell you how awful this book is."
1,Don't bother to read,"This is a strange, disturbing and confusing book. The author uses a clever idea of advancing the text using emails, but the author offers no plot, no characters, and the book is not even sexually interesting."
1,"OK, I Must Have Missed Something!","As an avid reader of gay fiction I was anxious to delve into my first Dennis Cooper piece. The title attracted my attention as well as the cover art. The cover even stated that The Village Voice had selected this title as one of the top 25 books of 2004. (Shame on the Voice)! So the story began. I liked the way the author relayed the events through chat room discussions. However, as the book progressed some of the violent sex acts reported were a complete turn-off for me. If you like reading about interesting sexual encounters this book certainly has its fill, but when we start getting into castration and the killing of male escorts this is where I have to draw the line for myself. If this sort of thing gets you going I highly recommend this piece, otherwise, forget it! Needless to say I don't think I will be reading any other of Dennis Cooper's titles."
1,Do not buy,"Remotes are terrible. Not even in the ball park when compared to a Davis certified temp sensor. Bad quality control or somebody can't read a thermometer, pretty bad when its digital. I called tech support and they called back a week later. I sent it back before they called."
4,nice,nice product with a wireless sensor includedI made a mystake and ordered an other oneso it's not necessary
3,Gift returned,Purchased as a gift and it was returned as not what the person wanted.Star rating is based on the identical item I own.
1,(La Crosse Tech.WS-9013UWorks only for two days.,"Hi, When we bought it is worked fine. Then one day it stopped working so we replaced the batteries and it began to send the temperature readings to the receiver. After 2 days it stopped working. We replaced the batteries with brand new ones and it began to work for one day. Then it would occasionally work for one day or lass. It was beyond the return date When I took it from the drawer I put it in.. So I am just writing this review to warn people from buying this device. When it was working it was exactly what I needed. I will not recommend this item to anyone.J.GellerWC, CaliforniaLa Crosse Technology WS-9013U-CBP Wireless Temperature Station"
1,Stopped working after one day,I had the remote unit outside and under my garage roof overhang. It may have gotten a litle wet but it wouldnt have been much. Whats the point of putting it outside if it cant withstand the elements. I would not recommend this purchase. Put an outdoor analog type theromometer out instead. Not recommended.
2,I wish it had better packaging...,"I strictly purchased this as a gift, so this review is from the gift giver's point of view and is for buyers who might be considering this as a gift. I have no idea if it works. But, I was hoping, for the price, it would have been packaged better. It looks like I spent $5 in the clearance aisle at a home store. Hopefully, it works better than it looks in the packaging."
2,Inconsistent and Inaccurate,"The remote feature works well. Even through a couple of walls. However the units are not accurate or even consistently inaccurate. When co-located outdoors, they (very) occasionally agree within a couple of tenths of a degree. Mostly they vary by 2 or more degrees. Often they vary by up to 4.9 degrees. You can't even just figure on adding or subtracting a certain amount, or even percentage. The variations are all over the place!Customer service responded quickly, but I certainly didn't like the answer. They said that behavior is normal and to be expected, stataing ""All electronic devices have similar tolerances."" (I wonder if the health care industry is aware of that!)If you just want a generalized idea of temperature, the product is fine; if you want anything like a real reading, look elsewhere."
1,not quite,Temp registers 4-7 degres off actual temp. Usually too high.Clock consistently 5 minutes ahead of actual timeLa Crosse Technology WS-9013U Wireless Temperature Station
2,"Accurate, but LCD is NOT as bright as you see here","The accuracy and features of this were just what we wanted, but we were no prepared for how poor the LCD display was. You must mount this in a very well lit area to see it.Note to Amazon: The photo above is misleading. The LCD is NOWHERE NEAR as bright and high contrast as the product photo above. I think I'll post a customer photo that shows it a little more accurately.I'm wishing I'd have spent a little more for a nicer unit, but not dissatisfied enough to go through the return hassles."
5,Outstanding thermometer,"I put this in our office trailer for the superintendent. We record the weather and temperature every day AM and PM for legal reasons.Before he would have to open the window and tilt the thermometer to see how high up the red juice went. This is a lot easier, the receiver sits on his desk. Great product, and it works."
5,Wireless temp,"It was easy to set up and seems to be working well. I am enjoying having the outside/inside temp available at all times. Since the unit is protable, I can have it in any room that I wish. The time feature was an added bonus and at least one clock in the house is accurate. I am enjoying the wireless temp very much."
5,Incredible,I like this temperature station very much and can hardly imagine not having it. It is very convenient to know the provided einformation at a glance and you may place the sensors in different places. It is excellent for houses and so far works great. Highly recommended.
4,Temperature Station,Seems to be working fine. Only thing I would have liked is a humidity reading included.
3,you get what you pay for.. sometimes less,"I have a lot of temperature monitors because I have a passive heating system that depends of my attic heating to a certain point-- The La Crosse is a little cheaper, but does not have some of the useful functions like humidity. The remote sensor is not as straight forward as others and requires inserting batteries in remotes in sequence to link them. The biggest ""red flag"" to me is that with the base unit and the remote sitting next to each other, they don't have the same temperature-- after watching it for a week, they generally run about 2' off each other. I tried to contact La Crosse via email and phone but have received no response at all."
2,Maybe it's too cold for it in Maine,"I have yet to get it to work with the outside sensor. The one time it did work for a while, it was off the next morning. I have had another brand that worked for a number of years. I may have just gotten a dud. It happens. All of it works fine except for the outside sensor portion which is the chief reason I purchased it."
2,Outside Temp Stopped Working,"I recieved 2 temp gauges for Xmas last year. I gave this one to my neighbors I kept the other one (Oregon Scien). Mine still works great, my friends does not do outside temp anymore. We replaced the batteries, cleaned the sensors but nothing work. I guess you get what you pay for with this product."
1,Doesn't receive through walls,"Simply, this product doesn't work.The receiver doesn't receive the outside sensor signal through an outside wall. If you place the sensor within ten feet without walls, it works fine, but it does not fulfill its description.Avoid this product!"
3,"Adequate, but not great","The thermometer seems to perform as it is supposed to and although I haven't tested the extreme range of the remote sensors, they perform adequately, the outside sensor is located approximately fifty feet from the base unit and through two walls.My main complaint is that when it arrived there was a loose part inside. I installed batteries and it worked, but the part rattling inside was annoying. Being single and working long hours made it inconvenient to return. After about a month the unit would not receive the remote signals. I opened it up and found that the antenna for receiving the atomic clock signal had come unglued and was hanging by the leads. In my opinion it was poor construction and poor engineering to use only a dob of glue to hold a rod antenna in place. Other than that accuracy and ease of use seem reasonable."
5,Excellent Tool for knowing what is up for the day.,"We have this installed in our bathroom. Not only does it give us the accurate time (always), but lets us know what the outside temp is when preparing for the day.I like it's size, not to big and not to small. The color scheme goes well in our bathroom. I do wish the display had a back light so I could see it in the dark, but other than that I'm really happy with it, especially for the price. It's also seems to be fairly accurate on the outdoor sensor."
1,Very short life span,This product worked for only about six months before either the outside sensor or the internal receiver stopped working and I could no longer see the outside temperature. Battery replacement was futile.
4,Good Value,"Overall, it is and excellent product and we consult it evey morning when we get up. The atomic time update works well. I have only two concerns: It should have a backlight function so it could be better seen in the dark and, for whatever reason, the outside temperature display blanks after a few months (6-7 months) - either the battery runs down too fast (in my opinion) or the range of the unit is less than advertised ... annyoing, but not a major problem."
3,Decent,"This is a very standard, decent product. It has all the basics, nothing fancy but seems to be accurate and I am fairly pleased with it."
2,Not very accurate,"The wireless thermometer gives a reading 3-6 degrees higher than other thermometers I have (which I believe are accurate). When other thermometers read 0F, this one reads 6F, at 32F, this one reads 36F and when other ones read 60F, this one reads 63F.I wrote a note to the manufacturer, and was told that there is no way to calibrate the unit. They told me that I could return it if I was unhappy."
3,trouble with setting,having trouble getting it set - the outdoor temperature is off by about 5 degrees and can't get it to reset - nice looking unit - easy to read - difficult to get set up
1,outside temp did not work,Remote thermometer did not work. Interior temperature okay but bought it to measure outside.
1,Sensor quit working,"I gave this as a Christmas gift, the sensor (placed in a protected area) quit working within 3 months of the gift. Unrealiable product. Of course as it worked when it purchased I didn't keep the receipt, add to that the fact that Amazon will not accept returns on anything older than 30 days even if it is a gift."
4,Great for the price,"Bought this for my wife. I really like the thermometer.The good:Large digits - I can read it from across the room.Automatic time - After 24 hours, the time will automatically update.Temperature matches my car's gauge - within 2 degrees.The less than good:Setup is a pain - forget about the time, it will fix itselfNeeds a back light - can't see it in the dark."
3,La Crosse WS-9013U-CBP,"The item was received in good condition. I set it up according to the instruction booklet,(Letting them read each other for the time recommended). The indoor temp seems right on, but the outside temp is 4 degrees higher than what it actually is. Don't know why? I have the remote in a good spot, just has always read high for the outside temp. I might be returning this if I can't figure it out."
3,Not too shabby....,It's usually 2-3 degrees off on the outside temp but if you want 100% accuracy be prepared to spend $200 bucks on that type of system. We can look at ours in the AM and at least tell how heavy or light of a jacket we need to wear and the big numbers makes it easy to look at a glance from a short distance.
4,"easy setup, outside temp couple degrees off","This unit looks good and works ok as well. The time auto sets and the remote temp sensor updates all within a couple minutes of inserting the batteries. NOTE: install the batteries in the remote temp sensor first to facilitate setup. The remote unit reported the temp very accurately initially however after apprx a month of use, and 20deg F (or less) temps outside, the temp is now being reported several (2-3) degrees more than other mercury thermometers I have. I brought it inside to compare with the inside temp and there was the couple deg difference. However for my needs it's not a big deal; like you can feel the difference between 19 and 16 deg F. ;-)"
1,Don't buy it,"I bought this item from Fry's about 6 months ago.... it already doesn't work. Of course, it never really did in the first place, except at night. If there was any sun outside, it would say the temperature was well over 100 degrees... And before you say it, no, it was not in direct sunlight. The outdoor sensor was placed in the shade and apparently caught a reflection from somewhere.This is all irrelevant anyway, because after about 4 months, it stopped receiving data from the outside sensor and instead just displayed --- even with new batteries"
5,Classic,"Clocking in at almost 70 minutes, Joshua Redman's Elastic is a sonic tour-de-force that ranks as one of his best. The songs run the gamut: electric funk (al la Eddie Harris), simmering ballads, and straight-out fusion. In the classic Blue Note years this would have been a double LP set. As a single CD, it is well worth the price.[DW]"
5,This is music,"Man, I was blown away by this album. All the songs are excellent and Joshua's sound and style really have developed. The band disregards the barriers of jazz and delves into everything from Oumou Sangare to Led Zepplin to John Coltrane. This music is intellectual, but simple and it all is honest music. Wow, Joshua Redman has found his band! SEE THIS GROUP LIVE YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!!"
3,"While I applaud Redman's desire to reinvent, the end product",disappoints. I've seen him live and he can improvise with the best of them. So why does this disc feel like sophisticated noodling. My sense is that Joshua is woodshedding a bit and that this band is a means not an end. JR has still to plant his flag the way his contemporaries like Jason Moran and Greg Osby have. I have no doubt he will. This funk driven date isn't it but fun to listen to in the car.
4,Is this the future of Jazz?,"I have no idea (I just wanted something ponderous for a review title). In short, I agree with all that's been said to this point, except for the guy who called Redman a ""bebop revivalist."" There's nothing bebop-ish about Joshua Redman's playing or compositions."
2,disappointing cd,"This cd is really disappointing.The sound of the organ is awful first of all, and second the songs are not very good; but the main thing is, it's nothing original at all; compared to other musicians like Charlie Hunter who tries to make something fresh and new, this is boring and passe.I really liked some of the earlier work of Redman."
3,I Have Never Seen..,"I have to admit to buying this CD and becomming slightly disappointed, but netherless, Namie Amuro still remains one of my favourite idol singers. Why the disappointment then?Simple: the newly produced music didn't impress me at all. As a HUGE Amuro fan, I feel TK went slim on the over-all originality of the album. The vocal ranges of many of the songs weren't meant for her beautiful voice and made the quality a bit..dare I say.. out of tune. But despite all this, I still found this CD enjoyable and fun to listen to. Something Bout the Kiss and Love 2000 are in my opinion, very catchy songs and definatly give j-pop a fresh new sound.Personally I only recommend this album to die-hard Amuro fans since it may leave new commers a bit wary of her talents. If you haven't heard Amuro at all I definatly think you should check out her newer single ""Never End"" or one of her older, more classic tunes, ""Can You Celebrate?"""
1,Namie-chan...what have you done??!,"Uuuggghhh...hate this CD! What a disapointing dismal album. I'm a big Namie fan, I have all her albums, 90% of her singles, and her '95 concert DVD, so needless to say I snagged this the first chance I got without feeling a need to listen to it first. What a mistake! If you like soft R&B/Soul you may like this, but I don't, so I did'nt. If I wanted that I'd listen to Whitney Houston or TLC, but I wanted high-energy, catchy, in-your-face J-Pop. Why else would I buy a Namie CD?! There is one good song though - ""I Have Never Seen"". But I already had that single. Luckily, this appears to just be a brief departure/experiment for Namie. Her latest single, ""Please Smile Again"" kicks! BTW - what's up with the title?? ""Genius 2000""??! What an ego! What kind of pompous, arrogant title is that?!"
1,SNORE,"I haven't read it all, but I did page through it and read many parts of it. This book gave me the best laugh I've had in a long, long time. There is a laughably bad love scene. I read parts of it to my friend and we had tears streaming down our faces from laughing so hard. A quote: ""Usually, we made love at my place in Manhattan, but I had stayed in Williamsburg with Tilla because we had come from a family birthday party and were scheduled to go to brunch in Manhattan with Mariah and one of her ex-husbands who had turned out to be a set-designer friend of Tilla's."" A longer scene set-up will not be had. And, later: ""...I watched his eyes open and shut, open and shut with his thrusts...."" This scene was horrendously bad, but just about every sentence I read had the same pretentious, over-indulgent self-awareness. It gets tedious and annoying. I would not read this book in its entirety.Try that one on for size--opening and shutting your eyes while thrusting, I mean. It's pretty fun."
1,Unable to fly,"Having taken contact with Jan Garbarek's music through the works he performed in cooperation with Hilliard Ensemble - ""Officium"" and ""Mnemosyne"" -, I became curious and intended to deepen my knowledge about his earlier compositions, and the hearing of ""All those born with wings"" is an example of that; unfortunately, a bad one...This record was for me a complete desillusion. Expecting to find here a work characterized by the long, peaceful and relaxing solo saxophone music proper of ""Officium"", I only faced an awful mixture of musical experimentalism accompanied by an extremely painful sax shrillness and themes imagined by a third rate imitator of Vangelis.Definitively, this is a record without wings, where the third track is the only one that escapes from disaster, having something interesting to give to the listener. Everything else is to forget!"
3,Celectra Battery Charger,"This is NOT a toy. It is an inexpensive battery charger for 1 to 3 series LiPO batteries for models. It is limited to only one battery at a time. After a trial, I decided to replace this with a larger charger with more capability."
5,Hanes Underwear,This is an excellent product It provides good fit (unlike some other name brands). I had a question for the seller's customer service and the answer was comprehensive and reassuring. Shipping was prompt.
1,Goodbye HANES,"Listen up HANES! I don't wear size 36-38! I WEAR SIZE 36! I've been wearing your brand for decades! No more! I'll find another brand in exact sizes! Signed: ""Mad-as-hell & refuse to wear the wrong size underwear."" :)"
3,Caveat Emptor,"Be careful if you order this item. Double-check what you are getting from the vendor before you commit to the purchase. Even though this page states that you are buying the 7-pair pack, at least one of these vendors pulls a bait and switch and tries to pass off the 3-pair pack. Happened to me, fortunately I caught it and cancelled the order before getting stuck. Three stars due to vendor dishonesty. The shorts themselves are fine."
1,"Manufacturer's ""skimping"" leads to an unusable product.","In the 4X size, the manufacturer did not allow enough material overlap in the fly area and consequently the fly is always hanging open. Unacceptable!!!"
1,They screwed up sizing to keep prices down...can't get a good fit!,"Instead of having correct sizes, they just lump two or more sizes together and assume they will fit. Well, THEY DON'T. I wear a size 36 and the so-called 36-38 size is WAY too big. I will never buy this brand again."
4,Good for big guys,The are comfortable and fit well. Some brands of 3X are not quite the right size but these Hanes are nice. I would definitely buy these again.
4,Hanes 2 XL underwear,this is a good brand ..been buying them for a long time; bought this larger size....they are comfortable and fit well
2,What could have been a great album.....,"When I first heard that a singer with the name of Slaughter, I thought ""Great, this guy's got to be a heavy singer!"". Put that together with Vinnie Vincent's talents and you'll have a great album. But no....Unfortunatley, Mark Slaughter sounds like nothing more than a choir boy with an attitude, and his vocals, sadly enough, weigh this album down consideribly.It's very upsetting because there really are some good songs here, ""That time of year"" and ""Ashes to ashes"" are the stand out tracks.Every time I hear Slaughter's girlish vocals on this album I just want to cringe. Maybe the formula worked in the 80's, but never again after that."
2,All Systems Go,"This album isn't as good as the first VVI album. It has a few good songs. The songs I like are ""Ashes to Ashes,"" ""Love Kills,"" and ""That Time of Year."" It's too eighties sounding."
1,Second Effort: All Systems Gone,"To be sure, the re-release of the two VV albums on CD was a great thing, since many of us were still into tapes the first time around, but I somehow managed to miss the 2nd album when it first came out. Now, I'm glad that I did. Basically, take everything you love about the first one, including:1.) Crystal Clear Production2.) Outlandish, Shredding Guitars3.) A Tremendous Vocalist With Unlimited Range4.) OriginalityNow, throw these things out the window, make the album the exact opposite, and you have ""ALL SYSTEMS GO.""There's a reason why it's $4.99 used. Vinnie, I'm sorry your name is stuck on Mark Slaughter's sad debut."
3,"Invasion came and then all systems went,","All right I was very pleased with invasion and So i picked up all systems go, I don't care for this ablum much and heres why,Every song on this album sounds like a song off the first album, hell some off the songs sound like the only differnce is the words, the two instrumentals suck and compare nothing to Aces Fractured mirror series. the guy on Vocals sounds like a wannabe of the first guy. it acutally sounds like they used voice effects on his vocals to make him sound like the previous singer.whatever the case, I thought this ablum would grow on me but it is nothing original you get this album on the first album with differnt lyrics. sorry vinnie but this one sucked.the only good song on here is let Freedom rock."
3,definition of buttrock,"This album is hilarious. I can't believe how much I listened to it when it came out. The guy that wrote ""so bad it's good"" is dead on. Ever since the first time I heard Mark Slaughter's voice, I could never figure out what it reminded me of - fingernails on a blackboard? Everytime he sings the word ""me"" or ""everything"" (anything with an ""eeeee"" sound)....well you get the picture. Makes me cringe."
2,The back picture of this album says it all,"This was a suprising reissue from Capitol records and i heard this on vinyl years ago and was not impressed. Mark Slaughter may have been alot better in his own band a few years later but here its his voice(and indeed he is the ""voice"" as his job listed in the line-up credits)that big time ruins this album. Most of the songs sound the same especially the guitar solo's by the band namesake Vinnie Vincent. 2 of the ballads sound very similar but the song ""Ecastasy"" the 3rd ballad is the best from this album with more of an acoustic approach. These problems are why this band didnt make it or make themselves distinctive from all the other hair bands. The bonus tracks are nothing but instrumentals so nothing essental to hear. If you dont get a headache by the time you reach the end its a miracle"
3,"WHY DID THEY EDIT ""LOVE KILLS""?!?","First off, I am a huge KISS and Vinnie Vincent fan. His work with KISS was outstanding and the first Invasion release, while WAY over the top with glam metal cheese, was amazing. With ""All Systems Go"" though, he seemed to jump on the late 80's extremely polished hair metal train and came up with a CD that lacks any punch. It fits in perfectly with the likes of Winger and Warrant. It's not bad, just nothing special. Still has great nostalgia value for me.One question though. WHY did they edit ""Love Kills""? The part at the end of the guitar solo where Mark Slaughter sings "" Love's Dying ...etc."" is cut out completely and the part toward the beginnig of the song where he sings ""You're a lifetime ago and...etc."" is also cut out. WTF?"
4,Great album,"This is a great album, one I picked up years ago when I first discovered Slaughter. The guitar work by Vinnie is amazing, though much more prominent on the first album. I wasn't a big fan of original singer Fleishman (funny one reviewer here says he can't take Slaughter singing, but I was the other way around). This album was just a little too slick. If only they could have put out a 3rd album with the best of worlds from the first two. ""Love Kills"" is the big hit, but my fav is ""That Time of Year"". Oh yeah, and I don't care if this is from the ""hair band era"" or not, good music is good music (just don't watch the videos!)."
4,rare gem,"Vinnie Vincent was a rare gem within the 80's rock genre. His songwriting ablility and razor-edge guitar work ran circles around KISS, who'd made a big mistake in not making him a full-time member (considering how much he contributed to the band during his tenure there).I'm a huge KISS fan, and would never take anything from any of the members that have existed throughout the band's career. However, the way Vincent was treated while a member represented the chink in the armor of the legendary band.All Systems Go is not much different from the previous album. Well-written rock lyrics, Blazing fuitar work, and a catchy rythm are all present. It was a winning formula, and it's sad that he did't get the acolades he deserved in his solo career."
2,Darling shoe. Murder on the feet,"These shoes were tight, hard and no arch support. After 1 hour I felt like someone had beat the bottoms of my feet with a lead pipe. I had to leave my nephews wedding early my feet hurt so bad. Not only was dancing out of the question, I didn't even want to walk to the rest room. At 40 plus yrs of age when the pain in my feet wins over my need to tinkle...that's a miserable shoe!"
1,HUGE MISTAKE!,"I purchased this ... something, but what Iv'e got was amazing. A small soft USED dirty little RUSTY ball. I sent back to them, and I emailed like 20 times, but NO ONE EVER answered. And they kept my money."
4,dressy bessy-mmm mmm good,This album is short but sweet. If you enjoy this check out the Power Puff Girls soundtrack and their other full length albums. Good Stuff!
3,I did not receive the item I ordered,"I did receive a basket, with tea and a wooden spoon and letter opener, not the item described, not the basket I had chosen. I am disappointed that I did not receive theitem described, although the item is ok, and I will find a use for the basket that came, it is just a plain basket that can be used as a bread basket, it was not the bag with handles that I was expecting and for what I had planned uses for, I feel I was misled in what I was purchasing."
2,another run of the mill from a Cat that had a chance,10-14 years ago Harry Connick Jr seemed to be on His Way at making His own oath Musically&He was tapping into a Sinatra zone of presentation&Overall vibe.but somewhere in the middle of the 90's Harry Connick Jr went to Being a Cat on a Mission to a Guy trying to Being a Jack of all trades&in the overall process seems just like a Mere footnote which is truly a waste just like the first track on this set.His voice&Presentation hasn't evolved much at all&unlike a Decade ago Harry can't just have a cool run&bring you back in.at this stage of the Game Connick is just getting by&can do this for as long as there is folks willing to go along but will He ever challenge Himself again? I doubt it.
5,It freakin' swings,"First off, Ned Goold sounds like Rouse. Secondly, Harry Connick Jr., while best know for his singing, is a monster on the piano player, as evidenced on this album. This album not only showcases Connick's excellent compistion skills, it also presents a quartet with a great group concept. I think of Monks quartet everytime I hear it. It belongs on the shelf of anyone that has the ability to actually hear jazz. Branford Marsalis should be commended for releasing this album that major labels most liekly wouldn't touch because it is not accessible to the masses."
3,Average compared to others in the Northern Exposure Series,"It was with great anticipation that I awaited the arrival of my West Coast CD. I was already the owner (and admirer) of all of the other CDs in the Northern Exposure series, and couldn't wait for this CD to arrive. Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed by this CD, since IMHO it doesn't measure up to the fluidity and diversity of their other works. Sure, it's still a good CD, but I'm comparing it to their other work. I found it a little monotonous at times and rather repetitive. Furthermore, there weren't any tracks that stood out or captured my attention. If you're a newcomer to the series, you're better off going with the East Coast edition, or the first in the series."
2,"Please, Mr. Digweed, get to the point!","The smooth, calm, but most of all somnolent sound of this CD can easily put ANYONE to sleep! Although I am used to hearing trance music without lyrics, this amassment of songs makes up possibly one of the most boring CDs I own. Every song seems to have a build up to the next, and once the music ends, there is a big void. Many people do not like lyrics in any dance song, however, with words not in play, the CD lacks a hook that keeps the listener attentive - thus, peaceful sleep if listening at night. Many of the songs also feel dated with a pinch of tedium ... perhaps instead of this CD, a Sasha + John Digweed fan may enjoy Communicate, a CD with more distinct songs."
3,My least favorite in the Northern Exposure series,"Not much really stands out on this mix, more of a cookie-cutter trance mix that is not up to the calibre of the rest of the Northern Exposure series. It doesn't have the intensity and originality that this duo normally has with their mixes. Even with my let down expectations, this is still a better CD than most of the other cookie-cutter trance mixes that have been put out the same time as this one. I gave this three stars for it's rating within the Northern Exposure series, but as a trance album overall, it would get 4 stars. Get this CD if you're looking to own the entire series, otherwise, I'd skip this and get the East Coast CD."
4,great & deep mix from the masters,One of the best mixes from S&D. The only one that's better is probably the East Coast mix.
5,This Album is Gorgeous,This album is unbelievable and is a must have. It is not the kind of trance that you would dance to. All you have to do is just relax with a loved one and enjoy. My friend introduced me to their music and almost cried because of how wonderful it is. It is by far one of the best albums in my collection.
3,Sequels Are Usually Disappointing,The second volume in the Northern Exposure Series follows that very well known trend amongst movies where the original is usually considered the best while the sequel ends up being a disappointment.The first release is a classic that will stand against the test of time despite being two years the junior to this album. Northern Exposure II: West Coast is outdated with tacky-sounding trance. Glowsticks and pacifiers anyone?2.5/5 stars.
5,Classic - really is worth all 5 stars,"I don't go buck wild over every cd I buy and give 5 stars because it sounds cool. But as others have said - NE: West coast stands the test of time and is worth the price listed. The buildup to Pete Heller's remix of Netherworld is one of the best I've heard.Be sure to check out the East Coast edition - it's very different, but a good purchase still (I'd give it 4 stars)."
2,Don't buy this for students,"This is way over-rated. Do NOT buy this if you intend to show it to students. I bought it for high school students and they are immediately turned off by the old narrator with English accent. Considering what an intense life full of relationship and artistic drama Picasso led, this DVD manages to make it boring. There are some insights into his relationships, but overall I have to give this a thumbs down as an educational tool."
1,This is jazz????,"Did the other reviewers listen to the same CD that I did? Sorry -this is nothing more than well-played crap - and by crap I don't mean any disrespect. But if I want to hear this kind of elevator music, I'll dial up some company's customer service line and listen to the music on hold. To even call this stuff jazz is an insult to any real jazz musician (or, frankly, any other musician, as well)."
5,This CD Is Hot!!!!!,This is one of Steve Cole's greatest CD's. This stayed in my CD player for two years. Every track is great and very diverse.
5,Steve Cole makes it happen..,"The soulful beat of this CD alone makes it worth purchasing. Steve Cole is not only a masterful musician in his own right, but he wisely surrounds himself with genius. You will smile, snap your fingers and listen to it again and again...."
2,"Too many, cookie cutter, smooth jazz vocal tracks","I loooooove Steve Cole (met him a few years ago at the House of Blues) and I try to support him (I buy his cds, even before I've heard them). Most of this cd is good, but please stop with those smooth jazz vocal tracks that all sound like the same people on every smooth jazz cd, singing the same song.Love you Steve, but in the future, only one or two vocal tracks, and please make sure they're unique like (Together Again) from the Between Us cd.Still love ya.Pat B."
5,party pleasure,I love this new Steve Cole Cd...........this record was so much fun to play at a party...has a cool sexy vibe with some really fun surprises.a perfect addition to my cd mixes... hit repeat and it plays really well.
1,Twisted Path,"From the beginning of the film the acting just made me cringe. The older brother seemed to be the best out of the whole cast, and I didnt see him very much. The only plus was the price, and with that I suppose I should expect to get what I pay for. Every now and then though you will get lucky and find a decent movie for less than 20 bucks. This one is not in that category, but if you have watched everything there is, it cant hurt to waste a couple hours on. Just find it at redbox and get a cheap case of beer with the rest of your money."
3,Well it's pretty,"This isn't to bad of a controller but, it broke about 20 mins into play. It fits nice in your hand and has a nice rubber grip texture. The cord seems a little shorter than the regular controller. Looks pretty but in the long run it was worthless cause it broke really easy."
4,Another solid entry in the series,"In this story about everyone's favorite tiny family, the Littles are moved to take a trip to meet other families like themselves. Cousin Dinky is the only small person who moves from family to family freely, and he gets the ball rolling when he suggests a meeting of small families. Lucy and Tom want so desperately to meet other children their own size that a trip is arranged, despite the dangers that the outside world presents.This book capitalizes on the elements that make the series a success, by presenting realistic obstacles posed by a giant world. The differences between the Littles and the Specks is fascinating, and the interaction between the small people and potentially fierce animals is exciting as well.Buy this series for your child, and let him or her go from beginning to end for some good, clean entertainment that will keep them reading until the last page has been turned."
5,Lara takes the prize,My Son was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes when he was 3. Most of the books I purchased to read with him felt very sad. The children in the books were not able to eat regular food and their lives seemed restricted. And then I read Lara Takes Charge. I was thrilled to find a book that is positive that focuses on the fact that the child is normal and can do everything that all other children do- that is how I want my child to live his life. This is an uplifting happy book and my son and I love it.
2,Overpriced,There is more writing in the description than in the entire book. Written at a pre-K level. Overcharged for the size of the book and value
2,But kids with diabetes already ARE normal!,"I really felt uncomfortable when reading this book and decided almost immediately not to read it to my daughter who was just diagnosed with Type 1. The message throughout the book is, ""I'm normal! I have diabetes, but I'm normal!"". I didn't want to give my child the idea that anyone would have thought she was different in to begin with, just because she has diabetes. Just like kids who have to wear glasses, she just has a part in her body that doesn't work as well as it should.I found many of the kids books on this topic to be similar. Be sure to read the books first to know if it's inline with what you want to communicate to your kid!"
4,Great book but why so expensive???,"This is a terrific book-very upbeat and positive.It's probably the best book written for kids with diabetes. However, it is really quite expensive and because of the cost, I wonder if it is not reaching some children with diabetes who would benefit from the wonderful message therein?"
4,Excellent,Dr. Abartis is my Shakespeare professor this term at St. Cloud State University. Even if I wouldn't have known her personally I would have loved this book. It is absolutely brilliant.
2,How predictable,"I'm fascinated by native american novels, as well as good romances. I also understand that the author writes her novels in liesure, but i didn't find this book at all entertaining. i read through it quickly hoping it would get better, but to no avail.All the events that ensued were extremely predictable with little build up. Just one thing after the next as the characters guessed. i was also annoyed with the heroine. she was dumb and thick headed, i was thoroughly perturbed by her decisions.The plot however was alright, the execution and story telling was lacking."
3,bad packaging,I am very happy with the CD itself however the item i purchased came in a broken case due to poor packaging for shipment.
4,A Chick Band?,"Arena Rock... great sweeping attacks on guitar, great vocals, touchy feely lyrics. A fine representation of what embodied Arena Rock or Hair Bands of the '80s. Strip off the makeup and Aqua-Net and you still have solid musicanship at the end (a highly refined end) of the era and genre."
3,For real Fairport fanatics only,"OK, I really do like Fairport Convention. I knew when I bought this box that some of the material was, well, less than audiophile quality. However, I still feel that, for the price of this set, some of the remastering of the source material is subpar. There are several ""out-takes that have really excessive tape hiss and SOME of this hiss could surely have been removed without affecting the music. The quality is so uneven that, to me, it makes this set difficult listening.That being said, I do like some of the older out-takes and radio and TV broadcasts. I am particularly a fan of '67-70 Fairport, and there are some nice things from that era.The book is wonderful, and probably helps justify the price. But, I believe the sound quality is not what it could be."
5,Benzadrine inhaler,This is a very good product for anyone who has seasonal allergie's and/or colds. It helps clear conjestion immediately-a better choice for a stuffy nose than pills!
4,It works - but some issues,"I had a pretty bad cold (maybe the flu) and needed some decongesting. This stuff worked pretty well when I could inhale enough to get a decent dose. When I couldn't, it wasn't much use. Unfortunately I did get some stinging & burning, too (some of the side-effects). I also wish the decongesting effect lasted longer as sometimes it didn't seem to last very long though that might have been because I was seriously congested and may not have been able to inhale enough of the medicated vapors.Note that it says on the packaging that you should not use it for more than 3 days, and that frequent or prolonged use may cause nasal congestion to recur or worsen... so one should probably not come to rely on using this product heavily.But the product did provide some much wanted relief."
5,The best inhaler you can ever buy!,The benzedrex inhaler is the best one on the market. You usually cannot find it readily available in stores and will probably have to order from Amazon. Don't waste your money on other brands. Nothing will reduce stuffiness and actually decrease swelling like the benzedrex inhaler. Keep a new one around especially during the allergy and cold season.
3,er umm ugh,"I think it may work, I'm not really sure... it smells like cheap ditch weed, not that I'd know anything about that! I don't use it much simply because of the smell, keeps it from being addictive!"
5,Benzedrex is the best Nasal Inhaler we have ever used!!!!!!!!!,"It is really hard at times to find the 'Benzedrex Nasal Inhaler' in stores now a-days, once you find out the BEST of the BEST, you won't settle for Less. I sure hope Amazon keeps selling them because we will be back for more, we bought two packages of 3 (6 inhalers total), THANKS FOR READING MY POST, Bob in Mesa, AZ!"
5,Excellent but little pricey,"I love this whole program but I do feel like for the current economy it might be too expensive for the very people that might get the most out of it. I will write longer review later but I like the programs Committee Meeting Exercise, Optimal Performance - Forming a Protective Atmosphere,and Eliminating Self Sabotage the best. These are very practical programs and Dr. Fiore has a nice pleasing voice. If you can afford the program it will be well worth your time and money."
1,Doesn't anyone know about Vinny's illegal speeding on this??,"In case you hadn't heard, Vinny Vincent was accused (and in a sense convicted) of falsely speeding up the solos on this CD. From what I understand, they sped up the tape during his solos to make him appear much faster than he really is and to try to create an ""Yngwie buzz"" about him. If you listen to any of his KISS songs and any of Vinny's next CDs (which proves he was convicted), you will not hear ANY of the shredding that was on this CD. In addition, if you ever saw him live with KISS (which I did) or Invasion (and you can remember), he was not capable of playing like this CD. Lastly, watch him try to pull off the solo in the ""Boyz Are Gonna Rock"" video and you'll see his hands cannot keep up the music (which is probably why he played the solo with a microphone instead of a pick in the video).Either way you slice it, he was never that good of a guitarist. PLUS he is/was as ugly as sin {sorry Vinny, no offense} ;>)"
2,The Invasion that Failed,"Vinnie Vincent is a really good guitarist, and seemed like the perfect talent to build a band around. With a high profile launch from KISS, Vincent should have been able to parlay his guitar wizardry into mainstream success. Unfortunately, Vincent's songwriting ability was the chink in his metal armor. None of the songs featured here are awful...but they aren't that great either. Take the least memorable song from the ""Lick It Up"" album by KISS and multiply it by 10. The tunes are all pretty pedestrian, and while the guitar tracks are really good, there really isn't enough difference between Vincent's shredding, and what was available on hundreds of hair metal releases coming out at the same time. If you are a hair metal fan, you may enjoy popping this in every now and again, but it's not going to become a heavy favorite. But for under $10, it may be worth it just to escape from today's over-produced, under performed junk from the latest American Idol winner."
3,It was the 80's,"I was reading the reviews and it brought back memories. I learned a few things that I did not know. Getting the boot from KISS and his own band for having a monstrous ego. How bad do you have to be to get the boot from your namesake band? Anyway, the music is 80's. What do you want. Personally I originally got this one because of Bob Rock being on it. I thought he was extremely hot and a very cool drummer. The music is ok and it really is too bad that Vinnie thought he was a cool breeze, because he was a monstrous guitar player. I recommend this if you want to remember what a lot of the 80's was about. I will always be a metal head and this was part of it. Good or bad. Take it for what it is, metal. Believe me there is worse."
1,Bad clock from dubious company,"This is my second piece of hardware from LaCrosse. The first is a weather station that has worked poorly and evoked ""who cares"" responses from their customer service. I made the mistake of ordering a second item, thinking I couldn't have bad luck again. Wrong. The clock arrived with the second had not working at all from the moment a battery was inserted. It was also bent (a separate defect) so that it would have been blocked by the minute hand even if it HAD been working. Their return policy is that the customer pays for return shipping no matter whose fault the defect is. Sheesh. Two strikes, you're out of my list of technology manfacturers. The customer service rep this time was very polite and clear -- I just find the policy punitive and sub-standard to other, more customer-friendly businesses."
2,Atomic (?) Clock,"I have been using this unit for about ten months now. The clock runs well but I have already replaced the battery once. It seems that, if the clock is fast, periodically the clock has to pace through the 12 hours to reset. The other comments about this clock not adapting to the time change are absolutely true according to my experience also. In the fall, I had relatively little problem because I set the unit to Central time instead of Eastern until the unit finally corrected for the time change about a month later. Spring time change left me an hour off since the unit has no Atlantic setting. I did get them to send me a return number but, since it would cost me to send it back, I decided that it would not be worth my returning the clock...Caveat emptor!"
2,Nice looking; if it only worked,"I own another La Crosse radio frequency product (weather station) and have had wonderful success with it, so I assumed their analog clock would be no different (same technology right?). While I really liked the size of the clock, the nice black on white contrast, and the readability of the time, I had to return it because the second hand would only work sporadically, often stopping for hours. I would probably have been happy had the clock simply not had a second hand at all. But before I sent it back I tried all of the recommendations by La Crosse (resetting, new battery, facing the clock toward Colorado, etc.), I even sent them an email. In the end, nothing helped, and it took their ""customer support"" department more than a week to respond with the same suggestions as on their written documentation. It is likely this is just a lemon, and the next one would work fine, but who wants to deal with the chance it's just a poorly built product."
5,cool clock,I have been waiting til the time change to make this review so here it is. It works great!! I like it alot!
3,"GREAT CLOCK, BAD DST","We're another, bought the clock to solve the Daylight Saving time thing. Isn't that why you buy a radio adjusted clock. And now it doesn't adjust. I was impressed at how nice the clock is but very disappointed about the DST thing. It seems I'll have to call customer supprt and get on the list for a replacement."
1,DST doesn't work,"It was working last year, but this year, after the new DST. It doesn't work anymore. Stupid!"
5,Great Analog Wall Clock,"Have purchased 2 of these for my office and am buying 2 more for home. These are easy to set up, easy to read, and the self adjusting daylight savings time with the ""atomic"" function (self setting) is wonderful. Earlier reviewer mentioned how to reset when battery needs replacement which I found very helpful, so keep the set up instructions handy to refer to if and when you need to replace the batteries! Also purchased 2 of the larger 14 inch version and they're just as nice."
1,Don't Buy It!,"I bought the LaCross Technology WT-3102B Clock in 2011. Nice looking clock. Unfortunately, it only works when it feels like it. The second hand stopped working repeatedly. The whole thing stopped working several times. After a battery change, it would work for a few days. Each battery change required a get the ladder, climb up to get the clock, replace battery, climb up the ladder, rehang clock on wall, and put ladder back. They claim the battery has to have at least a 7 year future expiration date!! Good luck with that. I finally found some Duracells with an expiration of 7-2018. The clock worked for a couple of days and then the second hand stopped AGAIN. It's keeping time OK except for that.La Crosse Technology WT-3102B 10-Inch Atomic Analog ClockThe DST did work, so that's a plus. I get the impression their Customer Service is to stroke you until you go buy a different clock that actually works."
3,"Like the looks, second hand already not working","I bought this clock for our media room, and within a month the second hand stopped working. The clock works, but the second hand is stuck in place. Too late to exchange it for a new one. Oh well."
1,A Clock with a mind of it's own,"We have purchased 2 La Crosse clocks. One works great without any problems at all. This clock has a mind of its own. It didn't work with the new daylight savings time so I switched it to a different time zone (I am in Mountain Standard Time) and it worked fine. When it did switch time, it started behaving weird. It will rotate the minute hand for hours at a time. I changed batteries and pushed a few random buttons but it just would continuously try to set itself. Periodically, the time would be correct and we would forget about it. Then later, we would hear this strange buzzing and track it down to the clock and it was resetting itself. My wife has been nailed with being late by paying attention to this clock a few times.If you want an entertaining clock that may or may not give you the correct time, then this is it. Otherwise, you may want to look elsewhere."
5,The Perfect Wall Clock,"In considering that I purchased this item for my bedroom, I would have to say that it is perfect. For aesthetic reasons I preferred an analog wall clock, but the thought of hearing the second hand tick all night was not an option until I found this item by LaCrosse. It could not be anymore perfect, as its looks, PRICE, and self (time) adjusting qualities has made this an. ""M.F."" (Major Find). Now I can sleep through the Daylight Savings time adjustments not having to worry about the actual adjustment of my clock, but whether or not I will be an hour early, or late to work."
3,Partially Broke Already???,"Great looking clock. Looks sharp on the wall in my office, and the atomic/auto time setting feature works well. However, one week into it and the second hand stops working. The minute and hour still tell the correct time, but the second hand is stuck at :08. Not a big enough problem to send back and I really like the classic appearance. I would not hesitate to buy another one, hopefully with second hand with more that a one week life span."
2,No correction for Daylight Saving Time,"These clocks work perfectly except... When the government changed the dates of the changeover from Standard Time and Daylight Time, the clock ignored the change. My clock does not know it is now DST and so it is off by an hour for several weeks each spring and autumn. Lacrosse customer support is virtually nonexistent. Beware!April 2008 - At last, LaCrosse replaced the clock and it is fine now!"
1,No springing forward here,"My other atomic clocks all updated themselves today to reflect the time change. I am wondering what radio is controlling this particular clock. I tried taking out the battery and reinserting it per the directions and still the clock updates itself one hour behind. I urge you not to purchase this clock if you are buying it so you can have a clock that will automatically update itself and keep corect time. If the clock is truly radio controlled, there is no reason that it should take up to five days to set the correct time as other reviewers here suggest."
1,It Doesn't Work - I tried 4 times,"I bought 4 of these clocks for my office. Not one works. It was an adventure everyday to see what time the clock might say. One of the clocks turned and turned for about 3 days straight, the hands just kept going round and round. I think it was trying to set itself, so I just let it go........round and round for 72 hours! So here I am on Amazon again, looking to buy 4 new clocks. What a waste."
1,Waste of Time,"I ordered one of the clocks. The first arrived with broken glass, so I ordered a replacement. It also arrived with broken glass. The boxes were undamaged, so the problem is with the packaging done by the manufacturer I put a battery in it to see if it would still work with no glass, and it is unable to receive the time from the atomic clock over two days. There is no way to manually set the time.These clocks are rediculously fragile, and unreliable. Suggest you do not waste your time buying on."
2,Advertised,"The clock was not as advertised. It was to be radio controlled but it did not change according to the new daylight savings time date. LaCrosse told me, via the telephone, that this model would change according to a preset, programed date. It was not advertised as such and I would not have purchased it knowing that information. It does keep perfect time."
4,LaCrosse replaced defective clock,"After my first LaCrosse failed the new DST specs, I wrote a negative review (1-star, the lowest). LaCrosse customer service - though they were always unavailable by phone - did respond via email and promised to send a replacement product, which they did in June 2007. They say this model WILL comply to radio-controlled instructions to set the time unlike the one I got initially, which can only be verified this Fall. They also said to destroy the defective model.The fact that they actually sent me a replacment free of charge and did not insist on making me jump through hoops returning the ""defective"" one leads me to believe they're a reputable company. I'm rating them 4-stars.If in the Fall this model fails, I'll rate them a 1-star; otherwise, I'll rate them 5.For now, 4-stars."
4,It's the battery,"I read the reviews before purchasing this and was a bit hesitant. It seemed to work great for some people but for others there were constant problems. Mine worked fine for 2 weeks then started losing the time every day. I tried everything but could not get it to hold the time. When I went to LaCrosse's tech support website, I read that almost all returned clocks they received were due to battery issues. I didn't really believe that because I had used a brand new, name brand alkaline battery and still had problems. But I tried one of the new high capacity lithium batteries this time and the clock has worked fine ever since (about 6 months). It seems to be one of those electronic devices that simply will not work with anything but a fresh, fully charged battery. Even a slightly drained battery seems to make this clock non-functional. So for those who have this clock and can't get it to work properly, I suggest trying a lithium battery. I think that will solve your problem."
4,All was great except minute hand is not positioned quite right,"The vendor was great, the clock keeps great time, no complaints there. One minor problem is that the positioning of the minute hand between the dial markings is often not in proportion to the number of seconds into the minute. For example the seconds hand might show one third of the way through the minute (at 20sec) while the minute hand shows that 2/3 of the minute has passed. This descrepancy means you can not rely on the position of the minute hand to estimate the number of seconds past the minute. Not a big deal, but for this price the minute hand should be positioned to match the seconds hand."
1,Great When It Works,"Clock movement stopped working three months after purchase, suddenly and unexpectedly. Save your money."
3,Has a problem of self-setting at daylight savings time change,"This clock generally does allright, except1. when the time changes2. when the battery dies and a new one is insertedIt is now 4 pm, and the clock is still waiting for ""a special shade of green"" to come up with the right time. It is stuck at 8 am!There is no way of manually setting the clock. It will do it on its own time (pun alert!) whenever that might be in a 24-hour period. I sure hope it knows what time it is tomorrow morning."
1,Wish I could leave zero stars,"This clock has confirmed the old adage... even a broken clock is right twice a day.This is my third, and last, La Crosse clock. The first two stopped functioning shortly after the warranty expired. Despite writing twice to La Crosse, I never heard back. Being a glutton for punishment, I bought a third (this model), hoping it was a fluke with the previous model I ordered. No such luck. This one stopped functioning only two months after being put into service, exhibiting the same failure mode as the other twoI may be a slow learner, but I have learned. Poor quality clocks combined with dismal customer service, means this is my last La Crosse product.Don't waste your money.A person would have to be an incredible fool to waste their money on this, or any other La Crosse product. Zero customer service. Poor quality. I can't say enough bad things about this company and their products."
3,Some Problems; mostly ok clock,"I bought two of these to replace some wall clocks that were always either showing the wrong time or out of battery. I like the simple design. I have a digital LaCross alarm clock that works perfectly. One of the two new ones has problems. The second hand stops completely. I have restarted it twice (taken the battery out and let it resync), and it works for a day or two and then the second hand stops. Not really worth sending back, but the reliability seems quite low.Update. I took the glass off the clock and found the second hand bent too far upward. Bent it back down and it works fine. Now they both are going well and the battery (one) seems to last. We have a more complicated digital display La Crosse one (with date, temp, outside temp, moon, etc.), which uses two AA bateries that last only about 30 days."
1,Only buy this clock if you need a paperweight,"I bought the first of these in September. First of all it would never atomatically set so I had to set it by hand. Then a month later the second hand stopped working. Two months after I bought it it stopped working completely. I contacted Amazon and they immediately replaced it (thank you Amazon). I got the next one, put the battery in, and nothing. I went to the store and bought brand new Duracell batteries... and nothing. I sent the clock back for a refund. I should have believed all of the reviews below relating the same story.I have three other La Crosse clocks in my house that work perfectly... not a moments problem... however this model has serious problems... stay away.If it were possible to give negative stars for this item I would."
4,"Quiet? No, I can hear it tick....","I was looking for an atomic clock that was silent for my den, a room about 12 x 12. I found only 1 atomic silent clock, but it was about $40, and I didn't like the look. Several reviews on another website said that they could not hear this clock. I suggest a hearing test for them. While not as loud as the clock it replaced, it does have a tick that is audible anywhere in the room. That said, I have used it for about 3 weeks, and most of the time, my brain tunes out the tick. Best part is the exact time set every day by the Atomic Clock in CO."
3,slow set-up,"despite placing clock in numerous locations to improve radio signal, finally had to manually set the clock. we're still waiting to see if it remains accurate. otherwise, nice looking clock."
1,These really stink.,We purchased 30 of these. Half of them have failed. The hands just spin and spin. La Crosse states this indicates they need new batteries. They still do it even with new batteries. They are cheap because they DON'T WORK.
1,Second hand stopped working.,"I bought this clock to replace another that I had for 5 years. I tried changing the batteries and it quit. So I bought this one. I loaded the battery and it functioned fine for about 2 weeks until the second hand quit panning around. I tried to reset it and it quit altogether. sigh! I saved my old clock and went to find it and lo and behold it was working again! Why? I have not a clue. So, I put that one back up and the new La Crosse is just sitting there being correct only twice in a day."
4,Works well but slow on the Daylight savings time changes,"I bought this clock from Amazon August, 2005 and it's been great most of the time. I needed a clock with a sweep second hand and an easy to read face and this met my needs.The only problem I've had is with the daylight savings time updates and with this last change I waited a week and it did not update. I put in a new battery and it went to 12:00 and stayed, during the next few days it went to 4:00 and stayed then to 8:00 and stayed? I nearly tossed it thinking I'd had my five years of use but it finally went to the correct time and has been perfect since. Still, for the cost I would buy another one just don't toss it out too quickly!"
1,DST doesn't work,"I bought four of these and all fail to observe DST and I'm stuck with incorrect time, I cannot use the timezone trick because I'm already in EST.Without proper DST, these are junks. My Radio Shack digital atomic clock adjusted to DST perfectly, so it's not a signal problem.By the way, it seems the clock only update itself once during the night. If you are a light sleeper it may wake you up when hands are ticking forward.Stay away from LaCrosse atomic clocks!"
1,Keeps on recalibrating...,"I am tired of this clock...really. I thought it looked very clean and smart and the fact that it uses a radio signal meant not having to adjust it. But I have no idea why it starts to adjust every day at a random time. And then it just wouldn't stop for at least 2 hours. And of course, the clock is completely useless when it's just going round and round.Looks good as long as it doesn't have any batteries I suppose! I don't think I would buy into this whole radio controlled signal idea again."
2,It can not be used as a clock..,We brought this clock 6 months ago. First few months it worked properly. After the new DST time changes it got confused and doesn't show right time. After that it doesn't serve the purpose of a clock.
2,Not good any more,"The problem is that the clock has dayime saving dates hardcoded and not automatically reads from the radio waves. After the change in 2008 by US govt, this clock is totally useless.."
3,Defective Clock,"The radio controlled clock is a great idea. Unfortunately this one had a defect. I tried to contact Customer Service at LaCrosse by both email and telephone. There was no response from them.Finally, I gave up and called Amazon. They were terrific. They paid for the return of the clock to Amazon and they shipped out a replacement clock immediately at Amazon's expense. I couldn't ask for better service from Amazon. However, LaCosse's lack of any response is disappointing."
1,Horrible!,"I'll get right to the point. Do not purchase this clock! It does not set the correct time by itself, and these is no way to manually set the time. Mine is now in a landfill. I've never written a review for any other product, but this is SO BAD, I felt it necessary to warn others!"
1,Stopped working after 10 months,"It worked ok for 10 months and then just stopped. A new battery did not help. The hand movement is quite loud (when it worked), not recommended for a bedroom or other quiet area. It would be less expensive to buy a higher quality unit to begin with than having to replace one of these every 10 months."
1,The Worst clock I ever owned,Second needle doesn't workkeep on resetting time every day to an unknown time zone.not even worh to try.
4,La Crosse Tech. Analog Watch,"Pros: Nice design, Number readable between 10ft, perfect in my kitchenCons: Did not detect the signal but I will try it to install in the evening but you can set the time manually.Tips: Read the manual first before operating or before you decide to return the product. you have to follow the manual."
5,La Crosse WET-310 Atomic ClockVery good,"Very good addition to my wall, easy to set, keeps accurate time. I highly reccomend this clock if you need a low cost and accurate clock."
1,six broken clocks. Don't buy!!!!,"I ordered three of these clocks. Not a single one worked from day one. I shipped all three back. They gave me three more. Now, after five years none of these work. DON'T BUY ONE OF THESE CLOCKS! This company shouldn't be in business."
1,not a good buy,I bought this clock for my guest house. I went out to see if everything was okay and found the hands of the clock going around and around. I took it outside and that stopped. But now the second hand doesn't work. I put a new battery in it but that didn't matter. It was working fine for five months from when I bought it. I am very disappointed with it and will not buy another.
2,Mostly perfectly accurate,"If you buy an atomic clock, it's probably because you want it to be accurate. I bought one of these, and mostly it's accurate. Sometimes though it just loses its mind...right now it's 45 minutes off.I have a Casio wristwatch and it's ALWAYS PERFECT. Am I spoiled? I want the clock to work right so we'll all know what time it is...not what it probably is."
4,"Great clock, no problems","Reading the other reviews here, I hesitated to buy this clock. But my experience with another La Crosse atomic clock (that I still own) has been so positive that I decided to chance it. I'm glad I did. This new clock is working perfectly, just like my other. Yes, it took a day for it to sort itself out--don't expect it to jump to the correct time instantly. The thing needs to get its bearings. But a little patience will be rewarded. Once it gets the right time, it gets exactly the right time and keeps it day in and day out."
1,Does Not Work!!!,"I purchased 6 of these clocks for my business. They absolutely do not work. I tried sending a couple back, but had the same problems with the replacement clocks. They can't seem to set themselves. The hands just spin around and never seem to land on the actual time. I tried taking them near a window to set themselves, thinking maybe they just couldn't get a clear signal -- but that didn't work. They were a huge waste of money and time. Now, I'm back to my good old fashioned, reliable clocks."
3,"Just as described, it works",The box contained very simple easy instructions to set the time manually. We hung it up and overnight the atomic feature worked to set the exact time. I'm happy with the operation and recommend it.
1,Clock Does Not Work With The New Daylight Saving Time Rules,"I purchased this clock which is advertised as Model # WT-3102B. The clock that I received is Model # WT-3102. I do not know what the difference is between the two model numbers but my clock does not work properly with the new daylight saving time rules. I tried to call LaCrosse technical support and the line has been busy for several days. When I finally got through the most you can do is leave a message in voice mail for them to call you back and they have not called me back. Although LaCrosse advetises that all of their clocks are compatible with the new daylight saving time rules, this clock is not. Based on this and the lack of technical support I cannot recommend this clock."
1,Red Sticker on Back == Broken DST,"I bought 4 of these recently, and found that while they picked up the timing signal perfectly from WWVB in Ft. Collins, CO, they did NOT 'spring forward' for DST. Since the DST indicator bit is part of the time-code signal, this was very confusing. I just got off the phone with LaCrosse technical support, and they acknowledged that this is a known-issue (just confirmed in the last couple days), and the WWVB receiver IC used in any of the movements with a red sticker on the back IGNORES the DST bit sent on WWVB (and uses the pre-2007 DST date algorithm instead.) LaCrosse is taking names and numbers and will supposedly be contacting everyone in late April with instruction on how to exchange the product for a working one."
3,GARBAGE,1ST OFF THIS CD IS ALL OLD MATERIAL FROM 1992-1997.THATS WHACK & DR DRE ISNT EVEN IN ALL THE SONGS!!!THATS GARBAGE.DR DRE'S LYRICS WERENT EVEN ALL THAT.SO THIS CD IS A WASTE.SOME OFF THE SONGS ARE GOOD THOUGH.
5,creme de la creme of recent mystery crop,no gimmickry herre--just good characterization and the best voice in private eyes since Parker...
1,awful,This book is awful.I'm assuming the other reviewers have written positive things because they agree with Mr. Simon's political views.This book should come with the following warning: May cause drowsiness.
2,Sticky,Very good quality however I have a problem with food sticking to the pan. I've used butter and oil but have had the same results. I haven't cooked anything savory in it yet so the problem may only be when cooking sweet items.
3,Pricey,There are other aebleskiver pans on the market that can probably do just a capable job as this more pricey pan with limited use. One pays extra for the Pro-Logic finish which wears off in time anyway. It would have been a nicer touch if Lodge included a few recipes to help us to start off with. IMHO I would recommend buying one of the less expensive pans unless you plan on making pancake balls quite often.
1,YUK!!,"It is NOT non-stick and the wells are too deep. Made several batches trying to work with this thing, but to no avail. They were YUK!! It's going back pronto!! Yuk!"
1,"Product features mentioned false, It is not nonstick",I bought this item online for $31.99. It is stated in Product features that it is nonstick item. But it is not.I am very unhappy.Item is not at all worth of price quoted.I am returning this item. I am calling amazon how to return this item?
5,Aebleskiver Pan,I am very pleased with the performance of this lodge pro logic cast-iron Aebleskiver pan. It is seasoned cast-iron so I never need to worry about peeling silver stone or non-stick finish coming off. The Aebleskiver pan is easy to use and the results were enjoyed by everyone. Great product.
5,Versatile little pan,"Great pan for pancake puffs, corn dog bites, brownie bites, you name it! Fun to make and fun to eat. It does take some time to complete a ""batch"", but keep a plate warm and it's well worth it. I prefer turning with a spoon (much easier), and make sure the pan is pretty hot before putting the batter into it."
5,Double duty,"This Aebleskiver pan does double duty in our house. First, of course, it does wonderful aebleskivers. However, I do not make them all of the time but I do make muffins quite often so the pan also serves as a little muffin pan. The pan will hold one package of muffin mix like a Martha White and it will get you seven nice little golden-crusted muffins. My son calls what comes out ""cute little mushroom muffins."" I am tempted to get a real cast-iron muffin pan because this one does so well."
4,Aebleskiver pan,This is a fine sturdy pan. The instructions weren't really clear - I didn't know if I was supposed to use it in an oven or on a stove top. A tried a couple recipes and then settled on a recipe for baked donuts made on the stove top. A couple weeks after I purchased this through Amazon it was featured for half price (a special) at one of the upscale kitchen/dishes/glassware/condiments stores and websites.
5,Lovely pan,"I had never heard of this type of pan before, and a Gold Box deal sparked my interest. After reading all the reviews, I elected to purchase the Lodge Pro-Logic model. The pan is well seasoned, and works impressively well. My kids and family were fascinated by the idea of round pancake balls. I used the Krusteaz mix recipe submitted by another reviewer. The first batch was a learning experience, but subsequent batches turned out perfect-brown and crispy on the outside, sweet and moist on the inside. Thanks for the new experience, Amazon!"
5,Another Hit from Paragon,"As usual the Paragon Ragtime orchestra has another hit. Wonderful Performance and very informative notes. My only didssapointment was that the Joplin pieces were period style arrangements by Rick Benjamin. Nevertheless, this is a wonderfully enjoyable album."
3,Nice Artwork,"Nice artwork, as expected from Mr. Ware, but this time, the contents are not on the level! The liner notes explain the lack of orchestration skills surfacing regularly at those times, but is that a reason to play less carefully than on the other PRO recordings (the REALLY outstanding ""More Candy"" and ""Black Manhattan"", for example)? Especially the pretty rough drums playing is an annoying setback, compared to the fine balance those mucicians achieve in their other recordings. Still probably the best rendering possible of that music, I think..."
5,Very good stuff.,This is a very good album. there isn't a single boring song on the album. the band has added a second guitarist for this album and it sounds damn good. The interplay between the two guitars is absolutly wondefull. I normally dont like saxophone in anything other than jazz but it works very well here. get this album and listen to it loud.

5,Flawless and Timeless,"This is a timeless piece, a flawless production, and a message to all on the issue of discrimination and how to fight it."
5,David Leans re-creates the British Raj,"David Lean is the ultimate Zen Master, when it comes to making movies on a grand scale. Though this is not ""Lawrence of Arabia"" or ""Bridge on the River Kwai"", ""Passage to India"" is a must have movie to complete the David Lean collection. The film moves slowly, in keeping with the period, but transforms you to the time of the British Raj, to relive a turning point in colonial history. Acting, cinematography, editing and direction are top notch."
3,Kind of stupid,"big long dramatic movie... like, i don't get why she did that. big drama over nothing. but I watched whole movie."
2,A passage to deep sleep.,"Perhaps I expected more than a simple depiction of colonial oppression and a seemingly contrived plot intended to draw immediate sympathy to someone wrongly accused or a horrendous crime.It began with obvious caricatures of wealthy English oppressors and postcard like glimpses of a fascinating culture yet managed to hold my interest for about 40 minutes.Ultimately, the lack of complex characters and social situations proved the film could be little more than an attempt to manipulate the emotions of those who require despicable villains, innocent victims and self-righteous heros to provide them with good old fashion entertainment and easily consumed moral lessons.For those who desire thought provoking images of foreign cultures and a deeper exploration into the nature of human oppression, this film is insignificant."
3,Not as good as I'd hoped,"The movie started out very promisingly, with a lot of visuals of India and the look and feel of the 1920s, but it all just kind of goes around in circles after it gets all the characters in place. I still don't get the whole thing with the caves. Was something supernatural supposed to have happened? Is this what led to accusations and a trial? The movie fails to make it as ""trial classic"" as well as it scarcely delves into the proceedings before it is all over. Speaking of all over, I found myself wondering when the movie was going to be done. And when it was done I found myself wondering what, exactly, happened.Maybe if you read the book first it makes more sense."
2,kinda good kinda boring,I have to remember it was made in 1980's. It was too long of a movie and it took too long to get interesting
1,A Passage to Boredom,"This is a film based on a book written by an author dedicated to boring you senseless. The film drags and has no appreciable moments and the acting is quite forgettable. This is the sort of ""sophisticated"" film that ends with you sitting in your car cursing the person who conned you into wasting 2 excruciatingly painful hours filled with you listening to people munch on stale popcorn.Don't read the book and don't see the film. Actually, if you rent the film, only do so as part of some cruel hoax on the person you're planning to torture with it. Certainly don't waste your time watching this alone.As proof of my criticism of this waste of time, how many times can you say that this film as been shown on TV? Yes, I can only remember it being on once back many years ago. So there you have it."
3,Entertaining but...,I had never seen this movie before believe it or not. Beautiful on site photography- interesting story that bring to light class and racial problems of the period. Somehow the story just doesn't grab you. One expects more form David Lean. Overall entertaining but not memorable.
4,Even the British are ashamed of their behavior?,"This movie is sort of an IndianTo Kill a Mockingbird (2-Disc Slimcase Set) [DVD] with a twist.A journey to the caves becomes a disaster in which a well respected and educated Indian ( Islamic) doctor is accused of rape.You get an impression that the English gentleman in this movie are mostly very bigoted fools? On would like to believe that the British have grown out of being be-knighted snobs with the heads in an impossible place,but after seeing a British version of Oklahoma lately,I still rather doubt it? If we should see a Bernard Shaw revival, then we might have some hope."
5,A MUST for Future Trance fans!,"This is one of the best Future Tranc (Progressive) tracks of all time.A True classic. With the exception of the SQ1 remix, the remixes are trash. But no matter, the radio and original of Why Dont U Dance With Me MORE THAN make up for it. This song set the standard for the Progressive Sound. A Must have!"
2,Don't do it again,"Sorry the CD is so poor and it's not due to the artists present but to the overall direction/production and also the weak interpretation of most the songs. Never have I so quickly returned a CD, and it would of been quicker if I had not found some consolation in the magical ""Povo"". This is an excellent track that inspired me to buy the Mr Hubbards ""Red Clay""I may be sounding like a music snob, but hey, I do like my smooth stuff as well, But this is just dull. I think somebody in the collaboration thought so to, thats why the stuck in PovoM"
1,I want my money back!,"I am so disapointed! This album is boring. It's a bunch of warmed over cover tunes, that aren't done very well. When I say they aren't done very well, I mean artistically. They are very well executed by an all star band, but there is nothing new here. There are only a couple of songs worth listening to, Brown Sugar and Povo. One thing that does stand out is Christian McBride's bass playing, Especially on Povo. Technically, the mix is uninspiring. It's a little sad for me to see such artistic giants come up so short. For the record I love Stormin Norman, Rick Braun, and Kirk. If you want some great music purchase either one of their latest albums, you won't be disapointed or better yet get Fourplay's Heartfelt, it's totally OFF the HOOK!"
1,I want my money back part II,"Couldn't agree more with a previous reviewer. These guys are great and I love their music, but, this thing just did not work. I keep trying to like it, given the artists that are playing, but just can't. Take a look at the number of used for sale and their price, lots of people are unloading it. In this case, the ""whole"" did not equal the ""parts""."
4,"Oh, HELL yeah!","Sleepy funk; sound like an oxymoron? It's not. This set is chock-a-block with easy but greasy jazz/funk. The music definitely has a ""harder edge"" than the usual product from Rick Braun, Kirk Walum or Norman Brown. And considering that sidemen Christian McBride and Gregory Hutchinson are generally considered to be more ""traditional"" jazz musicians, they cook up some really nasty grooves. Good CD."
4,The Perfect Pet,"For someone who wants a perfect pet without all the work, this is the way to go. It's cute and realistic."
5,So Adorable!!!!,"So adorable!!!! Purchased this for my mom as a ""companion"" since all of her friends have dogs. She didn't want one but now has this cutie to show off. She loves it."
5,Probably The Best Walkman Ever Made,"As the title states, in my opinion, this is the best portable CD player ever made, let alone Walkman made. Sony really just about made the perfect CD player with this unit. Sound quality, build quality, everything is top notch, it also has a line out port. I can't recommend this unit enough, again probably the best Walkman Sony will ever make."
1,Is Unbelieve,"Is the worst cd player that I've ever used, the sound is bad and the volume control don't have enough balance, and the FM tuner is very noisy, really, all the walkman is very noisy, You must to use the line-out to hear it without noise, Please don't buy"
5,Indie/Punk/New Wave,"The Beat Strings re an up and coming Iowa Band, dont let that turn you off because they are amazing and this album sounds great, highligts ""starlight"" ""make me a message"" ""before the light"" and ""osiris"" Defintily worth checking out if you like messy punk (not butt punk) new wave dancey hooks, and i'm pretty sure you guys do."
4,What a ride!,"Somewhere in our hearts we each know that something more exists - some path that, once found, will explain, will exhilarate and will heal. Denie's journey takes you there. Journey to Truth irrevocably alters your life. It all becomes clear. A new kind of good is how you'll feel."
4,"It sounds so cliche, but I couldn't put this book down.","You could call me the world's biggest skeptic. However this book got to me and changed my perceptions completely. Reading about what he went through, made me think that my path is a peice of cake. His struggles showed how much of a pain in the ___ we can be to ourselves. He had to be hit over the head a few times before he got the message that his spirit was sending him signals. I don't think I want to have to go through that. Thanks for the message."
4,Some pretty cool stuff.,"A friend gave me a copy and at first I thought - just another health book. Then I started to read it, I realized it has heaps of really good information in it that everyone should know. And this is coming from a sceptic. All in all a good book!"
5,Mandalas; Luminous Symbols for Healing,We used this with children in lessons on ways to call ourselves into worship or prayer. We also studied some of Hildegard of Bingen's Mandala art.
5,Excellent,Thanks for a very quick delivery of a beautiful book. The condition is better than expected. Terrific service.
5,Excellent and Beautiful...,This is one of the most comprehensive and beautiful mandala books I have come across. Well above many of the other mandala books on the market. Anyone can enjoy and gain from this book.
2,"Beautiful book, but not useful to me","This book has many beautiful and stunning pictures (just like any other ""coffee-table"" book), but it is not useful to me personally, as I do not like working on black art paper, and every design is to be done on black art paper. If you enjoy working with black art paper, then you will probably enjoy using this book.Also, as expected in a ""healing"" book, there are strong religious undertones through-out the book.I would recommend that you spend a few minutes studying a copy of this book at your local library or bookstore before buying."
5,Wonderfully inspiring!,This is a great book on many levels.The other reviewers have done such a good job that I'll just leave it at that.I will buy copies for friends. A perfect gift.
5,Purrfect,"Beanie Babies don't get much cuter than this--pink, sweet, and adorable. A nice addition to our collection, to which we have added several cats."
4,Sunny,"I first listened to this CD in my mom's car...she never likes music very loud, so I was listening to it softly. DON'T do this. It was bland, uninteresting, and I regretted buying it. However, I got home, and put it into my bedroom CD player, and turned the volume up high...Wow! It was suddenly toe-tapping and swingy, and the melodies were sheer perfection (I love those raggy tunes).My only complaint is the lack of stringed instruments like banjos (albeit not widespread in the repertoire/style for part of the target period) as a good grounding for the airiness of the winds, which seemed to be lacking in places. It's also great percussion, and drums just don't always do the trick.But anyways, my advice is: turn the volume up--don't even listen to it on headphones--and lose yourself. A delight. :)"
5,Perfect match,Perfect match to the old ones. You can not tell which are old and which were replaced. Would buy again.
5,The author name is wrong. It is Martinson. Please correct,please note wrong author. It is Martinson. Please correct
4,Used in High School Classroom,I used this book in my (French 1)classroom for the first few weeks. The kids liked it because the exercises were easy. It gave them confidence in the language so that they could see YOU CAN LEARN A SECOND LANGUAGE!!!
2,"Probably a good book, but useless on Kindle",Some good books are best in hardcopy format. This is one; you need to refer from one page to another in a way that kindle does not easily support. Also: many diagrams are not easily understood or viewed in a Kindle screen.
3,Good on vocab and grammar but nothing on pronunciation,I bought this as one of two textbooks required for a beginner's French class. This is my first ever French class. I have been using the book for about 6 weeks. This book does a good job of teaching French vocabulary and grammar. If all you are looking for is the ability to read and understand simple French writings - then this book is a good fit for you. But there is absolutely nothing in this book on pronunciation. The only reason I am OK is that my French teacher has made a CD for this textbook which she has distributed where she reads the lessons and instructs on French pronunciation. By the way - my first impression of French pronunciation is that it is most definitely not obvious and intuitive. You need someone with you to explain and instruct you on the rules of pronunciation.
2,Sounded pretty good in 1999,"Some of the cuts on this CD were almost hypnotic when I first heard them nearly 10 years ago. But what do I know; if I had to guess I would say that 10 years further on this will be a collectors item and very hard to find, either in shops or on Amazon"
3,Not As Informative As It Could Be.,"There are really only a few floor plans in this book, and they really aren't any different than the standard RV floorplan. I expected to see many plans of different ways to convert a bus, with storage and size restrictions highlighted. There is some useful information in this book, but it is the same info also available in the ""Select and Convert Your Bus into a Motorhome"" guide."
5,Fantastic!,Totally fearless! I thought IA had retired. This is as good a performance of hers as I've seen. A difficult subject.(I think the shot(s?) at the end are somewhat improbable.)
4,Handy for Home Office,I purchased this copier 2 months ago. Setup and operation instructions very clear and easy to follow including installing the toner cartridge. Copies very clear and sharp. No dark edges on copies as I have experienced on another copier (Sharp). Copies come out smooth with no curls and are straight. I mainly use the copier for small quantities. Only problem I encountered was a paper jam when making 40 copies of 10 pages. This I think could be avoided if I had fanned the copier paper before loading. I have been using letter paper with 84 brightness with better than average quality. Copier is fairly quiet. It is a very handy tool and very convenient for immediate copies at home. I did not rate the copier a 5 star because I want to see how reliable it will be over time.
2,I would buy something else,"My office recently purchased this copy machine. After 2 months of use the paper started to jam every other copy. When I called for service I got a HUGE run around and finally took it back to the store where it was purchased. They helped me figure out the problem and showed me how to ""fix"" it. It is a very temporary solution and I have to ""fix"" it every 3rd time I use the copier. For the money I spent, I would buy something else!"
2,"Skip this, get Crush","I bought this book early in the year hoping to use it over the course of several months as a very basic review. With Step 2 only 2 months away I've finally decided to cut my losses and get Crush the Boards. Pharmacology is particularly weak, the text is too basic and too much space and energy is wasted on their little icons for diagnostics, prevention, etc. If you're only going to buy one book, this is not it."
1,Could Not Be Worse,"What an accomplishment: a sequel so bad it makes me regret having seen the original! The script is incoherent. Actors who were quite good in ""Coming Home"" - especially Patrick Ryecart and Joanna Lumley - are left to random plot points and dialogue so horrible that they seem mystified while reciting it - I hope they were well paid! The character of Judith Dunbar - central to ""Coming Home"" - is relegated to the sidelines, and Emily Mortimer has been replaced with a charmless actress who spends her little screen time whining. The plot involving Jess is completely unrealistic, as is the notion that Judith would sell the Dower House (which has disappeared in Nancherorow). And the scriptwriters seem to have forgotten that Judith was left independently wealthy in ""Coming Home"". As to Gus going from impoverished artist to savior of Nancherrow by virtue of a single New York art show....please. Don't waste your money, especially as this is a rather pricey DVD."
4,Good product shipped super fast!,"I ordered on 17th in the late afternoon, hitch shipped the following day the 18th and arrived in Florida on my doorstep on the 19th. Can't beat that delivery speed :)Good all round. And the doughnut 16"" spare fits fine with this hitch.Note that this hitch is the exact same as the U-Haul Class 3 hitch for the Astro!!!Had to file one of the holes in the hitch a little to make it fit. Otherwise easy job."
5,A wonderful look at complex human/environmental interaction,"This small paperback offers a surprisingly detailed look at the history behind the creation of the Quabbin Reservior, created in the 1930s in Western Massachusetts to supply Boston with drinking water. It also takes a look at the state of the reservoir today, which has become an oasis of carefully-managed wilderness in the midst of thickly-settled central New England. Despite a subject that could lead a writer to academia-inspired pedantry, it has an almost storybook quality that makes it as pleasurable to read as it is informative. For anyone interested in a WPA-era tale of a massive, government-sponsored public works project, or with an interest in the politics of environmental preservation and manipulation, it's a good investment."
4,"For once, the unintended consequences were good!","Enchanting, illustrated account of the flooding of the Swift River Valley in Eastern Connecticut in 1939, to create the Quabbin Reservoir which serves Boston and surrounding areas. Covers the history of the towns that were removed, the engineering efforts to create a satisfactory water bed and the unintended consequences of the project. Fifty years later, the area around the reservoir had become an almost primeval wilderness, home to the American eagle and other endangered birds, and all the wealth of flora and fauna that had flourished there long before the first settlers arrived."
5,sturdy cart,"This is a nice solid cart with steel axles and metal rims that should last. It is simple to assemble and folds up very easy. The basket is about the right size and is big enough for most chores. The unit, when upacked, had a very strong odor that smelled like creosote, but after putting it outside to air out it went away."
4,worth the money,"Not bad for the cost. Only complaint is the led light is so bright,that it is blinding when using at night"
1,Broke immediately,"Before this even reached the car, we plugged it into the phone to make sure it fit. It did--but the prongs broke when being pulled back out (gently). My advice is to spend a few extra dollars and buy the Sony-Ericsson charger! We did, and it's much sturdier."
2,"Nice Idea, but poor qulity","It was very great...loved the retactable cord, but I was only able to use it twice before it broke. The little prongs that hold the charger into the phone snapped off when I took my phone off the charger."
5,This is amazing...,"So that's what all the fuss is about! This is about perfect. It's quite a bit different than their later works, but Digweed and Sasha find perfect harmony here. What a mix. It's just really, really good.And I finally got the second disc. It's not really necessary because the first disc is just that good. But the second disc just takes you a bit further. It's much more intense and is not as transcendent but it's wonderfully moody.This is definitely worth the hype. Hard to believe it's going on ten years. There's still nothing quite like it out there.My only bother would be that you gotta pay out the nose to get the second disc (issued, apparently, everywhere but in the U.S.). Why isn't it available in the states?"
3,"Listeneable, and good but, falls short of other Sasha/Dig..","I basically like it and some of it at times is pretty darn good but, compare it to the other Northern Exposure series or the Global Sydney CD, I think this is considerably weaker. I won't go so far as to say I wish I had not bought it but, it will probably not see as much play times as the others... Your mileage may vary..."
3,Remember this is not the full album,"An all time favourite, but remember that this is not the version you know and love.It is a single disc. Have to check the track listing, but I believe it is just the second disc rather than a thoughtful compilation from the two discs.Note, I love the album, so three stars for half of it isn't bad."
2,not as good as they say,"i started listening to techno in 93' when i was introduced to the club scene. not too long after that i bought my first cd, renaissance with dave seaman and ian ossia. how fortunate for me. anyway, throughout the years i've listened to all types of techno music, including sasha and john digweed. in these reviews people have stated that this cd is an instant classic, or a flawless mix. now i don't want to discredit sasha and john digweed, but this is not their best mix. it's good, but not great, it's a solid mix, but not flawless, it's a classic, but not one that i would continually listen to. it's too out of date. the sounds are too old and the structure is too outdated. in my opinion, and it's a seasoned expert opinion, look for something a little newer, a little more modern, you'll be happier with the sounds, and leave the classics to the symphony."
2,GOOD MUSIC + UGLY RECORDING = FAILURE,"The music is very good and I would give it 5 enthusiastic stars. However, the cheapest recording imaginable ruins the CD - it hisses and crackles like dusty vinyl. Hard to believe in the digital era you still can find a recording THAT BAD."
1,Could this be Magic?,"I can't believe it has already been six years since the release of this album and that, having bought a few hundered Trance cd's since, this still holds the number one spot in my collection. Everything in my collection seems to move out from this series, and nothing seems to have outdone the sheer magic of this first. If you like to go to those secret places in your mind, grab this one up. It is beautiful, haunting, lively and lovely...and what a build up to the last cut! It is a mystical journey that leads to one final explosion of musical joy. I have never tired of this cd and have frequently given it as a gift...just for the joy of buying it again."
4,good n slow,"I fully expected this CD to be an electronic all-out techno/trance album, but was somewhat pleasantly surprised to find out that it was much at a slower pace than I was expecting. The music is high quality, with lots of ambient touches. I especially liked the last two tracks, also probably the hardest in the bunch. A good album for when you want to listen to techno, but need a break from the monotiny of the 4 on the floor beat."
2,Wrong Northern Exposure,"Sorry, folks, but I bought the wrong CD. I was trying to get a recording of the various instrumentals which played on the TV program ""Northern Exposure"", but I was unable to get any info from the credits. So I inquired of Amazon and naturally they came up with this CD. Since I was seeking those wonderfully exotic native chants and especially fine instrumentals which played while they displayed spectacular film of the aurora borealis, I was naturally disappointed when this was not the music I expected - but that is not the fault of the artists! Nor is it their fault that my taste found the music from the first CD to the second one indistinguishable. Sorry, but it just sounded like more of the same! P. S. If you know who the artists are who contributed to the TV show Northern Exposure, please email the info to me at ""westby@tgarden.com"" Thanks!"
5,Best album ever?,"If you like trance then this is it. Nobody has ever topped the artistic prowess of Sasha and Digweed. The sounds are amazing, trancendent and wistfull. Just pop in the CD, close your eyes, and get ready to be tranceported to another world. This is just one of those albums where you can sit down and listen to the entire thing without stopping, doing otherwise would be a shame."
5,Truly Listen,"Wow,!!!One word that comes to mind when I think about this CD. One word of advice though; truly listen to this album. I remember when I first got it, I was expecting something very different--I was expecting hardthumping, body moving trance--DJ Tiesto style, but this album doesn't come close to that. It's much deeper, with layers and layers of notes which you can only pick up if you really listen. Essentially, it's a chillout, headbobbing,thinking, emotional album that is mixed with such precision that you will not be able to tell when the songs go from 1-3. It just happens. The tracklisting is phenomenal, and when the album weaves its way around to the last 2 tracks, you will feel like dancing/ images of dancing on a beach/forest/the moon will appear in your head, and you will be extremely happy that you bought this abum."
5,Sasha and Digweed never disappoint,Sasha and Digweed never disappoint me..always consistent with awesome sound and technique..this cd is great for every mood
4,Old school Sasha and Digweed is still fresh,Electronic music sure has come a long way since this album but the Northern Exposure series still holds some luster. A trademark Sasha and Digweed trait is superb mixing and this disk even though prodced in 97 shows some roots of two of the hottest DJ's in the world. I have owned this disk for a while but if you wanna get some old school tracks and remember where it all came from pick this up.
5,The Best Journey any music can bring.....,No doubt one of the best compilation of all time.....Digweed/Sasha mix this album with atmospheric ambient and dancy trance in such remarkable style....enjoy your trip thru the epic house style of the two most amazing dj in the world
5,and the magic begins.....,Anyone wishing to become familiar with Sasha & John Digweed must make this CD your next purchase. This is the CD that kicked off probably the best series in electronic music. S&D's Northern Exposure series is a treasure-trove of beutiful melodies and FANTASTIC mixes. This episode of NE is slightly different from most of the others in that it focuses on the more gentle breakbeat sounds than on straight trance beats. The CD opens with what sounds like Eric Idle from Monty Python giving a little speech. The fabulous guitar melody then filters in over spacey background sounds. The soft breaks pick up in track 2 and carry on trough the WONDERFUL tracks 3 and 4 until a great journey mix brings in track 5. This track has samples of Tori Amos' Blue Skies. Every track is a standout. Buy it!
5,Brilliant as always...,"S & D are the Gods of electronic music. Together they compliment each other. This is the earliest N.E. cd. There are 4 discs totally (not counting the expedition cds.) My favorite are North and East. South and West are more mainstream. However, no matter which one is better, any of these cds will always outrank those anthem compilations (yeah, with the word 'trance' on it in font size 48). These albums are definitely not cheese, and yet classic. Buy them now! Hopefully you still can find the South disc (import version, which is out of print). Good Luck!"
5,This is soooo good,"I'll make this short. I have owned this CD for a few years and listened to it again just the other day. This album is soooo good - I had to take a moment and recommend it. My favorite track has to be ""I'm Free"" - but the rest are all just fantastic. HIGHLY recommend this album - it stands the test of time. Wonderful ambient tones with heavy low bass takes advantage of a full spectrum of sound. The other Exposure albums are also very good."
1,Probably not your best bet,"Although the title seems promising, the actual text is a little wanting. Vacillating between ""I was there"" interviews and relying upon sources like Kenneth Rexroth (who although a fine poet had a Bunyan-sized axe to grind against the Beats), there's lots there that doesn't seem to ring true, and more than a little hero-worship (Michael McClure as ""half a Hell's Angel"" because he owned a Triumph? I'm not buying it). But, if, like me, you've read every other portrayal of the Beats this one can't hurt you, I'm also convinced it won't help you...."
2,Kokoro,"I love the scent of plumeria, and thought this product might be just like fresh plumeria flowers. It is not. I'm sure they tried very hard to capture the essence of plumeria, but this isn't it. :( On an up-note, it did come in a pretty bottle, and I received it quickly."
5,This is what a plumeria smells like!,"Just got it today. Finally a plumeria perfume that smells just like the fresh picked flower! I smelled every plumeria perfume I have come across at home and Hawaii and not one came close. This is the one to buy! Wow everytime I smell it I go back to Hawaii,as I'm picking up that freshly fallen flower and smelling that wonderful scent!"
2,Doesn't last,"When I put it on, it doesn't last more than 10 minutes. Not a good quality. I am using it at night when I sleep, it isn't good enough to wear when going out."
2,Don't waste your money.... or your time.,"This book has some value, hence 2 stars not one. But slogging through student essays on how quarks date (really!)is insufferable.Get Gordan Kane's ""The Particle Garden"" and get more."
5,"As good as anything by Jem, Jewel or Nelly Furtado","Catchy pop laced with world-music flourishes and folk, Robin's voice is powerful and sensuous, her songs uplifting and unforgettable. Eye of the Storm is a fabulous track, poppy without feeling mass produced. The opener, Follow, is just as good as anything by Jem, Jewel or Nelly Furtado! And I'm crazy about Little Stars, a deceptively simple song about family, and how a full house can bring about a full heart. Endearing. Check out Robin in her two (!) other bands, Folk-Pop marvel Imaginary Friends (with the CDs ""Fragile Illusion"" and ""What If"") and the all-girl quintet, Drawing Down the Moon, whose Goddess-Rock CD ""Angel in My Dream"" includes the founder of the 80's glam band Vixen!"
5,erin mckeown,"Amazing, amazing musician- Erin has lyrics, music, and charm like no one else! Buy it- you won't regret it."
3,good light,"the light works well if you keep it within 2 or 3 inches of the plant. Place it right abouve soil for sprouts, and keep raising it as they grow. Eventually, if you have a decent sized garden, you will wantHydroFarm FLT48 Commercial System Grow Light Fixturebut these are good to get it going."
3,The Trillogy comes to a Close,"In this final book of the 'To The Stars' trillogy Jan joins up in the revoloution which is sweeping across the stars to free the world of the tyrrany which is in power.It went out with more of a fizzle than a bang though. Events happen too easily, and there is little in the way of charachter development. The protoganist, Jan, while someone who can take what is given to him and do something with it, spends most of this book riding the waves of what is set in front of him rather than forging his own path. In the end, I felt anyone could have had the parts he had and things turn out the same. The entire trillogy was too short, and relied more in events out of the charachters controll to move the storyline along. I think it could have been a lot better with more charachter development.Dispite these criticisms, it was a good story. And, most trillogies tend to fizzle in the second and last books anyway."
5,ASterix in Paris!,"This is one of my favourite Asterix books.Asterix and the Golden Sickle was first published in French in 1962 and in English in 1975.Asterix and Obelix journey to Lutetia (Ancient Paris) to buy a desperately needed Golden Sickle for the Druid Getafix.On the way there they easily deal with the mobs of bandits that attack them on the road , and also cannot find lodgings at Sundinium (Ancient Le Mans )because they are there during the great-Ox-Cart race -The Sundinium 24 hours.When they get to Lutetia they find that finding a sickle will not be so easy and that Obelix's cousin , the great sickle maker Metallurgix is missing .To get to the bottom of this they must battle against the Lutetia underworld as well as the Roman authorities (and make a journey through the forest that will later become the Bois de Boulogne).I wont spoil the ending but we all know that every Asterix adventure ends with a feat under the starry sky to welcome our heroes back to the village."
5,Pleased,"I remember reading this book with my stepson, then age nine, and thoroughly enjoying the amusing names and wily ways of the Gauls as they overcame the Romans. It was a joy to once again be able to read these Asterix books with my grandson, now age nine. I would recommend these comic books to children of nine to ninety who would also enjoy amusing situations in which the little guys overcome the big guys, while at the same time learning a tiny amount of history."
3,Another amusing early Asterix tale.,"Rene Goscinny, Asterix and the Golden Sickle (Orion, 1962)Poor Getafix was, perhaps, Rene Goscinny's most hated character early on in the Asterix series; he has to have been, because in the series' early book, it always seems to be Getafix who's somehow gotten into dutch. This book is no exception; Getafix's golden sickle has broken, and Asterix and Obelix have to go get him a new one. This turns out to be, of course, far more trouble than expected, as the golden sickle maker (one of Obelix's distant cousins, as it turns out) has disappeared, and someone's running a black market in golden sickles...If you're familiar with Goscinny and Uderzo, you know what you're getting here; no big surprises, nothing more or less than you get from the rest of the series-- a good, fast-paced story with fine wordplay, good (if somewhat crude, and politically incorrect in today's society) humor, and lots of Legionnaires getting their behinds kicked. It's all in good fun. ***"
1,What Is Going on Here?,"By its cover, this book looks as though it would be a reprint of Joseph Fletcher's original 1966 book. Yet all the reviewers thus far extol some ""Montgomery"" person for countering Fletcher's thesis.But then the dishonesty of religious believers is utterly limitless.Do not buy this version. Seek out the original. It may not have been perfect, but it was a serious and respectable quest. I acquired my copy around 1970 from a Lutheran student aspiring to ministry. I do not know whether his class was reading it to learn, or merely to oppose."
4,"Morning, noon & night or anytime in between","This is my first Bob James CD since the Double Vision collaboration with David Sanborn. On a whim, I bought Morning Noon & Night as an add-on to my Spyro Gyra ""Original Cinema"" purchase to get the free shipping. Being a long-time Spyro Gyra fan makes it hard for me to admit that of the two CDs I ordered, Morning Noon & Night is my favorite. A very delightful and relaxing listening experience once you get past the opening track, Street Smart. Not that I didn't like Street Smart, it just takes a few times listening to it to gain a sense of appreciation for Bob James' mixture of Hip Hop electronics and urban jazz. After Street Smart you a rewarded with Just One Thing and the title track, Morning Noon & Night with some great sax by Dave Koz. Overall this is a really good CD that will have you listening to it over and over for hours. Buy it, you'll like it, even Street Smart after a few listens!"
2,no pay off,"The premise of this movie looked mildly interesting, but in fact what could have been a decent film was botched by it's attempts to bring a touch of seriousness to an otherwise humorous ""mockumentary"". I have seen well done films of this type, and this was anything but. The more the characters in this film portray the protagonist as a ""likeable, non-egotistical"" person the less the viewer believes he is, especially in light of the fact that Dirk Shafer wrote and directed this film. The movie leaves the viewer confused, bored and uninterested. It was not worth my attention, and is not even entertaining as a bad movie."
5,beautiful,"This is a really nice book, beautifully told. The sort of strange idea (a girl with superhuman hearing) is made very realistic, surprisingly realsitic. The writing is good without being showy. I recommend this book for book groups and general readers. I loved the ending."
5,A Must Read,"I could not put this book down once I picked it up! It is a story of a bright innocent child who is uplifting and sweet. I was immediately intrigued by this child and wanted to follow on her journey of betrayal, discovery, and ultimately unconditional family love. This is a story not only of an exceptional character but of relationships within families and neighborhoods- how things change, twist, and turn yet home is most important. The discoveries that the main character Ship makes in her world bring back the true rawness of life. The book will not only remind you of adolescence but also question your current views of neighbors and choices. I would definately recommend reading this book!"
4,Good deal,"Second Dakota clip watch I've owned. Love 'em. Bullet proof construction and long lasting battery. The red LED is very handy for finding keys, door locks, etc. in the dark. My only gripe is that it doesn't come with a lighted dial, but I'll forgive that oversight in light of all the positive features."
4,"Dakota Mini Clip Microlight, Blue Dial, Black Case by Dakota","Product shipped well. I found it to arrive in good condition. Orverall product is well made. I have it hanging on my jeans all day at work, bumping and rubbing against other objects and paint has not even started to chip off yet. I'm very impreseed with the quality & workmanship that went into this watch."
1,Disappointed,"This book wasn't what the title implies - it is not specifically about organizing your fabric or scraps. While it touches on the subject, it is mainly just another quilt book with projects. Wanted a book that would tell me how to handle the bits of fabric or give storage and organization ideas. There must be enough information out there for someone to fill a whole book with photos and tips on how how quilters store their stuff."
2,Also disappointed!,I agree with previous reviewers - title is misleading. I've seen much better coverage of how to organize your fabrics in books that don't claim to be on that subject! There are some nice patterns for scrap quilts but shame on publisher for not giving it a more accurate title. ADDITION: Look at the more recent reviews carefully! Someone was obviously padding the reviews with positive ones . . . most REAL purchasers who are not married to the author or otherwise have an invested interest don't like this book!!!
2,"OK, but the accompanying CD needs improvement","I bought this with excitement- the CD companion was a good selling point. However, I was unable to figure out a way to do a text search of the CD to match a topic of interest. Despite the fact it was published in 1999, many of the chapters appear dated. A web site, like that in the competing volume Neurology in Clinical Practice, would be helpful."
3,"Average Book, OK for undergraduates.","Recently I had opportunity to go through this book. It is a good attempt to build up clinical correlationship. For postgraduate students of Internal medicine as well as of neurology, more details are needed. Quality of Videos in CD is average. One would be happier if full text is voiced (audio/sound)in CD. I think if these things are taken care of, next edition will be more useful."
5,Looks great on the counter,Great appliance with a powerful motor. I chose the red one and it is very chic. Has done everything I asked it to including powdering dried herbs. Who knew? Worth the purchase price.
2,I can't hear you over the blender.....,"You need ear protection to use this blender. We make smoothies every morning and my dog heads out into the garage, through the doggie door, when this thing is flipped on. Granted it does a great job but it sounds like a wood working tool!If you are hard of hearing go ahead and purchase this blender."
1,Doesn't blend at top; second one to break within a year,"Its pretty - that's all it has going for it.- bought 1 - it broke within a year - it started leaking well before that- bought a second , motor died within 6 monthsit doesn't blend items at the top. Do stay away."
4,"A great blender, if you can get it on sale.","Reading the other waring blender reviews I can see that it is a topic of a very polarizing nature. Some people love the simplicity of the Waring while others curse it and swear by their Kitchenaids. After months of deliberation I finally pulled the trigger and ordered the PBB201, finding it refurbished for less than the price a new carafe. After making some cocktails and smoothies with it I was happy with the results. I found that if I used too much ice and form air pockets around the blades that a quick stir with the back of a wooden spoon gets it back to blending. This blender would have earned 5 stars but the regular retail price is way too high. If you can find it for half off I would recommend it."
2,Ended up returning it...,Main need was a blender that could handle frozen fruits and such to make smoothies. This blender failed to blend a moderate level of frozen fruits with milk and ice. Dissapointing. Returning it to find something that does a bit better...
5,Best blender ever,"After years using Amazon I feel compelled to write my first review. I've gone through two of the most expensive Kitchen Aid blenders in an attempt to recreate the blended drinks I get in coffee shops. They simply never worked right. I would always end up with big ice or fruit chunks that just wouldn't blend, but the longer I ran it to try to get those pieces, it just made the rest of the drink too watery. Anyway, finally I said enough and tossed those out. I did my research and bought this one. What can I say - after 15 seconds in this blender I had the best smoothie I've ever made on my first try! I wish I bought this years ago! And it wasn't nearly as loud as I feared after reading some of the other reviews. It looks great too. I couldn't be happier."
4,Great little blender for making drinks,"I've used this blender model for many years now. It does a great job pulverizing ice as it blends. The main con with this model is the noise during use - it is very loud. Cleanup is fast and easy. The stainless steel container keeps drinks chilled. After using this model weekly for several years, the motor did start to die. Since you can only ignore the sounds of a failing motor for so long I researched blenders before buying this model again with no regrets."
3,Not impressed...,It's very sharp looking - love the color - but it has a hard time with the ice in my smoothies and I keep having to add liquid to get it to blend. Once it gets going it does OK - but it puts way too much air in the smoothie (with the anticipated results) and it turns out tasteless and warm. I'm returning it.
2,Wish it worked a lot better,"This blender looks great. If I just wanted it for its looks, it would get five stars.Unfortunately I bought this blender to crush ice when making mixed drinks. It does a terrible job. If I let it run for two minutes on low, I still have big ice chunks. If I run it on high, then the bottom gets mixed and everything on the top just sticks. I've tried smoothies, margaritas, protein shakes. Nothing comes out right. Making thick shakes is impossible because the blades won't circulate the liquid.So if you like protein shakes that have big chunks of ice and are poorly mixed, get this blender. You'll love it.You will notice that Waring is making no effort to address customer concerns on the Amazon web site. Doesn't say much for their customer service."
1,Fell apart after little use,We used this blender a handful of times and it broke very easily while blending squash soup. The squash was so soft that it fell apart with little effort. I only filled the blender up 1/2 way. There is no reason that it should have broken. I will never purchase this brand again. I highly recommend that you look elsewhere.
1,dead already,It Was a great blender till it died Thanksgiving day. Used 6 times! Replaced Cuisinart that lasted 6 min.What now?
1,*****WARNING JUNK*******,"I thought this was going to be the perfect blender, was I ever wrong. I used this blender almost every day to make smoothies, and I did not over fill or do anything that would cause it to break but it did. I should have known that it was going to break down by the smell of the motor burning as it was being used. I would understand it not being able to handle the frozen fruit if it was over packed but I never over filled it once. I got two weeks of use from this blender and then it died. The only thing this blender has going for it is that it looks nice. If you want a blender that is not afraid to blend and make good smoothies buy the Ninja BL660."
4,Great for the price,Basic and simple. This is all you need. Bought this one to replace a more expensive Kitchen Aid blender that just quit working.
4,Waring Bar Blender,"Although the on/off button doesn't seem to be working, I decided to keep the blender and I use it by plugging and unplugging the cord. It took a little bit of practice, but now I'm very good at making frozen drinks and smoothies, etc. just the way I want them. It was worth it buying the more expensive, professional blender. I can make frozen cocktails, but make them with more healthful antioxidant juices and less alcohol than I might get in bar and also spend much less money than if I were out at a bar."
2,Disappointed - Blender jar seal leaking at 1 year + 1 week / Burning smell since day 1,"This is a review of the PBB25 -Waring PBB25 Professional Bar Blender, Black and Stainless Steel JarI use this to make smoothies 5-6 times a week. I use frozen fruit instead of ice. Last week (53 weeks after I purchased the blender) the blender jar started leaking on the underside, where it connects to the base.After I add the frozen fruit the motor whines (on high speed) and smells like it's burning. This has happened since day one. I'm not adding a lot of fruit, 1/4 of frozen blueberries and 4-6 frozen strawberries. This blender should be able to handle this. I don't expect this blender to last very long.I called Waring customer service today about the leak and got a recording that basically said ""We're busy and can't take your call. Leave a message and we'll call you back."" I'll post back after I hear from them.If you're looking to make smoothies on a regular basis I suggest you consider a different blender."
3,Awesome Blender BUT...,This is a great little blender BUT the sticker on the front is AWEFUL. It was so sticky and hard to remove that i ended up damaging the front with scratches trying to get it all off. what a shame. Terrible.
3,misleading product description & drippy spout,"I am disappointed in this purchase. We have gone through numerous blenders over the years, always because of the motor burning. We make a lot of blended drinks. This product description stated, ""powerful 350 watt motor"". After little research, I discovered that 350 watts wasn't actually very powerful. So far so good though, it's not having any trouble blending the drinks. The only problem so far is that it drips like crazy when you pour from it. If I were to do it over again, I would probably go with a different blender but we'll see how long this one lasts!"
4,Fantastic,Great blender! I use it daily to make smoothies and it never fails. Powerful motor purees frozen fruits great!! Simple--only two speeds. Easy clean-up.
4,not really retro green,"Blender is very nice and high quality. However, the retro green is not really the nice mint green I was expecting but more bright and shiny."
1,Blender blunder,"Blender has a on off switch that is not secure. After paying this much I expected something reliable.Should have purchased at a bricks and morter store that I could return it to, with out the hassle of shipping and repacking."
3,Waring Bar Blender,"Works great but it is TOO LOUD. Wish I had done more research before purchasing. For the price, I expected it to be quieter. Friends have bought blenders from other places. (i.e. Williams & Sonoma) and tell me theirs is not noisy."
3,"A top name in blenders, but has some flaws","With Waring on the product you know you're buying quality. This is a well built blender with a motor that feels like it could start your car. It is easy to clean and will crush/blend/pulverize anything you throw at it.The downside, you cant see what you blending or how well mixed it is. The metal carafe is very durable, but I wish it had a pyrex or glass one instead.The lack of more speed settings is also a bit irksome... but pulsing can obtain the same results."
4,So far so good,"So far so good with this blender. My only gripe is that is doesn't seem to crush all the ice. There's always a little piece left in the bottom. I jiggle the container, turn up the speed then back down but that ice sliver won't blend.Aside from that issue, the blender is working well."
1,Leaks after a few months,"I bought this less than 6 months ago and it now leaks. There is a rubber gasket seal on the underneath of the jar assembly which no longer seals after maybe 20 or 30 uses. Through normal use (making smoothies) its been dislodged so part of the seal is pulled into the shaft to the cutter blades and the rest of the seal extented outside the edge of the metal washer. I've pulled it apart to fix it, which works for a while but the problem repeats itself, the seal now no longer seals for more than a couple of goes.This is the only Waring product I've owned and it will be the last based on this blender as its about to be thrown out and buy a different one.On the plus side, when it didn't leak it was a good blender."
1,Too small,"This is a handsome product and is undoubtedly a good blender, but it should be noted that it is considerably smaller than most blenders. It is described as having a 32 oz container, but it will only blend 24 oz, about half of a standard KitchenAid. A more accurate representation of its functional capacity would have kept me from mistakenly ordering it."
1,Short Term Blender,"I purchased this blender in August, 2012. I prepare one fruit smoothie each day for my breakfast. As of December, 2012 the blender is now leaking badly from the seal on the bottom. I feel that the blender should last more than four months before it becomes unusable. Not worth the money spent."
1,A pretty LEMON,Bought this blender for smoothies only 4 months ago. Just suddenly stopped working. Price is too high for such a lemon. Really disappointing.
2,Don't waste your money.,Blends no better than the $35 blenders you can buy at the local superstore. Looks better though. The center piece of the lid fits so loosely you can not use it to lift the lid. You must pry it off at the corners. I probably should have returned it.
2,Didn't work for me.,"Unfortunately it didn't turn on when I received it, I had to return it and bought a different model. It looked really nice."
4,This blender makes great frozen margaritas,I bought this blender to replace a $35 Oster that died. It was definitely worth the money. There is a huge difference in quality. It can make restaurant quality frozen margaritas in about 10 seconds. The pitcher is smaller than my old Oster which could be a problem if you want to make more than 2 drinks at a time. This is why I only gave it 4 stars. When shopping for this blender it bothered me that the blender only has 2 speeds but I found that it doesn't matter. I would recommend this blender.
1,Poor Performance,"Purchased this after reading other reviews.After having it for three months with less than optimum performance in crushing even four ice cubes at one time the motor died. Would definitely explore all options before buying this [[ASIN:B00004S8F6 Waring PBB25 Professional Bar Blender, Black and Stainless Steel]."
2,LEMON,"The blender arrived this week & I am returning it already. I gave it two stars because I like how it looks - great retro green, nice looking ribbed glass jar. This blender replaces a similar Waring blender which I've used for several years & which still blends, even tho lately it sounds like pieces of metal are flying around inside the motor. I use a blender to prepare smoothies made from frozen fruit - half a banana, 5 or 6 strawberries & a cup of blueberries in a cup of water. I always chop the fruit into small pieces before blending. I'm returning this new blender because within seconds of blending the motor smells HOT - very HOT. There are so many positive reviews for this blender I gotta wonder - Why did I get a lemon? My guess is - this blender has been available for several years - perhaps the only ones left are the lemons that have been returned - just sayin'."
1,No luck with Waring Blender here,"I ran across this set of reviews while searching for a new blender. My Waring which cost serious money was in for repairs twice during warranty and just stopped working for the third time a couple of years after I bought it. I am tossing it in the trash and looking for another brand. We use it mostly for smoothies, using frozen berries, not ice. Made to the consistency of soft sherbert, one would think this not such a challenge for a ""commercial blender"" that is touted for its ice crushing ability. Perhaps I bought a lemon, but it is adious Waring for me!"
4,Small problems,"The stainless steel jar is a great improvement over glass or plastic. A larger jar would have been better. Also the motor seems to strain when mixing thicker drinks. If you mix small drinks this would be a good choice. However if you entertain a large number of people you'll want a larger jar. Does a good job of crushing ice, but will occasionally leave a few tiny pieces. Overall a good solid blender that's just a little on the small side."
2,Not for the daily maker of multiple frozen smoothies.,"Using frozen fruit to make up to 4 smoothies every day, our family is hard on blenders. After more than a year of daily experience with the Waring Pro (both MBB* & PBB* models) I cannot recommend them for serious smoothing making. Here's why:Both glass- & stainless-jug models use the same blade assembly. This blade assembly wears poorly when asked to blend frozen fruit. It fails often, and must be rebuilt or replaced. Parts are easily purchased if you're handy and have the correct tools. DETAILS: The assembly screws together, and is threaded to tighten under use rather than loosen and fall apart. But this tightening action is so great when the blade contacts frozen fruit, that it bends the metal washer below the blade. The assembly eventually becomes so tight that the shaft cannot turn.The Waring Pro is all the blender than many people will need, but is not sufficient for the daily maker of multiple smoothies."
4,Not every version of this album has Mapuna Ka Hala O Kailua on it,"I bought this album used from Jelly's in Pearl City (O'ahu, Hawai'i) and it is missing two tracks, most glaringly Mapuna Ka Hala O Kailua. In place of the missing tracks, the track Waialae has been added. The total track lineup on my version of Aloha is a part of me, a part of you.:1) Kaula Ili 2) Ka Ua Ma'ema'e 3) Waialae 4) A part of me, a part of you (The Hospital Song) 5) Aloha Is 6) Kapalai'ula 7) Hanohano Wailea 8) Na Kama O Hailua 9) Aloha ChantBuyer beware. I -love- Moe Keale and if you are unfamiliar with his music, this album is a great place to start. However, if you're buying this for that most popular track, make doubly sure the copy of the album you get has Mapuna Ka Hala O Kailua on it."
4,Amazing!,"I absolutely loved this color from start to finish. The first two weeks, the purple was huge in the sun and any light from the lightbulbs, but that's what I wanted. After a few weeks though, it turned more red than purple, and at the moment, my hair is an orange-red now, and I haven't dyed it for about a month and a half after using this product. Overall, GREAT product, I just wish it stayed purple longer."
3,"beautiful color, didn't last long","Loved the color. Was so excited to use this product. It turned out great, it just didn't last as long as I had hoped. After a week, it was already beginning to get dull and fade."
4,"Like the product, color not as expected.","I purchased mine from Target in this color and I hadn't colored my hair in about 2 years. I have some gray at the top and when I used this it turned the gray hair straight purple. I didn't really mind since purple is my favorite color ha! But other people might not appreciate the unexpected color. The rest did not turn out quite like the box, overall it was much more of a purple for me. I have very dark brown hair naturally. I still like the product as a whole though, I'm purchasing it again for that reason, but in a color closer to my natural color so that when it grows out the gray won't stand out as much."
2,does not work on black hair,"Do not waste your money on this if you have black hair. There is absolutely no difference in hair color. I'm going to use Garnier Nutrisse Ultra Color next time. Other than that, the product leaves your hair feeling soft and healthy. It smells pretty good and its not hard to use. everything you need comes in the box."
2,Missing listening tapes,Listening tapes dont come with the book. So the listening practice tests are not useful.
3,easy camera to operate pictures are average,"While it's not a difficult camera to operate and the software is simple to use, the pictures are not spectacular."
4,juicer,"It works well. More expensive than I expected but if it lasts for 10 or more citrus seasons, then it will have been worth it. I have 4 orange trees, 2 grapefruit trees, 2 tangelo trees and a lemon tree, so I do a lot of juicing. So far thus season, it has done well."
1,"Powerful, but dangerous","This juicer is a beauty to behold, sturdy and powerful, but...When my hand slipped against the revolving strainer basket it caught my thumbnail and ripped it half-off. Needless to say, I won't be using this instrument of torture again.Also, the tall design necessary to put a glass under the side makes for an awkward working angle for a short person like myself."
2,Fake!!!,"I own and wrote a glorious review of my Waring blender with stainless steel body which looks nearly identical to this, however, this product (listed as stainless steel) is fake! There is no metal in it. If you look carefully at the pictures, you can see it is exactly as the white one (which I assume is also plastic). They merely put a scratched mylar coating on the plastic. The other plastic pieces also seem flimsy and poorly made. The quality was much worse than my old, cheap $15 Braun juicer. The power of this unit is decent, but not so much that I think it qualifies for a $100 juicer. I would have given this a much better rating if it was half the price or if it really was made out of stainless steel. The ""stainless"" finish is fake and doesn't match my other stainless appliances."
4,So Much Better Than a Conventional Juicer!,"When I got into fruit and veggie juices last year, I made the mistake of getting a toy citrus juicer at the local department store. It was fine for a couple of oranges, but wimped out when I wanted to juice a bag of oranges. The Waring juicer has the oomph to produce as much juice as I want, usually about a gallon at a time.The one, very mild complaint, I have is that the basket that catches the pulp is a bit too small for the largest oranges, making it awkward to do more than a couple of oranges before cleaning out the pulp. Not a big deal, unless you are always using the large oranges.Other than that, I am very happy with this juicer! It is holding up very well after a couple months of heavy use."
1,Worst Product - Worst Service,"I bought this product because it had great reviews from several buyers. I was extremely excited when I received it but was quickly disappointed. The product had no power whatsoever. It kept on stopping each time I put any kind of pressure on the orange. Apart from looking great on the kitchen counter and very easy to clean (I have to give it that), its OJ making abilities gets 0 starts.Buyers beware that this item is not returnable and thus not refundable by Amazon or Ace Photo Digital. If you buy it you are stuck with it. I would think twice before buying this product or any product from Amazon or Ace Photo Digital as their return policy is very restricted. READ THE FINE PRINT. I should have known when the package came without the return slip and return instructions in it.I shop online all the time and this was my first Amazon experience. I have to say it was not a good one."
1,This is an inferior citrus juicer,"This is the second Waring Citrus Juicer given that the first one's motor strained with just the slightest pressure.Surprisingly, the current one, presumably with a properly working motor, also strained with pressure although it allowed for more pressure than the first, faulty unit.It appears that the motor is not very powerful. As well, the juicer attachment, over time, since it doesn't have a very tight fit over the motor shaft, will simply stop turning when pressure is applied.I returned the unit and opted for the more expensive Breville Citrus Juicer.That unit is magnitudes better than the Waring unit.My recommendation is to not even consider buying the Waring unit. It has an underperforming motor and is poorly constructed."
2,Motor Speed,"The unit looks attractive, however, I expected a better RPM. The motor is not fast enough. It takes too long to extract the juice."
2,Promise Lost,"""What's in a name ..."" went missing with this one.Clumsy to use and promises to make a mess every time.The top of the rim is sooo much higher than the reamer that it is impossible to get the half fruit fully juiced. Also, the spout does not lock in place. Therefore, while my wrist pushes down on the rim (see above) the spout will rotate away from my glass and spill juice on the counter.Waring has a great name that does not come through in this product. Overdue for redesign considering other products on the market."
5,strong and dependable,"i love it.for me this unit works great.i've had it for a few months now, and used it about 8 times thus far.so far so good. :)strong, dependable, and not too noisy.i read a review in which they described the plastic as flimsy or otherwise less than desirable, and that caused some hesitation in my purchase but i decided to take a chance anyway and i'm glad i did.the plastic parts are not flimsy or in any way inferior to any other plastic items of similar usage.another review mentioned the spout being in an inconvenient location in regards to the on off switch but since you can place the spout in any direction you like, i also view this as a non-issue.great purchase no complaints. :)"
4,"Quick ""To Go"" Breakfast!","We've had two less expensive juicers previously, but they didn't last long and/or had a very noisy, grinding sound. I bought this juicer for my husband for Christmas (our family juice-maker) and we all love it. It's much quieter, quick and an easy clean-up. He makes me and the kids a nice take-along breakfast when we're headed off to school. This is a great investment in your health!"
2,Not as expected.,"While this juicer does clean up nicely there are some design issues that I did not like. I purchased this to do grapefruits easily. They are a mess. The larger basket is great for containing the grapefruit but the extractor head is the same size as other juicers which now means your fingers keep hitting the sides of the basket. The basket has about 1/2"" rotation so you have to hold this in place while holding the fruit in the other hand. Also the inner basket allows for seeds and extra pulp to flow into the glass. Lastly, the spout is fixed. For the price this should be adjustable to be able to remove the glass to prevent drippage.I intended to use this to replace my Cuisinart CCJ-100 Citrus Pro Juicer ($25.00 and great warranty) as the product info stated it did grapefruit easily. I returned this juicer and am still very happy with my CCJ-100!"
3,Returned to purchase a Citrus Press instead,"After one use, I returned the Waring Citrus Juicer and ordered a Citrus Press instead. That one use made it obvious to me that this would not be a juicer that I would wish to use every day.Pros:* EASY to clean. I wanted to keep it for this reason alone!* SIMPLE to use. Simple to put together; simple to run.Cons:* S-L-O-W. The speed of the juicer is incredibly slow. It took almost 5 minutes to juice 2 oranges. I also had to press hard to hold the half orange on the extractor.* Wasteful. Doesn't get all the juice and pulp from the rind.If you want a simple citrus juicer that you probably won't use every day, I would be able to recommend this. Otherwise, I would advise investing in a slightly more expensive citrus press."
1,not so professional,"this juicer is not what we expected, based on the reviews we had read. it simply does not perform well at its most basic task, getting juice out of an orange or lemon. frustratingly, the motor appears to disengage when you ""press firmly"", which is the recommended operating method."
1,Beware the cheap plastic gears,"I love everything about this juicer except the cheap plastic gears. The base is sturdy and heavy. The motor is plenty strong. The design of the reamer and basket are effective and easy to clean. I usually just rinse well after use and it's ready to go again. The motor is a bit noisy. The reason for one star is the gears between the motor and the reamer are plastic. They've nearly stripped after less than one year of moderate use. Now the gears keep jumping cogs and the unit is extremely noisy. It is only a matter of time before the gears are completely stripped and the whole unit gets sent to recycling. What a waste. For the price I paid, the unit should be a lot more reliable. Engineers or product planners at Waring get an F for releasing this design. Do I really want to throw good money after bad for another Waring unit??? BTW, I am an engineer, and nothing peeves me more than an expensive product becoming useless for the sake of a $0.15 piece of plastic."
5,Wonderful,"Finally found the replacement juicer I had been looking for. It actually works better and cleans up better than my old one which I had for over 25 years. I looked at a lot juicers and found most had a lack of power, couldn't handle the larger fruits or had no weight to them. The Waring PCJ218 Citrus Juicer has it all. Would recommend to anyone who likes fresh juice."
5,Power galor,"Great Juicer. Living in the Southwest, it is lemon season and this juicer plowed through the hundreds of lemons I juiced. The switch was broken in transit but bought another switch and installed it without any problem. I'm highly satisfied with the sellers shipping time and with the juicer over all. If you want fresh orange juice every day or juice for lemonade or grapefruit juice, this is the one for you. Reasonably priced and well built. Made in the USA"
5,Outstanding Service!,This is a duplicate replacement juicer for the one I have had for six years. I am replacing it because I currently hear straining noises in the motor and don't want to take a chance of the old one conking out before I have a replacement standing in the wings to take over (since I usually juice a full 40 lb case at a time).I can't say enough great things about this product. One should remember that the motor has a full five year warranty. Most juicers you buy for around $25 are lucky if they last a year (I went through about three of 'em before finding this gem). I highly recommend!
3,Citrus Jucier,"This Jucier is powerful enough and that was the most important thing. However the design has the turn on switch front and center so that when the jucier is in the off mode, switch down, you can not place your glass up against the machine. I think it would have been better to have the switch on the side so it isn't in the way. This was purchased for my college girl and she loves it as she buys those nice costco grapefruit and uses this jucier lots."
5,Great Juicer - Very Powerful,"I have tried many juicers over the last few years since moving to FLorida. I have several orange trees in my yard, and like fresh squeezed juice every morning. Most have been dissapointing for sure. My last Braun juicer was not bad, but the motor would slow down quite a bit when I applied a decent pressure. Plus, the basket just broke and left me looking for a new model. After reading the reviews, I decided for the Waring. Yes, it is expensive compared to many Walmart juicers. But it is worth it. It has an excellent design, with a heavy cast iron base which keeps it rock solid stable on the counter when operating. The motor is very powerful, and spins the juicer at a decent speed. It is so powerful, that no matter how hard (within reason) I push down on the orange, the motor just will not slow down. GREAT!! Plus it is very easy to clean, as there are no tight corners or crevaces for bit of citrus pulp to accumulate. I definitely recommend this juicer."
1,"Plastic ""gear"" and rotating parts wear out and fail! Avoid!",Press hard enough to get all the juice out of an orange or a grapefruit and the motor either stalls out or the cheap white plastic drive deforms and fails to turn the rotating juicer device on top. Needs a stronger motor AND metal parts that would not wear and slip. Do not waste your money on this or any other juicer with plastic gearing and rotating parts!
3,Expensive citrus juicer,It's really heavy so it doesn't dance around the counter top. You need to make a LOT of orange juice to justify the high price.
3,Works ok,"I replaced a cheap Black & Decker model with auto-reverse, because the grinding noise would get on my nerves. Having said that, the cheap Black & Decker WAS as efficient as this one. So, if I were you I would check out the cheaper model before buying this one."
4,perfect for home juicing,This product worked out perfect for home juicing. It is heavy duty enough to handle alot of fruit in one juicing and also works well for just a few fruits. I find that it juices the smaller fruit better than the larger fruits (such as grapefruit and navel oranges) because the smaller fruit fits better around the reamer.
4,Good first book,"I was lucky enough to win a copy of this book, and I wasn't disappointed with the read.It started off like a murder mystery novel (not that I mind that as I love a good mystery as well) and quickly picks up steam and pulls you along as the story unfolds. The terrors and the nightmares build chapter by chapter until I was finding it harder to put the book down and ended up staying up late to finish it.The line about ""every town has it's ghosts"" ring just as true for White Falls as it does for my own sleepy little town.I look forward to seeing more novels from this author."
2,I Must Have Read a Different Book,"I do not see any of Stephen King's talents in this debut novel. Let's face it - no one is ever going to capture the talents of the ""early"" Stephen King. If I were him I would be insulted at how many new authors of subpar talent are being compared as the second coming. I thought the pace was very slow (over 100 pages in and nothing had really happened yet, too much filler, unnecessary conversations, descriptions etc.) and at times confusing. I don't need everything spelled out for me but the author jumps back and forth between characters, dreams and visions that I found myself rereading pages to see if I missed something. Characters one dimensional. I am also dismayed lately, not just with this book - there are many others, with the constant glowing blurbs by established authors. It's tainting the industry. Just didn't do it for me."
2,"As your grandmother told you, ""Don't judge a book by its cover!""","""Bloodstone"" is a plodding supernatural tale that never got off the ground for me. I struggled to get through the first 200 pages and should have stopped at that point and moved on to another book. I kept going only because a number of reviewers noted that the book improved dramatically during its last third. Well, maybe that was true, but not enough for me to give the book more than two stars.The book contained characters that I really didn't care about, and frankly, found unlikeable. The story, at least in my humble opinion, certainly didn't match the book's exciting and provocative cover. Kenyon's novel has been compared to the work of Stephen King; in my estimation the only thing ""Bloodstone"" has in common with anything that King's written was that it used Maine as the setting for the story."
2,"Glee 5 stars, Video on Demand ZERO","Last year you could download eps from amazon into i tunes, it worked fine. Now they force you to download their own player, the downloads take hours per ep, and the player doesn't work half the time. The same ep takes me less than 2 minutes in i tunes. If you don't want to encourage amazon forcing everyone into their own system instead of working with what we already have, I suggest we all either wait for the dvd or get eps from i tunes."
1,ANNOYING CHARACTER,"Can't stand watching this show because of Lea Michele. Otherwise, I would have been a fan.STOP FOCUSING THE SHOW ON HER. THERE ARE SO MANY MORE TALENTED PEOPLE ON THIS SHOW THAT DESERVE STORYLINES THAT DON'T END UP SCREWING THEM OVER."
1,:(,I knew this set of DVD's was used but I did expect them all to play! I have only gotten to the 4th disk and only 2 work! So I have missed most of the season already!
1,I need help,I bought your Glee Second Season Dvd pack and I am very unhappy. The disks are not working. I have tried the disks on many different players. I would either like to return it or get a refund. I hope you can help me.
2,sily love songs,the music is ok but not just what I was looking for. I will keep on looking. some of the song I never heard .
3,Brand new--but not a Region 1 DVD set!!,"Since it is not a Region 1 (America) DVD set, it changed the settings on my brand new laptop to Region 5 (that's ASIA!!!!) so, that is not cool that it was not specified. I thought it looked ""kind of"" different...but couldn't put my finger on it until I tried to put one of my AMERICAN dvds in my player--it said I would have to change my regional settings and I am only allowed to do that 4 times total. Please put that in your description--it IS important and you're not being 100% honest with your buyers."
1,"rating the DVD quality, not the show","The DVDs I got were very poor quality. They kept breaking into pixels, sometimes to the point that they stopped playing altogether. I rarely get bad DVDs anymore-overall the quality seems to have improved. Having 3 very bad discs in the second season of Glee makes me think they cut corners."
4,Bit of a struggle this season but still a great show,"Loved the first season and the second season...although at time a bit of a struggle...is still one of the best shows on tv.My only question is on the pricing. How come the DVD pre-order price jump so high? $15 higher than the blue ray? I don't understand.But back to the review.This season introduced some new characters and pulled back on some of the mainstays. This is good. I love Lea Michelle but don't need every episode to be about her. I like that it featured some of the other members of the Glee club. Looking forward to season 3 doing more of that as it sets up the departure of the ""senior"" members."
5,Season 2,I'm not sure why anyone would dislike this show or the season as it's a reflection of so many people around the world who deal with all sorts of different things. Either way I really enjoyed the season and everything that came with it.
5,Glee Season 2,"Bought this item as a gift for my sister, since she is such a glee fanatic. Can in fast and well secured."
5,Favorite Season,"I love the series, but I think this, the 2nd season is my favorite! The third season is close to my favorite though. Glee is a series that is difficult to watch without seeing previous seasons. I'd recommend starting with Season 1 if you haven't seen it. It's difficult to watch out of order because of all the plot line/twists, references to previous episodes, and inside jokes. However, I highly recommend Glee to anyone."
4,"One of the last ""must buy"" disk sets","Thanks to the various streaming sources for television shows, we've pretty much stopped buying them. While we rarely watch them on other disks, TV or movies, they are what we watch the most on these. We've enjoyed the various character focuse extra's, but the Jukeboxes for each season are great! We'll pop those on and let them run like a radio station in the background and then come charging back to the TV to watch our favorite production numbers."
5,Incredible talent........beautiful CD,"I tried to find this CD locally and it was sold out. I got online and here it was. I bought it for a gift but ended up keeping it for myself. I suggest you buy it when you see it and not wait and say, ""I'll get it at another time."""
5,Glee Fan!,"Yeah, Yeah... another glee fan... I really like the blue-ray quality. I saw for fist time this season on netflix, the picture wasn't really good, but I notice the big difference with the blue ray. Plus the bonus are priceless. The first episode comment by the cast is really entertained!"
5,Never a false note,"I'm a really unlikely fan of this series - an older guy who originally thought, ""teens in high school? - glee club singing?... I'll pass"". That was then - I'm HOOKED! The story lines are crazy, often very silly satire, but then, out of nowhere, it will hit you with something real, something meaningful and sometimes heartbreaking. The characters are wildly stereotypical but we know them all. They're mostly charicatures, but like all good charicature, they make us smile at the truth even in exaggeration. Jane Lynch, in the role of a lifetime, plays it to the hilt - and beyond. The writing is rock solid and always true and respectful to character. The singing and musical numbers are - and I can't believe I'm saying this - often breathtaking. There's love and smart choices everywhere in the production. It will rock you, it will touch your heart, it will make you laugh out loud, it will give you things to think about. What else is there?"
3,It was okay. Thanks.,"I was happy to receive the package but when I opened it, the dvd box was cracked and a corner was missing. Some of the dvds were scratched more than expected. One disc was almost damaged in the center. Not really worth what it had cost. Thanks anyway."
4,Almost perfect,This was what I ordered. I got all the way through the season and the last episode was messed up. The disc had been damaged a little. It was a new and still in the wrapper so I believe this damaged occurred in manufacturing.
5,Glee,Loved this episode of Glee. This was a part of a gift from one of my sons. Amazon made the downloading very easy for a non-tech savvy person. The show was very clear on my computer screen. I will order other programs from Amazon as I want them.
3,"Beautiful music, failed plot","Mercedes (Amber Riley) proves once again that she is the most jaw-dropping, passionate performer on the show. Mike (Harry Shum, Jr.) does some of his best dancing ever seen on the show. Tina's (Jenna Ushkowitz) solo had a promising start. And that is part of what makes this all so disappointing.After this episode, the show will once again go back to ignoring these incredibly talented stars. But at least they have this moment to shine. (Except maybe Tina, who is once again cut short).The musical performances are fantastic and are the best part of this episode. The plot is lacking and isn't very well planned out. The guest stars are amusing and all, but not necessary. They don't add much and as soon as they leave the screen, they're easily forgotten.There are some funny moments and Santana gets to really kick butt in a throwaway scene. Other than that, this is an episode that is easily neglected."
2,video quality,It's so frustrating that the video keeps freezing up on me. I'm only 10 minutes through the episode and it's frozen 4 times!!! I don't see paying for episodes I can't even watch!!!! Rediculous! I'm not a happy customer!
3,Change from season one...,"Just a warning to parents that the first few episodes are a bit risque for younger viewers, so if you are watching Glee with your kids for the singing, etc., you may want to preview the episodes and skip some parts. We haven't watched all the episodes yet, but have found we need to be careful about what parts we let our 10 year old see. The musical performances, of course, are once again awesome!"
5,Awesome,Glee is an awesome show nd i like how it shows old songs but with a new younger twist nd also with up to date songs as well
5,Glee! Original Song Episode,"This is the Season 2 episode 16 ""Original Song"" in high definition. This is BY FAR my favorite Glee episode because of all of the ""monumental"" things that happen in it. Although this version is in high definition, I had some difficulties with the recording qualities being sub par in the beginning, but by the time 5 minutes had passed they had been corrected. For anyone who has a love of Glee, or anyone wanting to get an overall picture of it, this is the episode to see! Great music, great actors, and great quality! I highly reccommend it to all!

5,Love it!!,I love Glee! Owning the season was such a great idea... I love the extras where you can watch just the songs and not the whole episode. So glad I bought this!!
3,It's okay,I'm not really a fan of the series but I bought this for my daughter's Christmas present and she was a huge fan in the early days of the show.
3,Ehh...So- So season,I only own this because there was a few episodes I enjoyed. Also loved the perfornaces.Just I really don't understand where the writers were trying to focus on.
5,Second season,Its okay for the review because of how the glee club recruit new members.I like how Sue yells at everyone.I would recomend to myself
2,ALMOST perfect!,"It might just be my DVD player, but one episode had skips on the first disc. After pausing the DVD then playing again, the skipping seemed to stop completely.But upon their speedy arrival, these DVDs were in perfect condition! There is really no indication that they were ever used at all. (besides that they were not sealed, duh!) Not one scratch, all in perfect condition, and nicely organized and packaged.I LOOOOVE GLEE!!!!!! Now all I need is Season 3!12/2/2012THESE DVDS ARE SCRATCHED!! DVD 4 & 5 are both scratched! They both have sooooo many skips! It's unbearable to even get through one episode! This seller is a liar! I am SO disappointed! Will never buy from you again!"
2,Glee,Very disappointing. I guess you have to see them perform to truly appreciate their singing. The songs alone didn't do it for me...
3,What Happen?,"Season 1 was good but season 2 so far STINKS!!!!!!!!!!!. Who are these people? I'm really happy for the Kurt storyline {it's needed} but that's the only story that they are telling. They are adding more people to this show while we still don't know anything about the ones that are there. I know more about Blaine & Sam than I know about all the girls in glee [except Rachel]. Glee has become a bad over-hyped music video. Season 1 they chose songs that went with the story which made us care about these people but now there IS NO STORY! just songs that shouldn't be. That's why it's a now a 50 minute video. So far this season ""DUETS"" was good from start to finish,it's the only reason I'm sticking with the show. Hopefully the writers are listening to the fans out-cry of lack of continuity and fix it so the 2nd half of this season can make sense or at lest be good."
1,"Love Glee, hate Amazon Instant Video","Glee is great, however, the Amazon Instant Video does not download onto macs, which means I can only watch the video when I'm online. If i wanted to watch it online,i could go onto hulu or any other website. Total ripoff."
5,I'm a Gleek!,I am really enjoying season two of Glee and i can't wait for it to come out on DVD so i can get my fix in marathon sessions...Glee is a must...
2,Inferior to the first season in every way,"First I'll admit that I didn't expect to like the first season of Glee but after being forced to watch a couple episodes I ended up really enjoying it. The storylines were generally smartly written, the characters likeable and the tone of the show was mature enough for adult audiences without alienating younger ones.For this second season almost everything good about the first has been stripped down and reduced to a musical soap opera for teenagers. This in itself could be OK given the shows primary demographic except the first season set the bar so much higher. The majority of the characters have been rewritten into trite caricatures of their formal selves and come across as petty and unlikeable. The adult actors still deliver fine performances but their roles have been pushed far into the sidelines to make room for more high school angst. Overall there were only a handful of standout episodes and just as many were embarrassingly bad."
3,Product Damaged,"I ordered a DVD Season of a show I absolutely love. It did arrive amazingly fast and was wrapped as if new, but once it was opened it looked used. One of the discs had a chip in it, the middle plastic piece was broken, and two of the discs won't stay in their holder. The discs are viewable so I kept the product, but I will never order from this distributer again."
2,Downloading,"I bought this episode so I could could have it and watch it on my computer, not just online. When I am trying to dowload it with the amazon software it tells me that it is going to take over 2 hours to download. It is a great episode. But dont buy it if you dont have the time to download it."
5,Friday,"I thought this episode, ""Prom Queen"" was a lot of fun. The Glee cast actually made that silly song, ""Friday"" cool. Who would of thought? Rebecca Black actually wrote a fun song...it's too bad people are so cruel and made that poor girl's life miserable. Kudos to the Glee writers and song people for preforming the song. Nice statment to the haters."
3,Production quality issues,"One disk has skips and freezes. I cleaned the disk, then tried playing it in 2 other devices, and had the same issues. However, they only affected one episode, so I did not return it."
5,Glee The Complete Second Season,Wonderful series. I hope it last for many seasons to come. I especially like the love interests for Kurt and Blaine! I cheered when they took to the dance floor. Being married to a gay man it makes it a lot easier to identify with the very subtle and no so subtle homophobia in our world. Education is the key. If this show does nothing else it shows the normalcy of our gay and straight families!Bravo!
4,"Drama drama, but okay music",I watch glee every now and then when I'm in a particular mood. I like some of the cheesy pop covers and others I don't.
2,If you’re a Gay Activist you going to love this show!,"Season 2 doubles down on the 1st seasons theme of hyper pro pop culture activism. I did like the basic plot of nerds “Geeks” in theater at high school having to balance Glee club with their peers perception of it. And of course the talent is outstanding. I even liked most of the song selections and arrangements, but just way too many homosexual and lesbian side plots going on. The constant attempt to shape the viewers moral- judgment has pushed me off the edge. I will not go back for season three because of it. If you took that stuff out of it, or at least limited it to a single sub-plot, I would have given this show 4 stars."
2,problem with discs,"cannot get these discs to play in my player....says they are unreadable.....i am not sure why they won't play....they came in the original package, so that shouldn't be the problem....."
2,"Every song is on the bigger, better sets.","Oh My Goodness! EVERY song on this CD is in the 60 song, 3 CD box set ""Stand Up and Cheer"" except for ""Fifth Avenue"" and ""Lay-De-Oh"", but those two ARE in the 51 song, two volume compilation, ""America's Sweetheart""...So, if you will ever want to own all of the songs from Shirley's movies it would be much better to buy those other two sets."
5,Only tanner that works,"I'm not in competition bodybuilding, but I saw this product and had to try it because I've been looking for an sunless tanner that had realistic effects. It works!I put the tanner on the sponge applicator and smeared it everywhere. I let it dry for about an hour and went to bed. The next morning, I toke a shower and rinsed the product off and it left a realistic looking tan behind.There are some cautions about this product though: becareful not to get it on fabric or leather furniture, if using overnight sleep on old sheets, and using it on your face can cause blackheads.I know those cautions would probably make most people give it a lower than 5-star rating, but I'm so happy with the color of tan that I see my way past them. Also, the tan lasts about 4-6 days.If you want a quick realistic tan that will last about a week, try it."
5,Good for every day!,"I am a competitive Body Builder. I do not feel that this is dark enough for competition. I use REAL Pro Tan (name brand this is by performance brands not pro tan) or I get sprayed at the event. However this is the BEST for an everyday dark tan. I used this last weekend for a trade show (I was trade show model). I sprayed the morning of the event, rinsed off in the shower (without washing)... I didn't want my costume stained. This made my tan perfect!!! I darkened through the day but I was a sunkissed dark brown. This stayed on for 6 days now... I am buying another bottle today! I promised my daughter I would stay out of tanning beds... I found my safe alternative! But be careful this will stain carpet, walls, clothing, fingernails... etc just be tidy about it!"
5,Great Product,"I use this for Ballroom Dancing competitions. It is time consuming to put on as compared to a lotion, but because it is both a bronzer and a self tanner it is well worth the effort."
4,Good product... Crappy Sprayer,"I have used this product for a body building competition. It is a fantastic color. I had one of the nicest tans on stage. My trainer hand painted me the night before and then smoothed me the day of with dream tan.The 2nd time I went to use the product, the sprayer had stopped working and I had to do an emergency tan with the onsite tanners, NW Competition Color. I can't return the bad sprayer, that is really lame! They need to fix the sprayer on the product. I won't order again because I never know if it will work correctly, who needs that stress the night before a competition?"
5,Awsome,"My 1st time ever trying pro tan and this def was exactly what i was expecting, got the product in 3 days exactly after ordering, product works great."
4,Great tan...for a lot of work.,"I do not compete in body building or pageants, I bought this product to gain an everyday-summer-tan, and it works great! The application is somewhat time consuming & messy, especially the first time. Once I got the hang of the application process, it became easier. The color looks GREAT--not too dark, not too light, not streaky. In fact, when I was first applying the product I was worried it would look terrible the next morning, when in fact the color blended and developed well overnight. This product does work, but there are easier and cheaper products that will get the job done just as well. I would recommendBanana Boat Summer Color Self Tanning Mist: 5 OZfor an equivalent tan."
5,Good tan.,We used a whole 16oz. can on top of a good base tan and a another coat from a second can. His tan came out great!
5,The Silver dawn.,"A great jewel,it's Santo and also one of his first films ever. Done in Cuba before the Castro regimen when it was not as complicated for a foreign film company to work there, it shows action and why not ? Nostalgia."
2,"Lame. ""sexy light jazz and soul""","I'm a big fan of the Naked music series, but this is definitely not a ""must have."" A little too light soul jazz ala ""the quiet storm"" for my tastes. I prefer the house sounds of their earlier records. ""Beautiful Tomorrow"" was flirting with those sounds on this record, but there were enough house elements where I could handle it. This I can't. Sold it. I keep hearing TLC mixed with Manhattan Transfer ? Am i wrong? Just a down-tempo house fan I guess. Try Nude Dimensions volume one instead."
2,"Over-produced, over-polished, over-rated","Here Rene makes an interesting tackle towards more complex beat programming, albeit never escaping the 4/4 pattern. However, this is not what either quality nu soul followers or deep house heads would like too much. All tracks are recycled around the same predictable, easy-going, smooth, 'soulful' style. No surprises here, simply usual rnb stuff that all girls love, perhaps of a slightly more discerning variety."
2,Added info,The theme from The Rebel is not even the Johnny Cash song even though it says so. Its the generic instumental which was tacked onto the opening credits of the show when it was re-syndicated in the 80s and they had a problem clearing the rights to the song.
1,Merely a copy of Ayn Rand and Muscle& Fitness articles,"Nearly half of this book is a reprint of Mike Mentzer's Heavy Duty Training Advice that the author reprinted from old Muscle and Fitness magazines. His material about Dorian Yates's training is reprinted from old muscle magazines as well and is partially incorrect at that. The ONLY thing good about this book were the pictures and he used virtually the same photos several times at that. Hey Little, how many times can you use a photo of Mentzer on a Nautilus Pullover machine? I am a HUGE Mentzer fan having had a phone consultation with him once but this book straight up sucks. I view this book as nothing more that trying to milk another dollar off of Mentzer's good name. As the previous review stated there is nothing here that is original. If you were a regular reader of muscle magazines, you know all of this information already. Save yourself the money and purchase a book written by Mentzer himself such as Heavy Duty 1 and 2."
4,the best on consolidation training,"the research Mike did in the two years before his death is the most important part of this book. Read it carefully, ignore the pictures. The publisher should not have included photos of Mike from his training days in the 70's. In the text Mike teaches that single joint isolation exercises can lead to over training. The most productive workout can be had in a brutal four to six minutes!"
5,Best Bodybuilding book ever. I wish I had this information in the book 25 years ago!,"Mike Mentzer's book is the absolute truth of how to train, and grow huge muscle's. Since I have started using Mike's principle's using high intensity training I stay sore up to 5 to 7 days. I have been training for 25 years and thought that I had reached my full genetic potential. I am 235 pounds and have already gained 5 pounds in four weeks. I squatted with 550 pounds using forced reps and negetives with rest-pause and felt the stimulation deep within my muscle fibers. You definitely have to rest your entire system training this way. Hail! Hail, to Mike Mentzer for sharing the truth. I thank you greatly."
4,Not as bad as other people have said.,"Most people who are going to read this book are either doing it for their IB or AP European History class. This is the all-in-one resource. It does get a bit dry at points, but then you just have to remember what you are reading about. The only book that I found to be better than Palmer was Contemporary Europe: A History by James Wilkinson and H. Stuart Highes. Overall Palmer is a great resource and can be kinda fun to read if you go at it with the right mindset."
4,Overall it get's the job done.,"True this is a tough book to finnish reading. It's rather dry but is packed with a vast amount of wonderful information. As a primary textbook for an AP European History class it benifited me greatly, after I re-read each page at least twice. For you teachers of the class out there, I'd make it a supplement, not the primary source for information at the high school level. College professors well you can make your students suffer through it. It's not too bad!"
2,Good luck. You'll need it.,"I'll admit it's been five years since I gladly returned this volume to my AP European History teacher in 10th grade. Time, though, cannot erase the memories I have of this book and the neverending struggle I faced each time I opened it. If you adore European history, perhaps this is the book for you, but if not, you've got some row to hoe. This book is very, very long. It is dry. It has precious few pictures to break up the monotony. It is definitely a college-level textbook -- which makes it appropriate for an AP class, but don't expect it to be interesting reading. However, if you are able to read the book without your mind wandering (not an easy task), you may learn a lot from it."
4,Different,"As one is opt to notice that this ""text book"" is much differnt than other text books that students use throughout their history studies. amoung the many differences one may notice, size, and diction may be the biggest two on the list. This is an advance placement course which does require much more reading (R.R. Palmer has not lacked in this category) and a more advanced reading level. The choices in words that Robert Rosewell Palmer has made are interesting as to why he would choose these particular words. I have also noticed the suttle yet ample amount of sarcasm buried within his text. This provides readers with a logical ""reenactment"" of the context yet also provides his analysis of events throughout history. All these factors create for an interesting read. To fully understand one must pick a copy of Palmer up and experiance it first hand. After doing so, I have concluded that R.R. Palmer and Joel Coltons - A History of The Modern World (8th Edition) is simply....Different"
1,Avoid this book if you can,"This is a textbook of the APEuro class. It is very boring and often difficult to understand. I think that you avoid this book if you can. However, it is very good at putting you to sleep. On top of all of this, it's looong! Good luck if you have to read it."
1,I hate this book.,"I hate this book.. To all people even thinking about purchasing it - run away - far, far away - and never even think about it again.. I hate it.. This book is just about as easy to read, as is a book in some foreign language upside down! Never buy it.. Never.. Any questions? Feel free to write. (Okay, okay.. I must say - it is a lot of details - and if you are able to get through it - you will know every single little detail there ever was to know about history.. including lots of junk about splitting logs, fertilizer.. More than you ever thought was European HIstory..)"
1,Useless waste of time.,"This book ruined my life. Picture this, having the weekend free except having to read and outline 1 simple chapter in this book. Sounds easy, right? Wrong! This book uses vocabulary Walt Fraizer wouldn't understand. When talking about gov't and philosphy, the editors decided it best to ""assume"" you understood the meaning of words such as Pan-Slavism w/o explaining at all. Rather than explain history and give a brief overview of events, the book mentions EVERY-SINGLE-LITTLE-FACT, not letting you know which are important. This can simply be shown in the sheer number of pages, 1259. A sheer waste of much needed trees if you ask me...."
1,Did not fit a 14.1 sony laptop,"The word mini should have been a hint to me, but it said it would fit up to a 14.1 size laptop. My Sony laptop did not fit, it was sticking out of the bag about a half a inch."
2,zipper broke,i love the bag except that i've had it for a little over two months and the zipper broke. the zipper is completely off track and i am unable to close the back of the bag. too late to exchange it. :-(
3,Nice bag but...,"The zipper broke is less than 2 weeks, good size, many pockets, nice look, without good zipper, the bag still trash."
5,Impressive Bag,"Ordered bag for my 10"" netbook. Fits with room to spare! My 13"" white macbook fits perfect. Plenty of pockets for adapter and external dvd drive. The outside pocket holds my Thermos Nissan 2456P 18-Ounce Stainless-Steel Hydration Bottle perfectly. I ordered the Dr. Pepper color and I love the little bit of sparkle in the red color. I don't usually leave reviews but was SO happy with this bag I had to leave a review."
3,A little big for Netbook Mini(s),"There is no doubt that this is a very nice bag. It appears to be good quality. However, it is a bit large for a 10.5"" netbook. Keep that in mind if you are looking for something small to carry your netbook in. However because it is a messanger bag it would probably work well to carry the netbook and accessaries as well as your Kindle, iPod and probably a wallet."
3,Nice product...too bad my laptop did not fit.,"Nice size bag. It has plenty of pockets. The main compartment for the laptop and or tablet is nicely padded.I'm about 5'10"" and the shoulder strap is barely long enough for me to put the bag across my chest. Anybody taller or wider than myself would have trouble. (as some reviews have mentioned).The tag on the bag mentions it can store a laptop up to 14.1"". I have a Lenovo Yoga 13 (13.3 in ultrabook). It didn't fit in the bag. It stuck out just enough so that I couldn't zip up the compartment. I think a 13 in would've been fine. It's a shame really as I like the design of this bag. I'm returning the bag and it's back to searching again for a cool messenger bag."
2,Close but not perfect,"The strap is too short (i am 5'7"" and it hangs around 8 inches from my armpit going across my chest.maybe it is a pros though as it prevents too mush swaying of the bag while walkingNo shoulder pads to lessen the weight on the shoulderMain zipper pouch.the tablet slot is too narrow so i end up putting the tablet on the other sideFlap area.the mesh pouch (other side no zipper) is flimsy and uselessMain zipper is flimsy,please do not use rubber tabs.use hard plasticPlease have a longer shoulder strapUse removable shoulder strap with snap on linkWider tablet slotPlease add a rain cover that can be tucked in the bottom (tethered).i want to keep all my gadgets inside from rainFor the flap area,make it a bit wider so more items can fit insideAdd hard foam at the back of bag to prevent tablet breakage"
3,She Said Yes,"""She Said Yes"" is a good book. It is about an unusual experience with a normal person who thinks nothing can happen to her daughter. Then the unthinkable to her happens. This is an inspirational book and it tells you to do what you feel is right. If you do this you should have no regrets. This book was a very interesting experience because the author is a normal person."
1,You Talkin' To Me?,"My Review is for You Talkin' To Me? 1987/1988?, 1hr 35mins:43, Starring Jim Youngs,James Noble, I saw this movie on Hulu, where you can see it for yourself, I thought the plot was a jab at Conservatives,Reagan, A guy robbin' a surf shop mentions Reaganomics, then the guy who runs a Christian network(I am Catholic so it doesn't bother me)turns out to be a Reagan Supporter and is ""racist"". The acting is bad,the movie's social message is not a Social message but some warped typical hollywood liberal nonsense. see it for free on Hulu like I did. and judge for yourself.The Main Character(Bronson Green) is a De Niro Fanatic and Loves the Movie Taxi Driver, and is very annoying."
1,An insult,"A friend showed me this book while visiting the local book mega store. It bears little resemblance to Oscar Wilde's actual classic novel, even symbolically, except on that symbolic level preferred by dilletantes today known as ""superficiality."" I have seen the work of many so-called ""starving artists,"" men and women of low incomes yet rich in talent. It is almost heartbreaking, watching them try to break into the almost impenetrable world of fine-arts photography publishing. Karl Lagerfeld, on the other hand can buy his way into the art photography world. But he can not buy talent. There was once a time when women were portrayed as sexy and alluring, WITH curves, such as the legendary Alberto Vargas painted them. That's the problem with the fashion world today: Women are shorn of their femininity in order to please a warped minority, who'd rather they look like 13 year old boys."
5,best charger,"Best charger ever. It has 4 modes. It provides lots of information. It has individual circuit for each cell.With the La Crosse, I weeded out a few bad batteries with less than 50 mAh. Actually, I found all GP batteries I have are bad. I bought them cheap. I immediately threw all GP away."
5,Just excellent,"Very nice charger. I've been using it every week. Works great in hot conditions. Recommended 100%A warning, the refresh cicle takes days with AA batteries in the default charge (200)."
4,Price too high,The price difference between Bc-700 and Bc-900 is high... if you are not going to use the rapid charge(wich we wont to max the battery life). go for the Bc-700 instead. The batteries that comes with it are not of much use. get the BC-700 and the latest low discharge rechargeable batteries.Updated after an years of useBut the performance is very good. I use the Sanyo batteries with them.
1,Not so good,"Sadly this product did not make the cut. Followed directions carefully, gave the charger many hours to do the job but it could not fully charge the batteries provided. 1 out of 4 charged. Tried other batteries and results were worse."
3,Fragile! But otherwise ok,"My only complaint is that the power plug is too generic, allowing my 3 year-old to plug in anything, including a 19 V adapter. The La Crosse doesn't even have a fuse but simply went BOOM! (literally). I tried replacing the exploded cap, but to no avail."
5,The only one to get!,"Great working charger! The l.e.d. screen is a must. This charger gives you all the info you need as you charge/discharge or recondition your cells. BTW, it comes with 4AA 2600Mha and 4AAA 2600 NiMH. I like these as much as my Sanyos' & Duracells since they hold a charge almost just as long. It is a good investment if you plan to charge many Flash packs and transmitter Batts. You won't be disappointed with this product."
4,Quite a money saver!,"La Crosse Technology BC-9009 AlphaPower Battery ChargerHaving two battery-consuming grandchildren in my house, this battery charger is saving me money two ways.Obviously, using rechargeable batteries saves $ over those use-once-throw-away types. I've been using them for years. However, after a while they don't fully recharge. Without a system for telling the newer ones from the older, less charged ones, you may find that the rechargeables you just put in your camera work only for a few shots. Not good. (They will always fail at a critical moment, such as during the Christmas Program at elementary school.)But the AlphaPower Batter Charger saves money another way. It shows you how much charge is left in your batteries! When the old ones fail to significantly recharge, ditch 'em. Nothing is worse that relying on a soon-to-be dead battery.Great product, especially if you can get it on sale."
5,Best charger I ever Used,This charger is great. I bought a battery operated radar detector for my new car(2010 Camaro) and the batteies wouldn't last over 2 hours of constant use. The claims of the company said 11 hours I went back to Radio Shack and complained and they said that 2 hours is all you can get with these battery operated units they offered to take it back. I called the company and they said it was probably the batteries but they sent me new batteries and a new charger. I used the new bat and charger lasted about 8 hours. I saw this charger ordered it and read the directions thru a couple times and charged the old batteries they are lasting over 12 hours and still going. I use only this charger for all of my batteries now. A Great charger.
1,AVOID: Made by La Crosse,"Over the last few years the quality of La Crosse products in general has fallen below acceptable levels. ""New"" battery chargers lasting a year or less, Atomic Clocks and Weather Stations the same. Buttons malfunctioning, firm-FAULT ware existing and updates bug ridden. Buy La Crosse? BEWARE"
1,defective disappointment,"Received this today and started charging the 4 AA's that were included. Unit began charging as indicated ... two hours later I went to check and the screen was entirely blank and unit seemed to be unoperational. Unplugged, removed batteries, and retried. Nothing. Less than two hours of use and the thing had obviously died. Very disappointing, and a hassle to have to mess with returning, etc. Will go to local store and buy a shelf brand...."
2,"Takes a long time to charge batteries, and is confusing to operate - fails long term","Works great, but takes a long time for batteries to charge, and the operation can be cumbersome and frustrating.It does the job effectively, and comes with TONS of great extras and conversions.UPDATE (4/2011):This product was only used a few times. I recently tried to charge several batteries, including the ones that came with the unit. Only one of the charge slots would work.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. It is too expensive for something that fails so quickly."
5,Works Great and You Can Monitor What is Happening..,From the other reviewers comments this sounded like a winner. It worked as billed and refreshed about 15 batteries I had that were in various stages of decline. Most importantly it allowed me to pull the 2 bad batteries that seemed to be getting into the mix and shortening the life of their passengers in my devices. They tested low after refreshing and have been tossed.
2,batter selection button won't come up - might be killed by heat,I left 4 batteries on the unit for overnight refresh. The next thing I found was the #3 button sink and won't come up any more. The battery was very hot. I believe the #3 button was melt by heat. I have version 33 and purchased on 12/1/2006. This unit lasts 3 weeks or so.
1,"Bad product, bad customer service","I bought the charger. Charged batteries that weekend. Worked fine. A couple of weeks later I tried to charge batteries. It didn't work. Did all the things I was suppossed to do off the website. Didn't work. Sent an email. Got no response. Sent another email, got a good response: will extend the warranty since they were currently out of stock. However, no information about what to ""do."" Sent another email. Got a response: I had to pay to ship it to them to fix. They refused to send a prepaid shipping label, ""That's the warranty policy."""
1,FIRE HAZARD!,Well I purchased mine Dec 10 2009 and yesterday Dec 25 2009 I was charging a new set of eneloops when I smelled something burning. I went and checked and sure enough the button on the 3rd slot had already collapsed and the screen was turning black. I highly recommend not buying this charger if you value your property. I have just purchased the PowerEx MH-C9000 WizardOne. This was the 6th set of batteries in the charger.
3,OK with reservations - build quality is subpar,The build quality is not very good. The unit I received would only charge in 3 of 4 slots when I first plugged it in. I took it apart and examined the circuit board and found several bad solder joints. I pulled out my soldering iron and repaired the bad connections. Now it works fine. It was a simple fix and saved me the hassle of having to ship it back but I would not expect other to do the same.
5,I have three of these. Perfect!,"Others will write the geek reviews. I agree. I have had one of these for a couple of years. It does what my other chargers won't. The problem is that my other chargers also destroy a battery every now and then. One day I decided: ""why not toss the junk chargers and get two more La Crosse?"" And that is what I did. So, now I always have four AAA and eight AA batteries ready any day any time.Oh, I don't push any buttons. I just put the batteries in and let the La Crosse do it's thing."
2,"Worked well for a while, but now does not power on at all","I was happy with the charging (on Eneloop AA batteries) for a while, but sadly this product eventually stopped powering on at all. Maybe a problem with the AC adapter required to power the device??"
1,EXPLOSION!,Had this for 2 years and it worked great until it exploded and killed 4 of my batteries. La Crosse wants $25 bucks to review it and I have to pay for shipping. Never buying from them again.
5,Works flawlessly,Being into radio contol I have lots of AA NiMH batteries laying about. After this charger arrived it spent a solid week working nonstop while I attempted to ressurrect some older AA's. Neither the power supply or the charger itself ever got above slightly warm. I'll probably be getting another one so I can charge eight at a time.
5,A Most Excellent Little Charger!,This little unit has made using rechargeable batteries a breeze. It's even revived some old rechargeable batteries that I had. I highly recommend this unit for those who are heavy battery users. Now be very sure to read the instructions on this unit before using it. And if you are using the refresh function let it run it's course which will take several days on old batteries.
5,LOVE THIS CHARGER!!!!,I was super worried after seeing this product get yanked a few times from Amazon.I'm happy to say that the version I got has worked perfectly for months now with several different types of batteries.It's great to have more control over my charging than the stock Sanyo Eneloop chargers provided.
4,Great with an exception,"I read the first review, which is very helpful, however I should have been more careful and not shopped spur of the moment.This charger does not charge size C and D batteries. It does however come with adapters to run electronics that require C and D batteries off of AA batteries...that is to say, the adapters are not for charging C and D batteries. I should have read more.It seems that a lot of thought went into charging AA and AAA batteries the proper way while completely neglecting C and D batteries. This will be great to charge my GPS and external flash high output batteries, but I'll have to pick up yet another charger for C and D size batteries. Bummer."
4,battert charger w/batteries,The product is nice but one of the AAA batteries will not take a charge.
1,DOA - no power to this thing,"Just a warning. I got this and the transformer was dead. So it may work great, but mine was dead on arrival."
1,Overrated,"I had a ton of old rechargeable battery's that stopped holding charges so I thought from reading all the reviews, that this charger would pay for itself. I followed the directions to renew them, and none of them worked. Disappointed"
4,Good Charger.,"It's been over a year since my purchase of this charger, still works great, my only gripes would be it's hard to see the screen without a good amount of ambient light. The time allotted to switch between modes before it initializes the mode that it's going to use, seems to be a bit fast sometimes, especially when you haven't used the charger for awhile and can't remember exactly what mode you want to choose."
4,Nice Charger - Makes it easy to weed out bad batteries,"Since this charger gives a reading on each individual battery, it is easy to cull out any bad cells. We have so many electronics around the house that use AA that we really give them one heck of a test. Though the batteries have a high power rating, their life cycle was shorter than others we use. I didn't keep track of how long they were in use, but we had some other brands in use before we got these and the others are working better now that time has past. You will get plenty of use out of these batteries though. I would definitely recommend this setup."
1,Another meltdown,"Like many other recent purchasers of the BC-9009, mine has overheated and partially melted one of the buttons. This occurred while charging 4 QUALITY cells (Duracell rebadged Eneloops) @ 1000mA. The money you save over a Maha C-9000 isn't worth the damage this charger could do."
3,Reconditioned BC-900 Had Substandard Soldering,"This unit would not stop charging some battery slot(s) so it popped the seal of an AAA battery, ruining it. Disassembly revealed hurried and bad hand-soldering: cold and shorting solder joints. With soldering corrected, performance is very good now."
1,"Worthless Product, Rude Customer Support","I ordered one about 6 months ago. It never worked. It would initialize normally, but once batteries were put into it, the charger would reset and initialize itself every 10 seconds or so. I sent it back for replacement and after talking to the rudest customer support person, got a RMA number. They sent me a new one and this one does the exact same thing! This is with any capacity of battery I use. Maybe the newer version is better (mine is a version 32), but this one is a complete disappointment."
5,Best charger I've owned,"This is an excellent charger. The best and most detailed that I've seen and used. I recommend it to anyone who is serious about energy consumption and getting the most out of your batteries. There is thought that goes into it if you truly want to get the most out of your investment (different charging rates, different cycles, etc.), but it has the ever popular plug and charge for those who don't want to think at all."
4,Great...you'll love it,"Loved it...good value; the included batteries are better than some of those other one's I've used as well.The only down side is that setting the current for charging is NOT that easy, as it seem to automatically default to 200 when you try to set the current for the next battery inserted."
5,Praise the Lord !!,I like this charger very much. I have others that do not cycle the batteries and they don't get fully charged. Praise the lord we have someone who sells a decent charger!! It is well worth the extra bucks to have it.Thanks again for a good product..dutch
1,"Lasted a few months, then died a smokin' hot death.","I bought the LaCrosse BC900 charger recently. It worked OK, though I noticed some inherent heating issues, especially at the higher charging current levels. Upon charging, the AAs would get quite hot - almost too hot to touch. One day, the charger died in a rather spectacular manner. Smoke poured from the unit and the 4 expensive Eneloop batteries being charged overheated and started to swell up. Glad I was around to notice it before this device burned my house down. I tossed this dangerous thing in the garbage (once it was completely cooled, of course). I went back to the plain-jane Sanyo wall charger I used before.Fifty bucks is a lot of money to spend on a battery charger. Paying this kind of dough is even more of an insult when the device presents a safety hazard. Avoid this charger."
3,Okay....I guess,"I heard good things about this. Having used it for the last month, I have mixed feelings about its quality.It's very easy to use and has a nice graphic interface. It's small, conventient and came with all the accessories I could even think about using with this thing.On the other hand, I've noticed DECREASED longevity from my AA batteries. I use them only for my xbox 360 wireless controllers. Since going to the Lacrosse charger from my old, run of the mill radioshack unit, I've noticed less overall useability. When I first got this unit, I went ahead and did a ""discharge refresh"" action on all my batteries, 4 batteries at a time. This is supposed to remove the ""memory"" attained by the batteries after months of ""dumb charging"" with the old unit I had. Basically, it'll deplete the batteries store of energy and rebuild it from scratch, giving it a full capacity that is true.Well, did that. I notice less performance out of them afterwards. Oh well, can't win 'em all I guess."
5,I love it! Great charger,"I've run a few sets of batteries through this charger so far, and it seems great. I wanted a charger that I know is charging each cell individually. I had a maha MM204 for years that I've trusted, but it charges in pairs of cells. This charger allows me to throw in any combination of batteries and not worry about it. I'm going to have to read the instructions to figure out what the buttons are supposed to do. I definitely love all the features it has and the info it provides on how well the batteries are taking a charge. I may buy another so I have one upstairs for the kids toys and one downstairs in my shop."
1,NOT WORKING,Inserted my charger to charge after reading the manual fully and recognized that the numbers on the screen continually flashed. After consulting the handbook i recognized that apparently the power adapter of the new unit that i bought was defective...lucky me..have to try to get a replacement and i don't live in North America...stuepssLa Crosse Technology BC-9009 AlphaPower Battery Charger
3,home battery charger (non automotive),It charged very good but seems to be complicated to use! It needs to set to the battery type you are using and not all people can understand that!
1,complete crap,"This is a complete waste of money. Charger ran for 3 days and 'Select' buttons 2 and 3 are now permanently depressed. Never over heated and used as directed, just poor design and build quality."
3,Does not charge D-Cells,"this charger seems good, the package was nice, etc. It's important to note that the adapters allow you to use a AA cell in a spot where a D cell should go - a pretty bad idea, as the capacities are very different.Nice charger, but it doesn't charge C or D cells."
4,Haven't used charger just the batteries,"I just want to write a review. The batteries work fine, no problems there, I just haven't gotten around to using it yet. My other Sony charger is still working fine and until that goes or I get it around to switching up. I bought the La Crosse because it was supposed to be the best and I wanted the best and well... I'm guessing it is. It looks great and fancy...update... i still don't completely understand this thing. I just put batteries in it and charge."
1,Disappointing and overhyped,"I received this after seeing all the positive reviews (but now I wonder if there's not a bit of ballot box stuffing by a low-paid overseas crew of comment producers). When I first tried charging the batteries, one registered as ""null"" ...bad start. After one initial charging cycle, I used the three remaining batteries, and they ran down in normal fashion. When I attempted to charge those, each registered with a ""null."" Apparently they are now unchargeable. Well, after reading the details of a workaround explained elsewhere on this amazon page I wondered, ""what sort of product necessitates a workaround using a paper clip when a completely drained battery happens.""Suffice it to say, a return is in order."
2,"Not sure how to charge AAA batteries, they seem too small","Not sure how to charge AAA batteries, they seem too small. There is no support or documentation available. Can anyone help?"
1,Does not charge C or D batteries,"I know, I know, it said it was a AA and AAA charger. But it also said it came with 4 C and D adapters. Now since I thought this was a battery charger, I assumed that they meant it came with 4 C and D adapters that would make it so you could charge these batteries on this AA and AAA charger. That is not what they meant. They meant you could put AA's in these adapters and they would work where you normally would need C or D batteries. It cost me money to send it back because of the misleading advertising. It also is NOT a universal battery charger if it will not charge C or D batteries."
3,Quality Issues...,"I have used the La Crosse Chargers many years both units failed a year ago and were replaced with one unit 10 months ago and a second unit 3 months ago. Now both of the replacement units have failed. One will not detect batteries and just keeps rebooting itself the other has lost the charging circuit in the third battery slot.Greatly disappointed in what was one a quality unit. I have to replace both of these charges now what I can tell you is I will stay away from the La Crosse units, the reliability is just not there."
1,My Unit Was Unsafe,I bought this charger a year or so ago and charged about 6 batteries with it (I was in the process of using up all my alkaline battery before switching over to re-chargeables). Plugged this unit in with 2 eneloop batteries and came back to find the unit smoking. Quickly killed the power to the unit. Just wanted to warn everybody of the safety concerns that might exist with this charger.
5,The best charger I have ever used!!!,this is the best charger I have ever used and its features surpass anything I have ever seen (in a charger that is). A must buy for anybody who uses a lot of AA or AAA rechargeable NiMH batteries. The battery drain and recharge feature is awesome. Buy it...
3,More a computer then a charger,"I've bought this charger to charge 10 batteries and maintain them in a good condition. 8 of those 10 batteries came with the charger itself. Of course they were the first ones I tried to charge. IT appeared that even after using ""refresh mode"" the best of those 2000mAh battaries can do only 1800. The others were much worse. Same about AAA ones - they barely reached 500.I'm actually not a ""pro"" who maintains dozens of rechargeable battaries, so most probably this charger is not for me. I'll keep it and use just like any other charger, even knowing that it can do more. If you don't know much about how battaries work probably you don't need this charger - it will be more confusing then usable. Try to get something cheaper. People who use lots of batteries will probably find this device more useful.And the last: the quality of the bag and the adapters is unexpectedly low comparing to the quality of the charger itself."
4,A nifty charger,"All the numbers and information give me a better sense of security that the charger knows what it's doing than the black box, 1 led type chargers."
1,If you value your life don't buy it,"Today, after a few months of light use the Lacrosse BC-900 charger caused a major meltdown. Fortunately, I caught it in time before it started a fire, it had heated the 4 eneloop AA batteries so hot they scalded my finger and I quickley unplugged the wire from the back and used a back of a plastic comb to pry the frying hot batteries. The 4 LCD's were still reading 200 after nearly a day, usually it switches off and they say full, after an overnight charge. I would stay away from Lacrosse after this scary experience."
1,Could have burned my house down,"Purchased a Lacrosse Charger mainly for charging batteries for my kids toys. First few months it worked fine. One day I plugged it into the same wall socket I always used for it, put in the Lacrosse Batteries that came with it and let it do it's thing. 20 minutes later I smelled something burning. Found out the smell was the charger. The screen had gone half black, the batteries inside it were swollen and extremely hot, too hot to touch, and the charger had melted under the batteries. The tray part of the charger where the batteries go had swollen, melted and warped. I contacted Lacrosse, and no response as of yet, so we will wait and see. I will update my review when I hear from LAcrosse support. Until then, I cannot give this more than one star since it could have burned my home down."
4,"Smart Charge, But Use It With Caution","Just want to be fair. This is a smart charger, but does have the same design flaws as some other chargers. With the new large capacity batteries, it is too small and it is open to heat issues. As a fast charger (most users use it this way), the heat can build up so quickly and the heat can melt the charger or cause the explosion.To be safe and to be good for the batteries, use the lowest charge current the charger recommends. Monitor the batteries often and take out anyone that is too hot to touch.This is comparable to the Maha 9000 charger. That one is large and safer, but this one is more portable."
3,Hard to understand,"Seems to work well, but no instructions beyond the short pictorial on the side of the box. I hope I'm using it right."
3,Busted,"A great price, but the build quality reflects it. The number 3 compartment key is permanently depressed. Why are the English instructions for this (and $1500 cameras, for that matter) not written by a native English speaker? They seem to be an afterthought.It comes with carrying case, which is very nice."
5,Great for Wii controllers and cameras,"We use this to recharge our Wii controllers, it has done what is expected. I had other batteries I suspected were dead, and this device confirmed that they were bad cells.Good gaget to have for AA alone. This only charges 4 at a time, but can do either AA or AAA.Glad to have it."
4,Nice for the price,"I chose this charger over the powerex smart charger MH-C9000 due to price. This charger at 40 some bucks seemed like a no brainer when compared to the powerex MH-C9000 at 70 bucks. I cant say I compromised much but one ""gotcha"" was that the powerEX can do 2 amps X 4 batteries at the same time. The LaCrosse drops its amps down to like .8amps if you charge more than 2 at a time. Turns out that its not that big a deal for me. The lower charge rate is better on the batteries anyway (but its just one option you give up for the price). The screen is lighted on the powerex but not on the lacrosse.Bottom line, get this one if you care about money and not so much charging speed. If money is no object then the POWEREX is the charger to get."
3,My dumb charger is better,"This charger sure does pack in the features but it is definitely not for the casual or even average user. In short:Pros:- Relatively small size with convenient storage pouch- The C&D; cell adapters are nice to include- Has lots of features (quick charge, recondition, etc...)Cons:- Doesn't recognize or recharge batteries that are extremely depleted- Information screens are very cryptic (you need to reference the user manual to know what they mean)- Navigating the options is extremely non-intuitive- Lots of non-intuitive rules you have to followIf I used this charger every day I'm sure I could get used to all the rules and buttons required to utilize the myriad of features it boasts. But since I only use it a few times a month, I have no hope of remembering all the special rules and confusing displays it has. So most of the time I find myself just reaching for my old and slow dumb-charger that just works like you'd expect it to."
5,Just get it!,"This battery charger does EVERYTHING. It's fun to use (!) and of really high quality. I actually look forward to re-charging my batteries now! My only regret is not buying two when they were on sale. Oh, oh ... there IS a sale going on right now. Gonna grab one for my brother!"
2,Too Many Reports,"I ordered the BC-9009, and while waiting for it to arrive started reading the many user reports on Amazon, and elsewhere on the net regarding this device melting, i.e. safety issues. Please do your research, and then make a decision. I returned mine as soon as it arrived. It didn't make sense to take a chance wondering if I'd be the next one."
1,Fire hzard,"My Sanyo Eneloop batteries just had their covers melted off. Batteries too hot to touch, had I not been aware I feel very likely a fire would have resulted."
3,great charger missing batteries,Great charger so far. looking forward to many years of use for my battery needs. Very disapointed that the package did not come with the advertised 4 AAA batteries and 1 AA battery came DOA. Also had to wait several weeks for it to arrive. (I did not notice it was unavailable during order.)
4,Nice Charger! Good features,"it takes a couple tries to figure out the buttons and commands to it, but once you have that, it's a good full featured charger that will treat your batteries very well, and tell you how they're doing to boot!The lcd display is very nice, and displays all I ever needed to know about the batteries being charged / discharged / refreshed / whatever!Charging each battery independently of each other is nice as well. each slot can do a different task, and you can put a battery into any slot at any time."
5,Pretty Good Charger. Beware of Limitations.,"Everything good that everyone else has to say is true. I have had one of these for over a year and the features are incredible. It it pretty good at telling you the real capacity of your batteries. That being said, the button ""melt-down"" problem does exist. I had it happen. It took several months, but they finally sent me a new AC wall adaptor, saying it would prevent the problem. The buttons are still buried, but I can press them with a pencil when I need them. Like others say, just use it on the lower charge current settings. If you insist on using it at the higher charge currents, provide some kind of small external add-on cooling fan and allow plenty of air flow. That will probably keep it out of melt-down mode. (Don't use the batteries in the charger to run the fan) Despite it's limitations, I am still giving this a 5 for the features and would consider buying another. I'm surprised they don't appear to have fixed the problem yet though."
5,Doing its job at fair price,"Don't really know why reviews for a battery charger have to be so long. It does its job. Easy to understand how it works, seems well made, was sold at a fair price."
2,AAA batteries not included,I just received the 9009 Battery Charger and to my dismay it did not include the 4 AAA batteries as promised. Everything else appears to be good but disappointed it was not complete as ordered.
4,Great AA and AAA Battery Charger,"This charger does an excellent job of charging and maintaining rechargeable batteries. I accurately display the amount of power present in batteries after charging, which can indicate whether the battery should be discharged or refreshed, both of which this charger can do. Sure, it takes a while to charge batteries, but charging batteries slowly and maintaining them with a trickle charge is the best way to ensure your batteries last long. I have no complaints about this charger. I only wish it accommodated more than 4 batteries..."
2,Dangerous Meltdown,"This charger worked great for 4 weeks.And then it happened! I Put 2 aaa NIMH Batteries in to be Recharged. Went to take a shower and when I came downstairs I just thought I would take a look at the status of the batteries. To my horror I saw 2 batteries with the acid leaking out of the jacket of the batteries! little bubbles of acid coming out.I turned it off but by this time it was so hot i had to use a paper towel to remove them! after that,I noticed the bottom of the charger where the batteries lay was melted! WHAT!!! I called LACROSSE and they told me to send it back.I have another one on the way,ACCORDING TO THEM but i don't know if its a new version or not.It will be here in 3 days. if its the exact same one, I don't want it! What would have happened if I wasn't home? I will update when I get it."
5,One greate charger!!,I bought this because of the previous reviews I found in search of the best charger. I've used about a month now and out of the box no problems. So far looks like they resolved the reported overheat issues. If I run into a problem I'll update this post.
5,good charger,"Good Charger. Works nicely and doesnt heat up. ""Refresh"" mode takes a looong time. Came with decent bag, a set of AA and AAA rechargeable batteries (havent tried them yet) and adapters for the bigger size batteries."
5,Well worth the price,"There are other, more extensive reviews, and so I will keep this one short. I will say that this battery charger is a great investment even if you only have a couple devices that use up batteries. By being able to know the capacity of my batteries I can match them and more effectively use them. The refresh feature is great, and can turn nearly useless batteries into functioning ones again. A great product overall."
5,Great! Charger,"I have been using La Crosse BC-900 charger more than 6 months for my Canon A95 digital camera. It serves the purpose and very easy to use. It has 4 charging banks, you can chose to charge 4 batteries at a time or only one. And you can also have mix and match of AA or AAA batteries at the same time(Although I have not tried this one).It can recondition your old NiMH batteries using Refresh mode.The bag and the converter comes with the package look very cheap, although C/D adapters are very handy.The AAA batteries came with the product were corroded. Amazon replaced with Sony 900mAh batteries; Kudos to Amazon."
4,VERY CONCERNED recalled product being shipped.,"I read all about this charger before buying, it works like I want. BUT I was very concerned when it came with a power supply with the IV marking, the very one recalled early 2010. It took several days for la crosse to respond and mail me a replacement. But no explination, was this a recalled item? I am very disapointed my complaint to Amazon, who I bought it from, went unaswered, WHY are they shipping what appears to be defective (recalled) product."
1,Don't hold your breath waiting for a response from Tech. Support,"I bought this item last December and it has been nothing but a headache. The latest issue, since receiving a factory transformer upgraded, is the charger no longer charges. Emailed La Crosse Technologies on several occasions, through there website and have had no response to date. So, if you think you may need support, you probably need to buy from some other manufacturer."
5,#1 charger around!!,This is by far the one and only battery charger you should own. I found it very easy to use ( unlike some reviews I've read) and really lets you recondition your baterries that you didn't even know needed reconditioning. The fact that you can find out the capacity in MA of a battery and then improve it to where it should be ( or close) is worth the price!!
3,good hi tec charger,"This is a state of the art design, to bad the company's customer service is not. I got a battery that would not take a charge, emailed the 3x, they never replied. Take that into account before you order."
5,Who could have thought it's so much fun to charge a battery?,"5++ star for the functions and value. What it misses is a link to my PC with Bluetooth or USB so I can make charts of voltage/current/time!Ok, an USB link is too geeky. Refreshing all the batteries are enough fun."
5,Improved Confidence in Battery Reliability,"I use it to refresh/recharge/rehabilitate my supply of AA rechargeables for photographic use. Now I don't wonder so much whether or not recharges actually were fully successful before I take them into the field with me.I have found that a battery that won't be recognized by this charger can be hard-charged on the dumb chargers and be brought within detection range of this one, for reconditioning.With all the accessories included, I have to More than recommend getting this for regular consumer use, if you have devices in constant need of fresh reliable AA or AAA battery power."
1,BC-9009 Unit overheats and melts control button. These units are defective.,"I purchased this unit based on it's review. The unit is defective. I came home and noticed a button on the unit was now lodged within the unit. When I checked further, I found that the unit had melted the button that resets the battery function in one of the slots. From other late reviews it seems as if they have a problem with the unit's design causing a flaw. DON'T BUY THIS THING."
1,"A disaster waiting to happen. Other than that, an excellent charger...","This is a great charger - BUT - I used it only once and the button #4 sunk halfway in. The insides started melting already! See the pictures I posted. BTW, this was a V32 charger if it makes any difference.And I really wanted to keep this one..."
4,Very good Charger but...,"If the battery's voltage dropped below 0.9V,it can not be charged by the BC-9009.It can be solved by charging the battery in other low cost charger, and after the voltage exceeds 0.9V, installing it in the BC-9009 for full cycle.Basically it is very good product with a lot of features, and accessories which help you handling few sizes of batteries.."
1,Another Melted BC-9009,Write it up--another melted BC-9009. I contacted Amazon.com for a return and they told me the item was already under review AGAIN. The Maha C9000 seems to be the charger of choice if you don't want to stink up your house with a melting POS.
5,Good Stuff,"If you don`t mind reading through the cumbersome manual, then you`ll be fine. This product works great and worth the buy."
5,Well designed,"Just a great product. Does not over heat, gives you a variety of options.The only con is that there is a lot of reading before you use it. That is the price to pay for all the options"
2,Amazon ships old version 32,"I just received my charger yesterday - it's version 32 which has been reported to suffer from overheating problems, with some risks of fire hazards.Version 33 has been available for a few months - why does Amazon ship older, inferior versions where there are known to be problems ?I will likely try to exchange, but return email advised me to purchase a 2nd unit & return the 1st - seems that there's a good chance I'll get the same version again."
4,works well,I'm not in any way technical but I think this charger works really well. The discharge/charge mode has given new life to old rechargeables we had lying around so overall I'm very happy with this unit.
5,LaCrosse Technology BC-900 AlphaPower Battery Charger,"El es de muy buena calidad. Es em mejor cargador que a la fecha he encontrado.Me llego a la fecha y hora indicada por el proveedor.Saludos, . . . . y gracias."
2,Maybe simpler is sometimes better,"I'm a self proclaimed tech geek. I love gadgets and can usually pick something up and master it within minutes. I read the instructions, and was operating the BC-900 correctly, but it just didn't want to perform. I couldn't get it to fully charge the batteries it came with. One stopped at around 300mA, one at 1750mA, and the other two stayed around 2100mA for a few hours before I decided this charger wasn't for me. I've switched to the Sanyo Eneloop precharged so look for my review on those if I every get them to run down so I can charge them with the Sanyo charger."
4,good product but not easy to use,This batteray charger has many useful modes. But it is not easy to choose the mode you want.
3,Not precise and doesn't work well with Sanyo batteries,"Capacity shown is not precise as it shows capacity at entry (i.e. 2hr at 500mA charge shows 1Ah as capacity), and not what actually is stored within battery.It doesn't work well with Sanyo batteries as it charges Sanyo 2700mAh to ~70% capacity and it is not due to overheating.Nicely designed but don't trust numbers that are on display. Try first to test it with decent DMM.Maybe I got lemon but I've seen other folks complaining about it.Verdict: I don't use it for for AA, only AAA."
5,Top of the line!,This excellent charger performs well. It's quick and has many functions for testing rechargeables. It won't overcharge and ruin your batteries. I'm very pleased
5,LaCross Tech BC-9009 AlphaPower Battery Charger,This charger has been working as stated. We have a lot of solar powered garden lights and we use the charger quite a bit. It is very handy that you can refresh the older batteries etc.
4,Great charger,It a great charger with multiple settings to make sure your batteries are charged right and to keep you inform of current charging capacity. If you don't want to use all those settings and just want something that you can put batteries in a just start charging this unit can do that as well. The screen is very easy to read. It only holds up to 4 batteries at a time but only an issue if you need to charge massive amounts of batteries all at once.
1,Melts itself,"I bought one charger, had the same melting issues with the buttons and the screen going dark, sent it back to Amazon and got a replacement, and had the exact same thing happen again. I've tried several types of batteries. The charger got great reviews, but it really is junk in its current manufacturing quality. Don't buy, or if you do get good fire insurance."
1,takes days,"Bought this charger and it works, but it literally takes days to condition one set of batteries. I keep it in the closet now and use a charger from radio shack. That one works really well."
2,Battery Exploder,"This LaCrosse Technology BC-900 battery charger has an undocumented feature. It can wake you from a sound sleep.My partner and I were staying at a motel in Canada when disturbed by what sounded like a gunshot. At first I thought there was a homicide in the next room, but it turned out to be my battery charger increasing its carbon footprint.Quite a few of these chargers have melted, according to reviews on Amazon, but this explosion of my charger was much more dramatic. I uploaded a photo showing the damaged charger and an exploded battery.I plan to contact La Crosse to see if they can provide a safe replacement.We spent about half an hour cleaning carbon powder from the walls, ceiling, floor and fixtures in the bathroom. My charger is V22."
4,It's a charger,"Plug it in, charges, that's it. Not much to say but it works. I keep it on the default settings and it charges my double AA batteries in like 12 hours. Fine with me, since I'm in no rush."
5,Not your average battery recharger!,"I'll be honest, I don't have a lot of experience with other batter rechargers. About 5-6 years ago I bought a Kodak brand unit which seemed to work just fine. I used it solely at my desk at work for my wireless mouse and keyboard. When the batteries died, I recharged them and that was it. This unit from La Crosse gives you much more functionality. You can place your rechargeable batteries in it then select the mode to drain (discharge) them completely, then recharge them! Brilliant! Although I have not used this feature on mine yet, it also appears that you can ""re-train"" the batteries full charging time by placing it into a charge, discharge, charge, discharge, etc. cycle. This way it should last as long on a ""full"" charge as one should expect a battery to last."
5,La Crosse BC-9009,"Bought this to see if it can rejuvenate some old NiMH batteries. Initial charge allowed camera to recognize batteries (previously with a cheap charger I was always getting ""Please change batteries""). A few days later I got the same message without even using the camera. So I'll try the Refresh mode to see if that helps.However, it does seem to do the job. I like the fact that it tells you how much mAh was put into each battery and that the batteries do not have to be charged in pairs.Charger came with the latest firmware version (""37"") as was mentioned in other posts.Charger was supplied by Greencupboards and took a few days to actually ship but did arrive on time. I paid $43.04 with free shipping. I now see that the price has jumped up by about $10 (including shipping). Not sure why there is such a price increase but I'm glad I ordered mine a few weeks ago."
4,Finally a quantitative battery charger!,"Unlike most other chargers that just tell you a battery is full, this charger tells you exactly how much energy it took to do so, so you can weed out the bad batteries in your arsenal and balance the capacity of batteries used in multi-battery applications.Due to the many modes and options, the user interface can be difficult to navigate, but ultimately utility wins."
4,La Crosse BC-900 charger,The charger is first rate. The charger unit is well made. The instructions are well written. The charger met my needs as it allows for charging at various rates as well as running discharges. I am very happy with my purchase. Works with AA and AAA NiMH batteries.
1,Very buggy,"* It doesn't load the battery properly. The batteries are charged for 10 minutes then it says the battery it full. Then, I have to remove the battery and put it back. Only now it will charge the battery properly.* The 'refresh battery' function is not working at all!!!* Support was blaming my batteries! But I use about 9 different brands. They can't be all bad and LaCrosse good!* No power connector for Europe (230V).* The quality of the batteries included in the package is good enough."
1,Overpriced Junk,"This expensive charger only lasted me a year-and-a-half before catastrophic failure. It has been used only when plugged into a surge protector. It looked flimsy to begin with.I have both RayoVac and Radio Shack chargers that are well over a decade old, and are used regularly, that are all still working.I would avoid LaCrosse Technology products if I were you; they have a track record of reliability problems!"
4,La Crosse Tech BC-9009 Alpha Power Battery Charger,"This chager, by far and so far worked really well for me. I used lots of batteries and this helped to save me lost of money. I got my money worth so far."
4,Charged up,"So far so good.Pros:1) individual channels -- no need to charge in pairs2) digital display of progress3) user settable charge rate -- slower is better for the batteries but if you are in a hurry you can set the charge rate up for a quick charge4) Has test capability5) Has a refresh capability -- but it does take a l-o-n-g time.Cons:Just one - minor: LCD display can be difficult to read in low light. It is very difficult to read the little letters telling you the current display. Perhaps it is just my old eyes. Perhaps a future version may have a backlight capability.Note: take a few minutes to read the manual. It does provide some good information of the options and capabilities. You can use it as a ""plug and play charger"" but it does provide a lot of features that may surprise you. They are not always totally intuitive but they are available."
5,I love this charger,"I have had this product for 6 months and it has all the features you want: Charges single batteries instead of matched pairs, slower charging extends the useful life of the battery and best of all its refurbish mode has brought many of my older, quick charged, batteries back to almost full capacity.The included batteries aren't all that great, use a quality brand and enjoy not filling up the landfill and saving money!"
4,LaCross Battery charger,"How many of you have multiple battery chargers that kill your NMHI batteries. This charger is the best I have seen. It gives me lots of control and good feedback. I have even resurected a few older batteries in the special mode availiable. I only wish they made one that would hold eight batteries instead of four. I give it a 4 rating only because it is pricy. Other then that, it is the best!"
1,Fine as long as you don't need support,"The actual charger seems to be working fine, but one of the batteries supplied with it was dud. I tried to contact La Crosse support about it, and had to try twice to even get a response 2 weeks later. From the reply it was obvious no-one read my email. I have yet to hear back again.So, as my title suggests - if you don't anticipate any problems with your purchase, then go ahead and buy, but woe betide you if you need any help from La Crosse, because it's just not there.UPDATE - turns out the battery wasn't dud, just completely discharged, and this charger can't handle that. La Crosse recommended I buy another of their products to fix it! Instead I put the battery in a different charger for a few minutes, then this one was able to handle it again."
2,Won't charge some batteries,"The batteries that come with this charger are phenomenal--they last for an almighty amount of time. The one drawback I've found is that for half my existing batteries (and some of the batteries supplied with the charger) it just says ""null"" and won't charge them. Which is pretty irritating. I thoroughly recommend the batteries themselves though."
1,"Great Charger, Critical Flaw","This charger is amazing! Too bad the buttons fail after a few uses. Some users have opened up their unit to fix it, I just sent it back. I am really disappointed, I loved that charger. I will buy another, as soon as I know the problems are resolved."
2,Poor Quality Control,Got a unit that often went into an endless reboot loop at the end of a charge cycle. Sent it back directly to LaCrosse and they had a new unit sent out the same day. An e-mail to customer service took several days to be answered. Thumbs-up for the features and the warranty dept. Thumbs down for the quality control and customer service.
1,The charger I got does not work.,If you buy this unit be prepared to return it! I would if I had not procrastinated so long! I am throwing it out now! Shame on me!
3,Ok with Issues,Had to return it to MFG because of inconsistent MAH readings on supposedly fully charged batteries had some 2000 MAH readings on batteries that were actually totally dead. Have not heard from La Crosse yet as to the status of my unit.
2,"Worked Great, then it didn't","Purchased the La Crosse battery charger a little more than a year and a half ago. Honestly it was probably overkill for what I wanted - recharging NiMH batteries. The inability to charge batteries at very long voltages was an annoyance, but I lived with it. Unfortunately, about two weeks ago the charger lost the ability to charge any batteries - just shows ""NULL"" even if a fully charged battery is inserted. The cost to get the unit evaluated for repair is one cent more than the cost of a new charger from Amazon. Instead I've chosen to go with a basic charger from Sanyo. If that breaks I won't be out a lot of cash."
2,"Good in theory, but faulty","I received my first unit without some components so Amazon shipped another. The second unit appeared to work fine, except the charging cycle was measured in days, and not hours! In addition, I found that some used batteries would not register as inserted until I charged them in a standard charger first, a very odd requirement.I contacted Amazon to get a replacement. They wrote - ""As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement.""So it appears that Amazon is getting too many back. I'd avoid this product for a while."
3,It is okay - Shipping time was unacceptable,"Rechargeable batteries are rechargeable batteries. BUT, after placing the order, status showed this thing just sat in some post office somewhere when it could have been on its way to me. I will not be relying on Amazon in the future. Everyone else gets merchandise on the way quickly. Amazon keeps it sitting around."
1,Recalled product,I have been wanting one of these for years.Recently the price was the lowest all year so I orders.When I got the item I checked the power adapter and it was the recalled unit IV.It is too bad La Crosse cares little for it's customers.I am sending it back. Amazon is great for making the return easy.
5,Looks daunting but isn't.,Great little battery conditioner. My batteries are all happy now! Revived some old ones on the refresh cycle. Some couldn't be resurrected -- what a life to be able at last to finally find out which ones those are!!
3,not all there...,"Just received the Alpha Battery charger, looks good except that the claimed ""batteries included"" is not true- no batteries were with the package at all..."
4,Good Buy,I have not had this product long enough to give it a full review but it was definitly a good buy for the money
4,"Great charger, batteries need refreshing out of the box","The charger seems to work great. Especially great to see it refreshing batteries to optimal capacity.The included batteries however, could use better QC. All but one needed a cycle in the refresh mode to get anywhere near their rated capacity."
4,Great charger for NiMH,"Great Charger for NiMH batteries. You can mix and match AA and AAA. You can charge, discharge, test each battery. Gave it 4 stars because I wish the price was a little cheaper. Never thought I would be spending $50 for 12 AA batteries. This product has received good reviews otherwise on the internet."
4,Second time around was the charm,"Bought this on Dec 22, and received ver 32 (the older one) with 2000/700 mAh batteries. Charger stations 1&2 did not work correctly, so I returned it to Amazon. I got ver 33 with 2400/800 mAh batteries as a replacement, so now I'm happy. Deducted one star for getting ver 32 and being defective. Great customer service by Amazon in handling the replacement. A great battery charger and I expect to revive many ""dead"" rechargeable batteries that I have."
5,"If you have rechargables, you need this item","Nlee the engineer has a detailed post about this unit and it's nearest competitor the MH-C9000 by Maha. There is really no need to expand any further other than to say if you have more than a handful of rechargeable batteries the BC-9009 is a must own item.I have two BC-9009 and one MH-C9000 and my ""go to"" charger/analyzer/refresher are the BC-9009's. They are faster and in my opinion slightly more accurate than the MC-C9000.This unit comes on sale a few times a year, when it does make sure to get one or two!!!"
5,Best. Charger. Ever.,"I bought this charger to replace one that came free with rechargeable batteries... the two features I wanted were:1) The ability to charge batteries independently (a lot of chargers require charging in pairs)2) An indicator that the battery is dead.This charger does that and sooooo much more. I haven't used most of the features, and I'm sure they're outlined in other reviews so I won't go into detail, but I imagine anything you want to do, you can.I've had this for a year or so now, and never had any problems. I recommend it to anyone whether or not they're thinking of buying a charger. If they even cough in a way that sounds like they want a charger, I'll recommend it. It's that great."
4,"Best charger I've found yet, but not perfect","I've used this charger for the past few months and like it a lot. It has been able to re-juvinate some cells that could hardly hold a charge. Having 4 independent charging circuits for each battery is definately a must. One thing that is a little odd is that the wall power adapter outputs 3 volts into the charger, it is a great switching power adapter (although a little large), but you can't plug the charger into a 12v source like a car lighter. Also, it comes with some plastic adapters that allow you to put AA rechargable batteries in a D or C sized shell, this can be handy, but the charger doesn't charge C or D size batteries. The desciption of the plastic shells had made me think it might have been possible. Its a good charger. I just wish it could work in the car, maybe I'll make my own power adapter for it."
4,Very Cool Product,I have 11 or 12 sets of AA cells (4 cells each set). I was getting frustrated that I'd put a fresh set of 4 into my digital camera to have it indicate Low Battery. It always seemed that one of the four batteries was low. I have not had this problem since getting this charger ... it treats each cell individually even telling you how much energy is put into each battery. I really like the variable charge rate and I'm sure I be using the TEST Battery mode too.
5,Very handy device,"After using this for a few weeks I highly recommend it. The ability to refresh your batteries is huge - you'll find after owning this that even brand new batteries out of the box typically have some, and in some cases considerable ""memory"" - nowhere near their full capacity. Using refreshed batteries in high-drain devices like digital cameras is a night and day difference.The link doesn't reveal very well that it comes with 4 AA and 4 AAA batteries plus 4 containers to make an aa work in a C or D sized device - considering a pack of 4 batteries is typically 10 bucks a piece anyway, the charger itself is only costing about 20. I'm happy with this product."
3,"BC700, BC900,BC9009 or Eneloop power pack","The BC700 alone with shipping comes to $35. For $7 more one gets 4AA, 4AAA, 4C sized spacers, 4D sized spacers, a bag and a better function charger in BC9009. It is a easy decision to make.Right now BC9009 is available on Amazon for $42. That price is comparable to the Eneloop power pack at $45. This is difficult to choose between1> Eneloop - one of the two batteries in US that are made in Japan (along with some Sony), not China bundled with basic charger. The batteries are great and define the category of LSD. Costco sometimes has the power pack bundle for way lower.2> A great charger that has just been recalled BC900 and replaced by BC9009. Apparently one of the user in the forums below was told that the only difference in the two is the color! Assuming La Cross has rectified the problem it still gives you unparalleled functionality and average batteries for a bargain.[...]Recall email by Amazon is posted here[...]"
