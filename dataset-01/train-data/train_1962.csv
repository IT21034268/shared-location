3,"Great information, problem with sound","This is some of the best information a person could use, however the decision to use side-by-side video frames with audio from both was confusing to me. The videos captured the difficulty in caring for aging parents very well but some important information could be lost while viewing. I bought this DVD to share with family caregivers and while some will be able to appreciate the info, others will not. Also, if anyone is easily offended by swear words, be aware that the ""f"" word is used at one point in the film."
5,Good Technical Book,"Although I am still a novice user, I found that this book will improve make my knowledge/skills even better. If you are serious to deploy Linux, buy this"
2,"Good primer for beginners, but will not get you all the way!","If this was the only book on Linux, you would eventually figure out how to get a server working, however your server would not survive long in the real world, the section on sendmail is poor, and any real ""issues"" are avoided by simply not mentioning any real world problems, there are much better Linux books - Email me for a list !"
5,Brilliant for aspirant Linux server builder,"For all of you out there like me who have read how to install Linux so many times, but are still confused about the step-by-step how (and why) processes for setting up a DNS server, or a mail server using sendmail, or a samba server, etc... this book is great. The author gives clear examples, and good advice. The book is easy to read, and should be one of your first buys if you are setting up a server. The author spends a lot of time on RedHat and Caldera, with many graphics illustrating the screens you would expect to see."
5,The Best Linux Book,"I went through the book. Every topic is very clear and well organized. I had never done any sendmail smtp server setup before. After I finished Chapter 7 and 13, I could really did it. I highly recommend this book for network administrators and people who want to learn Linux networking."
5,THIS IS A MUST HAVE BOOK FOR COMPUTER TEK'S,"THIS BOOK ONLY NEEDS TO BE UPGRADED MORE OFTEN.IT COULD ALSO INCLUDE JUMPER SETTINGS FOR HARDDRIVES, AND ADD WIN95 STUFF AS WELL AS DOS.MAKE IT THICKER BUT NOT BIGGER.KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK."
4,good reference,Contains some useful technical info but can be too technical in some places and a bit too high level in others. That is just severe not picking on my part.
1,Poor editing on a book of this nature.,"This book would get five stars,but, it has a fatal error in my opinion. On page 64 of I/O interfaces, it lists that USB 2 has a bandwidth of 480 megabytes(MB) per second, which should say 480 megabits(Mb) per second. It makes one wonder what other mistakes there are, and kinda defeats the purpose of this book. This book is to provide solid facts on the spot, when you need it. So if someone, not very tech knowledgable, needed vital data on the specifications of USB 2.0, they would be left with wrong information."
3,design keeps changing,"This replacement was the right size, but the screw holes were not in the same places as the original. What should have been a simple job became a real hassle. We've had this issue before with this company -every time we get a different door or replacement flaps, the holes have moved slightly, enough to make installation difficult. Having completed the job, the replacement does seem to work well."
1,would not advise this product,I would first like to say. If you order this product and it does not work for you be sure and return it before 30 days from date of purchase. Not from the date recieved. I bought this product on November 26th for my son for Christmas. When he returned and said he followed instructions and it doesnt work I immediately called for return instructions. I was informed that the 30 days had passed (which the date I called was Janurary 1st) I explained it was a Christmas gift and we just now found out it doesn't work. I was told I could not recieve a refund because the 30 days had passed. I feel that with the holdiay season I should get some slack. I talked with the President until he finally agreed to give me a partial refund. I am still out 57 dollars plus what it is going to cost me to ship it back. He claimed the patches even though they have never been opened are not refundalbe. I would like to hear from people who have used this product and it does work.
5,Another Provincetown tale,"See my other reviews regarding Radclyffe. She's a magnificent writer. Personally, I'd like a little more of the main characters but that's a personal choice."
2,questionable!,"Just received this product and spent all night trying to install it. After being on hold for over 30 minutes (long distance)I hung up and gave up. Finally got ahold of them this morning only to spend an hour long distance with tech support going through my computer with a techie,... still does not work! My guess its not compatible with windows98. She recommended trying on another computer to see if my computer was the problem. I asked her if other people were having the same problem, she said yes. I am now on my way to return this product and either wait for them to fix their software or look for a different product."
2,Worst. Design. Ever.,"While the Logitech Quickcam Pro 3000 is a pretty good webcam from an image quality perspective, the design is nothing short of horrible. The cam itself is an orb which sits on top of a cheap plastic stand. The cam is fixed to the stand by a thin plastic tube, which is used to rotate and adjust the camera. The problem is the tube constantly pops out when rotating the camera, making it a frustrating chore to do any kind of positioning. Overtime the hole in the base becomes stripped and the plastic tube may break. It's just plan bad.Outside of the design, the image quality is pretty good. Nothing that cannot be found in cameras for half the price from Creative. The built in USB microphone is also a plus.Overall it's not a good camera for the price and the cheap design ensures it will not last long. Avoid it."
2,Have to adjust the colors constantly,"I have had problems with the auto color adjustment. The gain is always too dark or too bright. I have to set it manually to get the colors right, otherwise, the colors are too intense and not right."
2,Extremly blurry and doesn't mount well AT ALL,"If you want to chat to people over the net, i guess its passable if you don't care if they can see your well.It is USELESS for taking pictures, as they well be so blurry they will be nearly useless.Its quite a cheap camera, but for all but the most casual uses I recomend buying something better"
4,Worth it....,"This is my first experience with a webcam. I did do some research before purchasing.It arrived last night and I had it working on my 3 year old laptop (Win98) in an hour. That's including both Logitech software AND downloading third party software from the Internet...I was up and running in no time. I'm impressed with how this little plastic ball handles low/difficult lighting, and I'm a pretty experienced photographer.I haven't tried the mic, yet, except for offline test. If that is OK, boost my rating to 5 stars. Yes, the swivel could be tighter, but you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out to leave a little slack in the cable so it doesn't pull on the camera.If only it had a power zoom lens, built-in light, and wireless connection...guess I can't have everything!"
1,Forget It!!!,Purchased camera and was excited about those who have succesfully installed and used. I spent 5 1/2 hours trying to install and I consider myself tech savvy. I Went through all tech support and still nothing. It is going back to the store. I was using Windows ME and have never had any trouble with ME. The Biggest problem I had was the step during installation where it detects the camera. Never Happened! Keeps locking and giving me a solid blue screen after restart.
2,Good design but didn't work,"could not get it working with my dell computer system 550mgz. called there support and they could not get it working also. returned it for a refund and bought a ibm pc cam, loaded it up on computer and it works fine."
1,Too much trouble for the cost,"...I thought this was a worth while web camra, so I bought it. However... I cant even download it onto my computer! Now I have to buy another type of webcam, well if you do buy this camra I hope what happened to me wont happen to you."
3,decent but could be better,"This camera has everything you could need in a webcam. Works with XP home edition set-up went well, haven't had any compatability problems but the stand on the camera to say the least it [stinks]. It broke off because i pushed it back on and broke off. It would fall off the stand even when i wasn't there. It has no bonding and mechanical fastening to the base. but all the features are very good i give it 3 stars."
1,Garbage.,The software does not work on windows 98 SE. I attempted emailing for support and it had been 2 weeks and no response yet. They must be overwhelmed with emails and calls about how terrible their product is. I bought this camera to send video emails and that program does not work. All in all the product is garbage go another way.
1,"Doesn't work, waste of money","The Software (both released and updated off the web site) wouldn't install on Windows 2000. The tech support is by email, and is miserable (2-day response time). Followed the directions given me by tech support, and broke Windows so badly had to reinstall a ""clean"" copy (which trashed all my other programs, which then had to be reinstalled). Two days wasted fixing my machine."
4,Cheap solution for the stand problem...,"The Logitech Quickcam Pro 3000 is a great webcam--great picture quality, great feature package (I find the motion detector and built-in mic particularly useful). As noted in several other reviews, however, the stand that comes packaged with the Quickcam Pro 3000 leaves something to be desired. To be blunt: the stand is functionally worthless, and Logitech should know better than to pair a top-of-the-line webcam with such seriously flawed accessory equipment.If you own this cam (or any cam with a standard female screw-mount base) an excellent and inexpensive mounting option is the Ambico V-0615 Multi-Purpose Mini-Tripod. This 4.25 inch tripod fits the cam perfectly and allows free rotation and swivel, yet is also able to be locked into position. I'd recommend this as an absolute ""must have"" accessory to anyone purchasing this cam. With the addition of the tripod, the cam is near perfect; without the tripod, using the cam is extremely tedious at best."
1,It looks funny...,And it just sits there and stares at me like an alien orb. I don't like this camera. Does anybody want it? You can have it. I haven't found much use for it. It also breaks fairly easily.
3,Webcam,"I like the product, but the one thing that kinda bites is the fact that the camera is on a pivot from the frame and the cord, is heavy which will make positioning it difficult."
2,Short lived,I bought this camera about a year ago and it worked pretty good. I stopped using it and stored it away for a while when I started using it again the picture was fickering then it quickly got worse. I have checked the cables for kinks checked my software install and even tried it on other PC's with the same results. I just prchased the Logitech Quickcam Pro 4000 and i'm hoping to have better luck.
1,Doesn't work with XP,"Installed the QuickCam Pro 3000, downloaded the files...which took about 2 hours. I spent about 3 hours, on the phone with Logitech Support (no 800 number I may add) and the result = zip! They were unable to help, in installing this product. The cost of the long distance phone calls and the time spent exceeds the price of the cam! WOW. A rip off of time and money!"
4,Ease of Use,"I just purchased this thermometer (4520). I decided to buy it due to the difficulty in using a standard oral thermometer. I find it to be much easier and faster than a standard oral thermometer. It appears to be accurate as measured against a standard oral thermometer and much quicker. It is also easier to read and retains the last eight readings in memory. All in all, I am satisfied with this purchase."
3,Twenty clams for a case?,"This model's about twenty bucks more expensive than several comparable, with the addition of a carrying/protective case instead of a protective head cover. Unless you're making house calls, that seems odd."
2,"works fine, as long as you don't depend on it","Yeah, so after I get it, I find out it's good for monitoring a feverto see if it's getting better or worse, but not so great for getting a baseline temp. I've shot this lazer beam thermometer into my childs ear 3 times in a row and gotten 3 different results. Now, if it's that touchy, then i'm going to say its probably not a good thing for your average user... I just want to know my kids temp... sheesh... back to the $6 Rite Aid brand in the mouth for me."
2,Not so hot,This model did not work as well as the $19 model I bought later at Wal Mart. I ended sending this one back.
3,Braun Ear Thermometer,"We've had the Braun Thermoscan for several years now. It does have some really nice features.The probe cover detector is nice, ensuring that the probe stays clean. The probe cover ejectoris also nice - so you don't have to pry the covers off.My problem is not that this isn't a good thermometer, but I've never been able to take anaccurate temp with this. Not that it's off a wee bit sometimes, but I never get a good temp.How can I tell? Because you can tell when a child is hot, and I usually get temps below 98.Our younger teen daughter is the only one who can ever get an accurate temp with this, so Iknow we don't have a defective model - unfortunately, no it's just me! LOL I have the sameproblem with a temporal thermometer - so I know the problem is with me!I'd very much like to find a thermometer that's quick, easy to use - even for someone whoisn't good at getting gadgets to work for them, and isn't a mouth or rectal thermometer.If anyone has any ideas for me!"
1,do not buy,"I am looking for another thermometer. Do not buy a Braun. This thermoscan and the results are all over the place, definitely NOT accurate. I need to find an accurate oral temp probe."
2,Quick results but consistently inconsistent readings,"We bought this thermometer almost 3 years ago when our youngest daughter was born. It takes a quick reading, but is fairly inconsistent. (Example, this morning's readings varied from 100.5 to 98.6 ... hard to know when there is or isn't a problem worth bothering our doctor if we can't say what the kiddo's temp is...) I expect some variation, but two whole degrees of variation is, I think, a bit much."
1,Great but not accurate!!,"I really love this thermometer except the fact that it is not accurate! I can take it 5 times in different ears, and get all completely different numbers. Then take rectal and have something altogether different!other than that its very quick, quiet, and built well.but i had to go with 1 star, since accuracy is this tools only job .. and it fails."
5,fit great,"better then the plastic ones and these don't break or jump pins, good, strong, tough, buy, cheap, worth having keep, got two of them"
5,This is a GREAT book,"I really enjoyed this book. It is a book that not only helps you to understand what is going on in your life, but it also tells you what you should do about it by pointing you to what God has said about your problems. Well Done!"
5,Great Product!,Woeber's Hot & Spicy Mustard is oh so good! I'll buy another case when this gone. Makes a great gift as well!
5,Woeber's Sandwich Pal Hot & Spicy Mustard,It is great! I like it alot. Great price too. I think it is delicious. Top quality product in my opinion.
3,Not enough woodsy scenery,"I was expecting this to be a more woodsy or coastal environment and to my disappointment it was more city like. There are 5 environments to choose from and fortunately the last 2 are what I was looking for so I'll keep it. Maybe I can get used to the city views. Also the music is not quite biking music, it's almost hillbilly like and not very enjoyable to listen to. I'll probably use my MP3 player for these routes."
3,order half size smaller,"I was so excited to receive my Campus boots... throw back to when I had a pair in the '70's. I read all the customer reviews, a couple which recommended getting half size smaller, but didn't listen since I have boats for feet anyway(sz 10). Just got them and will have to return for a 9.5. They ARE a half size too big. They feel OK in the toe but the heel definitely slips up & down too much. My advise... take advise from customer reviews, including this one. Great boots though. Still excited about getting the right size and wearing with skirts & boots."
5,Perfect.,"If you are looking for the perfect boot, this is it. You can have it whenever to whatever. It's worth the price."
2,Boots,"This boots arrived quickly but, unfortunately, I returned them. I was so excited to finally own a pair of Frye boots but was disappointed with the quality of them. I purchased the boots in the ""saddle"" color and the stain was uneven causing the different pieces of leather to look patchy. The front piece of one of my boots looked like it came from a completely different color of leather. I also wasn't impressed with the stitching and ultimately decided that alas, the price was just too high for the poor quality. I did some research at it looks like many consumers are finding that the quality of Frye boots has plummeted since the fairly recent sale of the company. I envy the lucky people who were alive in the 60s/70s and were/are able to enjoy REAL, quality, Frye boots."
3,Too much for me,"These are really pretty boots, but I'm short (5'), and the way the boots are kind of wide at the ankle and come up a little higher than I like, I just didn't think they were flattering on me. I tried the Sabrina but the shaft was too skinny...so, I ended up with the Maxine Trapunto Harness, and another pair of regular Harness!"
2,Blackberry 8700 rubber case review,Product didn't resemble picture shown. The keyboard area was covered -- not open as shown. This makes it very hard to type with the case on the device.
1,Fair Product,I was expecting silicone. This case was hard plastic. It seemed fine but would not seal 100%. There was a very small gap and it bothered me somewhat. Overall fair case if you like hard plastic. Mine eventually broke on one of the clips used to snap it together. I threw it out and will now look for a silicone case.
5,Excellent!,"This product really works great. My husband bought me the Paraspa for Christmas last year. He was diagnosed with Carpultunal syndrome in both his hands. And was told he would have to have surgery. He tried the paraffin bath, and liked how his hands felt. He ended up using the paraffin bath about twice a week for a couple of months. Almost a year later and he no longer has any pain in his hands. The doctor said that he will not have to have surgery. It works great. I highly recommend this product. We both still use it. It is great to keep your skin soft too."
4,"Good collection, somewhat lacking at times.","Though many considered Emotion one of Barbra's worst albums, I have to come to its defense. Emotion was just released at a bad time as another person reviewed, and it was not promoted properly. It does fall short at times but the stronger songs make up for it, which include Best I Could, Emotion, Heart Don't Change My Mind, Left In the Dark, Clear Sailing, When I Dream and Here We Are At Last. The others are exceptional, but often are lacking in many ways. It's a good collection of music from the 80's to have, which is a highlight of Barbra's creativity."
1,Barbra's worst!!!,"I love Barbra, and I especially love hwer pop recordings ('70's stuff). I bought this album the minute it came out and I DO love it because I love her. But it sucks! It is so scattered and non-essential. Sooooo commercial. It is Barbra's MTV album - she tried 2 music videos from this album - her ifrst- and they are terrible. She is no Madonna when it comes to music videos, that's for sure. Of course, worse albums were coming up (Til He Loved Me, ALL of her latest albums) but I can forgive her since The Broadway Album came next and redeemed my faith in Barbra. I'd buy it for a few songs and as a curiosity but it should never be taken as representative of Barbra. Try Lazy Afternoon instead."
4,The Spirit of the '80s,"Though this album is not her best by ANY stretch of the imagination, there are several songs on this CD that more than make up for the couple of REALLY bad ones. ""Make No Mistake"" with Kim Carnes and ""Left In The Dark"" are two such songs that make me hit the repeat buttom over and over again on my remote."
3,Un álbum de música pop,"En 1984, en plena era del pop de los 80 y después de una película como Yentl, con una banda sonora de carácter tradicional, y tras el éxito de su disco con los Bee Gees, Barbra Streisand decidió volver con un disco pop a la actualidad. Desgraciadamente emotion no contenía en sí la calidad de guilty. Pero ésto no quiere decir que emotion fuera un mal álbum.Emotion es un buen disco de música pop típica de los años 80 interpretada por la mejor voz de todas dentro del pop. Alguna canción es mala (You are a step), pero Left in the Dark por otro lado es un gran tema. Además hay buenas baladas y canciones con ritmo como emotion que son muy aceptables.Dada la calidad que Streisand suele mostrar, los críticos y algunos fans denostaron el álbum...pero si Madonna hubiera grabado Time Machine, Emotion...etc, hubiera llegado al número 1 y se diría que el disco es unos de los mejores de la historia."
3,Tries too hard to be hip,"Critics weren't kind to this all-out pop album by Streisand(they said she was trying too hard to be Whitney Houston, the reigning pop diva at the time). I think some good music got passed over in this assessment, especially ""Heart Don't Change My Mind""(this lovely song should have been the single instead of the bland Kim Carnes duet ""Make No Mistake, He's Mine""). I also loved the John ""Cougar"" Mellencamp rocker ""You're A Step In The Right Direction"" co-written by Streisand(Mellencamp says he didn't sing on the record, so I guess the male vocal on this track is a sound-alike). ""Left In The Dark"" is a bit strident, but Barbra works the uneasy lyrics with her usual style. The title track is a wan, would-be rocker and the other ballads don't make much of an impression. Certainly not Barbra's finest hour--the myriad of producers tell you there was trouble at it's inception--but there's enjoyment here without anything especially touching or memorable. B-"
3,"Wide Range from ""H"" Bomb to Beautiful","This album has the distinction (?) of giving us Barbra's worst recording, ""You're A Step In The Right Direction,"" which was actually miles in the wrong direction. However, it also gives some nice 80's workout songs (""Time Machine,"" ""Emotion,"" and ""Heart Don't Change My Mind."" ""Clear Sailing"" is calm and beautiful. No Barbra classics here, though."
2,This is a mess,"I am a Barbra Streisand fan, not fanatic, but fan. I enjoy her music and movies, but find this album confusing. There are too many different producers all doing different styles of songs. There is no continuity to this album. There is a John Mellencamp tune, ""you are a step in the right direction"" that was totally in the wrong direction of the album. ""When I dream"" is so lush that you almost fall asleep, but it is so bad that you don't. That being said, this is Streiand and there are also some good tracks on the album as well. Jim Steinman's ""Left in the Dark again"" and the Kim Carnes written and duet partner on ""Make no Mistake, He's Mine"" are both wonderful songs. The rest of the album is simply stuff we've heard before, not bad, not memorable. Which is sad for an artist like Streisand. Fortunately, she rebounded with ""The Broadway Album"" a couple of years later."
1,Lack of EMOTION,"As a devoted fan I can only say that the title track with the Pointer Sisters is the ONLY redeemable moment on this album.What truly baffles me however is why this album is here at #45, and there is no mention of Streisand's classic 1963 debut album on the list. EMOTION lacks the honesty and experimentation of her debut and it has lasted far better than this, thing, which sounded dated the day I bought it as a college student in 1984."
5,My analysis of this book: Fantastic.,"Waking Walt by Larry Pontius is a novel that everyone should read. The style and detail make you believe that Cryonics has advanced to the point of working. The ""what ifs"" are the mainstay of this book. What if a ruthless corporate raider attempted to take over the Disney Corporation and sell off the assets which then would be the end of everything Walt Disney worked for? Is it too late to save or are there those that know the secret of Walt's death? Walt still has many friends and protectors. And Walt is tougher than some give him credit to be. Larry Pontius has written a Blue Ribbon novel that should place him at the top of the heap in the literary field. Only one word describes my analysis of this book: Fantastic.Review by Bobby Ruble, Author, ""Have No Mercy"" and Co-Author with Kam Ruble, ""Have No Mercy II:Black Rosebud""."
3,"Intriguing idea, inspiring man, inadequate writing...","I love the idea behind this book. The idea that one of the 20th century's greatest men could be ""reanimated"" is fascinating. And I feel Pontius captured the true personality of Walt. The old men were believable, unusual characters. And, all the twist and turns are so wild that they're actually believable. You know real life is better than fiction. But, I feel the book was poorly written with spelling and gramatical errors here, there and everywhere. Even still, it's a great story with an ending I didn't quite see. The book captivated my mind and I found myself spending every spare moment thinking about the story."
3,All But the Screaming,"This is not the *Screaming* Headless Torsos. HT is an instrumental band, without the crazy energy of Dean Bowman. Also, this album has a much less pop, more experimental feel compared to SHT's ""1995"". The two albums are so different, they seem intended for entirely different audiences, so I hesitate to give this one a bad rating. I love the far-out in general, but the amazing 1995 is more to my taste.torsos.com promises more from SHT with Freedom Bremmer (whom I haven't heard yet) on vocals."
1,the product is very small to my dog,"i allways buy a size M for may dog, but this product has been very very small to may dog. please, express better the size"
4,Much better than I expected.,"I have not found Philips products to be altogether reliable. Nor have I found Philips technical support to be helpful when I have needed it.In this case, I have to say this is the best external antenna for a wireless card in a desktop computer I have tried. I have tried others than claimed 9 decible gain and this one has outperformed those. I would recommend this antenna, having used three of these with different computers and still coming to the same conclusion: not perfect, but really good!"
4,Collection item - booklet,I bought this mostly to have in my collection. Someday may work a sweater based on a pattern from the booklet.
2,Inconvenient and doesn't last,"I was very disappointed with this armband. Contrary to the previous reviewer's experience, my ipod was quite difficult to remove so that I could use it in my speaker system or in my car. After about a month of wrestling with the wretched thing every day, the silicon case split. I gave it two stars because it worked well for working out and cycling. If you charge it with a cord and never take it out of the case, it will probably suit your needs. I personally am much happier with a different armband."
3,"Metal can be silly, but this was just silly","The best tune on this album is the first one. I really liked 'Sign O' the Times', it had great potential to be an arena rocker. From there, there isn't much else. Another Slade remake 'Mama weer all crazzee now' does not help the band the way 'C'mon feel the Noize' did on Metal Health.'Party all night' is an OK tune except for that British sounding chorus. Party all night? Right on. Potty all night? uh, no thanks. 'Red alert','We were born to rock', 'Scream and shout', and 'winners take all' try to follow in the vein of Metal Health, but missed the mark somehow.Quiet Riot is not known for a long string of successful albums, but if you like them, I would guess that you have this album already.Stomp your hands, clap your feet is as ridiculous as it gets."
2,Follow up to Metal Health,"1984's Condition Critical is Quiet Riot's follow up to 1983's popular Metal Health album.As with Metal Health before it,Condition Critical is rather weak album outside of a couple of strong tracks.Mama Weer All Crazee Now(another Slade cover),Winners Take All,and Condition Critical are the only really decent songs on the album.What is left is 7 uninteresting tracks,that keep Conditin Critical from being a good album. If you enjoyed Metal Health you would probably enjoy Condition Critical about the same.This band makes Spinal Tap look glourious!"
1,THIS WAS THE SIGN OF THE TIMES FOR QUIET RIOT.,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY, THIS ALBUM WAS LIKE THIER FIRST...A ONE HIT WONDER. UNLIKE MOST BANDS, QUIET RIOT STARTED FROM THE TOP AND WORKED THEIR WAY DOWN. THE ALBUM IS PATHETIC."
1,Their lead singer lives with his Momma!,These guys stink so bad that Kevin the Screamer had to move back home... don't waste your money
4,Very strong follow-up to METAL HEALTH,"Condition Critical was Quiet Riot's follow-up to their multi million selling METAL HEALTH record. This record sold decent, about 1.5 million in the states, but not nearly as much as its precedor. I do feel, however, that this album is superior to METAL HEALTH. I still dont' have the CD, only the vinyl, but it is great. the first side is great. Sign of the Times, Party All Night, and Winners Take All are among the highlights. The second side has 2 great catchy songs: Red Alert and We were born to Rock. However, you can't forget the ""hidden gem"" on this record, which is the title track. If you are a fan of early 80s commercial metal, and you liked the songs on METAL HEALTH, pick this one up. You are in for a real treat!"
5,"Thorough guide for beginners, excellent review for vets","Though I've used a PalmPilot for over a year and have played around with more advanced features, I still found this book an invaluable bit of spackle and fill - all the bits I didn't know, didn't understand, or hadn't learned were filled in and smoothed over. It's well illustrated, which certainly helps demonstrate the more sophisticated functions. And there's enough in even the basic chapters for a relative veteran user like myself. Chapters at the end address more expert topics, including installing special hacks to ""detail"" your PalmPilot. From start to finish, it's a good read - I read at one setting the first time - and a reference that I turn to again and again. It was a perfect gift for a fellow Palm user, too!"
4,An essential reference for US numismatists,"David Lawrence has shared with us his experience as the leading dealer of Barber dimes, quarters, and half dollars (minted from 1892 to 1916). This volume, dealing only with the quarters, has plenty of photographs and diagrams showing what the non-Barber collector would consider trivia: mintmark positions, repunched date varieties, and die cracks. Mr. Lawrence also uses major coin grading services' population reports and 1994 prices to calculate rarity ratings and recommendations on which coins are undervalued. While the coin market may change, his research belongs on the shelf of anyone serious about collecting this series"
3,A good first book,"For an absolute beginner this is ok. However too much reliance is given to the How-to's and internet for problem solving, a PS2 mouse works with /dev/psaux which wasn't easy to find out. The installation guide is pretty good, you will appreciate it the first time you install linux, but if you enjoy playing and try different distro's you won't need it very quickly. The introduction to sysadmin is equally useful at a basic level for a home machine. So if you haven't tried linux this is as good a start as any I have read, but you only need one beginner's book, then i believe the Rute Manual which has now been printed is the way to go."
2,"Inadecuado para expertos, inadecuado para novatos","Todos sabemos que Debian no es tan fácil como Corel o RedHat o Suse. Pero permite un grado de libertad y limpieza que no tiene ninguna otra distribución. Si eres nuevo en esto te perderás en cuanto encuentres un problema con Debian. Y el libro no te ayudará entonces. Si no lo eres, encontrarás un nivel muy bajo en este libro. No te servirá para resolver problemas de configuración, te llevará de la mano por las ventanas de Gnome y otros aspectos básicos. Habitualmente esto no es lo que busca un experto."
5,To the point. Easy to follow. Great for Windows users.,"I have downloaded and installed several Linux distributions (Red Hat 6.1, Caldera 2.3, etc.) in my search to find one that I like. I am also reading the book, ""Running Linux, 3rd ed."" which is teaching me the ins and outs of Linux. Debian GNU/Linux works for me because the book leads you step by step through the installation, plus it is setup more like traditional (non-commercial) distributions, which I am reading about in ""Running Linux"". Together, both books and the included CD, have me up on a simple home LAN where I can print from Windows machines, through my Linux server, and share files too. Not only that, but I understand it!Yes, Linux does require a bit of time on your part to learn some of the Microsoft type things you use to take for granted, but you'll sleep better knowing that pointless lock-ups are a thing of the past."
2,"It's ok, but could have been better...","While it's nice to have a book cover the Debian specific installation procedure, too much space was wasted on repeating instructions like ""with the arrow key, highlight 'Ok' and hit the Enter key"". Too much space in this book is taken up with these trivial instructions, over and over again, it becomes tedius to read. If we didn't have to read about hitting the arrow and Enter keys with every little step, this book otherwise has some useful Debian specific information in it. Too bad the book couldn't have been packed with more useful info and fewer instructions on how to highlight a menu item."
1,Not what I was expecting,"When this book arrived I was expecting a well produced book with lot's of hard to find photo's and a informative text, in this I was very disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the photo's are indeed special, but considering the cost of this book, the quality to which they have been reproduced is nothing more than appalling! The text is minimal, contending only of caption's. I would have given this book another 2 stars if only the publisher's had used a better grade of paper! I do not expect for all books to be created in the high gloss finsh that is so popular at the moment, only to make say that when you are advertising a book as a ""Photo Archive"" then it makes sence (at least for me) to try and reproduce the photo's in the highest quality possible.To summarize this book is full of interesting photo's of the GT 40, but be warned the quality is not up to the standard most people would think reasonable."
2,VERY POOR SPRAY DOES NOT WORK,I HAVE OWNED GRES FROM PARIS THIS IS NOT WORTH BUYING THE SPRAY DOES NOT FUNCTION I WILL NEVER PURCHASE AGAIN ONLINE ANY FRAGRANCE.
1,just a starter cookbook,Very thin on reviews and not many recipes to follow of any interest. I looked through the cookbook and it was clear this was a starter cookbook with recipes. Most I thought I would never make and the selection was a bad one on my part. It is just not an interesting cookbook of much value.
5,As reliable as the bible,"Three years ago I was baptized into UNIX by working on an AIX system. Lost in the system's cryptic commands, I found picked up 3 books. Two were introduction books the last was UNIX IN A NUTSHELL. Of the three, UNIX IN A NUTSHELL is the only one I still have. When required to go to a client's site, I double check my bulging briefcase to make sure the book is tucked away. It is my security blanket. The book is divided into sections of common commands, from standard UNIX to vi, to make. While it doesn't give detailed explanations or examples, it does provide succinct definitions. This is a book for power users."
3,"If you're a beginner, don't buy this.....yet.","If you're a beginner or even casual user of Unix then steer clear of this book. While the information contained within is excellent, it's more suited towards experienced users as it's not very well explained.Also a major fault is the incredibly poor index. Frankly, it's one of the worst I've ever seen in any computer book. Pathetic. Instead of just indexing the terms, the descriptives should be listed as well.But all is not lost. When you become used to Unix (although I cringe at the title, Unix For Dummies 3rd Edition is a very good starting point), Unix In A Nutshell is a thorough reference. Just don't plan on using the index!"
2,Ho Hum compliation cd,I don't know what other people are looking for when buying a compilation cd but I always hope to find a new artist or recording that I didn't know about and was unlikely to hear played on the radio. In this instance I was disappointed to find a grouping of old recordings thrown together with a sexy cover to make you think you were getting a good deal.While I enjoyed some of the music and voices there is nothing on this cd that makes me want to hear more or explore a new artist.
3,"Solid, but........","Very solid musically, but I think it would have been more to my taste if the drums/beat were left out. The music didn't need them and I feel suffered by their inclusion. Being a space/ambient fan, three tracks are fabulous, but the rest fit into the beat/electronica mode. If you are looking for the latter, not the former, then this would be a 5-star for you."
2,Useful but not worth the trouble.,"Low starts because the book is part of a repair system sold by a company that no longer appears to be in business. Therefore, the book references products that are no longer available. The repair information is useful but available elsewhere. Personally, I use products from VinylPro."
2,Write Your Own Historical Fiction Story (Write Your Own Series) Farrel,"This book is meant for young students, learning to write. Good for high schoolers interested in approaching historical fiction from an organized way of gathering material. Not helpful for adult writers of children's literature."
1,Not an educational book for adults,"This book is written for grades 4-6, I think. If you are a writer in search of instruction, this will not be helpful."
4,Rare Item,It's very very hard to find this item in any store. Even Eureka do not have this in stock!
5,As described and does the job as specified,I command the merchant for sending a different item than what I ordered. I was going to return it but tried it out. It fits perfectly and appears to be superior (material) than the model ordered. I appreciate the change to better/improved item but a simple note would have improved my confidence with this merchant.
3,Eureka Style OX Replacement Vacuum Cleaner Bags (3 pack),The bags were fine. They came quickly and were not that expensive. Amazon is the only place we found them....which becomes a problem when you forget to reorder and then run out of them.
2,temp not controlled,I picked up this product with the idea of controlling the temperatures in my ball pythons enclosure but even on this rheostat's lowest setting it was still way to hot. If this is used in conjunction with an under tank heated save yourself the money and just get a plug in lamp dimmer for home depot.
2,Not good for corn snakes,I bought this for my corn snake vivarium but it doesn't keep the temp down enough. Even on the lowest setting the temps stayed in the lower 90's. Way to hot for a corn snake. Would probably be fine for heat loving reptiles but not reptiles that need moderate temps.
2,Quit working,Bought this in April of 2012 and now in July the dial is no longer working so the temps can't be fine tuned. Honestly doubt I'll buy another one
2,"Good design, awful performance","I took a risk and bought this item without reading any reviews, it was definitely a bad idea. Today I'm returning it due to the poor performance.It's a great idea, easy to clean, plus you get a sandwich maker and a grill all in one. The bad part is that unless you really enjoy chewy soft waffles or sandwiches, you better stay away from this item.The instruction manual says that a waffle will probably take 2-3 minutes. After 4 minutes inside I had to take my soft albino waffle and put it in the toaster.It simply doesn't get hot enough!!!If it wasn't for the design I would have given it 1 star...."
1,Really disappointed!,"I have an older wafflemaker that has the removable plates. When I got ready to purchase another one for a second home, I found that choices were limited. I found this wafflemaker and I thought the small size would be convenient for storage. I tried it today and after 20 minutes and a house full of company, I still didn't have one waffle ready to go. There is just not enough heat to brown the waffle, no less cook it. I would take it back if the paperwork had not gotten misplaced. This morning, I was ready to just throw it out the window."
2,wasn't great,"Bought this for the waffle iron and it really disappointed me. The waffles were too thick in the grooves and you could never get that crispy outside going. Got a belgium waffle maker that flips over as it cooks, I love that. makes my waffles perfect. This ones going in the donation pile"
1,made in china,"you get what you pay for ....junk.Got this for xmas ,used once burned up.Its a piece of crap and people selling it know it"
1,like good waffles?,"do you like good waffles? then do not get this machine! the directions say to leave on for about 3 to 4 minutes but after 5 minutes the batter was barely getting doughy. after 10 minutes it was kind of a cooked but still not all the way. and the it didn't even look like a waffle; it was more like a quilted pillow!i returned this item and will be getting another machine, not this one!-dC="
3,Elite waffle/sandwich maker,The top of iron does not get hot enough to brown the product.Sandwich plates and waffle plates leave the top light brown andthe brown a nice golden brown.
1,One-size?,"I didn't actually buy these socks because there was no way to select the size. The only ""size"" shown was simply ""over the calf"", which to me isn't a size at all -- it's a length. Since feet and calves grow to all different lengths and thicknesses, one would have to be pretty foolish to order a sock with no indication of size. Hence only one star and no sale! Better luck next time, Jos A Banks!"
5,Longstreth tickles my demanding music buds!,"Intricate, fearless, melodic, ambitious, confident, catchy-as-hell, and utterly captivating. I hope his head doesn't get too big! He's f****** brilliant, though. Love all his stuff. Great to see him branching out EVEN FURTHER. What on earth is the next one gonna be like?"
4,A helpful book on a great game,"This book helped me in Street Fighter Alpha A LOT. I was getting beaten all the time by my friends. I could never beat the game on a higher difficulty level than 2 stars. (1 star is the lowest, 8 is the highest) This book helped me learn some tough combos and 2-in-1s. I mastered Sagat and was able to beat the game with 6 stars.The best part of all was totally beating one of my friends in the game without getting hit once. I sure showed them. :)"
4,Handy To Have,Good idea that keeps the bottles upright in the fridge while on the road. Lightweight too and seems very sturdy.
2,Slippery,"I thought these bars would be a great idea to stop a deluge of items falling from the camper fridge after we arrived. Unfortunately in our small fridge they don't stay in place, they just slip off unless I really firmly screw them in, bending the fridge walls . I've had to put rubber stops on the ends to hold them in place which defeats the purpose of an easy install and fix."
1,Crap!,"I purchased this (at Home Depot), and they were lit for about five hours the first night, and since then----NOTHING. I have them in an area where it get's about six hours of full sun, but still no light. I changed the batteries (which were new and used one day), but still no light.Bottom line: these do not work. Buyer beware!"
5,Fits perfect,This was purchased for a school and was the most reasonable price I could find. Ordered some for our other building also.
4,Does PC 20 = LF 20 ?,I ordered LF40 (LF20) but received PC40 (PC20). There seemed to be very little difference in a side-by-side comparison of the the LF20 and PC20 package and filter. They also seemed to work about the same in my Braun thermometer. My guess is that it was only marketing/packaging for different markets.
1,Terrible,I bought this for my son's middle school locker. It worked in our home. We both opened it. He put it into his backpack and went to school. It would not open. I thought he was goofy and insisted he bring it home. HE WAS RIGHT. LOCKED TIGHT. Unfortunately I had thrown away the packaging and the garbage man had picked it up already. Never again
4,Works well,We use this lock during business hours on what is padlocked during off hours. This lock makes it easy for employees to move between fenced in areas yet keep customers out. We do not use it over night. It is placed next to our huge padlock every evening and is replaced every morning. Seems like a chore but it is great to have one code for all employees and I don't run the risk of handing out keys to my padlock that might get lost.
4,Licorice,"How do you rate red vines, they were good and I will order from this seller again. For me I like the black the best but both are good."
1,"It's a start, but not much more","I feel sorry for those who rely on this book as their sole source for passing this exam. The book had numerous errors and seemed like it was rushed to press without being proofread. Luckily, I was familiar enough with the material to pick up the inaccuracies. If you use this book, I advise you use it in conjunction with another source of information to be sure you cover all the exam topics. After realizing that this book wasn't cutting it, I picked up the Novell Press book on integrating IntranetWare & NT and it proved most valuable in helping me pass this exam."
1,Title and info Misleading,"This book has some info you need for the elective, but doed not cover all of the topics. The test number listed in this book is 50-636. Novell has never heared of this test. The real test is 50-644. When I asked the publisher, they say that the book was written for an old test. I am very disapointed."
1,Do not waste your money,"This book is (1) dated, (2) very shallow, (3) attempts to be funny by using anti-government witticisms. I have nothing against being anti-government, but I did not read this book to get that information. I read this book, painfully, from cover to cover. As stated in other reviews, some chapters were just one URL after another (some now 404s). The Visual Basic coding used Version 3, come on, it is now Version 6. The Java, as another reviewer said, was deviod of comment or explanation. If you are totally new to the industry, this book may be of use. If you are looking for pseudo-sensational ramblings, I guess it may be acceptable."
1,Not really sure who this book is for.,"For anyone who spends much time on the Internet, a lot of the cautionary tales are old hat. (Don't give your credit card number to a person you don't know. Something that looks too good to be true probably is. Nobody makes money stuffing envelopes. You can't depend on a filter to keep pornography away from your children.) On the other hand, those who need this information will find a lot of the technical language incomprehensible. Really -- by the time you are in the league where you're going to write your own mass mailer or spam filter or the like, do you need to be told not to take candy from strangers?"
3,Good general understanding but not lots of depth,"This book wasn't to bad as some make it out to be but not as good as others act like it is. I gives a pretty decent general understanding on a wide variety of things: encryption, viruses, phreaking, a bit of hacking, etc. It also gives lots of info that i found basically useless about different kinds of scams which are basically common sense, and other things like how foreigners hate americans. Basically this would be a good book for someone to pick up that is newer to the computer underground but has a little bit of knowledge about it. But if you already have a good understanding then pass this up and get a book that goes into more depth on one lone subject."
4,Non-biased approach for beginners...,"I found this book to be pretty easy to get into, with a lot of things I didn't know about (I'm a newbie). I can see it as limiting to someone who's been doing their own research on-line, but for those that don't have the unlimited access and want to learn a little for low cost, this it a good book."
4,Great For A Beginner,"This book is a must for newbies. It's easy to understand and it's not very technical. The topics discussed in this book are very broad and it doesn't go into details. If you wanted to find out the details you could could visit the links that are listed in the book. So if your a newbie by the book! If your more experienced don't even bother reading any more of these reviews, because this book is not for you!"
1,Fact checking needed,"The book needed more fact checking, as there were several inaccuracies when discussing aspects of the computer underground. Lacking in details of true underground information. It appeared that the author finished his resaearch 5 years ago and never bothered to update it before finally publishing."
3,"Good, but needs more 'geek' detail","I found this book to be worth my money, and a little more. It explained basic security on the net and takes a nice cynical look at the gov. on the net. But, this book lacks some details, big ones actually, such as details on L0phtCrack, Tripwire and other such 'security' programs. I would recommend this book to a novice looking for a place to start. For inter.-advanced users I would suggest something else."
2,Doormatt,"From the outside the book might appear to contain an abundance of useful information, while in fact this is merely a disguise. In actuality it focuses too much effort on redundancy of useless information with the wrong intension. The book is great if you want to know locations of popular search engines or the local news in Third World Countries that no one really thinks exist. Some ideas were actually present, but were not presented very well and are extreamely incomplete. ""Steal This Computer Book"" does have a lot of potential and I hope that Wallace Wang does release newer editions of this book as promised. I am curious to see where he takes the book in the future, but for the time being, in my opinion, it needs a new cover."
1,DONT BUY THIS,"I do NOT reccomend this book. I ordered it, and I thought that maybe something useful would be in it... all this book does is explain ""WHAT"" hackers do, not ""HOW"" they do it... if you are looking for a HOW book, i reccomend Maximum Linux Security... dont hesitate to buy that one, you wont put it down! (until the last few chapters where it kinda starts getting repetitious) but it is a GREAT how book if you ask me."
3,eh its not a bad book,"ok bought this book thinkin it would be something nice to have and all some things i didnt know about others i knew already and some of the so called links wallace uses dont go to anything sad and he seems to like to misinform you all on some things it kinda cracks me up at some points in the book i was laughin so hard i had to stop reading all in all its an aight book but thats about it, well if ya get it enjoy and if your a newbie to the net its a must have"
4,Very Useful Introduction for Newbies,"A great book to give friends who have just jumped onto(into?)the net. A little too basic for someone who's surfed for a few years, and perhaps a little too technical for a *FIRST* book, but a good thing to put in a friends' hands after they've gotten the basic hang of manipulating a browser form one site to another. Also good for those looking for the darkside of things but too timid to ask a friend ""where are the XXX, or White Power or Warez sites""."
3,Not bad for beginners...,"Wang does a good job of covering some of the more unusual aspects of the internet, from the hate group sites to encryption, but this isn't anything that someone who's been around a bit doesn't already know. His objective standpoint on the topics does him credit, however, as he doesn't voice an opinion, but lets the reader decide for him/herself. An interesting read overall, but borrow the book from a friend if you can."
5,Healthy Aging: A Lifelong Guide to Your Well-Being,"This is the best Health Guige Book I have ever read! And I have read many.Dr. Andrew Weil, as an MD approches every subject from a scientific view, butwrites it in layman's language. He also explains medical testing that maybe needed. But then he does what most doctors fail to do, he explains thealternative options and lets you know whether they are worth while and howmuch they could cost. By the time you have finished the book, you feel youhave had a complete education on the subject of ""Healthy Aging"" and areready to put his ideas to work. Buy it today -- you will not regret it!!!"
5,Good Advice,"The first part of the book was a little scientific, although I understand why it's in there, but I really enjoyed the 2nd half of the book. Very informative. I really appreciate how Dr. Weil doesn't say his way is the only way. There are also good resources in the back for further study. I've been looking up and reading many of the in the book list and reading them!I'm also going to be reading Dr. Weil's other books."
1,HE'S FAT!!!,"First of all, I don't like insulting reviews. It's completely unnecessary. And, I don't think that reviews that are decisive help anybody. You can see a subject matter from many angles. But this man is fat! I don't care how many pills he takes. You simply don't eat so much food! Once he became fat, he then realized that he had to stop being fat. So what did he do? He dressed in black. Like Orson Welles. So he would look less fat when he goes on TV. It doesn't matter if you eat 77 nutritious foods or are taking 700 pills. You eat less. This is a no brainer. You lead by example. And if you keep adding fat to your system; you will be unhealthy. Weil is a very good doctor. He is very smart. But I think that you have to walk your talk. Just think about it. Thank you"
1,Nothing New,"There's nothing new here. There's no fountain of youth, eat yourvegetables, exercise, etc. etc.I knew I was in trouble when the doctor tells me that the lack of stem cell research is the fault of the religious right.Save your money."
1,Self Centered Guru,"I am so disapointed in this book. It is a lot of endless stories of his mother and tribes and such but nothing to help the average working American. I found more vitamin and supplement information in my copy of ""Earl Mindlers Vitamin Bible"" which is over ten years old. I could get more vitamin information off a cereal box. I never did get far enough in the book to find out if he is or ever was a medical doctor. He sounds like a P.H.D with a lot of medical terms but no real conclusive information. Save your money. The American Heart Association can tell you ten times more on their ""free"" web-site."
2,let me save you some MONEY....,"Nothing against the doctor. The short but complete version of the book is ""eat fruits and vegies every day, meditate/relax, excercise at least 45 minutes a day, don't smoke, drink very moderately or not at all, get regular physicals, have a good circle of family and friends to hang with, be an optimist"".I just saved you some money and time....."
5,Very worthwhile,I was surprised to be so pleased with this book. The content is logical and the recommendations MAKE SENSE. I have been skipping around inside the book but so far have taken something of worth from every chapter. Looking forward to reading (and thinking about) the rest.
4,"Good book, easy reading","I liked this book. Very easy to read for the most part. It covers the complete spectrum of what happens to your body as you age, physically, mentally. The author goes in great detail to explain how your body works and what the impact is in our body and mind from the food we eat, the environment we live and and the good and bad habits we have. It also has some good advise on nutrition, supplement and in general for a healthy aging. It definetely makes you think twice about the food you put in your mouth and how you take care of yourself now that you are young."
3,Clinical,The information in this book is great once you get past the first 2 chapters. I found the first two chapters of this book a little more medically in depth than I care to read.
3,Reading Healthy Aging,I thought it was to indepth. Not enough about how to live a healthy live style. I wouldn't buy anymore Weil books
3,Good Read,It is an interesting book. It is very informative. I would recommend this book for anyone that is more mature. There are a lot of good ideas to help you mature.
5,What the Doctor Ordered,Very readable. Very comprehensive. Excellent reference. Shared it with all my friends. Recommended they purchase this very informative book. Dr. Weil's daily emails are a good complement to the book.
5,Health,"Book in excellent condition, would purchase from the seller again. Very informative book. Good to know information."
3,Healthy Aging by Andrew Weil,It gave me new ideas and facts about aging. It could help me add some years to my life.
2,Healthy Aging: A Lifelong Guide to Your Physical and Spiritual Well-Being,"Was good information, but buried in some boring extraneous stuff. Had to dig through to find what needed. Too much background info."
2,Not what Adam claims it to be!,"Though it looks nice and the price isn't bad, the black frame is NOT ""made of high quality painted wood"" as the ""Product Features"" section describes. The frame is made of plastic...the kind you can buy for a fairly inexpensive price at your local arts and crafts store. Then, throw in the $30.00 cost for shipping and my conclusion is: This product is not worth purchasing from Adam Hersh(via Amazon). There was also a longer than usual delay in shipping, supposedly because it first was damaged at the shipping location and then damaged by the postal service. Supposedly."
4,Wonderful Meditation CD,"This CD is an excellent CD for meditation. The entire Disc 2 has been a blessing. If you have been having a hard time finding inner peace or calming your spirit...I encourage you to take time to listen to this CD before prayer, after prayer, before reading, first thing in the morning or before going to bed. This is an awesome compilation of Worship music. The lyrics are reflective and immediately will prepare your heart, mind and spirit for thanksgiving. This CD has blessed my soul and has helped me to practice being quiet, so that I can reflect on God's greatness."
5,Shekinah Glory Ministry Live!!! New Level of Praise/Worship,"Let me began saying not only does this ministry gives glory to God with musical and prophetic voices, they also lead the listener into God's Glory and that's what this cd is about, ""Leading you into the GLORY"". I was at the live recording and God really used Shekinah Glory Ministry in a way of the prophetic voice and musical talent for this cd. This cd is not like other gospel cd's, this cd is not edited at all, so what we hear is what actually took place. The presence of God showed up through the Praise and Worship ""Like Never Before"". My favorite track is on the second cd entitled, ""The Place"" leading vocals by Desmond Pringle. This song is awesome,it really leads you into that secret and holy place of God."
5,My review on Shekinah Glory CD,Want to give God a hand praise? Listen to this CD! You will feel the presents of God throughout the CD.
5,An awesome Inner Court Praise & Worship cd,"I purchased this cd after hearing only one song, ""YES"", and I have been blessed tremendously by it. The 1st song on the 2nd disc is awesome. ""How Deeply I Need You"" simply blew me away, I put the player on repeat and just let that one song usher in the presence of the Lord. The 2nd song on disc 2, ""The Love Medley"", had me crying out to the Lord. If you earnestly are seeking an intimate worship experience with the Lord, then this cd is a must have!! I don't know what to say of Elder Wm. Murphy as he sings ""Like Never Before""..... Fast forward to the song ""Yes"" and prepare to lay prostrate before Him. I felt the Holy Spirit resting gently upon me as I worshipped His Holy Name!!!Shekinah Glory Ministry has let the Lord use them to minister to the world. They are yielded vessels for the Lord, and this cd will take you into another REALM!!!! HALLELUJAH!"
5,FANTABULOS,"I'm listening to the CD now as I write this review. ""How Deeply I Need You"" is so what I've been looking for. I have only heard this one song, and I can tell that this CD is annointed. MY GOD, MY GOD, MY GOD.YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS CD. IT WILL SEND YOU INTO THE INNER COURT."
5,Praise at it's best,"As before, Shekinah Glory has put out one of the best praise and worship cd's that I have heard so far this year. The blend of voices and honest worship moves my spirit into the Holy of Holies on each and every track. My personal favorites are, Well, essentially both disks. But whenever I am seeking Gods face, Place and Yes are the tracks that I play constantly. This is a must have for everyone who wants to go higher in the Lord.Lorraine S.Trenton, NJ"
2,It was ok!,"I thought the CD was ok. I wouldn't say it was no where as good as the first one. I wouldn't buy it again, not even if I was asked to by someone who wanted it for a gift."
3,Missing something,"When Shekinah Glory came out with Praise Is What I do the whole cd was the bomb (Both). It seemed like our whole praise team wanted to sing every song on there. They took worship cds to a whole new level, I know people were running in music stores trying to find something similar that would effect them the same way (once they played it out). So when I heard that a new one was coming out I almost broke my neck trying to get it. However, once I got it I was a little disappointed. To me it was ok I like the 1st cd (I love how they have the praise cd and the worship cd separate), but know I am in to more worship and it just didn't do it for me. It was like ok is that it once it got to the end of the cd. I just felt it was missing something. I am still a big fan of them though, and will look forward to future release, just makes you a little hesitant.God Bless"
3,Not as good as the 1st one,"There is some good singing, but to me it was not as good as the first one."
1,grandmother bought for me,"My grandmother bought this soccer ball for me, i popped it after a days worth of use. The first one I got was pink and that lasted until my first full power shot. The second one was black and white, that one lasted about 20 minutes of competitive play."
3,Needs inflating,Ball arrived quickly (love Amazon Prime) and was reasonably priced. A little disappointing though that it ships a bit deflated so a pin/pump is a must before 1st use.
1,What a BUMMER!!!!,"The ball came in soft and i bought a pump to inflate it. It wouldnt inflate as a seam was broken I received a credit for the price of the ball,But lt cost me $6 bucks because I did not get credit for the shipping. A real bummer!!! I was told that I would get full credit by AMAZON customer service, bt that was not the case. They lost a customer for 6 bucks, what a joke..."
5,A Defining Moment,"I remember being in 6th grade outside jamming ""Lets Hear It For The Boy"" with all the other students. But I didn't find out until years later that she had other tracks on her cd that were defining moments. Like the self esteemed ballad ""Black Butterfly"" or the rock and roll tinged ballad ""Dont Tell Me We Have Nothing"" (which is excellent by the way). Deniece showed that she could still be relevant and produce a fantastic collection of songs."
2,A Rush Job for Niecy,"LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE BOY was an album rushed out to the marketplace to capitalize on the #1 pop and r&b; title tune. That smash hit and the beautiful ""Black Butterfly"" are the only memorable songs on this album. The rest of the material features weak writing (""Next Love""), cliche 80s synth/thudding drum machine fare (""Wrapped Up"", ""Haunting Me""), up-with-people anthems (""Picking Up The Pieces""), and an organ-driven gospel piece that falls flat despite Niecy's angelic vocals (""Whiter Than Snow"").The material on BOY pales in comparison to the excellent songs on NIECY, MY MELODY, SONGBIRD, THIS IS NIECY and I'M SO PROUD. On these albums, Niecy took her time and came up with material that stayed with you long after the album ended. Even her weakest album until this one, 1979's WHEN LOVE COMES CALLING, had some great moments."
4,Great... when it works.,"This is a great, inexpensive product that does what it says. It took a little bit of calibration to get the reticle to line up just right, and the brightness control is a little finicky, but it has helped me precisely align my scope on multiple occasions. There are certainly high quality / more expensive products out there that do the same thing, but unless you are doing high end astrophotography, this works great."
4,nice eyepiece,looks good at the first glance. I would have hoped for a somewhat nicer packaging as it only comes in a plastic bag without an ezecap on the side where you look in. probably good quality but would have excpected nicer packaging for 80$.
2,Very difficult to align set screws,"This might be a great item for the very well experienced, but the item is very difficult to recenter if you move any of the set screws the smallest amount. I inadvertently tightened a thumb screw when I replaced the batteries. I have never been able to accurately realign the center target, and $90 is going in the trash. I cannot see any reason to have such a wide range of adjustments possible on an eyepiece used to center for initial alignment to begin with. Additionally, there was so much lubricant on the recitile frame, a tiny amount smeared when moving the adjustment screws. There is now a distortion when illuminated. I am switching to an Orion with a fixed rectile."
3,Date Stamper,This size rubber date stamper is OK; however I should have purchased a larger size for my purpose. Other than that it works beautiful.
5,A good greatest hits package,"This greatest hits collection from The Cure includes many of the usual suspects (""Boys Don't Cry,"" ""Let's Go to Bed,"" ""Close to Me,"" ""Just Like Heaven,"" ""Lovesong,"" ""Friday I'm in Love,"" ""Mint Car,"" etc.) Also included on the disc are two new songs: ""Cut Here"" and ""Just Say Yes"" (which featues Saffron from Republica on guest vocals).This edition of Greatest Hits also includes a bonus disc of acoustic renditions (the disc is titled Acoustic Hits). This disc includes acoustic versions of the eighteen songs that appear on the first disc. For the most part, the acoustic arrangements stayed very true to the original arrangements. Hearing these acoustic verisons is a refreshing change of pace; however, ""Wrong Number"" was a disappointment (it's the kind of song that really doesn't lend itself very well to an acoustic arrangement).This is a very solid greatest hits album. This would definitely work as a good introduction for people who may not be as familiar with The Cure."
3,"Ok, so the first disc is a waste...","...but the acoustic version is worth a buy on its own, and if Smith claims they're not a good acoustic band, then he really has lost his nuts. They're a lot better than many bands I've heard who prove that studio tampering does not talent make. Bollocks to it being a bad album; you critics obviously have no taste.And it's a whole lot better than that junk they just released. Spend your money on this instead of that drivel, and at least you'll be pleasantly satisfied instead of embarassed and mortified and praying for it to stop."
4,An end to the contract,"Ok here's the deal for those of you who are blowing this collection out of the water. Bloodflowers was the final studio album due on the contract. Bloodflowers and the accompanying tour was going to be the good bye from Robert and the boys. The tour went so well, and Robert and the boys had so much fun, that the last word was rumored to be....it's NOT the end. The catalog of Cure songs was only to be available for two years past the end of the tour. It was more the record companies idea for this Greatest Hits collection, and Robert did what he thought best under the constraints upon him.I'm not overjoyed with this collection, but do like that they were all remastered, and I think the bonus disc is pretty good. Accustic versions of all the songs, name one other band willing to do that?"
5,Ideal Cure album for beginners...,I've read some of these reviews and feel this album is underrated. It's an ideal start if you don't own any of their albums. The track listing is fine! You can only fit so many songs on a single disc!
2,BUY IT FOR LESS,"I gave this 4 stars originally, but I have to re-rate it. The acoustic disc is unecessary, and sorry, but the material The Cure has been putting out the last few years is really disappointing (to me at least...same thing with U2 and Smashing Pumpkins). I don't feel it deserved to be on this set. Plus they left out a few older, great songs so that there could be room for those newer, mediocre ones. It's just my opinion, and if any of you want to buy it for less AND get it in just a few days, I'm putting my copy up for sale on this site as of today."
2,Somewhat pointless..........,"Want a greatest hits by the cure, get staring at the sea. What the cure really need to do and I am sure they will .........eventually is put out a double disk b-sides compilation. Until this happens I don't see the need to spend on any cure compilations."
4,I Still Like the Early Cute Best,"I quite liked the early albums from The Cure, but somehow lost interest in them along the way. Now I thought it could be interesting have a collection of the hits from their long career.Though many of the hits from after ""Seventeen Seconds"" are quite nice, only few are more than just that.For me the stand-outs on this collection are the early songs ""Boys Don't Cry"" and ""A Forest"" along with later hits such as ""Friday I'm in Love"" and ""Cut Here"", which reminds me a lot of Jarvis Cocker and Pulp.The bonus CD of re-recordings perhaps does not add very much to the Cure history. The arrangements are very simple and not very varied. Still interesting to hear these newer versions, which reveal which songs are really good and which are less significant.Though nice enough, this collection has not changed my impression that The Cure were best on their first couple of albums."
2,"Ehhh, it's ALRIGHT...","The Cure is a versatile and unique band whose history spans the many different styles that they exemplify. Saying that, this disc is kinda blah at best. The fact that several key songs were left off this disc to make room for a few tracks from the ""Wild Mood Swings"" album is simply astounding, not to mention the fact that it appears that they completely left out ANY tracks off of ""Bloodflowers""!The second disc with acoustic versions of all the tracks on the first disc is also blah at best. The edge and drama are missing, leaving a Vegas lounge feel to them.If you wish to check out a truly good Cure ""greatest hits"" disc, get either ""Staring At The Sea"" (singles 77-87) or ""Galore"" (singles 87-97), in that order."
2,The Cure Greatest Hits (The Cliff Notes Version),"""Greatest Hits"" is really the Cliff Notes version of the band's two vastly superior compilations: ""Staring at the Sea"" and ""Galore."" You're better off getting those two discs than spending your cash on this one, even with the bonus disc of acoustic tracks which feature the Cure at its most perfunctory. For the diehard fan, the flaws are obvious: it completely bypasses the ""Pornography"" LP, neglects ""Hot Hot Hot,"" and omits ""Pictures of You."" There's no ""Catepillar,"" ""Killing an Arab,"" or ""Fascination Street."" Getting back to the live disc, it's pointless and the songs are done without passion. It's as if a covers band filled in for them in the studio and did the songs. If the record label had to include a second disc, it should have been a collection of b-sides such as obscure cuts like ""Harold and Joe"" or ""Fear of Ghosts."" All in all, this disc is a missed opportunity and should be avoided by first-time listeners of the Cure."
2,absolute drivel from an amazing band.,"Unfortunately, this is not the album to give you a retrospective of The Cure's greatest hits. It is an abysmal repackaging of 2 of their other compliations, with many of their signature songs left off. Plus, the Acoustic versions of the 'hits' are atrocious. They are dry, uninspired, and plain hard to listen to. Look to The Cure's other albums (all of them - except for this one) and you will find a truly astonishing band. Don't let this album ruin them for you."
3,"Yeah, another greatest hits","Don't get me wrong, I love The Cure -- so much so that I already have two or three versions of most of these songs on other releases. I bought the disc for the ""unplugged"" versions and the two new songs (and for complete-ness of my Cure collection). I'm sorry I did.Hardcore Cure fans that already own these songs: find the MTV Unplugged songs (on the ""Play Out"" video, ""Unplugged and More"" soundboard-recorded CD, and/or ""Razor Rare Live vol. 4""). They are much more inspired and unplugged than this bonus disc. If you can find singles or mp3 versions of the two new songs as well, no need to fork out money for this release -- and with the singles you will get the b-side, ""Signal to Noise"", not included anywhere on these two discs.New to the Cure? Get the previous 2 ""Greatest Hits"" discs (Standing on a Beach/Staring at the Sea and Galore), that'll give you a summary better than this one.I'm hoping this was a plot to get rid of Elektra and not the longtime fans..."
3,Good Collection But You Can Do Better,"I'd have to recommend the two previous collections, Standing on the Beach and Galore, over this one. First, the bonus CD here is not terribly strong -- I was hoping for a ""Cure Unplugged"", but instead the Cure gave us basically the identical arrangements done acoustically, and it would have been more interesting had the work gone into arranging the songs specifically for the acoustic versions. Second, there are many gems left out from the original collections. Also, the new singles aren't nearly as strong as the old stuff. Hope the Cure give us a little more effort on their new record label. In the meantime, you can't go wrong with the earlier singles CD's, which are among my very favorite CD's. Robert Smith is one of our most poetic lyricists, and the music still rocks."
2,"CD1: repackaged, CD2: *yawn*","As the owner of over 60 cure CDs, of course I had to add this to my collection. Now, I wish I'd spent the (money) on something worth while.CD1: Been there, done that.CD2:It's always good to hear familiar songs done in a different way. BUT, there is just NO soul in any of these recordings. I swear I can hear Robert yawning in many of these songs. It's just plain painful to listen to. If it's not clear, these 'unplugged' songs are NOT the same as the absolutely beautiful ""MTV Unplugged"" session (not commercially available).Note to Robert: you don't have to e-n-u-n-c-i-a-t-e to the point of speaking the words my friend.Note to Cure fans: Don't purchase this only to ruin your impression of this otherwise great group.Note to Cure curious: Investigate ANY other Cure CD."
3,"Why Robert, Why?","As much as I love the Cure, I can't help but be thoroughly disappointed by this Greatest Hits CD. The title is absolutely off (Check out STARING AT THE SEA for a better one), and it doesn't reflect most of the Cure's best work. I stopped listening to the Cure after WISH, took a hiatus, and then this year, bought all the CD's I've missed since then (Wild Mood Swings, Bloodflowers, etc.). I think they've stopped growing --what i mean is, that they are no longer the Cure i used to listen to: rich with brilliant, haunting melodies; wonderful, insightful lyrics, and great beats!!! Don't get me wrong, some new songs are still great (i.e, WATCHING ME FALL, etc.) but I think they need to go back to their roots a little, just to give their new stuff some heart.This new CD is just a rip-off really, but I did dig the so-called ""unplugged"" version of the songs. Oh Robert, what's wrong?"
3,Don't Get Me Wrong,"Don't get me wrong, I love The Cure but this collection falls short. Since I am a fan I already had all but two of these songs from their original albums and the bonus acoustic disc isn't that great (even Smith admits in an interview that The Cure isn't a great acoustic band but some suits wanted to have it added, you know popular acoustic performances are lately). Essentially this money goes to purchasing two songs: Cut Here (which I love) and Just Say Yes (which is a good Cure song too but not one I enjoy as much as the other new song). It all comes down to how much you want to own the missing songs (if you're a fan) or if you're new to The Cure. If you're new this might be the place to start, but I'd still recommend getting the standard one disc version without the acoustic performances and saving your money."
3,worth it for the second disc,"Lord knows the world doesn't need another greatest hits of the Cure CD. But if you know the songs well, and you like the Cure, the acoustic versions on disc 2 are worth getting the package for... The best songs on the disc are ""A Forest"" ""The Walk"" and ""The Lovecats."" Mind you, I don't really care much for what they did after Disintegration, so the last third of the disc leaves me cold. But the arrangements are pretty cool, and not a travesty like when the Police did ""Don't Stand So Close to Me '86"" (I hold grudges, sue me.)The one thing about the disc that is borderline annoying is the inclusion at the beginning of every song of the drummer counting out the beat with his sticks like some pretentious high school band."
1,"another ""filler"" album","robert smith and the cure have really turned into a pathetic bunch. only 3 years and 11 months after GALORE, we are expected to buy another hits collection. Lets review the CURE's output - 1978 to 1992 - 9 studio albums, 3 collections (Boys dont cry was a compilation, Japanese Whispers, Standing on the Beach), 2 live albums, 1 remix album. 1993 to 2001 - 2 studio albums, 2 live albums, 1 live EP, 1 instrumental cassette, 2 hit collections, and handful of tracks for movies. the cure are the next rolling stones. pathetic."
1,"I love the Cure but can you say ""cash-in""","Man, how many best-of collections can you release? Believe me, stick with Standing on a Beach. It's a much more consistent release and you don't have to listen to the bad ""Unplugged"" versions of the songs on it. Who wants to hear ""A Forest"" unplugged? I mean, it's not that good a song anyway. If you like this teenage-girl gloom rock then may I suggest you pick up the Joy Division box set. It's much better and at least Ian Curtis had the cojones to follow thru with his vision. Robert Smith only got fat."
2,for newbies only,"I have only recently gotten into the Cure, but they have quickly become one of my favorite bands. Their sound is unique and instantly appealing. That having been said, this album is NOT their best work. As a compilation, it is incomplete, tossing out some of their best songs for some irritating ones. The objective was to make a road map of the Cure's developement, but were songs like ""the Walk"" and ""Never Enough"" really that popular? As an album, it is too dissconnected. the songs don't fit together, and don't flow at all.The accoustic disc is dissappointing, as well. The performances are drab and emotionless, like Robert and the band were too tired to care. The production and arrangements are boring and uninspired. There are much better live albums out there.If you are looking for a primer to the Cure's mountain of work, this is your album. Otherwise, don't bother. ""Cut Here"", one of the new songs on this album, is great, but the rest is terribly sub-par."
5,Is that Robert?,"I thought it was quite a piece of work. Of course for the most part, it is just another greatest hits album (Wasn't Galore a great hits album too!?). You wont be disappointed to see some of your old favorites, nor will most die hard fans be disappointed to hear the eighties sound carried in the two new tracks. Just Say Yes sounds like two Roberts singing together in different keys. Definately hours of fun, I cant listen to the album enough."
5,Ain't No Mountain High Enough...,"ain't no valley low enough, ain't no river wild enough...to keeping me from getting this soundtrack!!! *s*Trust me, this is a soundtrack that is worth the money!!! And the movie is Unbreakable simply one of the best movies I've ever seen! Julia Roberts and including Susan Sarandon was one of the executive producers here, so Julia and Susan made ut some WONDERFUL original ideas to this movie - for instance; the proposal scene. That was Julia's idea, and the director Chris Colombus is just wonderful... He is also the one who directed Mrs. Doubtfire, and produced Forrest Gump :)A movie about two women that have to share one family, is not going to be simple. Especially not when one of them gets cancer... A movie, actors, director and music you won't forget! See it with somebody you love! This is one of the year's best!!Be there for the joy ... be there for the tears... and be there for each other..."
5,Basically boring,"The first thirteen tracks are the ultimate in elevator music. The Marvin Gaye track is excellent, but then, you could buy the Marvin Gaye album.Finally, the last track has some excellent guitar, but overall, this music should be part of a baby nursery program as next best to a lulabye."
3,what song?,hi! the song they played at the begging of the film - what is it?it's played when julia roberts is getting up too late.
4,Song Isabel sings to Ben in the Hospital,"Artist/Band: Townes Van ZandtLyrics for Song: If I Needed YouLyrics for Album: LegendIf I needed you would you come to me,Would you come to me, and ease my pain?If you needed meI would come to youI'd swim the seas for to ease your painIn the night forlorn the morning's bornAnd the morning shines with the lights of loveYou will miss sunrise if you close your eyesThat would break my heart in twoThe lady's with me now since I showed her howTo lay her lily hand in mineLoop and Lil agree she's a sight to seeAnd a treasure for the poor to find"
2,A Pain in the A**,"Bottom line is, it sort of works ... you have to hold each hairfor 30-60 seconds to make it turn loose. And one treatment won't kill the hair. Imagine doing this for each and every hair! Believe me, this is a slow, slow, slow process.It works better on thin hairs. Heavy chin hairs are immune to this product. So if you have a few thin eyebrow hairs to kill, it might be worth your time. But I would rather be washing a cat than use this thing again!"
1,DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE 1 STAR,"Their customer service is horrible, the say they guarantee your money back but it's a LIE. I tried cancelling the order 3 days before they shipped it and they refused and sent it anyway, they will not return my emails and are not giving me my money back when I don't even have the product. DON'T BUY FROM THEM, THEY'RE THIEVES!!"
1,Save your money,This product is worthless. It is very difficult to grasp a hair with the tweezers. And my fingers got cramps pressing and holding the tweezers tight enough to keep the light on bright for the three minutes. The patches also did not work at all. We (my boyfriend helped) tried them at least three times and not one hair came out. Even if the thing actually worked it would take years to accomplish the desired removal. Unfortunately I didn't save my receipt so I can just kiss the $100 goodbye. I'm saving up for the Tria laser but I will research it heavily (customer satisfaction) before I purchase.
2,"testing 1, 2, 3..","Im hoping this product will work, I just received my own FF kit. Im on my second treatment. My hairs still look the same lets hope this product will work. Or somebody is gonna get TKO! (thats fasho)"
2,"have one for sale, wondering how much to ask for it",I have a Finally Free for sale that was never used and I can't remember how much I paid for it. Does anyone have a price?
3,Finally Free??,"This system does what it promises.. Removes hair. However, the process is very tedious and painstaking. Hair in other places, however is not so easy to remove. Also, remember, this is PERMANENT hair removal. Fads may change, so be careful what hair you remove.. pencil-thin eyebrows may not be the rage in a few years.You must tweeze the hair after a treatment. The packaging states that the hair is 'removed easily after treatment'. This is not completely true. It -is- removed easily, however do not be mistaken... it -hurts-. You are still pulling the hair out at the roots.I loved this product when removing any unruly eyebrow hairs and facial hair. I would not recommend this product for any other area."
1,frustrating trial,"I ordered the Finally Free product for my daughter. She was so disappointed that she asked to write the review that follows: after using this product a year in hopes that something magical would happen- i have decided this product is [...junk]. do not buy this product. it does not work, and it is a pain to think that this product got my hopes up to permantly remove embarrassing hairs. all i have to say is, Finally Free will be be Finally Chucked in the Garbage for me."
1,Approved by the FDA???,"OK, yes this product has been approved for use by the FDA. BUT, after doing some research on the FDA's website, I have discovered that all that takes is proving that this system is ""essentially equivalent"" to systems already out on the market! I also found that, according to the FDA, there is no statistically significant data available (even from their ""published trials"" which I had no luck in locating) to support claims of long-term or permanent hair removal through use of tweezer-type epilators. Bottom line...check the advertiser's claims before you buy their product because obviously these claims don't hold water!"
1,It just doesn't work.,"The bottom line is, this product simply does not work. I followed the directions carefully, and waited the appropriate time, but saw no effect at all. As your mother probably told you, ""If it seems too good to be true, it probably is."" Once again, mother was right."
1,this is such a rip off...,"Save your money, I order finally free, did every thing the directions told me to do, it did nothing. I did not lose one hair from this product, the only thing you will lose is your money. I sent it back with the 100% guarentee, what a joke. You can't get thru on the phone, the e-mails I send get returned saying the box is full. I can't reach anyone at the company. I have not recived any response from them at all. Nothing! Not to mention no refund yet. I even returned it with a confirmed delivery from the USPS, so I know they got it back. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS JUNK!!Beth / Fl"
4,"identified the composer of the tune found in ""Holiday Song""","My father really enjoys the music from ""Hilary & Jackie."" His mother sang him the tune in ""Holiday Song"" as a child, as she heard it from relatives who were musicians. I found out from Barrington Pheloung's website that the melody was written by a composer named Johannes Fries, though it was originally attributed to Mozart. Just thought that I'd share that with you, since there apparently are others who are searching for the original music, too. The Elgar concerto is a classic recording, a mainstay in any basic classical library."
5,Music from above...,"A glorious film with very inspiring music of Barrington Pheloung and classical pieces, with Elgar's Celloconcerto as the main body. Every soundtrack of Barrington Pheloung is a jewel of emotion, musical scene description and artistry. I recommend this cd to every musiclover with a good taste and emotional feelings about the story."
2,Disappointing and repetitious. Potential wasted.,"From the advertisement I expected a wide variety of situations and comobinations of inventive techniques. What I found was only a few variations of the same situation over and over. After less than half of the rather elongated text I finally noticed that I wasn't picking it up anymore. In short, this was by far NOT the, ""Magical exploration of the full erotic potential of this fairy tale"". It is, to my recollection, only the second of a mountain of books in the erotic fiction genre that I have not found enough interest in to finish.I wish this book had lived up to my expectations. Thestory has so much more potential than was wasted in this effort. Inaddition, this does not by any stretch approach being compared to ""Sleeping Beauty"". Witness the variety of scenerios in that series. Thank you for the opportunity to express my thoughts."
2,Needs Editing,"(second edition) There is a lot of good S&M material here, but the ""story"" fails to flow well. I got the impression of a collage of bondage but inadequate characters. This could be a lot better than it is. I suggest waiting to see if another edition is done before trying it."
4,courtney does it again!,"despite the tragedies that surround courtney love's personal life, she somehow pulled off another winner! though critics constantly wrote about extended deadlines and re-written songs, the final product proves to be a hit and will certainly give her long waiting fans what they were craving. not as angry as ""live through this"" but less commercial than ""celebrity skin,"" courtney finds a happy medium between the two very different cd's giving fans a fresh new dose of her amazing rock and raw talents. definitely worth the wait! :))"
5,Wow.,"Yes. I think ""wow"" just sums it up. The long-awaited solo album from Courtney is finally here! With high expectations, Courtney has definately taken her listeners above and beyond. I definately recommend the album to all."
4,Worth a look!,"This CD could definitely fall somewhere between ""Live Through This"" and ""Celebrity Skin"". It sounds almost like Courtney is trying to recapture the anger of ""Live"" while making the appeal to the ""Celebrity"" crowd. Overall, the CD provides a decent amount of good listening. I would recommend it for new fans of Hole and/or Courtney Love solo."
5,She's Back!!!!!,"Okay. I have been waiting for a long time for this CD to come out, And here it is. I love this Album. I believe that Courtney really opened herself up for this one. The first single Mono, Just hit me hard, Then the rest of the album kicked even more butt. I love Ms. Love, And I hope this is just the first in a long line of solo albums. Thank you Ms. Love. You and the badies B**ch!!!!"
5,The best is back for you.,"This is the time now that everyone needs to take their rock medication. Courtney Love has given all us rock fans another, prbably the best chance to stop ignoring good rock albums (Garbage ""Beautiful Garbage"", Distillers ""Coral Fang"", Audioslave, etc) and get what our bodies need to listen to. We all need this record. If there is anyone out there who wants to call themselves a ""rock fan"" but has a problem listening to anything by Courtney or out of the top 40 its time to die now. America's Sweetheart is the best rock album released in the past 3-4 years and don't you deny it. You can't. Listen to ""I'll Do Anything"" and ""Uncool"" aka the ballad and tell me I'm lying. Listening to the first single ""Mono"" alone was enough to tell me that this was it. Most musicians can't write a song like that and sound like they mean it. You guys, what you thought was cool before now isn't anymore. So get over it and get America's Sweetheart and take you medicine."
5,Yes ma'am I missed you.,"In the first track of the abulm, ""Mono"", I was knocked off my feet. The opening riffs were like a breath of fresh of air from the once dormant Love. My favorite tracks (and when I say ""favorite"", I mean it as in, these songs have been on repeat forEVAR)would have to be ""Mono"", ""Julian"", ""I'll Do Anything"", ""Uncool"",""Hello"", ""Zeplin Song"", and ""Never Gonna Be The Same"". And I don't mean to say the other inbetween weren't worthy of constant repeation, because I can honestly say all the tracks on here have ALL had an hour each on repeat. If you refuse to listen to this albulm due to rumours you have heard in the past about her, GET OVER IT. This albulm is too GREAT to be pushed aside by misconstrued rumors blown out of proportion by the media, DON'T DENY YOURSELF THE RIGHT TO ENJOY REAL ROCK AND ROLL!"
1,Terrible,"I consider myself to be quite a huge fan of CL. Hole's Live through this was a genius album, everyone can relate to. But the only reason it was good is because Kurt made it good, now that her chief songwriter is dead she has no good lyrical structure left. She claims that she wrote better than him, but lets face it, she cant sing anymore. There's one song on there that is so totally annoying that I have to turn the cd off. Mono is the only listenable track, I dont anticipate this album to sell well. When they pushed the release date back, its true they should have not even released the album. Boring, asinine screaming. Sounds like a monkey, she is too old to be putting out garbage like this.. COurtney can do better, she is one heck of a singer, I dont know if she can play guitar but..."
3,not bad but not great,"Being a love fan I think that this album is a good listen. Very edgy and loud, but I was hoping for something new and this is not it. I think that it could have been better but it was still good."
2,what the...,"This is quite possibly one of the most unoriginal albums I have ever listened to, ""COURTNEY IS BACK, AND BETTER THAN EVER"" yeah, she is back, doing what she does best, ripping off guitar riffs from her late husband and Silverchair songs. Rock hasn't gone anywhere, just put in an old Nirvana or Hole album and voila."
4,if you like live through this you'll like this one,"the first moments of this cd your going to be like what the...... then as you listen to each song your going to be like this is good and the more you listen to it, your going to realize that this is an awesome cd. it sounds raw and loud and the type of cd you pay over and over it's just really good so just buy it"
3,it's no Hole,"Obviously, this album will be compared to every Hole record. It's not half as good as ANY Hole record."
2,Highly anticipated CD and highly disappointed fan,"I am a huge Hole fan and think Courtney is the best thing since Siouxie Sioux. I have many pre-Miss World single albums and have loved them all. I couldn't wait to get my hands on America's Sweetheart. Listened to it once and wasn't sure, listened again and frowned, and after the third time I put it away to collect dust or perhaps sell on Amazon Marketplace. What a huge let down. C'mon Courtney, actually try next time!"
4,Car tune Princess,"This album kicks in the same vein as Jane's Addictions new one. Hard, eighties rock with a little grunge tinge. Yeah, her voice is shot, but it was better on her previous stuff? My complaint is it's a bit too eighties, a bit too slick metal pop. At her best Courtney sounds like the Donna's with a more polished backing band (which isn't a criticism, actually), at her worst, she sounds like the drunken, drugged spoiled Hollywood creation that we see staggering in and out of the media. Do these artists really need Linda Perry? What exactly did she bring to the Courtney table Hole couldn't? ""You know, Courtney darling, you need at least one more drug reference and I'll mix in the proper glossy veneer, and we'll sell billions, Love...) I said, Hey. What's going on? Kurt would tap Courtney on the shoulder and say, ""Tell Linda to leave. We can handle this."""
5,The Queen is Back,"IT'S BEEN LONG OVER DUE FOR COURTNEY LOVE TO COME AND BLAST US WITH SUCH A PIECE OF WORK.... MEANING OF COURSE.. AMERICAN SWEETHEART.. THE LYRICS RIP LIKE THE OLD COURTNEY, WITH RIFFS TO MATCH... IT'S DEFINATELY A CD WORTH BUYING IF NOT IN YOUR COLLECTION..ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS.. ""COURTNEY, YOU'VE PROVEN ONCE AGAIN THAT GREATNESS CAN BE REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN.."
5,Great music,"Courtney is always so thought provoking and voice soft and sublte and can switch to serious and menacing, in a good way though. One of the best acts of the nineties!! Sure we will be seeing alot more of her and more music soon since this album was so good."
5,woo hooo,Welcome back Courtney...we all missed her plentay...this cd is really amazing...Mono and all the drugs are very good songs and i certainly can't say that its a downgrade from hole...this cd is amazing...go buy it...
2,Musical Talent and Not,"Like the former rate'E, I have to say that I am a big fan of ""Live through This"" and also ""My Body the Hand Grenade,"" but this new album was just UN-listenable. How old is Courtney Love again? 39-40? Musically it was not too shabby, but LYRICALLY it was pigvomit. I sounded like a teenage girl going through puberty and filled with teen angst wrote the lyrics to this album. It's chessy....I'm sorry....but its chessy. God Bless you, Courtney!!!"
5,i really like it!,"so i guess i wouldnt consider myself a huge Courtney Love fan, but my friend is, and she played me the album when she got it...and i really love it!! I think my favorite song is the Zeplin one!! i was really suprised this time around for Ms. Love...i thought i would hate it, but she actually kept my interest long enough to buy the album."
4,Who Needs Hole Anyway?,"I was a bit skeptical about a Courtney Love solo album, but the music is awesome. The first song ""Mono"" is the perfect song to open the album with and the perfect fist single. Alot of songs on this album stand out including, ""I'll Do Anything,"" and ""Sunset Strip,"" and a few others. ""Nver Gonna Be The Same"" is very depressing. One thing I must mention, Courtney's voice sounds a bit different, more raspy. At sometimes she sounds more like Kurt Cobain, especially when she starts shouting. I love Courtney, I'm a sucker for a Courtney Love album. I won't say this is better than ""Live Through This,"" but it is somewhere in between ""Live Through This"" and ""Celebrity Skin."" Despite all the tabloid fodder she is still a talented writer and musician."
1,Ignore all five star reviews (teenage street team cretins),"This album is lame, from the production to the ""singing"" to the lyrics. Lame. Bad 80s hairmetal crap. This is not some big comeback, this is a weak attempt in every way.Courtney Love is not ""back to save the day"", etc. etc. *fill in the cliche the street team is clogging this site with*. This album is so bad even the Olivia illustration is lousy (why the drawing of the late Dorothy Stratten on the cover? Why not show the Joan Rivers of Rock in all her plasticized glory with a photo?)Bad. Bad. Bad. One would think she'd have made a better album in the six years it took to get this one out.Buy ""Pretty On The Inside"" instead. Or ""Live Thru This"", if you don't already own it.But not this thing."
2,"Great Music, but the vocals lose it","I really like the music as it has to be one of the best instrumental arrangements out there in popular music. Is she even trying to sing though?? I really wish it was just an instrumental CD or that someone else was singing. She's fine with normal ranges, but when she tries to hit the higher notes, it comes across as a cat with emphezema being strangles. Although the positive aspect with that is that if she does actually tour for this album, you'll know *exactly* what the songs will sound like onstage. I find myself not wanting to listen to songs just becuase I can not take that constant screeching for the length of each song."
4,"Courtney, Chain-Whipped.","COURTNEY LOVE: America's Sweetheart (from http://www.chain-whipped.com)Argued for nigh upon 15 minutes about whether or not she was in Taxi Driver... until we finally realized we've got this Internet thing... and it was Sid 'n' Nancy... with Bill Pullman as Sid... no, it was Gary Oldman. Anyway, we found this filmography list at http://us.imdb.com/name/nm0001482/where you can boost your movie trivia skills. Otherwise, who gives a toss when we're talking about an album? This thing is all over the place stylewise... but more in like an old Aerosmith way than in a drunkard car keys sort of way....Not to say that the latter wouldn't have its appeal as well.Let's put it this way, now there's a whole whack of songs to replace the Doll Parts fragments that are still bouncing around in your head....And Courtney,Happy 40-ish-th! mmmmmwah!RS"
3,Courney Love is better than this...,"Don't get me wrong, it's a good album, by the standards of any other artist. But as her only solo album, her defining album? It stinks. I always bet Courtney would be a terrific songwriter when she's drugged up but I didn't think she'd actually do it. Her talent shines through (especially in Mono, one of the best singles I've heard. great song) but this is not Love at her best. I am so, so glad she's coming out with another album that she wrote when she was in rehab, and very early reviews are good, because Courtney Love is too good to sign out with ""America's Sweetheart"". I get the feeling she didn't put in much effort.Trying to decide whether to buy it? I think it's good enough to buy and enjoy, but don't expect anything up to par with her previous work. If you are tight on cash then definitely no. However the song Mono is fantastic with top-notch lyrics. I've still waiting for her to save punk rock, which I know she can."
5,Love Still Rocks,"From the first song to the last this CD rocks. If your looking for something like the last hole CD this is not it. This CD is more like the ""Live Through This"" CD. That is raw and rocking.This is great work and some bad words. Buy it and ROCK!"
1,What did I just listen to?,"I have been a Hole/Courtney fan for a long time, and I was so excited about this album. I remember last year when the release date was getting pushed back all the time, I thought it was just unfair to make us all wait. Well... I think this album should not have been released at all. I really did not like it. I know some other people liked it, and that's good, but personally, I was really, really disappointed.Either Courtney was asleep or higher than high when she recorded the album but she never sounded so bad. The songs aren't great except ""Hold on to me"" and ""Uncool"", but buying a CD for 2 songs is just not worth it. If you can listen to it before buying, it's highly recommended.OK Courtney, I'll forget about this one, and I'll be waiting for the next one. :)"
5,Far from disappointing!,"I admit, I was hesitant about this album. I loved Hole back in the day and miss them like crazy, and I wasn't sure what would be in store for me on 'America's Sweetheart.' Finally, I gave it a listen, and I was far from disappointed!!! Courtney screams and shimmers with all her usual, raw, electric beauty. This is a true rock record, and definitely one not to be missed. Some of the best tracks are 'Mono' and 'I'll Do Anything,' but they're all pretty good. Give it a listen. I bet you'll be far from disappointed, too."
1,Awful,"Courtney Love has lost her touch and it really shows on this album. It's messy, mediocre, painful to listen to and just plain disappointing. She's just not the same and neither is her music, something I find incredibly sad. I wanted to like this album, I really did, but I just can't get past how awful and humdrum it is. And by the way, don't be fooled by all these positive reviews seen on this site. Love's record label has assigned members of her street team to come onto online retail sites like this and write postive reviews in order to persuade people to buy the album. Regardless of the reviews the music speaks for itself. Give a listen and you'll see what I mean."
1,good to use as a drink coaster,Someone needs to tell the author of all of those 5 star reviews put up on February 19th that she needs to find a better way to spend her time. But I suppose if one is a fan of Courtney Love then one doesn't have a lot going on.
2,I think you heard this before,"If you are familiar of the song "" BOYS ON THE RADIO"" from Hole's celebrity skin, then your familiar with two more songs on this disc. Starts out strong with MONO but just dulls away with really a lack of direction. I was rooting strongly for this disc but sadly you get maybe an ep worth of good stuff. I think Eric Erlandson is needed back to the fold along with Melissa Auf Der Maur!"
1,Mediocre Recording from a Self-Confessed Diva,"Got this in heavy anticipation and was disappointed! All the songs sound the same!!!There was not one song on the CD that caught my fancy!!!I am glad that I bought it at Target for under $10.00!!!Her recent headlines in the News and Tabloids are far more interesting then this recording!Thanks for reading this, as I am just being honest!!!"
1,Mediocre,"This is not Courtney's best work. Fell flat compared to Celebrity Skin, both in the songwriting and the production."
1,Americas psyco!!!!,"Courtny love is crazy,I mean she throws mic stands at someone in the crowd and injures them and expects pepol to respect her as an artist. aww well,this album is floping anyways so maybe her rain of terror is almost over."
3,Oh well.,"With Courtney's history and smarts, she could have made an album way better than this. There's nothing special here. She hasn't gone the way of Liz Phair (Avril Lavigne-esque top 40 radio, ""Now That's What I Call Music"" compilations, teen movie soundtracks) so I do give her props for that. She still has her edge and refuses to sell out. She is still flashing people and getting arrested. Aside from the plastic surgeries, she hasn't really changed. If you are a Hole fan, I'd say get the CD. I only spent $9.99 for it at Target and, maybe it just needs a few listens to be appreciated. One more thing, why don't the sung lyrics and the written lyrics match up? She had some good verses, and they didn't make it out of her mouth. Oh well. Not a total loss. Three stars isn't really bad."
1,Yikes!,"I liked Hole, and I don't care what anybody says about Kurt and Courtney, it all comes down to the music, and this music stinks! As Neil Young sang, ""Saw it on the tube/Bought in on the phone/when I got it home/it was a piece of crap!"" Thankfully I checked it out of my local library. My, oh my. She has lost her way here. If you like retro slick metal, with a singer who has lost an immense amount over the years, then this is for you. A major disappointment. This has got to go on any ""worst of"" list."
5,America's Sweetheart!,"this CD rocks!!!! Courtney Love is BACK and rocking harder than ever! The best songs are ""Mono, Sunset Strip, and Hold on to me"""
1,I hate Courtney Love!!!!,Courtney Love sucks!Shes famous only because of her drug arrests and nothing else.Listen to Melissa Auf Der Maur if you want real rock!
1,The covergirl of Crack Whore magazine,"Courtney Love has no talent, no class, no artistic ability, and a miserable bitch."
1,trash,"Courtney Love is a horrible singer/songwriter/person.She killed Kurt (or at least drove him to killing himself)And, In my opinion,anyone who sleeps with someone 14 years younger than them and then wrties a (crappy) song about it is not deserving of any respect."
1,Courtney Love is on crack,I dont want to lisyten to a CD by a crazy lady whose kids were taken away cause she cant get enough crack or blow
2,Never Gonna Be The Same...,"Hmm...Being a big fan of Courtney Love, I would like to give this album 5 stars, but, this is a really bad album...unless you're a mindless teenager who loves terrible pop music. As one reviewer stated before, most of the lyrics are atrocious, just stupid and silly. Yet in this corrupted album are two songs worth a listen.The first is Hold Onto Me. I feel this is a personal song for Love and she expresses herself well. The other is the fiery Life Despite God. I noticed other reviewers critisized this song...I dont know why, yes Courtney wails and wails, but this song, this is Hole as we remember it. This is the real Courtney Love. Its these two tracks that make my purchase so worthwhile, giving a taste of the old Hole, the old Courtney we loved.Anyway, if you want more of the real Courtney Love I suggest you pick yourself up a copy of Hole's Live Through This. Taking you back to the days of smeared red lipstick, babydoll dresses two sizes too small and empowering lyrics."
3,DEFINITELY NOT HER BEST,"I was expecting a lot more from this cd. The music is ok, but Courtney seems to have a hard time singing at times. She is capable of much better than this. It just all sounds very unfocused. A disappointment."
5,"""Did You Miss Me?""",", the legendary rocker asks the world as she tears herself back into the world of music.""America's Sweetheart"" is Courtney Love's solo debut--and probably the best way to start out. With mind-pounding powerful tracks such as ""Mono"", ""All the Drugs"", and ""I'll Do Anything"" mixed in with heartaching songs like ""Uncool"", ""Sunset Strip"", and ""Never Gonna Be The Same"", ""America's Sweetheart"" is GUARANTEED to stay in your c.d. player for lengths to come.Five stars for the greatest woman--no, greatest person--in rock. Love is in the air, and she's ""coming for you""."
5,Courtney Love does not disappoint!!!!!!!,"Wow!!That's all I can say about this album. Being a devoted Courtney Love fan I was ecstatic when I heard she would be releasing a solo album. The first track ""Mono"" grabs the listeners attention and gets their adrenaline pumping. She is a saviour of Rock n Roll whose comeback one more time to ""save the day."" From the nostalgic ""Sunset Trip"" that takes you on a sin filled drive through sex,drugs,and Rock n Roll to power ballads like ""Hold on to Me"" and ""Uncool"" Courtney Love has once again proven herself to be a genuinely talented artist. And as she howls ""DID YOU MISS ME??!!"" I must admit, YES, I did miss Ms.Love and am so glad she's back to save us all from the terrible ""rock"" music being played on the radio. FINALLY, someone who knows how to rock!!""America's Sweetheart"" is a much needed breath of fresh air!!"
4,Good Come Back,ITs rock n roll its angry and its Courtney Love. She gave us everything she has given us in her past. The album is very passionate and deserves a listen. She is back and ready to rock n roll
4,"It won't save rock, but it's the best of the year so far","Finally after 5 years she's back with a new album, one which she promised would save rock and change the music scene. Well sorry to burst your bubble, but it does neither.What it does do, however, is deliver over 40 minutes of quality music from Courtney and the gang that help her wrote it. Better than her previous effort (Hole's Celebrity Skin), most of the tracks are standout tracks that shine in their own way. The only thing that keeps this album from getting 5 stars is her lyrical pool has apparently been sucked dry. After 5 years, I was expecting the great lyrics from her that she has always supplied. Still, the album is well worth it and for fans of her's, you probably wont be disappointed."
2,It gets boring after a few times..,This is the end for courtney love's career. The lyrics are cheesy and her singing is not as good as before. She cant even play guitar. There are some good songs in here but I think its better to spend money on other music thats worth it.
1,Cesspool of Heroin Addict Filth,"Courtney Love doesn't even deserve to have her name known to the general populace...but through devisive inclings on how to do a lot of crack, heroin and other drugs, she managed to snag a talented drug addict and squeeze years of undeserved publicity out of it. She killed him, period. And her music has, and always will be the most vomitous filth on the planet."
1,"horrible, trite, boring","Courtney Love shouldn't even be allowed to walk the streets considering how bad her new album is. I heard the single and thought... over produced. It is no wonder that so many bands have disbanded because of her attitude. Although it's not an attitude, it's a drug habit. Kurt Cobain should have never touched this beast of a women, I feel horrible for Kurt's child. Then again, Courtney could have kept dating Billy Corgan and then we wouldn't have him alive today. I love Billy just as much as Kurt. So lets just remember Kurt and forget Courtney. Don't spend money on this album. Please don't."
1,"How to use someone else's creativity, by Courtney Love","Can Courtney Love write anything on her own... First Kurt Cobain helped write Live Through This, then she got Billy Corgan to help write Celebrity Skin, now she gets Linda Perry from 4 Non Blondes fame, whom is also responsible for getting models with fair to less-than-fair voices such as Christina Aguilara and Pink to write her music... and after all that she calls herself an artist? Courtney Love is all about playing the corporate game, she knows who to talk to to get what she wants, including writing her album (and not a very good one I might add), she would have made a very successful salesman. I think Courtney should have stuck with Billy Corgan writing her stuff, at least then Billy would be employed. And needless to say, without Kurt she wouldnt have a career. Out of respect of rock music as a whole, i will not buy or even download Courtney Loves music, no matter how good it is."
3,"Not bad, but certainly not the punk album of the year","Ok, just because someone screams ""Oy!"" once or twice during a song doesn't automatically label the entire album as punk. There are a few punk styled tracks, but overall this album is grunge flavored with a splash of punk. Initially, the album starts out fairly strong but soon starts to fade. Some of the work near the end - with few exception - seems forced. I assume that this is because the first few tracks had been more fully developed before the record industry suits came along and mandated a re-working and a push into production while the publicity was hot (publicity over Francis Bean). I love Courtney as an artist - hate her as a person and possible murder suspect. I respect her work. ""Live Through This"" is an all time favorite of mine and definite Hole classic. ""America's Sweetheart"" is ok, but it will never be a classic Cortney Love album."
4,Rock on Love!,"Love's solo debut is fantastic! I really enjoyed her music. It's a different step from 'Pretty On The Inside,"" but hey, that's a hard one to keep up with, even for the boyz!Courtney, still doin' the 'Mazzy Star' thing. That's cool! Keep on rockin', punk is in the soul, not the face or how you dress. To me you're a 'Punk Goddess' that people fear."
3,Am I missing anything?,"References Courtney Love makes in ""America's Sweetheart"" (according to the written lyrics in the album's booklet).1) Being drunk: 32) Drugs (in general): 183) Rock-n-Roll/Punk Rock/Punk/Rock/Rockstar: 74) Sex/Sex acts: 155) Breaking things: 26) Crashing cars: 27) Telling people to ""Shut up"": 108) People trying to get HER to ""Shut up"": 29) Winning wars/battles"": 310) Drowning: 311) Pills: 1412) Money: 313) How she f**ks: 214) F**king people up: 415) Matches and fire: 2216) Dresses and clothes: 317) Being killed: 118) Vengeance and revenge: 3and now for the name dropping!!!19) Robert Plant: 120) Son House: 121) The Sex Pistols: 122) Julian Casablancas: 123) Larry Flynt: 124) Kiersty Alley: 1"
5,Courtney Love's America's Sweetheart,"Courtney Love's debut album America's Sweetheart is definitely NOT a disappointment. The whole album is worth its money, from the catchy fast tracks like the first single, ""Mono"" and ""But Julian, I'm a Little Bit Older Than You,"" to slower tracks like, ""Hold On To Me,"" and ""Never Gonna Be the Same."" This album shows Courtney's growth as a songwriter and this will definitely go down as one of the best albums of 2004."
5,Hell Yeah!,Finally the CD was released and I was NOT disappointed. Great CD. Also quite different. Not music I would usually be into but Courtney does it great. I have not been disappointed yet by one of Holes/her CD's.
1,Solo album that fails on about every single level,"Courtney Love is many things but IMO talentless is not one of them, and being a fan of Hole's ""Live Through This"" and ""Celebrity Skin"" I was really anticipating this album. Unfortunately, it's just another case of a brilliant frontperson going solo and sounding really bad without a band that could give her music some identity. Lyrically, Courtney has lost none of her bite, but it's just a shame that the lyrics are accompanied by the music which is generic, lame and boring, with no interesting hooks and melodies to write home about. While I never thought Courtney a great singer, her howling vocals can sound right when married to the right music. But here she just sounds awful, especially when she tries to sing a ballad that she simply can't pull off. I'm still interested to see what she does musically in the future, but this album is a definite pass."
5,MAKES ME FEEL TINGLY IN MY BIKINI AREA,"Thank god or whatever is holy that someone has the guts to be a rock star. Ms. Love has died for your rock'n'roll sins, people. Do not crucify her for it. Love her back and pray that this album brings a second coming of rock. God forbid we put up with another 10 years of rap-rock and musical diarrhea."
4,"Give me Love, Love, Love...","Courtney has returned to her grunge roots and with heart warming results. Her genius has always been in her ability to elicit mixed responses and this album certainly does that, allowing the listener to empathise, sympathise and headbang to sensuous lyrical imagery and rockin' guitar riffs, while Courtney's voice speaks from the soul, from the fire burning in her belly. Rough around the edges, this may be deemed a work in progress, but certainly whets the appetite for more to come..."
5,A must read book for ALE-EDI consultants,"This is an excellent book, even for beginners in this technology. It tries to cover the topics as if it is a real life example and explains the concepts right from scratch A book that an ALE-EDI consultant must read"
5,"Well structured, easy-to-learn and reference",The material presented in the book and CD-ROM has been well thought out and very well structured with the reader in mind. Good source for learning and reference two super technologies of SAP. I especially liked the section on creating ALE interface from scratch. Presentation is excellent. I recommend it to all SAP professionals.
5,A must to own book by SAP R/3 ABAP Programmers.,ABAP programmers can use this book to implement ALE and EDI technologies without the pain of jumping around the SAP's Help manuals. Also a good reference book for SAP project managers and Functional consultants to understand the technology better.
1,Great summarization of SAP's online Help,"The Subject says it all. If you take out the pages of screen dumps, summarization of the Online help... One is not left with much worth purchasing"
1,A waste of money,I have been working in the field of EDI for 11 years and in SAP for almost 5 years and the I/T field for 15 years. This book is a total waste of money. It primarily contains info that can be readily obtained from the SAP online documentation. I recommend purchasing the Arvind Nagpal SAP/EDI book since it does contain some useful information. LET US STOP SPENDING MONEY ON THESE WORTHLESS SAP BOOKS TO SHOW THE PUBLISHING INDUSTRY THAT WE WILL ONLY TOLERATE THE BEST SAP RELATED BOOKS.
2,A quick read. Missing all of the goodies from 4.X,"It was a quick read. It is much better than trying to learn ALE from the online help, but it really doesn't contain any additional information. The nice features from version 4.0 and 4.5 are missing. The book is dated from the day you buy it."
2,On-line SAP help,"Have you access to the on-line SAP help? If yes, then do not waste your money! If this is your first approach to ALE and EDI, it worths the bucks you'll spend on it. No original ideas, no tricks in this book."
4,Recently Married,This pup dress is so cute but I would advise is definitely smaller than what is published. Order it a size big! Shipping was prompt and the material good quality. I recommend purchasing for the price but definitely advise ordering ONE size UP!
4,cute dress,this was ordered and came in time for the event... it could have had little more material for the dress to cover dog body but the veil was very cute
5,ADORABLE!,"Here in Tampa we have ""Dogtoberfest"" so I got this adorable outfit for my little girl and a tuxedo for my boy. They were quite the HIT at the festival looking all dapper in their silk outfits. My little girl pranced around like she knew she was in a dress it was so darn cute!! Great quality product and a great conversation piece."
4,"BEST "" UNKNOWN "" JAZZ TRIO !!!","I RAN ACROSS THIS JEWEL AT A USED CD STORE...( LOOKING FOR A BARGIN ). AND I GOT ONE. THESE GUYS PLAY TRIO AS GOOD AS ANY BIG NAMES I HAVE IN MY COLLECTION.( 2,000 JAZZ CD'S )AND AS A JAZZ MUSICIAN MYSELF I DO NOT ACCEPT JUST ANYTHING..AS GOOD...BUT THIS IS. IT IS A LIVE RECORDING BUT , A VERY GOOD ONE. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT 4 STARS NOT 5 , IS ...THIS IS THE ONLY CD YOU CAN FIND FROM THIS GROUP."
3,"moderate in control application, good for practical application","The book does cover some detail aspect of magnetic modeling, but some details are not covered such as the rotational transformation between stator to rotor coordination. The model built is suitable for low-order controller design and could be improved if higher order with state space representation is included for more design of non-linear controller algorithm.However, the practical aspect of the materials is good such as the electronics,controller and application examples."
3,Good documentary,A good documentary showing some historic aspects of the Bear movement and its role and the Bear 'culture'. A number of interesting interviews providing perspectives and life stories.
5,Awesome stuff!!,Sista Monica can do old time gospel like no one else. This is a fantastic cd and I highly reccomend it to everyone.
2,Oh My good lord! What happened?,"I see little that could improve upon this book. Its examples are awful and assume a knowledge of Perl not expected of similar entry-level texts.Avoid this book unless you have a great solid background in Perl. But then again, if that's the case you probably wouldn't need this book."
3,"Before, during, and after the Civil War","Living in the Shenandoah Valley, the book made a lot of sense to me and provided information as to J. Hotchkiss' early life and his life after the war. I grew up in Roanoke, Va. which was the headquarters for the Norfolk & Western RR, and reading about how Hotchkiss helped the RR to expand into SW Va. and into W. Va. was interesting. Also about his desire to get a physical map of Va. published and how he worked with William B. Rogers the State Geologists (namesake for the highest mountain in Va.). The bottom line is this book is a history book and it follows the title in its content."
4,Great book for building web 'bots with Perl,"I really enjoyed this book. It made using the LWP libraries much easier. It is well written, though repetative in some places (my only major complaint).I'd recommend this book to anyone who does Perl programming and wants to build quick, simple and easy web 'bots to scavange the net for information on your behalf."
2,Too loud and floated in tub rather than stuck to bottom,"I bought this product because I love spas and I figured it was an affordable alternative. It worked for the most part, but it shot cold bubbles and did not stick to the bottom of my tub. It will only stick if you have an old timey porcelan tub, if there are any grooves to prevent you from slipping, it will not stick and will float to the top. I was trying to enjoy my spa experience, but had limbs everywhere trying to hold it down and meanwhile my water was getting cold. I did not think it was worth the money. It was a good idea, I just wish they could make it work better."
3,It is okay!,"The bubble spa is very very loud, the air coming through the tiny little holes is very cold and the hose will not stay in the darn thing. About the suction cups, the big ones worked for me but the smaller ones WILL NOT WORK. IT does though feel good and gets hot, BUT it is really LOUD!"
1,Very disappointed,"I was so looking forward to my new Bubblespa....what a disappointment! I should have returned it but didn't. Just as everyone else, I can't get the suction cups to stick to the bottom of the tub...whoever said it was a floating air mattress was absolutely correct!"
1,Another HoMedics good idea but horrible implementation,"HoMedics have great ideas, but they rarely put it in their design. I live in a new house, and all of my tubs have a anti-slip finish (made not smooth on purpose). This tub design is fairly common. HoMedics should of taken into consideration when designing the suction cups. The cups would NOT stick to the tub. You eventually end up play with a mat that wants to float to the top of the water, but you wanted to lay on the it. Just like another user said, the floating part end up spraying water mist at ya. It will not relax you, but drive you crazy. SKIP THIS PRODUCT ALL TOGETHER!!!"
2,SPA,"I bought this item and was quite disappointed in it. It does not stick to the bottom of the tub. I could never figuire out how to work the remote. And it was entirely to loud to promote relaxation. It did however provide tons of bubbles and you really feel like your in a jacuzzi tub, but if I could return it I would."
3,Not Terrible but Dissapointed...,I recieved this item and was disappointed right out of the box being that there was NO REMOTE CONTROL like the TITLE SAYS. Its a challenge to get the suction cups to stay stuck to the bottom of the tub. Its kinda noisy even on the low setting. It's not terrible for the money.. It works- I'll give'em that but I wish I had recieved the one they displayed in the title.
1,Terrible Illustrations,"I wanted a large book of Mother Goose rhymes for my grandson for Christmas. Although it is rated ages 4-8, I thought my 3-year-old grandson would enjoy it, based on the cute color illustrations shown on the view of the cover. The only cute illustrations were the ones on the cover. The ones inside were small and all green line prints. In addition, it is soft cover. I compromised on the soft cover because hard cover was not available. I would not recommend the book for anyone under 6."
5,Jesus Loves Me tape from Baby Go to Sleep,"""I got our tapes and we loved them. Chelsey listened to both tapes and the Jesus Loves Me Edition is the one that she loved...She gave the other to her half sister to take home...she sang all the way home...she is two. And our Chelsey, the 7 yr old with the attitude of a 50 yr old - the worlds Greatest Non-Sleeper - slept until 7:30am this morning...a first in her life...even while on chemo for leukemia....just amazing...the first night! She's been through 130 weeks of chemo and treatment...been sexually abused, physically abused, neglected, has many tags...ADHD, Relative Attachment Disorder, LD (visual perception IQ is 51---overall is 66) from brain damage caused by severe blow. If this tape can help our little girl and us, (her grandparents who are raising her), it has to be a miracle. I will soon be ordering some to take up to the hospital where Chelsey was in-patient for 8 months. What a wonderful gift."" (Stephanie Pierce, web page author of ""GrandsRuS"")"
5,Thinking about Psychology,The item I received was perfect. It was the shipping that took too long. I though I would have it by a certain date and it didn't come until at least 5 days after the date I was told.
3,Worthwhile Kaempfert,"There is nothing overly sensational about this Kaempfert outing, nor is there anything substandard. Kaempfert's sound is workman like and solid on many of these recordings, such as Raindrops, Jean, Traces and Games People Play. Less than good is a reworking of the Supreme's Someday We'll Be Together. As with most of Kaempfert's arrangements trumpets are front and center. Kaempfert's music, more so than Percy Faith's, who usually stamps his easy listening reworkings of 60s materials with lush strings, sounds like what elevators used to feature years ago."
3,cute shoe,"The shoe is attractive and stylish. However, it fits a little big. I should have ordered a half-size down."
4,Challenges to Wild Salmon,"This film does a good job detailing some of the challenges facing maintaining salmon stocks that are challenged by giant hydroelectric dams, but it is sort of depressing to watch.I bought the video to help my young sons develop an appreciation for the fascinating life cycle of salmon and their important role in many ecosystems. It does this in sort of a backhanded and depressing way.My sons definitely learned a lot about salmon, but they did not really like the video much because of its downbeat tone."
2,echo valley illuminarie moon stake,"Thought the moon would be a little larger especially for almost $30 bucks. Not really a good deal. The product is pretty, but doesn't stand out in my yard."
3,Not what it looks like in picture.,I did get a moon stake but not like this. I think I was sent the wrong product or never got this at all.
2,Disappointing,"As a garden ornament is is adequate.Unfortunately, as far as it 'illuminating' it does not.It is in full sun all day long and at night there is nothingaround it but a small landscape light and still it does notglow. I called company and they said to move it to where itwould be in total darkness at night. Done. Still doesn't work,The 'companion' piece that we ordered was the Saturn Stake.They tried to mail it to me two times but both times it brokein transit and carrier just sent it back to Amazon. I decidedI'd had enough and choose not to try to reorder this one andget my $ back as the first wasn't glowing."
2,size of item Do not know if it illimuates yet,"I cannot believe how small this top of the item is for price that I paid. I do not know if it evens illuminates yet for I just received it today and put in the fgarden Rediculous for the price.Also, the company has not gotten back to me about my comment and I sure they do not answer other peoples comments. What a shame. The packaging was not good because the box that it cam in was fully open. How can Amazon sell such a item."
2,echo valley moon stake,"i am not happy with this purchase, the stake was much smaller than expected, and it does not glow in the dark as was stated, i would give this product a 2 star rating"
2,Disappointment,"Does NOT glow. Looks ok just sitting in the pot, but I wanted something to glow at night..............would not recommend"
3,small,"This item is very small. It came double boxed and I was decieved by this into thinking it was a decent size. I have tried it out in the garden yet to see if it glows, but I think that the price was definetly too high for the size."
2,"Beautiful, but VERY misleading!","Granted I should have read the description before I ordered it, but the moon/globe are much tinier than I had imagined! Just like others have said, it is in direct sunlight ALL day long and at night time in complete darkness, there isn't even the tiniest hint of a glow. This item is very beautiful, despite it's very small size, but the pictures and description are VERY misleading! I would love to send it back for a refund, but I'm honestly not in the mood for the hassle."
3,Got item on time,"Got item on time, its as lovely as in the pictures, however it has never glowed in the dark so you cant see it in the garden at night, and thast dissapointing, however it looks ok in the daytime."
3,disappointed,Love the design of the moon and earth but it did not glow in the dark. I was very disappointed.
3,"Beautiful, but..........","Beautiful & looks pretty in garden. This is the 2nd one I've gotten - first one was a gift - the only disappointment is that they don't light up, even after being in the sun most of the day."
1,Disappointed,It was much smaller than I thought. No glow at all. The company has a great idea they just need to make it larger and provide the glow it promissed.
2,Echo Valley Illuminarie Moon Stake,"The advertisement is misleading. It states that it will glow at night. Mine never did, despite being in the sun all day. It is now being used as a planter ornament."
2,Grossly overpriced,Fun to watch but not illuminating at all. BUT....I bought a set of 4 from Costco for $25. I wanted to replace two defective ones but this price is beyond ridiculous.
2,Extremely Disappointed,"As with most of the reviews posted, I too am disappointed that it does not glow in the dark after four days of full sunlight and that was my reason for the purchase. It looks beautiful, a bit small though, but I was excited about seeing it lit up at night. There wasn't any instruction included in the package so it must mean that the only thing to do is plant it in the earth. I read a review in which someone mentioned a switch but where is it? When I examined the product closely there was no battery, no bulb and no switch so how can it collect and store the solar energy? I do not intend to go through the hassel of returning it but I would like an explanation from the company since there are so many complaints. Additionally, I do believe that I and other customers who experienced the same problem should be given a partial refund because the item is pricey."
2,Does not glow,I was so disappointed with this purchase I left in the sun for 3 days and it still doesn't glow I feel like I was ripped off.
1,not good for the price,this says it will glow but it does NOT GLOW. so for the price it is not worth it.Would not recomend
2,"Dissapointing, but still cute","This product is cute, and it is currently in my garden, but it does not illuminate as advertised. It seems to have glow in the dark paint in the glass orb, so maybe if you shine a flash light on it for a while it will light up. It is also smaller than I expected."
4,Perfect for the Nightstand,"I purchased this set as refills for my Homedics AromaSpa Aromatherapy Diffuser. The scents are very soft and pleasant, not overbearing at all. Love the set -- it's extremely easy to remove/replace in the diffuser with no mess involved. Packed in small plastic jars, they keep very well over a long period of time.The perfect spot I've found to use my diffuser is on my nightstand where you can fully appreciate the fragrance it emits. If you're looking to provide aromatherapy for a larger room or area, you may consider another type of product as this one works well for smaller areas and the fragrance does not travel very far."
3,BEST FOR small ROOMS,"You take it out of the box, open the beads and WOW! They smell pretty good! But the distance between your hand and your nose is relatively small... Plug the device in and you still can't smell it across the room. Not recommended for use in any room that isn't small. If you use it in a small room, I think you will like it."
3,Great concept,The Homedics AromaSpa Aromatherapy Diffuser worked beautifully BUT these weren't particularly my kind of scents.
1,This Is A Travesty,"The last thing Wicca needs associated with it are the words fun and trivia. This book makes Wicca look less like a serious spiritual path and more like D & D without a dungeonmaster. I'm really appalled at the number of people who do not see where a book like this is detrimental to Wicca, and I'm even more afraid that these people don't even care. Technically, this book tests objective information on a very subjective matter. I don't think the author took her responsibility to the Wiccan community as seriously as she should have--authors should realize that by writing a book they are representing the path and are also teaching their audience."
1,Minichyna,"These are junk! Poor design, fall out of my ears, ill-fitting, distant sound with no base, distorted and mine also got tangled on the retractable spool. I can't even say i'd use them for a cheap back-up."
2,Don't waste your time or your money,"I am not a novice when it comes to the outdoors. I've been camping and hiking, etc., since I was a wee one. So usually when things come without instructions, I can figure them out fairly easily - not this harness. Firstly, it's made of some of the cheapest webbing I've encountered lately, and secondly, it is not user friendly. The buckles are cheap, so they're not in any hurry to go on or off, and the thing is completely shapeless. There was some kind of paper included that may have been instructions but if so I couldn't decipher them. In my opinion you'd be better off getting a holster for your spray can and then making a harness or just clipping the holster to a d-ring by your shoulder."
2,Bear Defense Spray on two occasions,"I had the chance to use this Bear Defense Spray on two occasions, one was during a promotional radio comedy show. The Bear was tame and I got $50 for Spraying it on a Bear. Didn't seem to work at all, it sneezed a few times but it didn't do a thing. If it hadn't been tame (w/ a trainer), I would have been torn to pieces.Occasion two was when I went hiking in the mountains. I came across a brown bear near a small creek and he came at me. I froze, reacted calmly, took the Bear Defense Spray and used it. The only thing it did was startle the Bear, it retreated but eventually came at me again, but I had time enough to run back to my truck where I hid for safety.Bear adrenaline, either from male 'heat' or anger, is enough to override the effects of a little pepper spray burst, just like a man on drugs or alcohol can still attack if hit with pepper spray.In all, I wouldn't recommend these Bear Defense Sprays at all unless you are dealing with a Bear cub."
2,"Great show, great episodes, skimpy DVD set","This show is top notch. The best Food Network has to offer! However, the DVD set only has 9 episodes over all three discs. It should have at least eight episodes per disc! Shame on the Food Network for treating their best show with one of the shabbiest treatments on DVD."
3,Not enough per disk.,There could be a lot more segments per disk. There are 3 disks that could easily be condensed into 1. The segments cover multiple years and could easily be expanded.
5,GREAT DVD!!,"I actually ordered this DVD for my 12-year-old daughter - we watch Food Network together, and Unwrapped is her favorite show! It is really interesting and enjoyable to watch for any age. It shares how common things we see/eat every day are made from beginning to end. We've watched it over & over together."
4,Interesting read,I ordered this after reading an article on transcendentalists which mentioned a couple of his books. They were written toward the end of his life. He has different perspective. Food for thought. You may not agree with him but sometimes its good to get different perspectives to help confirm you are on the right path.
4,"Unusual ideas, for artists","This book has some very interesting ideas. Its more for the real artist who is making altered books, not the more crafty person. It sparked several ideas of my own. Not a first book to buy, though, if you're just getting into the subject."
2,Ok but sort of hobbyist- oriented,"I guess altered books are a hobbyists' realm. I did get one great construction tip from this book, though so it was worth it. It's just that a lot of the pieces in here are kind of hokey."
3,New Directions in Altered Books,"This was a well made book with good photos etc. It was not entirely visually appealing to me however and I felt a little let down. If I had seen it in the flesh prior to purchasing I would have left it. (One of the pitfalls with internet buying I suppose).However, maybe I am not into the whole 'altered book' process and as such my comments may not be a good overall yardstick."
3,Not what I was looking for,"This book will fullfill the needs for those who wish to see what some crafters are doing with altered books. Unfortunately, this didnot perk enough interest for me to explore this media. I found the featured projects to be repetitive and not very exciting."
3,OK but not great,"It's OK if you like a toothbrush that will do some of the broushing work for you, but it seems that the sonicare is still a lot better. But if you want a electronic toothbrush just because it's neat, then this is a good cheap alternative to sonicare."
1,HOMEDICS TOOTHBRUSH,"ALTHOUGH THE PRICE OF THE ITEM IS ATTRACTIVE. WHILE BRUSHING YOUR TEETH, THE WATER/TOOTHPASTE SOMEHOW SEEPS INTO THE BASE OR HANDLE OF THE TOOTHBRUSH, WHICH MILDEWS AND LOOKS UNATTRACTIVE BEING THAT THE ITEM IS TRANSLUCENT. THE BRUSH HEADS OFTEN FALL OFF ALSO"
2,Flimsy product,"The small heads make this useful for kids. However, we had this toothbrush only a few weeks before the heads needed to be replaced (fortunately, Amazon carries them). The construction is kind of flimsy."
4,More than two minutes,"For the price, I feel this is a good rotary brush. It usually takes longer than the recommended two minutes to completely brush teeth. My complaint, watch your tongue. I lost a few layers of skin on my tongue...caught between the rotary brush."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"After only about three months of use this has already broken down on me. It won't hold a charge anymore. I hope Homedics is aware of all these bad reviews of their product. This product is simply not made to withstand a typical bathroom environment. The housing is made such that water and toothpast will seep in no matter how you use it. The brushhead will stop working in about a months worth of use as the combined water and grime will stop it from working. Did they even test this thing themselves? What were they thinking......... A bathroom product that is not waterproof and is intended to be used near water is just mind boggling. Brushing with it was okay, but the quality and design of the product leave MUCH to be desired. STAY AWAY from this product."
1,Terrible Product!!!Buyer Beware!!!!,"Flimsy, cheap, and downright faulty. NI-Cd battery dies after only 1 month, and whole assembly inside is gooey with water/toothpaste mess. Poor product, stay away."
4,"Overall, an excellent source of information","All in all, this was a pretty good book. It included nutrition and general fitness as well as many, many exercises for each section of the abs. The section on the anatomy of the stomach was rather lacking, but that can easily be remidied with a quick look in an anatomy book. Also, there was not too much detail in the routines about such things as how long to hold the contraction, isometrics, pulses, etc. Such information was briefly mentioned, but I felt there should have been a whole section devoted to this in detail. Despite these two minor problems, I felt this was an excellent source to develop a top notch ab routine. I would definitely buy it again, and I will probably buy the other two books that Kurt has written on the lower and upper body."
4,Good book as selection of exercises,"I should recommend this book if you want to have a nice selection of abdominal exercises. Other information (like nutrition) is relatively of small significance in my opinion. This is only an auxiliary book. For real and thorough training I recommend ""Essentials of weightlifting & Strength Training"" by Mohamed El-Hewie."
4,the complete book of abs,this book has helped me strengthen my core. i have a bad back and this book was very helpful to not aggravate it while i worked out.
3,"Great for begginers, OK for intermediate, not great for Advanced","Great book for begginers...I have been working out and eating nutritious for 2 years now, so this book gave me no suprises. Great info on how calories are stored, a few good tips on nutrition here and there. Great ab exersizes, and the 6 month plan to ripped abs is good. Just starting my first day of ab program today. Wish me luck!"
5,Great Book. Excellent Results.,"I already had a decent ab workout routine, but the book gave me additional ideas to vary my workout. Following the suggested plan given in the book really added definition to my abs. My wife has also noticed her stomach flattening as she follows the routine. Highly recommended. I checked out several other ab books and this one was the best by far."
5,An Amazing resource on abdominal excercise.,The one and only book you'll ever need or want on working out your gut. The excercise tips are invaluable in getting the most out of a workout. A classic of an excercise book.
5,Julio,I love his music so I may not be the best critic. I just wish there were translations for all the songs.
3,"Good, but not for the faint-hearted","This book (which only covers Isaiah chapters 1-22) tells you everything you could want to know about the accuracy of the published Hebrew text. It prints the text from the 10th century Aleppo codex, plus variants from the Septuagint, Vulgate, Dead Sea Scrolls, Talmud, other Rabbinic sources and several mediaeval manuscripts. Invaluable, but almost impossible for the layman (or laywoman)to decipher."
3,Cynical marketing gimmick or innovative genius? You decide,"Glass evokes strong responses. I personally have enjoyed much of his music. It was a marketing muse, not an artistic one, that would pair Glass with a group of mostly talented and well-known pop songwriters.This odd combination creates an inoffensive and unique listening experience. I can't think of another cd even remotely like it, and for that reason I keep it in my collection, and throw it on the cd changer as background music.But the cd doesn't rise beyond the level of slightly quirky background music, and doesn't represent a high point in anyone's career. Paul Simon and David Byrne have written strong lyrics - they aren't on this cd. There isn't any passion on this cd; it seems routine for Glass, and a insignficant diversion for the songwriters. I wouldn't recommend AGAINST buying this cd - I only caution that it has the virtue of novelty (which is not insignificant), but few other virtues."
3,Stars,"Striking record of a time when, in the mid-80's, it looked as it intelligent art pop and modern classical music might cross over into each other, this mixes Philip Glass' mostly electronic music with lyrics written and sung by Laurie Anderson, Paul Simon, David Byrne and so forth (the credits above seem strangely incomplete).It's an interesting experiment, although it doesn't really work as music or art very well - and there's a horrible air of middle-class smugness over it, as all the people involved were, by this time in their careers, thoroughly institutionalised. Believe it or not, there are some people who find the abovementioned rather tiresome. Still, it's cheap."
4,"""Well, here we are""","When I received this CD, I was inclined to send it back because of the involvement of various pop stars in it. In fact, I'd just read an article in 'The New Republic' about Philip Glass that called the work 'popsy'. But I saved it for a drive from Florida to New York, and I'm sort of glad I did. 'Sort of' because although it was quite enjoyable, now I can't get the music out of my head after a week. Some of the music seems lifted straight from other Glass works, but Bach and others did the same thing, so Glass can't be faulted for that. I didn't care for the singer on 'Changing Opinion'; he or she had too much of the breathiness that passes for authenticity in pop music. But whoever sang 'Open the Kingdom' has a fine alto or high tenor. Fortunately, I couldn't follow the lyrics while driving, so they sounded more mysterious than they actually are especially the cute 'Liquid Days: Part I'. It's not Glass's most innovative work by any means but it's still an entertaining diversion."
2,Get back on the solids,"Even amongst much hit and miss recorded material, these choral keyboardings are just a constant bore, even a mild embarrassment, with a few pretentiously exotic bombardments substituting for the album's most emotionally satisfying moments."
5,Great lore,"The 1872 Modoc War makes a fascinating backdrop and I learnt a couple of interesting things about the sad fate of Modoc renegade Capt. Jack which I couldn't find in other books. This is a fictionalized account of the Modoc War, make no mistake, and the author's choice of introducing a fictitious character, Jim Wallace, amidst otherwise perfectly historical characters is a risky one. But the gamble pays off, and the book is replete with interesting details. The author's attention to such details, while never forgetting about the big picture (this conflict, the author says, heralded Wounded Knee and the other brutal massacres that ensue) make this book a truly fascinating read. I found this book to be extremely well-researched yet very entertaining. One nitpick, though: Queen Moon's character was underdeveloped."
5,My grandmother's story,"This novel is based on my grandmother's family history. Anatoly Rybakov was my second cousin. He interviewed my grandmotehr several times, taperecorded her stories, baed the novel on our family's history.This book was published in Russia in 1979 (the year I emigrated from the Soviet Union), and it was the first legally available publication to mention the figure 6 million (estimated number of Jews perished in the Holocaust).The story is not necessarily girm or frightening, there is quite a bit of humor, a very romantic love story and a pretty uplifitng ending despite all tagedies."
5,It was haunting and I will never forget this book.,"I read this book over ten years ago. I lost it during a move. I actually read parts of it to my children and then they went on and read the book in it's entirety when they grew up. We still all talk about it and it's beautiful images amid the saddness. I hope that anyone who has an interest in mankind, the human spirit, and the kindness and cruelty of mankind will read this book and embrace it's message."
5,Wonderful Chroncile of Life,"A wonderful chronicle of a Jewish family in Belarus beginning in the early 20 th century and culminating in its destruction in Hitlers holocaust A cast of remarkable characters illuminates this novel : The fiery Rachel and her soft spoken husband Yacov Ivanovsky,Rachels father the respected and tough Abraham Rakhlenko,the colourful Khaim Yagudin and The Ivanovsky children includin the narrator,Boris and the beautiful Dina. We grow to know and love the characters And it with a profound sense of horror and tragedy that we see their cruel destruction at the hands of the NazisIt is however through the few survivors such as Boris Ivanovsky and his sister Lyuda and the young Olya that we find hope . I cannot help however being frustrated by the ommission of the horrors of the Bolshevik Revolution and the Stalin years even though it is clear that due to censorship in the Soviet Union when the book was written in the 1970's, the writer could only hint at these things"
5,The very best A Capella music has to offer...,"For those of you who don't know, Harmony Sweepstakes is a national level competition between A Capella groups of all genres. This CD is a live recording of some of the songs from each of the groups that competed at the 1998 Harmony Sweepstakes. Each group has a different flavor and style, and each song on the CD is an enjoyable gem. If you like A Capella music, this is a must-have CD. Even if A Capella is not your thing, you should check this CD out... it might turn you into a believer. Personally, the groups ""Blind Man's Bluff"", ""Metropolis"", and ""+4dB"" caught my attention, but all of the songs were music to my ears."
3,Sturdy but can't find refill for pen,"The clip board is sturdy, holds the paper securely and looks very nice. The pen writes well. The only problem I have is that I can't find a replacement refill for the pen."
2,"Broke after 4 months, just a vibrator","I guess I expected kneading action or something, but it's really just 10 small vibrators that offer a tingling vibration, so it's relaxing but not necessarily what a sore back needs. I've sat in massagers that have rolling bars or elements that actually knead, or push at, your muscles and this does not come close.Still, it did feel nice to have it in the car seat and on the way home it did help after a hard day of sitting at a computer.My favorite setting was Mix All, which did all the patterns, zig zag, up and down, pulsating, etc.Then of course it broke after four months - first the LCD control became only partly readable and then it just stopped responding -no vibration at all..."
3,What Happened?!!!!!!,"Sorry triple 6, but Choices 1 was a whole lot better than this.First thing, what happened with the beats?, choices 1 had thatdark, murder, heavy bass hits like y'all usually do which made itunstoppable to listen to. But Choices 2: The Set Up soundtrackwas WAY different but I still listen to it though. But Not as muchI listen to choices 1. What's going on?, I hope that this wasnot Sony Music's decision."
4,Pretty Good Movie,"Three 6 Once again drops a crunk album. Though not they're best, it's pretty good. The best tracks are It's Whateva Wit Us, Gettin' Real Buck, and Who Da F*** U Playin' Wit. The soundtrack is by far not Triple Six's best album. If you want the good stuff check out Mystic Stylez, The End, Chapter 2: World Domination, and Prophet Posse: Body Parts. You should pick this album up for the DVD movie. The movie is pretty good, better than I thought it would be. It is funny at times, too. So go ahead & pick this up."
3,"Direct, driven, reminds of common success ideas in business.","From the beginning you can see that Ms. Bick learned a lot at Microsoft. Half way through I began to see many common business practices that are usually more talked about than used in real practice. Then at the end the real value of the book came together. Since Microsoft is clearly a leader in business and these techniques are used there, you can't lose by incorporating them into your work world no matter where that is."
3,Very easy to read book,"A very easy to read book, if what she said was true, Microsoft will be a great place to work!"
3,Frighting book,"The thought of people emulatingMicrosoft's business practisesis scary at best. Here we havesomeone suggesting that we use abusiness model based on acompany that does everthing init's power to destroy thecompetition. It has practisedcopyright infringement, and setup licensing requirements thatwere illegal, requiring the USDoJ to step in.I can only hope people who readthis, and consider basing theirbusiness on the Microsoft model,will look a little deeper andturn over a few rocks, beforethey jump on the bandwagon ofwhat I consider to be one of theworst large companies in the US."
3,Good ideas but nothing revolutionary,"This book has many good ideas, but most people have probably thought, heard, or read them elsewhere. It is an enjoyable, humorous read, however. For those with limited business backgrounds it would make a great starting point."
2,Pleasant insight-free bathroom reading,"""All I Really Need to Know..."" is a quick read full of cute anecdotes about life at Microsoft (but no insight into the company's success). It's chock full of obvious tips for business managers. This wouldn't be so bad if it were well organized and comprehensive - a primer on how to be a good manager. Instead, it flits from topic to topic and never covers any subject in depth. I don't doubt that many fresh-out-of-college Microsofties could use a management primer, but this is more like shmoozing at the water cooler with your mother. ""Be nice to others."" ""Manage your manager."" ""Don't run with scissors."" Or email, in this case."
2,Kinda Dorky and Incomplete,"I found some of the anecdotes insightful, but with those few that were, they were not detailed enough for me to trust the resulting outcomes of following Bick's advice as legitimate. For the balance of the anecdotes, I found them either dorky or plain common sense. Why did I but this book?!"
5,I really liked this but...WORKING AGAIN YEAH!,Well we have had this for about 2 months now and at first I loved it. Then it seems the pump has quit on us and no more bubbling. Maybe we just got a lemon.......but...all i know is I wish it still worked for the money spent on it.UPDATE: My hubby looked at this and he said there was some kind of setting thing in it and it works great again..he even was able to increase the bubbles....helps to check out why not work !ALso..when our bulb burned out it was very easy to replace and they sent 2 extra free bulbs with our light!LOVE THIS as a nitelite in my kids room at nite.........Now i want one for every room..lol.....GREAT SIZE ALSO!!!
1,It will break!,"My sister and I each got one of these a few years back. After minimal use, a motor in my sister's died and it stopped changing colors. Shortly after that, the water pump in mine died and it stopped making bubbles. I'd say they both died at around 15 hours of usage. And I see that there are a lot of other reviews claiming similar problems. I wrote the company, Homedics, asking if they could fix it, they said no, and then I asked if they could at least tell me the type of pump it is so I could look for one to replace it myself, and they said they couldn't tell me. Don't waste your money on their products."
1,Pump Fizzled Out!,"Bubbles were cool, lights were cool, however, the pump fizzled out after a few months of operation. Am currently seeking a new pump......."
1,"Great Idea, Cheap and Boring Design","While the idea behind this product is ingenious, its implementation was very disappointing. After owning several aquatic sculptures hand crafted in the USA by MIDWEST TROPICAL, I decided to buy the Homedics bubble tube. It really did not live up to any of our expectations. The tube's use of cheap, flimsy, tennis-ball-tube-like material reflects its quality as a hastily made piece of (...) junk. Once this unit starts giving you problems, and it will, you may as well throw it in the garbage. The pump goes dead in a matter of no time, and the light is impossible to find once it burns out. Customer support on this product was non-existent. While the idea of aquatic sculptures is a truly great one, I find Homedics' interpretation of MIDWEST TROPICAL's products crude and cheap. (...)"
1,About as poor and cheap quality as you can get,"Don't waste your money on this version. The slim case is very flimsy and breaks easily which also allows the disc to become easily scratched. The audio quality is laughable. It's far worse than the faded version I watched on cable television. Every single pop and crackle comes through making it hard to hear some of the dialogue. The picture quality is faded and shows every single scratch and streak. The dvd plays like it was recorded directly from the poorest quality version aired on television. I couldn't even finish watching ""the shooting"" to see if the movie was badly edited or if it was the complete version. This version doesn't have a menu to select which feature you want to watch, it just starts playing with ""the shooting"" first. Extremely disappointed."
1,Face Reading,How disappointing. I'm glad that I ordered another face reading book--it was comprehensive and based on some solid evidence (which this book was not).
4,works for us!,"we have had this item for a year now and it's still kicking! it works very well. we leave the sound on all night, and never use the timer. we do not use the aromatherapy feature, as i found i was sensitive to the scents and they would bring on my allergies.the only bad thing is, when we go away we have to bring it with us because we can't sleep without it anymore. our bodies have gotten so used to a constant sound, we rely on the machine to fall asleep.overall though, it's a great sound machine for the price and makes both my husband and i sleep fairly consistently and soundly."
4,Nice for the price,"I like the timer settings, and some of the sounds (particularly the Ocean setting). However, I find the lid tothe aromatherapy compartment difficult to open. I often have to get a pen or paper clip to pop the top off."
3,Homedics ES-1 Envira-Spa Aroma & Sound,"I've lived in Chicago and Atlanta and find the machine a good addition to block urban noise. My dog even seems to sleep sound under the ""white noise"" option. I primarily use the sound options but have a couple of complaints, although none would stop me from buying another machine. The first is the lack of more sound options. The other is the short cycle on some modes. For instance, on the ""Summer Night"" mode you can easily hear the program recycle, which quickly becomes annoying. The Aroma Spa is pleasant and adequate for small areas, such as bathrooms. Don't expect much in larger bedrooms. The aroma fan seems to drone and vibrate, overpowering the sound program at lower volume levels. Even with the complaints, I still believe that the Envira-Spa is the best on the market for the price."
2,Worked for two weeks.,This unit has a loud fan motor. It just stopped working one day after only two weeks of minimal use. Don't waste your money.
2,Okay!,I bought this product a few months ago hoping to help relax myself in my late pregnancy. Not at all pleased with the noises and now the sound part of my machine no longer works. I do like the aroma part of it but feel that it was a waste of money!
2,breaks easily,"This machine worked great for about 3 months, then the aroma therapy part quit working, then the on/off switch quit. So now we use it by plugging it in everytime. We only use the white noise to keep our baby asleep, and that part works fine. But I was disappointed that the machine broke in two different ways within 3 months. It is an expensive ""fan noise"" now!"
2,Kind of annoying,"I was very excited to get this for a gift, and it can be fun to use, but the aromatherapy function is not that great. The noises are very mechanical sounding and repetative. I prefer a nice candle and a CD player."
1,Stopped working in 18 months,"Even with light, intermittant use, this did not last for me. Shop around."
2,Unimpressive,The noise this machine makes sounds noticeably electronic and the scent is nonexistent unless you are right on top of the machine.
1,Keep shopping - lots of problems with this one,"I give this machine one star because some of the sounds are relaxing and realistic, but... there is so much vibration that the sounds are drowned out by the rattling noise. Also, the scent diffuser doesn't put out any smell beyond a few inches from the machine. The instructions say not to put it on anything but a solid surface (not on the bed, towels, etc.), so there isn't a way to get it close enough to the bed to benefit from the aromatherapy. If it is on the nightstand next to the bed the rattling is obnxiously loud. I am very disappointed that HoMedics put out such a poor quality machine since I have some of their other products and associate the name with quality."
2,Just too noisy,The idea of this product is great but there is just too much background noise. The noise of the machine practically drowns out the nature sounds. I'm returning mine due to poor quality!
3,Very relaxing.....but sometimes annoying.,"I love all the sounds except the woodlands. Like so many of the other reviews say, you really can hear the footsteps, I guess whoever was recording it was walking??? It sounds like someone was wearing high heels and walking on a wood platform. Anyway, it repeats every 5 seconds or so, so it gets kind of annoying. But the other sounds are pretty good. The aroma thing doesn't put out much scent...you almost have to have your nose on top of it to smell it. But I still gave it 3 stars because it covered up the city noise outside and helped me fall asleep."
1,"THE NOISY FAN DIED, NO SMELL","When I first got it, I was anticipating a great little device, i.e. the pleasant aroma along with sounds of nature. Initially, the little fan was loud and annoying but I could smell something albeit not very pleasing. The sound was okay but the fan would drown it unless the volume was way up. Then one day (a week after I purchased it), the fan died and no smell emanating and just sound. I feel like I have just half of what I paid for. Not very happy with it at all."
2,Not worth the money,"We have used the HoMedics sound machine several times now, not satisfied with the results at all. The sounds are ""tinny "" and the aroma beads have yet to produce aroma. At times some of the sounds are soothing, such as the Summer Nights, but when used in combination with the aroma beads, the sound of the machine drowns the sound of the ""Summer Night"". My advice is not to purchase it."
5,BETTER THAN EXPECTED,ALMOST DID NOT PURCHASE AS THE PRICE WAS SO LOW.WAS SURPRISED AS TO HOW EFFECTIVE THIS UNIT IS.DOES EVERYTHING IT IS ADVERTISED TO DO. GREAT ITEM. REALLY HAPPY WITH THE PURCHASE! EVERY FEATURE WORKS JUST GREAT=IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES THE SCENTED BEADS HAD OUR SMALL BEDROM SMELLING LIKE A SPRING GARDEN=LOVE THE SOUNDS IT EMITS=VERY SOOTHING=LOVE THE FACT IT HAS A VOLUME CONTROL AND TIMER= AN A+ ITEM
4,Relaxing,"I bought this for myself and as soon as it arrived, my daughter (18) fell in love with it. She says its great for relaxing when studying or falling asleep. The timer controls allows her to fall asleep with it playing. It can be used with just sound or sound and aroma. The sounds are very realistic, I would recommend this to anyone...:)"
3,"Sound Mode - Soothing, Aroma mode - Noisy","The sound mode works quite well with decent volume control and soothing sounds. Aroma mode works poorly. Scents are extremely weak and fan is entirely too noisy. Fan speed cannot be adjusted. Thus, aroma mode and combination mode are useless to us."
3,for the money works well,I have a child that is not a sleeper he did go as well as stay asleep with this machine it takes his abuse as well. The scent part is a bit lame it is not what I'd ever use again.
3,"Just ok, not great, not terrible,","I got one of these for my girlfriend for XMAS and it is ok.the great thing about it is that it has aroma and a noise maker, which are pretty difficult to find together.the bad, the beads are not much aroma, maybe for a 10x10 room, but for anything bigger I'd suggest a nice candle. another bad things is that the noise make can only be turned on for an hour max. this happends to be great for my girlfriend since she normally leaves the tv on at a low volume for about an hour, but for someone like me, i need the sound all night.the good, again it has noise maker + aroma. And you can use the scented oils in it, which i would highly suggest. forget the beads"
1,Too noisy!,"Not only is this product too noisy to enjoy the sleep sounds, you have to press your nose against the machine to enjoy the scent. I don't recommend it."
4,Not a waste of money,"(...) This machine can run all night. it can shut it off after 15, 30, or 60 minutes if you choose but you can push the timer one more time so neither of these options are lit. Then it'll run all night. I use it for my 3 yr old so the baby won't wake her up too in the middle of the night.I've used it every day and night for two years. It's (or any sound machine) is a must-have for overnight trips!!I'm thinking about getting a second one for the baby's room. However, I never use the Aroma part and would like something smaller for overnight trips."
3,Better models are out there.,I think the sounds were too fake. I have a different unit that actually cost less by the same company & I like it better! I was not thrilled with the aroma choices either.
1,Not What I expected,"When I preordered this book, I thought I was going to get a deep, insightful study guide for one of my my favorite Bible books. I'd heard people speak so highly of Piper and was anticipating being uplifted and edified. It is a poem. I was very disappointed. I'm sure it others will find it it to be a wonderful book, but it wasn't what I was exptecting."
5,Arrestingly Good Tale!,THE LAW AND MISS HARDISSON is delightful and an easy read. This one will capture your heart!
2,Very unhappy,"When I bought this, I was fascinated by the idea of the lighted fountain. That does work. What doesn't work is the water fountain; if you set it too low then you get very little movement and when it is set up higher water splashes everywhere until it settles down. I made the mistake of setting it too close to the lamp shade and somehow it drizzled all over it. Now I have a ruined ... lamp shade and the waterfall fountain is awaiting the next garage sale. There are much better fountains out there. This is not one of them"
4,Awesome and relaxing,"I bought this for my mother, she loved it. It was just the cure to help her relax. The sound of water is amazing and there has not been one problem with it. Go get one!"
5,More than I Bargained For!,"I needed a source of humidity in my office (Salt Lake City is in a desert). I was not prepared for the attractiveness of this fountain! The design is simple and very pleasant. The light moves, diffracted by the falling water. The sound of the falling water is not as noisy as some fountains, and is very soothing. It is not difficult for me to maintain; I shut off the fountain when I leave each day, and I use only distilled water, to avoid mineral buildup. I've had many compliments, unusual in an office where so many have desk fountains!"
2,Tabletop fountain,"Alas, we had lots of problems with ours. It's attractive, but the water has to be refilled every day or two, particularly if you use the light. Unless you have very soft water, you'll find yourself cleaning out calcium deposits (just a fact of life). The light went out after about 3 months. After 6 months, when we went away for a weekend, the basin went dry, the pump went out, and we never bothered to replace it. Sure, we should have remembered to turn it off but I think the same thing will happen to lots of people.Pluses - attractive and soothingMinuses - high maintenance and questionable reliability"
1,"Great Idea, Bad Product","While the idea behind this product is ingenious, its implementation was very disappointing. After owning several aquatic sculptures hand crafted in the USA by MIDWEST TROPICAL, I decided to buy the Homedics desk top waterfall as a gift. It really did not live up to any of our expectations. Not only was it smaller than I had expected, its quality reflected it as a hastily made piece of (...) junk. After poor customer service, numerous problems, and no assistance after the ninety-day warranty we had to trash the unit after four months. While the idea of aquatic sculptures is a truly great one, I find Homedics' interpretation of MIDWEST TROPICAL's products crude and cheap. If you're looking for a piece of aquatic artwork, go to the people who invented the idea of indoor water products, Midwest Tropical. MIDWEST TROPICAL's designs are exceptional, staff gracious, and most importantly their quality is second to none. (...)"
3,THE PICTURE IS NOT CORRECT,"This is the correct picture according to manufactures:http://www.aiphone.com/products/alpha-list/detail/ccs-1aIf an error please immediately change the picture, I've tried before this product is excellent, but the photo did not know."
2,Batman and Robin Swing,"This is a cash-in album originally released in 1966 to exploit the Batman fad. It has gained some noteriety over the years, because Sun Ra and members of The Blues Project played on it. Musically, however, it is nothing special. Most of the tracks don't have much of a melody, and just feature the musicians jamming. This is okay to listen to, but it doesn't really represent the best of either Sun Ra or The Blues Project. However, I do have to say that the nearly 7 minute ""Batman and Robin Over the Roofs"" is pretty wild, cool and swinging. One unfortunate thing about this CD is that it is in mono. I think that a good stereo mix would really enhance this recording. This CD is really for hardcore Batman, Sun Ra or Blues Project fans only."
3,Could have been anybody,"Sun Ra, John Gilmore, Marshall Allen, and Pat Patrick apparently sat in with Al Kooper and some others to make this straight-ahead R&B record. Not a bit like post-1950s Sun Ra, this is recommended for collectors and for dance parties. Not bad for what it is, but don't start here if you want Sun Ra."
1,Not what anyone would hope it is.,"This one is so bizarre it really needs to be heard to be understood. Evidentally, somehow producer Tom Wilson managed to convince Sun Ra to bring several members of his band (including John Gilmore, Marshall Allen and Pat Patrick) into the studio with parts of the Blues Project (who I confess I'm not overly familiar with) to record the Adam West Batman TV show theme and a bunch of loose jams for a record for a toy company.Yeah, it sounds about like that too.It's a terribly unexciting album-- straightahead blues jams on a bunch of classical pieces retitled. And the playing isn't particularly exciting. And while ""Batman and Robin Over the Roofs"" manages to cut loose and really features some fine playing, for the most part, all the pieces are edited before any of the playing gets particularly interesting.A curiosity likely only of interest to Sun Ra or Blues Project completionists, everyone else should probably skip this one."
3,A Blast From The Past,"I still have the LP of this album and was very glad to get the CD. Although this is not the original TV theme music, it is very close and certainly has all the 60's feel of the original...The Batman Theme is the main reason for most folks buying this album but my favorite piece is The Joker is Wild...and I didn't see this cut on any other Batman album.If you're looking for great 60s, discoteque style music, this is a great album!"
4,BIFF ZOK ZWAAPPP!,"What a hoot!! I got this on vynil at the age of 6 right at the height of the Batman craze and even though it wasn't music from the TV show as such, it STILL was a lot of fun. Gotta love those twangy guitars and groovy brass with good 'ol Sun Ra adding his wonderful spook organ to the proceedings. Who'd have thunk it, Sun Ra playing for a far different and younger audience and us for many years being none the wiser."
4,Best Review Yet!,Was very pleased with the information that was covered in this book. Was an excellent study tool.
1,Lacking In Every Possible Area,"Good God, this is the worst book ever written. The prose is terrible, there is no intelligent plot here and, for that matter, there is nothing intelligent in this book at all. The author must either be in elementary school or be mentally ill to produce something this thoroughly awful. Reading through this book I got the impression that the author composed this work while he was bored at his job sometime and couldnt think of anything better to do. Indeed, it shows remarkably little inspiration and sounds like the ramblings of a disturbed individual. I would highly recommend that all stay away from this book as it is a large waste of money."
5,Lake Geneva revisited,"This novel breaks new ground. A wonderful send up of a secret agent in Europe you wont want to put it down. It doesn't hang about, for the action moves along at tremendous speed. All the while you're trying to figure out what will happen next The Stork himself is a wonderful character. I loved him! I haven't read too many books which actually made me laugh out loud but this one did. And, although it is a spoof, the details of the locations and the weapons used are accurate to the smallest detail. So if you fancy a read which is different - order it now!"
4,Vintage Aaron Marc Stein,"The hep cat, Matt Erridge is at it again, helping out dames that get him into trouble-- this time in France and Spain. The flavor of the month is identity theft (though they take Baby, the Porche, too) and sneaking political figures over the border. As always, Stein's books are a blast. They are dated, but that is part of the charm. It is also great to read a thriller from this era where the hero is a capable engineer and not a super spy. The only down side is that you can't get this is e and the paper books, being half a century old, can be a little fragile."
1,Waist of money,"I bought this item thinking it was going to protect my Garmin screen. This product almost destroyed my Garmin, The stickers that come on the cover did not come off and the GPS did not work with the cover on. I would never buy this product again nor would I recommend this product."
5,Unbelieveable,"This, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, is called ""Music."" I haven't put this album down since I purchased it. These guys still know how to bring it to those of us who still enjoy this thing called ""Music."""
3,Where is Keri Lewis?,"When I first fouind out, Mint Condition dropped a new album, I was completely excited, as I love Stokley's smooth and relaxed vocals and their great musicianship. So you can believe I was excited to put this on, as I have been a fan of their music since the early 90's. However the one thing that really bothered me was there was ...NO KERI LEWIS(principle songwriter for ALL of their major hits). This really takes away as Keri was(next to Stokley) the most important memeber of this band. The band is still tight, but Stokley in the past would co-write or maybe pen a tune or two. On this album he has tackled over 90%....and the results are not to my liking. There is no ""Breakin' My Heart"" song, in the sense that it just stays with you after one listen. Yes the groves are good, and yes Stokley is still in fine form, HOWEVER be warned(as I wish someone had told me before I bought this). You will notice considerably that Keri's songwriting is greatly missed. GET HIM BACK NOW!!!!!"
1,This is my least favorite Mint CD,"I'm a BIG Mint Condition fan However, I was very dissappointed after listening to the CD. Stokely's voice is amazing....but on this CD, you don't hear his range...you know that Mint Condition we all know and love. His range on these songs are what anyone who can carry a tune can sing. The first single, ""I'm Ready,"" gives you a taste...a ""very small,"" taste of that range, which dies out during that very first song and it's not picked back up at all. This CD didn't click with me. The music or the lyrics...It was just too all over the place. Overall, this CD is like Gumbo, missing some of it's MAIN ingredients."
3,"Solid, but still mostly for fans","Mint Condition returns (albeit in smalelr label form) and they sound very much like they always have: solid, but uneven.Part of the Mint Condition ""condition"" is that in a world where being able to play an instrument is a gimmick, these guys still bounce around the musical landscape as if they have to prove something. So songs with elements from almost every other form of music pop up in the strangest places and the albums end up sounding more like amalgamations of other bands instead of one with a vision.Par for the course, this record is. Some good songs, but a lot of filler as well...but if you're a Mint Condition fan, you're used to it. To their credit, they don't sound stuck in the past - they sound as fresh as ever. They just can't get out of the cycle of the past."
5,MINT'S BEST CD OVERALL!!,"I addictively listened to LtLB for 6 months with no changes!! With a more rock-edged vibe, I felt I was introduced to Mint Condition for the first time!! They've seasoned their flavorful blend of original music and cooked up some tasty tracks, such as Whoaa, The Tempest, Runaway, Fallen Apart, My Sistah, etc. Despite the departure of one of the members, you will find no indication of a loss!! Tackling an array obstacles as a band over the years, Mint Condition has truly risen to the top of their game!!"
1,Stankin' Like Doo-Doo Brown....,"New Edition tried it, Portrait, Boyz II Men, BlackStreet, H-Town, IMX, En Vouge (from time to time) tried it, now Mint Condition is the latest successful 90's group to make a comeback in 2005. The comebacks mentioned previously were disappointing and I don't know what these reviewers are listening to, but if you are going to buy this cd, just send me your credit card number and give me your money instead. The Mint goes for quantity (18 tracks) not quality on this session and include a dvd too so you can SEE how bad the cd is. This is one time I'm glad I got a promotional copy so I can sell it on (...)"
5,Mint Condition.. REAL MUSIC,"I absolutely love the CD, Living the Luxury Brown. It showcases the vocal talent and unity of a group I have grown with. I have been a loyal fan and time does not diminish their talent. This CD is outstanding."
4,Should be livin' the luxury platinum,"I absolutely love this cd. I've been a mc fan since the pretty brown eyes era. I must say, although I love this one, it is a little less than what I expected from such an awesome group. I appears that they branched out, musically, more on this one. It may work for some people and to each his own, but I was expecting an all out mc smash album. Some songs were probably better left to perform live. All in all this album is a good one to have in your collection. I'm expecting it to go all the way (platinum!!)"
5,Outstanding work by a group of talented brothas,"Growing up, my father was a drummer, so I have come to appreciate bands and real music. Mint Condition has been one of those bands that makes quality REAL MUSIC! And they have done it again with this album. Since the day I got it, I have not put it down. Bands like this are very rare in this day and age and all I can say is that I hope that they continue on with their originality, and mix of rock, R & B and Latin flavor. Even without Keri Lewis on this CD, to me they dont really miss a beat! In the DC metrop area we really love live percussion and music since Go-Go is our home music. Thank you for keeping this type of music alive yall, and I cant wait to see them live tearin it up. I missed them being here and making the DVD that comes along with the album, but I wont miss them comming back around in August. You have a true fan here who really loves what they do as a band, and please dont stop until the wheels fall off."
5,These Four Estonian Girls Kick Ass!,"The voice of Lenna give me goose flesh and chills.If you like`Alone`with HEART you will love `Destroyed by you` and `Just another day to live` with V.N. I am now 40 years old and i have never heard so genius music before.The way the songs is build is like i can hear it again and again and still discover new things.The girls sing beutiful together and the sounds of the synth the guitars is delicious.The drummer is really good. I say without a doubt that this is a masterpiece production.This one and BLUE TATTOO.Its like they are in a different league,way above anything i`ve heard."
5,A Universe in a book,"This and a handful of other literary creations rank among the best of the 20th century. It is a dense, jungle of images, language, against an elegant background. I can not think of another work to compare Paradiso to, as it stands alone. Once upon a time, I attempted to read it in Spanish, but was overcome by a tidal wave of intricate vocabulary.It is unfortunate Lezama Lima has been largely forgotton in the US except for a few ardent readers. It is impossible to find any of his poems in translation. Maybe they are not so readily translatable. In any event, the translation of Paradiso is in itself an amazing achievement, as Paradiso explodes in volcanic beauty."
5,Great Mirror clips,"These mirror clips are well designed, heavy duty, easy to install, and come in several different finishes (which comes handy). This manufacturer also makes straight clips (for mirrors w/out a bevel)"
2,just a boring kind of house..................,I think this is just a boring kind of house. Maybe a bit better than the other album by Twerk Humantics.I am italian and the tracktitle Porca Miseria was a real surprise for me. It is a very common form of swearing - you might not know that in italy swearing is a very rich part of the language. Unfortunately if you listen to clip from each track like you can do here it sounds the same boom boom to the four. A new kind of house but the same old story.Please if you have any feedback to this write to - carlogiova@yahoo.it - i would be happy to share thoughts.
4,Twerk - Now I'm Rendered Useless,"Twerk's second album, NOW I'M RENDERED USELESS, continues the glitch-tech from HUMANTICS, but with slightly more warmth. ""Unit_Onjer,"" for instance, has a bubbling percussion that contrasts to the hard thumps of the earlier album, though the synths are still plenty chilly. ""Porca Miseria,"" on the other hand, has some subtly warm synths sliding around in the background, and even though ""Grunt Sculpin"" kicks off on an abstract note, the synths help smooth the ambience out (""Miol,"" on the other hand, stays abstract throughout). The 4/4 returns on ""Chilli Charm"" and ""Now I'm Rendered Useless,"" bringing the abstraction back to the dancefloor, and ""Quimjik_Sorvey"" rounds out the album. Though not as emphatic as his other work, this album still has plenty of strengths."
4,Good Stuff overall,Tom Clark once again gives us some good poems. He starts off the book with basic poetry and ends with a thirty page or so story consisiting of one characters life. Overall this book is good but not recommended for a beginner of Tom Clark's work
2,not very happy,"I bought one of these cameras and so did my mom and friend, Im suprised there were not more reviews about the blurry pictures, you can take 50 pictures but atleast half of them will be blurry and no good, and its not just me my mother and friend have the same problem, and also you cannot use night time mode its almost impossible to get a picture that is not blurry in that mode, we all got these cameras last christmas because they sounded so great and were supposed to take great pictures, we were all dissapointed, it does take nice pics when you acutally get one thats not blurry, but to me its really annoying when ever I take a picture of the kids or something I have to take 4 of them atleast to get 1 or 2 to not be blurry!"
2,Don't Be Fooled,"I use to have the Fuji Finepix 700 till it broke down. I loved that camera, so I decided to upgrade in the Fuji line. I bought the F40FD. The picture quality was terrible, even though it had the face detection. I tried every setting all the pictures were coming out grainy. If your buying a camera do not buy this one."
4,Very happy with my purchase,"I would not consider myself a digital camera expert by any means, but I'm very happy with the Finepix F40fd. The numerous modes make it such that you can get a good shot in almost any environment. The simultaneous natural/flash mode is especially useful. As far as video is concerned, the sound quality in much better than I expected; it's not nearly as garbled as video I've seen taken from other digital cameras. The only sticking point is that the photo quality is merely sufficient. This camera won't get any shots that take your breath away, but for the price, the quality is about what I expected. Overall, I'm definitely satisfied with this purchase."
4,Good Camera - but Fuji Service Bad,"I got this camera from Amazon back in Sept - Great camera, but disappointed in Fuji service. For the first time since buying, in November I plugged the camera in via USB to a Mac and it wouldn't recognize. Tried it on an XP system and same thing. Sent it in for Warranty repair, and Fuji came back saying ""USB port broken - impact damage"", and would not repair under warranty. The camera has less than 40 pics on it total. Told me I would have to pay $85 and they would send me a refurb. No thanks - they are sending my old camera back broken. I can still remove the SD card and download pictures. Fuji isn't what it used to be that's all I can say(i've owned 3 Fujis, but this is my last)"
4,digital camera,love it; if it only could zoom more in; it definately would be 5 stars for the price.
3,Brilliant At Times,"This is one of the most fustrating cameras I've ever owned. Having owned quite a few other P&S; digital cameras before, I looked fwd to seeing what the F40fd could do.At times the pictures produced are absolutly brillant. Colors are alive and the picture is as sharp as a tack. These photos typically happen outdoor. The flash pictures are also great. . .if the subject is close enough for the flash to be effective.However, at other times, in low to medium lighting, the pictures are a touch grainy. Probably better than most cameras this size, but still not as good as I hoped or expected (probably the Fuji F31fd would be a better choice). Since many of my pictures are taken indoor, a lot of photos came out must less crisp than I would have liked.Overall, I wouldn't recommend it unless you plan to use it mostly outdoors.Terry"
1,Fuji F40fd disappoints,"Having read great reviews on some of last year's Fuji F-series models (F30, F31fd and F20), I was optimistic that this Fuji would have the same great low light performance and image quality as its predecessors. Not so. I am extremely disappointed with this camera. The pictures come out grainy at ALL ISO levels, and get worse as you increase the ISO level. The pictures also lack sharpness. I have tried all settings, and have yet to get a decent photo from this camera. It is much worse than the 3 year old Canon S400 Powershot that I have. By increasing megapixels, Fuji has drastically decreased the image quality of its camera. Not recommended."
1,camera only lasted one year,"Camera last one year. That was it. Dead as a doornail. Battery has charge, memory cards are fine, camera just stopped working. Never dropped it, treated it very well.Very sad, won't ever buy a Fuji camera again. What a waste of money. My Canon I've had for years, it's been dropped and everything and it works fine.I don't know why it stopped working, funny that it's one year from when I bought it."
2,I don't think so.,"Some of this book is ok. If they would just stick to nutrition it might be ok. They wrote that exercise triggers migraines. Exercise opens the blood vessels and helps aid blood flow. My wife started getting on the treadmill in the mornings, and it's greatly reduced her migraines and improved our love life. Many parts of this book are crap. Oh, and it says sex triggers migraines. It actually relieves it. (again, that exercise factor)We read half of it and pitched it in the trash."
1,Don't waste your Money,"I guess I should have paid more attention to the other reviewers. These canisters are great for about 3 weeks till they start cracking on the bottom and they won't hold a seal anymore. Oh well, live and learn."
5,GOOD TO GO,ITEM WAS JUST AS LISTED AND SHIPMENT RECEIVED ON SCHEDULE. I WOULD ORDER AGAIN. . EXCELLENT PRODUCT5+View tips and guidelines | 6 more words required
4,Vac it !,"I love these but they are so over priced for plastic !! I have never had issues with the containers like some people, but I wash and dry them by hand as to avoid the plastic getting cracked or warpped in the dishwasher."
5,FoodSaver Works For Me,"My FoodSaver machine has an accessory port and these canisters store my fruits and vegetables, dry goods and baking supplies. I do not use it for coffee, but I do use it for lettuce. I have tried other storage options for lettuce but the vacuum pack in a cannister is great. It works. I follow all the directions and I have not had any cannister failures - everything keeps fresh. Taking the air out seems to make things last forever. My lettuce never kept better or longer!I do not know why anyone has had a cannister problem and I will not conjecture to know why they experienced problems. I do know that I followed the directions, and for the last several months have been more than happy with the results. I go a step further in that I hand-wash everything - but I rarely like to use the dishwasher anyway. Don't let anyone scare you out of trying these products - see for yourself how well they actually work."
1,they all cracked at the bottom,"FoodSaver 3-Piece Canister SetExcept for the smallest one, these developed cracks within the first two weeks of using them. Do not waste your money. They will not hold a vacuum once cracked.On a positive note, I love the wide mouth lid vacuum accessory. The regular mouth lid is much more difficult to make a seal."
1,Canister cracked on first usage,"I just recently purchased a food saver vacuum sealer, and I love it. I decided to purchase these containers (and some others) to cut down on bag usage). I read some of the reviews but figured that they had worked out the kinks in these containers. No luck (at least for me), the largest round container cracked on first usage. They were hand washed once, after we removed them from the package, but have not been near our automatic dishwasher.Unfortunately, I would recommend to stay away from these containers, unfortunately. I will try to find some others."
1,Will not stand up to regular use,"I have owned my canister set less than six months. During that time it has never been in the dishwasher, and only washed in mild soap and rinsed. The canisters have cracked on the bottom, and will not hold a vacuum. The canisters only held crackers and were great while they lasted. The plastic needs to be thicker, or of a slightly different make to ensure that they will not crack. This is a ""Don't Buy"" from me. Other containers not made of this type of plastic from Foodsaver work well and I have not had this issue."
1,"Older canisters good, new ones bad","I have used the Foodsaver line of products for years. I have many round and square canisters. The only ones that last more than a couple of months are the older ones. I have had new ones crack immediately. You can send them back over and over again, but eventually you give up. Unfortunately you can't buy the old canisters...funny thing. Other than the canisters, the rest of the products work well. I agree with others in this forum: I would give zero stars for this product if I could."
2,Canisters crack,"Somewhere along the line, Tilla/Food Saver decided to cut costs. Screw Grandma, she'll never comp it.I bought this system to use, not put on a shelf. So far the marinator hasn't cracked. Most all of the canisters have. Tilla/Foodsaver says that they are sorry to hear that, & do nothing more. I glued the cracks on the bottom, only to make more cracks.More often than not, the seal doesn't hold on the canisters. Tilla says there is goop. I say I wipe the canister & the seal.When it does work, this is great. But if you have to check things on a vacuum seal, that's stupid. I'm waitng for Ronco, ""Seal it, & forget it"".Also note, like condoms the bags have holes."
1,DO NOT BUY THESE,I purchased this set and all three failed within a week. I contacted foodsaver and they sent replacements and they all failed too. Again I called and they sent more canisters of larger sizes and they failed....i think there should be a class action suit against the company for selling faulty products. The vac system works fine but these canisters are JUNK !!!
1,Deserves 0 stars,"These are completely worthless containers, as they do not hold vacuum for more than a day or so. I have purchased other Tilia containers without problems. I was looking for a smaller set and thought these looked like a good option. I have given up using them for food storage;instead, the bottoms now hold plants, and the tops have been thrown away."
1,WORTHLESS,"This product does not work. Keeping the seal area clean doesn't allow vacuum to hold for more than 1 hour. Discussions w/ Tilia reveal heating (w/ warm water) is a possible solution. Of course, with the small mass, the seal doesn't stay ""warm"" long enough to work... so their suggestion isn't workable. It's a real PIA when picking up a canister (w/ a bad seal) and drop it, spilling 2 qts. of bread crumbs everywhere. Oddly enough, the large (2.5 qt. and up) sizes work fine."
2,useful as vacuum chambers,"I got this 3-pack with my FoodSaver kit and while I haven't used them for storage, they're handy for sealing mason jars without the adapter cap thing, up to wide mouth quarts in the big one. Just put the jar with disk on top and seal away-- the pressure should make the mason jar lid flutter a little as air escapes. Release the pressure in the canister and see if you can lift the jar out by the lid. It might take two tries, but it's very handy; for the price of this 3-pack, you could get two dozen mason jars."
1,Very nice until they crack. Not recommmended.,The canisters work very well at keeping food fresh. EXCEPT they crack after using a few times with just hand washing. Small cracks develop at the bottom center radiating out. They will continue to hold a seal for a short while until the cracks become larger then no more seal. The attachment to vacuum seal canning jars works very well but is not practical for storing items that are used frequently.
1,"Yep, they crack!","Like many others have stated, these canisters seem like a good idea but they crack at the bottom and then lose the vacuum. Save your money; use the bags or get the square vacuum boxes (they work)."
1,"Much wasted money on these, they invariably crack for no reason","As many other users here, I've purchased a number of these canisters and they all seem to eventually get cracks. I've tried to treat them with kid gloves, not putting them in the dishwasher, being careful not to overseal them, etc. Doesn't matter, some crack even after just a few uses. I have one tall one that still seems to be okay, and the square marinator, but these round canisters are just very unreliable. With all the complaints, I'm surprised there hasn't been a class action suit against the company for knowingly continuing to sell such defective products! I now generally use medium and large mason jars and seal them with the handheld unit and jar sealers. This works so much better, but has limited space of course, even with larger jars. It's a shame Tilia can't get their act together and make canisters that will last."
2,No warranty on cracked jars,"Be aware that the manufacturer does not warranty the cannisters! As a ""one-time courtesy"" they agreed to replace my small cannister when it developed hairline cracks after a couple of months of use. Love the concept, but the product really needs a re-design. When they work, they are great. Just be warned that the money you spend may be for throw away products."
1,These are CRAP!!!,They DO NOT hold a seal and grandully leak in air over a fairly short period of time. I would not recommend these canisters to anyone.
1,Very fragile.,I bought 6 canisters in 2007 - I've shattered 2 and the remaining 4 have cracks. They still seem to work but I imagine it'll only be a little while before they all stop working. I would not buy these again in the future.
1,Bad container design.. Crack and leak!,"The vacuum seal concept is great. It allow me to save left over much longer. But all the hard plastic containers are badly design. All of my containers (various shape and size) failed within four months of usage. All of them develop cracks. The bad thing about it, Food Saver does not sell the container by itself. You have to buy both the lid and container together. The only container that can withstand the usage are those soft plastic lunch containers. I guess softer plastic allow it to flex and withstand the force of vacuum better... Food Saver should design better containers.."
1,1 star is 2 too many stars,These are crap. It's not even worth the time to look at them. The crack and break after one week. The seals don't hold the vacuum pressure. They are bulky. They EASILY get greasy and never seem to get clean. Do yourself a favor and only buy these to throw at people you hate. God I despise these things.
1,Mine cracked,"Yup, it didn't take long but mine cracked too. I was just looking online to see if perhaps someone made replacement cannisters of sturdier. Seems like there's a real market out there to snatch away foodsaver customers if someone else could come up with something better."
2,Six Years Later Only One in Three Still Works,"Everything you've read in these reviews about these canisters cracking within a few uses is true. They also lose their seal without visible cracks. As the owner of about 10 of these containers, I'd say two of them still work reliably for me after six years of use. Another two are a crapshoot. The rest don't work at all and I just store things in them with no vacuum. I'd recommend against buying these but if you do, be sure to buy extra because it's likely most of the ones you get will not work for very long."
4,No Problems Here..,"I own a set of these for about 4 - 5 years now. I did not get them from Amazon but it is the same set. I only store dry food like coffee, pasta. I never had any problems. No cracks and Holds pressure for as long as I need. I just got another set and was surprised by bad reviews."
1,Disappointment! Don't Buy - CRACKS,"Don't buy these. I've gone through 3 large canisters - all have cracked at the bottom. Foodsaver DOES NOT warranty this product so you're wasting your money. I loved the idea of this product. Needed a canister to keep my fury friend's dry food fresh and thought this would be awesome. I am so disappointed :-( Oh well maybe there is something else on the market, vacu vin?"
1,Doesn't hold a seal!,"After reading some of the other reviews, I can see that these canisters are of poor quality, and it's not just me. I love my Foodsaver vacuum sealer and use it often. It does a wonderful job of vacuum sealing wet or dry foods, and even vacuum sealing non-food items for storage. I bought the jar vacuuming attachments (wide and regular mouth) and use them with great success when I vacuum seal dry goods in canning jars.But the canisters and marinating container were a waste of money. None of them would hold a seal, and the clips on the marinating dish broke after the second use, making it useless. I had a huge mess all over the kitchen floor when I picked up a canister of dried lentils and the loose, non-vacuum-sealed lid flew off. I bought my canisters directly from Foodsaver, but wanted to give a warning here on Amazon. Luckily lots and lots of other unhappy customers were here before me. Don't buy these!"
3,It's a FoodSaver Product...,"FoodSaver has a lot of work to do on the quality of its systems, bags and canisters. It's practically the only game in town, so it is what it is. The canisters work great, until they develop cracks on the bottom. It inevitably happen with all of them, and not after a very long time. The tops work perfectly. We have an abundance of extra tops due to the canisters cracking. We use the broken ones to hold stuff that doesn't need an airtight seal. (Furthermore regarding all their products:) Their bags often do not seal, creating a lot of waste (and need to pay more money to get more bags). We've had to return and exchange a few machines from them due to malfunction over the years. We've come to accept that they seem not to care about improving their products. If there were alternatives we would certainly check into them."
3,My disapointment with the cannisters,"I already have a set of these cannisters and I love them. Yours arrived with the little button on top missing on the middle jar, making it impossible to remove the air therefore rendering the cannister useless. I'm not sure what I can do about this. Would you tell me. They are rather costly when you include the shipping charges, and when one third of the order is not usable they become very expensive."
1,Waste of money on food saver containers,"Don't buy the containers. I own round, oval and square and in more cases than not, when I go to open them there is not vacuum sound - it had not sealed. Since there is no way to indicate a good seal, you are just taking a chance. A complete waste of money."
1,not what i expected...,i thought they were bigger... they are small.. and soon as i opened the package i sent them right back... to small for what i needed for
2,Food Saver Cannisters,"These cannisters develop cracks very easily and they don't hold a seal for long. However, I do like the SIZE and the fact that they nest within each other for storage. I no longer depend on them for vacuum storage, but do use them for pasta salads and similar foods to store in the refrigerator."
2,Will not seal,I ordered these containers in December. My parents gave me a foodsaver for Christmas and I wanted a container to store coffee. So I purchased a set of these containers. The large container is very nice the only problem is IT WILL NOT SEAL. I've tryed every way to get this thing to seal and it want.
2,"Sadly, they all cracked...","We followed directions, handwashed, but in a short time (couple months) all developed cracks in the bottom and no longer sealed. When they worked, they were great. We have had 6 of these crack, so there is clearly a major design flaw."
1,Lids are not secure.,"I hates these canisters, I can seal the lids and put them in the cabinet. When I go to use them the next day the seal has failed. The lids fall off very easily. Very disapointed in this product."
4,foodsaver oh yeah,we've had several foodsaver products over the years...they all do pretty much what they are supposed to do..which is to seal stuff in a vacuum...
2,Reliability is the issue,"I bought 3 sets and two lids wouldn't keep sealed until I realized that after pumping you should release the pump""s handle before detaching the tube don't relase the tube from the top of the canister first. Now I have one lid that doesn't work.I thought these were Microwave safe and believe me they are NOT! So I've not lost a small canister. Now I have an extra lid and canister (MED). Anyone have the oposite?"
2,Works good when the canisters don't crack,"I've had 2 FoodSavers over the years and for the most part I like them and the canisters, when the canisters work. I don't have any problem getting the canisters to seal, except when they develop cracks as several of mine have, and these canisters are NOT cheap.I had the square one for marinading and it developed cracks within a year. I also have several of the tall round ones, and they too have developed cracks radiating from the bottom. Some of these are less than a year old.I'm planning on contacting the company about this, given the cost of these canisters, they should last much longer than this.P. Gray"
1,FoodSaver canisters,I have had my unit for quite a few years now. The only thing they work well with are the bags. The canisters stop holding the vacumn after about a years usage and the FoodSaver people will do nothing about it. For the price of this unit and the canisters they should last a very long time. I would not recommend this product. It is a waste of money.
3,works but poor design,"The canisters seal fine as designed. The only problem is the design of the lid. The lid overhangs the edge of the canister so when you pick up the jar you may grab the lid only. That is fine if the canister is sealed however if it is not sealed, the lid will pull off the canister may fall and spill contents. Maybe I'm a slow learner but I've spilled a few cans already. It would be better if the lid was flush to the side of the canister or if the canister had a lip to hold onto. Kinda of pricey"
1,"Yes it cracks!! No warranty for it, tell you to buy a new one.","Yes, it cracks!! Call customer service, I was told I should use it more carefully. No warranty for canister, tell me to buy a new one, by look at the review on this site here, it will likely to crack again.My husband who is a plastic expert (worked for GE plastic) told me it is not cause by usage, it a defect during molding process, if you happen to get a lemon you are on your own."
4,Fascinating,"I heard this on a college radio station the other day and had no idea what it was, just that it was a very interesting weaving of instruments, tempi, rhythms and moods. The radio station's playlist furnished the name, and Amazon will furnish the CD. (Don't pay attention to the rating; I haven't heard the CD yet.)"
4,Good Album but not a rocker like earlier efforts,"I Bought this album after seeing the hilarious video for ""I don't wanna Know."" That is still my favorite song on the album and while it isn't a seminal work from REO, it is full of radio friendly rock and ballads. I still listen to it on occasion."
3,Solid Album,"I have to hand it to REO Speedwagon. They stuck it out after many obscure years and kept coming up with good-to-great pop/rock material long after their long-awaited breakthrough with ""Hi Infidelity."" This disc was a rebound after 1982's disappointing ""Good Trouble"". I finally picked it up because ""I Do' Wanna Know"" was left off ""The Essential REO""; that, as well as most of this CD, has real punch to it. If you don't like the huge #1 power ballad ""Can't Fight This Feeling"", most of the record is uptempo rock 'n' roll with ""Gotta Feel More"" and ""Rock 'n' Roll Star"" worth the listen."
1,Do NOT Buy this from Amazon if there is a chance of return,"I bought this card not realizing I don't have an expresscard slot. Although you have 30 days to return the item before the activation fee/early termination fee kick in, good luck getting it back. Verizon wants verification of the return. Amazon customer service has no clue what you are talking about when you inform them of this fun fact. After many days and hours on the phone with Verizon I was able to talk them into refunding the early termination fee but not the activation fee, taxes or pro-rated monthly service fee. So this transaction cost me $60 for nothing but aggravation."
1,"Slows down, but resetting it speeds it up again","I originally gave this product one star because I was getting 90kbps downloads and 7 kbps uploads. After a call to tech support, they walked me through the process of reinitializing the modem and reactivating/reinstalling it. This sped things up again, but, over time or when I travel, I seem to have to repeat this process a lot to keep a decent speed."
1,Bad in NY-NJ area,"Verizon has extremely bad coverage between Newark train station,NJ and New York pen station -NY. I got this service to use it in train but it's so bad between this two station that you might as well not try.Also it does not switch from national access to Rev-A (3G) automatically even when I have 3G coverage. I have to redial. My conclusion: This service is not mature enough. Don't frustrate yourself over this. I am cancelling my service since I am stil under trial period."
5,"Great DVD, Great Seller!","This DVD is outSTANDING! The energy, the sound, the band...fantastic. Much more than I expected, and everyone I showed it to feels the same. The first one I got skipped in three places, so I returned it and was promptly sent a new one. So, everything was great from every angle!"
5,Another Electlic Performance,"This Is Incrideble on Blu Ray. The concert Itself Is so good and the run down of songs much different than his uaual. Yet everyone plays In such harmony, this Is one more fine recorded performance of the Boss doing his thing, and has become a perfectionist In his music. These are all great songs given they not his usual hits live. But that's the reason It such a good performance. This one If you like Bruce at all and have a Blu Ray get In Blu Ray It's an unbelievable sharp picture with no guards In the way.I think your going to love this If your looking at It.Honestly"
5,Absolute Must,"Purchased this DVD along with the pre-release of ""Magic"" and Patti's ""play it as it lays"". What a package!! Any Springsteen fan, those of celtic heritage or who enjoy that kind of music will be thoroughly entertained for hours. Took it along to a friend's on vacation and we found ourselves doing a bit of a jig to the rousing ""American Land"" at 7:30am. He, Patty and the band gave their all. Amazing horns and strings, and the penny whistle! What a show!!! Wish I could have been there. Bruce's arrangements of the traditional tunes did them proud."
3,"Great concert, bad Blu-Ray","Hi,well, I allready had the DVD of this fantastic concert. It's brilliant: Bruce Springsteen and the Seeger Sessions Band; completely new interpretations of old songs. Great! This is a really must-have-disc.. BUT!!This blu-ray is not worth. The video is unsharp, it seems that they just took the dvd and scaled it from 720 pixel to 1920 pixel. The sound is also ok, but it could be better for a blu-ray, sometimes you don't here some instruments you can cleary see.That's sad, because I have some other concert blu-rays which are clearly sharp, with fantastic colours.So, just take the DVD, that should work also and is much cheaper."
2,"Rating the Product, Not the Artist or the Genre...","I am a big fan of Bruce and have seen him in concert multiple times. Additionally, I really enjoy this genre of music (check out ""Vision Shared"" the story of Woody Guthrie and Leadbelly for a truly great DVD and value). That being said, the editing on this DVD is terrible. There isn't any natural flow and you don't get the feel of actually being at a concert.Within a 10 second span you get 5 or 6 different shots in basically this sequence - Medium close up of Bruce Singing, followed by an extreme close up of the drummers hands...back to Bruce and then quickly to the back up singers and then to an extreme close up of hands playing a guitar. The promo for this product talks about how many cameras they used - in this case more is less because all the switching detracts from the DVD.Bottom line: This isn't a slam against one of the greatest artists of all time or this type of music but...beware that this DVD is borderline unwatchable."
2,Yawn,I'm a fan of folk music and classic Springsteen but it was a chore to sit through this DVD. No one can question the musical skill or energy of this performance. The engineering production was also very good.But the performance was conceptually flawed in my opinion. Most of the folk tunes would have sounded better solo or with a minimal accompaniment. Instead we get a huge band with a huge sound that seemed out of place to me. Simple tunes can easily lose their simple charm under such conditions.There are some Springsteen classics in the mix. I usually enjoy the retreatment he gives to his classics in a live concert but this time he missed with every single one. Given the other (high) ratings for this DVD I must put all this down to a matter of taste.
3,Kid loves it parents despise it...,The songs and the kids in this video are very annoying. I don't want to watch it or hear it. The kids over act like they are trying out for a broadway show. Not of fan of child stars and the entertainment biz. Our 2 1/2 year old really loves most of the dvd but agrees with us that dressing up monkeys is creepy and just not right. Oh... please lose those little furry biggles (?) as they add to the annoying factor by 10x.
3,No feminist flick but really fun to watch,"I've always enjoyed this movie. It's quite funny at times, and the chemistry between Perkins and Fonda is surprisingly intense. At the same time, I wouldn't recommend this movie for pre-teen, female viewers because of its dated message about women, relationships, and college life."
2,beat chuggers,I thought this had the original Eric Clapton version of Forever Man and was disappointed to find out it wasn't on it. If you're in the mood for disco and like the song then you'll like it...
2,Not 150x,"I got the A-DATA 150x SD card and ran it against the SanDisk Ultra II. The class 2 Ultra blew away the supposedly class 6 A-DATA. ULtra was 196 pics in 60 seconds, the A-DATA was only 150. This was on a canon s3"
3,Domino games,Many games and their directions are easily found elsewhere - unless you really want to play a lot of dominoes - no need to purchase this book.
2,wow,"i was expecting a lot from this cd because i love shyheim's previous work, but when i got this cd in the mail and listened to it i was very disappointed. there are maybe three songs that i like out of twenty! the other thing is that four of the ""new"" shyheim songs on the cd can be found on the his other cd the greatest story never told and the two others can be found on the internet. i'm very disappointed in this cd."
4,Flirtatiously funny - Never trust a happy couple,"I tumbled on this movie by chance on TV, and was glued to the screen until the very end. At first, i thought it was a TV show, and thought the screen writing was excellent, and masterly done. The supporting actors ( the couple ) were hillariously funny, such chemistry with sex appeal and flirtatiousness that makes you laugh till the end. i was dissappointed when i can't find it on bluray. The story has great plot, moving in good pace stimulating viewer's emotion up and down just to keep it interesting. I have no choice but to get the Dvd, the only format ( beside Prime ) release. It's weird how some stupid movies got released on BR and some excellent ones like this ""Table for Three"" doesn't get released. Helllo!!!! I vote for the screen writing, the casting of excellent and fun actors/actresses who were perfect for the roles."
1,Annoying,I rented this movie because I like Sophia Bush in the One Tree Hill TV series. I could not even finish the movie because I became so annoyed with the characters. The movie seemed ridiculous!
3,Mix Feelings,"If you're bored, go ahead and get it. However, I think I should have just rented it - kind of impossible since I am deployed overseas. It was okay - but it was definitely a silver screen / b-rated / good cast, but lower quality kind of movie."
4,Hardshell mandolin case,"This is a good case for the money. The safety catches are secure and won't wear out before the case does. The fit is snug, but quite big enough. The pocket for holding picks, etc. is large, and the cover holds securely. The case is lined with ample plush to keep the instrument protected. There is room to tuck in a soft cloth for wiping the strings, and I have also fitted in a small chord book. Good protection, light to carry, fastens securely--I recommend it."
3,NOT A GUITAR CASE!,"I gave this 3 stars simply because the review has to conatin a star rating. I have nothing to say against the product or the company, only that this is NOT a GUITAR CASE! It is a MANDOLIN case! Amazon should correct this.Stagg STB-10W Acoustic Guitar BagEpiphone Case for Epiphone Dot, Sheraton, 335"
3,too small,"Although my mandolin is A-style, this case is too small and I could barely close it! I wish they would give some specifications in the description of this item, like the inside width, length, etc so the customer knows if the instrument can fit in or not..."
3,extremely uncomfortable handle,"The case is fine if you just need something for you to put your mandolin in, but the handle is so ridiculously uncomfortable when carrying the mandolin because the weight is so extremely unbalanced."
3,Too Small for Kentucky KM-160,"This is a very nice case for a great price, but unfortunately it doesn't fit my Kentucky KM-160 A-style. The top won't close when the mando is in the case, and by a significant amount (2-3 inches). It does seem like it would be a good case for other style mandos as other reviewers have stated. Amazon should provide the interior dimensions of the cases to make ordering easier."
3,We're in a tight spot!,"I am giving this item a 3 out of 5 because it is a very nice case for the money, but neither of my two A-style mando's fit inside without forcing them in. I have an Epiphone MM-20 BK and an Alvarez A style, so its not like I have some obscure maker that this case wasn't designed for. I am worried about leaving the mandolin in the case because I do not know if the pressure of squeezing it in there could cause the seems to crack. As a result...it looks like I am going to have to perform surgery on the case and remove some of the foam around the widest part of the case to fit my mando. Keep that in mind before buying this case. As is. Its a good case for a soprano uke and thats about it."
1,bad news,"Vintage Gibson A-models won't fit in it. Other brands won't either. Worse yet, the cushioning is scant. I wouldn't trust any instrument in this product."
5,Affordable and well built,"this case is nice and affordable, i have a epiphone mandolin that i got from guitar center, they wanted like 120 for a case, i bought the mando and then bought this case online..it fit perfect, so now i jam out david grisman style for longer periods with out my mando get destroyed"
5,A wonderful testament to the faith and perseverance of our American soldiers,"I couldn't put this book down and hated to see it come to an end. Captain Mulligan does a fantastic job telling his story with so much detail that you can see yourself there witnessing the sacrifices of these POWs. What impressed me the most was the deep faith that Captain Mulligan (and his comrades) clung to throughout this ordeal, and how he shares it so simply and honestly. A really great book that is inspiring and thought provoking!"
5,LUCHA LIBRE THREE STOOGES STYLE!!!!,"""GRIPS, GRUNTS, AND GROANS IS THE BEST ON THIS COLLECTION!!!! ITS CURLY AS A PROFESSIONAL WRESTLER!!!! YA CAN'T BEAT THAT!!!! WATCH IT AND SEE!!!!"
3,An Enjoyable DVD,"loved all the episodes. have bought about 8 dvds in the series. pity 'a play all episodes' option was not included in all the discs. frustrating to have to keep selecting 'play next episode'. other than that, enjoyed it very much."
3,Poor quality on one episode,"The quality on ""Three Little Pirates"" is poor ... I have to wonder if this DVD has been repressed, based on what the other reviewers said. There are very obvious vertical scratches (often more than one simultaneously) on the print for most of the second half of this short. Is this the best that Columbia can come up with?"
1,Bonk!,"The older I get, the more affection I have for Hollywood's ""golden age."" However, in this case, I'll make an exception. Over the years, I've come to find spinach and brussels sprouts not too bad. But folks, these guys just are not funny! Not only does every scrap of set dressing and costuming look bargain-basement, but the labored schtick the protagonists go through over and over lacks all wit or imagination. It must have been torture for all concerned to grind out these preposterous exercises day in and day out. And remember, during shooting and before the sound editor's ministrations, there were no juicy bonks, smacks, doinks, rips, and sproings to punctuate and enliven the goings on."
3,Nice At First,"I purchased this for myself with a gift card. It looked beautiful, but it was actually a bit of a pain to maintain. Firstly, the water splashes out a bit, so since I had it on wooden furniture, I had to put a towel under it. Secondly, my house water is hard, so there was a lot of mineral build up over time. It's plastic, and it's not easy to clean. The mineral deposits don't really scrub out completely. On the positive side, the sound was nice, it was pretty, and I could readjust the rocks anytime to alter the flow. I did throw it away after about 2.5 years."
3,Pleasant,"I am enjoying my new tabletop fountain. It has a definite zen feel and look to it. The base is black with a subtle ornate design to it. I have not noticed it making alot of noise, as some of the other reviewers have stated, but I try to make sure that the pump is totally submerged (this cuts down on the sound). It comes with the river rocks which are beautiful in themselves. I also put it together myself and the directions were easy to follow (and I'm not usually good with that stuff!. Some negatives: You need to place alot of the rocks in the fountain so that the light column doesn't show through so much. If you don't you just see this column of light and the zen feeling goes out the window."
3,YOU are you...,"IF you feel a strong need for such answers as this book offers, you may be disappointed. This isn't due to the book's contents, it's due to your question. I'll be fair and say the book is well done, nicely illustrated and quite entertaining. Yes, I purchased and read this book. I was asking the same question at the time; Who Am I? The answer is another question; How close do you want to look? How many ""selves"" and ""others"" do you want to create out of your complete, whole being? More bits and pieces -You're just making a bigger puzzle. Be careful what you search for... The included meditations are the best alternatives to these questions. This book is best left for entertainment purposes -leave it at that."
3,Not as good as the cover suggests,I was a bit disappointed with this book. So many different tests and ways of looking at yourself but nothing to sum it all up. This is a book that would be helped by having a score sheet included so that you don't have to write in the book.
1,Who Are You? : 101 Ways of Seeing Yourself,"I'd like to say ""0"" stars, but I did find this book interesting and provocative. However, the author does not understand the Enneagram and has written erroneous information about it. I enjoyed the book until I hit this section. I immediately slammed the book and took it back. My logic is that if the Enneagram information is incorrect, how can I depend on any of the material?"
5,It's Amazing!,"Yes, how did we fit such a lot of great stuff into 101 pages, well we didn't! The book has 224 pages, which makes it particularly good value at the price."
5,It never gets old,The enjoyment of historic Joliet architecture never gets old! Learn about the houses and people that made Joliet an architectual beauty. We must preserve these testaments to quality workmanship and serious craft long lost to the no style plastic houses of this modern time.
2,Tendency to leak?,"My experience has been that these batteries leak more than other brands like Duracell, Energizer, and Kirkland. And the battery was even dated DEC 2012 (it was Dec 2008 when this happened). I am not buying these anymore. See the photo I uploaded."
3,okay.. but no Duracell or Energizer,"I have a job that requires me to be on call constantly. My employer distributes Rayovac batteries for our pagers, but often I prefer to use my own Duracell or Energizer batteries. These will generally run out about 33% quicker. However, they are much more resonably priced. So if you don't mind changing batteries more often these are pretty decent."
1,Batteries leaked way before date,"We live in a vary rural area and in tornado alley, so power outages are frequent, and we require our batteries to be ready for the task when called upon, Today January 2013 while inspecting our batteries noticed we had two unopened packages of Ray-o-vac betteries that had leaked despite the date on the betteries which was Dec 2016. Can't count on them in pinch. Won't be buying this brand anymore."
3,To much covered not enough info!,This book is only 128pgs and covered to much with to little info. With everything covered this book needed to be at least 300pgs. Over all worth reading.
5,Near perfect condition,I was pleasantly surprised to receive this book that looks new and unread! It was for a friend who skates and she was delighted.
5,Awesome Thing,"this is one of my favorite things i own all kinds of little things and toys like lava lamps, rave wave, and other world of science things and the bubble lamp has to be one of the best things i have it's not just one color and it just relaxes you after a hard day just turn it on and let your mind loose while being relaxed by the bubble and colors"
3,much to fast for my 4 year old,"My son is just a little over 4 years old with a speech delay. He has trouble articulating so we figured this would help. We find the songs very entertaining and our son enjoys listening to the music, but it is way to quick for him. He has no time to repeat the words before the next word is being said. The good part is that we can print the entire CD and use the worksheets to help him with certain problems. Maybe other kids would have no problem at his age but I would have to say this is more for kids 5 and up."
5,Great! Great! Great CD!,I had the album but was never able to find this on CD. Wish these guys had made more mucic together. This CD is my favorite and the song titled This Old House will bring you to tears. It was expensive but I am happy that I bought it.
5,Jack's Back and all is well...,"I've caught the originals live a few times over the last few years and it is nice to finally see a new album from them- nicer still, the album is damn good. Buy it. These guys still got it."
2,So disappointing,"I got into TSOL a little while ago and I love ""Dance With Me"" and ""Weathered Statues/TSOL EP"". But TSOL has changed so much...maybe its their age. The thing that hurts the most is Jack's voice. He had such a great voice in the older days, it was a deeper booming voice that I've grown to love with songs like ""Code Blue"", ""Silent Scream"", ""Abolish Government"" and the rest. Even in the album ""Beneath the Shadows"", a wild departure musically, his voice was great. But in ""Disappear"" all he does is sing high. Most of the songs lack that TSOL flavor. Its really sad, but I still like this album. The guitars are incredible on it. Its just the lyrics and vocals aren't up to par. Needless to say, if you're a TSOL fan you'll appreciate this album as I do, but you'll love their much older stuff."
5,The Longest of the Best,"This is one of three volumes from the Modern Library covering the short stories of Anton Chekhov. These stories(all three volumes)were all translated by Constance Garnett, who introduced Russian literature to English readers starting in the 1880's. It has become fashionable to downgrade these translations amoung critics in comparison to modern translaters. However, I find the Garnett translations to be very good and enjoyable. I find I get the most from Russian arthors when I read two translatios of each of their works. I can recommend highly the Garnett translations of any Russian arthor."
1,The hidden product,"Every walk in car supply place carries Dura Lube products whether it be parts are maintenance supplies. You can even find the polish, but you can't find the car wash anywhere, but on line. My husband swears by it. We have decade old cars that look practically new except for the usual wear of debris scratches. This is an exellant product."
4,"Finally, a context for African American spirituality!","The last paragraph of the book is in my day timer as a reminder of who I am, where I came from and why and how I will always be. Ford's view of the African American story as an epic journey is liberating. He contrasts the intimacy between African diety and the common person with the separation between the western God or Goddess and their subjects. As someone who is struggling to understand the deepening division of black and white in US culture, I find this book very helpful in clarifying our root cultural differences. This also is a wonderful book to give a young person who is away from home or struggling with the questions of identity. As someone who has worked with children in multiracial families (particularly adopted children) who are struggling with a sense of place, I wish I'd had this book a long time ago."
4,Nothing about this piece of Art is Disposable!!!!!,"Since ""music man"" emerged in 1990 ive been a fan of ACE. His delivery is always on point, his albums are always top notch andhaving also met the man himself in person in DUBLIN when he played with ""punch+words"" i found him completely down to earth.This album is his finest hour, in my opinion. Every track is astight as you can get with such a high level of skill+intelligencein every rhyme. The beats are rock hard head nodders. With noreal weak tracks apart from possibly ""every other day"" and ""takea look"". No real hiphopper's collection is complete without this."
4,Take A Walk With The Masta,"After a 6 year hiatus, Masta Ace comes back(strictly underground) with ""Disposable Arts"" originally released in 2001.(Re-released in 2004 along with the sequel ""A Long Hot Summer"")Ace, a hip hop veteran bringing 14 years of experience to the table at the time this album was originally released. Listeners not familiar to Ace and his style of flow will easily compare his tone of voice to sounding the same as Eminem's, fortunately, there is not comparison to Ace. Ace keeps it simple in his lyrical display and his topics of discussion are always about everyday life as seen through his eyes. Disposable Arts also displays Ace taking shots at the mainstream and fake thuggery in such cuts as ""Don't Understand"". Several guest appearances including Punch & Words, Jane Doe, Apocalypse, Rah Digga, The Outsidaz and Greg Nice make this one to add to the collection and guaranteed to get a consistent play in any tape deck, record or CD player(whatever you prefer)."
5,Ace Always Comes Through With The Real,"I really, really, really don't like the guy that did the review for this album. I remember him dissin another cd that was a classic, I just really don't think dude is a hip hop fan. Ace comes through with a dope concept album that is real lyrics and nice production. Cop this if your a real hip hop fan."
4,Masta Ace - Disposable Arts,"About a 4.0-4.5 debut album. Of course I was feeling the production on this album, Masta Ace always makes sure he spits on the correct beats for his album. So more than half of the production is a plus. The lyrics, Masta Ace has some pretty good joints like ""Acknowledge"", good stuff. Lyrically he doesnt fail much. I still that ""A Long Hot Summer"" still defeats this album. But on the real dont sleep on this album, its worth the cop. Good overall. But not classic.My Top 5 Songs1.Too Long2.Dont Understand3.Take A Walk4.Somethings Wrong5.Acknowledge"
5,disposable arts,"First off I have to say that no hip hop album collection is complete without this gem. Nearly every song is brilliantly written and produced, the worst songs on this album, would blow away any of these weak, overhyped, overproduced joints MTv hits us with on a daily basis. I bought this CD @ the end of 2001 and thought for sure MA was going to make a HUGE comeback, I mean everyone of my friends, associates or whoever would come over and hear this ish bangin in my stereo was mad interested in knowing who this cat was, even the cats I chill w/ who don't listen to hip hop @ all loved this s##t. Masta Ace is a seasoned veteran, and EVERY cat into hip hop @ all should have this album. The only thing that I didn't like about Disposable Arts were the numerous skits between songs, but its still a 5 star joint regardless."
4,been a long time,"I have always thought that masta ace puts out a solid effort every time he steps to the mic this one might be his best yet, The underground movement is looking good right now. The beats on this one could have been better but the lyrics are on point. Do not pass this album by"
4,one of her best albums!!,i absolutely love this album! i dont skip a song while listening to it. her lyrics in this album are so strong and she sounds great! i definitely recommend this album
3,Never received cd,Even though I did not received the CD the seller have me a full refund. However I have had this CD before and HELLO its p!nk so it rocks. My favorite song is u and ur hand but the whole album is awesome u have to have this
4,Ok ... guilty pleasure.,"Pink is the type of artist I normally would buy but I got hooked off the radio. Unlike other pop albums, I was pleased to find out this wasn't a few good tunes and a bunch of filler. Each song is decent to good."
5,Great CD,"I really like this PINK CD. I got it mainly for the song ""Who Knew"" but I pretty much like the rest of her songs too. I also like U & Ur Hand and didn't know it was on this CD - so that was a good surprise."
4,I really enjoyed this,"After reading the majority of reviews I was thinking to myself ""Hey, this is Pink, it can't be that bad!"". And guess what, it's not. If you, like me, absolutely loved 'Falling' from her first album then you will enjoy this. Some of the songs show a much more subtle side of Pink - 'Who Knew', 'Dear Mr President' and 'Nobody Knows'. Those looking for Pink to be her flamboyant self will enjoy 'Fingers' or 'Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)', the second one definitely has a pop feel to it - despite the swearing (but, hey, this is PINK!). I actually enjoyed this album more than her others, purely coz I have only heard 2 songs released in the UK so far so the rest I could make my own opinion of without all the hype usually attached to a song (Was it Number 1, did it bomb in the charts etc). I thought that this showed Pink's singing versatily rather than her Punk 'Screaming' which has been more prominant on other albums. If you want to hear a mellow(er) Pink, this album delivers."
2,"Talented, but in the end a judgemental hypocrite","It's sad. Pink could be good, but makes a living by running around talking trash on pop stars. Not only is this judgemental, but it's very ironic becuase PINK IS A POP STAR. One more time...PINK IS A POP STAR. She is a marketing campiagn with legs. I would call her a sell-out, but I can't. You have to have made something original in the past....and then sell-out. REMEMBER...actions speak louder than words. I wish Pink would quit telling us how much cooler she is than the ""other"" pop stars, and show us by coming up with something original and outside of the box. PUT YOUR MUSIC WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS, AND QUIT TALKING TRASH."
1,A Dead CD from a Dead Singer in Denial About Being Dead,"Let me tell you something about this CD: BLAND, BORING, and TOTALLY FORGETABLE. Just a bunch of noise and insipid lyrics with no type of melodies. I've heard *way* better pop albums. Pink is no different and no better than anyone else out there right now. I don't even know why she came back- no one really missed her. Maybe I would take her seriously if she played an instrument and wasn't hypocritical and boastful. Why cry about ""the homeless in the streets"" in ""Dear Mr. President"" and then boast about your rims, diamonds, and someone's house fitting in your swimming pool in ""Cuz I Can""? Since Pink is concerned about the homeless, she should invite them to live with her in her big house and ride in her expensive whips. Skip this juvenile album from this Janis Joplin wanksta at all costs."
5,Fantastic i'm sure!,"I have not recieved my copies yet but i know that Alecia has made another great album.It's about time there is someone that is a role model that doesn't make you think you have to dumb yourself down to make it in this world.Like Alecia says you can be sexy,smart,and stand up for what you believe. I'm not sure what else to say about the album besides it's gonna Rock!"
2,Underwhelming,"I really wanted to write a scathing review, but I'm going to refrain because I looove Pink and I think she is totally rad, but this album is not up to snuff. I don't know if her label threatened to drop her if she didn't churn out a few hits or what, but the album is lyrically trite and melodically hackneyed-- the bad kind of pop. To me, her fist 2 albums were the good kind. Even the third had redeeming songs. (Duet w/ Peaches? Awesome.) She gets 2 stars instead of 1 for the duet w/ the Indigo Girls.And that is my nice review."
1,The cussing ruins this CD [Explicit Lyrics version],The cussing in a few Explicit songs simply ruin this CD. There is no wonder that the Clean version is more expensive. Our advise is to get the Clean version like you've heard on the radio.
5,Pink rocks,First thing this morning i woke up and bought the new album. it is absolutely amazing. I never thought any album could top the missundaztood album but this one is rite up there.. her song on track number 13 titled conversation with my 13 year old self is so touching. it made me cry. It was like she was talking about my childhood. I love her music because she writes about real stuff that everyday people go through.
4,Fantastic - I can't stop playing it!,"This is the first Pink album I've ever bought; now I will go and check out her earlier stuff. Terrific songs throughout - my favorites are ""Stupid Girls,"" ""Dear Mr. President"" (w/Indigo Girls), and """"Cuz I Can."" I also love the song she does with her dad at the end. Very touching. All in all, a great album. You go, Girl!"
4,I like it,"Pink may not have reached the heights she did on her second CD, Missundastood, but she comes close.Her lyrics again our straight to the point and speak of something besides sex, rare in pop music today. The track, Stupid Girls, is something that needs to be said, though I wish she hadn't 'become' a stupid girl on the video. Where are the young girls in this country who want to be more than objects?The CD also contains quite a bit of profanity. A wise man once told me that an intelligent person could express themselves without resorting to profanity. It's a lazy shortcut.Overall, however, a good work by Pink."
3,When shes good shes very very good......,"I have mixed feelings over this cd, i really like pink but this album could of been better.Tracks like the hilarious 'Stupid Girls', the incredibly funky 'Cuz I Can' and the brilliantly catchy 'Who Knew' get lost between the slower tracks, which are in no way bad but just dont gel together.I much prefer feisty pink to the miserable one.Stand out track?- 'Leave me alone (im lonely)' her best track ever in my opinion."
5,P!nk at her absolute best!,"I didn't think I could love a P!nk album as much as I did ""M!ssundaztood"" but I have to say that ""I'm Not Dead"" is an amazing album and that I may like it even better that ""M!ssundaztood"". P!nk is in a whole different league with this album. ""I'm Not Dead"" is one of the must-own albums of 2006 in my opinion. Buy it!"
2,Disappointing...,"OK, let's see, we have another foul mouthed ""entertainer"" preaching about how the President has screwed up. Well maybe she needs to walk a mile in the President's shoes. Seriously, those that live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones. I wish I could say this is something new, but it's par for the course for those living the Hollywood life. Nothing wrong with diagreeing with anyone, but how about making a difference instead of just complaining..."
1,"HELL,NO","I want to remind all reviewers that the only good music created by anthing with the name pink has the word FLOYD after it.I'm not dead is most certainly the worst album of 2006 by a mile.Each and every song is boring,pathetic and awful.Definetely not worth a listen.Get ON AN ISLAND from DAVID GILMOUR instead which is the best release of 2006."
2,not that great,I used to like Pink but I think her music has gone downhill. I also do not agree with her political views. She should keep her political beliefs and her music carreer seperate.
3,Censored,This is not the explicit version of the music... Don't buy the wrong one like I did (if you want the explicit one).
5,"NOT a ""stupid girl""","I turn forty this year and I drove down a country road with ""Stupid Girl"" goin' full blast! One of the best cd's I've heard in years...P!ink is brilliant!"
4,PINK IS BACK!,"i bought this album for the main reason that i know PINK's songs actually carries an important message... not the type of britney or the pussycat dolls..the tracks i like most are the ff:STUPID GIRLSWHO KNEWLONG WAY TO HAPPY (just plain AWESOME)NOBODY KNOWS (very true & meaningful...touching..)DEAR MR. PRESIDENT (very touching... the president should hear this definitely!!!)CUZ I CAN (perfect for an all girl gathering!! HAHA)U & UR HAND (background while ur getting ready for school!!)RUNAWAY (amazing lyrics)..the others i dont really like much, but probably will grow slowly into me..."
5,Pink,"This girl can sing!! She seems to keep getting better and better. I play this CD constantly. Her new CD Funhouse is great, too. You can definitely feel the emotion in her singing."
5,Well.......She did it Again,"Well, first she did it again.I'm not dead one of her best, and also my Fav.In this CD everybody can find himself, It has 14 tracks, in Rock, Pop, Soul genre. This album im sure that will not dissapoint nobody if they Buy. My rate is this1.Stupid Girls 8/102.Who Knew 10/103.Long way 2 Happy 11/10 (best track everrrr)3.Nobody Knows 10/104.Dear Mr.President 9/105.I'm not Dead 10/106.Cuz i can 10/107.Leave me alone(i'm lonnely) 9/108.U and Ur hand 10/109.Runaway 10/1010.The one that got awau 8/10...(so Janis Joplin style)11.I got money now 10/1012.Conversation with my 13 years old 9/1013.I have seen the rain 9/1014.Fingers 10/1015.Centerfold 11111111/10...THE BEST IN I'M NOT DEAD"
4,"Not Explicit, but says it is.","The album is great, but...Oddly my album was marked Explicit, yet the music itself is censored. Luckily the MP3 downloads are the true explicit versions."
5,Pink Rocks,"I had lost faith in my girl with Try This. I had to force myself to listen to that CD more than once to make sure that I really hated it as much as I thought I did. Because of that, I waited a long time to pick up I'm Not Dead.I wish I hadn't waited. I'm Not Dead is the best Pink yet. I love the bluesy parts, the rock kicks serious ass too. (Can I say ass in here?) I think we're finally seeing the real Pink. It is going to be one of my favorite albums ever."
4,"Pink ""I'm Not Dead""","Hmmm...when I heard the first single ""Stupid Girls"" I was afraid she may be selling (or already sold) out but then I bought the album! I was very impressed with her lyrics and her vocals. Besides ""Stupid Girls"" the song ""U & Ur Hand"" is funny and almost difficult to take seriously. The song ""Dear Mr. President"" with The Indigo Girls is what is missing from pop music. It does not matter what your political views may be, the passion and lyrical precision as well as the amazing harmonies from The Indigo Girls make this song fill the void left in pop music from superficial songs that have been released lately. The album is built around the idea of having each song have a different all-around sound, which works pretty well. I liked ""Missundaztood"" and this is right up there; because of its daring nature, impressive vocals, and personal lyricism.Best Songs: ""Dear Mr. President,"" ""I Got Money Now,"" ""Runaway,"" ""The One That Got Away"""
5,CD-I'm Not Dead by P!NK,"I LOVE THIS CD!!! Especially the song ""Dear Mr. President""!!! By far the BEST song P!NK has EVER written!!!"
5,HELL YES!!,"P!nk Rocks the house one again, any new or familiar fan WILL NOT be dissapointed. Dont pay attention to those who devalue her merely because she chooses to express something she is concerned with, and that she appears and lives her life in a certain way. We call those people superfical trolls, who have nothing better to do but bash everything they know very little of. About the CD....It's amazing. Every song is juicy, riveting, pumping...you wont be dissapointed. Lady Pink has returned finer then ever before, buy it now. I wont bother detailing the tracks, because they are subjective and carry different meanings for each person. Great album...wow wow wow."
5,"""I LOVE IT""","Pink is a wonderful singer, she puts her heart and soul into her songs especially in this cd. When you listen to her music it makes you feel good about yourself. Pink is addicting!!"
1,The music on this album is nothing special.,"The music on this album is nothing special. It is repetitive, boring, chaotic and annoyingly juvenile. There is nothing original about it.Most of the songs will be dated within two years, including the nasty ones with the vulgar cheap shots."
2,hypocrite,I can understand how Alicia Moore(Pink) was an outcast because I to was an outcast during jr. high/high school. But Pink shouldn't sing about being a Stupid Girl because Pink acts just like a stupid girl. Pink's immature and Pink dropped out of high school. At least all the other blonde party girls graduated from high school. Oh... Pink drinks and have done drugs in the past and she claims she not a stupid girl but a smart girl. She even admitted to the MTV Video awards audience back in 2003 that she was to drunk to make an acceptance speech when she won an award for best pop video. Pink is the stupid girl. What a hypocrite.
1,the worst this genre offers,"I dont know if it was the album cover or the album title or both that made me check this cd out. Now, in my mind, this is possibly the worst disc I have heard all year. I wouldn't call it music, not yet. I mean I would be surprised if people are actually listening to Pink. The music lacks substance, a logical conclusion of a rhythm, it sounds quite forgetful and nausea inducing. I don't think Pink should make anymore discs. Complete waste of my time. Want to check out some good pop? Keep looking. Anything but Pink."
3,alright,There are not many good songs on this cd. There are a couple though. I luv pink but she is kinda vulgar in some songs and I don't like it when she says g..d.... But it is what I ordered. It is in good conition. I would buy from this seller again
5,Stupid Girls,Love Love Love this album and Pink. Favorite song is Stupid Girls. The whole cd is awesome. Got 2 copies of this album.
5,P ! N K - I'm NOW a FAN!!,"I have to admit this is my very first P!NK CD. I was actually looking for Gwen Stefani's latest CD and happend upon P!NK's I'm Not Dead album/CD. And it was the last one left (and the edited version). And I have to say I play Pink's CD WAAAAAAYYY more than I do Gwen Stefani's. There's just 2 songs on the CD that I really didn't like as much as the rest. I am just blown away by her powerful songs and voice! I like a gal who speaks her mind and don't give a d*** what other people think! My top 3 Faves on this CD: Who Knew, Leave Me Alone, U + UR HandCan't wait for her Next CD!!!"
3,Not as great as I anticipated,"The attachments are great, though the motor that drives them is NOISY! If you don't mind that, the pumice attachment works well.I think the bubbles could be stronger, also. I previously owned a more simple model, made by a competitor, and was much happier with it for a fraction of the price. If the motor were to be improved, it would be a much more effective unit. Just my .02"
4,Such a treat!,"Truly enjoyable. I paid 49.99 but item went on saleless than a month later for 29.99 & Amazon.com honored thedifference. Point being, shop around & get a good price.My only complaint is filling/emptying the water is a chore asmachine is extremely heavy when full. I would suggest placing a rubber mat or towel under it while using as water does kind ofslosh around & spill at times."
3,I am pleased with this product overall....,"I received this for Christmas, and I first used it without the attachments, so I felt it was nothing special. I also did not like the fact that it does not have a line to let you know how much water to put inside. When you turn the unit on and the bubbles start if it has too much water it makes a mess.Then I got smart and decided to pull out the accessories. The pumice stone is nice. When you use your foot to apply pressure to the stone it starts to spin by itself, all of the attachments are motorized. The infrared light was relaxing. Overall I like the product, the manufacturer could make some improvements, lower the volume a little and it would have received 5 stars."
4,Great gift,"I bought this for my sister and she absolutely loves it... The only thing is that it doesn't actually heat the water. If you pour hot water in, supposedly it keeps it warm... but you can't put in cold water and expect it to warm up. that was the only disappointment. Other than that small detail, it's great. Feels terrific and is a great gift because I doubt most people would actually go out and buy one of these for themselves."
4,light and awesome,"I have always preferred light sticks, 7A being my usual preference, but the tips in this sticks just blow you away. You can get crisp notes with such feather touches that it feels like bliss. And when they hit the cymbals ... oh my!Go for it if you prefer the softer nuances of drumming, these are definitely not for the drum thrashers!"
5,The search is over for Mosquito Magnet Nets!,I was so happy to find this mosquito magnet replacement net and even more so a 3 pack. They are hard to find I searched for months.
3,These DO NOT fit the Liberty Plus,These nets are incompatible with the new Liberty Plus 3100MM. The description is incorrect (at the time of writing). The Liberty Plus is new this season and Amazon does not appear yet to carry the new larger net that the Plus model uses.
3,Fits ok,"i have the original liberty model so this fits, but no exactly due to the extra pocket. but there is not other anyway."
2,Replacement nets,I think I received the wrong nets as these are huge compared to the one that came in the machine.
1,Liberty Mosquito Magnet Review,"I ordered this product for LIBERTY Mosquito Magnet but did not realize that it was not the correct net for the LIBERTY PLUS Mosquito Magnet so cannot use. If you have a PLUS, do not order this product."
2,WAS THAT AN EARTHQUAKE????,"I thought this would be just the ticket for all of those little ... ok, make that BIG ... aches and pains that accompany life in the middle ages (y'know ... 30's, 40's, 50's, etc.), but I was mistaken. I couldn't adjust the thing DOWN to a comfortable level ... TOO MUCH MOTION for my shoulders and back. My muscle-bound husband agreed. We only use it for our calves and leg muscles now. So, unless you are descended from Atilla the Hun, save your money! Use it for massage oil and enlist the aid of your significant other!"
4,Great for an internet PC and Video Games,"I got this TV to use as a monitor for my computer which I use only for browsing the web. However, it has a component connection so I hooked my XBox360 to it and now run games in 480p. Video isn't that great though."
5,Python Injection Airflow/Mass Air Sensor - Nissan 240SX,"The part has been installed for about a month now and it works just fine. Loved the price, less than half of what Nissan charges. Only thing I would have wanted to know was the manufacturing date of this product. According to the box it came in, the product was made in 1998. It's freakin' a decade old! Like I said though, works just fine."
3,Was Hoping Laxatone would work better.,"The Laxatone didn't seem to help my cat much. Also, it said Tuna flavored and if it was, the cat would've liked it. He really hated the taste. Would run away when he saw me come near him with it. I had to disguise it every possible way I could. They say some cats eat it right out of the tube. Not mine! Probably won't get it again."
3,makes the hairball issue much easier for kitty,"I got this for my cat when she had a huge hairball issue. I felt so bad for her whenever I heard her heaving, so I really wanted to find something that would get rid of her hairballs once and for all.This product did seem to alleviate the problem a bit. My cat doesn't like to eat it on its own, so I have to thoroughly mix it into her wet cat food. After eating it for a week or so, her hairballs got fewer and smaller. It didn't completely get rid of the hairballs, though."
4,A smooth laxative for cats that works,"My cat is overweight, it's a breed thing,nothing you can really do about it. (British shorthairs all get fat when older). She gets in real constipation trouble frequently. We found that using Laxatone every day and changing her diet from dry to canned food helped quite a bit her constipation problems. Laxatone seems to be acceptable to cats, they don't reject it. Some cats even love it. Also, 1 cc. of Lactulose helps her by adding acidity and liquid to her colon, but we try to avoid these type of chemical medicines, so we used Lactulose very rarely on her.When in a crisis, we have resolved with children supositories and children enemas, found at Amazon too.Be very careful administering any chemical medicines to any cat."
3,Might be fine,"I can't get my cat to take any of this stuff, doesn't matter the brand or flavor. I mix it in food, which may reduce effectiveness and she tries not to eat the food.. This is a cat that eats every meal like its her last. Wish I could return ,but is too costly to ship back."
1,Goopy and cat does not like it,"This is thick/goopy and the cat does not like it, so I went back to the Laxaire product which is thinner and the cat likes it."
4,"My cat hates it, but it does work.","This definitely helps my cat with his hair balls and keeping regular, however he hates the stuff. Everytime I grab the tube he takes off. So...it works, just set aside 30 minutes to find your cat if he hates the taste as much as mine does!"
1,"Waste of money, cats hate it","This was a TOTAL WASTE of money for me. NONE of my cats would touch it. I would guess the only way to get them to eat it, would be to forcibly put it on their paws, which I AM NOT about to do, that really scares them."
1,It's half AIR!,"The tube I received was 40% air! My cat likes it just fine, but I can't say how well it works yet; this is her first day on this laxative.I had to pay $9 for this. Even though I'm an Amazon Prime member, I had to pay double: shipping this thing cost more than the product itself cost."
4,Gooey but works.,"I have a furry cat who tends to wake me up in the middle of the night trying to get up hairballs.Laxatone is gooey and I have to squeeze it from the tube into her mouth, but it works. I tried another one from GNC, but it was oily and didn't work."
4,The Perfect Cure For Multiple Tank Syndrome!,"Yes, it all starts with a ten or twenty gallon, at least it did for me as I've been keeping fish for close to 40 years. The Python is the Grandaddy of all syphon based cleaners an drainers. The extra 10 feet is just what I needed and easy as pie to intall. It's perfect for getting the additional length you may need. However the fittings can leak a bit. This has plagues Python for decades but it's really something a little plumber tape can fix right up."
5,This is the best of it's kind.,"I had purchased a python system a while back and it is by far the best brand of all out there.. I have also purchased a competing brand (we had a house fire and I lost my original) it was cheaper and I thought that these things pretty much would all be the same.. boy was I wrong. I have found a short python at a yard sale, so I purchased this extension for it.. still works perfectly. I would say the python will drain my tank in about half the time as the other brand.."
5,Great product!,The 10' extension was exactly what we needed to get the extra few feet that our Python hose wasn't able to reach. Hooked up great. No leaks.
2,Too Darn Salty,"This popcorn was okay, but it was WAY too salty for me. I think they should change the ""simply salted"" to say ""seasoned with salt"" or ""nuthin but salt"" something that indicates that this is a very salty product."
2,Not the best,"Natural didn't mean less fat or carbs, and it was pretty tasteless, actually! It did pop fully, not alot of unpopped kernel's, but I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase it again."
3,"Taste is good but too much ""mystery fat""","Taste is good but just not very ""Light"" at all IMHO. I peeked inside the bags of this creature and there is a large amount--looks like 3 or 4 pats worth of orangy-looking ""mystery"" fat there. You can remove some it and reseal the bag by folding over... which I recommend that you do with this, but it's a lot of trouble. Why bother the Orville Redenbacher 94% microwave popcorn is the real article but Amazon does not have it yet as of 1-1-2009. Look again later, their buyers will probably get it in soon. I really, really like Orville 94% Fat-free popcorn and it is the one to beat. Act II has about 50% more salt than the other brands for no apparent reason. Popcorn is a very healty snack if not adulterated."
1,Revue of Orville Redenbacher Natural Light Popcorn,"I love this popcorn! Unfortunately you didn't send me what I ordered. You sent me Natural, not Natural Light."
4,good for all except dieters,"Amazon's description of this items is wrong;it's 2.9-ounce bags (total 36 bags, 104 ounces)each bag yields about 4.5 cups of popped corn.it contains Palm oil, not Soybean oil, and theingredients are not all ""natural""; it contains anorganic Tocopherol preservative. Palm oil doesgive this popcorn a light buttery high note, butwith triple the Salt and fat-calories compared toLightly Salted Bearitos, dieters should avoid this.However it is a great alternative to full flavoredsalty microwave popcorn from most groceries."
5,Gotta Have it Natural!!!,"Having moved from a state where this popcorn was always available, we were aghast that no one carried it in our new area! It appears that very few here like this wonderfully natural tasting, lightly salted, lower calorie popcorn, but preferred those that heavily tasted of thick butter with lots of salt and coats the mouth with film. This popcorn pops fully, leaving no kernels unpopped, and doesn't need any additives. Ease of ordering and prompt shipment make this a wonderful way for those of us who just have to have it! Thank you, [...]!"
1,Too little for way too much,"Redenbacher makes great popcorn, but this is ridiculous. Go to your local Cosco and buy a box holding 36 bags of this for $12 or less. Sheesh!"
5,It was stolen.,I received this product in good condition all the way to Iraq. I enjoyed one box and then Iraqi police officers stole the rest of the package when inspecting my cargo. So it must be really good for those guys to know to steal it.
2,NOT 3.5 OZ. PER BAG!,"Wrong info. under Product Features. It claims each bag contains 3.5 ounces. I received my box of 36 bags today, and every bag is only 2.9 ounces. So, instead of the 126 ounces claimed, they only send 104.4 ounces total. The difference is 7.44 ounces, or enough for another 2.57 bags of popcorn! It would also be nice if one could call up the Nutrition Facts of food products on Amazon - then I would have known O.R.'s Natural has 300mg of sodium per serving, compared to O.R.'s Light Butter at only 190mg of sodium/serving. Calling Natural ""Simply Salted"" implied to me less salt, and so I find it misleading. Posting Nutrition Facts would eliminate ambiguity and make things clear for customers."
3,one of my faves,I take microwave popcorn seriously. This one is very good (3 stars). I'd rank it third after Newman's Organic Natural (5 stars) and Pop Secret Homestyle (4 stars).
4,Great,Product worked and looked as advertised ! They fit on my motorhome and matched the factory latches .I would recommend for anyone in need of luggage door latches !
5,Price was right,"I bought this three years ago for around $80. Asking gunsmiths around town and going to other websites the actual price for tritium night sights is around $120. I was nervous that these were knock offs or something but they aren't, they are the same thing other people buy for another $40. Had a gunsmith install them on my Sig p229 .40 cal and they work with like a dream, I average 1 inch groupings at 30 yards. Furthermore, they work very well at night, the sight picture is very clear and crisp and since its tritium I never have to worry about it fading. Great product. The fact that it was so cheap is a testament to Amazon."
2,This book is a collection of fiction stories,"This book is a collection of fiction stories, each 1001 words long. The stories were written by members of a writing group in the UK. The title is actually ""1001"", not ""1001 Exclamations"" - the text ""1001 Exclamations"" appears on the back cover. (The ISBN is the same.) The book has nothing to do with exclamations.I haven't read the book so feel free to ignore the star rating; this entry is meant to clarify the ambiguity."
5,Grab a bottle and hold on!!!!!!!!!,"This is clearly the best compilation of music ever put together in history. I happen to be of the younger generation and I'm saying something as stunning as this. You better believe it buster!! There's probably some of you new country enthusiasts out there reading this right now thinking I can't believe this lunatic listens to that old garbage. Well your dad gum straight I do. There are still some traditionalists out there and I'm one of them. This should be a building block (a platform if you will) for new singer\songwriters to grasp, cherish, and use as a stepping stone to boldly go where many new artists dare not tread."
2,Very elementary information,"If you know nothing, this could be a place to start. If you know anything already, this won't help much."
2,The same story over and over and over,"(Unabridged tape version) I was curious about Geronimo, so I picked up this book. It started well, setting the stage for Geronimo's rise. Adams lays out the geography and politics of the time very well. But then the story begins to get very dull.Every battle and every agreement is painstakingly set up. The author notes that the white man shamefully broke every promise (Geronimo was a clever tactician when he broke promises). After a few of these, it gets a little dull. No, very dull. That may, in fact, be the history of the Southwest, but it doesn't mean that it is interesting reading.Good setup, poor payoff. I would recommend finding another biography."
4,TWINK - 'Think Pink' (Twink Records) 4 1/2 stars,"This 1970 reissue of the Pink Fairies drummer / vocalist is nothing short of true brilliance. The first five cuts here that include ""Ten Thousand Words In A Cardboard Box"", ""Dawn Of Magic"", ""Fluid"" plus two more certainly get the brain cells a frying. The rest of the disc shows just how diverse Twink can get. On cuts like ""Mexican Grass War"" or ""The Sparrow Is A Sign"", one might honestly believe they originally came off of another record. 'Think Pink' was Twink's first solo outing,as this psych gem is an absolute must-have. The fellow musicians that gave Twink a hand on this lp include Pretty Thing's rhythm guitarist John Povey, Deviant's bassist Honk, Tomorrow's John Wood and T. Rex's Steve Peregrine Took (R.I.P.). An underground UK classic from the 1968-72 era."
3,Links with kinks,"3 1/2This tweaked psychedelia doesn't all stand the test of time, but what hasn't faded into drug humor (particularly in instrumental explorations) can transcend hazy presentation to hint at the influence freak-folk bands like Animal Collective thrive off now."
5,PBS Never Fails!,"Inspector Lewis Season 2 is just as well performed and written as Season 1. As an avid british crime drama fan, I've watched several series and this ranks right near the top of my favorites list. A bit lighter than Trial and Retribution, which I would also reccomend if you are into British crime drama, this series is a continuation of the faithful sidkick of Inspector Morse. Lewis has seasoned into those rather larger than life shoes, with his own style, and excelled spectacularly. Superb acting by Laurence Fox a welcomed addition to the crime investigation duo. Well done!"
5,Great!,"I was a fan of the Inspector Morse series, and Inspector Lewis lives up to my expectations! Great stories and plots too."
5,wonderful show,"This is a must see detective series. I'm always anxiously awaiting the next installment. It is well written, and the characters are well formed. It is a must see."
1,ridiculous propaganda,"Carly Fiorina's tenure as CEO at HP was one of the worst performances in the history of Silicon Valley. HP's stock dropped over 50% (despite having consistently grown since HP's founding in 1939). Her biggest ""accomplishment"" was the HP-Compaq merger, noted as one of the worst mergers ever. Egomaniacal, power-hungry, and clueless...just like the author, apparently."
2,NOT Perfect Enough,"Carly has finally left HP in disgrace. She's been lambasted on the cover of Fortune, the Wall Street Journal, NY Times, and Salon. What people inside HP have known since 2001, is finally becoming mainstream.People are beginning to wonder whether HP will survive. Inkjet cartridges are all that's left making a profit.But this book is worth more than 1 star because it contains some information important for HP history.Buy ""Backfire"" first, then read this."
1,So much fluff - like the great woman herself,"Carly Fiorina took over HP in July 1999. Some interesting numbers since that time:Lexmark shares up 40%Canon shares up 16%Dell shares up 3%IBM shares down 23%HP shares down 60%(Look it up on money.msn.com)Ms. Fiorina also entered saying that HP should dump the printing business in order to concentrate on e-commerce. 3 years later, that business was being described as HP's crown jewels. She also claimed that what HP needed was more accountibility (see numbers above). And we're supposed to be interested by her views on business?"
1,NOT Perfect Enough,"This unevenly written book reads like yet another vehicle for Fiorina's ongoing self-promotion efforts. After a skewed retelling of the 60 year history of leadership at HP, fully 25% of the book is consumed by a blow-by-blow account of the cat-fight leading up to shareholder approval of the aquisition of Compaq. She repeatedly blames HP's recent leadership ills on Lew Platt yet there is so much more that could have been written of Fiorina's view of the leadership at HP such as why the executives of struggling businesses (computers, services) were retained when their peers in the vastly successful printing businesses chose to ""seek opportunities elsewhere"". Don't waste your money on this one. Anders panders way too much to Fiorina's rhetoric."
4,"What a voice. Almost masculine, but yet, so sexy","Sade Adu obviously didn't have a very big budget to work with on her videos that represent this album, but it's the music that we must appreciate to have a love for Sade.This album featured her debut hits:""Smooth Operator""#5 March 1985""Your Love is King""#54 June 1985and the video favorite:""Hang on to Your Love""Her videos were really low budget but very essential to her DVD video collection ""Life, Promise, Pride, Love"" which you can see her videos starting to look more professional with a larger budget. I didn't care for her other albums that much. To me, her songs all started to sound the same, but I do enjoy seeing her videos. Mostly the later one's with her lesser familiar songs.On the CD of ""Diamond Life"" she does a great cover of Timmy Thomas's 1973 hit ""Why Can't We Live Together."" Even you will agree that her voice was meant for that song. It sure would be nice to see her DVD video collection released in High Definition Blu-Ray."
4,Sade fan forever-- rainy afternoons were made for this,"My Profile: No qualifications as a music expertIn the mid 80's there was this fabulous radio program (on AM) that displayed an unsual repertoire of music ranging from jazz (Manhattan Transfer - Al Di Meola) to Klaus Schlutz !!.. anyway, I usually studied in this time and this was great music to have as a background.. then I hear Sade.. what a refreshing change of pace.. like hearing brazilian contemporary..yet this had its unique style.. not strident.. sensous.. appealing..the music to fall in love and be in love..Much like Marisa Monte.. Sade will be style you will keep as your favorite"
5,I like sade a hole lot.,"If you havent noticed I have all of her CDS.She is just so spontanious.So sarcastic.So great.Cool isent it,well got to go so catch you later. your fan chevon the beautifulist princess in the world.bye bye."
5,YES,"YES...I believe she is the supreme songstress. She has made some really good albums. I just love Sade's music. There's nothing bad about this album, if anybody thinks there is."
2,"Try to get the original 1984 version, the last one SUCKS!","I found a supposedly ""New remastered edition"" of Sade's ""Diamond Life"" on sale for less than 10 bucks. OOPS! Great mistake! When I tried to return it, the CD store was already out of business, and the copy is one issued in the Netherlands which is marked INTO THE BOOKLET as ""2000 Digital Remastered Version"". The whole album HAS BEEN RE-RECORDED with new arrangements! The digital sound is quite good, but the new arrangements made for 'Smooth Operator' REALLY SUCKS!!!"
3,Solid and Celtic,"The earrings are solidly constructed, don't dangle much, don't sway, and are a nice touch for most outfits. That said, I wouldn't have paid $30 for them if I'd seen them in a store. The quality is good, and I've never had any problems what so ever with the Amazon collection, but they don't look as high quality as they should."
2,don't buy waste of money,The earrings look nice in the pictures. But the ones i got did not look as nice. you can see the where they put them together and the color is dull on those spots. and I don't think mine are that shiny when I got them
2,Talented actors wasted.....,"Talented actors wasted in this movie. This story is so predictable that you can have the plot figured out in the first 10 minutes. I bought this DVD for my daughter because she is a big Star Wars/Mark Hamill fan and wanted this movie for that reason. Mark Hamill is made to be the sterotypical nerd in this movie. The many mini plot lines that make up this movie have been told often. Nerd falls for popular girl, bully beats up nerd, angel comes to earth with a mission to get someone's life back on track, nerdy girl falls for ""wrong guy"" jock, nerdy girl puts on some makeup and becomes pretty and popular, ect.. Every one of these overused plots is woven into this movie. There is nothing offensive in this movie, it is just not very interesting."
3,Great Service,"Shipment took a little longer than expected, but that is ok. I wasn't to happy when my DVD came and the description said it was New. DVD case was all bent up and had slices and a hole in it. DVD was ok though."
4,Very helpful and humorous,"I used to be a nervous wreck. Making my oral presentation for my undergraduate honors thesis almost did me in. My sister gave me this book to be funny, but I read it to learn.I found this book helpful, not only for letting me see group presentations in a different light, but also for the insights it gave me for other social situations."
3,Needed more examples,"I am a trainer and thought this book might help me with my presentation skills, but it seems to me it is geared toward sales presentations. I found some useful tidbits here and there, but overall it wasn't worth my time.I also think the book needs more examples of what to do correctly. It gives plenty of ideas of what not to do, but few ideas of what to do instead. Only one or two chapters really give good ideas on ""fixing your weaknesses."""
3,Could be better.,"Tights look really cute. However, the quality could have been better. They are not too stretchy (I usually wear S/M but these were a little tight on me - especially around the ankles). The color and transparency are comparable to cheap stockings. I bought a much better product elsewhere."
4,titanic story,My son is all about everything Titanic. He loved getting this book. The packaging and timing on delivery were awesome. I would recommend this book to titanic enthusiasts.
4,Interior Design Reference Manual,This is an important book to read if you are studying for the NCIDQ. It is basically a good review of prior Interior Design studies. Well written and clear. A good lesson in how the NCIDQ quesitons are written.
4,Interior Design Reference Manual: A Guide to the NCIDQ Exam,I think the book was helpful... it broke down the sections of design well and offered up just enough information about everything to be a good guide / refresher from the days I was in school.
5,Interior Design Reference Manual: A Guide to the NCIDQ Exam,"Exam Sections I, II, & III correspond to the three exams that are administered to Interior Design license candidates, a requirement in the State of Illinois."
2,Not Nearly Walking With Ghosts,Somehow I discovered David Wright's Walking With Ghosts and was immediately smitten. I decided to try another and bought ThreeSixZero in the hopes of finding another Walking With Ghosts. Wrong. I've never been able to get my brain around this one and it was enough to scare me away from buying anything else by Wright. I'm going to assume that he caught lightning in a bottle with Walking With Ghosts and move on.
5,Simply a Classic!,"This is probably one of the finest albums i've ever heard! It is everything Tubular Bells should have been and wasn't! 15 varied tracks effortlessly joined together; a huge tapestry of sound and styles. East meets West, dance rhythms and ambients sequences, Celtic and tablas, the beautiful, the exotic (and erotic!), the dark and the atmospheric. All of this together shouldn't work, but for the most part, it does! And it does so because the composer treats all these elements as if they were natural to the music and the compositions. It is that subtlety that sets David Wright apart from the rest! So, there is no ""look at my world influences"" or other indulgencies here. It is simply about creating a musical soundscape that draws you in to it and ultimately satisfies on just about every level. An out and out Ambient/Electronic Classic!"
2,whats with the hinge???,"The peace symbol itself is a nice finish and a perfect size. However the hinge next to it is way too big and wide and long, and makes for a very awkward look on the belt. Looks sloppy. So now I have to take it to somone to remove the hinge and make it smaller and put it back on!"
4,Does what it is supposed to do.,I think this product is alright for what it is advertised as and what the price you are paying for. I just wish you could get a one of these things that is as strong as the ones you find at amusement parks that really shake your feet up and give instant tingly sensations on your feet. With this you can get the tingly sensation on your feet but after you have your feet on it for a longer period of time.
2,HoMedics AK-3 Foot Pro Ultra Luxury Foot Massager,It looks alot better than it works. Very bad vibrations.
3,Neat Idea - But...,"I bought this for my wife, and while she was excited about the idea and said it helped with sore feet, in reality she hasn't used it much. Maybe she is just too busy, or maybe it just didn't cut the mustard."
3,"A good idea, poorly executed","The problems with this unit are:1. The electric cord is about a foot too short.2. The vibrator is underpowered. You'll use the device on the high setting all the time, and still not get the relief you need.3. The unit is so light, that it moves around on a smooth floor (it's okay on a rug).Overall, the impression is one of cheapness."
1,Don't waste your money on this model,"This is, by far, HoMedics' WORST foot massager. Don't waste your money. I just bought their ""Therapist-Select Ultra, Personal Reflexology Foot Tapper"" model for about the same price and it is INCREDIBLE!! I tried the AK-3 Foot Pro model out at a store and it was nothing more than a vibrating footstand that achieved temperatures that could barely be described as luke-warm. The model I bought by HoMedics is a little tougher to find but it's worth the search. Trust me, I'm a teacher and I'm on my feet all day and this foot massager does wonders to relieve stress."
4,Good product for the money,"My husband bought me this massager for my birthday. I'm an elementary school teacher, and my feet are always tired and sore.In response to a few other reviews here, I must admit that the machine doesn't heat as much as I'd like, and the cord is about a foot too short, but I really do consider this a good value for the price.The foot pad area is large enough to accommodate feet even bigger than mine (!), and the massager, especially when set on high, hits all the right sopt, just on the bottom of the arch, and that sore spot beneath the toes. After a good 15 minutes of ""regular"" massage, I like to curl my toes under or contort my feet sideways, to get even more coverage!No, this isn't a miracle cure for tired feet. But it's a nice, relaxing end to a hard day. I recommend this product to anyone with realistic expectations of its benefits, but who still is willing to take a chance on a nice, relaxing product."
2,Meh...,It's not all that special. The bumpy things on top don't feel good on my feet. The heat is not that hot. It makes too much noise... I'm not impressed.
2,Doesn't Really Massage,"My mom bought this for me years ago, and I must say... I use it perhaps once a year or less.It's a great concept, but putting your feet on a hard plastic box that vibrates VERY intensely just doesn't seem to work. There's really no massaging that's done. It's just the vibration which-- for me-- is way too much. By the time I'm finished, my feet usually are very tingly and strange-feeling.If you're really intent on getting a foot massage, I'd look for something that works a little better."
3,Bought as gift and return...what a hassle,"The produce was as advertised. It was a gift and the receiver already had one. The issue was the return. Had to call and get ""authorization"" to return. Then had to wait for and print email authorization. I completed paperwork and sent it in. I assumed my account would be credited. Days later I received a call asking about the return...do I want a store credit, account credit etc. This was not in the paperwork. It cost $12.95 to return US post and am still waiting for my account to be credited. They are ""decidng"" if I am also subject to the 15% restocking fee that I wasn't made aware of at time of purchase. All this hassle for a $39 foot bath."
2,Stopped working in 2 months,"I was happy with it and used it every day. but it did not last long. It stopped working 2 months after I bought it, since it's over 30 days, couldnot exchange it. Just ordered a KingKong Big Foot Massager from Costco for $99, hope the more expensive one will last longer."
2,Cheap product...beware!!,"I used this product for about 2 1/2 months before it crapped out. Now it won't even turn on. I'll admit though it was nice to have under the desk while I worked but now it is a worthless piece of plastic. The heat function is nothing great either. Just a bunch of red LED lights for all I can tell.If you want to buy a foot massager, it might be worth spending an extra 10 or 20 bucks. Although the HoMedics one when it works, isn't bad for the price...it's really a cheap product and will not last."
1,Lawn Mower Vibrations instead of massage,"The whole unit vibrates, makes your feet numb. It is Very Noisy (too noisy). We returned it, since we purchased ours at Wal-Mart.So glad I did not mail order this.Ugh :-("
4,Pretty good,"After buying this, me and my partner started using it pretty regularily. It's a nice little machine that leaves you feeling it even after you've finished using it. Only downside is the amount of noise it makes while you have your feet on it."
1,Not a massager,I am very disappointed with this item. A massage should involve some type of pulsation hitting the bottom of my foot to actually stimulate blood flow and loosen up tight muscles and joints. All this machine does is vibrate. On low I barely feel anything and on high you get a slight tingling sensation but not a massage. The heat mode is adequate but I was looking for a massage.
5,I LOVE IT,i have owned my foot massager for a good while now and it is awesome they could have made the vibrations a bit stronger but it is still a really good foot massager
2,Loud,"It warms ok, not great. But the worst thing is, the massage is LOUD! I work at home, in my basement, where it gets cold, and was thrilled to get this to keep my feet warm, and was excited to get massage too. However, I can't use the massage feature while I am on the phone - it is way too loud. And there is no control on the heating element, just on and off. A disappointment. I still use the heat feature, but also wear thick socks!"
2,vibrating feet,just returned it. Too vibrating and became tingling like neuropathy. Did not relieve my tired feet.
3,Close but not quite,"I reviewed the pinouts of the factory harness in my 07 Nissan Frontier SE CC pickup vs. the harness provided by CarXTC. One or two of them were off. It was easy enough to relocate the leads within this harness, to match the factory. From there, it was plug and play."
5,Great slippers!,"When my husband first felt these, I had to show him the price before he believed that they weren't rabbit fur! They are THAT soft! 3 months later they are still going strong, and I wear them whenever I'm home. I'm thinking about buying another pair just to put away in case these fall apart!"
2,Not what I expected,"The slipper is warm, but the bottom is hard and when you walk with them they don't ""stay in place"", my heel comes off. Not worth it."
4,Aaahhhh....Almost as good as having my boyfriend rub my feet,"... It is simply marvelous. The different settings allow you to customize your massage. And the heat....the Heat feature is beautiful. My office is an iceberg and this helps to kee pme warm. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is the noise. It's not loud, but I work with a room full of computer programmers, and they like total silence here. I would highly recommend this gift to all my friends and family!..."
4,Interesting read for those who have visited the mountain,"I read this book as I was sitting in a hut on the way down from Mount Kenya. As I walked out I had a new appreciation for the surrounding vegetation, imagining what it would be like to pass through with no trail. This book was an easy and interesting read that added a special dimension to my Mount Kenya trip. Am eager together hold of the video of it at some point."
5,Great testimony to the human spirit,"Tremendous story! Should be a major motion picture! The language is a little awkward, from time to time, due to a combination of the fact that it was written 50 years ago, by a gentleman who is not a writer by trade, and who is writing in a foreign tongue. All in all, it does not detract one iota from this remarkable story about the will of the human spirit to seek adventure, and ultimately to be free. A classic ""why did we climb it? because it was there!"" story."
4,All-in-one,"This book is very handy for the Neil Gaiman fan who doesn't want to collect every scrap that has his name on it; it does that for you! Various introductions, miscellaneous poems, and the American Gods web log are all compiled here so that we don't have to try to find it! It's interesting to see Neil's conversational tones and to get a glimpse of what he really finds worthwhile."
4,Excellent Starting Point,This book was recommended by our adoption counselor. I found its advise to prospective adoptive parents practical. The anecdotal portions of the text brought to life the child-centered issues that adoptions should deal with. They made me cry and smile. I am recommending that our families read it in a hope to better educate them on what a positive journey adoption can be.
5,Very Solid Clips,I was impressed by these clips. Unable to find what I needed at Home Depot I found these on line. When I received them and then used them to mount a 4' x 4' mirror they turned out to be better than I had suspected.
3,not bad,The quality leaves much to be desired.Walmart had a sale one week following my purchase and those were of much better quality.It always pays to research these things and take time making a purchase.
2,not so good,Honestly speaking this rug should be $9. . my friend spent $20 and got a much better one from ikea. would not recommend to anyone.
4,"Excellent value & quality, and convenient","I used to purchase other major brands, but they are so ""flaky"" and crumble easily, it worsens my allergy problem. I found ""Puffs"" very sturdy yet still soft. Moreover, the price is good from Amazon, and it delivers right to our doorway. I ordered this several times already.We have these boxes in all our rooms. Only reason I do not give 5-star: I wish it would allow me to choose more variety colors for the boxes, so I could match the color for each room.Overall, I am very happy with ""Puffs""."
4,"Good, but not perfect.","This is a really nice wine chiller. Unlike the other person who reviewed this, I have no problem placing it in the freezer. That is exactly where I keep it. But I'm not trying to sell my book. I actually would have given this five stars except the inside of the cooler is discolored. Still, the outside of it is very nice and it does exactly what I want it to do."
3,"Great looking piece, but of only passable utility","This is a very nice looking (and heavy) wine chiller. One puts it in the freezer and then it will help keep chilled wine from warming up too quickly outside of the refrigerator. It does an ok job of this with more typical slender wine bottles, but wider bottles (like some champagne bottles) will not fit - and that was one of the reasons for getting this in the first place. Also, it takes up precious space in the freezer for possible long periods of time between enjoying wine, unless you can always anticipate having wine later in the day and remember to put it in the freezer to be ready for use later."
5,Marble Wine Jackets Work,"Serving Temperature is one of the five factors under your control that affects the taste of wine. Tools that help you control serving temperature add to your pleasure. A marble wine jacket will keep wine that's been previously brought to its best temperature at that temperature for about the length of time that it takes for two or more diners to finish it.Marble jackets are better than ice buckets because they don't lead to all that annoying dripping. They are less versatile than the silver or printed sleeves that you can store in the freezer and use when you carry wine to a restaurant or host's home. On the other hand, they are less ugly and even fit right in with some table decor.Lynn Hoffman, author of New Short Course in Wine,The,and the properly chilled bang BANG: A Novel"
4,Great buy,"I am very pleased with this poster. Of course Sex and the City is my favorite show, and the poster looks great in a sleek black frame I bought for it, right above my bed."
5,"Best, book on Feng Shui on the Market",This book has changed my life. In the six months since I bought it I have increased my income by 300%. My career has skyrocketed. I have more clarity and purpose in my life. This book can help YOU to achieve ALL your desires in life. It isa valuable tool that you can't afford to be without.
2,it was a supplement,"I've been reading a lot about feung shui. I immediately fell in love with this book when I read this at BORDERS. But when I actually got it and read certain chapters that pertain to my needs, I didn't see how valuable this book came to be any more. It was a supplement to my other book ""move your stuff, change your life"" but if i didn't have another book, this book wouldn't do any good for me. I liked how the author went into the intention with feung shui and how you can use it to empower where you want to go in your life. But, I'm sorry, I ultimatley can't say that this book did wonders for me because it didn't."
4,Purchased for a family member.,"I purchased this book for my mother and she can not stop talking about this book. What I have heard from my mother, this is a great book. It is easy to understand and read, also, it is easy to stop reading and then start back up again later. Great book for beginners."
4,To be honest,"I checked this book out from a local library and it is the first fengshui book I have read. A little later, I started reading a few other books. Certainly, the humorous writing and easiness to read make me immediately realize that I should have paid more attention to this topic before and rearrange my place and office. Did some routine work following advice. Then I started feeling some beneficial changes. Just in a few weeks! Well, I will move on to more readings and practices... and thanks for the introduction. Nice job! I even thought about mailing them a red envelope with some coins as suggested in the book.In an eastern culture, we need patience, intention and thankfulness to fullfil our goals."
2,House of crystals,"This books solution to every feng shui problem is to hang a crystal, if you want rediculous crystals hanging everywhere this is the book for you!enjoy"
3,"Good, but not Great","I am a little mixed about the book. One on hand it is excellent for giving down-to-earth, easy to understand Feng Shui principles. On the other hand, it fails to mention many important aspects about Feng Shui itself, such as the Elements. The book talks about what to do when the energy for a certain room is negative because of certain placements like the kitchen or the bathroom. But it fails to talk about the elements of each room and how to balance them. In fact the book recommends bamboo for nearly every ""treatment"", but that is really impractical because it doesn't even explain the elements. The elements of water is briefly discusses, but the others: fire, air, metal, and wood arent even mentioned. I was very discouraged when I read the book and found this out. Please if you are looking for a book on Feng Shui, find another one."
2,A bit of a letdown...,"After reading ""The Complete Idiot's Guide to Feng Shui,"" I was hungering for more knowledge. What a disappointment to purchase this similarly titled book and find the ""faux"" Feng Shui packaged for the masses I'd been trying to avoid. This book deals with the Black Hat sect approach to feng shui, as opposed to the compass school. It certainly has merit, but it's like trying to predict the weather by the way you ""feel"" as opposed to using a barometer."
1,NOT MY CUP OF TEA !!!,"No loupan, no feng shui. As simple as that can be, feng shui is about physics, intuition and scientific data that corroborates the effects of the application. Coordinanting the right angles to create a contrast with the energy we give and receive. In this book the author does not corroborate any of his data, and assumes that feng shui is the same for everyone, dividing areas of the home in different areas of prosperity. I have certaintly learn to be more carefull of what a buy, and understand the unreliable information in the market about feng shui. Feng shui does work when a scientific approach is attained to fulfull harmony for the environment and myself, but this book is far from been scientific or systematic in any way."
3,Average book,"1. I sent two e-mails to David Daniel Kennedy and didn't get respond. 2. He advises one thing, L.Too advises opposite thing. Who is right? I'm confused."
4,Magnetics applied to pain therapy...,This wonderful aparatus may help reduce arthritis pain. Although is simple it can give the most of the nature to your body...
4,Sony Ericsson Active Case,"The sony ericsson active case is excellent for working out, although it does look somewhat bulky on your arm."
4,Well Worth the Effort,"Thinking this gem was a soundtrack collection, I was still pleasantly surprised at the quality of the 'tunes. Of course, some familiar and not-so-familiar tunes were arranged differently than originally heard by sci-fi fans, but the effort and love for music shows. My personal highlight was the more driving version of the theme from ""Escape from New York"", which made the disk for me, and the version of ""Amazing Stories"" was quite close to the original by John Williams, which at the time this was released, was extremely hard to find on CD. A worthy effort by a group with an obvious love for sound quality and arrangement. Familiar music with a new twist! Nice!"
5,Fantastic.,"I saw these guys open for Death Cab For Cutie in Ft. Lauderdale and they were amazing! When i saw them scheduled to play again near me, i rushed to see them, they played another great solid show.The CD is very catchy and addicting and has a good amount of diversity inbetween songs.don't be a pirating (...), buy the cd."
1,Beautiful clock which keeps lousy time,"This is a beautiful outdoor clock, but unfortunately it keeps lousy time. In less than a month after purchasing this clock it began being slow. The batteries have been changed 3 times in less than 2 months and it still will lose an hour every 5 hours."
1,really 0 star but cant,yo snoops old shiznet is better thats all they is snoop when he was tight his old stuff but not half as good they got potential but they dont know how to rap they suck my b@lls
1,Prohibition,"Another great effort by Ken Burns, sadly for the hearing impaired, it's not available with captioning. Like Burn's ""Baseball"" and ""Tenth Inning"" the deaf and hard of hearing community is left out.The movies are captioned for TV broadcasting, so why isn't the captioned version available to the public?At the same time, many, many great titles produced and sold by PBS do not have captioning as well. It's bad enough the hard of hearing have to wait to see new DVD releases months after their friends have seen them in theaters, but the PBS movies will never be captioned for them to enjoy.Simply stated, all movies should be captioned, and PBS should be first in line to make that happen."
1,Christmas gift.,"I don't know how to rate it because this was a gift for Christmas, and the receiver hasn't watched it yet. I personally liked it when it aired on TV, but this CD is yet to be used."
5,Great story telling,"Ken Burns is a great documentary film maker and he give us an in depth look at what was one of the greatest fiascos in our history! Filled with facts, humor and the eye opening truth, Prohibition is amazing!! Highly recommended!!"
5,Ken Burns' Prohibition,"As expected this documentary by Ken Burns is both informative and entertaining. It is an excellent synopsis of a governmental attempt to control behavior of its citizens through legislation, and the reasons why it proved impossible."
4,Prohibiton is part of America's history,"When the the presentation is done by Ken Burns you know its going to be good. This presentation is as accurate as possible and very alluring. Obviously, Americans love alcohol and they'll do whatever it takes to get it..today its America's teens that are drinking underage and following a similiar pattern."
5,Burns At His Best,"This is the definitive work on the Prohibition era. Ken Burns is at his best covering an infamous time in America's history. I have watched and read a lot on Prohibition, but this 3 part series will become the work they judge others by on. The years 1920-1933 changed your country forever, and not necessarily for the best and the impact of the 18th ammendment is being felt to this day. This series is outstanding and should be viewed by every American.A lot of the credit must also go to the excellent narration by Peter Coyote. He has a wonderful voice and it is used magnificently here.I would watch this series over and over again as it is a fascinating, detailed and extremely entertaining piece of television and everyone associated with it should be congratulated."
5,fantastic documentary,this is a great documentary. it tells the story of prohibition from start to finish. if you like history- this one is a must. i have watched it several times and enjoyed it each time.
2,Not Worth the Pursuit,"I really enjoy Kim Baldwin's books, but unfortunately this is not one of them. When it comes to a love story with a lot of action, I'm usually willing to overlook some minor illogical plot points, but in this case, there were just too many things that seemed forced as well as implausible. First, we are asked to believe that a highly trained, hardened assassin is willing to put her own security on the line to rescue a stranger and bring her back to her bunker. Second, the two women fall deeply in love after only a handful of exchanges. Third, how is it that Hunter has managed to build a very high-tech, modern bunker into the side of a mountain without drawing any notice? Four, why does Scout take so long to make her move? And finally, the resolution at the end of the book was way too easy and tidy for me. I don't relish writing bad reviews, but you should save your money and time and read something else written by Baldwin."
3,Not as good as Breaking the Ice,"I read this because I really love her story, Breaking the Ice. The plot for Hunter's Pursuit is a little further off my usual genres, but I really liked the way the characters in BTI were developed, so I figured I would give it a try. Unfortunately, these characters are not as well fleshed out. Like BTI, the characters are limited by circumstances to a very small setting. However, in this case that setting is so small that it limits their responses, resulting in a telling voice with a lot of character thought, rather than letting us get to know them through their actions.Baldwin does come through when it comes to avoiding he Lesbian Must Die theme so common, and almost makes it to the point of keeping their sexual identity in the background, keeping in mind that they are stuck in a tiny little place together and attracted minds will go there regardless or orientation.All said, still a decent light read."
4,I thought I needed a new net,"I took a look at the net in my Defender the other day and it looked dirty, worn out, and just plain used. I found this item on Amazon at a really good price; $20 bucks cheaper than some other sites. I received the item promptly and immediately replaced my ""old"" net with no interruption in mosquito catching. One of the other reviews said that the nets were washable (they weren't on my Liberty). I tried washing it and was amazed at how clean I was able to get it. I'm glad I have a spare, but now, I'm not sure I needed one."
1,Does Not Work on Windows 7,"After spending almost an hour on hold with Lorex's support, I am told that they have *NO* USB products that work with Windows 7. They say it works with XP, but I have no way of testing that."
5,Excellent Country Music Collection,In this CD you find a great country music collection at that time.If you love country music you have to get it.
2,Not one of her best,"Anne Stuart can weave a wonderful tale, whether it's a contemporary or an historical. But Heart's Ease is an early Stuart that misses on a lot of levels. There are so many you've-gotta-be-kidding moments, when serious misunderstandings could easily and quickly be righted with a simple explanation. But that doesn't happen with this hero and heroine -- each decides he (or she) isn't going to make the attempt because, obviously, the other person wouldn't listen to facts. I also find it hard to believe that a research scientist would not attempt to defend herself against allegations that she had falsified test results, a claim that, if true, would end her career. It was also unsettling how these two almost-strangers, who hated one another, kept coming together physically. If you want to see how far Ms. Stuart has come since this early work - and she certainly has developed into a wonderful writer - then this might be an interesting read."
2,"Long on Theory, Short on How-To","This book appears to have been written by academics. It contains a great planning strategies but very little in the way of practical information about how to actually design multimedia instructional materials. The accompanying CD is weak, mostly text and a bunch of supplemental forms and planing document templates. It isn't worth the money if your looking for a ""nuts and bolts"" guide to design."
5,E-Learning Manager,This is a great book. It presents the instructional design methodology clearly and concisely and links these to e-learning development. It is obvious that the authors do this for a living and write from first hand experience.
4,worth every nickel. . . even if it is a laser print !!!,"According to the publisher's colophon, this edition is a digital reprint and it shows!! You'd think for $150 they could give us real ink. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about the price. This work is invaluable. However, THE TEXT IS RIDDLED WITH ERRORS. There are missing particles, punctuation errors, and a host of other typos. The bold italics are inconsistent and there is at least one passage of the root text that is just plain garbled. A scholar with a reputation like Stephen Hodge should have his work proofread BEFORE it goes to press. The ""Mahavairocana Tantra"" is clearly not for the tenderfoot, but one should be able to read this text without always having to wonder: ""is that another typo or did the author really mean to say that."" Unfortunately, the sloppy presentation does not inspire confidence in the translation."
5,yep,the comment made by Hank von Helvete by itself is worth more than the entire cd...buy this now!!!
4,"OK, but could be better edited","I used this as a text in a class in a Computer Engineering Technology program. The book is rather good. It is easy to understand, if you have a background in analog electronics. There were lots of examples, which allowed you to work out exactly how to build something using digital electronics. The only really bad thing that I could say about this book is that the editing could have been better done. The diagrams were often several pages away from the text describing them. If the book was reedited, or the reader could get used to this flaw, I would recommend this book to someone who wishes to learn to design digital circuits. It is not an in depth text, but a reader with a little creativity can be well on his/her way to actually building digital projects by the time they finish this book,"
1,Truth Mixed In With Eckankar Dogma,"There are truths within this book, but the lies far out weigh the truth. The Mahanta (Harold Klemp) is also known as the ""Word"" and ""Lord of Hosts"". He sits at the right hand of SUGMAD (not God). Actually, the God of all religions (except those of heart and emotion; 2nd Plane God) is a 4th Plane God. The Mahanta, of Eckankar, exists on at least the 14th Plane (Heaven). It would be nice to know these little details when Klemp is spinning his web. The book sounds nice on the surface, but there is just sooooooo much more that is left out of the recycled information in this book.Save your money. If you've read one book by this author you've basically read them all!"
5,love it,I just love any and all David Allen Coe music.He just has a style all of his own & I've listened to his music as long as I can remember
3,"Great product, but no updates without maint contract","This router is more robust and flexible than most out there for the price. It has features such as dual-WAN (properly executed, unlike most consumer dual WAN products out there), it has excellent firewall features, and it includes Cisco SDM, their configuration tool that helps avoids misconfiguration leading to security holes and functionality problems.HOWEVER - Cisco is IMPOSSIBLE to deal with. They require a maintenance contract to be purchased with a Cisco reseller simply to download a software update. It infuriates me that I would have to pay money to someone for doing nothing but displaying a Cisco logo. I am perfectly able to apply updates on my own without having to pay - and Cisco should catch up with the times. This practice of requiring maint contracts for any downloaded updates is a major negative and steers me to look for other products."
5,My Girlfriend Made Me Read This Book!,"Ever have a girlfriend who keeps trying to make you read magazine articles and books that she finds interesting? Well, that's my girlfriend. I can't tell you how many ""relationship"" articles I've had to read, or how many ""chick lit"" novels I've had to read. Or pretend to read. Then she gave me this one. I was sure I was going to hate it. One paragraph in, I knew I was going to love it. And I did. It's a masterpiece."
2,off the deep end,"I must admit, I bought this book because of the cover. Too bad I actually read it, too. It goes nowhere and not very fast. Why did Ham's wife hate Shoogey from the get-go? Who knows. Diane, why did you edit out Angie's pertinent character development? Diane?"
3,Sour Punch Straws,"I'm a huge fan of most Sour Punch products (I like the Sour Punch bites better than the straws, but lately they are very hard to find). So I got excited when I saw that I could order them on Amazon.com. However, when they got to me, they were on the slightly stale side and were a little hard to chew. Otherwise they still had their flavor. Definitely will not order the straws online again!"
1,"stick to the boxed sets ,you get more for your money","while this set is ok,and doesn't look bad you get more band for your buck by getting the box sets. they have extras,out-takes, and many other things that make them a much better deal!"
3,Good Value - Good DVD,A good deal on a few of the Riffleman series - it will make you want to buy the series collections.
5,A sweet story about a little rabbit,"Children's books about animals are one of my favorites to review -- especially when the main character has a mind of his own :).The book, ""While You Were Out,"" by Ho Baek Lee, is about a little rabbit whose owners forget to lock the door to the balcony. When the little rabbit discovers this, she goes exploring throughout the house. While inside, she finds a lot of fun things to do.MyParenTime.com highly recommends this book -- it's short sentences and simple renderings make this story very enjoyable for young children. The ending is sure to leave a trail...pun intended :)."
2,Inadequate,"The book is an easy read enough for an introductory text, but the details for many chapters are really inadequate."
4,a suitable textbook for year one students,"This book is written to the appropriate depth for a year one course at university level. Some figures and chapter summaries are helpful in summarising the concepts and mechanisms. I think the chapter for ""movements of molecules across cell membrane"" is well written as some of the definitions given in other textbooks are incorrect. And this book has a cool webpage."
3,This book is comprehensive with thorough illustrations.,"Human Physiology is comprehensive enough to be easily read. The Illustrations cover most of the confusing topics, but not clearly enough to make it completely understandable. I had to supplement some of them with other texts. Therefore, I only give this 3 stars. I believe that this is a good introductory book for students studying Physiology. The University of Michigan uses this book in the third year of pharmacy school, in kineisiology and the first year of Dental School."
1,You can't use most of these routes to ride on,"This book shows many routes of 70, 80 or even 90 plus miles, and all of them are point to point with the mileage computed ONE WAY. The author gives no hint of what you are supposed to do after a 90 plus mile ride over tough terrain. Turn around and ride back? Have someone follow you in a car? A much more pratical book is one of the Falcon guide series, which either show a loop route, or, if it is out AND BACK, count the total mileage, not just one way. Duh."
5,Successful Ordering Products From Amazon.com,"I received the CD in great shape, and everything was A-OK. I have never had a problem with anything I've ordered. The CD sounds great-I love it! Janice P."
1,Save your moeny,"This pamphlet is desperately in need of an editor (sites/cites, it's/its, their/there, punctuation, etc.). Breezy, informal style doesn't work well in written form, causing some ambiguity and confusion. To quote them in a review of someone else's work, I must say that this work is ""not original"" and there's ""not much here."" However, if you are completely new to the topic, this might be a start. Save your money and check out web sites or ask your librarian for suggested readings."
2,Not for kids who are struggling to learn their facts!,"I bought this book thinking it might help my daughter learn her multiplication facts. However, for the strategies explained in this book to help, you'd have to be a math whiz, and also know a fair number of multiplication facts to begin with. For example, this is the strategy for multiplying by 6: ""Six is pretty quick to do, just multiply by 3 then 2. If this sounds like too much trouble, triple first before you double!"" (!!) Now, this might be handy if the book taught an easy way to triple, but the strategy for multiplying by 3 is: ""Three is as easy as can be, if you triple what you see. In other words just add it thrice, this simply is one more than twice!"" Simple, hunh? I would have given the book 1 star, but I liked the illustrations."
4,Good review for kids who have memorized their math facts,"First: memorize the math facts. I recommend Learning Wrap UpsMultiplication Wrap Upsand daily practice. Second grade is the right time to start.Then have fun with this book, that illustrates handy shortcuts and mental tricks for the times tables.Greg Tang gets your kids thinking."
2,Don't use it anymore,I used to think this helped get more gas mileage and I put it in all my cars. But I don't really believe that anymore and the last couple cars I haven't used it and they run real well anyway. I mean it hasn't hurt any of the cars I used it on. It's just that other people with the same kind of car were getting similar performance without it. And some of the recent articles I've read are somewhat skeptical about it's claims and I have no proof that it did anything but cost me money for not much benefit.
3,HoMedics Spa Clock Radio...Dim,"The sounds are wonderful--just about everything is wonderful except one main thing that does NOT work for me. It states on the box and insert ""Large digit, LCD display illuminated by glowing backlight."" I cannot see the display and it is NOT back-lit. The LCD display area is deceptively small. I'm truly disappointed that it is useless to me."
1,Garbage,"Don't bother with this alarm clock. Unless you like having to reset the time every week, you'll be happier with something else. This clock cannot keep the correct time no matter what you do."
1,Poor product quality,"Batteries corroded within the unit upon arrival, clock doesn't work. What a disappointment."
1,"Don't buy it here, they have them at Bed, Bath & Beyond","The clock arrived with the rubber feet falling off all over, and a rusted battery, and the hour button to change the time did not work. I returned it for a replacement and still have not received another one. I am very disappointed with this whole thing. In addition, the cost of the clock was $19.99 and the shipping was $20.00. I specified that they send it the cheapest way possible and i guess this was their solution. This company has serious problems."
2,NOT for snooze pushers,"If you enjoy a gentle, gradual awakening while pushing the snooze button a few times, do not get this clock. Once the alarm goes off and you push snooze, the sound machine part does not automatically come back on, so you go from a reasonably nice sound, to an awful buzzer (whose volume depends on which volume you had the nature sounds volume at), to dead silence. Plus, the angle of the snooze button (on the front rather than the top) makes it hard to easily push with one hand. Most of the buttons are small and hard to use.If you enjoy waking up with a jolt, this is for you.A previous reviewer was totally correct about the Wind sound being scary! (I picture being in an Antarctic blizzard or something) The Rain/Waterfall sounds were ok but I didn't like that I could easily pick up on its loop/pattern, which didn't quite make it the inconspicuous ""white noise"" that it was intended to be."
1,Not Good,"I don't like this product. It is complicated to figure out how to operate, the dials for the radio stations and volume move too easily when groped at in the night, the radio sounds bleed over into the nature sounds and it picks up cell phone signals or sounds from outer-space -- hard to tell which but annoying and jarring in the middle of the night.The nature sounds are very artificial and the ""wind"" sound is downright frightening. Hard to relax to the sound of a hurricane!The dispay is so tiny and dim it is nearly impossible to see from more than 12 inches or so.Overall an awful product."
4,Great Product!,"The Sound Spa Clock/Radio is an all-around great product. It's 6 soothing sounds, Falls, Wind, Brook, Rain, Night, and Ocean, are very relaxing. I didn't really enjoy the Falls, it sounded like static to me, but the other sounds were great!I use Ocean or Rain to help me fall asleep, and since there's a timer, it doesn't have to be playing all night. Then, in the morning I wake up to the Radio. You can also wake up to a generic alarm buzzer, or a soothing sound.This product is one I'm really glad I bought, and at it's affordable price, it's definitely worth purchasing."
3,Not bad for the price,"Like most sound machines, the sounds choices are limited and most have a very noticeable cycle. The brook sound actually had a click at the end! However, the ocean and white noise had a good cycle.Unfortunately, only after a year, it broke. Now, I'm looking for a better one with more sounds."
3,The sounds are repetitive,"I suppose this clock is ok for the price, but the repetitiveness of the sounds makes it useless for relaxation while falling asleep. With the lights out and nothing else going on, it takes surprisingly little time to realize that the sounds repeat every six seconds or so. A real babbling brook may be relaxing but the same glub-glub-gurgle-BLOP--glub-glub-gurgle-BLOB--glub-glub-gurgle-BLOP over and over again isn't.On the other hand, I do like this clock as a part of my waking-up routine. I have this thing start up a half-hour or so before my regular alarm clock. It's a nice, gentler way to wake up.Another thing -- this clock must be plugged in to use most of the features, but it uses batteries to keep the time. It's nice to have one clock in the house that isn't flashing 12:00 when the power goes out!"
3,Compact but not for traveling,"This clock radio has the expected features:snooze button, wake to alarm,to music,to sound of choice,timer to fall asleep to music or to sound. The sounds quality is not good; fair to poor. I like rain and ocean best. Radio quality is good on am and fm; I like the telescoping antenna which gives the compact unit a feel like a radio-remote control device. There is a removable piece on the back so unit can stand upright or lie flat. Only the clock will run on battery so the power cord is needed for radio and sound making the total weight impractical for an overnight bag. There is an area for AA batteries, but no mention in the literature as to why. Instructions are for AAA batteries and power cord only."
2,It works great...for a little while.,"When I first got my Sounds Spa, it was great...for about two weeks. After those two weeks of use, however, the sounds just stopped working. The clock worked, but the rest didn't. My guess is that it's not meant to be played continuously for the entire night, which is what I did. Maybe if you just use it for 30 or so minutes at a time, it would last longer."
4,Ok Product,"I own this product and like the fact that it has both nature sounds and a radio. But the one problem I have is that the stand that hooks on the back of the product broke after I dropped it off my night stand, and the HoMedics people were very so rude so now I am stuck with a broken stand, and I now have to be careful how I set it down. Other than that I recommend this product. My neighbor borrowed this product when she had her baby and it put the baby right to sleep with the nature sounds. It is great for people of all ages."
2,Not all I was expecting,"This is an odd item. I got it for the sounds (to cover noise in my bedroom), but they are less than I was expecting. For example the sounds repeat every 5 seconds. Once I heard the pattern, it started to be annoying in stead of relaxing. Also it requires 2 AAA batteries EVEN WHEN you have it plugged into the AC outlet. This wasn't what I was looking for."
1,Broke within minutes!,"I bought this for our guest room, primarily for the sound spa. My daughter visited, and set up the machine. She got a soothing sound for about 30 minutes, but then it quit. She assumed that she had set the timer by accident, but could not get the sound to come back on.She tried the next morning, but gave up. I tried several times over the next two days, but could not get any sounds, either the sound spa or the radio. The clock was working, and the ""sound"" button would cause the display to show different sounds--but not a sound from the machine! The ""on-off"" button (which is supposed to light up when on) does not seem to be working. I tried all new batteries, plugged in or battery power, etc., but it is not working at all.I am very disappointed. In my own bedroom, I have an inexpensive Phillips clock/soundspa that has been working flawlessly for at least 10 years, playing sounds all night, every night! I wish I could find that model for sale."
2,small display,"pros:- good radio reception- better sound quality than most clock radios at same pricecons:- clock display is too small, hard to read in either of the clock's postions, laying down or standing up.- natual sounds really do sound like static."
4,"Great Idea, Repetitive Sounds","I have this clock and think, overall, that it's great. I like being able to go to sleep to the sounds. Some of the sounds, though, are repetitive, i.e., after a few minutes of listening you get tuned into the beat of the birds chirping in the ""woods"" selection.Other than that, it's easy to use and sounds great. The radio is better than any clock radio i've ever had. The sleeping to the ocean is my favorite part."
3,"Good theory, quality not there","This is the second Homedics Sound Machine I've purchased. The other one broke after a week so I got this because of all the features. It's in my babies room. All the sounds sound very similar and not that soothing. The stand has already broken. We also couldn't figure out how to get the sound to stop coming on at a certain time everyday - not easy to get all the features to work (or stop working) unless you can find your directions. All in all, it's ok but I prefer my stripped down Conair by leaps and bounds. In all fairness, it's difficult to find a sound machine you really like; my parents have been looking for one forever.Additional note: The sound feature has stopped working after about a year of use."
1,Wish I had a better experience. . .,"I wanted to like this clock, but after a few months, the radio started randomly turning itself on at all hours of day or night. Additionally, the alarm would sometimes reset itself. I tried to figure out if something else was interfering with it but was never able to identify the problem. Then after less than a year, the radio came on and I was unable to ever turn it off again without cutting the power. At the same time, the display went blank. It's too bad, because other than the fact that it became useless after a few months, it was perfect."
1,"The second time I used it, it went dead","This was not all that impressive a sound machine when it worked, but on top of that, it died last week when I used it for only the second time. The power is there, and the light comes on, but it's deader than Julius Caesar and won't make a noise. For an item this large and bulky, this thing just isn't worth it."
3,What time is it?,The sounds are OK and they do the job of blocking out the neighbors barking dog but you can't read the time day or night. When I wake in the night I like to glance at the clock to see how much more time I have to sleep. Will forget it with this clock. You have to put your face right up to it to see what time it is. Very disappointing. I think I'll go back to my old clock/radio.
1,You can barely hear spa sounds,I purchased this sound machine strictly for the spa sounds to use in my daughter's room. I cranked the volume all the way to the highest setting and still could barely hear it. I thought I might be doing something wrong but re-read the instructions and checked the radio and the volume seems to work fine. It doesn't seem to matter whether the unit is laying flat or standing up. I am returning this item.
2,Poor quality,"I bought it almost two years ago and it worked okay for only 6 motnhs or so and then I started having problems with sound. ALso when I turn volume wheel, it makes weired noises and volume control is gone almost. Clock display is so small that you can not read it in the morning (though I have 20/20 eyesight). Though it is still working after two years and I daily wake up using beep alarm. I tell you, having pleasurable sounds in home is a nice idea in theory but after some time you just do not use it.and how thehell you setup this rating/voting ON ? While giving review, I do not see any option like this."
1,Bad button design and unreliable tuner,This clock radio suffers from several problems.1) The button design is such that you must grab the radio to keep it from moving away from you when you try to hit the on/off and snooze buttons.2) The tuner gets dust in it very quickly and it becomes very hard to tune to a particular station...ditto on the volume control.3) The actual clock has small digits and poor lighting. This makes it hard to see in the middle of the night.On a personal note the nature sounds didn't wake me up anyway.
1,Not Worth It,"I have the same problems with the display, etc. as everyone else mentioned, plus I would like to add the following:1. Buttons require too much force to press down and are awkward;2. Radio and nature sounds share the same volume knob, which means if you turn the nature sounds down a bit and your alarm is set for radio or buzzer, you may not hear your alarm in the morning (this happened to me and made me late to work);3. The only way to 'un-set' the alarm is to cycle through all sound settings;4. The Snooze button and the sound On/Off button are right next to each other and similar in shape, meaning you can very easily turn the alarm sound off instead of hitting Snooze as intended (this also happened to me).I strongly dislike this item and am sending it back. The sounds and FM reception are OK, but it is very poorly designed and not worth the money."
2,Broke after a month,"It was nice while it lasted, but it broke after about a month of use. The sounds loop after about one second, which on some of them gives them a rhythm that I found hard to sleep to. But other sounds are good and restful. I haven't tried to get any kind of warranty service, but I wouldn't buy it again."
1,Stopped working after only a few days,"We bought this to try and help our baby sleep - friends told us white noise might help. Well, it seemed to help our baby to sleep for the few days that it worked. Only 4 days later, none of the white noise functions work anymore. Tried changing the batteries, that didn't help. We are hoping to return this item to the retail store where it was bought, since the $5 handling fee for the warranty is too much to spend on a $20 dollar item."
1,Lousy product.,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift. The clock is very nice, but has alreadystopped working. When purchasing something it should last more than 60 days.Unfortuneately product is only returnable for 30 days."
1,bad product with a side of deception,"I recieved my package today, and to my major dissappointment, the sound quality produced by this nature alarm clock is horrific. After listening to my new clock for the first time a buzz developed that I have been unable to get rid of also. Probably the biggest dissappointment though was the fact that the alarm clock that I got was not the one pictured. The buttons on the top are different, and there are no dials on the left side. It appears like I was sent an earlier model then what is pictured, so buyers beware."
1,not worth cheap price,"this is my second one, don't ask why the second. i've had this one for 6 months now and the clock is broken and the sounds are terrible. trust me, buy something else."
1,"sorry, but this is junk","I don't like to be negative, but will be just possibly to save anyone else from wasting their money. I agree that the sounds were good, but these are available on so many other products. If you used it only for the sounds, perhaps you won't be totally disappointed. Similar to a previous reviewer, my stand broke as well (and you basically have to lay it flat without a stand - it would be tough to repair given it's construction). Furthermore, the radio tuner is terrible. I receive a strong signal to a particular station, but it kept drifting in and out of static on this radio because the tuning band is so narrow. That was really irritating. Finally, the clock did not even keep proper time; it was off about 15 minutes per month. Hope these comments help."
1,Save your money,"I bought this unit to use only for the sound function.I have ringing in my ears and need white noise playing in the background in order to help me sleep. I use the sound ""Falls""I am already on my second unit after 10 days of use. The 1st unit was returned after 5 days because the unit will not stay on all night even though the timer is set to ""0"" , which according to the owners manual, will keep the sound playing continiously until you manually shut it off. However, it turns its self off every night, sometimes after 3 hours sometimes it will go 6 hours and then shut off and when it does, I wake up ! Both units have done this so I have no faith in this product.I am going to return this unit (the 2nd one for me)and get my money back."
4,I have not had any problems....,"Owned this for probably 4 years now. I bought it for the sounds, so I don't use the radio or alarm. Display still works, no problems.It is cheaply made. I have trained myself to grab it and push the off button in the morning. Otherwise you'll simply push it away. The volume and tuner are hard to use, but since I bought it for the sounds (which I think sound fine) that is not very important."
1,Not up to the task,"Unfortunately, this product was not a good option for blocking out outside noise so our little one could sleep. Although it should stay on contiuously through the night (if set to) it would turn off sporadically causing disruptions in sleep rather than a good night's rest. Also the clock is poorly lighted for viewing in the dark."
1,Didn't work,It was broken when she opened it on Christmas morning. Pretty unsatisfied. The quality didn't see very good for $25 even if it did work.
2,Bad on off switch,"I have had the radio since Dec 8th and a week ago it started going off and then on and then off again and then on again. It looks like something is wrong with the on/off switch. Since this is a low cost item, it would probably cost me just as much to send it back. I am now believing that I should buy at home and not online. I won't buy this product again."
4,Had for many years!,I am on amazon to purchase another Homedics sound spa alarm clock. I received one for a gift many years ago and it lasted probably 7-8 years. It worked well for me and I am planning to buy another because I miss it!
2,you get what you pay for,"This clock radio was ok until the clock display faded out. Now I'm unable to see the time,so also unable to reset the alarm to a different time. Not much use for a clock that doesn't let you tell time!"
2,Cheaper than it looks.,"I bought this item for my husband because he often has trouble relaxing and getting to sleep. It looks like a flimsy plastic radio and while it has several different sound settings, the all pretty much sound alike, because there's static drowning out all of them. If you really want a sound machine, I would suggest going with a pricier Sharper Image type model."
3,needs better speaker,"Works fine, good idea, but when the volume is turned up, the speaker has a lot of distortion. It was cheap, but I would rather have paid a few more dollars for better sound quality."
2,Can hear radio sounds when sound machine is on,"I used to love this machine. As time went on, however, when I listen to the ""ocean sounds"" to fall asleep to, I can hear the noise of a radio station in the background (when the ocean sound lulls every few seconds). Nothing that I have tried to do to fix this problem works (I could handle static, but even if I tune the radio to an AM station with no reception, when I turn on the sound part of the machine, I can still hear someone singing or talking in the background). Currently, I have jammed the radio tuner halfway between AM and FM which worked for about a week until some random station started playing again. Also, if the alarm mode is set to ""off,"" the sound machine will still turn off at whatever time the alarm was last set to (which will wake up the light sleepers among us)."
4,Honest Account,"I really enjoyed reading this book, as it is an extremely honest account of her life as she sees it. Both good and bad. I didnt expect to read about her marriage for example, but found that her points of view were very interesting and it possible to get a better and more complete understanding of the person. She is not just someone who can run really far...Its an easy read and eventhough I do not share a lot of her points of view, the book is very hard to put down and it is fascinating to attempt to understand what drives her extreme performance."
2,Huge Dissapointment,"Who knew the key to ultrarunning was anorexia? This book was horrible from start to finish. Most of it was about her personal life, very little about running. I was so disappointed in this book. The writing was poor and poorly edited. A total waste of trees, imo."
3,"Enjoyable, but...","This is an enjoyable read, even if you are not a runner, but the kindle version has so many typos that it becomes very distracting and annoying. It's obvious that no human eyes ever proofread this book!"
3,pass on it,"This is the first time I've felt compelled to leave a review. I'm planning to try my first ultra event next spring and my quest for inspiration, motivation and information hit the wall by chapter two in this book. I found her writing to be flat, with a selfish edge that was most unappealing. I found the added quotes from her boys and others to be a feeble attempt to add a rosy hue to a womans story that is less than inspiring. Finally, I'd like to say that while Pam's many accompishments are impressive, and I do appreciate her efforts to level the playing field among women and men, by making herself appear ""ok"" with anorexia and so much talk about herself as what appears to be less than nurturing mother she doesn't do the female athlete justice."
3,Running on Fumes ...,"I really wanted to like this book more. My copy was poorly edited and a long first person stream of consciousness rather than a coherent narrative. At what point does healthy exercise become a twisted psychological addiction? Got me! The struggle with anorexia was interesting and gives credence to those who see ultra-distance running as nuts. I came away feeling sorry for Pam Reed, a running scarecrow..."
3,"Somewhat useful material, which begins with CIA hatchet job","Katsuichi's investigation is useful when used as a historical complement to (and NOT a replacement or refutation of) Iris Chang's ""Rape of Nanking"", which courageously and correctly examines the top-down imperial framework that made the genocide possible, as well as exhaustively detailed firsthand accouts. Former CIA officer, thinktank chief and CIA asset/apologist Frank Gibney attempts, laughably, to discredit Chang, and UTTERLY fails. It is easy to see Gibney's agenda: a limited hangout that pins the genocide on 1. ground troops under pressure and 2. the ""right wing""."
3,itchy and smelly!!!,"I am in school for massage and I wanted to have some at home relief from constantly using my back muscles. This massager does provide some relief, but it does NOT feel even close to a real massage. The heat is weak, and the pad smells like chemicals, and makes my skin itchy. After sitting on the pad for 10 minutes or so, my back does feel relaxed, but I am all itchy and my clothes smell!!! I would not order this online unless you know someone with it so you can try it out. It was definitely worth the $49 I paid for it, but it is usually $117."
2,"Functions well, but oh that smell...","The massager and heat work well. The strength of the massage and ability to select which areas to massage was well done. However, the seat has a strong odor that transfers to clothing and didn't go away even after a week of hanging from a hook to air out. I ended up returning the unit because of the odor."
3,enjoyed this product,I purchased this item and I enjoy this very much. The price was fine and delivery was timely as well. I enjoy the versatility and the many options that this massager also provides. The fact that it allows me to specify which body part to massage was a plus too.
2,not satisfied...,"didn't like it at all... but for the heat it generates for the lower back. It's like some springs moving under ur back...give u some tingling sensation, but do nuthin' for u! I have realized that there's no point in going for cheaper substitutes of the cool 600 dollars massage chair that you see in shops... if i fancy a massager again, i am gonna spend my money on that chair."
4,Back Problems ???,"I purchased this item for my spouse a year ago and he has found it helpful for back problems. The heat, combined with a gentle massage, seems to be quite comforting, for everyday pain. I can recommend it as a non-invasive therapy."
1,Just vibrates,"I thought home massagers would have goteen more advanced in the past 20 years, but this is no different than a product my mother had in the early 80s. It just vibrates. You are able to change the way it vibrates (strength areas, speed, different motions), but it does nothing for me except make me itchy. The heat isn't very warm and the product is smelly. It smells very chemical like. I wouldn't recommend this. I returned mine."
4,heaven is a place..a place where nothing ever happens,"except when you lie on this puppy...It has a nice built in shut off so you can use it to fall asleep and not worry. A little short for me, but I can't fit in an airline seat either. For an avg size person it should cover the whole body.I give it 5 stars for what it does...the only reason I gave it 4 is that it is packed in the smelliest plastic that permeates the product. They say to ""air"" it out for 24 hours...more like a week for the smell to totally go away."
2,For the Absolute Beginner!!,"Living in North Carolina, I purchased this product expecting some insight on ""Successful Strategies"" approaching our small,tight,rhodo choked mountain streams. Please note as an experienced angler I wasn't expecting secrets to be revealed, but what I received was a 101 version of flyfishing, period. No advanced strategies to approach bluelines, nothing. I DO WANT TO MAKE A POINT that this is not a direct ""stab"" at the author or his wife. In fact, they are one of the foremost professional guiding services in all Southern Appalachia and their knowledge is seldom surpassed! I just feel this product targets only the fundamentals and nothing else. To the beginner, I give two thumbs up! For anyone else, I'm sorry, but it's not worth it."
3,"Covers a Lot of Ground, Decently","Churchill covers the tanning of many different types of animals, using many different methods. This is the good and the bad of this book. No other tanning book I know of contains so much varied information, and for this reason its a good one to have. However, the techniques are not covered in much detail so it is challenging for the beginning tanner to be successful using these instructions alone.In reference to the previous reviews written here. I agree with the first two (look like they are written by the same guy?), in that if you are wanting to tan buckskin, this isn't the best book. However if you are wanting to do furs, the books mentioned below don't cover them (I'm the author of one of them)...and this is your best bet."
1,Not Worth the Money,"I was very disappointed with this book. He talks about the generalized steps to do tanning, but he lacks good step by step information for beginners. Its a good first book to read, then find another book with more detail as to how to actually do the procedures. He only has two plans for crafting with leather, and I think he should have added more. I wouldn't advise you purchase this book unless its your first and you want to understand the general procedure of tanning, then find a better book with more details."
4,"Good variety, Lots of useful information","I just finished tanning my first 3 skins based on the information in this book. They came out great. I highly recommend this book to the beginner who wants to learn different techniques for different hides. It covers tannning techniques for a large variety of skins. NOT JUST BUCKSKIN!!!! Refreshingly different from all those other ""my way is the only way to tan a dear hide"" books. Lots of different formulas/options."
1,Out of date,"The book is old and out of date. The author skims the surface of topics, but not enough details. Maybe if he updates for current world of Linux he can drill down more."
4,As always MZB world of Dark over holds you spellbound,"As always Dark over holds the reader spell bound to the end, wanting to know more about the lives of the characters and the wonderful world the domains"
3,Not a bad little book,This book has all the highlights in a short and factual way. I compared what they had to say with a much larger detailed book and it was right on.Downloaded onto my kindle and highlight the areas I want to visit on my trip....can't beat it for free!
3,Adequate Reference Tool,"Straightforward, concise recommendations for a visit to Oahu. Not nearly as informative as ""Oahu Revealed"", but the price is right."
3,Well....,"This book was hit when I was baby-sitting. The kids loved it. They settled down straight away and I had to read it three times, just so they could hear it again and again. Definatley a good kids book."
2,Counter Argument,"I too read Professor Shapo in law school, and I fundamentally disagree with the earlier review of this book. Didn't Professor Shapo teach that the law is an evolving creature; if so, it looks like the law in this case stopped evolving around 1975....while a huge fan of A Nation of Guinea Pigs (I have read it twice), I found A Duty to Act to be lacking in how it addresses fundamental changes to tort law in the last twenty-five years...I may not have written 23 law review articles since I graduated, but I did go to school in the state of Minnesota!"
3,Not quite good enough,"I bought this Tonka Fire Truck for my 4-year old grandson who is crazy about fire engines, firefighters and all emergency vehicles. He has a couple of other Tonka trucks and plays with them regularly. He was very pleased to be given the fire engine too, and spends time with it, imagining situations in which it is needed. From my point of view, it is too ""plasticky"". From his point of view, the equipment on it - hoses, lights, alarms etc.- are missing. They are only lightly indicated on the plastic and he wants to be able to use them and move them about. As a toy, I can only rate it as OK - it is disappointing, since with a little more thought applied to the design,it could have been so much better."
5,Get This Truck,I bought this for my son for his Second Christmas. He is in Kindergarten now and still loves it. I am curious to see how many more years he can continue sitting on it before he finally breaks it. I love it and so does my son.
2,"Too big, no activity value","Its a ride on size, but its not a ride-on and is not interactive, my son 2.5 yr old was bored in 2 minutes."
4,"Very Informative, but a little outdated....","I needed this book for a college course in Humanities and found this book to be very informative about various types of media; however, since the book was published in 2000 it would be considered a little outdated based upon the views of media in present time and the type of messages it may be sending out. Most of the information pertained to television, music, entertainment etc. from the early 1900's to up about 1990s. perhaps Ms. Holtzman will include a revised version later on...Made for a very interesting read. The seller was awesome as the book arrived promptly and was in the shape as described."
5,Blessed,"this book was such an inspiration. Helps you to realise that God wants to bless us and fulfil our dreams, but we must walk in his will. Also, our blessings come when we share with and serve others, rather than seek fulfilment for ourselves. It was easy to read, and even though light, caused soul and scripture searching. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to realise the purpose that God ahs for them."
3,Not for the Amature...,"I got this book to learn more about Oriental cloisonne, but found it to be a serious, and ponderous book, even though I have two degrees in Art. Lots of infor, but very technical, so not for amatures for sure. Most illiustrations are B&W, and I prefer color. Also not as much details on the various types as I had hoped, such as Plique a Jour & Champleve, which I wanted to know more about. (I recommend the Chu book if you are just starting out... lots of pix and illistrations in it.)"
4,"Good phones, but may bother those who wear glasses","These headphones sound great, and are lightweight. Since the headband goes behind your nexk, they are good for when you are wearing a hat, or if you are worried about messing up your hair (I have none so that was not an issue with me). They fold up into a flat ""package"" about the size of a baseball. And for such small phones, they have good bass.The problem I had is they have rubber ""tabs"" that ride on top your ears to help hold the phones in place. They did not sit well with the earpieces of my glasses, causing discomfort. I ended up giving them to a friend who raves about them."
5,fabulous sound!,"Best headphones I ever bought. The sound is awesome, deep bass and everything. It's like having two Cambridge Soundworks speakers on your ears, only the headphones are much lighter:) Plus, they don't mess up your hair when you wear them. And yes, those who wear eye glasses will feel a slight discomfort since the frame from the glasses is constantly being pressed into your ears by those anti-slip rubber thingies. But you'll get used to them. And hey, it's either the slight discomfort or your hair getting messed up."
4,Good for the money,"These headphones are awesome. They have great sound quality, are comfortable, and are cheap(no more then twenty bucks at a retail store). The only downside is that they begin to come apart after a while. The parts that come off are the rubber tabs behind the ears and the foam on the earpieces. Even after this they are fully functional(still), but are not nearly as comfortable anymore."
1,"Self-Serving, Manipulative.....","Plot reads like a cheap movie from India - 10 characters across Colorado who all ""just happen"" to be related to each other somehow. Murder, rape, love triangles, bisexual love triangles, child on a respirator, etc. - White hits all the sympathy buttons. All too unbelievable, especially the doctor who gives his life savings to save a patient, and the HMO ""bean counter"" who wants her dead. Uh huh. And the author? Oh, he's a doctor."
4,My favorite thriller author has done it again,"White is persistently a gifted story-teller and good writer, whose books I have read for years. The only reason I have not given a five star rating is that Amazon is rushing me a bit-- I haven't had time to finish this book. I'll comment again at a later date, but what I have read doesn't dsappoint."
2,"Decent book, lousy ending","A rallying cry against managed health care, Critical Conditions examines what one family is willing to do in order to get a toddler the care she needs in order to survive a rare virus. Alan Gregory, a shrink brought in to consult on a case connected to the baby's family, is a fun character, even if he is a bit of a pushover. The writing was good, even if the suspense storylines were on the dull/preposterous side. What took a lot of wind out of the sails of this book was the stultifying ending. Beyond stupid, the last three chapters took this book from interesting to laughable."
2,Thanks to the Reader below for blowing the whole story!,"Before reading a book or while reading a book, I like to check what other people have thought of the book, author, etc. I know that I read here at my own risk, but who would write a review of a murder mystery and GIVE AWAY THE ENDING! Is that the way you normally recommend a book? Here's a great mystery I'm sure you'll love, by the way, the Butler did it! Enjoy! I'm halfway through the book and now have no interest in finishing it. Thanks a bunch"
2,A disappointment,"Although The Fairest Among Women held my attention until the end, I felt disappointed by the book. The book was entirely centred on its main character, Rosa, with all other characters peripheral and little attention paid to the setting of post-war Israel. The book had an unusual style - I wouldn't describe it as magic realism but it was certainly not a believable, realistic story either. I found it hard to accept that the grossly obese Rosa, ""the fattest woman in Israel"", could also be so incredibly beautiful. The author appeared to be trying to make Rosa a character who was extreme in every way, but it just seemed bizarre ... maybe I didn't get the whole concept of the book. I thought the premise of the book was good but I did not enjoy the way it was executed."
4,Another great piece of writing frm shifra horn,Another oustanding novel from Shifra Horn.Like Four Mothers a romantic and sensual novel spanning a vital period in Jerusalem history.It is another really good read with great descriptive passages and lovingly told.There are moments of poignancy and sadness but the humour and fantastic characters carry this story along.I await future books from this author with eagerness.
3,Reader from New York,"I am a fan of Shifra Horn's and enjoyed reading her first novel, ""Four Mothers"", however this second book was a bit difficult to follow at times as she drifted from theme to theme. Still it was an interesting and charming novel."
2,Reasonably disappointed,"I just got this CD today in the mail, rushed it into the CD drive, found out 4 out 5 is just simply...boring. Track 1,2,3 and 5 are pretty much in the same style. Vocal is nice but after hearing the same thing for 4 times, you'll loose interest. The Wippenberg Mix is about the only nice one on the CD."
5,Wonderful aid for any ESL teacher!,I used this program with a student who'd just moved to the US from Brazil - she knew no English. It's most beneficial in a classroom setting and the CD is a great help.
3,Happy to Be Here,"ISBN 0140092315 - To be honest, I'd like to get back the time I spent reading this book. It's not awful, it's not particularly good, but I found little in it that appealed to me and I wouldn't read it again. Keillor seems like the kind of guy it would be fun to have a drink with, but Happy To Be Here? Eh.- AnnaLovesBooks"
3,A debate versus an explanation,"Like many reviews of this book, it is a dialogue between a few children and their teacher. While the teacher challenges the children's statements and questions, such as ""how can anyone be good who doesn't believe in god?"" she sometimes responds with a barrage of questions of her own that could be more helpful broken down and answered individually. Also, she refers to many, many facets of history such as the Dark Ages, Renaissance, Genesis, Greek Mythology etc. in her answers and explanation of Humanism. So it will take a child well versed in social studies, various religions or science to understand her answers to some of questions. Or it will take a child/parent willing to stop and explore these things to grasp the entire concept. I would say this book would be most effective with kids with an open mind, skepticism and a willingness to stand by what feels right for them to believe. Whether it is Humanism or not."
5,Great product at a great price,"Do you realize that this item sell for almost twice at the parts store. Just goes to show you the Mark-up these dizzy birds do. Lucky for us we do comparison shopping and even luckier we have Amazon. I didn't have to drive to the parts store. I didn't have to stand in line. I didn't have to wait until some snot-nosed youth try to figure what I needed and try to look it up on their system. I didn't even have to wait and see if they had it on hand. Even though my own son works at one of these part stores and get a good discount, Amazon still beats them hands down. The product is the exact same one and it worked great........"
5,Wonderful Story,One of the best children books I have ever seen! Teaches love and compassion. Highly recommend!
3,Emotionless Recordings,"The problem I have with the Periah/Haitink Concertos is 1) The recording quality is really bad. The dynamic range is very small, which can singlehandedly make a performance sound dull. Hard to believe it is DDD. 2) I think Murray Periah should stick to Mozart's concertos. His playing is very fluid, and playful, which makes Beethoven's concertos sound less Romantic, and more classical. (no to say that classical is bad, but LvB was trying to break away from the classical era). 3) The linear notes aren't very insightful. You don't learn much about the pieces except what happened when they were first performed."
3,Average text with good CD,"I am a Spanish teacher and am currently using the 5th ed. It is quite average in its treatment and presentation of the Spanish language, but it does come with an excellent CD. The tapes are not suitable for group use in language lab since they must be stopped at various points. Many exercises have little pedagogical value and many are too difficult for the level taught (in my case, community college).The book is suitable for the typical Spanish 101, 102 (first and second semester college) fours-skills-based classes. The amount of vocabulary is not stifling. Grammatical explanations are conventional."
1,A text...this is not,Many universities are now using the Puntos text as a learning tool in their spanish classes. Why? This book is awful. I got more spanish out of my grandmas old spanish text book.
4,Not compatible with Dell 2135cn,"I have a dell 2135cn which I like, but has memory issues - bought this to solve the problem (didn't want to shell out $70-80 for the Dell branded memory). Unfortunately, this module is not compatible, so I'm back to the drawing board. Odd, though, since on paper it should be compatible and it's the correct size/format."
5,Great memory for an HP CP2025DN,"Flawless memory. powered off my printer. Then to make sure I hit the power button to make sure no residual power could cause me a problem. Afterwards, I just inserted the memory and properly seated the memory in it's socket. After powering up a test of the system showed I had the extra memory. I may never need the extra memory. But it's their if I need it. And the price was to good to pass up. inexpensive and Kingston is a great brand memory. Plus fast delivery."
5,No Brainer,"Hello, this chip was for an HP multi-function printer. You really need the extra memory so that print jobs leave your pc and are accepted by the printer memory. Otherwise, big jobs (usually with lots of graphics in color) can hold up your processor while the printer formats each page with the memory it has.HP charges $599 for the 256 Mb chip while Kingston (thru Amazon) sells it for about $11.00. This is like the hospital charging $5.00 for an aspirin -- because they can. My machine runs fine. By the way, the HP printer only costs about $650. In the last 25 years I have never purchased extra printer memory from HP - always from a third party and have never had a problem. Hp might tell you that their warranty is no valid with external parts, but that is bogus...dm"
5,Memory Power,Great value. Fast shipment. Easy to install and works great !!Don't need more works to describe this product. Memory Power Plus
5,Good memory,Looked around for HP laser printer memory. Most of it was very expensive. This was the correct memory at a great price.
4,Great price and grood product,Installed the memory module in my Brother MFC-9970CDW multi-function laser printer. Ptinter saw additional memory and it works great. Can't believe the low price $10.99 and with shipping!
1,printer unable to detect the memory,printer unable to detect the memory....very disappointing. it was a total was of time as i have remove and reinstall the memory according to the instruction provided.
3,Sexy and cool as expected but no soaring heights,"Ethan Hawke's novel is sexy, dry and cool, as two likeable characters road trip through America, the inner workings of their relationship and self-knowedge. It is a little too trying to be Catcher in the R for me at times, and although both characters are reasonably strong and real, it eventuated for me as merely an insight into the developing self-understanding (with sometimes-inspired philosophical revelations attached) of two young people and how they relate to each other, and not much else. I need my novels to soar higher than that, Hawke. Three stars."
5,thunder-ous road trip,"- like Springsteen's 'Thunder Road', Ethan Hawke's 'Ash Wednesday' is desperate, last chance, hopeful, beautiful. The prose is so strong, this book practically has a heart-beat. Screw the naysayers, he IS a writer and a wonderful one at that."
1,Utter Waste of Time!,"I was extremely disappointed with this novel. After reading Hawke's, The Hottest State, and loving it...I was expecting to have a similar experience with Ash Wednesday. Boy, was I ever wrong! I didn't even want to finish the drawn out book that seemed like 200+ pages made up entirely of pointless dialogue. I found myself skimming the exaggerated, neverending chapters. Please, don't waste your time on this one."
3,Not quite as good as Ethan's first novel,"Didn't enjoy this as much as Ethan Hawke's first novel, The Hottest State, as this one felt a bit indulgent in places...but it's still pretty good."
3,"You've got to deliver the goods if yer gonna write a ""road"" novel","This novel is what would happen if a jazz-less, dyslexic Jack Kerouac collided head on with an adolescent version of Tom Wolfe. Hawke's prose hustles along in a cute, jingly-jangley sort of way stuck somewhere between immature versions of the above mentioned authors. This novel isn't bad, but it isn't good either. We see genuine flashes of exceptional writing, but a lack of consistency. The story is occasionally graceful, but the characters often present themselves as clichés. Hawke manages to tell his story but at no point does a definitive, individualized style present itself. Ethan never puts his stamp on this one and we're reminded that good writing simply has to move beyond what we've read and experienced before."
3,Jimmy & Christy's Story,"Jimmy and Christy are in their early twenties. They love each other, but are unable to allow themselves to be loved. She's pregnant and running home to Texas to try to deal with her confused life. Jimmy goes AWOL and their trip to Ohio and Texas begins. They've got a lot of junk to deal with from their childhood and the soul searching begins. At times I loved the two main characters and other times I hated them. Sometimes the story seems like a love story and other times it's a pitty party. The story kept my interest, not as a classic novel, but just as a simple tale of two kids trying to grow up."
1,Please take this moron's pen away,"Acting is a worthy profession. It takes skill, talent and, motivation. However, it's not that hard, it isn't something that compares to air traffic controlling, emergency surgery, or writing. So why is it that actors think they can do all sorts of things? They tell us who to vote for, who to give our charity money to, or in this instance, write novels? This is the biggest waste of ink and paper since ""Chicken Soup for the Soul."" This is a self-indulgent farce. Just because he can stand on a desk, doesn't mean his cliche stupidities should be immortalized. I'd like to think that the publishing industry wouldn't infilict such tripe on us if it wasn't for his celebrity. If you are thinking of purchasing this book, please consider something else, perhaps a punch in the mouth (believe me, it would hurt less). This book, and Mr. Hawke, are a joke."
1,a disappointment,"This story does not say a lot and what it does say is not said well. The plot is derivative. The characters are hollow and unlikable. The male character's narcissistic self-reflections grate unmercifully. The female in particular is reduced to a hollow caricature. The tone strikes me as somehow false in that the story's ""honesty"" seems a pose. A good actor does not a good writer make. Forego this book and read the classics. F. Scott Fitzgerald's ""Tender is the Night"" and ""The Beautiful and the Damned"" are good places to start. Sprinkle in Hemingway's short stories. Throw in D.H. Lawrence; he wrote obsessively about male/female interactions and did so with great insight and honesty. Add Sam Shepard's plays to your list. These are the real McCoys. Sadly, it seems that Hawke's publisher wants to cash in on his celebrity status, because if this book were written by a non-famous type it would have been promptly rejected."
2,I made it through the entire book,"This is not an easy task with Hawke's book b/c the characters are narcissistic and stifling. The writing is not revelatory, but there is a heart to the book and that is offered quite sincerely. Neither character is one you'd necessarily like to sit down with for dinner (well maybe Christy, b/c she is depicted as being very sexually-attractive and her mood changes are interesting).But this is a book I felt like putting down a couple of times b/c it doesn't have a real strong narrative drive, but I stayed with it, found the male character endearing and honest, and ended up enjoying it pretty much."
3,The multi-talented Ethan Hawke,"Well, I will be honest: I wasn't expecting to be impressed by this book, and it did exceed my expectations. Although, I have to say that Jimmy and Christy were difficult to like, especially with Jimmy telling her things like ""I am going to have affairs"" and her just accepting that with a smile on her face. I'm no feminist-but come on!! Any woman who can listen to a man tell her that and accept it, well, that is hard for me to swallow. Other than that, I think you have to give Ethan Hawke some credit. Not only is he a good actor but he seems to be a halfway decent author as well. This isn't a great book, but it's ok, and it is hard to put down once you get started."
4,Good to read from a good actor!,"The relation of a woman and a man during the premarital status and afterwards: it could have not been told in a better way. The conversation type of writing makes the story exciting. In some chapters, I couldn't just stop reading. The story contains peak points, and clues about ""American way of life"" but I was quite disappointed in Ethan Hawke's lack of knowledge about Istanbul."
1,Not Again,"If the myth about 100 monkeys at 100 typewriters is true - then Ethan Hawke is monkey #1.Ethan Hawke types, he does not write (thank you Truman Capote). Once again, the idea of shaping language to be meaningful and unique is abandoned. This book is not a contribution to literature, it is a expression of vanity, ego and Hollywood name value."
1,If the author's name was George McMarty,"Seriously. If this book was by some unknown author, he/she wouldn't even be able to get an agent. He'd be laughed at by small publishers. Look, Ethan, no one is good at Everything. Let it go. Act. Put down the pen. Or, at least, if you pick it up, keep it to yourself."
3,A story of disorder and early sorrow.,"The story, Ash Wednesday, written by Ethan Hawke, revolves around two young adults, Jimmy and Christy, who are very much in love with eachother, but not able to love themselves. Over the journey to marriage, Jimmy and Christy learn many things about eachother and their own lives that they never knew. I really liked this book because it dealt with many real life situations. It shows growth between a couple and not just the good sides. This book awakens people to the reality of a marriage and pregnancy at a young age. It also brings in to play the risk of losing something so precious to you. I could relate to this book in more ways than one because I, myself have experienced terrible loses more than once. Although having read another book of Ethan Hawke's, The Hottest State, I'd have to say I did not enjoy this book as much. I am looking forward to more books from this author and I hope that he only grows as a writer."
3,okay yet missing something,"When I picked up this book, I wasn't expecting much, so I wasn't too disappointed. It is an interesting story of a couple at a crossroads. Both with their relationship and themselves. While Hawke's descriptions and narrative style are good, there seemed to be some emotional element that was lacking. One never really gets to care about the characters,and when the book ends there is no feeling of closure. The reader simply closes the book, never thinking about Christy or Jimmy again."
3,Another good Asterix adventure.,"Albert Uderzo, Asterix and the Black Gold (Dargaud, 1981)Ekonomikrisis the merchant has landed at the indomitable Gaulish village, but he's fresh out of rock oil, which Getafix needs to make his magic potion. Asterix and Obelix to another globe-trotting rescue! This time the pair are headed for Mesopotamia, along with the help of Roman-Agent-disguised-as-a-druid Dubbelosix (who bears a remarkable resemblance to a young Sean Connery. These artists are crazy!). There's a great deal of Biblical messing-about, some James Bond punnery, and a good time is had by all (save, of course, the Romans). ***"
3,Useful,"Yes, very useful, but not a must have. Most of the tips are things that by the time you get around to writing a thesis, you should already know. The best feature is the one that contains tips on gathering information. One designed with an APA focus would be to die for :)"
4,Very handy for tablet PC's,"I'm an engineering student, so naturally I take lots of notes. I use this keyboard with an IBM x41 ultraportable Tablet PC. When I have the screen turned for tablet use, of course you don't have use of the laptops keyboard. I got this so I could lay the tablet flat on a desk, so I can type and write on my tablet. This keyboard really makes an excellent setup for note taking.Pros: Good design overall, not too expensive, very portable and lightweight without feeling cheap, keys are full sized except for arrow keys, overall very good.Cons: The spacebar is ""cut in half"" to allow folding of the keyboard (it is sometimes annoying when typing fast), also the arrow buttons are kinda cheap and not very useful, they don't have a good feel and are hard to press compared to all the other keys. Also, the removable usb cord uses some kind of proprietary connector, so if you loose yours or is damaged it might be difficult to replace (it's smaller than mini usb)"
4,"Not full, but usable","I got this keyboard to go with my Entourage Edge dualbook. It's small enough to fit in the pocket of the device's carrying sleeve, and is definitely sturdier than the Handspring Visor keyboard on which one of the other folding keyboards I've seen is based. The numeric keys, as others have mentioned, are small, and that's a minor inconvenience. The arrow ""keys"" are actually a circular directional-pad, which isn't great for document editing but might be useful for turning the keyboard sideways and using it as a gamepad. The split spacebar and slight offsets of the keys near the hinge aren't really an issue for me, but the offsets may upset a pure touch-typist. Probably the most routinely frustrating aspect of the keyboard for me is that shift-, and shift-. deliver ; and ' at least on Android 1.6, leaving < and > completely inaccessible. Kinda lousy on a mobile device once you start realizing how much you <3 those symbols in emotes >_<;"
1,Plug broke on cord,"I've had my keyboard six months. It's a bit big and bulky, and doesn't lock open, so it's a little hard to use it in your lap. But other than that I liked it until today, when the little keyboard-end of the plug on my cord broke. So far I haven't been able to find a replacement. If what the other reviewer says is true, they don't make them."
4,So far so good!!!,"I am currently 33 weeks pregnant and so far (fingers crossed) no stretch marks! I bought this product because of all of the great reviews. I have been through 3 or 4 jars so far with 6 weeks left to go (I got my first one at probably 12-14 weeks) and am about to need to order another one, so they don't last too long (or maybe I apply too liberally)...BUT if I do make it through my pregnancy without stretch marks then it is well worth the money to me! Too soon to tell for sure, but great product so far."
2,Still got stretch marks,"I used this regularly from week 20-41 and I have tons of stretch marks. They didn't appear until my last month, but alas they appeared. They're not bright red so I feel lucky about that. This cream also smells nice, but for $35 I can buy some super yummy stuff at Bath and Body Works."
5,This stuff works!,I used this stuff religiously during my first pregnancy and it worked. Not a stretch mark in sight!
4,Smells great!,"I bought a few of these while I was pregnant. I loved the texture and the scent of this belly cream. The jury is still out on whether it works or not. I didn't have too bad of stretch marks, but I did have some. They're not really visible anymore because they have faded over time. It's worth a shot, it's nicely packaged and I enjoyed using it. Though I'm a bit skeptical that there is really ANY stretch mark cream that is guaranteed to work. I think mostly stretch marks are due to genetics, and how much weight you gain (too much, too fast). I'd consider using again for baby number two."
1,I got huge Strech marks! It is a LIE!,"Okay .... I know this product has a good rating and it seems to be working for some pp but not for me!I've start using it since I was 8 weeks pregnant and I applied it everyday and I was fine till my 28th weeks of pregnancy came in when Boom I got plenty of stretch marks around my lower belly and even on my sides :(I gained 1Lb per week during my pregnancy, and my doctor said I am a fine and healthy pregnant women and no creams will help a women if you have the gene and hormone to produce the damn stretch mark!Anyhow, I bought 3 jars of this Mama Mio and feel like a silly girl who waste my money and who knows what is really inside this cream!So bottom line, do not buy it ... if you really wanna care for yourself just apply olive oil/almond oil.Good Luck & do nt be foooooool."
3,Lasts Less Than a Month!,"I was pretty happy with the smell and texture of the product itself, however, for the money, I was extremely disappointed that it was gone within 3 weeks! I only used it once a day and occassionally a second time at night. Way too expensive for how long it lasts."
3,Doesn't go a long way...,"Hi, this product is good, however, it doesn't really go a long way. The lotion is very thick. Using this product combined with the Mama Mio Tummy Rub Stretch Mark Oil is much better! Next time I order, I just plan to buy just the oil instead, as it goes a long way. 6 months pregnant and still no stretch marks. Been using this product for over a month."
3,I had better expectations on this product,"After reading all the reviews, I thought this could be the miracle cream. I think it does an OK job, but it doesn't penetrate to help the skin get rid of the post pregnancy marks. I think is very expensive and doesn't work that well."
2,My butter seems old,"When I got this in the mail I was so excited. From what I heard from reviews on YouTube the scent is supposed to be really good, but when I took a whiff of this cream/butter it did not please me at all. Actually make me kind of nautious. That just might be my hormones though. The consistency is not creamy at all. I'm not sure if it's just the tub I recieved, but maybe I got an old one. Hmm, not sure if it prevent strechmarks either. I'm only 2 months in and it might be too soon to tell. The smell just prevents me from even wanting to use this."
2,Stretch marks are GENETIC!,"Ladies, there is no miracle cream -- if your mother had stretch marks, you'll probably get them too! That being said, if you want a nice-smelling belly cream that has NO greasy after-feel, or if you just want something to moisturize your belly so it's not so itchy, this is a nice product. It's pretty expensive though, considering the tub doesn't last long at all. I'd rather spend $3 on Palmer's cocoa butter lotion and put up with the greasiness, because it moisturizes just as well at a fraction of the cost."
2,Lady in Blue,"The butter goes on really smooth, soaks in pretty quickly, and does not upset my supersensitive very dry skin (no small feat in my world). I have had this for a few months and only used it about 4 times. I love the feel but the smell makes me nauseous. My husband thinks it smells good but my pregnant ""supernose"" cannot handle it. I even waited until my 2nd trimester to see if it would grow on me but no luck."
1,Waste of money!!!,"I used this product as directed, once in the morning and at night. It did not work at all. I still got marks and am very unhappy that I wasted $35 on this cream. I would not recommend buying this product."
1,Waste of Money,"This was definitely a waste of money. Everyone told me I was probably going to get stretch marks as my mother did, but I was convinced if I found a good cream I wouldnt. I used this for two months and used up almost the whole bottle, and I have the most horrible looking deep red/purple stretch marks. This did not work one bit, maybe it moisturized my skin a bit. The interesting thing is I dont have any marks on my stomach - just thighs, butt, and boobs - i think this goes to show that if your prone to get them, you will. To all those lucky ppl out there who didnt get any after using this cream, I bet they wouldnt of gotten any even if they havent used it. Save your money! With a baby on the way there are many more uses for it!"
1,Not worth the money,I heard so much about this product that I bought it. It didn't seem to be anything special and I went back to using my Palmer's coco butter which is much more reasonably priced. So I advise all you future Mom's to save the $.
5,A MUST!,"I know everyone thinks that it's in your genes to get stretch marks and there's no way to avoid them. I was given this as a gift from my MIL when I was about 13 weeks pregnant, and started using it with little faith because I got stretch marks from growing in puberty on my upper thighs and hips. They are so so faded now, but there you go - I get stretch marks.Anyway, I used this religiously once a day for the entirety of my pregnancy. I had a belly, for sure...but not ONE SINGLE STRETCH MARK. I think I needed to buy two more containers to get through the remainder of my pregnancy, but I feel it was worth it considering I'm not going to be searching for cosmetic procedures to be removing stretch marks!I highly, highly recommend this stuff - and it smells really nice!"
2,Overwhelming scent,"While the cream might have been effective , I haven't been able to use it due to its strong scent . Pregnancy strengthens your sense of smell, having produced this product for pregnant women , one would assume they would take that into consideration but "" NO"" they haven't . I tried using it twice , both times the smell made me nauseous and I couldn't stand myself . I wouldn't recommend it to any pregnant woman who has a heightened sense of smell . It was a waste of money for me unfortunately!"
1,"HONESTLY, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!","THIS PRODUCT IS A WASTE OF MONEY...I usually don't leave reviews but i really disliked this product and want to save people their time and money. This product was nothing special just a thick lotion that clumped when i tried to rub it in. And as far as being itch relieving to a growing belly, it helps for a few minutes only and then your itching again :(I ended up buying Bella B Tummy Honey Butter, and no stretch marks! I HIGHLY recommend it instead... works great and is at a reasonable price unlike Mama Mio tummy rub.good luck with the choice u make!"
4,I love it but the smell...,I ordered this after reading many reviews. For some reason I never paid much attention to any that remarked about the scent. When you first put it on it smells like citrus peels (orange mixed with lemon) or lemon starburst. After its had a while to soak in to my skin I feel like I have a teenage boy following me around. Smells very musky and makes me want to remove it. If I was still had morning sickness I do not think I could use it. I do like how it absorbs fast in to my skin and makes it feel really soft. The butter is very thick and a little goes a long way but it doesn't seem to clog my pores. I use the stretch mark oil with this at the same time. I hope I can get use to the smell because I do love how it makes my skin feel.
2,Bait and switch,"Ordered the tub, got the tube. Definitely less in the tube for the same high price.Otherwise it's good stuff"
2,I got stretch marks,I used this every morning and night throughout my whole pregnancy. I noticed stretch marks appear around 36 weeks and they kept getting worse. Smells nice but useless at preventing stretch marks.
1,If only the.........were given,"They ""LOOK"" nice but nothing is said regarding which sizesare provided NOR where they are made. Fuller ""was"" one of thefew that insisted their products were Made in the U.S.A."
4,Decent for the price,"This is a good selection of chisels to put in the toolbox, useful in many situations. It is not a complete set for a woodworker, but I find it useful to take to have on hand when I go to a work site, particularly when I was not expecting to need a chisel."
1,Not exactly what I was expecting,Not exactly what I was expecting. The glass in my lamp seems to come out a great deal further than the one in the picture. The lamp looks a lot cheaper than I thought it would. I would have returned it but the box got thrown out by accident. I will keep it and hope it grows on me. The only good quality is that it has a low and high light feature.
2,Disappointed,"To look at them far away, they are very pretty. But, for the price, they are very cheaply made. The shades are just plastic and look like they will break at any time. The cheap gold plating looks very tacky. Sorry."
4,Shade ready,This is a great invention and easy to install. I wish it came in more colors but overall it was easy to cut to my window size and looks good. I would suggest it as a cheap way to go on half circle windows.
4,Great Product for Quick Fix,Shade was easy to cut and install. The plastic holder helps hold this in place with double sided tape. I'd buy again if I needed to.
1,"very poor quality, cheap, difficult to install","This is the second time we've attempted to place a blind like this, we are very disappointed in the quality. The shade is very difficult to trim and assemble in the holder. The paper crimps in the middle and you cannot smooth the pleats out. This shade 'fell' after being up only a week. We'll not replace it with another."
5,Great value,"For the reviewer who said ""Don't waste your money"", I say ""you get what you pay for"".We bought these to block sun on the round windows that are above the rectangular bottom parts. We have wooden blinds below but the tops are open and the sun is a killer. We priced plantation shutters and other products but the prices were prohibitive. When we ordered these, for as cheap as they were, we didn't expect much. We were pleasantly surprised.A slight modification was needed. These fan shades are made to attach to a bottom sill of a round window. Our application was to put them above blinds that cover the bottom of the window. Since the blinds have an open topped box at top, it was necessary to cut a piece of 1/4"" paneling to cover the top of that box. Then installation was easy.They look great from the street. We put them up this winter so we will just have to wait and see how well they hold up to the South Texas summer sun."
2,Frustrating! Falls down all the time.,"I'm having the same problem as other reviewers (YES, i used the holder). The doublesided tape on this item isn't strong enough to hold the item in place. But, I've also tried a lot of different double sided things to get it to stay in place...no luck. Would actually be fairly nice for a temporary solution to the hot sun heating up my house if it didn't fall down every day. Also, the more you have to handle it, the more the paper gets out of shape so it's a vicious circle. Giving two stars because when it's in place, it looks relatively decent and does the job of reducing the hot sunlight."
4,it was easy to fit,I liked it because of the price and it was easy to fit into my window. Just cut to the right size.
5,Performs perfectly,"Don't let other comments fool you, this is a great item. Some people mention problems with either the measuring or the stickiness of the product, but I haven't had an issue with either and here's why:* Yes, the measuring tape on the product itself is off by an inch or more, but this is intentional to accommodate the little arch at the bottom-center of the fan as it goes over the plastic holder. Use the measurements on the fan - they're trustworthy.* Clean the surface of the area you want to apply the fan to THOROUGHLY. Adhesive that is applied to dust won't hold well and will come loose. I scrubbed the ledge where I wanted to mount my fan with warm, soapy water. The original binding is still holding, even after 7 months.Keep these two things in mind and you should be satisfied by what you get for what you spent."
3,looks pretty cheap,"but you get what you pay for. it does the job but i never used it, it's in my closet"
2,Redi Shade Arch Shade,"I returned the two shades because they were not the quality I expected. Even though I returned the two shades in the same single box they were sent to me in, Amazon deducted almost twice the initial shipping cost from my refund by charging me for shipping on two separate items as though I returned the items in two separate boxes, which I did not. The initial free budget shipping charge of $5.70 was waived. However, a $10.68 returned shipping charge was deducted from my $31.98 purchase. I could not find the way on Amazon's website to contest the double deduction of the shipping charges from my refund."
3,ONLY if you have a PERFECT arch!,"Do not follow the instructions if you do not have a perfect arch! I made this mistake and now have a shade that does not extend all the way to the edges of the window. I think you can trim it to a more oval arch, although it will be a bit more difficult, not impossible. When you measure, measure the width of the arch first, not the height. Then trim."
2,worthless,"this was not what i expected at all. It was paper thin and it tore easily. There was no way to secure the top in place so it wouldnt tip over. Also, was not the right shape for our window."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TO BLOCK LIGHT!,"This does absolutely nothing to block light. I purchased this because my fiance works nights and sleeps during the day, but please, don't waste your money. We'll be looking for something else."
4,"Easy to Install, But...","The shade was easy to cut and fit to the window, but the lack of structure along the bottom (straight) edges lets it start deforming if not completely supported by something flat."
1,Don't Use In Bathrooms,"Don't bother trying to use in a bathroom that you happen to take showers in. Mine literally melted out of the window during the first shower after set up. I was hoping that it would be a temporary fix, I just didn't realize how temporary it would be."
1,Didnt block out light,We were looking for something to block out light in our arch window since we both work grave yards and this did not work. It was almost like there was no shade on the window. Would not recommend for a window facing direct sunlight.
3,It's a boat horn,Looks good installed. Haven't hooked up the console to power yet since I'm still rebuilding the boat. Just wish they had supplied a cutout template. Overall not bad.
3,Nice but large,"It's a nice cover with plenty of space for cards/notes and other small items, but it's too big to fit into your shirt pocket. There is also no way to attach it to anything so you're stuck carrying it around everywhere. It would be better if there was a belt clip or some similar method of attaching it to youself."
5,Montana Man is a Five Star Man!,"Montana Territory, 1884Wow! This great story is filled with strong dramatic emotions that will invoke your sympathies and you'll applaud the determined human spirit! Montana man is fast paced and never dull. It will definitely keep your interest from the first page to the last!This is truly a tale of love found during the worse of circumstances and how love conquers all."
2,Montana Man,"At first, I really enjoyed the book, but it upset me when Trey took Miranda into his bed. It just disappointed me. If that was not bad enough, the author continually put the two into bed describing each lust filled encounter a bit too much. I tried to skip over these parts, but they were still there. It just ruined the book for me, and I didn't even finish it. I had bought severl of Jillian's books, and Montana Man is the third I've read. The first two were fine, but this is not my idea of a good book. I'm hoping the other Jillian Hart books I've bought aren't so sexually explicit."
2,Characters who stayed characters,"Having recently read a newspaper review, I looked forward to reading Husband and Wife. The premise of a crumbling marriage and disatisfaction with life was dealt with in a very unreal way. The characters never came alive for me. I toiled through each chapter, hoping that the potentially interesting story line would develop. It never did for me."
4,A CONTEMPORIZATION OF THIS WORK,"In this book we find a collection of verses from a longer poem of the same name first published in 1855.Opening with ""For men may come and men may go, But I go on forever.....,"" these lines are a well-loved ode to nature.Now, Micucci contemporizes this work with illustrations of people and animals who live by the stream."
3,Fresh Feeling,"I have mixed reviews about the Homedics PowerDent toothbrush. I have been using it for 6 months now and know my teeth have never been or felt better. Given that it is much more afordable that most similar products, it really does a great job. It has a strong power to it and the rechargeable base unit works great. The only downfall are the toothbrushes. Of the three that come with the unit, one broke the first time I used it. The second one worked fine and lasted 3 months. The third one doesn't always spin properly when brushing. I have to hold it away from my teeth to get it back on track. Also, because the base is not interchangeable with other brands, it is very hard to find stores that carry the replacement brushes for this set."
4,no problems at all,"I've had this toothbrush for over a year, no problems with it's operations, toothbrush heads or anything else. It does a great job. I only wish I could easily get replacement heads."
2,Homedics Toothbrush Heads,"I like the toothbrush, and the way it works. Now, if they can just make the heads so they don't fall apart after a couple of weeks."
1,Cheap,"First of all, the case DOES NOT FIT VERIZON MODELS of this phone. Secondly, it is so cheap feeling and looking. On the sides, the silicone does not even have a smooth seam its jagged and rough. I would not recommend this product to anyone, especially not someone with the verizon model which I have discovered is the L7c so its my fault the case does not fit. The company does make other good products so don't be afraid."
2,Alright,The price is the only reason to purchase this case. Any more and this case is not worth it. Easily rips and holes are cut too small. It protects the phone and that is my only concern.
1,Not what you want,"Unlike other skins reviewed here, this one fits well. Unfortunately it is nearly impossible to use the phone with the cover on. The case completely hides all the numbers and symbols on the phone. Maybe if there was a picture on the site before I bought it I would have clued into this fact."
2,A sanitized snoozer,"What a chore it was to finish this book! It's been sanitized to the point of lethargy. Mick Wall gives the appearance of doing his best, but ultimately, being an ""official"" biography, he has to kowtow to the Steve Harris Show, which is what Iron Maiden is revealed to be. Not a speck of dirt, and way more than I ever wanted to hear about British football. For hardcore fans only."
4,An interesting read,"A must have for Maiden fans, Wall does a good job analyzing the bands ventures over the years. From the dirty pubs of London's East End to the gigantic arenas in the US, Wall covers ever detail in informative fashion.The most common complaint about this book is that Wall spends too much time focusing on the band's ""rough-n-tumble"" East End beginnings and not enough time with the glory years of the mid-late 80's. It would have been nice if Wall gave equal coverage to every album, instead of creating mammoth sections for some (such as Number of the Beast) and skimping over others (i.e., the short piece on Somewhere In Time)"
4,Everything Except the Music,"Truly an inspirational look inside not only the beginnings of a world-class rock band, but of the foundations of the NWOBHM ""movement."" But despite the author's prefaced defense, the musical side of the Maiden story is noticibly missing: i.e, a closer look at each members' musicianship and development, not to mention what the author calls ""who played what instrument on what song."" Iron Maiden's music is complex and important enough to warrant such a review. Regardless, a must-read for any heavy metal and/or Iron Maiden fan. UP THE IRONS!"
3,Great book,"THis book is fantastic. It's one of the best rock biographies ever written. And, listen carefully: it's not a picture biography: it's really a book!!What almost ruined the whole hard work by Mick Wall, in my humble opinion, is that he had not the courage to tell, at the end of the book, how bad Maiden was going with Blaze on vocals. He finished the book talking about how strong and optmistic they were with their new singer, how the new album (VIRTUAL XI) was so fantastic, etc, etc. But the final answer we alll know... Blaze fired and Bruce brought back.Other than this, it's a pleasure to read it."
2,"Buy a gameboy, the price is better.","This is a good product - but why not wait until it isreasonably and realisticly priced?You can buy a gameboy color for [less] and there are about 1000 games for it. This is nothing more than a piece of plastic.If you choose to spend the money then yes it does make games a little better, not all that though."
2,OUT-DATED;.......YET SORELY NEEDED!!!!,"I KNOW THIS BOOK WAS VERY INEXSPENSIVE; HOWEVER,....KEEP IN MIND, IT WAS WRITTEN IN 1977!!!! MY COVER WAS ACTUALLY ""SUN-BLEACHED"" AND PAGES SEEN BETTER DAYS.......HOWEVER; DID NOT YET READ ENTIRE BOOK. HOWEVER;JUST THE FACT THAT THERE IS A BOOK DEVOTED TO ""ONE'S OWN PRIVACY""....IS WORTHY OF PRAISE!!! CHECK OUT THE PUBLISHERS ACTUAL WEB-SITE DEDICATED TO BOOKS OF ""PRIVACY""..............AND MUCH MUCH MORE!!!--[...]---"
2,very poor,I was very disappointed in the workmanship of this product. The colors do not match. This hat is not worth the money.
4,a pretty good toy,this toy is farily good. but the thing is that the super mode legs do not stay toghther that good. mine dont anyways. the auto transformation feture does make it funner but it wont auto transform on carper. BYE THE WAY DOES ANY BODY NO A GOOD SITE TO GET SCREEN SHOTS OF DRAGONBALL Z ULTIMATE BATTLE 22
5,Armada Optimus Prime,This is a AWSOME toy!!! It is one of the best toys I have.The robot mode is AWSOME!!! The base and trailer mode is AWSOME!!! The robot mode is ok. the reason I say this is because you can not move his legs and his legs will not stay on the sides good.Above all I think this is a great toy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,okay toy,i just found out this new super con is coming out in november which can attach to optimus. i rated this toy three stars for durrabelety because he can't its knees. Also if your not careful his arms while snap. i rated the toy a four star because unless you are going to pre-order Jetfire w/ mini-con it will be dull and boring to play with. I rated the toy 3 stars for educational because other than moving the piece you aren't learning anything. So rember it won't be as fun with out the super-con
4,Great toy,"This toy I purchased for my cousin's birthday, and he was really amazaed, he loves it a lot... it has a normal size and it's pretty durable, and it's still there."
1,Piece of Junk,"This toy is horrible! My son begged for this for Christmas andafter hours of struggling to get it to transform (it never did transform) we decided to take it back and get another one.The directions leave alot to be desired but they were understandable after spending so many hours trying to get it to transform.We got the second one home and was thrilled to see that it transformed perfectly. The problems is, after the third timetransforming it, it will now only transform into super robot mode. It will not go into the base-station mode at all. And to make it go back into the trailer mode we have to shut it off with the switch and turn it back on. This is the only way it will work.Needless to say, this one is going back tomorrow morning too. This is not a very goood toy for the money!!It caused alot of tears and aggravation on Christmas morningand now again 3 days later. I would not recommend this toyfor any child! Your money will be better spent on anything but this."
4,"Awesome Prime, add it to your collection today!",This toy rocks! Optimus Prime is very meched out and tech looking in this incarnation. The auto-transform feature is mesmerising and fun. The base mode allows for awesome Mini-Con play.
3,What the h*** is this?,"Educational value? In a Transformer? What in god's name is anyone going to learn from a Transformer? Anyway, onto the review. And the obvious... the main appeal of this thing is the name... it's Optimus Prime. That alone helped it get over on the fans. Secondly, the familiar red/blue color scheme is once again put to good use. And... that's about it...The ""super mode?"" I don't know what it's called.. I only know what I call it... ugly. Never since Machine Wars has there been a more pathetic excuse for an Optimus Prime. And I'm no stranger to non articulating figures, but the legs on this thing are just pathetic. A fold out trailer complete with bells and whistles... Ohhh, how the mighty have fallen. Luckily the basic mode looks great when not attatched to the trailer... and maybe it should stay that way."
1,this toy is a major disappointment!!,"I have two boys. A 7yr old and 5 yr old.. They both wanted optimus for Christmas this year so we bought two of them. We are totally disappointed and if they hadn't destroyed the boxes in the process of opening their gifts, I would have returned both of them.. My husband and I have spent a lot of time trying to help the boys get the parts to stay on.. many of the pieces wont stay on, like the grill on the front of the truck.. the upper half of the body wont stay attached to the lower half when its transformed into a robot. I could go on and on-- Also, the instructions are very unclear. My kids were so frustrated Christmas morning my 5 yr old was brought to tears.. Dont waste your money!!"
2,"Complex, fragile, and poorly made","I bought this for my 5 year old's birthday, and it's pretty much been a waste. After a few hours rassling the thing out of the package and trying to figure out the transformation instructions (think IKEA furniture, but harder), I've concluded that the thing just isn't made that well. Stuff that should snap together doesn't stay snapped, and the electronics, other than the blinking light in the arm, remain a mystery. The truck unit is supposed to fold automatically and appropriately in response to the state of the cab unit, but mostly it just lurches into half-positions at times that I still can't figure out. I can see the trigger button that must start the electronics, but pushing it doesn't do anything.It's kind of cool looking, but it doesn't even have stiff enough joints to use as a doll - you put it into a standing or fighting position and it just sighs over and collapses. Wimp."
2,A great disapointment!,"Optimus is back for the new Armada toy line.The toy is made so that you press on his truck to transform it into a mini-con base and the legs for his super mode.When I first saw the toy I was excited by it. However, once I started to play with it I realized how bad it was.You have to repeatedtly press the truck to make it transform, and even when you do get it transformed it gets stuck half way sometimes, and there is no way to transform the cab manually. Also this toy lacks poseability. You can hardly move its arms around, and you can't move the legs AT all.The mini-con that comes with this is great.For [the price] I would not get this toy. If you ever find it for...less I would of recommended this toy.I would not get this toy unless you are transformers hardcore completist, otherwise skip this toy and get the deluxe version of him. Final Grade C"
3,The automatic transform doesn't work,"My son begged for this for a long time before we actually found it in the store. He was so excited, especially when he found out the trailer transformed by itself. Imagine the disappointment when it didn't work. He was so upset to have to return it because it was so hard to find to begin with. We returned it and got a second one, which doesn't work either. We are not returing this one, because my son says he can just transform it himself. This is fine, except for the price. [The price] for something that doesn't work is very expensive."
2,Would be great without the auto transform feature,This would be a very good toy if it did not have the auto transform feature. My son was really sad that we needed to return two of them because they just did not work. We will not be getting a third one. If they had just skipped the cheezy auto transform junk he would have been very happy and so would I. Don't buy it if you expect it to work. If you just want a collection piece then go ahead.-B
2,Disappointed,Not anywhere near as nice as RID Optimus. I wish Hasbro would use some diecast like they did in the eighties. For the money you pay this toy is made with very cheap parts. Looks OK in truck mode. The original eighties Optimus is much nicer. I am 29 and had many of the originals when I was a kid. It would be nice for them to stick with making them look like real modern day vehicles and objects like the originals and the RID line. Hope this is not a foreshadow of the toys to come.
3,supa groovy dance music-3 3/4 starz!,I saw these guys at the first Ultra in 1999. This is before Ultra fest went corporate with lame-arsed dance acts. Best track here is the remixed Dynamix ii track
2,Disappointment,"I absolutely loved these shoes, but the slingback frayed just like the other reviewer said after only a few times wearing the shoes. I never buy leather but I caved for this because it was the only flat pointed toe shoe that I could find for work. I'm going to see if I can get the company to repair or replace them though because it seems a little ridiculous."
2,Didn't last long,The sling back cut into my heel and the strap frayed and snapped within 5 times of wearing them. Not recommended!
2,A book of lists,"This book is useful if you are interested in the world of political intrique. The book is not a good starting point for reading about corruption in politics. It is merely an extensive listing of members of these societies. Before you peruse these lists find out what they are about.Bill Clinton is there (no wonder he was never forced out of office). George Bush (senior)is there, take a look and see who,among the contenders for 2000 are on the list. Its hard to find people who are not and that is scarey."
4,Too Short But Sweet,The book is mostly list. The information around the list is to the point. Clear. I will probably buy other copies for a few friends.
2,Textbook for college Class,This was required reading for a class at my university. It was okay and I really did not care for it much. A little on the dull side but informative.
3,Kenneth Cooper fitness,"This book is less ""quantitative"" on Cooper points from his earlier aerobics books. Recognizes the need for resistance training as you get older."
4,a book like this comes once in a blue moon...,"This book was a real treat to read. After reading it, I have come to understand and respect the beauty in Japan's history. I would recomend this book to anyone that has a passion for history or Japan."
5,Words That Shook the World,"I teach an AP English Language course and this book is extremely helpful. The author has included entire speeches and has analyzed them, pointing what makes these speeches effective and memorable. This book is a must-have for teachers of rhetoric or anyone who appreciates the power of language."
1,Poor selection,I wouldn't touch a book that lists a speech delivered as an eulogy for Princess Diana as a something that 'shook the world'.It also suffers from the sin common to most Americans- being blind to most things that happen outside America. The author has no clue on what happened elsewhere in the world- for instance misses out on the powerful oratory of Nehru and Gandhi that to no small extent was reponsible for the British Empire to come crumbling down. Instead we have a roster of American presidents starting with Teddy Roosevelt and ending with Dubya..Perhaps 'Words that shook America' or even 'Words that shook me' would have been a more accurate title.
5,spectacular,"Spectacular. Profoundly moving. Spiritual. My favorite Glass work. Everyone should own this. Satyagraha, for me, is a sacred text."
1,Vastly inferior replacement door,"PetSafe Extra Large Replacement Single Flap Two-Piece, X-VA-11This product is vastly inferior to the flap on the original door. The magnets are so weak they have absolutely no magnetic pull, even when held together. The plastic is now so thin that the lower edge falls away from the flap, leaving a 1"" gap. The rest of the flap now has a 1/2"" gap around the entire perimeter, which is not acceptable in a northern climate. I would definitely NOT buy this product again and am waiting to hear from the supplier about what I can expect in a better replacement flap. I love this original pet door and do not want to replace the entire door."
4,Replacement Flap,"The replacement flaps are good, but when you own 4 big dogs that are continously running in/out the outer flap gets ripped at the corners or they are pulled out from the top. The shim/roller pulls throught the slit at the top where they connect and the flap is now on the floor, half on and half off. Have to unscrew the top plate and reattach the flap. This is a poor design, I used a second scree along the side to hold the flap. Also, why can't we order just the U-shape and not the full flap. It get expensive replaceing them every six months or so."
3,It doesn't Last,"It works great for a month or so, then the strip that keeps the door ""closed"" rips from the frame. My dogs are heavy users, in and out. This is the second time it's happened and the door is expensive enough that I don't want to keep ordering a replacement.Instead, I asked a friend to fashion a metal door that I now use when I want to close the dog door."
2,They don't work well.,"I wouldn't waste my money on this product again. The suction cups don't stick well; I bought four, and they all fell at different points. One of them actually cracked and had to be trashed when it fell. Except for the white eyes, you can't see the flashing lights because the colors purple, orange and green were too dark. I was really disappointed with this purchase."
2,dosn't fit my car,"i got this item on time and the product looks good and high qualityhowever it was worthless for me since it dosn't fit my car .in the site it says fits your car but in real life it dosn't (not even close)also you can't contact them, to solve this i must return it but im not in the US so i can'tbe aware if you won a germen car it mustly will not fit."
5,unique window into early Chinese-American life,"Hom, a scholar of Asian-American studies and an amazing linguist, collected these written-Cantonese poems originally printed in early Chinese-language newspapers from San Franciso, translated them into English, and annoted them with historical and cultural information. Where the written Cantonese differs from standard (Mandarin) written Chinese, he also provides Chinese footnotes translating the expression into Mandarin. Excellent both for historians studying Chinese Americans and for advanced-level students learning Cantonese. Chapters cover various aspects of the life of first-generation Chinese immigrants, from longing for home to dealing with abusive immigration officials."
4,Louisiana stoner rock,"Pretty good stoner rock disc. The Suplecs have a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor going on here. I mean, how metal is a song about riding on your moped? The songwriting is just different enough to stand out from the pack. A bit more raucous than anything Fu Manchu or Nebula would do. ""Wrestlin"" is a fun-filled album that just wants to rock!"
5,Sorel Boot,Ordered as a gift. The person has used it many times which has had much snow.she was very pleased. So am I
4,Sized big,"This boots looked great when they arrived, and felt good, however, they were too big, as many other buyers noted. I returned them for a size smaller, and those fit perfectly."
5,Great Boots,"I love these boots....I live in North East Washington in the mountains and the boots are great....They keep my feet warm and dry without having to put a lot of socks on....Just wear my wool socks and my boots and my feet are nice and cozy all day long...they are very durabel since I wear them to do all my chores outside.....firewood, feeding the animals and walking my dogs.....I recommend them to everybody who spents a great deal of their time ouside in the freezing cold.....Great purchase"
4,WAY too small,"I'm a 7 1/2 so I followed everyone's advise and ordered a 7. DON'T DO IT! they are way too small and I have to send them back and get an 8. Here's the kicker though.....Amazon won't exchange them for me. They will only refund my money. I got these on a great sale so they were an amazing price and Amazon won't honor the sale price by exchanging them. So now I am not only out a pair of boots on sale price, I'm out the extra I paid for expediated shipping AND out the return shipping to send them back AND they won't honor the sale price AND expect me to pay FULL price for the size 8. Becareful what you order!"
5,Best Snow Boots Ever!,"This purchase was to replace my 20+ year-old Sorel Caribou boots - I had worn the tread down on the soles of that pair. These are the best boots for frigid Chicago winters as they keep my feet toasty and dry. They are a bit heavy, but after several walks, you don't notice the weight. I wear them while taking my dog for her daily walks and can clomp through any snow drift without fear of cold feet. While some might consider the Caribou less than stylish, I'll take warm, dry feet over style any snowy day!"
2,Liners nearly impossible to put on foot. Boots arch is at wrong place. Overall poorly designed,Liners nearly impossible to get foot into. Boots arch is at wrong spot. Overall they are poorly designed. Not up to standard of years past when made in Canada.
2,Do not understand the appeal,"After much searching for a basic snowboot that wasnt incredibly ugly, I finally settled on the Sorel Caribou in Elderberry, size 5. I have a very small foot and these boots looked hideously large on. Also you cannot move your ankles at all and they feel like you have foot casts on both feet. The upper was so stiff I could barely get my foot into the boot. They are very warm however and I can see why they are popular in very cold and snowy areas. But for folks who just deal with a few minor snowstorms a season, they are really not necessary. Sadly, I returned them to Amazon the very next day."
2,Would Not Recommend,"I never actually got to test them out in the snow because it didn't really snow here in PA this winter, but I don't think they worked very well. I did wear them on some 30 degree days, and my toes were cold, which really disappointed me because I am a Southerner who just moved up North and I was expecting for the snow boots to keep my feet warm! They were also really uncomfortable. They kept rubbing and hitting against my shins. I think you also have to go up at least half a size because they run small. In short, I would not recommend these."
2,women's boots feel like men's.,"Bought these boots in what I thought was my size and they ended up being a lot bigger than I expected - both in size and weight - this is one heavy boot! Kind of hoped for the girly version of this style but it felt like a man's boot. The hazzards of mail order I guess, shipped to a US address so was not practical to exchange. On the plus side, feet are toasty and dry."
3,really wide,Warm and waterproof. It is really heavy and I really dont think its a womens size because it is so wide.
4,great boot!!!,"These boots are great, but I need to return them. They run big!!! I am usually a US9/EU40. I purchased the 9 boot. There is so much room, they feel like a 9 1/2. I will give the 8 a try."
5,GREAT SOREL BOOTS,"Love the boots; shipping was fast and item was clean, original packaging and brand new as claimed."
1,No Customer Service on Defective Product,My wifes Sorel boots literally fell apart the first time she wore them.The soles fell off! I wrote and called Sorel but they refused to reapair or replace the boots due to some aqusition that has nothing to do with me! Amazingly poor customer service and product.
4,"Great boot, problems with size","I really like these boots. I did a lot of fretting about which size to get since I am a pretty true 7.5. Most reviews said they run big and to order down. I ordered a 7 and they were just too tight, even with a thin sock. Another website that specialized in winter boots said they run true to size and to order up. I got the 8's and they are perfect with a regular sock with a little room for a thicker sock if I need it. So for me, ordering up was the best fit."
3,Irritation of size,"Hey guys from over there:)I'm from switzerland, and i've ordered those amazing shoes in women size 10(M). i got them right before christmas and was so happy. but then, big surprise. They were muuuch too big. I think it was a men size. Could anyone explain to me, what size i need, when i got european 40-41. woul be so amazing cause i really want these shoes:) What does teh size 10B(M) mean?Thanx to all answers!Greta"
5,"Oh, What a Boot!","I bought a pair of used Sorels that for the past five years have done me very well (despite their being a little too big). Now that I've bought this new pair that fits like a glove and is a very chic grey color, I shall be unstoppable! Just in time for my first Minnesota winter."
5,Great Snowboot for Urban and Rural Use,"I'm a college student in Cambridge, MA and spend half the year navigating unruly, unshoveled snowy-icy side walks. My feet have stayed completely warm and dry for three years now. While the boots are a little bulky, I find their weight ensures greater stability - I never slip when my friends do. Back home, I live on a farm in Vermont. These boots are perfect for trudging through snow and doing farm work. They take about half a winter to fully break-in and have the flexibility of regular shoes. But, they are worth the break-in period. After three years of heavy wear, they show no sign of wear and tear. I bet I'll be wearing this same pair for 5-7 more years. They are also super easy on/off."
4,wish they were a little less clunky,"I have wanted these boots for the past two years. Unfortunately, they were not available in my size last year; due to what I understand, was a fire in the factory. They are tight. Depending on the time of day that I put them on, I sometimes have to take the liner out, put my foot in it, then step into the boot with the liner on my foot already. Once on, they are very comfortable albeit clunky. Maybe would have been a better fit if they came in half sizes. I usually wear an 8 1/2, bought an 8 based on reviews; a nine would have been too big. Overall I am very pleased with my Sorel Caribou boots."
4,Tight but warm,Difficult to get the bootie on. Very tight over the arch. But lots of room after its on. Keeps toes warm and toastie.
5,Best Snow Boots,"I order these boots because I wanted a pair of snow boots that was going to last many years. They are very warm and comfortable. Some of the reviewers said the boots were way to big but I think boots are suppose to be a little big so your feet have some air and winter socks fit in them. I usually wear an 8.5 and so I order an 8 and it fit perfectly! I love these boots so much I wear them around all day when we get snow here!Fantastic boots, definitely get what you pay for!"
3,"It's ok, but not great for the money","I got this a while back for my Prism. I didn't realize at the time it was just a faceplate that pushes the application buttons on the Visor, so I was a little disappointed--seems like a lot to pay for that. Still, it was nice for games, making gameplay faster since the joystick appearance is more intuitive for games than the buttons alone. The SnapNType by TT Tech is way better though, it's an actual interface that snaps into the port on the Visor and has a Palm OS driver, rather than just being a button-pusher. Hopefully Amazon will carry that soon!"
5,Great system for the money!,"Purchased this almost two years ago. Once you manage to get this thing properly wired, it really is a great receiver, and there are many options to select from, once you get the hang of it... one plus side to the wiring, someone broke in our home a few months ago and when we came home, the receiver was halfway unplugged. The would-be robber must have started unwiring and given up. Hah! Anyway, we have pioneer surround speakers, and a yamaha subwoofer hooked up, and it really is a great theatre system. I am a picky person and this is an A+ in my book!"
5,Just like Free Willy Movies. August shows teens & others to respect & appreciate nature.,"We really enjoyed this movie. Remember, It is just a movie.Two thumbs up!!Locations don't need to be real to make a point.Scenery is very pretty. Poachers get what they deserve, brought to justice. The way that they made the animals suffer about makes you cry.August{Indian} teaches about respect & appreciation for the wildlife, nature & in real life situations about family.Teaches the kids a lot in 3 days.Had a very good happy ending.Very good movie we have seen in a very long time. Good family adventure type movie. Due to the nature of the poachers, not suitable for a young audience. More like pre-teen to Adult. Not at all a small kids movie.August{played in Free Willy Movies} playes the Indian in this movie.Very good natured and teaches us a lot throughout the movie.This movie is similar.We liked the movie & are sharing our reviews with you.It is added to our collection."
5,LILLIE,"THIS WAS A GOOD FAMILY MOVIE,WE NEED MORE LIKE IT. GREAT MOVIE TEACHING CHILDERN ABOUT NATURE.OVERALL ""TRUE HEART"" IS A GREAT MOVIE!!!"
1,true heart,"I was very disappointed with this DVD. The character development is poor and stereotypical. The plot is too simplistic and unbelievable even for children.I have lived in the area where the area was filmed. There are no wolves, kodiak bears (a few black bears), moose or elk in the Tantalus range. The producer could have put a more effort into research."
2,Too vigorous and straightforward,Jacobs' manner of conducting is too vigorous and straightforward. This opera deserves more nuanced and gentle approach. And of course piano accompaniment is a disaster.
1,Very disappointed,"This product used to be made by a French company, and the fragrance of the lotion was very pleasing and noticeable. However, the lotion we recently ordered by Five Star Fragrance Co. hardly had any smell at all. Needless to say, we were very disappointed with our purchase and will not waste our money on any more of this worthless material."
4,Excellent Product,"My daughter is 18 months old and she is a thumbsucker. I tried all possible ways to stop her from sucking her thumb. I tried Neem oil, bandaids, clove oil, soapnut extract and what not. When nothing turned out to be a success, I found this product and bought it immediately. Following the reviews by the other people on this product, I decided to start using this product on her over a weekend so that I can handle the mishaps. As others mentioned she gave me a real tough time for 2 days. But let me tell u this product works wonders. I could get my daughter to completely weane her thumbsucking and I am very happy that her gum/teeth line will no longer get effected because of this habit. Trust me ! this product works !!!!!!!!!!!"
5,amazing,"This product is truly amazing! My now 7 year old daughter has sucked her thumb since she was 1. When she turned 5 we decided it was time for her to stop because we notice that she was getting an overbite. We tried other methods to get her to stop. We tried everything for almost 2 years without success. She went to her dentist for a checkup and he suggested mavala. I was sceptical so it wasn't until almost a year later that I finally ordered mavala stop online. My daughter was reluctant to let me put it on her thumb at first then I told her I would put it on my thumb too. That was the only time I had to put it on her thumb, it worked the 1st day. And let me tell you it is the worst tasting stuff, the taste lingers for a long time. But it really works! I already notice a difference in my daughters overbite."
3,Good product - just didn't work for my 3 year old,"My 3 year old daughter has crooked teeth from being a thumb-sucker so we were looking for a way to get her to stop thumb-sucking. A friend of mine used this product with her 4 year old and it worked like a charm. The package clearly says that children 3 and under do not have fully developed taste buds so Mavala may not work on them, but we thought it was worth a try.I tested it on myself and it left a bitter taste in my mouth for hours from just one small taste. Unfortunately, my daughter did not mind it one bit. We painted several coats on in one day and it did not phase her. It was obvious that it did not affect her taste buds like it did mine. It would be excellent to stop nail biting in older children or adults. The taste is so yucky that you would not want to put your nails in your mouth at all."
5,Works Perfectly!,My 6yr old would bite his fingernails down to the point where they would bleed a bit. As soon as I applied this it worked immediately! He no longer bites his nails. This stuff is great!
3,Really really really really bitter,"This product definitely will stop you from putting your fingers in you mouth. Problem is that this product rubs off on everything, particularly if you are eating with your hands, like a sandwich, the bitterness rubs off in your food and mouth and lingers for a long long time. Or if you simply touch your mouth, you will be Assalted by bitterness. Wish it wasn't so bitter, it's really harsh."
1,Stay Away From This Stuff,If you are thinking about getting any of this stuff you need to rethink it. Does it work....yes....BUT i wouldnt use it if i were you and here is why. I bought Mavala Stop of my little girl to try to help her stop sucking her finger. I had it sitting on the table in my living room and since the bottle looked like finger nail polish she desided to open it nad try to put it on. In the process of this she spilled it on the table. It wasnt on there very long...Less that 1 min.. and when it was wiped up i noticed that it ate the finish off of the table. Now my question is this... if it can eat the finish off of a table what is it doing to your teeth and stomach?? not to mention you skin where you put it on.. I do not see where this stuff is safe and will not use it and i do not reccomend anyone else use it either
1,not the answer to your problems,"I bought this in a pinch because I needed to run a DVI cable a long length from a computer to a monitor. Not only did this thing not work, but we are pretty sure that the item itself is labeled incorrectly.Would not recommend."
5,1920x1080 crystal clear,"Installed a 50' dvi cable from my PC to a 24"" lcd and had no image unless I changed the setting to an extra low resolution. Hooked up this unit and got a perfect 1920x1080 res on the monitor. I would have paid more for it if I could have found one made in USA. sad"
2,Didn't work for me.,Ran this out of a Mac Mini that then converted into HDMI to go into TV 35 ft away. It didn't solve my signal problems to the TV. Reviews made me think it would work - but sadly it didn't for me.Oh well - its an excuse to upgrade to a newer HDMI equipped Mini.
5,Rare Australian Import Video - Extended Edition,"An extended edition of this popular Hillsong worship project, this live video adds another dimension for a fuller experience closer to being there.FOR THIS CAUSE was recorded live at the site of the Sydney 2000 Olympic games with a crowd of 5000 worshipers. Led by Darlene Zschech, it also features Reuben Morgan and Russell Fragar and the musicians and singers of Hills Christian Life Centre in a spectacular evening of worship and infectious praise in signature Hillsong style. CCM Magazine says: ""The recording is so clean, distinct and precise that if it wasn't for the cheering crowd that underlies each track, these 14 songs could pass for studio quality."""
4,Great for home educators as well as professionals,"At first glance, this seems like a text on early childhood education for sociologists, psychologists, early child educators, and college students only. As you get into the text, however, you find that the end of numerous chapters are dedicated to parents who want to give their children the best learning opportunities possible at home. Super book for parents that aren't interested in farming their kids out to daycare as soon as possible. Primary caregivers (moms or dads) this is excellent reading to give you a boost if you're thinking your job at home isn't really important and critical to your child's future."
3,Too Technical,"Good info to have and my daughter did glean a few good suggestions from four pages of practical ideas which are categorized by age. However, this was not the down-to-earth layman's version of ""Why school should be postponed."" Glancing through some of the chapter titles gives you a good idea of what type of reading this will be...""Dilemmas in Early Childhood Policies and Practices"", ""Neuropsychological Factors in learning"", etc. Good for someone who wants to bolster an intellectual argument for the author's premise, which is, by the way, a good one."
3,"boring, not bad info though","The information is good. It's just boring, and too technical. I didn't even finish the book. If you are looking for that sort of thing then you'll be fine with this selection. If you are just a parent looking to learn more, and boost your confidence about homeschooling (and wanting to learn why public school isn't good for kids) then this is NOT your answer. The print is also very small. I have great eyes and I hated reading it!I enjoyed Teach Your Own John Holt~Shauna"
5,Love this stuff!,"I was introduced to this gumbo dinner mix by my sister, when I visited her in Beaumont. I was fortunate to find it on Amazon, at a very attractive price. When we fix it we add a bit more rice, which doesn't affect the quality (and I love rice). The gumbo has a nice bite to it, but is not overly spicy. (I like real spicy food so I add a couple of dashes of Tabasco sauce.) It freezes well, and a frozen serving makes a wonderful breakfast dish after four minutes in the microwave."
2,Much too spicy for me,This rating is based on my personal taste - has way too much cayenne pepper for me. People who like reallyspicy food would probably love it.
1,HOT.HOT HOT,"I like cajun food, but NOT THIS STUFF! if you like to TASTE what you are eating you won't like this. This stuff is so HOT you CAN'T TASTE IT, IT JUST BURNS!!! I'll never buy it again."
2,Area rug,"Stands out with brilliant color, very nice design.However, it arrived rolled, not on a bolt just hand rolled tight. I have had it down on the floor (in a small room, not where it was intended) for over a month, and it still does not lay flat. I purchased it for a walkway in the living room. It looks terrible all wrinkled. Waste of money.Home Dynamix should invest in ""card board bolts"" to roll, and ship this size rug on."
3,Is this product tested on animals?,"I'd prefer not to use products from companies that do animal testing. I've used the Rainbow henna in red, but I was suspicious as to whether it was real henna since it didn't stain my hands at all and it only called for leaving it on my hair an hour, which high quality henna I've used stained my hands terribly and took hours on my head to take. I'm not complaining on the price, though. It did leave a reddish stain, but lightened my hair a bit. I'd like to try the blonde to see if it lightens even more, but again, I'm wondering what other dyes or ingredients are added to this product as it doesn't seem like real henna to me. I'm also wondering about animal testing esp. since this henna does not seem 100% natural as it claims."
2,didnt work for me,"this was my first time using a henna product of any kind so I won't give the product a 1 star because its always possible i didnt do something right (even though its just add water) the product smells like cooked spinach which isnt pleasant at all but its natural so i went with it hoping that when it dried the smell would go away, no such luck. also the product didnt rinse out - after rinsing and repeating until my hair felt stripped i just twisted and air dried, the next day i still have what looks like coffee grinds in my hair - gross!!and the biggest disappointment of all is my hair is not red - i wore a heat cap for 60 mins and there is no red in my hair - i started with a medium shade of brown and i feel like it looks darker than when i started which is okay because i ordered the dark drown too, but i think i will try a different company before i give the spinach head a go again."
1,Not pure henna and does not stain the hair shaft.,"Not knowing a lot about henna before buying this product, I went ahead and bought it. Henna is one color... red. There is not burgundy/red/brown, etc. Henna gets darker each time you put it on and should be mixed with an acidic liquid like grape juice or lemon juice, not water. It has to sit out for at least 12 hours for the dyes to oxidize. You don't just mix it with hot water and put it on your head.This dye did NOTHING for my hair. It only dried it out and made it feel like I had sand all in my hair. Not pleasant. If you truly want to use henna check out [...] and good luck in henna adventure."
2,no color,"supposly this is a light brown henna color for the hair, But when i used it and left it 45 min to dry, my hair was still black! it didnt work at all! I used half of it! overall its weak Henna"
4,Nice product,I was pleased with the results I got from using the persian blonde henna. In addition- the instructions in the package were very clear. My natural hair color is a dirty blonde and after years of highlighting my hair is a bit damaged and this henna left my hair shiny for the first time in ages. I did not use heat so I did not see a big color change but was still very satisfied.
3,Persian Burgundy not red,"I love the quality of Rainbow Henna products, but I'm giving the Persian Burgundy only three stars because it just simply adds no red. The results of this color on brown hair is just brown, with not even red highlights. Since I ordered so much of it, I'm going to order Persian Red and mix the two together."
2,"no noticeable change in color, very hard to work with","the henna did not change the color of my daughters hair and was very 'muddy' in the application. it smelled awful, and was very difficult to remove."
3,Pros and Cons,"My hair is medium brown with very subtle strawberry blonde highlights. I wanted something to brighten my hair and enhance my blonde highlights. Oh, and also cover the 12 or so grays. I used the Light Brown previously and although it covered my few grays really well and made my few artificial highlights more golden (all of which I liked), it seemed to darken the rest of my hair. That's why I tried Persian Blonde. I barely notice any change at all and it doesn't cover the grays as well as the brown, although it covers them somewhat. I thought I might try it again with chamomille tea, as the instructions suggested and, if that's not enough, then the next time I will add lemon juice, also as the instructions suggest for brightening. It may have made my hair look a little ash blondish, but it's so barely noticeable, I'm not sure if I am imagining it."
5,PPD free hair coloring,"After skin tests showed an allergy to PPD, I had to find another way to color my hair. This gives me the natural chestnut brown color I wanted, and it's in better condition than when I used commercial hair coloring products. I have to leave it on a bit longer, but that's offset by having to color much less often. Satisfied with the product and the vendor's quick shipping."
1,Not good,"I have African American extremely kinky hair that is shoulder length I was using henna mainly to condition my hair. The raindow henna has very tiny pieces of leaves and bark that remained stuck in my hair after spending an entire hour washing out the henna. On top of that, it made my hair very tangled and dry. My gray hair is a weird orange color. I do recommend this product especially if you have kinky hair. It's very hard to get this stuff out of your hair. I'm going to try the Jamila henna next."
4,It does a fairly good job,"Garmin eMap is a very easy to use GPS receiver with the necessary features to provide accurate and efficient driving aid. That includes address finding (when loaded with Garmin Metroguide Maps) and Points of Interest finding, Show Next Exit feature and a complete trip computer. The Garmin Metroguide Maps are very detailed and the 120x160 pixels eMap's LCD display (with backlight) gives the user a good view and tracking capablity in the surrounding streets and roads. The combination of these features with its small size and the lower price comparing to other mapping units, makes the eMap an option very hard to match. Pros: Good detailed maps, easy to use, address finding capability, small size and lighweight, despite its 120x160 pixels displayCons: It's not as sturdy as regular Garmin and Magellan units and no lighted keys"
1,Good product-bad maps,"The emap itself is a great product-easy to use and very intuitive. The problem I encountered was the quality of the maps on the metro guide. It's important to note as the built in maps don't have the detail I was looking for. I found other map programs to be considerably more accurate. If the maps were as good as some of the others, I would rate this a 5. One other problemn is the connector. I could see where it could be easily broken and is hard to attach. They could have done a far better job on that."
2,"Good as a first GPS, but not for driving","Perhaps I chose the wrong unit. I was hoping this GPS would be helpful while driving. It doesn't plot out trips, and the Metroguide software, while good generally, misses many streets. The screen is clear but small and difficult to read when in direct sunlight. The GPS tracking is excellent and accurate. For use while driving, it looks like the Street Pilot (or Street Pilot III) is far superior."
1,Poor Receive,"Lowrance has a better GPS engine, and do to the fact that Garmin seems to sell maps that are out of sight in cost I use the I-finder, these maps are on a web site for the down loading. I have ran Lowrance and Garmin Side by Side and find the Lowrance will out do the Garmin by about 25 percent. The buy in cost is an issue when you do not have extra money to spend."
5,Great Shampoo!,"I'm very picky about shampoo, and my hair dresser swears by this stuff, and now, so do I. Its very easy on tbe hair and always leaves my hair with an amazing shine I can't describe. Smells great too."
5,Amazing Products!,"In January I had a condo fire, and much of my jewelry sat in water for two weeks until I was allowed back in to recover my possessions. I hate the way other jewelry polishes and tarnish removers ruin my nails and make such a mess, so I ordered. It's AMAZING!! It removed all the tarnish and ""grossness"" and cleaned up without harshness, and best of all, was gentle on my hands. The residue of the creme silver polish just rinses off, and I swear my fingers felt softer. The liquid cleaner got all my pearls, as well as my semi-precious gemstones back in tip-top shape. I'm a customer for life!!!"
4,Good Stuff,The cleaning paste and liquid do a really good job cleaning jewelry that has been really hard to get clean before.
4,Circuit Tester,Pretty good sturdy circuit tester that I take and use at my rental properites to make sure the electricians have done their work properly and have actually caught some outlets that were not grounded properly.
1,Worked once then quit,When I went shopping for a GFCI tester I was not looking for the cheapest. I was hoping if I paid a bit more than my Harbor Freight special I would get my money's worth. I was wrong. This tester quit after the second time I used it. As always Amazon has a great return policy so I can shop again. I will be sure not to buy anything from this mfg. again.
4,A Sailor I am Not!,"Having only sailed a few times with friends, I consider myself an armchair sailor. I picked up this book at a friend's house and couldn't put it down. The story about the wooden boat is wonderful, but the stories about friends and family are so interwoven that you feel you are a part of Mr. Coomer's family. I look forward to reading more of his books."
3,"Could've used more info, but . . .","As a Beatlemaniac, I was looking for a bit more from George--like about his guitars, more dish on his bandmates--not on car racing. But I did learn some new things about his childhood."
3,A little short on background info.,"For fans wanting bio. and background info this isn't the book for you. Written in 1980 the book is more about the song lyrics. There are roughly 75 pages of personal recollections sprinkled with quips from Derek Taylor, 50 photo's (all very nice), and 300+ pages of song lyrics (with insight into the inspiration of his songs) spanning George's career. OK stuff, but not what I was hoping for.Definitely not enough history and reminiscing, but the book points out that reliving the past was not George's way."
2,Disappointing,"The only thing of interest in this book are the notes about how he wrote each of his songs or what they were about. Unfortunately, the song lyrics and notes account for about 80% of this book. If you're looking for an informative biography, especially regarding his Beatle years, don't look here. The autobiography section of the book has very little information of interest. a very disappointing book."
3,Not what people say it is...,"I went to the book store to find an autobiography on George Harrison; and I came across this. 10% of this book is about the life of George, 20% of this book were pictures; & 70% of the rest were songs. This is not considered an autobiography in my opinon. An autobiograph is a story about your whole life, from when you were a little kid, to your present time. This book didn't live up to what it was suppose it be. I gave it 3 stars because, I found the last part very interesting, on why & how he wrote his songs & what they mean; and I liked what his wife wrote in the introduction too. If you want to get this for your George Harrison collection, then this is for you, but I would get it at the library first before buying this. I still love you George."
4,My Sweet George!,"Purchased this copy to replace my original hardcopy which has gone missing. It's been many years since I read the original and I was jonesing for some George after watching Living in the Material World (2011). I would expect every diehard George fan would consider this a ""must read"", myself included. For the casual fan, as others have written, this is not a true autobiography. It's a collection of memoirs, written by George and pal Derek Taylor. It's a look back into various periods of George's life (starting with childhood through the Beatles and into the late 70's.). In addition to the memoirs, there are the lyrics to his works, in his own hand, along with personal photos that I suspect first appeared in the book.It's an entertaining, funny and sentimental look into George's life, and the values, spirituality and philosophy that guided him through the late 70's."
4,George Harrison book,"Once again, another great book. I. Me, Mine was a very interesting book.If you are or were a fan or not, this gave me a good insight as to the lifeof George Harrison. I highly recommend this book."
3,i miss you gentle soul,"Yes. I miss George, what Beatle fan doesn't. I daily think of him and John, and can't help mourn for these tragic losses. I bought this book used here on Amazon. I was eager to read it, and it was good. But it was not great. I was looking for more of the author's insight and wisdom, more personal facts. But there aren't too many of those. Not surprising, though, considering it is George. The lyrics, written in his own hand, are priceless.Had I to do over, I would still buy this book, because it is precious to me to have a little piece his life, and mine too, to remember. He so loved his God. Let us be joyful that he is with Him in paradise. Thank you Amazon for allowing me to share my thoughts."
3,for collectors only,NOT AN AUTOBIOGRAHY :3 parts here #1. Parts of an interview with D. Taylor puttings the pieces together. Not that enlightning. #2. Photos=nice. #3. George's songs with notes about why and how the somg was written-nice.
1,"A misguided, directionless effort","Seldom have I been as disappointed in a book as Fields of Battle. From the book jacket material I expected a discussion of the effects of geography and economics on the various campaigns in North America. Instead the book is a mishmash of travelogue, personal reminiscences and recountings of selected battles. The connection between the last chapter of the book and what preceded it escapes me entirely.And there are enough errors in the book to make one doubt its credibility. Mr. Keegan asserts that the capital of Virginia had not yet been moved to Richmond in 1781; my source material from Williamsburg states that the removal of the capital to Richmond had been approved in 1779 and accomplished in 1780. Sloppily, too, Mr. Keegan at one point locates Cape Hatteras in South Carolina.Still, the book is written to keep the reader's attention. Unfortunately, the lack of a coherent purpose and the errors are fatal problems for this effort."
2,Keegan's Book is less a history than a commercial venture,"John Keegan has a pretty good reputation as an historian, but in this venture he has put together a hurried and clearly commercial product that does not do him justice. His understanding of the American Indian and how they made war is pitiful. He quotes Lewis & Clark as authority for the fact that the Blackfoot are part of the Sioux tribe, a mistake unlikely to be made by an American expert. He further considers the Sioux to have been the most warlike of the plains tribes, and in that he is just wrong. The Comanche hold that honor for their continued battles with the Spanish and then the Texans over a period of more than a hundred years."
2,Philosophy over content,"While a very well written book full of interesting tales of the authors visits to America and insights into many of the major battles, for someone looking for details of America's battles this fell far short of the mark. I was sadly disappointed when compared to his other works. If you are looking for a historical travelogue buy it"
1,A Disappointing series of personal memories,"I was very disappointed by this book. I've enjoyed some of Keegan's other works, such as ""A History of Warfare."" But this book is less history and more memoir of his love affair with the United Sates. The history that is included has many factual errors, such as thomas Jefferson living to 1833.Apparently this book was marketed appropriately in the UK, but the US publishers apparently wanted to cash in and gave it a misleading title and jacket. If you want to know about John Keegan, read this book. If you want to know about the wars of North America, look elsewhere."
2,A Disappoint,"""Fields of Battle"" by John Keegan is a disappointment if you expect the book to fulfill its basic thesis. The book is designed to explore and describe four major military battles that took place on the North American continent, instead what you get is a great deal of remembrance and travelogue interpersed with discussions of the battles. Additionally, the final chapter on the Wright Brothers invention of the airplane seems totally out of place.When the author stays on topic the material is quite interesting with the chapter on Custer's Last Stand the best written. Not having read any of Keegan's other works I am reluctant to read any others despite his fine reputation as a historian and military affairs journalist."
3,Chops galore,"Don Reno is the standout on this short but punchy compilation. His blistering runs all over the banjo neck are truly impressive. While no one could fail to appreciate Mr. Reno's chops, the album may not be the best choice for the bluegrass purist or someone who is more interested in old-time music. Unlike Ralph Stanley, for instance, who continually channels the high lonesome sound of the mountains, Mr. Reno's playing is more about technical achievement. But it is no less impressive for that. Listen to his version of Limehouse Blues, and then listen to Django Reinhardt's version of the same, and you'll hear two incomparable masters of their instruments playing in their own unique way."
1,No Way.... Way too tight!,"I've now had the third case sent to me. They kept saying it must have been the wrong case in the box. When you try to close the case the credit card piece hits the side edge of the Prism and you have to force it over the front to close it. When shut the velcro strap is pulling up from tension and the corners of the case are pulling up for being so tight. Their product people finally said that they don't make a case yet actually for the Prism sinc it's such a new product. Imagine that... the box says ""Designed for the Handspring Visor Prism handheld."" NOT!!"
2,Disappointing organizer case...,"My main complaint with this case is that when I pack a few business cards and a folded piece of paper into the provided slots, the bulk causes buttons to be pressed on the visor (Visor Prism) and affects battery life.It does, however, look great and the visor snaps right in with no problems. As long as you don't try to use the card slots, its not a bad case, but just not what I needed."
5,What are they talking about!,The prism fits perfectly in the case and with no problems snaping it into place or closing the cover with credit cards inside.
4,"Quick and easy read, lots of valuable tips","This book is succinct and easy to reference. I have 20+ years customer service experience and WOULD recommend this book to anyone who is open-minded to trying new tools and techniques. If you are having trouble with customers, change your approach. This book will help you do just that.What the world needs now is more customer service!"
4,Fairly pleased,"This book was exactly what I expected it to be. I love that it not only gives you ideas for how to respond, it also breaks it down to what skills are used in the wording (such as empathy). My customer service agents are utilizing this book to help improve their quality of customer service. A lot can be learned from this book."
5,spectacular view of a vanished world,"It is a mystery to me why these books are all going out of print. Singer is one of the great 20c masters of the short story. I would characterise them as genius: they evoke lives in the deepest sense, offering a glimpse of an utterly alien existence.I was attracted by the title, and delightfully surpirsed at the power of the writing, including stories of neglected sholars, demons and harmless goblins, and the way of life of pre-WWII Poland. Every story is superbly crafted.Warmly recommended. This writer deserves to be read."
2,"Author in love with his style, not the story","An intresting subject ruinied by over doses of the authors observations and prose. This may be due to the outcome of the search. The book starts out with an intresting premise the search for two sunken ships said to contain gold. From this premise I was subjected to an overwhealming ardous discription of the ""cast of chracters"" and there problems, interspersed with descriptions of there mission. My favorite parts of this book were the descriptions of the two ships; there loss; and the effort to find them. I read this book in less than one day (as I scanned by the portions I felt trivilized the story."
1,Bad Software Design,There's nothing really educational here. You control a character to jump on platforms to collect numbers and other objects. Visit the Sesame Street website for better and more educational games.None of the characters speak as far as I can remember.This was a disappointment and a wasted opportunity to use the cute characters for something educational.
5,Placido Domingo contemporary songs,"I had bought this as an LP probably 20 years ago and thru various moves do not know what happened to it, but I never forgot how beautiful this album was. After 20 years and now having it on CD, none of the magic was lost. The song choices are terrific and the title song, Save Your Nights for Me is positively wonerful. He sings many terrific romantic songs and his Time After Time could not be done better. He is in a category all by himself whether singing opera or contemporary. Don't miss this one if you are a fan!"
5,SAVE YOUR NIGHTS AND LISTEN TO THIS CD!!,"Placido Domingo has always been one of my favourite singers and this is the CD version of an album from the 80's I had been looking for. You'll not regret listening to it. The first song is a jewel, ""Love came for me"" from the lovely movie ""Splash"". Summing up, the 10 songs talk about love and are popular ones. For people who are not fond of opera arias, but appreciate a strong and marvelous voice, that's the CD, even though I like very much to listen to opera arias. The duet with Maureen McGovern, ""A love until the end of time"" combines two of the best singers who own unforgettable voices. Both pop music and opera enthusiasts will like this CD. Love is really wonderful!"
5,Got this for my Dad and he really likes it...,"He spent most of his vacation, reading and perusing it. He really likes SH, I wasn't sure if he had read all of the stories or not... so I got him this. He was very pleased."
5,Terrific Book,Layer 2- Layer 3 networking laid bare. This book is the TCP/IP Illustrated for Layer 2 and Layer 3. While the former did it for Layer4-Layer7 this one does it for the lower layers.Buy it without any regret. U will love it. The author definitely knows what she is talking about.
4,my dad wont wear it.,"i bought this for my dad for christmas since he doesnt have any and is into ferrari...i guess that was a rather stupid idea in the first place considering he wears his torn khaki pants and ""Rose Bowl"" sweater everywhere..but as far as i know it smells nice, i like the cologne, he just likes the box it came in."
1,The Pinto of all Cologne's,"I bought this because I was impressed with Jaguar Prestige and thought I would give this a whirl. For such a name as ""Ferrari"" you would think a very good product as the name screams of quality and luxury. My expectations were let down, and let down in a big way.The scent is very strong, so one spray will smell up a room. It makes you nauseated after a few minutes. If you are ""sensitive"" then this stuff will KILL you so heed my warning. I will use the rest to spray my cat box between cleanings since it is a slight improvement of that, albeit not much."
5,Possibly the best commentary of Bhagavadgita every written,"S. Radhakrishnan's is the best commentary I have ever read on the background to the meaning of the Gita and it's application to correct daily living. I own eleven translations of the Gita that I have read and studied for the past ten years and this is by far the most moving of them all. Each verse or group of verses is dealt with in a sensitive and often times inspiring manner. If one loves the Gita one will grow to love the God who inspired it even more by reading and rereading this text. A close second, in depth and feeling is Juan Muscaro's introduction to his translation of the Gita (Penguin Classics). If you want to learn to live a better life, this is a highly recommended source of wisdom."
4,Great Old Fashion Meodrama,"Great change of pace for Doris Day who plays airline stewardess Julie Benton. After marrying Louis Jourdan, an overly jealous man, she discovers that he killed her first husband in order to have her. She is unable to get help from the police because it is her word against his and because the law at that time stated that a wife could not testify against her husband.The movie is tense and keeps you on the edge of your seat as Julie tries to escape her pyscopathic husband. The climax is dynamite although it does stretch your imagination a little bit. Alright, a big bit but remember this movie was made at a time when people went to the movies to be entertained by melodramatics and not be buried in reality. This is one of the better melodramas with Miss Day giving a fine performance. The title song.JULIE, is beautiful and stayed on top of the Hit Parade for many weeks. Alhough this film is in black and white, the Carmel scenery is gorgeous."
