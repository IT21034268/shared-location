5,Fantastic.,"Does everything it states it does. Very impressed by the swath it cleans WITHOUT ANY streaking. I did half the driveway with this unit, and half with just a nozzle. You can really tell the difference. Makes for a very professional looking job and cuts job time in half.The hovercraft mode is great when moving over rough surfaces like driveways, where it would normally catch or skip.The unit is light, and not very hard to move around, and the adjustable pressure settings make it easy to switch from hard surfaces like concrete to soft like wood siding.I have it coupled to a G2600VH. You'll need to use the included adapter to use it with this model.I do wish it had a T handle."
4,A good product for a great price.,"Karcher did a good thing when they produced this product. It fits almost any pressure washer out there, and it does come with an extension wand. I have a large concrete patio that needs cleaning every spring. I attached this unit to a 2550 PSI Craftsman pressure washer and turned it loose on the concrete surface. It did a really good job in cleaning. You do need to go slowly back and forth, or you will end up with swirl marks.The downside of this product is that many pieces of dirt and other foreign matter get caught in the little bristle brush that surrounds the outside rim of the unit. I was unable to remove much of this after using it on the patio, but it didn't seem to affect the performance at all.Is is very light weight and cut the cleaning time in half. Much easier on the arms to, as you don't have to stand there and swing a nozzle back and forth.Definanly a good product for a really good price."
5,Excellet for anyone washing large areas...,"I work part time for the condo association where I live in Orlando. I purchased this product to use with the pressure washer by the same manufacturer. This made the massive amount of pressure washing problem free with easy use, adjustable settings, and clean operation. I found that I would go a little to fast from time to time because of how easy it was to move. After slowing down a little, I can get a clean wash with just one pass."
1,Cheaply made - not up to karcher standards,Bought this based on good reviews - mine lasted 40 seconds.The two spray nozles that rotate are held in place by the slimmest of plastic lugs (think less than half the thickness of a comb tooth)so under pressure they continue to pop out.very dissapointed.
4,Great Product,The T-Racer worked as advertised. Cleaned sidewalks and driveway areas with ease.I plan to try it on my roof.Much easier and faster compared to switching pressure tips to get areas with tough dirt.
4,Great for homeowners- time saver,"It took a two day job down to one. It covers a big area quite a bit faster than using a straight nozzle. It cleans well on normal dirt for driveways and sidewalks. The only bad thing is that if you have heavy dirt, you will have to switch back and forth to a nozzle to keep the dirt from drying back on to the area you just cleaned. I had to do a medium sized area with the Karcher which cleaned well, then switch to a nozzle to push all the dirt and mud off the newly cleaned surface. Sounds like a pain, but it is still faster than going with a straight nozzle and less stress on your back."
5,As Important as Gasoline,"Just used this accessory for the first time and I can't imagine using my pressure washer without it. It's like painting with a 12"" paintbrush instead of a 1"" brush when covering a large area. Does as good a job in cleaning as the nozzle and obviously takes a lot less time. This is a great piece of equipment at a great price. Buy one, you won't be sorry."
4,Pleased with purchase,"The surface cleaner works as described. I was hoping for more cleaning power; however, my aggregate patio was so dirty perhaps this was an unfair initial test. I am hoping that additional cleaning efforts will remove more and more dirt from the aggregate. It definitely covers more area faster than using a spray nozzle only. Plus there is not as much water splattering on me as I use it versus a spray nozzle."
3,Karcher surface cleaner,"Worked great on the rougher surface of the driveway, but wasn't that effective on finer surfaces like walkways, patio, and my wood deck. I tried coating the walkway, patio, and deck with chemicals but it did not noticeably improve performance. I will use this for driveway maintenance but won't waste my time with other surfaces."
4,Nice,The quality is good. It's not as wide/tall as the picture makes it seem. The ruffles make it bunch up. Still very lovely. I got it for a wedding and it looked great.
3,A cliched tale of good and evil - guess who's the good guy,"This is an entertaining book with little to recommend it on the human genome side. It's full of cliches and poorly drawn analogies. The story of the worm project (for which the author later received the Nobel Prize) was terrific, if poorly written. Sulston is a guy who clearly hates Venter and is full of venom, only thinly disguised by his holier than thou attitudes - poorly argued for his side, at that.The book is half good in that it presents a notable first person episode in science, but is too self statisfied and non-reflective to be useful in understanding the important questions raised by the book."
4,Pretty Good,"I found the instruction a bit long winded, but that is my opinion. The form is well presented and a tad overly ornamental but it is good overall."
5,"Astonishing, would be a good word...","I use this calendar in conjunction with ""Astrology for the Millions."" (AFTM) As a non-astrologer, it's a quick lookup for interpretations. I keep journal notations in the datebook. One day, I was catching up with my entries. I was astonished to see on the very days I had noted, ""very sick today,"" or ""vacation starts,"" the interpretations (on the aspects in relation to my birth chart in AFTM) had said: illness and poor health indicated; travel very likely. I made a note of these aspects so I can watch out for them next time!"
1,BAD chromatic aberration,"I bought this lens for its range to be used with my 40D. It would be perfect if it hadn't some serious issues with chromatic aberration (worst on the short end.) You can see purple/green fringes on any high (and sometimes not so high) contrast in the picture at 100% view. Color rendition is mediocre at best, focus tends to be on the soft side. The EF-S 18-15mm that came with my XTi shoots crisper, less distorted, more colorfull pictures than the EF-S 17-85 with very little CA! Looks like there is a reason for Canon not posting MTF charts for this lens..On top of that, the lens in *not* supported by DPPs Lens Aberration Correction function (ver. 3.2 at the time this review was written), which renders this EF-S 17-85mm f4-5.6 IS USM totally useless for me.If I can't return it (3rd party vendor..) I'll try to have Canon ""calibrate"" it and take it as a lesson -- in the future I'll stick to L lenses, the 17-40 will cover my indoor and landscape needs nicely."
2,Beware of a major problem with this lens,"After around 3 years of use, the lens starts failing to capture pictures with ""Err 01"". This seems to be a very common problem. Search the internet for details. I have burnt my hands :-("
2,This lens will break,"This lens will break on you. The ribbon cable in the zoom lens will short out due to a design flaw which basically causes you to lose the 17-35 end of the zoom. It is a very common issue that will cost $150-$200 to fix which almost is enough to buy another one used. The lens itself is not terribly sharp either, buy the newer 15-85mm or buy a 3rd party lens near this range but do not buy this lens or you will find that your investment was wasted."
2,Think twice before you get this one,"I've compared this lens with the kit lens (18-55mm, $100.-, cheapest Canon lens) and couldn't believe my eyes. The kit lens was a clear winner, whether in wide, mid, or tele range!! I was outraged and happy I didn't buy it. With image stabilizer on the images very not only darker, but noticably more blurred.I tested myself because of the many conflicting opinions I read on the net. Please, before you buy it, compare. I do hope the 650.- 17-85mm was just a bad piece or else this is outrageous."
5,Very pleased,"I really like this lens and have recommended it, along with the Canon Xti body, to several people already. I especially like the image stabilization feature. I also have, and enjoy the 70-300mm IS lens by Canon."
3,Average lens,"This is a dedicated APS-C lens. Effectively on a Canon with a 1.6x factor, this lens is a 27mm - 136mm full frame (read 35mm) lens. Great as a 'walk-around lens'.Although it suffers some very mild distortion, vignetting is almost imperceptible.This is nice lens....it's not a lens that will get you rave reviews from fellow online review 'clubs'. But it is a good lens. I took it to Europe for 10 days and then to Washington's San Juan Islands and it did very very well. I was proud of my picture quality. For a vacation trip this is a good choice.I put a quality B+W UV coated filter on it ($50). I worry about damage and not impairing the quality of the lens with a cheap filter.Shoot this lens wide open at f4.0 for the greatest sharpness through out its range. It will stop down to 5.6 as you pass 35mm.All in all a good lens with a nice focal length.My Camera: Canon 30D"
1,Zoom blocks at the wide end of the range,"The lens has a design issue. one of the screws cvontrolling the zoom loosens and over time results in your lens blocking at the ""wide"" end of the zoom range (somewhere between 17 and 20). Canon would charge you around $200 to fix the issue. There is a description of how to fix it on the Internet, but this is for people with above average manual dexterity. There are also vigneting issues at the ""wide"" end of the zoom range. For this price, the quality leaves A LOT to be desired."
5,Great Lens !,"This lens is a great lens not only because it is extremely versatile in its range going from a wide angle to a telephoto but also because I found the quality of the pictures that I got from it to be excellent.The Image Stabilizer is a good tool to have in situations where there is not a lot of light.You can drop your shutter speed down,have enough light for a good exposure, and not have an out of focus picture. I would highly recommend this lens. I have a 70-200 L series Canon lens that I am very happy with because of it's high optic quality, but I have no problem at all, and all the confidence in the world using this ""S"" series lens in any situation that I feel to be appropriate at the time."
3,"Great all around, not that reliable.","Is a great all around lens for a 1.6 sensor.It took decent pictures but nothing that will take your breath away.It's a great kit lense replacement.My aperture ring is now stuck. after more than a year and around 20k shot'sI'm not satisfied with that failure so soon.I always take good care of all my equipment, the camera has at least twice that amount of shots (xti) and is working great with the 18-55A camera failure at this point, will be more close to failure (getting to 50k shot's) but not a lens, or not this one at least.(Update)The repair by a canon authorize center, is $180.00 , they will replace 2 parts as they said is necessary in order to avoid future problems...It will take almost 7 weeks to get it done."
4,Great lens for the price but with some problems,"I shot thousands of images with this lens and it is great value for what it is worth. The problem seems to be with the auto-focus. Strangely, this is not my only Canon lens with this problem (the other one is 50mm 1.4 lens). The auto-focus of my 17-85mm lens just suddenly died about a year and half since I bought it. It was not on warranty by then (it was new and covered by a one year warranty when I bought it) and its repair by Canon cost $100. It worked for two more years and then the auto-focus started malfunctioning again. It works OK at 17-20mm but fails altogether at 80-85mm. So I am thinking of spending another $100 on fixing it. Of course, that means that the overall cost of this lens for me will be $200 extra plus shipping costs..."
3,O.K. but not great,Mega distortion @ 17mm. Cleans up fast once you move up from 17mm. CA's more than you would like to see but these (distortions and CA's) can be eliminated with Canon's included DPP software for EOS camera's. Its included free with a EOS camera or can be downloaded from Canon's site. Note that the above features only work if you shoot in RAW. Thumbs down to Canon for not including a lens hood for this lens. They want about $35 for a molded piece of plastic.On the upside the range is very versatile. Being 28-135 in the 35mm format. Also has a metal mount not plastic like some of there other entry level lens. Has the superior USM focus the newer cheaper Canon 18-135 lacks.Note: There are two of these 17-85 lens available. The more desirable Made in Japan version and a less desirable Made in Taiwan version. Most EOS kits shipped with the Taiwan version.
4,Best affordable walk-around lens,"I got this lens with my 30D and have found it to be a useful walkaround lens, able to handle just about any situation I threw at it, other than very low-light situations. Even in dim illumination it was able to function fairly well, thanks to the image stabilization, which let me shoot at shutter speeds as slow as 1/4 second hand-held. I wasn't thrilled with the barrel distortion at the wide end of the zoom range, but I was able to fix this using Photoshop's Lens Correction adjustment with no problem. It's simply an additional post processing step that's necessary."
4,Not an L but not bad,Lens is sharp (at least the copy I have is sharp) and meets expectations. Works well with 20D as a walk around lens
1,Soft With Horrible Vignetting,"I just purchased this lens and I noticed horrible vignetting through the viewfinder the second I mounted it to my camera. I ran some tests at all focal lengths and apertures which confirmed my initial observation.The vignetting is unbelievable at 17mm. I've been a photographer for 35 years and I've NEVER seen a lens this bad.This is unacceptable for any lens, much less a Canon branded lens.The vignetting is not the only problem. There is nothing sharp about this lens except when stopped down.Pardon me, but if I buy a 17mm f4.0 lens is it too much to ask that I actually be able to use it at this focal length and aperture?I'm returning this lens immediately."
4,Good Value-Beware of broken aperture wire issue,"This is actually a replacement lens-my first 17-85 broke after half a year of ownership(broken aperture wire). Since I could not do without this lens (I was left with only the 70-300 lens on 4th of July in Vegas), I had to either buy a replacement or get it fixed quickly.Overall built quality is OK, the price was economical and I am happy with the picture quality. Recommend for those who are on a limited budget like myself,"
5,Much better quality than the default lens,"I purhcased this lens to replace the one that came with my EOS 30D camera, and I was indeed impressed with the significant improvement of picture quality.I made my purchase based on others' reviews and they were indeed accurate and helpful. This lens definitely worths keeping as the new default lens for my 30D. I am not a professional and was only trying to shoot sharper and more color-rich images of my kids and landscapes, and it seemed I did reach my goal with this lens."
2,Only virtue is zoom range.,"The only virtue of this lens is the zoom range.Chromatic abberation, highly abnormal distortion, and slow aperture above 17mm make this a bad value.The new Canon 18-55 IS is much better optically. Even better, go for the Tamron 17-50 f/2.8 or the Canon 17-40L for a bit more. This is the worst lens I have ever used without a doubt.Check photozone.de for detailed comparisons of the lenses and save yourself some money and get quality instead!"
3,versatile but no match to EF 17-40 F4L in image quality,"a good compromise if you need a walk-around lens with this range (equivalent to 28-135 mm), but the image quality pales before those taken with canon ef 17-40L F4L (equivalent to 27-65 mm). The difference in color range, depth, and subtlety is between a pale supermarket tomato and a ripe one just picked from the vine. If you shoot largely wide to normal, EF 17-40 F4L is well worth the price difference. 17-85, of course, has IS, but this can be compensated for by boosting the ISO on your digital camera. An added bonus: if you upgrade to a full-frame DSLR, you can keep your 17-40 F4L (17-85 works only with the APC-size sensor). If you miss the longer reach, just get closer to the action. You'll get better pictures this way."
4,Good medium grade lens,"Bought the Canon EF-S 17-85mm f/4-5.6 lens to use as a general purpose lens on my Canon 40D. Overall I am pleased with the quality of the optics. It's not a ""L"" lens so don't expect it to perform like one. One complaint I have is that the zoom ring feels a little loose and wobbly. However the focus ring is tight and precise.I have owned a Sigma 17-70mm lens in the past which is the direct competitor of the Canon 17-85mm. The Sigma has a bigger aperture of f2.8 but a lower range than the Canon. The Canon provides fulltime manual focus and IS, which is not available on the Sigma. Personally I liked the pictures the Canon lens produced over that of the Sigma."
5,Fulfilled All Expectations,"The lens fulfilled all of our expectations as to quality of portraits and field of view flexibility.The stabilization aspect is a great help, although it doesn't compensate for someone pushing the shutter too fast in low light conditions.Highly recommend this lens as the standard use lens for the Canon Rebel XT."
2,Unimpressive lens for the price.,"After weeks of debating the merits of which lens to purchase along with an EOS 20D, I settled on the 17-85mm IS in the kit. There are other lenses out there in the same price range that perform much better. The biggest problem I had with the lens was the vignetting (darkening in the corners as seen in most of the sample images from Michael Lane.) Another issue was the amount of distortion (straight lines coming out curved.)The lens is pretty sharp in the center and not bad at the edges. Depending upon the types of pictures being taken, the distortion and vignetting may not be an issue.I have since returned the lens and purchased an EF 28-135mm F3.5-5.6 IS and an EF 17-40 f4 L. Other lenses that I would recommend over the 17-85mm would be the Tamron 28-75mm F2.8 and the Sigma 24-70mm F2.8."
2,Sharpness and Contrast are Weaknesses,"I was disappointed with the lens. Side-by-side comparisons of photos taken using the Canon 17-85mm and the Tamron 28-75mm 2.8 revealed that the Tamron is sharper and produces more contrasty images at 2.8 than the Canon at f5.6. With both lenses at f8 the Tamron again wins the sharpness and contrast prize. The photos were taken using the same Digital Rebel XT with all settings the same. I will say that image stabilization on the Canon is superior to my other two Canon IS lenses (the 28-135mm and the pricey 100-400mm). The Tamron, by the way, can be had for $370 right here at Amazon and there is currently a $40 rebate on that price."
1,Utter JUNK unsupported by Canon,"Bought 20 examples of this lens for a course I teach in Photography. Had problems from the first 6 months onward. 20/20 lenses either repeated Error 99 issues unresolved by cleaning contacts, dropped aperture blades, or constant hunting around for a focus point even in brightly lit scenes. .Contacted Canon and received no support other than to tell me that they are great lenses that they've had no problems with.... try a search for ""Canon 17-85mm problems"" the internet is littered with examples of the poor quality and NO support. Lens has been discontinued due to such poor construction.Shame on Canon for putting a 600 price tag on a faulty piece of equipment. I will not be buying another thing from them again based on the complete lack of customer service my school, my students and I received. As a photographer who loved the durability of my first Canon camera and lenses, this is greed at it's worst."
2,BAD chromatic aberration and vignetting,"Do not buy this product if you are serious about the quality of your pictures. This lens has the worst aberration and vignetting at 17mm. I spent a whole day taking pictures on a coast and the results were terrifying. My images had color noise, vignetting and were unsharp. So if you are going to shoot at the wide end a lot, this lens is not for you."
5,excellent!,"i ordered this lens cause its one of the ones i use at work and i love it. it is an excellent lens cause it is wider than the average 18 - 55 and it has more zoom. i just love the wide angle perspective it makes it so much better when taking a photo. for those who have a shakey hand it has the option to switch on the image stabilizer which obviously cannot replace a tripod but it does improve the photo when you are in low light situations. make sure you pay attention to what camera you are gonna use it for though as it only fits the rebel series, the 20D and 30D."
1,Hope I got a bad copy...,Just returned the 17-85 IS to Amazon after testing. 28mm WA detail very soft with significant CA - not nearly as good as the 18-55mm kit lens' performance. 45-128mm range not up to quality of the 28-135 IS lens I replaced this one with. Hoping next copy of this lens is much better or I made a big mistake selling my 28-135 IS...
3,Be forewarned about this Objetive,"Be forewarned, this objetive is quite flexible and acceptable results .. BUT .. it tends to fail with error 99. I have a Canon 30D and I use several other objectives (all Canon) and none have failed. This objective after 6 months of use began to show autofocus problems, ending with my camera freezes with error 99 .. After an investigation and several tests I found that the problem is the autofocus system, in fact I can use this with manual focus and works well .. Definitely, this lens has its weakness in its construction and / or design, since there are several people who have had the same drawback."
3,Overpriced,"This is a collection of papers on the subject of supply chain cost managment. Some of them are very useful and others are not. It is overpriced for the amount of useful infromation you are going to get. At $25 this would be a fair deal, at $70 it is priced like a college textbook."
3,Some slight pleasures,"These stories are generally interesting and readable, but there is a sense of being unfinished about them. Often they end too soon, or the endings feel like they're forcing an epiphany. The best story is also the longest, entitled ""Lower Crossing"" about an old dog. The longer form gives more of a chance for Hegi to weave together different elements into an affecting story. Some of the others, especially ""The End of All Sadness,"" which is the shortest, are not good. Hegi has some difficulty in getting into working class characters, which we see with this story, which also has an unfinished feel.Overall, the stories are worth reading, but this is definitely not her best work."
3,Not as good as previous books,"As a serious fan of Ursula Hegi, I was a bit disappointed in this book.This book is a collection of short stories that stand on their own, but only a couple had her usually great characterizations and observations. However, even those were a bit light from what I am used to from her as an author. Usually, her writing really clicks with me and this book did not to the extent I'm used to. Maybe it's me.This book seemed to me to be earlier work of a great writer and instead of the most current.After reading Stones from the River, Floating in my mother's palm, The vision of Emma Blau, Intrusions, Salt dancers and the collection of short stories in Unearned pleasures, I felt this book was not up to par with all the rest. I hope her next is better."
2,Much to generalistic,"Dissapointing and to generalistic. Some personal experience in the conducting of focus groups is described but, the book itself, is not worth what it costs."
5,A poignant tale of life on the Lower East Side of New York.,"I agree with the review from Aufbau magazine, which said: Out of Eldridge Street, by Rabbi Harold Swiss, teaches us the lesson that to be a good Jew it is necessary to not only study the Torah and Talmud and pray three times daily, but to practice that which we learn from the Torah and care about those around us, regardless of the color of their skins or their religion."
1,Directions are difficult to follow,"I've purchased this book and have found that the directions are not at all easy to follow. Details are left out, and diagrams are few and far between. I wouldn't recommend it."
1,Leaves much to be desired...,"I, like another reviewer, noticed many details and instructions missing. Diagrams provided were pretty worthless. Good photos of what a project might look like if you are an experienced sewer & can read between the lines of the written instructions for the missing details. Cannot recommend, leaves much to be desired."
5,Won't Snap!,"On a recent family vacation, our giant kite pulled my hundred-fifty pound father-in-law out to sea and the string didn't snap! I consider that a win. But I do miss my kite."
5,LOVE<3,"I love this show so much. I've been watching it since the first episode came out and I fell in love with it. The story line is great, the actors are great, everything is just great in the show and I recommend it to everyone."
4,Pretty little liars - pretty good!,I watched it with my teenaged daughter and we both enjoyed it. Content bothered me a little. 16 year old girls having sex and drinking alcohol? I used it as a chance to discuss life lessons with my daughter and we had good conversation and watched a very suspense filled show! We both enjoyed it very much.
5,totally entertaining,I gave this series a five star because I am really enjoying it. There are so many twists to the plot. Something new is always happeningThe acting is very good for all the characters. I already have recommended this series to ny relatives. I will continue to watch this series as long as it is on the air.
5,Addictive,Love this show. I blew through the first two seasons on Netflix and HAD to know what happened next! Totally addicted.
1,I tried to watch this show... D+,I am just not a fan of the show. I've tried to watch it several times and it's just kinda BLAH. Couldn't keep my attention.
5,"Sassy, Fun and Intriguing Series","This series is smart, sassy and has enough mystery to keep viewers of all ages interested in it for one reason or another. My kids and I enjoy watching this together. I am looking forward to more."
5,Gotta love the Liars!,This drama is fun and keeps you guessing. There have been many twists and turns in the past 3 seasons and I will continue watching to see what happens next.
5,Awesome!!,Love PLL! Love that I can catch the episode here if I miss it on tv & will have entire season & not have to wait for DVD to be released ;)
3,Pretty little liars third season,This set of pretty little liars did not play well it was fuzzy and slow buffered a lot I have had this problem with movies before.
4,GREAT Show,"I highly recommend this to any Pretty Little Liars Fan. It was worth the money I had to pay to get the episode I missed. The quality of the download was GREAT, and I was impressed that I was able to watch it on my computer, and then have it in my library to re-watch anytime I want."
5,Awesome,"I love it! I have two kids and most of the time, I can't get my shows on time. So by purchasing it on Amazon, I could watch it whenever I want and wherever I want... On my laptop, Kindle, etc. It's soo convenience!"
4,Great alternative,I really wanted to catch up on my show but could not find them any where for free so I was very happy to be able to purchase these episodes to get caught up on. they were easy to purchase and easy to watch.
3,Review,"This show would make a very interesting whodunit kind of thing..... I think intimate relationships could be left out.... because just the secrets and trying to figure out who is part of this group A is always enough to keep you watching with all the twists and turns. I personally could careless about the relationship part though, I don't think they are well written...."
4,missed TV episode,"great way to catch the missed TV episodes. especially, no comercials. can't wait for the new season to start. thank you."
2,Uhhhm hello?,"Hello?? where are the rest of the episodes? season 3 has 24 episodes not 13!!!?this says ""Complete Third Season"" this is not ""complete"""
5,Problem solved,This replacement part saved me a lot of trouble. The pump is obsolete. Without this impeller replacement I would have to buy a different pump and modify the connection to the outlet pipe. It was easy to install.
2,been sitting around awhile I think,smelled old.....I use it for my feet only.sure wish I could find the perfume....they should have never stopped making it
4,Choke and gang do it again... but...,"I love Star and Stripes. I got their first album by stealing it from a college radio station when I lived in Massachusetts back in the early 90's. I never knew Jack Kelly (aka Choke) and gang recorded another album until the guys from Flatfoot 56 told me. I immediately got it. Musically it is better than the first album. More anthemic in sound. My only negative would be; like the Shaved for Battle, it all seems tongue in cheek. Oh, well... great stuff anyways."
5,One of these books that open your mind,Every books that deals with malfunctioning of human mind is worth reading. Definetely this book is one of them. Very helpful to understand our mind or rather how our mind do not understand what is happening in the world.
2,"more unbearable than before, and now deluded","Taleb was unbearable in ""Fooled by Randomness."" Fooled was, however, worth the read. ""Swan"" is targeted to a general audience; in this attempt Taleb has lost his potentcy. But to greater effect, Taleb now seems deluded. For example, he tells a story of his past when as a tween he frightens the government of his home nation into granting him immunity from political offenses. Sad naive existence"
2,Some good ideas in a dreadful book,"Some thought-provoking ideas wrapped in an insufferably arrogant tone. Fortunately, there are plenty of other options for books that cover these topics. It just isn't worth wading through Taleb's straw man arguments and narcissistic preening. As alternatives, I'd suggest Mlodinow's ""The Drunkard's Walk"" or even Taleb's earlier ""Fooled by Randomness."""
4,"Interesting ideas, easy to follow","The idea of geometric probability distributions and their unpredictable effects on our lives is something which our linear intuition has problems grasping. This book makes it very clear that the future cannot be expected to be like the past when we are dealing with phenomena (earthquakes, asteroid strikes, stock market crashes, etc.) which occur according to geometric probability distributions. The author points out that we tend to assume incorrectly that all random phenomena are distributed according to the Normal (bell shaped curve) distribution. The book is a bit thin in terms of what the implications for optimal human behavior are for all this, but it is an interesting, well-thought out and explained thesis."
4,Worth reading,"Very interesting subject and worth reading, although the not especially well written and the author gets arrogant and annoying at times."
5,Very basic set of filters,"This is about as basic a set as you can get. I think I first used these about 60 years ago. But in this case, clasic is good. You can, after the fact, get some of the same effects in Photoshop but it's nicer to see the results in real time before you shoot. (Note these really only work for black and white - in color they are pretty ugly.)"
4,"Fun, Electric Soundtrack","Simply if you like Jpop, Techno, or even Jazz this is for you; this isn't just for anime fans.Thanks to Yuki Kajiura's superb blend of techno, orchestral, and regional sounds, you will find yourself transported into the world of great composer ability, such as herself. She also offers her pretty vocals."
3,haunting novel,"the book starts out slow, and could be better. but as the story moves on, you are swept along with the main character. the overall atmosphere of the novel for me was rather dark and sorrowful, but with a sliver of hope running through. i liked the novel well enough, but the despair driven atmosphere didn't agree with me."
5,Haunting,"I have just found this book after searching 30 years (thank you, Amazon!). I read it as a mid-teen and was deeply touched -- even haunted by it. A horrendously tortured Stephen is left semi-conscious in the dungeon of his father's house after many severe beatings. His mind and spirit wander to create a vision cast forward in time reaching out in desperation to two modern-day brothers. Even through and maybe because of his agony, he tells of his life, his people, the kingdom he should inherit, and the brutality of his father. The captivated brothers share his despair, his hope, his fears, and even the very real pain of Stephen's continuing torture. The book has a heart-stopping redemptive ending that has left me haunted by my own ""Vision of Stephen"" for all these years."
1,Not worth the money,"I loved this scent and it isn't sold anywhere, so I was happy when I saw that is was on Amazon. I try to never write bad reviews but I can't hold back. For one it took FOREVER to get it and I had to send emails to inquire about what was taking so long, they said that it was out of stock and that they would send an email when it was back in. When I placed the order there were plenty available, so I don't know why mine wasn't held upon my card being charged and the order placed. Second it smells like baby lotion and was poorly packaged, not at all the scent that is is supposed to be. I guess it is not sold in the mall for a reason, its not made anymore! Don't waste your time or money."
5,A great Sci-Fi book!,"I am consummate reader of romance books and tend not to read any other genre. However, after reading ""The Blackest Heart"" I am now a fan of Sci-Fi especially books written by Vince Churchill. This book is a cross between Mad Max and Star Wars. After being savagely beaten and left for dead, retired marshal Thane Bishop rises like Lazarus to seek revenge on Yardon Wrath who traumatized his wife and kidnapped his daughter.Mutant animals, rage, government experiments gone wrong, hate, revenge and yes there is even love in this book. Totally captivating, page-turner, hard-to-put down book! What more could you want in a good book? Perhaps, a good film! This book would make an excellent movie."
4,Great book,"Absorbing, great character development, good story, shocker ending. What more could you ask for?!"
4,It gets better and better,"Even though this is not my usual genre of reading material, I liked Mr.Churchill's first book so much that I just had to read this one. I was NOT disappointed. In fact...I was quite pleasantly surprised. Very captivating, and energetic...always something happening.And the ending...WHOA!a great read...especially if you like the gruesome!I can't wait for his next endeavor!"
5,"""Add to the Legend!""","Yeeeeee-hah! A pulpy sci-fi/western barn burner with more iconic characters than you can shake a stick at, oodles of perverse humor, and an almost non-stop blast of double-barreled action. Not for the faint of heart-- Churchill doesn't skimp on the sex and violence-- but this reader sure thought it was a lot of fun. Gunslinging lawman of the future Thane Bishop returns from the dead to avenge his death and save his daughter from a menagerie of imaginative creatures. Set-pieces are frequent and terrific, hardboiled description evocative throughout. Lots of clever references for those who are game. Very enjoyable."
4,Great Addition,Nikon D60 10.2MP Digital SLR Camera with 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G AF-S DX VR and 55-200mm f/4-5.6G ED IF AF-S DX VR Zoom-Nikkor Lens with 2 Nikon School DVDsThis battery functions the same as the OEM battery. I purchased it rather than a knock off since I really didnt want to take a chance and ruin my expensive new camera.I get over 500 shots with the flash on a full charge.4 stars because I wish it was a little less expensive!
1,not satisfied,"Spent the extra cash for a Nikon branded battery, and it failed to hold a charge after two or maybe three recharges. Should have gone for the more powerful generic."
4,A Fine Battery,"This works fine, charges quickly and holds its' charge to allow you to take several hundred photos (phew!). Only real grumble is the price, but given it's made by Nikon (which means it'll be reliable), what do you expect?"
3,Not a genuine Nikon battery,"From the pictures in the listing and the description I expected a genuine Nikon battery. I compared it to the Nikon web site ""identifying counterfeit battery"" and found that it is not real Nikon. The battery works well but counterfeits do not usually last very well. Search ""Nikon counterfeit battery"" for more information. The battery appears to be good quality but it would be more honest to state ""High Quality replacement battery"" Not ""Nikon Battery"""
1,2 of 2 Genuine Nikon EN EL9 batteries arrive DOA,"I bougth a brand battery from Energier and it was DOA. I elected to buy the genuine, Nikon. So far I am 0/2. The reseller promptly shipped me a replacement and that to is DOA. Urggg. My current battery and charger work fine. I need a back up battery.Anyone else seeing this level of DOA rate on genuine Nikon batteries?"
4,"Good, but only 250 pictures","The battery seems to last about 250 pictures with heavy use of the LCD, flash and VR. When used with the SB400 external flash the battery lasts much longer."
1,Junk,"Battery lasted 2 recharges. After that, will not hold a charge, nor even register on charger at all. Total junk and waste of money. Too late to return for refund/replacement as item fault was found outside 30 day return policy window."
5,What I Expected,This OEM was what I wanted for my Nikon. The price was the best I could find and it has met my expectations.
3,Bad battery?,"This is probably a complete fluke.I fully charged the battery as instructed. It lasted one week and 102 pictures. I know these Lithium Ion batteries are supposed to ""keep on running"" (okay, different brand), but I'll bet they usually last a bit longer than that.I'm going to give it another shot, so to speak."
2,Slooow Delivery,This is a battery. I assume it works. I bought it to have an extra battery in Europe on a recent trip. I took the slow delivery and it was so slow the battery came after I left. It was even slower than the outside date promised. I figure Amazon just sits on the order so that it will not go out and the free delivery means you're going to have to wait until the outside date or beyond. I used to get it at an earlier date but maybe Amazon is discouraging buyers to use the free delivery. Who knows.
3,MRS,Ok I couldn't find a way to contact you so...I think giving a shipping range of July 6 to July 21 is lame. It was be nice if you could get it to me before July 7 cuz thats when I need it. If not I'll cancel my order.ThanksMary
5,Keep charge a long time,"These batteries are must better than the generic brands. They stay charged a LOT longer, probably more than twice as pictures can be taken on the Nikon batteries. I have tried some of the generic brands and they just are not as good. I will continue to buy only the Nikon brand in the future."
5,Nikon Battery,"Arrived in the time frame as said , works well and was a life saver on holiday. Would use this company again."
4,The only backup battery I would buy,"I use this in my Nikon D60. The only reason I didn't give this battery 5 stars is that it is a bit pricey. Having said that however, I wouldn't buy any other battery for something as important as my digital camera. I've tried knock-offs before and have been very disapointed. This official Nikon battery however has not disappointed at all. It has a very good life and I never worry in a critial situation."
1,Misrepresented Product,Product description and photo indicates that this product is a 'Nikon' battery. I received a knock-off battery made in China.
3,BUY THE NIKON BAG KIT INSTEAD,"If you are looking for a spare battery for your D40, I recommend you purchase the Nikon accessory kit instead (comes with a great Nikon camera bag, spare battery identical to this one and a photo guide). It barely costs more than this battery alone and you will get the bag for almost nothing."
1,counterfeit?,"the batteries barely held a charge. One to three photos per charge. Took to an authorized Nokon repair center. They checked my camera, charger, and the batteries. I was told that these were extremely close counterfeits."
1,knockoff,"if you are buying from ""michael p,"" reconsider. it is not a genuine product. mine stopped working after about 3 months (and never really kept a charge very long before that.) But I ordered a real one from an authorized dealer and it looks totally different. (look for four tiny notches on hologram and ""nikon corporation, japan,"" printed on the bottom. These are on the genuine battery, but not the fake one."
1,Won't hold charge,"Transaction was great. Quick response but apparently an inferior product. Bought this as a secondary battery for my D40 so I would never be without power. Worked fine for awhile but then stopped accepting a charge. I specifically chose the Nikon battery rather than a cheap imitation because I just don't trust after market substitutes. Well, how is it that this item stopped working after just months of use. My original battery which I have had since the camera was purchased nearly 5 years ago works just fine. Where is the longevity of the second battery? Certainly not here. Let's just say I am beyond disappointed and want restitution. Maybe I'll have to look for a 5-year old battery for satisfaction."
1,Did not hold a charge!,Don't buy this battery! The battery held a charge for 1 hour! The battery store that I took it to said that it must be very old and did not appear to be an actual Nikon battery.
1,COUNTERFEIT Nikon Battery.,"Got the battery and it turned out to be COUNTERFEIT!!! Since ALL of my Nikon batteries are gray I was suspicious immediately. I went to nikons site and sure enough it was exactly like they said was counterfeit. I contacted the dealer and he said he gets them for the same supplier as I told him just send me a real one. I decided to just keep it BUT I WILL NEVER DEAL WITH THESE GUYS AGAIN. The old adage "" YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR"". If a counterfeit battery is what you want I would buy for them for sure if a real one is what you want then pay the $50 bucks. I can't say how well the fake battery works yet since I got discouraged when I got it and I was running near the end of my project so I just stuck with my old ""real"" one. I must say the guy offered to return the product but I figured it was to much crap to go through for $20. I will just go to Best Buy when I need a Nikon Battery next time."
2,It is not worth it.,This case is not what you can expect for an item priced like this.The lether material becomes damaged after certain time of use.Because of It's design it is also difficult to handle the phone once you manage how to insert it in it.
5,Memorable for a reason!,"Back in the 80's, I read a lot of Loveswepts, and liked them much better than Harlequin Romances. I found them to be truly as their tagline described as ""Love stories you'll never forget, by authors you'll always remember."" I had my favorites, and to this day remember most of them. This book, ""Lightning That Lingers"" still stands as far and away the best of the lot. It was the sweetest love story I've ever read, and featured a couple I could relate to and root for. I was thrilled to find it for the Kindle. The mark of a good story is it's timelessness, and this one wears its age lightly. It wasn't that hard to return to an 80's mindset, in fact I found it refreshing. It is rather short, compared to others in the line, but that is due to the gifted team of Sharon and Tome Curtis. Not one word is wasted, and each one is evocative and weaves its magic. Looking forward to revisiting other favorites!"
5,No more bruises,"These work great and you can put them on and take them off rather quickly. They instantly wrap around your arm - the velcro strap is there, but it really isn't needed. I expected these to be very hard, but they aren't. They are just hard enough to keep you from getting bruised.My only negative is that they get really warm, really quick. I will use them for the exercises that require them, but then remove them."
4,great kettlebell forearm guards,I bought these to use with a 25lb kettlebell so I could have better wrist support and form. They work really well. I did not know that you slap this to your wrists (haha as I was trying to figure out to put them on) like some of those old slap bracelets. They work great. I'm not sure how heavy of a kettlebell these will support but 25lb seems to be just fine.
5,Hi LENZIE!!,Of course I will be your friend!Do you have an account?LGP3LNCEVERYTHING LUVERFOREVERIN ALL ETERNITYROCK SQUARED
5,Recommended light cozy,"I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the quirky LA characters. It's definitely not a ""whodunit"" but rather a nice murder mystery adventure."
1,frustratingly poor writing,"While the plot may be semi-interesting, the writing is AWEFUL. This book lacks creativity or any semblance of linguistic talent. I felt like I was reading something written for the pre-teen age bracket, not for adults. Add to that a lack of basic vocab skills (the misuse of words makes me think it wasn't even edited) and it's actually painful to read. I couldn't even finish it."
5,Kozy Fun!,"I love cozy mysteries and am always thrilled to find a new series and this is one of the best new series I've come across in a long time. Kitty Karlyle is a great pet chef protagonist and I love her relationships with her clients, their pets and her erstwhile boyfriend, Jack, who is a detective on the LAPD. And I like the way the author has combined the mystery with cooking and pets. If you are a mystery lover and/or a pet and cooking lover, you should give this book a try!"
1,this is how I try NOT to write,"If this was written by a 12 year old it might deserve all the accolades, but I think it's an insult to young teens to suggest it's written at their level. All the young teen/young adult readers I know would get tired of this writing. It's banal.Sure the set up is interesting, and it's why I finished the book. But truly, the use of words is sometimes incorrect, the attempt at puns is awful, the development of the characters is weak, and the main character is not emotionally attractive. Plot? Even though I like a nice surprise at the end, it should be a twist that seems logical to all the previous plot development! This ending was not.And really, the word FANG is not a pleasant word, and should never be used so often without any meaning. Take a class on alliteration and how language sounds."
1,Not bad but could be worse,"The only thing worse that buying this voilin here for this price is to pay twice as much for this same violin at a ""Music"" store....be careful....this is a good deal for what you get and its not much."
1,Save your money.,"The buzz about ""VSOs"" (violin-shaped objects) is true. This thing was literally impossible to tune. I'm not saying that after tuning it would then go flat after a little while. That I could deal with. The strings refused to hold a note, AT ALL, even after the guy at the music store put some stuff on the pegs. I would tune one string and by the time I had done the next, the first was off again. and I mean, like the A string would go down to a D within 2 minutes. It was completely unplayable.If you want to learn to play but don't have loads of cash, rent a decent instrument from a music store. You'll save yourself a lot of frustration."
5,retort to teacher,I am also a violin teacher and recomment these instruments to my begginning students as it is cheaper than renting and with a little care they go a long way. 3 of my students performed in the NYSSMA competition with these instruments all recieving the highest mark and praise fro the tone of their instruemnt.
1,This Violin Makes My Stomach Hurt,"This violin sounds so horrible! There's a reason why they call this a student violin. That's because even the greatest violinist would sound like a student with this. No matter how good you are, you will sound terrible. This violin produces a horribly flat sound. It is tough to tell whether you are in tune or not (Because it always sounds bad). While it is cheap, it is definitely very bad for a student. It will discourage them (Sounds horrible), teaches bad tune (Difficult to compare to other's tune), and requires frequent tuning.It may be more expensive, but please just rent a decent violin. You will save a lot of trouble. Also, many stores offer a discount when you rent from them. That will come in handy if you become a serious player and require a great violin.Save yourself some trouble, time, and money by renting a decent violin."
3,Okay treatment,"If you want a book that provide a survey on the topic, this book will serve the purpose as an intro. But the codes are not that reliable. While the authors do provide codes to implement concepts discussed, some of the codes does not even compiled. For those that compiled some of it does not tackle the problem that it should tackle. Further editing and rewriting required."
4,LUMINOUS INDEED,"NOT A BAD WAY TO SPEND TIME WITH A LOVED ONE. LOVE THE LIGHT SHOW ,LIKED THE MUSIC TOO.Nice to see something not all hyped up.like all things, kick back and enjoy the show, let it flow."
1,Junk,"For something like this to work, it must be the highest quality image, full screen, and interesting to look at. This was just junk. I work in video, was trained in video arts when I went to art school, and can tell you that this video is without creativity, without imagination, and it is certainly bad art. I'm sorry, but I thought this was real junk. Awful quality. Looks ugly on my Imac screen. I would never have this playing in the background at a get-together in my home, which is what I intended for when I bought this thing Very disappointing. If you can find a video called ""By Design"" by a company called Colorcalm, you will see what a collection of great video artists are capable of doing. This video has a series of gorgeous and subtle video 'chapters', each one like a beautiful moving abstract painting. I've wanted to buy this for all my friends, but I can't seem to find even one other copy. Meanwhile, save your money on this video. I watched this for 5 minutes, and just through it out."
2,Overpriced and kind of dull.,"Endless depictions of (albeit colorful) sea, sky and smokey clouds. The soundtrack is that same droning angelic ""New Age"" drivel that tries to pass itself off as music. Did not put me in a meditative state. Didn't get my Chi moving either. Boooooring. Next."
5,Validator validates,This was an early Christmas gift that I gave early due to using it for my boyfriends' business...he loves it and all works well and easy with it...this makes his job a little bit easler
3,Nice,Arrived as expected. The sounds do help but these sounds can also be home recorded to save money. Overall nice product and great idea from the author.
1,No fade in on songs,"I wanted to use this CD to help block out noises from the house while my baby sleeps. This CD did not work at all for me because the tracks don't fade in at the beginning. The tracks do fade out at the end, but then they start up with a bang when they repeat, which always woke up by baby. I ended up buying a sound machine by Homedics instead."
1,Slightly silly,"I'm a fan of Dr. Karp's The Happiest Baby book and DVD. However this CD is a bit silly. It contains three tracks which are all the same, just different speeds.While the 5 S's mentioned in the Happiest Baby book do work extremely well, the recordings on this CD do nothing to help them. Instead I'd suggest making a recording of your own of the dishwasher or dryer.(Update: I did three recordings of the dishwasher on my laptop. I play them in a loop in Media Player. They work like a charm pretty consistently when done with swaddling)"
5,parenting advice,Please see my review of the Happiest Toddler on the Block. I included the review of the Happiest Baby in that one.
1,Happiest Baby,"This CD was not ""great"". The sounds that were on it didn't last long and jumped from one to the next. It would have been better if each track was longer. This was a gift to my daughter and her new baby and she said she hoped I hadn't paid a lot for it."
1,Didn't work for my little one,"After reading all the reviews and deciding to purchase this item, I was hoping that this CD would have worked. Not only does it not work with my little one but she cries harder and louder. I was incredibly disappointed and wish that I didn't waste the money. Hope that it ends up working for your baby; it definitey didn't work for mine."
2,this didn't work for me,"I'm actually returning this CD. Maybe I waited too long past the actual newborn phase, but my husband thought it was scary and my baby didn't seem to enjoy this at all."
5,It's a life saver for first time Mom's!!!,I watched this video twice! Once by myself and once with my husband. I wish I had purchased this video right after my daughter was born! Would have saved us for hours of crying!! She sleeps longer now and cries a lot less!! We are all very happy with the results! I recommend the video to all New Moms!!
2,No shushing??,Bought this disc thinking it might be nice to have the choice to just play a shushing sound instead of having to do myself. But it's oddly absent. Considering it's the one sound the book and video say is crucial what was the thought process there?
3,Just okay!,"The book, ""The Happiest Baby,"" leads you to believe that the CD is ""white noise"" that will soothe your baby, stop the crying and lull them to sleep and keep them asleep. The CDs first track stops your baby from crying but the heart beat track 2 and 3 does little to lull your baby to sleep and keep them asleep. I found that paying the rush next day delivery to be an absolute waste of money! I was desperate to get my 6 week old to sleep more than 30 minutes and rushed to get the CD. I found that static from a radio does wonders for ""white noise"" and keeps my baby asleep all night!"
2,Just google it and save yourself some money,"First, I acciently bought the DVD instead of the book, but every single baby book I've read has the same information. The 5 S's of how to calm a baby. It's not a secret. The audio and picture is terrible. What a waste of money."
3,Should have itunes it,The only sound/song we used on this CD was the fast and vigorus and even at that we only needed it for the first month and a half. After that she actually would get upset every time we played any of the CD. Every baby is different so i am passing it along but for my baby not the best purchace. Definitly worth a try though!
5,WOW!,What a miracle the Happiest Baby CD is! My husband and I are taking care of our 5 month old granddaughter and have found it to be a perfect solution to those fussy times. She is immediately calmed by the sounds on the CD and asleep in her swing within 5 minutes of turning it on. Where was this when we were raising our our kids! Thank you for a wonderful product!AMiller
3,Didn't work in our case,"The cd is fine, plays for a long time and no problems.Although Dr. Karp seems to believe it will calm babies, in our particular case, our little boy gave it a wailing ""thumbs down"".Perhaps if we had utilized it sooner, it would have helped us all get through the ""belly devils"" of colic.I would not recommend against it, your baby is different from ours, obviously."
1,"Book was great, cd not so much.","Useless, crappy sounds. Nothing soothing about it. Downloaded a soother from itunes and its much better. The book however was awesome."
4,Great help at home and in the car,"Started using this when my baby was about 5 weeks old. Very helpful. I gave it four stars because there is one track, I believe 4, that startles him and wakes him every time it starts."
4,"Great Show, Price Could Be Better","Other sites have this series listed for cheaper, so beware of that. Unfortunately I was purchasing this for a gift and had to buy it from Amazon for a steeper price.This is a great show that I will never get bored if watching. Amazing show, no damage to packaging that I've noticed yet. I do miss the play all option on the first few seasons."
2,Not bad.,"There is no ENGLISH subtitle in season 1-5. The amazon sold an old dvd, of this series.English subtitle only season 6-7. I need the subtitle, because my hearing not good."
5,Fascinating letdown,"I had read Collier's earlier narrative works, JUST THE FACTS and PORTRAITS FROM LIFE. They are wonderful collections of visual essays.I was looking forward to reading THE HAMILTON SKETCHBOOKS as well. I was surprised. This was exactly what it said it was. A sketchbook. And, although the art is endearlingly clumsy and I laughed for days over one of the pictures, I was a little disappointed that he did not return to the essay form.It seems, with the publishing of the follow up to this book, THE FRANK RITZA PAPERS, a combination of one essay and another series of sketches, that Collier is at a crossroads. He seems to have become more fascinated with the anecdotal story and less with the narrative. Which is a nice thing, both books still have his reserved self-effacing Canadian sensibility, but all the same, he is so good at the narrative that I hope he returns to it.Regardless, I am looking forward to his next Drawn & Quarterly publication, whatever it might be."
5,Indie Film Minute,"We produce a radio feature [...] that recommends great indie, documentary, and foreign films to rent. Toward this end, we are always looking for recommendations to watch and review. This book had several references that lead to ideas for our feautre. It is exceptionally literate, well researched and written. a hearty recommendation for one of our favorite film history books."
4,"Great lens, but be ready to buy an external flash for indoor use!","This lens takes fantastic pictures, but I recommend you don't purchase this lens unless you're also ready to purchase an external flash. When this lens is used in the 10mm-17mm focal length and the camera's built-in flash is used, the flash will cast a shadow on the picture resulting in severe light fall off at the bottom of the photo. You will need an external flash and bounce the light for effective indoor photos. If used without a flash or at greater than 17mm focal lengths you should have no problems at all. The quality of the lens is excellent and the focus is fast!"
4,"For what I do, this is the best lens","Great feel, solid and professional but weight is a lttle more than I expected. Focus and zoom have a smooth action. Photographically, I love the wide angle results. Great for HDR."
5,Amazing UWA Lens,"This is really an amazing lens for a canon crop camera. I purchased to fill out my wide angle options on my 40D, as I also have the Canon 24-105mm. Great image quality, auto focus, and construction, just as all the reviews say. It does take some practice to use the ultra wide range of this lens effectively, but the longer range gives great results right away."
5,Nice Item,"About the only thing I would warn people about is that at the extreme wide angle setting, the lens casts a noticeable shadow when using the built-in flash."
4,Canon EF-S 10-22 mm Wide angle zoom,"After reviewing all the lens choices available in the 10-20mm range I choose Canon's 10-22mm. I am pleased with the new lens performance.The construction is sturdy, distortion is low compared for the 10mm end compared with other lenses. The images are very sharp if the camera is tripod mounted. I shoot hand held most often and most of the images are very sharp as long as I pay attention to not allow shutter speeds below about 1/50 sec.I do miss the IS quite a bit.. like that on my Canon 18-55 kit lens.And I do feel that for a lens this expensive ($650+) Canon should provide a lens hood.Overall I'm very satisfied with my purchase"
4,WOW!,"This is a VERY cool lens for non traditional photos. I am a Realtor.I use it primarily for shooting interior shots of homes that I am selling, and showing to buyers. Now, outside of the work place, I love this lens for shooting many unconventional photos. The clarity is superb. I use it on both my 40D and XSI. I shoot a great deal of sports photos and you can take an entire gym for some shots of basketball, just for starters. Feels and produced the quality of my ""L"" primes. Love this lens. Enjoy!"
4,Good wide angle lens for Canon 1.6x FOVCF cameras,"I have owned this lens for just over a year. While it is not my most used lens, it does get some action. The images from my copy are quite sharp, have good color and contrast. The image quality is on par with all of my L lenses, but the build is not. The lens is very lightweight and small. I find that I use this lens from about 14-22 most often as the distortion between 10-14 is too much for me to handle. I use this lens mostly for landscape, interiors and environmental portraits.I would recommend this lens to anyone sticking to Canon's 1.6x camera bodies who needs something extra wide. If you are planning on adding or going FF (and distortion is your archenemy), I would suggest getting the 17-40L. It is comparable in price and is compatible with FF cameras."
5,must-have lens for crop sensor,"Recently went on vacation. I had just purchased this lens and also rented a 24-105 L lens. I used this one far more often than the 24-105. It's a true wide angle for a crop sensor, and was the only lens that could get the entire shot in 80% of the pictures I took."
4,Best lens you can add to your bag - short of an L lens,"The Canon EF-S 10-22mm f/3.5-4.5 USM wide angle zoom is a fantastic lens in build construction and image quality. The only limiting factor is the maximum aperture of 3.5, but otherwise this is a lens I am extremely glad to have at my side. Solid build with an ideal wide zoom range, the lens performs well for landscapes, architectural shoots, and for ""special effects"".Perhaps somewhat of a gamble as the EF-S format is limited to compact sensor/short back focus cameras (those cameras with APS-C sized sensors released after 2003), but I do think they will be around for a while longer."
4,"Good product, but not very solid","I had a chance to compare it with a Tokina glass. Canon is better on a contrast and better on a distortion, same or even slightly worse on a sharpness, and complete looser on a build quality.If you are ok with 12mm - get Tokina."
5,My funnest lens,"This lens was recommended to me by a photographer whose talents I admire greatly. Sure, it cost a lot, but it is still cheaper than a lot of other lenses I want. My arsenal includes some very highly rated lenses, but this one is the one I enjoy most when wanting another perspective on a subject or scene.In simple layman's terms, the lens gives me everything I expected and more. Sharp, clean wide angle shots. It hasn't let me down yet and I have no regrets that I bought it."
4,Good lens,"Clear crisp pictures, excellent zoom that still incorporates the entire scene.Good for close up shots as well, but you have to get really close to your subject.A bit pricey, but still an excellent addition to your lens arsenal."
5,Best Wide Angle for Canon cropped sensor,"This lens is a great option for any Canon owner of a 7d and below. The build quality may not be ""L"" standards, but picture quality is outstanding! I use this lens for large group shots, indoor shooting, street shooting, and anything/everything to create that ""WIDE"" look. If you are looking for a wide angle for your bag, this is your best option. I owned the Tokina 11-16...this one is superior and has a further reach...the extra money for this Canon 10-22 was worth it."
3,"Not bad, but no other options","If you have a 1.6x cropped sensor, then this is really the only super wide angle lens canon makes. The crop factor makes this equivalent to a 16-35mm lens on a full sensor. The construction quality feels solid and well built. That said, this is not an ""L"" lens. I'm not an ""L"" snob ... I'll take a value where ever I can get it. The sharpness on this lens is pretty good, but not razor sharp. Even on a tripod, even at F/8 or F/11, even with MLU, it's acceptably sharp, but not amazingly sharp. Even so, I love using this lens because the wide angle creates some great composures. The other place this lens falls short is contrast. Once again, acceptable but not amazing. This is a good lens, but not a great one."
5,Great lens!,Just as I expected. Outstanding Canon quality as always. Amazon service is always terrific!
5,Awesome Entry Level Wide-Angle,"I bought this lens to go with my T4i so I could take it to Glacier NP this past summer. It is a wonderful lens that turns out great photos. It is light and sturdy which makes it very nice to hike around with. More so than my other lenses, I really feel like I'm back in Glacier when I look at the photos I've taken with this one. The wide angle makes is more immersive."
5,Awesome Lens,"Excellent Lens...used it on a 7d before selling it and thus this lens also. Now use a 16-35L on a full frame camera. The 10-22 was a fantastic lens...zero complaints. That said, consider using a thin filter as 10mm on a 1.6 will see a regular size filter...or at least it did on mine. Aside from that I had no issues...great lens, great value for the quality."
5,West Ham Till I Die,"If you are then this is for you. With some amazing songs that will make you laugh and join in. Over land and sea, join in with the claps. Booy Moore was inocent and Billy Bonds M.B.E. which sounds like it has been done by onu sound system. It has the clasics as well including I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles. It has dance, techno and punk styles.Come On you Irons"
2,Buy more than one,"Although the gate has two places that needs to be secured to the banister, the kit only comes with 1 piece so make sure you order 2. It would seem logical that it would come with 2 but I digress. Once both piece came they do the job fairly well."
1,Very disappointing,"I purchased this book with the hope of getting the native american viewpoint on the subject, and hopefully a different perspective. Instead, the author just restates creationist arguments about evolution, and restates scientific arguments about creationism, and he does not do a good job with either. He seems to think that cherry picking phrases from quotes is all that is needed to prove his points. Most disappointing was the tiny amount of space devoted to native american thoughts on this issue."
1,Just Plain Silly,"Vine Deloria has done brilliant work in the past. It's sad to see him dilute his legacy with silliness like this. The lack of intellectual rigor that underlies his superficial (mis)understanding of the theory of evolution is shocking to anyone who has read his previous work. He simply hasn't sat down, rolled up his sleeves, and done the groundwork necessary to take on a project of this nature."
4,Nice album!,"Great album but had more older songs than I would have thought, like a cover of Take me Home Country Road by John Denver. Still a good album but thought they had some newer material on it."
2,"well-written, very disappointing ending","I was really getting into this book. It was funny and the characters were well-written. But the ending was a bucket of cold water. Yeah, it was surprising, but not in a good way. I don't agree with the reviewer who said there was too much sex. There was almost no sex, and when it was finally time for the sex to happent, it gave me the willies to think of it. In my opinion, the author made the wrong choice. Which makes it one of those relationships that was exciting and fun while it lasted, but ended so badly it's hard to remember all the good times."
2,Sorely disappointed,"We read this for book club and not one of us thought it deserved more than an OK grade. I love a good, light read as much as anyone but this book was not well-written and disappointing to say the least. A frequent complaint from our group was the lack of development of any characters. But my biggest gripe was the ending. (warning spoiler!) After thinking that the guy she ends up with (Marucci) is some kind of sleazy womanizer for the entire book and then, in an instant, she ends up with him - was too much. We all thought the addition of book club questions at the end of the book was the height of indulgence by the writer. It's not a book club type book - it's a beach, throwaway chick-lit book."
2,Oh... My... Gosh...,"Amazing book- I couldn't put it down... until the last three chapters.Let's just say, the book twisted in the worst ways and left me cracking up by how awful the outcome was. I truly think the writer, an otherwise very talented woman, got bored and had to throw in a few random twists.Sorely disappointed! What was she thinking??"
4,Great premise! Fun read!!,"I can't wait to get together with my book club friends and start crafting our lists. But then, should I act on my list or one of their lists???? What a great concept of completing someone's list in the spirit in which is was written. The characters are colorful, the insights are priceless (anyone who has ever been overweight knows how hard it is to eat something yummy in public!!), and the ending is lovely. Perfect summer book! Great for a book club discussion!!"
2,Cute little book up untill the end,"This is a cute story and an easy read. I did find it a little hard to get into the story and it took me quite a while to even like our main character June. Just when I felt like the story line was picking up it simply ends and everything you were set up for just stops. No explanation, but the story takes on a new twist and it's over. It is a great concept, but unfortunately this book just didn't deliver."
3,Book,"Entertaining and funny. A good read. June life changes when the passenger in her car dies. Out of guilt, she decides to complete the things to do before I'm 25 on the passengers to do list."
4,Book Club Picks,"Even though this wasn't one of my favorites (I'm not a big chick lit fan), it was still a good read, if you're looking for something quick and uplifting. It inspired a great discussion in our book club as we discussed the items we would include on our list of things to do before we die. We emailed the author and scheduled a conference call with her during our book club meeting. This part was awesome, because we were able to ask her questions, such as what inspired her to write the book or to create certain characters. Jill Smolinsky is a smart and nice lady.I would recommend this book to those who enjoy chick lit."
5,Thought provoking,"What a great book! I couldn't put it down. It was a sweet, well-writen book. It really made me think, and I identified with June. Thanks to the author who was very creative and wrote this book."
5,Best book ever!,"This is my new favorite book. I loved it! June's story and journey of self discovery is inspirational and admirational. I wasn't able to put this book down wondering what adventure June was going to encounter next. No matter where I left off this book left me in a happy mood. This book shares a great message that even one act of kindness, no matter how small it may seem, can change someone's life."
4,"Wonderful book, disappointing ending","I loved this book! I read it in two days. It would have been one, but I had to work. I couldn't put it down. I was highly disappointed with one aspect of the ending however. Once the love interest has been built up it changes with no warning. AAAAHHHH! I was sooooooo disappointed. Other than that I loved it. I'm going to make my own list."
3,Lacking in emotion.,"I expected to love this book, as I really enjoyed the premise -- after the accidental death of a near-stranger, June holds herself responsible for completing the woman's life ""to do"" list. Along the way, she rediscovers her own passions and purpose -- and, of course, romance.But something was missing. While I know we were supposed to sense June's disconnect from her own life, I never got the feeling that she was at all invested in anything -- even at the end of the book. The distance between herself and the events of her life left me feeling disconnected as well, and I never recovered."
3,The Next Thing on my List,This book was a very enjoyable easy read. The plot was very well developed. Wish the characters had a bit more development as well. I think it had a very good and interesting premise. The author did a good job with it.
4,Goo escape,"Interesting storyline, would be a great beach read. A pay it forward type novel. Pretty light yet touches on a number of subjects."
2,Simplistic,"This book is less than a beach read - it is a no brainer. The plot is thin and the ""twists"" are seen for pages before. It would make a nice Lifetime movie, if you like that sort of production."
2,"2 1/2 Stars... It's okay, but the ending falls flat","I thought the book was charming and sweet, but I never really connected with June. I think the grief should have been much heavier in almost all of these characters who have lost a loved one, and even in June, who contributed (although accidentally) to Marissa's death. June's journey never quite seems like her own (which seemed to me the point of the book), but instead it seems like a quest that she never really embraces fully.**POTENTIAL SPOILER**The ""love interests"" in this book also don't seem to make a lot of sense, and in the end, I was left confused by June's actions. Smolinski never quite explains what leads June to have a change of heart.All in all, the book is an easy read, and if the ending wasn't so disappointing, I would have given it closer to 4 stars."
5,Great read!!,"This was a very good book. I finished it in a week. The story line was very well written, making you not want to put it down. The ending will both surprise you and make you feel good at the same time. I look forward to reading more of this authors work!!"
3,the next thing on my list,"I loved the premise of this book, and enjoyed the sense of humor involved. I felt the main character evolved as a person as a result of certain events, however was hoping to be a bit more inspired. I chose this as our November book for our book club and everyone seems to have enjoyed it,4 out of 7 have finished it and said they had several LOL moments. So if you want an easy read thats entertaining I'd suggest this book."
4,Virgin Chick Lit reader enjoyed this book!,"I have not gone through and read all the reviews, but I did read the 2-star and 3-star reviews. First of all, I devour true crime books and non-fiction (like John Krakauer, as an example). So I saw this book and the great reviews and thought I could stand to do a little lighter reading, so I bought it. What a pleasant surprise! I really enjoyed this book--a lot. I read it quickly and just at the halfway mark, I knew I'd be sad when I was done with the book. While it did take a couple unexpected (and disappointing) turns near the end, it was entertaining and the plot was original. I appreciated the author's effort at making this realistic and not tying it up into a neat, tidy, predictable little bow. I do understand some of the 3-star reviews, while I don't want to spoil anything for future readers. I am definitely going to read the author's other book now."
4,Interesting premise and a sweet story...,"What a surprising read! I picked it up because I thought the premise sounded interesting, but I devoured this book in less than 24 hours. What a great little book. A heartwarming and touching tale. A bit (with the baby stuff) was a bit over the top for me, but it was still a great piece of fiction. This would be great for reading while at the pool! Really good!"
2,Easy read,"The book was contrived and formulaic, but an easy read. Only recommended if you have time to kill and really don't want to think."
2,I tried!,"I decided to read this book based on the good reviews. But I just couldn't get into the book, stopped reading after couple of pages."
3,Good Plot,Story Plot Excellent. There was too much sex and too much alcholic drinking. I suppose that is how a new author gets published. The author does keep you interested all through the story with her humor and goals.Della Meisinger
2,DEFECTIVE,"I purchased this item in Albuquerque. I played a DVD in my hotel room and discovered that after about 30 minutes, multiple white bars appeared at the top of the screen. I took it back to Circuit City and looked at 4 other identical players and they were all defective. I tried different DVD's and the same problem occurred. I took my original unit home to Kansas City and took it to Circuit City there and tested another Initial player and had the same problem. I ended up buying the new 7"" Sony. It was $200 more. Sometimes you get what you pay for."
1,Product was defective - had to return,"This player did not work. The screen went totally black within 10 seconds after putting the first dvd in it. It had sound, but no picture whatsoever. Had to return and did not buy it again. Went with a Mintek instead and it is working fine."
1,Gone through 4 in 10 months,"This is the worst electronic product I have ever purchased. Returned once to store, then the next three times to the company due to black and white bars at the top of the screen every time and had to pay them an extra $50. for the aggrivation. Now they think to appease me by sending me a model that is much cheaper than the one that I originally purchased. I have since read numerous reviews following the same problem. And to think, they continue to make this DVD player."
4,broad coverage of many topics,"This encyclopedia is ideal for a high school library, that wants to provide a broad resource about marine-related topics. Authoritatively written, but aimed at a general audience at the high school level of education or higher. Students should be able to find topics here of quite diverse interests. Oceanography, of course. Tidal waves and tsunamis [the latter being quite topical in 2005]. Readers can get an appreciation of the marine ecosystems throughout the world, and their intricacies.There is also descriptions of the economic importance of many human activities in the oceans. From fishing to oil exploration.This text might inspire some students to follow future careers in these fields."
2,Ronn in Darlington,I'm dissapointed in the product at the existing cost. It's difficult to set up. Backlight is WAY too dim. I have to reset the Mag. North often.The cost of this product should be around $29.95
2,Still Lost in the Dark,"This compass wasn't easy to set up. First, I had to buy a tiny Phillips screwdrive to open the case in order to insert the battery for the temperature transmitter. My husband, who is in construction, didn't have the correct screw driver in one of his many tool boxes. In order to attach the thermometer transmitter, I had to lie down in a driveway and search for a place to attach the device under the front of the car (if I were younger, this might have been easier). After getting this accomplished, I discovered that the backlight display on the compass (which has an easy to open battery compartment & an optional cigarette lighter power source) doesn't really work in the dark. During the day it is a reassuring device. I have yet to find out whether the icy roads warning device will function during the upcoming winter months. A rather pricey gadget."
2,Oh come on... pay extra for the inside temperature?,"A few short comings, compass seems OK and is the centerpiece of the device. I got it for the outside temp sensor, easy to install and accurate. Readout small but that's OK. Haven't tried it in the dark yet, have to wait for next winter.I can't belive that there is no onboard temp sensor. OK it's on the dash and will read 110 in the summer and whatever the defroster is kicking out in the winter but c'mon, wouldn't have been hard to put on on the unit and offer the alternative wireless sensor.Wireless sure is nice. I've had wired outside temp sensors for years and this is pretty nice. As soon as I figure out a good way to stick it on my dash and hard-wire it in, I'll be in better sorts over it.Great if you want the compass, easy temp sensor install. Good if you get a deal on it.WillFairbanks Alaska(That's why I'll have to wait untill next winter....)"
5,Busted,good product but I was sold old unit that did not work. I am using my GPS for direction and an external thermometer on my side view mirror. Low tech.
3,Good and Bad,I just got the unit last night;1) back light is weak2) No instructions came with the unit3) seems to be no way to enter magnetic declination (7 deg where I live)4) disappointed they didn't include an internal temp sensor5) I'm now worried by reading all the other reviews that support for the device has va-poo-rised6) Compass works pretty good.7) So far Temp works pretty good.8) Guess I'll use it for what it's worth and hope for the best
4,working fine,"Got this for my mom as a gift 1.5 years ago. She loves it although the suction cups won't hold on the glass very long (that's the only reason I gave 4 stars). She's just running it on batteries and I don't think she's changed them yet. It does seem to require re-calibrating occasionally, but mom has the procedure down pat. The wireless temp gauge has worked perfect."
3,Compass Review,"The compass is what I really wanted and the outside temperature was a bonus. I read several bad reviews but decided to try it anyway. It works fine so far and does exactly what I needed it to do. As an appraiser in the field, we sometimes get turned around. My last car had a built in compass and I can't do without one."
2,TOOOO DARK,"Wireless is nice and works well.Was easy to install on the inside of the grill with tie wraps. Accurate reading. Problem becomes apparent when you try to read it in anything but bright light. The amber display is so dark it becomes useless. I use a small penlight to view it in early morning, night, or evening light.The benefits of this unit are out weighted by the inability to see the display. There are easier to read and cheaper units available. Look around."
2,Temperature and compass,"The compass and temperature gauge works good and installed easily. However, it is only good in the daytime because the light is a joke. Service can not be obtained either because the company sold to another company and they will not work on them."
2,Not Worth the Price,"Pros:1. Easy installation.2. Accurate temperature readings when the sensor is placed at the right place.Cons:1. Back light is too dim. At night you have to get as close as one foot to see the digits.2. The silver cover is too shiny. You can see its reflection in the windshield. It should be a dull color like the dashboard.3. Expensive for what it does.4. You would hope the thieves are smart enough not to think it is an expensive GPS unit.Conclusion: This product is not worth buying. It has been on the market for at least two years, but you don't see the manufacturer making any improvement on things such as the back light. A Gentex auto-dimming mirror with compass and outside temperature has better value.Update on 11-5-2006: One month after installation the outside temperature sensor went dead.Update on 12-27-2006: Finally received replacement unit from the manufacturer. Customer Service was not very responsive."
4,Clean tasting water,"This filter replacement provided us with clear, refreshing water, and was easy to install. It was exactly what I needed."
5,Clean fresh taste,"I love the clean fresh taste this filter gives our water. We use it in our coffee maker exclusively, too. I have always changed our filter annually. Although Amazon has the best price of this filter, they have really become expensive."
1,Item shipped was not Amana brand,"I ordered the Amana WF401 Clean N Clear filter. I received a WaterSentinel filter instead. The filter claims to be a replacement for WF401, but it did not fit. I am returning it.I am disappointed that I was sent an off-brand item."
1,rplaced with one not clean n clear,"The only rating this will get a one for is how fast it was delivered. Sorry I can't rate something that does not even fit my refrigerator when it is replaced with something I didn't order, but with a generic replacement to supposedly fit my refrigerator. The top was cut to make it fit into my refrigerator by the company that sent me the generic one instead of the clean n clear, I ordered, that was supposed to fit. I packaged it all up and sent it back. Thank you Amazon for sending the label and everything right wway so I could send it back to you. I will have to order from the company Amana that my refrigerator is from. Some things cannot be changed to fit, As for my refrigerator filter, well, I will get it from the Amana Company and ask if they have rplaced them with generic products also."
5,Water Filters,The filters are exactly the same that Sears offers for our Kenmore Refrigerator and are less expensive. They work well and the order came quickly. We are very pleased with this order. Thank you Amazon!
1,Oops!,Wrong item. had to return it. Ended up going to Lowe's and taking my old one so that it matched. Would have been a great price if it had of been the right one.
2,BEWARE - These maybe seconds or knock-offs!,"I opened each of the 3 filter boxes and none of them have the sticker you peel off and place on the filter to remind you when to change the filter.I called Amana and they not only refused to send me 3 replacement stickers, they told me I have to go back to the compamy of purchase and complain to them! I found out the telephone number for the company that actually makes the filter for Amana and they sent me one lame looking sticker that probably came from Office Depot or Staples.WHAT A JOKE!!!"
5,Amana Water Filters,"These filters are available online at a couple of places. Though I feel the price is ridiculous everywhere, I went for the best price and shipping charge deal. I believe I got it on Amazon. Product is the same as others I have purchased. Whether or not you replace them every 6 mos. as recommended I think depends upon your level of usage, i.e., number of people in family. I go around a year with mine before changing. When the water becomes too slow--that's when I change it."
3,Expensive,"The price for this filter, in my opinion, is expensive. Don't understand why it has to be so expensive if Amana expect you to purchase 2 a year. I try to make it last longer than the 6 months recommended. My refrigerator water system begins to slow its flow after about 8 months but I hang on until approx. 12 months before changing out. Of course if it was cheaper then I would change out at recommended time frame."
5,Tasty water once again!,"I never realized the difference in the taste of the refrigerator water until I changed mine. I hadn't changed the filter before, I had just reset the light. Never again."
5,great lure for trout,I took this spinner on a camping trip to Yosemite National Park. From previous experience with trout fishing in Missouri I knew this was a great lure but they always seem to disappear when I need them. On the camping trip I caught four brook trout in less than an hour of fishing. I'll definitely be buying it again because I lost it already!
5,Well-produced DVD: Lessons presented clearly,"I am a mother of two active boys. This DVD is a life-saver. I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in water safety.How many of us are sick of looking at huge bills for private swimming lessons that seem to leave our kids' minds as soon as they get in the water again? This way, we have the skills to teach them on our own, or to support what they are learning in their lessons.I especially like the fact that there is a section on ocean safety.Bravo, Ms. Anderson!"
5,sensational,"As the mother of seven children I can tell you that Gaylene Anderson is brilliant! She teaches in a way that is so positive, that it should make all parents feel confident to teach their child to swim. Gaylene demonstrates the kind of systematic teaching that is beneficial in really all parenting skills. Bravo to Ms. Anderson and here's to many more wonderful video's such as this one! Keep up the great work!"
5,Water Fun!!!!,"My wife was sure we needed to pay for swim lessons. I bought this DVD, and my four-year old went from being a little nervous about blowing bubbles with his nose and mouth in the water, to going completely under water and getting his Spiderman diving sticks off the steps with no problem. In the past 3-4 weeks we have made about 8-10 trips to the Gym pool and he has learned so much. In addition to showing me what to teach, the DVD taught me be more patient, letting the skills emerge gradually. Ironically, in doing so he has learned much faster."
3,"Quite frustrating, occasionally rewarding","Much of this book is seems to alternate between giddy celebration of Derrida and a prickly defense of Deconstruction. The latter is probably unneeded in this book, the former makes me impatient. Caputo's ""playful"" style becomes quite annoying - unfortunate because the material is very interesting (I particularly liked the chapter on Community).The first part of the book, the interview, is quite good. The questions are engaging and Derrida's responses are clear and relevant. The rest of the book is more spotty. On the whole, the book is worthwhile but it might be more profitable to go straight to Derrida's writing."
4,Discover Derrida,"This round table discussion, delivered at Villanova in 1994, is one of the clearest and most engaging introductions to the thought of Jacques Derrida. Surrounded by faculty, and speaking in excellent English, Derrida fields a wide range of questions regarding the nature of deconstruction and how it has been misunderstood so frequently and irresponsibly by his critics. John Caputo has also provided an outstanding collection of critical commentaries which address in greater detail the issues which were brought up at the round table. Although Caputo is a little polemical at times, he does an excellent job refuting the mediocre criticisms leveled at Derrida from the likes of Sokal, Quine, Gutmann and others who are quick to condemn without truly reading the work of Derrida. This is an exceptionally clear and engaging collection of essays for any reader looking for a safe entryway to the complexity of Derrida's massive corpus."
3,Revire os Historic Anti-Semitism,The book is a useful primer but does not delve into reasons nor does in go in depth in any area. It is a useful beginning study for those with an interest in the subject.
5,A Terrific Read,"The best book from an underrated rater who has played with narrative form for decades, B: A Novel features dozens of quite funny and also moving set-ups that deconstruct themselves. The part about the protagonist-writer's reading is priceless."
3,Why do kids still admire Tupac?,"When I discovered that my 3rd graders knew who Tupac was, even though he died the year they were born, I felt that I needed to know more about Tupac. This book is published by Vibe, the official scribes of hip hop. It is a collection on interviews and articles that appeared in Vibe and they document the rise and fall of Tupac.Tupac had ""Thug Life"" tatooed on his stomach and he lived the life of a misogynist thug. He was disrespectful to everyone around him. Perhaps, as Quincy Jones suggests in the forward, Tupac could've changed into a positive force had he lived past 25. However, this book, and his own words, show him to be a negative influence on everyone he had contact with. It is very sad that he died at such a young age. It is even sadder that so many youngesters know who he was but cannot tell you about the lives of people who have accomplished great things with their lives. I have my work cut out for me next school year.Mark Gast"
5,Very Good Book,"Tupac Amaru Shakur is my idol & he deserves alot of credit for all he has done for the hip hop community. I buy everything about 2pac & after i read this book (Tupac Shakur by Vibe), it was one of the best things done for Tupac & i really appreciate it. I have had a tupac page on the net for a while & the URL is: http://members.tripod.com/~ripx2pac/index.htmlthanks for your time"
1,Pretty average,"There are one or two good tracks on this CD but all in all pretty dissapointing. I would rather go for Sphongle, Ott or any of those masters."
1,didn't like this at all,"I teach yoga and I'm always looking for ambient music to accompany my class--this cd did not fit at all. This cd is funky but the music is a bit too traditional for a yoga class. The strong female ululations are a little too sharp to induce a relaxed, rythmic feel to my class.For the amount of money paid I hoped that I could use this cd more in class."
5,Still the best line of wrestling figures ever,"My reasons for writing a review on this figure, the Jakks Deluxe Aggression version of Chris Benoit, are twofold. First, it's good to see figures of Benoit still in heavy rotation on sites such as Amazon. If it influences just a few young wrestling fans to seek out and watch some classic Benoit matches, it's worth it. And of course, Jakks line of 'Deluxe' figures, first for WWE and now TNA, remain the coolest wrestling action figures by a large margin.The 2nd reason is the primary one, however; the only actual inspiration for this review is to fix the absurd one-star rating given by a clueless customer. His reason for the low rating is because he didnt receive it on time. So he's angry with either Amazon or one of their sellers, but he took it out on the product."
2,It Seems I've Heard (Most of) This Song Before,"If you've never read a book about Richard Rodgers, this one may interest you -- otherwise, stay away. The trouble is that almost everything here is quoted from previous books, with the exception of some pretty basic discussions of Rodgers as a composer. There is practically no insight into Rodgers the man, and only a little into Rodgers the artist. You would do far better reading Rodgers autobiography MUSICAL STAGES (which is relied upon far too heavily in this book), or Hugh Fordin's Hammerstein bio GETTING TO KNOW HIM. All in all, this book is not awful -- just awfully dull."
1,Not worth the money - wobbles all over the place,"Used this (or tried to...) to install an additional table in my RV. As stated in another review, the hinge points are really sloppy (especially the top one). The only option is to drill out the existing pin & replace it with something tighter otherwise the table sways like it's in a roller derby. I bought this because of the ""quick release"" which is nice -- just not nice enough to offset the sloppy workmanship..."
4,strong bracket,"Arrived quickly, strong brackets, was somewhat disappointed the shelf does not fold down flat. Sticks out approximately 1"" at bottom in down position. Convenient easy to use levers to lower shelf. Remember they are not sold in pairs, price is for one bracket only."
4,Courtesy and customer satisfaction,"After an initial frustration about their failure to ship in a timely manner as forecast by amazon, this company refunded my handling and shipping fees with courtesy and an open desire to provide customer satisfaction. The product was as expected. I would do business with this company in the future."
5,Nice brackets,"I got these because there is no room for a nightstand on my partner's side of the bed. I installed a shelf on the closet door next to his side, and they work great. The shelf is up every night and down every day. I spray painted them to match the painted shelf and door, and six months later we're still very happy with the result."
5,Folding brackets that are affordable,Worked great! We added a cutting board in our trailer. These made it easy to fold down when not in use.
5,Excellent brackets,"Sturdy, strong brackets. Highly recommend these heavy-duty brackets for a shelf of short depth (although I believe because of the strength of these brackets, two of these could support a long shelf very well. Nicely made, no pinching of fingers when opening or closing.As almost always, Amazon came though with the best price and shipping."
1,Skip this hinge company.,This bracket has sloppy fits at all the critical points allowing it to sway with more than 5 pounds on it. I had to drill out the swagged bushings and install larger diameter pins to salvage the brackets. It was also shipped late with no notice it had been held up. Skip this company.
5,Is the price per pair or for each,Not a review but can anyone tell me if the brackets priced per pair or is the price for each. No concerned on what they cost just don't need two pair.
3,Not Sure What This Is,"I don't believe George Leaner (before passing) was licensing songs from his family of record labels, other than to P-Vine, in Japan, about 1977. If you like the Five Du-Tones, seek that P-Vine LP. If you want to hear them in even better quality, be patient, they and others (often bootlegged) may appear on legit CDs in the near future."
5,Perfect.,I bought this for my 16 month old son that has a big head and on the smallest setting it fits him perfect for plenty of room to grow. Great quality even though it was made in China.
5,Great kids helmet!,Beautiful colors and design! Has sparkles in the finish which little girls love. Love the adjustable fit system! Can get good use out of it till your child completely grows out of it. It goes perfectly with my daughter's bike and she loves it and wears it without reminders which is a big plus!
3,Child size not Youth,"The Giro website lists 2 sizes for the Rodeo helmet:Youth - 50-57cmChild - 50-54cmThe description for this product is not clear - the title is ""Youth"". Amazon sells another Rodeo helmet with ""Child"" in the title. So I thought I was going to get the Youth size here.What we received is the Child size, which is too small for us. Helmet looks nice but it's going back."
5,"Nice fitting, cute helmet","I purchased this for my 6 y.o. with a tiny head. She wanted a more ""cool"" looking helmet rather than the oversized ones for infants. It is a nice fitting helmet and has nice adjustments. Would recommend it."
1,I WISH IT WORKED!!!!!!!,First off let me say after totaly exhausting tdk tech Support the product still dosn't work. My computer in which greatly exceeds all Requirements for the unit still dosn't reconize it. tdk finally said that it simply didn't work with some computers. So buy at your on risk but what ever you do don't get it though office depot on this site first they fill your oder though tech depot which dosn't take returns on this product. I finally got most of my money back but it wasn't easy. So If you try this product please go with another store.
4,Excellent debut recital,"This is an excellent recital, with Gergiev's sister on the piano. Shtoda seems on the way to becoming a big name opera star.The only reason that this gets 4 stars not 5 is that EMI chose to issue the original red and white 'Debut Series' release without texts or translations, something later remedied with a new cover (featuring Shtoda in an ethereal grey photo), but with the same catalogue number.Anyone wanting a better documented introduction to Russian song might be better off with the Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky or Glinka discs by mezzo Lina Mkrtchyan on Opus111 (cyrillic script), or the 'Russian Romance' series by tenor Larin on Chandos (cyrillic again), or the 'Russian Images' recitals by bass Savenko on Hyperion (romanized script)."
4,Individualized Education Programs for the Common Man,"In the world of education, nothing comes easy. Individualized Education Programs, IEPs, form the cornerstone of at-risk education and special accomodations. This text presents an easy-to-use method of dealing with IEPs and their many elements. Highly suggested reading for not only special-education educators, but for all educators."
5,great tool: get the 93 edition,"I am just writing to say that there is a newer 1993 third edition of this invaluable book which I use in teaching a graduate level special education law & program design class.It is still the best in terms of translating law into the practice of instruction., I also supplement the book ( since even this edition predates IDEA 97) with R. Turnbull & M. Cilley's paperback on IDEA 97 amendments"
4,DVD Please!!!!,"Like many others this movie was one of my all time favorites!! I came on here hoping to find a DVD version. I'm so disappointed there is not one to be found. My husband keeps telling me I'm the only one who must have liked this movie lol Glad to know I'm not alone. My parents still have the one I watched as a child but it's so worn, I'm afraid to play it now. We don't even own a VHS player anymore, so no way to watch this if I did buy it :("
5,I cant beleive its around!!,"Oh my god!! This movie really brought out the imagination in me as a kid. I was always to make the magic rock in the movie by digging for rocks just like it. It even inspired me to build a tree house. This rules!!!!! By the way, I want it for myself, not kids."
5,the ewok adventure,This film was my friend during a very lonely childhood. Oh how I wanted to go live on the moon of endor! The special effects are great and the cast is fun! Chukah trok rules!!!
5,comprehensive coverage of software engineering,"The author achieves a commendable balance between breadth and depth. None of the topics are discussed at a superficial level. In addition, this text is written in a highly readable style. External sources are frequently referenced, quoted, and summarized. There is an emphasis on software metrics in chapter 5 and chapter 18. A section on structured methods is contained in chapters 11-14. A section on object-oriented methods is contained in chapters 19-23. Excellent introduction to advanced topics such as formal methods, reengineering, client/server, and computer-aided software engineering. Breaks CASE tools into 23 categories. Each chapter includes a set of problems and points to ponder."
2,verbose,i'm using this book for a graduate software engineering course. i don't feel that i've gotten my money's worth. i expected a book that was clear and concise; i found it tobe neither. i've been very disappointed
3,"Good content, delivery is difficult to comprehend.","I have worked in system development and maintenance for over 18 years. In that time I have performed programmer, analyst and/or leadership roles on a variety of software engineering projects. I would say that classifies me as a practitioner. I think this book does a good job covering many processes and techniques of software engineering. I especially like the References, Points to ponder and Further readings/web sites at the end of each chapter. However, Dr Pressman's delivery is is not easy for me to follow. Many places in this book I found it hard to sort the meaningful message from the filler sentences. Also the vocabulary of Dr Pressman is not that of a typical technical developer and makes the reading that much more difficult. I am used to acronyms but not the 5 and 6 syllable words when common terminology would suffice.So, after cutting through the static and frequently referencing my dictionary I found the book to be very helpful."
1,Very Disappointed in the movie,Really didn't like the movie. I should have listened to the reviews poor rating. Recommend you rent the movie first before buying. The First one was great. But this one is bad.
2,"also, you WILL be quizzed during the credits roll","there is no explanation for a sequel to something as hopeless as ghost rider I. and i suppose there will be no real explanation for a sequel to ghost rider II either. not a problem, as long as i am not drugged or tortured into watching it."
1,Straight GARBAGE!,"If I had known the guys who did the CRANK movies had directed this, I would of stayed far away from this. I hated the CRANK movies and I don't like their directing style. The movie was all over the place and Nick Cage (who I'm still a fan of) was mess. It looked like he was doing poor Jim Carey facial expressions at times. If they make a third movie can someone please read a Ghost Rider comic and use that as an example! 1 star and I wish i could of given this no stars."
1,Stop do not waist your cash on this trash.,"Ghost rider must save boy from the Devil. First let me say I am a Nicolas Cage fan and I do not blame him for this abortion of a film. I blame the director and the writers of this pitiful excuse for a movie. If you pay full price plus the 3D charge you are in for a total rip off. I would pass on a $1.00 rental on this turd let alone the thought of paying for a blue ray copy. I fought myself not to see this pitiful movie and gave into some internet hype and radio plugs by Nick Cage but I should have went with my gut. There is no story here that is worth seeing, it is as if a 15 year old stoner came up with this plot while slamming Robitussin with his drop out buddies. This is the worst movie of 2012 so far and I pray it is the worst that I pay to see in the theater for the rest of the year. The Coup de grce is Christopher Lambert, that alone should keep you away from this turd."
2,"Ghost Rider in Hell and you by his side, if you see this!","I understand what Goyer and Cage was trying to do with this movie but it fails on so many levels. G.R. was created in the 1970's and this movie was going for that whole, ""Grindhouse,"" feel and it delievers but weak. The first movie needed better action, villains (the trio of fallen angels could've been a threat but nope) and this movie gives us better action + Blackout (much better but I could have done better with the action directing). Spirit of Vengeance also missed many chances for some funny/serious jokes and not this corny crap. The first movie was way better as far as everything else goes (Mephisto, more of a Marvel Comic style in family, friends and a lesson learned). In complete and honest truth, the Ghost Rider character will not get the movie he so richly deserves until Marvel Studios does him justice."
2,The Spirit of Vengeance in a wimpy sequel,"The first film was surprisingly fun to watch; not so with this one. I was delighted to hear a sequel was being released; I was all set to go to the theatre to see it. THEN came a deluge of bad reviews that quickly changed my mind (note: It premiered at the box office in sixth place, not good). I'll probably skip the DVD release as well.I'm sure with a bad sequel, the filmmakers have effectively killed off the franchise. As one of Marvel Comics' eeriest characters, GR deserves better!"
1,Wow someone give me a pillow,I barely got threw half the film and Ill tell you Idris Elba should go to the bank and return the money they paid him for this role not because he was bad at it but because they convinced him to play the role in this awful film if you can call it that. Wow what a freaking Bomb of a movie the first one was bad but you could at least get through it. I happen to love and respect the directors previous work I think they are very good at what they do but the true curse of this Ghost Rider found its way out once again with a vengeance (no pun intended). I almost felt as if I were set on fire for even trying to give it a viewing and Nicolas Cage love the Cage but Damn brother whats with the run of Bad films whats happening with the choices.(Your slowly loosing public respect for your craft). Try and find the fire within you once again and stay away from Johnny Blaze. I would not recommend watching this movie even to the undead.
1,Garbage,Do yourself a favor and don't buy this movie .I was so excited to her about this but after seeing it I couldn't believe how bad this movie was .The acting and the story and location and Special Effects are a joke .
3,"Completely unlike the first movie, but still pretty good. Nicolas cage is very good.","If you watch it as a separate movie with almost nothing to do with the first then it's very good and entertaining. The action sequences are well done, and Nicholas cage seemed to let himself go a little and have some fun in the part. The only disappointment was that Peter Fonda was available and could've played the devil again, I don't know why they didn't use him. The new devil is pretty good too, but no Peter Fonda."
2,Ghost Rider:Spirit of Vengeance,"I know the first movie was not well liked,but i enjoyed it.After watching this movie i liked it even more.This movie is a mess.Nicholas Cage is even more over the top than usual.The Ghost Rider cgi makes him look like hes smoldering,not on fire.Theres cutscenes when the Rider uses his powers and the background is black that look horrible.Check it out at your own risk YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!"
5,Great Sequel!,"I like Nick Cage in almost all of the movies he has done. He is a first rate actor. After having seen the first Ghost Rider, it was a no brainer to pick up the sequel. The movie is action packed with a great story line and I liked it better than the original. For those wanting a demonic type movie - this is a good one. Not recommended for kids under 13 as it can stir up some nightmares. Hope there is a 3rd one =)"
3,not one of the best,"I like Nick Cage, but this is not the best movie. The plot is very predictable. The thing that makes is ok is the special effects. There are several good chase scenes and explosions."
3,not the greatest,I found this movie to be a let down compared to the first ghost Rider movie. This 1 seems to be kind of thrown together with just punched in action instead of the firm solid storyline that the first offers. If you're looking for a way to kill a couple hours this is okay to watch. If you're looking for something to make you want more this 1 is not for you.
2,This movie..,This movie sucked and I found it in despert need of better film and it was just bad and nothing like DC
3,Ghost Rider,"The movie came as described,...played great,..sound was good.....but again in this movie,...the plot was lame.Nothing like the first movie,....need real help in plot and making movies, i thought Cage was better then this,......"
1,Blank Disc,I didn't really watch the movie to rate it. I got a blank disc when I put it in the bluray player there was no picture. I checked the HDMMI cable several times to make sure it wasn't that but each time it registered that it was good. Most of the movies I get from Amazon are good but this soured me alittle.
1,Movie was so dumb,"This was one of the worst comic book movies i ever see. I don't know which was worse..the first one or this. Clearly studios have no problem burning through cash. Ghost Rider is a cool @ss character too and they make the movie so cartoonish. The acting was bad, the story was junk and the cgi was definitley not as good as The Avengers. I think its safe to say Nick Cage is passed his prime, though i see another national treasure movie in the future so he can pay off his debts. I am going to give Seeking Justice a try and see if it goes back to his old ways like Con Air or Face Off, but not keeping my hopes up."
4,My Ghost Rider Review,"This is your typical Nicholas Cage action flick but hey, I enjoy watching him perform. The action was pretty much non-stop and the plot was understood. I would highly recommend this one for all the Nicholas Cage fans out there."
3,Not Bad,"At first I ordered ""Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance, but I read that it was soooo bad that I canceled the order and ordered the original Ghost Rider. I ordered it (as I order most of my DVDs) in Blu-ray. Some people claim they don't see a difference, but if that is the case they most not have a good HD TV.I liked this movie. It's not like the movie ""Snatch"" which I could watch over and over. But it is worth seeing."
2,Yes....well....hmmmm.,"I have no idea where Nic Cage is going these days,* he might have made this cos he didn't get to put on Supermans suit in planned remake a couple of years ago, which didn't eventuate, so, maybe he thought. ""I'll do 'Kick Ass' and this one and see what happens"".Really he should have stuck to 'Kick Ass' and insisted the ending, or his ending, be changed.It is possible you may like this, I thought it was ordinary."
3,Crazy and cool at the same time!,"The first Ghost Rider was full of plot, but the action felt forced!Now we have this one:1. It was great that Nicholas Cage came back as Johnny Blaze!2. The underfoot actors were not well known actors, but they were great withtheir characters!3. I like how we see that more people are making bad choices by makingdeals with the devil!4. David Goyer, who worked on The Dark Knight Trilogy and the Blade trilogygave us a decent plot!5. The visual effects were more convincing than the first movie's fx were!6. The guy who played the devil was really creepy!What I didn't like was:1. The movie felt like it needed a thicker plot!2. Some of the action felt mindless!3. I wish they would have explained what happened to Johnny Blazeand his curse at the end of the movie: Why was he saying ""I can feelit"" and then be the Ghost Rider with blue flames?If the movie had a thicker plot and if the action wasn't mindless it would have been better!My grade: B- or three stars!"
3,Ok I like Nicolas Cage,This ain't no National Treasure. Supernatural anti hero and flaming skull who'd have thunk it. Actually Nicolas is a bit over exposed and needs to back off and take a vacation.
1,Horrible film,Worst acting I've ever seen Cage do. And he's done some stinkers. This really not worth anyone's money on standard DVD let alone Blu-ray.
1,What Where They Thinking,"Think of this movie as a reboot and not a sequel, first off. It is much closer to the comic than it's predecessor, but the cinematography is terrible as is the acting. Absoultly horrible. One scene you get Johnny Blaze trying to fight off being the Ghost Rider which was absolutely hysterical, only to crash his bike......seriously. Why Europe? His main weapon, Penence Stare looks more like a love scene......in fact I am wondering if it worked at all.....then the the meeting with the gent who know where to find one of the principle bad guys is at some weird gathering where it looked like a MMA smack down......against a pig......seriously. Rent/Borrow the movie and save your cash. It is very apparent that Hollywood will not do Ghost Rider any justice at all, just like ruining Punisher......sorry to say."
5,DARK FUN!!!!,"A lot of people didn't like this movie...It's not supposed to be a Drama, just a comic book, a real cool and fun comic book. I think it achieves perfectly what it was made for...Can't understand the people that have said that this movie is not good at all. Actually Cage is trying some new body language and his character Blaze is just really sarcastic and pissed of because of his curse. He hasn't made peace with it, so that's why he is like he is...Still it's not a deep movie, but it was never meant to be!!! I enjoyed both Ghost Riders movie. But this one is much more fun than the other one!!! If you're expecting a drama like the new Batman movies (which I LOVE!)then this one is not for you. If you want to have fun and see the Dark Side of Blaze then GET THIS MOVIE!!! I loved it..."
1,LAME...,"I rented this out of the Redbox and was extremely disapointed.. other reviewers will go into long detail, im just going to say on entertainment value i was Highly Disapointed.. I wouldnt sit through that mess again if somebody else paid for the popcorn and drinks.."
1,One of the worst movies I have ever seen.,"This is so unbearably bad that I had to turn it off. It is cornier than Oprah's stool on the 4th of July. Nicholas Cage has made some tankers before, but this tops the notch. Marvel should be embarrassed and needs to do a REAL Ghost Rider movie. Not these garbage films. The first Ghost Rider is pretty bad, but looks like Saving Private Ryan compared to this turd of a film. Save your money."
3,Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengence,"A so-so sequel to the first Ghost Rider movie, some scenes could have been tightened up, other scenes lengthened. This movie could have been better with a little more thought into the script and action scenes. If the decision is to do a 3rd one, perhaps those involved with it will consider their options and try to produce a better film."
3,Ghost Rider - Spirit of Vengeance,"The movie quality, all the way around, was good. The movie itself, the story, was lacking a lot. Only worth watching once; maybe twice after a few years."
4,good view!,Bought the movie for my son! who loved it! I enjoyed the movie also. Not usually something I would pick to watch but found it entertaining.
5,awesome movie,this movie was great. Nicholas Cage was excellent in this movie. I loved the first one so I had to buy this one to add to it. I would highly recommend it to anyone who saw the first one.
3,They tried too hard,"First, I am a big Nicholas Cage fan. Second, I really liked the first movie. Unfortunately and as much as I hate to say it, the best part of this movie was the twinkie. The writers and directer basically castrated the ghost rider and made him into a big pansy. Three things would have helped this movie. 1) Get rid of the ridiculous cackaling that Nicholas had to do in order to keep the ghost at bay. It was distracting. 2) Give the badass priests more opportunity to be badass. 3) Bring blue ghost in on the final battle.Another reviewer said that this movie spells doom for the franchise. I fear he is correct. Too bad."
2,Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengance,"As a fan of this comic, I was dissapointed with this movie. Seems like Nick Cage is trying to hang on too hard. Could have done without the narrative..movie was a bit campy despite the good cast. Better luck next time?"
3,The old bike was better looking,"The old bike was better looking, I liked that bike better than the one in goast 2.Cage acted like a drug junkie, with a lot of neck movements that looked more like a nerve problem.I like Cage as an actor, but this one left me wondering...Dont know how close it was to the comic book, never read it, and don't really care toLiked the first movie, and the second is to me just so so to meIf they do make a third movie I hope they bring back the first bike, it was hot.and I will probly buy it too ( the movie, not the bike. )"
1,Pass,"Well, the first one was pretty good and had a solid story line. This one, however, didn't take any of the first movies good content and put it to use in this one. The ghost rider is completely different (worse in my opinion) and the dialog is pretty lame. It has a natural born killers theme to it when he changes. Boy did they mess this one up...had lots of potential too."
1,NOT 3D!,"I cannot believe I spent the money for this 3D movie...this was not a 3D movie. I don't know if this movie was originally released in 3D at the theater, but I couldn't imagine if I had gone to the theater with my family and spent $48 to see this movie!The movie itself I also did not care for. I did not like the plot and thought it was a horrible sequel!"
3,Good movie,"Hey the first Ghost Rider wasn't fine cinema and neither is this, but it's a good movie to get primed up for high budget comic blockbusters coming this year with The Avengers and Batman. The Ghost Rider is more hellish looking in this and the ending really makes up for the lackluster 80 minutes you had to sit through. Not a classic, not as good as the first, but if you need to escape the winter blues, this is mindless fun for the weekend."
1,REALLY BAD!!!!,If you liked the first one you will hate this one. Absolutely no connection to the first on except for Cage and the name of the movie. Super poor acting. Cage acted like he was insane. Poor affects. Didn't even have the same bike for the Ghost Rider. Really a disappointment.
1,Ghost Rider Spirit Of Vengeance,"It was a very poor sequel to a first good movie, seems as though they lost the recipe or opted to make changes not proven on previous success."
1,Did not like,"The movie was underwhelming to say the very least. Not well thought out as a plot, it could have been better written as the original one was. Nothing special."
4,Good movie all around,The ghost rider: spirit of vengeance is a good movie but the plot just wasn't as good as the first one since all they brought back was Nicholas Cage but all in all the fight scenes and special effects was good
3,Comic book character,"This follow-up to the first Ghost Rider is not that good. Set in Europe, much of theplot seems contrived, and Nicholas Cage looks old and tired. Special effects aregood, and the action scenes will keep the viewer engaged. However, there wassomething fresh and appealing about the first Ghost Rider missing in the sequel."
4,Better than reviewed.,"I don't understand all the hate and bad reviews for this movie. It was a good movie, a fun ride and a compelling story! Idris Elba is always welcome as far as I'm concerned. Yes, the tone of this movie is much darker - less Disney-esque - and a tiny bit gruesome, but that is Ghost Rider! It is based on a comic-book, but this is not a super-hero. Vengeance is not optional. Justice is preferred, but not mandatory.The most under-rated performance in the movie is Johnny Whitworth. Perhaps best known for Empire Records, he plays against type as one of the villains, Ray Carrigan, and he is amazing. He makes decisions with the role that makes him scarier than he is written. There is a casual evil to his performance that was wildly successful. It reminds me of Nick Cassavetes role of Packard in The Wraith plus a dash of Vincent Ventresca.Watch this. It is PG-13, but the horror aspects may be better suited to older children."
2,Not sure I will watch again,"This movie had a lot of bad parts, but i just kept on watching. There were a few good moments. There wasn't much surprise in the plot, you could see it coming from a long ways away."
5,ghost rider 2 spirit of vengence,Well gotta say don't see this movie in 3d it sucks. But this movie has promise its a little slow on the get up but give it time. Its not a family movie at any right. But it has a good ending.
1,dissapointed,i was expecting sooo much more! compared to the 1st one which i lovedi thought it was silly and unimaginative compared to what it could have beenwish i could get my money back!!
1,Horrible,I love Nicholas Cage however this is one of the wrorst movies I have seen in a long time. Save yourself and don't watch it
1,VERY Disappointing!,I have no words to describe how truly bad this film and Nicolas Cage were....not to mention the other has been and no name actors in this flop.
2,OMG This was horrible,"I won't say much other than do not waste your time or money on this movie. It is horrible, I loved the first ghost rider but this was not even close to watchable."
3,??????what the hell?????????,"i have to say i was expecting more. the only good points was the action with ghost rider.....and what the hell was with nick cages over acting?????? ghost rider is suppose to be a dark anti hero, not a guy that tell jokes, or acts quirky even after he's transformed. could have been better. also there was some point where he could have sped up the killing, like when the ghost rider 1st appears for a fight, he heald this thugs head for like a whole min till he killed him with his stare. the directors that did this movie also did the 'crank' series. idk if that was their direction with nick's character, but this movie could have been more dark and serious. and wheres the spikey leather jacket???!!!"
1,Refund Please,"I wont waste my time describing how poor a movie this is. Gone are any interesting elements of the 1st movie. Read and believe all the other poor reviews.....wish I did before I paid for it. So bad, I turned it off 15 minutes into the film. Nuff Said!!!"
4,Movie was good,I like the first Ghost Rider movie better than this one. This movie had good special effects and the story line was OK. I just thought the first one was better.
4,okay,"Well the first one was good, this was an okay follow up.The character remains true. But the first was better."
2,"Great service, bad video.","The,product was delivered as promised and on time. The movie sucked. It had very little plot and the action scenes were dragged out and the CG was bad."
2,Rent from redbox,"Stay away from purchasing this movie not like the first one. The first ghost rider was awesome in graphics and the sweet bike, in this one the rider was tight but the story line was a joke to make. They tired to hard to make more modern time and failed do not buy rent at the redbox for $1 a day."
2,not fun,"the first movie was at least fun and humorous, this one has none of that. The acting isn't good and that's sad considering that three of the actors can actually act."
2,gost rider spirit of vengeance,"Bad acting, did not follow the the story line of the first Gost Rider. The first Gost rider beat the devil and at the end he was to continue fighting the devil and help man kind. In this movie the Gost Rider just stood around flexing and growling. Instead of meeting evil head on."
2,two thumbs down,"Too bad,Typical failure of sequel block buster movies.Why in Europe? Why Yamaha instead of HD?Cage didn't have to be a ghost rider over there, did he?"
1,Horrible!,"I tried to give it 0 stars, but the rating system wouldn't allow for it. The movie was a complete waste of time and money. The plot was all over the place and had many holes. Don't bother, you'll be disappointed & left wanting your brain-cells back."
2,Wasn't a total flop,"Was a complete and total let down from the 1st movie. Story line had potential, but you figure out real fast that this is not a Hollywood film. Cage did an ok job on the movie himself, but like most of his stuff of late, it just seems he's putting out movies lately to get a paycheck and nothing else. Most the actor in the movie are either nonames you've never heard of or my guess is they are Europian actors. There were only 2 or 3 face I recognized. I would deffinatly have to give this movie a c- on the B movie scale even. It really was that bad."
2,Rented it by myself... Thankful!!!,"I rented this movie because everyone in my family was out of town. This was bad bad bad!!! Acting was bad, the story was bad. Everything was bad! No wonder it was a box office flop!!! Nick Cage does not make a superhero. And this superhero is not ok for kids."
4,What's with the complaints? Was a decent movie!,"I see so many bad reviews for this flick and wonder why?Ghostrider is not a typical superhero like Superman or Spider-Man--He's a dark hero.I liked this one better than the 1st GR film--For the story was fast paced, ""read"" like a comic and, with the animated intervals, got to the point to keep the movie flowing with action.Special Effects were great, I liked the actors and the acting and it didn't have a drawn-out feeling like some other super-hero flicks (Such as the Hollywood, butt-kissing recent Batman movies).If you liked super hero flicks in the realm of Daredevil, Electra, Jonah Hex and Punisher: War Zone then you should appreciate and enjoy this film..."
2,What just happened!,"The first Ghost Rider film and Drive Angry were bookends of redneck fun for fans of mindless action and Nick Cage. I liked them both. But this film feels like a foreign attempt to recreate American drive-in style entertainment and it comes off as odd in all the worst ways. The special affects are great, but the acting and directing are off kilter. Even Cage comes off as a parody of himself."
1,Disappointing,"Supposed to be a squeal of the first movie, it isn't, Doesn't even follow the comics, the writers/director/producer should have watched the first movie and/or read the comics before making this."
1,Demonic Possession of the Writers,"Some demonic possessed evil is responsible for this non-creative (i.e. heavily borrowed) writing, directing and robotic acting and needs to be constrained by a zinc coffin and tossed into the Mariana Trench. This evil intends to zombify us all with another Exorcist II style bad child with evil connections and with the usual black robed worshippers in a semicircle with the usual incantations. The usual, don't sell your soul, or you'll die to regret it with the usual monk sacrifice. The only redeeming part is of course a couple of minutes of CGI burning skeleton on burning 'cycle. How we humans continue to be mesmerized by fire. I'm so inspired I think I'll go and put a match to a lighter fluid doused Halloween skeleton on a toy motorcycle."
1,"Awful, Could not finish watching!","I like to think of myself as an avid movie watcher and I was hyped about this one. Passed it up in theaters (thankfully) and decided to wait for Bluray. I eagerly checked the mail looking for the red netflix envelope and there it was, popped it in a few hours later and got to watching.Something is just wrong and off about this movie. The acting, the directing style, the plot is wishy-washy, it's hard to exactly put my finger on. I found myself falling asleep within the 1st 30 minutes and finally could not bear it anymore, turned it off. If I had known the same guys who made Crank 1 and 2, I would have passed it up. Now that I think about it, it's totally obvious it was made by the same guys. This falls very short of the 1st one, which was no jewel either but much better than this."
1,Should be free as an apology from Marvel Studios...,"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance is the worst Marvel Comics movie to date... Yes, it's worse than Daredevil, Elektra, and to those who hated it, Ang Lee's HULK. The first GHOSTRIDER film is superior in every way, so stick with that. I fear the mighty Marvel movie machine will soon run out of steam, after the Avengers have their time in the spotlight. The upcoming ""Amazing Spider-Man"" looks really lame, too..."
1,Even Worse than Green Lantern,"Just when I thought that the Green Lantern movie was the worst Comic Book Adaptation ever......along comes Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. Now I'll be the first to admit that I'm not well versed in the Ghost Rider mythos, but I do know a good movie when I see one and Spirit of Vengeance is NOT a good movie.....at all. The first 5-10 minutes of the movie started out strong and then did a 180 and went downhill fast. Bad acting, bad writing.....pretty much bad everything. The special effects for Ghost Rider were decent, but that's about it. I was really looking forward to this movie and I was let down by how bad it was. Seriously, don't waste your money. Wait for it to hit STARZ or HBO if you really want to see it. There's always Redbox, but I wouldn't waste the $1.20."
1,Awful Movie,Don't waste your money. This movie is not worth what you spend or your time watching it. I am disappointed in Nicholas Cage for making it.
3,Okay,"The first Ghost Rider was okay, and so was this one; anyone expecting a great film from Nicholas Cage is silly."
1,OOPS,"Should have stopped at the first one. This was money that should have never been spent - not just me watching it, them making it"
2,Movie Review..,"The DVD came in great condition, as expected but the movie sucked. It is NOTHING like the first one at all. So if that is what you are expecting... don't get it."
2,Awful!,Awful plot. Ghost Rider has become a total whimp and barely speaks at all. Terrible dialog with bad acting by nick cage. it was so.bad we turned it off.
2,Huge Disappointment!,"As a big Ghost Rider fan dating back to the 1970's comic book, I must say that this movie was a big letdown. I was one of the few people that actually liked the first Ghost Rider film. While it was no work of art, I thought it captured the look and the feel of the character pretty well. This latest effort really has no soul, its all over the place. I like Nic Cage as an actor, but I really wished he had stepped aside and let someone else take the role. Ghost Rider is one of the most powerful and feared heroes in the Marvel universe but in this film he is depicted as a twitching skull-faced clown. The first film was a hell of a lot better. I am glad I didn't listen to my 8 year old son and buy this."
2,Poor enough to doom the franchise,"I was a comic book kid, GR was one of my favorites. I loved the first film and like Nicholas Cage, this film was just 'hollow', visually not as pleasing, story flat, even if it was more true to form as far as GR wanting to rid himself of the curse. Don't buy it, only worth one viewing."
3,Ghost Rider,"Great shipping, but we were not impressed with this movie. It felt like a let down from the first Ghostrider. First one was much better."
2,Disappointed!!!,"This one lacked the spirit of the first one. Poor dialog from start to finish (a.k.a. poorly written) and the directing was lacking. What a shame, this had potential to be a great franchise. Grandkids didn't even like it. Borrow a copy from someone before you buy it, you'll be glad you did."
1,Was better the first time.,"This time around the story is bad, the acting is bad, and the angles and cinematography are just poor. Too many time the rider does the stare and it looks like he is constipated. Really too bad since there are some excellent actors in this movie. They really ruined this one. The flow of the movie is questionable at best, just like the plot."
1,Ghost rider 2,I sure was hopeing for a better movie the first one was better all the way around this one was very cheesie...It is a waste of money I would not recommend it to buy for anyone.
1,Worst Movie Ever!!!!!!,"Worst movie ever, if the movie studio had to much money and needed to get rid of it that badly, they should have just burned the money and taped it. It would have been better than this pile of trash."
2,Highly disappointing,"I'm a Cage fan,and i feel compelled to say that even he doesn't save this mediocre production...Poor acting across the board, predictable plot,supernatural powers should be awesome, but instead they came out unconvincing and not believable in this one, almost as a farce...not worth $3.99, maybe $0.50"
2,Falls short for me...,"I was expecting this to be more like the 1st one, but wow, this felt way different. I didn't like how they did the filming, nor the music, felt totally like a Brit production, but to be fair, I'm not a fan of Brit movies. The rider was way different, looked like a rag doll puppet, gets hit by an rpg in the beginning, and he ends up in the hospital?? Don't get me wrong effects in spots were very cool. However, just a lot of unanswered questions, felt like we jumped right in the middle of a movie already in progress, Brit style film... Some cameos, but overall, nowhere near what I was hoping for, and expecting, based on the first movie."
2,Not an absolute fail,"Found myself keeping casual conversation while a lot of talking was going on. I didn't care that I missed dialog. Everything that wasn't confrontation seemed drawn out as if in the sequel we are now to discover a deeper meaning for what we already know to be the storyline. I would not have walked out on it as I have with some other movies, but I am very glad to see it through Amazon which doesn't cost as much as a movie or Dvd."
1,So so so so so so so terrible.,This is by far the worst movie I have seen in the past three years. It is the all time worst attempt at a Marvel movie that i have ever seen (and I've seen most of them). Don't even bother.
1,"OMG, What a waste of money","I liked the first Ghost Rider, I'm a fan of Cage and I'm so disappointed in this one. If I could, I would ask for my money back! I've seen better B rated movies than this one and this one had the feel of such a movie, low budged and acting not required.Anyone thinking of renting or buying this movie should not waste their money on this one."
1,Because evidently I cannot give a half star..,"This flic fails on so many levels. Embarrassingly over the top performances by most of the actors, pretentiously campy action, strange cadence, low budgey feel. Was an effort to get through. I really hope the dr Strange movie saves the Marvel Knights line. Just imagine a supernatural Avengers'esque team movie including Blade, Dr Strange, Ghost Rider etc.."
1,Big European Turd,This movie is crap from start to finish. I am now using this DVD as a drink coaster. I am giving it one star because this review feature will not let me give it any less.
3,OK Flick,"I would give this a 2, but Idris Elba is worth another star. This was not as good as the first one. Nick Cage was weird, and not in a good way. His acting was over the top and missed the mark in just about every scene. So disappointing! I'm sorry I purchased it. Spent $18, what the frack! Should've waited for the rental, but my expectations were too high."
1,Ghost Rider-Spirit of Vengeance,I love the first Ghost Rider. It was fairly true to the comic book and the story was good. When I heard about the second movie I was excited.When I started watching Spirit of Vengeance I just couldn't believe they could mess up something so bad. While the story line was again good Nicholas Cage acted like a lunatic and was nothing like the Ghost Rider of the first movie or the comic book character. Also what happened to Gost Rider's biker outfit. Totally off the mark in every way. They just messed up any chance of a number three. This movie was not worth watching.
2,What A rip off !,"The first was way better than the second!Ghost Rider looked nothing like the first.Nicholas Cage acting in the first was great,but the second was a disaster..Even the special effect sucked.."
1,Ghost Rider sprit of vengeance,"This movie looked like it was on a low budget. Watch the first one, better story better graphics. No need to watch this movie"
5,Part 2,I usually don't like the 2nd part of a movie because it almost always seems that they can't top the last one...That's not the case here! This movie was as good as the first by a long shot!!!
3,Not even close to the first,"Not a bad movie but nothing the first. Direction is bad. Special effects only ok, and the story lacks depth"
3,SO-SO,"I liked the firet one, but this one fell way short of the first story. It was more like a sequel that was fulfilling a contract--not a need to continue a legend. Very disappointing."
4,Ghost Rider 2,I t was good but I could tell when something was coming in parts of this movie I would have liked it better if there was no way for me to know when something was coming maybe next time but all in all it was good Thanks
3,Zzzzzzzzzzz,"Not what I axpected at all . the story line was not all that great and the affects ... ehhhhhh, don't waste your money . I am a big Cage fan but not with this one"
2,ghost rider 2,Not near as good as the first movie but ok kids love ghost rider so had to buy this one too.
2,Disappointed,"Not as good as the first one, even in 3D. It is O.K., Liked the first one better, more action"
3,Ghost Rider,"Didn't like how this movie portrays the Ghost Rider. He seems like a totally different person. Maybe that enough time has passed, that he seemed strange, and looked stranger, meaner. This is just an ok movie."
2,This movie is a waste of time!!,This film has no action in it.Its talk talk and more talk.The producer need his butt whipped!! The first one is waaaaaayyy better then this story.
2,Just a bad movie,"This wasn't even as good as the first one and it wasn't that good either, this movie had bad acting no surprise there, but the visual were very very bad, the movie just had nothing really good about it."
3,VENGEANCE,"THE MOVIE WAS OK ! THE 1ST ON WAS MORE BETTER AND BETTER ACTION.THIS ONE WAS A LITTLE OFF TO ME, ACTION WAS A C- JUST WAIT UNTIL IT GOES ON SALE NOT WORTH $20.00 DOLLARS AT ALL."
2,Puzzled,This is a great gift for my dad but I noticed that the Bluray was enclosed but the advertised Ultraviolet Digital copy was not. Apparently there was a disconnect between the advertisement and the factual item.
3,Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengenance,"Still have not watched it so I honestly cannot rate the movie, but I loved the first one so I am sure this one will be great."
1,PEEEE-YEEEEW What a stinker!!!!!,I swear you could even see it in Cage's eyes as he acted that he was ashamed of this stinker. Urinating jokes...really? A plot that has been done a million times. Innocent kid with a legacy of dark powers that the evil guys want to capture to kill and take his powers. Give me a break.
3,love Nicolas Cage,"Its just a fun movie, great to pass an afternoon on the couch with your best friend. plus Nicolas Cage is always good to look at."
1,"Dear God, why?","If you are looking for a sequel to the first Ghost Rider, you are in the wrong place. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with the first one; the only character that was carried over was Johnny, and even then they completely rewrote his personality. This movie has no storyline, no character development and in no way, whatsoever, does it live up to the first Ghost Rider. Do not waste your time or money losing brain cells watching this piece of trash movie. Just re-watch Ghost Rider 1."
1,My worst movie purchase in life,"This has to be the absolute worst adaptation of a comic movie known to man. I don't who in the world would finance such a travesty. The direction is a total joke and all over the place. If I could give it zero stars that's what it'd receive. But I really should have known it was a bomb from the packaging. It clearly states on the bottom of the cover ""From the Guys that brought you Crank"". Nobody even wants their name associated with it."
3,Disc quality great. Movie not so good.,Condition and quality of the disc was great. The movie itself wasn't very good. Definitely not worth buying in 3d.
1,Just terrible..,"I bought this movie in 3D knowing the movie itself would be bad, but hoping for some neat 3D shots. But no, this movie is just all around awful and should never have been made. And this is coming from someone who actually enjoyed the first Ghost Rider."
1,Pretty Sad,Watch this with my grandson who wanted to see it. No comparison to first one. Save your money and watch another movie.
1,dont waste your money !!!!!,"Man...Big Nick Cage must've needed to make a house payment!!! Terrible,boring plot,and terrible 3d adds up to one terrible movie.If you own 3d tv,etc,take a chance on another movie,read 3d reviews and take a chance.DONT waste your money on this stinker !!"
1,What a waste of time,Seriously - I thought this movie was a total joke! The first one was so good. How can this even be a serious movie - I was laughing the whole time - the acting was SO HORRIFIC loll...just thinking about it is making me laugh. What the heck has happened to Nicolas Cage? wow... I want my time back lol
2,Ghostrider 2 burns out,I can see why the most popular positive ratings rater enjoyed it.. as he says he is 16 if you are older than that you will probably not really care for this film as it's a sequel that has changed the previous movies backstory. It's not a reboot they just opted to change things like the original deal on how he was cursed and a few other things. The story was fairly boring as was the majority of the film. Even the CG had been cheaply done it seemed in comparison to the first film.
1,ghost Rider Sprit of veng,"I was disappointed, The first Ghost Rider was a 4 star movie much better actors than the second movie I would think that Nicolis would have chosen a better movie to act in.."
1,WHAT A HORRIBLE MOVIE AND CRAPPY 3D,"I MUST SAY IM NOT A BIG CAGE FAN BC HE CANT ACT BUT I DID ENJOY HIM IN THE FIRST GHOST RIDER, I WAS SURPRISED HE CAME BACK TO DO GHOST RIDER 2, I WENT TO THE MOVIES AND SAW IT IN IMAX 3D AND BOY FROM BEGINNING TO END THIS MOVIE WAS SO BAD, EVERYTHING BOUT THIS MOVIE FROM 3D TO ACTING AND STORY LINE WAS SOOO BAD, ITS NOTHING LIKE THE FIRST ONE AND IT MITE HAVE BEEN BETTER IF THEY DIDNT HAVE CAGE PLAY THE RIDER AGAIN, THE STORY IS ALL OVER, THE FIGHT SCREENS ARE HORRIBLE AND THERES NO POP IN THE 3D AND THE DEPTH IS HORRIBLE TO, I WOULD DEFF STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE BUT LIKE ME AND SO MANY OTHERS U WILL JUST HAVE TO FIND OUT FOR YOURSELF"
4,Entertaining but no award winner,Entertaining but no award winner. I enjoyed the movie as a good waste of time but I am sure some people will want more a long the lines of a plot.
3,Product detail that amazon didn't knew,"A few months ago I contacted Amazon to give more info about this title, I'm from Mexico and I wasn't sure if this title had the 3D version and the 2D version...well amazon only told me that it was only the 3D, but I found out that this title comes with the 2 versions, (and it also comes with spanish subtitles).This comment is for us the costumers to tell amazon that they should put all of the product details that comes in the back of the case in DVD's and Bluray's."
2,Disappointing,"I enjoyed the first Ghost Rider movie and was excited to see this one.I was disappointed. This movie had a poor story, no character development and poor acting. It did not draw me in and hold my interest and I found my attention wandering throughout the movie. The special effects were well done, but they couldn't carry the show."
2,sucked for the 2nd movie (first was miles ahead),"This movie sucked compared to the first one. The bike was junk compared to the fist one (when transformed). The special affects looked like something from 10 yrs ago. The plot was semi silly, the primary bad guy with the power of rot was stupid. I wasted 2hrs of my life I can't get back watching this film, do not recommend unless you have absolutely nothing else to do for 2hrs."
4,Good movie,"Oh ye of little faith, u had to watch the movie to appreciate it. Enjoyed it very much, i recommend some excitement for ur day ."
2,It's just not good,"I was waiting for this to come out to watch and I wanted to buy it before it came available for rent and I'm glad I did not. I love Nic Cage but the story, the movie, everything in this movie is not up the expectations I had from the first one. And I have to say the first one was better, way better. Make of it what you want, but for all the fans of Nic Cage I would recommend to rent this and than decide if this is the kind of movie you want to spend your money on to have it in your movie library. Two stars are only because I really like Cage. But otherwise would give it one star."
2,not worth it,"I`m glad I didnt go to the theater to watch this. Graphics ok, but the first one was better. Needs a better plot, and a better producer."
3,Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy) [Blu-ray],I would recommend waiting to rent this before purchasing as I don't see myself ever watching this again. Could have been ok but Nicolas Cage outdid himself in bad acting.
1,Not as good as the first Ghostrider,"I didn't like this one, the filming looked really cheap, like a second-hand C-rated movie. The first Ghostrider had enough action to showcase Ghostrider, but in this movie, it just wasn't the same. This movie didn't seem as menacing, and kind of tame, with weak flames. I didn't like it at all."
3,Was hoping for better this time around,"I'll give it 3 stars just because I love the Ghost Rider character in general but these movies have been such a let down. They have SO much potential with all the cool story lines from the comics and how cool Ghost Rider is in general but the movies are plain and simple a flop... so disappointing as I feel they have the potential to be one of the best comic book movies out there. I was hoping the first movie was just a character build up and that the second one would hit the mark but it fails even bigger. Nicholas Cage should be ashamed to call himself an actor... felt like I was watching a C rated movie if there was such a thing.. I'm actually not sure what I actually just watched to be honest.Get a new cast, a new director and please make Ghost Rider the way it should be... done right."
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"This movie is, to put it nicely, very disappointing. The plot stinks, The acting stinks... It's an absolute hot mess. I would rather gouge out my eyes with a rusty grapefruit spoon than watch this schlock again!!"
1,one of the worst movies I've ever seen!,"Don't waste your time. The first movie was maybe a 2 star movie at best, and had the chance to be great, this one was a glorified turd that should have gone straight to DVD and not been wasted on a bluray disk. If there was a way to get back that 2 hours and 5 bucks I would."
2,Not worth the price,"We are using this book, believe it or not, as a required text in an intermediate level French course. I would not recommend it. Almost everything in this book is simply common sense. The information is too general to be useful - it would be much more helpful simply to learn about the language you are studying. The writing is rather simplistic. The only people who might find it useful are those who have never studied a foreign language. If you are already learning one, you know everything in this book that applies to you."
1,not much content,"Did you already know that:--it is worthwhile to practice a foreign language with native speakers?--audiovisual materials could help you?--foreign language dictionaries could help you?--a foreign language varies from region to region?--customs differ from one culture to another?--one should be sensitive to non-verbal cues?--there are formal and informal forms in some languages?If so, then you probably won't learn much from this book."
4,Kravitz rules,"Lenny is the man...so what if he likes prince the beatles and sly? Who doesnt? And no one else emulates their style so accurately as Kravitz, so whats the big deal? He is allowed to do what he does and he will sell for a long time to come...."
4,true to his multi-cultural origins,"on this cd lenny has something for everyone, his soothing ballad style and his Lennon-Hendrixesque wild side are also blended with soul. As Lenny is true to himself, he has great ability toentertain all those true devotees of rock."
5,truth,"this album is a rare example of timeless truths expressed in a modern day format...mr.kravitz is an extremely gifted man, playing almost all instruments on all of his albums and writing all songs, etc...the music is extremely tight, amazing and diverse and, the best example of a rare and beautiful thing these days...conscious music...listen to his words...thank you lenny"
5,Lenny Kravitz rocks,I think that Lenny Kravitz is an awesome rocker. This isn't his best album but it really good though. He has a 70's type of sound combined with the music of today. It's really cool.
4,A must for baseball fans!,"The highlight of this release is TOUCHING ALL BASES (1939). It's an overview of the American League sponsored by Kellogs. It features Joe Cronin of the Red Sox interacting with a group of sandlot kids, the 1939 HOF induction ceremony featuring Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb, and a number of how-two segments on each part of the game including Frank Crosetti & Joe Coleman turning a double play, Bill Dickey playing catcher, and so on. Lots for fans of Ohio baseball with an American Legion game in Akron, Nap Lajoie and Tris Speaker post-HOF induction, the first night game at Cleveland Stadium, and the 1939 WS between the Yankees and Reds. A handful of other shorts as well. The source material shows its age, but it's a good transfer and very watchable."
3,Outstanding with a major flaw,Pentax 20x60 Zoom Eyepiece has outstanding optics allowing for low light and difficult (smoke for forest fires) conditions. Was able to pick out fine details in low light at great distances. Smoke obscured some viewing during testing. The biggest problem with this eye piece is eye relief which was minimal at low power and non existent at high power. No chance of wearing glasses while using this item. This is an absolute killer for me.
3,A book for boys but not just them,"I think is a good book to read for kids 'cause help them think about a good and pure world, but is also useful for an adult reader who is interested in the social Italain situation at the end of the 19th century, 'cause Coure was write as civileducation book for the youngest Italian generation of the time. It had to be an exmple of virtues taht Italians had to have. Is a social fairy tale as Pinoccchio, but these last is more universal."
5,We Love Rescue Heroes,"This toy has been a great addition to our Rescue Heroes family. My 4 1/2 year old son loves shooting the water out over and over again. Plus it is a great toy to take along for entertainment (I would recommend against church or restaurants since he does have projectiles).Be warned, it is easy to lose track of the projectiles. We have instituted a policy of putting them back in immediately after shooting them so as not to lose them.All in all, we love this toy."
4,Great idea that never followed through,"Roberts and Marshall began their text with the wonderful intention of looking to Christianity's roots to determine how church should be carried out now. Their descriptions of early practice and the focused yet free nature of the early church were riveting and compelling. Unfortunately, they never seemed to get off the ground. They were both critical of making formulas for church success, and in this case seemed to eschew all practical advice for more esoteric and inconclusive musings.If you are looking for an interesting book to present an opposing worldview to normalcy in Chistianity this is a great book, but if you are looking for application look elsewhere or be prepared to do the work yourself."
2,Another anceint future book,"Wes Roberts and Glen Marshall have written a book that takes the leap of faith, but unfortunately it misses. There is no doubt that these two authors genuinely desire authenticity within the Church and in its leaders. They write with an almost prophetic style calling the Church to reflect on its heritage and to consider where it is going and they desire some wholesale changes within the Church. While I agree with the authors that authenticity and character is needed I reject the idea that the Church is institutionalized and therefore crippled or spiritually bankrupt. Furthermore, it is not enough to simply point out what is wrong and what needs to change if you do not supply some practical wisdom on how to create change. In the end this is a book that offers a lot of finger pointing and assigning of blame without offering any real hope for a stronger more effective Church."
5,This is a Compelling Book,"Original Intent will encourage, challenge, and inspire you. If you wrestle with how to serve in a culture where the church is now on the margin of society, this book will lay out for you an approach based upon the much older ways of the apostles. Whatever size ministry you are in, this is a great book for leaders and staff to read to remind them of ""first principles"" and how to minister in a postmodern world. Get it."
3,Good Conversation Starter for Congregations,"Roberts and Marshall have provided the post-modern church a fantastic conversation starter. The issues they bring to light are current and problematic for our congregations. Particularly helpful is the suggestion that we, as Christians in a society that does not value Christian values, refuse to measure success utilizing market place standards and instead develop Biblical standards, thus allowing small congregations to realize their potential for ministry. Unfortunately, conversation starter is all they have provided. We need to be very careful not to turn our conversations into two position issues. There are many proper ways of doing church, not simply two (p22), and perhaps the pieces from several puzzles indeed will work together. After all, they are not our pieces, their God's."
5,"This Book Is For All Kids, But Especially My Sister.","After an 11 year old girl, who attended my son's school, died from leukemia, we sent a copy of this book to the school and purchased one for ourselves. The principal of the school indicated that this book was consistent with the material and teachings they had received in grief counseling. On occasion, my 7 year old son asks questions pertaining to death. Whether they are of concern or curiousity, reading this book brings us such laughter and joy, but most of all insight into the beautiful mystery of life after death. We both feel terriffic when the book ends and he usually wants to read it again."
5,Outdoor One-Light Solar-Powered,"look good, stay lite and easy to install and assemble. Worth the money."
3,Very Similar to Houses,"I thoroughly loved his first residential book ""Houses."" With the amount of work he has done I expected this book to focus on new work but many of the same projects and pictures from the first book were used in this one."
2,Flavor change...unpalatable!,"I have used this product for the past year and was completely satisfied. Mixing it with fruit and juice made for a delicious shake that was perfect during lunch. Recently, however, they have begun using a new vendor and the taste has changed from mildly grassy, which is easily covered up in a smoothie, to very strong mint flavor. This mint flavor is impossible to cover up or combine in a smoothie and makes this product difficult to get past my taste buds. The label shows no changes but the company told me that it was just a different blend from a new vendor...yet the ingredient list is identical. I can't imagine how the ingredient list could not change as the flavor went from no detectable mint to extremely minty. Drinking this product can be likened to drinking toothpaste....not palatable! Shame...maybe they will switch back but for now they have lost my business. I advise you to find another phytofood brand!"
2,Loose the peppermint,"This is a great product that has had the formulation of it altered for some unknown reason. Instead of a natural veggie taste that you would expect from a product called ""green food"", it now tastes like peppermint on steroids. I hope this changes or I will have to find another green food product. Before the peppermint, this product was excellent. My nine year old liked it in her apple juice which was wonderful. Now she won't take it at all and it will not mix well in juice which is how the instructions say to use it. No one really wants peppermint orange juice or peppermint apple juice. Its just weird."
3,Not so great tasting but price is good,I have to mix this with another green drink to get it down. I will not purchase this again due to the taste. I have not noticed a boost in my energy or anything since taking it.
5,great price,I had no luck in finding the correct hubs for my truck. Every auto parts store I went to said they not only did not have them in stock but they couldn't order them either. Those few places that said they could get them wanted $400 for just the hubs alone. Started checking the net and found some but none of those sites came close in price to Amazon.com. Placed my order and received my parts before the date I expected them. Everything fit perfect and my truck is up and back on the road and I saved almost $200 in the process.
5,Another great Kelly Set,"I purchased this for my mother, a collector of these sorts of things and am very happy with the product! Having never seen this doll in stores, I had to check it out. The comes with a total of three different heads, as you can see in the picture, that snap easily into place. She is a large Kelly doll, even larger than the other 'my scene' style dolls Mattel put out before.Overall, I'd recommend this doll to all who love Barbie's. She's a great product."
5,Better than expected,"I needed a tile cutter I could cut 12"" tiles diagonally. The smaller 13"" cutters won't do that task. I bought a different cheaper brand at Home Depot but it wouldn't cut anything. The handle design was wrong and you couldn't apply much pressure on the tile to snap it. I took that one back and with some research decided on this one.My neighbor and I were each doing a small bathroom so he used this Nattco PC1818 first and was amazed at how well it worked. Then a couple weeks later I started my project and had the same experience. Score it once and then snap it! Neither one of us broke one single tile or had any problems and we're both first time tile installers.This tool really doesn't have and precise way to measure where you're cutting (example: I want to cut off 2"") nor does it have a guide for cutting angles, but with a tape measure and some thought it works just fine, especially for the price!"
3,Cutting tiles for mosaic work,I needed to cut thin tiles for mosaic work but unfortunately it did not work well. I which I knew that this tile cutter cutter does not work for thinner tiles. It does work for thicker tiles.
2,Not a straight shot,"I am not happy with this cutter. There is too much play as the arm glides along the guide rails which means you cant rely on getting straight cuts. This is fine when cutting tiles for against a wall but not when cutting tiles that will line up against another. I did a diagonal pattern in my living room which was to be surrounded by a darker tile border. The wobbly cuts look really bad against the border.Whats the use having ""unbreakable handle"" when you cant cut straight.Not happy with this cutter."
2,Poor Quality,I ordered this product after using one just like it that belonged to my stepson. His unit worked great and he has had it for some time. The first one I got had a broken foot. The replacement unit they sent was not assembled very well and mis-cut more often than not. I opted for a third thinking that I would finally get a good unit. The 3rd unit had broken parts that you could hear before removing the unit from the box. Sent it back and will not buy this brand.
2,Can't cut large tiles...,"I bought this cut for 12in tile. It worked ok for the first 3 tiles, then the it couldn't cut properly. The cutting wheel was worn out. After change a new cutting wheel, it still doesn't work... I end up returning it to Amazon."
2,Works well,"I was worried that this cutter would not do what it needed to do since it was so cheap. But it works fine. It did not come with very clear instructions on how to use it. But it is simple enough to figure out. Maybe practice on some scrap pieces first. It worked well for a while, but then the unbreakable handle broke after the 50th tile or so. I have lowered my star rating."
1,"Story of the ""non-breakable"" handle","I initially thought that the Natco 18 in tile cutter would suit my needs and, acccording to my research, it appeared better than a cutter I could purchase locally. About two weeks after it arrived, I finally had a chance to use it while installing tile at my weekend place.All went fairly smooth once the rails were lubricated and we cut five 12x12 tiles without a problem. On the sixth tile, we scored it well and then when ""snapping"" it, the handle of the cutter broke at the point where it attaches to the sliding rail scoring assembly. Examination of the break revealed the statement on the handle itself indicating that it was ""Unbreakable"". It appears that the handle is attached to a pot metal slider and that this weak material failed.Overall, I would not advise anyone to purchase this piece of junk. It's a waste of your money. Doesn't cut tile that well even when not broken.Well anyway, I got five pieces of tile cut before it failed. What a deal!"
1,junk,bought this to cut a few tiles and it broke most of them. had to rent a wet saw to finish the job.
3,"good cutter, butttt","its snaps and cuts, problem is its not a perfect straight cut, has a slight curve in the middle, use this for cuts that don't have to be perfect, faster then a blade and does not chip, only snap cutter i've ever used so can't say if any snap cutters cut a perfectly straight line, but this one does not, but close enough for me, saved me alot of saw time and saw blades..."
4,A Good Read!,"Jim Holden uses the metaphor of the Selling Fox to present ideas that will sharpen the skills of any competitive sales professional. Unlike many sales books, which have a ""supervisory"" voice, written from the perspective of someone who isn't actually battling away on the front lines, Holden writes about the reality of winning and keeping business. Foxes survive and thrive in an environment where another player is always scheming to steal their cheese, not move it. In fact, one unique aspect of this helpful guide is its practical advice on how to set traps for your competitors and take their clients away. That may not fit the rest of Holden's emphasis on integrity - but the law of the jungle is often what makes a sales professional a valued property. Maybe the fox analogy is overdone, but the phrase ""super sales person"" is even more careworn. We from getAbstract strongly recommend this book to those engaged in the noble business of selling, and to those who train them."
3,Basic dentistry,"Although the author has gained some serious credits in the world of equine dentistry, this book does not live up to its expectations. The procedures that are described are not very detailed and lack the current insights in modern dentistry. Albeit this is a good start-up for willing enthusiasts in this field of work, a skilled equine dentist will have no advantage from this book. The most serious problem is that it lack&#7664;s a functional / theoratical backbone from which dentistry has to be performed (i.e. no in depth review of masticatory function and dental balancing)."
3,Good Book for Quick Read and Beginners,"This book is good for a quick read, yet left me a little disconcerted, as the author admits a divorce or two... So, what kind of women do you want to find? This book might help you find a certain type of woman. It seems like a book with a regular-guy bar scene type of target customer. If you are a regular guy who hangs at the bar this book may be perfect for you.Yet, what kind of women do you meet at the bar? Will they stay loyal to you? Are they together people, who last for the long haul? Or how will you treat them, as you may be a drunk who acts without long-term consideration? The ideas in this book may help you, but they didn't inspire me too much. There was some very good information on initial contact. I guess it's a really good book for the beginner."
5,"Being of the female persuasion, I highly recommend this book.","My best friend and I found this book in the garage of the house she and her friends were renting. We read it and had some good laughs over it, but we both loved it and agree that the author definitely knows his stuff. I've recommended it to a couple of guy friends so far. It's very engaging, concisely written, and has a wealth of information. I would recommend it not only to guys who are looking to date, but to any guy who wants to better understand women in general, or to girls who want to learn what exactly guys are watching for."
1,Boring,"I was really disappointed in this book. I found it boring and hard to get through. As one other reviewer said, it's very difficult to like the characters in this book. My advice, don't waste your time reading this."
4,A pretty darn good read,"I usually don't take the time to write reviews of the novels I read. I also usually find a perverse glee in reading negative book reviews (probably because I'm a wannabe author). But I really felt I had to add my opinion to the fray.I thought this book was really enjoyable, well-written and absorbing.Yes, the protagonist is annoyingly focused on her work and unmotherly. I guess I like having to search for the good in characters. Sally, however, was real and fully drawn and was someone I would totally want to befriend.Some of Moody's turns of phrase are still whirling around my little brain.Also, the drama? That's probably what made it a bestseller. People generally eat that sort of thing up. Me, included I guess.A great beach read or anytime read. I really enjoyed this book and I feel badly that some of these reviews are so vitriolic. I think the author is talented."
2,Boring,"I was very excited when I saw this book in the store. I love coming of age stories, especially set in the 60's or 70's. But, this book is just plain boring. My biggest problem is that I find the characters underdeveloped. I did not feel a connection to any of them. I am only a quarter of the way through the book, and I don't think I will finish it. Usually a good book takes me only a couple of days. There isn't much of a storyline either. There is no way this book should be a bestseller!!!!"
2,High hopes that didn't deliver,"The premise of this book is good; college roommates who'd otherwise be unlikely to become friends end up becoming the best of friends. The stages is set for their lives to intertwine throughout every era; careers, men, children, parents, aging, etc. But it doesn't. Moody does go through all stages of their life like you'd expect, but for some reason she chose to tell the story from one perspective (Claire), and most of the story is about the other friend (Sally). Claire always flees her own life to be with Sally. For being a story about two people, it's very one sided. And it's a strange format, being told from one person's perspective (though Claire often tells us what Sally is thinking). I also have to comment that I found the character development of the mothers in this story shallow. They weren't ""bad"" mother's; they didn't abandon or harm their kids or anything, but it just seems like Moody attempted but couldn't characterize mothering very well."
2,I Kept Waiting For It To Get Great.....It Never Did,"I wanted a great ""Best Friends"" book that I could savor and completely enjoy. I wanted to see two women who go through life together and watch their lives intermingle. I wanted to see myself in this book ---- Well, I never did. I couldn't relate to either of these women. I found them selfish and really annoying.... by the end of the book I was so mad I had spent time reading this VERY long book that was really about nothing. Sad and Disappointing....."
1,Not Great but I have seen worse,This book was strange. I didn't think it was that good but I kept reading it and wanted to read it to the end. The writing is not horrible-I have seen worse. Good try Martha. Give it another try on a new novel.
4,I really enjoyed reading this novel.,"Being a working mom I haven't had much time to read for pleasure. Now that school is out and I am off for the summer, I decided to find a nice novel to read at my leisure. I read this book a lot quicker than I had planned because I got so into it. I found it interesting and enjoyable, and I plan on passing it on to my best friend for a nice read. It's true that the ending left me wanting a little more, but I don't really know how else Dr. Moody could have ended a story like this any differently."
2,Depressing,"Eh. I was initially engaged as this fiction story began with 2 college freshman girls who are getting to know each other. As a recent college grad, I could relate to much of the story, but as it progressed through their lives and into their 40's, I kind of lost interest. I did not enjoy reading about families falling apart and dysfunctional lives, there is enough of that in the real world. The story also dragged on with no new developments for a long time. It didn't seem like the characters changed for the better by the end, they just realized that life isn't always what you dream it to be. I would pass, it made me kind of depressed about my girl-frienships."
2,Way too much!,"I really hate to bash a book because I thoroughly enjoy reading, no matter what the subject. And while this book wasn't the absolute worst I've read, it just wasn't any good. There were way too many plots, way too much going on and I kept waiting for it to link together and sink in but it never did. Even the last page was disappointing. I won't give anything away but what the author may have thought as an adequate wrap-up and conclusion of the story was far from. I was just very disappointed. It felt like I was reading a story with no beginning, middle or end...it just went on and on. I wouldn't recommend reading it. There are far better books out there."
3,Best Friends is not the best story of friendship..,"I purchased this book hoping to read about the true bond women have with their friends. 'Best Friends' sounded like the tale of two women and how their friendship evolves and changes through different stages of their lives. Although the book does delve into the friendship between two best friends, Sally and Clare, there is too much emphasis on the external factors in their lives. Both are plagued by multiple marriages and divorces, deaths, children, family members who murder one another and AIDs. 'Best Friends' was definitely not the feel good, friendship-based novel I thought it was. It's not a bad read, but be prepared for a lot of death and overly complicated plots."
1,National Bestseller?,"How did this book become a national bestseller? The only reason I am still reading it, is because I do not have another book to read. The characters are not real, the situation make no sense. Do not waste your time. Do not buy this!"
2,Where's the fun in this friendship?,"Clare flies back and forth to California to see Sally more than she sees her own daughter. The two ""best friends"" never really seem to mesh. I know that these two bear no resemblance to any best friends I know. Clare is self-centered and boring. Sally is just kind of a wishy washy wimp and has no common sense considering she's supposed to be a brainy lawyer.I about gave up on this book half way through. Now I wish I would have."
1,What is this about?,This book took me forever to finish. 5 months to be exact. In that time I finished 2 other books. I still cannot get over the story line or lack there of. Moody is very vague on detail and the storyline is hard to follow.
2,not an original book,I think this author wrote her book after reading Judy Blume's Summer Sisters. The plot is SO not original.
2,Not much there,"Typically, I like reading about women friendships and the bonds we have. However, this story just didn't cut it. The characters were nothing spectacular to make me care about them and continue reading. There wasn't much of a plot and I didn't enjoy reading about pornography and the twisted family dynamics. This book was not the compelling read I was looking forward to although it did pass the time while travelling."
3,Disappointing,"The first half of the book was fun to read and quite engaging. I thought I had picked up by chance the perfect vacation book. Then it started to get ""off the wall"" and the story left the ""easy to relate to"" feel and entered the world of crazy fiction. It was like 2 books in one. So, in other words, I enjoyed the first half and couldn't wait to just finish the rest of the book"
5,Not a book for superficial souls,"I read all the reviews above, and I must say that in order to appreciate this book, you have to have deeper understanding and insight into the lives and choices of the people you care about. That's what this book portrays the best: seeing your friends for what they are, accepting their choices, and respecting their dignity, and understanding that noone's life is perfect, including your own. Above all, this book reminds us how rewarding it can be to give out more than you recieve."
3,Not totally bad and not the best I've ever read,"I have to agree with the review above that say they were dissapointed at the lack of intamacy with the characters. When you think about where they come from, you understand why it lacks. But still, wemen talk, connect and bond on every level when you call yourself a Best Friend. It dissapointed me that Clare and Sally held back so much. At the same time, it did keep my interest and I finished the book. There have been books in the past that I could not even get through."
1,a waste of my time...,"the many typographical errors, unlikable characters, absence of a plot, and the position of putting minorities in stereotypical roles (i.e. gardener, maid, and chauffeur...this bothered me IMMENSELY) caused me to not even finish reading this poor excuse of a book...i will never buy a book from martha moody ever again..."
1,Not any friends I would ever want,"Amazing...that a story can include pornography, heroin addiction, homosexuality, promiscuity, AIDS, and murder (of one's own child no less) and still be dull! All of these depressing, ugly sub-plots must be an attempt to mask the fact that there is little substance to the plot and the characters are boring. There isn't a single likeable character in the entire novel. A more apt title would be Misery Loves Company."
1,"Should be titled ""245 pages too long""","I always make it a habit to read a book and pass it on, never expecting it to be returned. My book is in the pocket of a plane in Paris, hopefully waiting to be thrown out. I read, and read, and read, with my expectations never being met. The book was shallow, unbelievable, and way too long. She could have given her message in the first 100 pages, because there was no message. I think that she needs to write journals in the areas that this doctor is familiar. She should stay out of our ""fiction"" world."
2,"I wanted to like this, but found it slow and boring","I honestly thought this would be a great read - my best friends are my room-mates from college, and it is now 20 years later, we all live within 5 miles of each other, and as the years go by, we get closer than sisters. This book i found to be slow - the 'big secrets' were obvious or not really very ineresting- the main 'best friends' in the book seemed to be sad, lonely and not very likable. The dysfunction of thier families was not something that really made them intersting or tragic, just blahhhhh... I had to struggle through this book, it seemed to drag on and on, and the trips to los angeles just more and more boring and uneventful. The friendship did not seem to be balanced, and there did not seem to be a strong bond between the two women, they were just so different and selfish. I was not thrilled with this, i would recommend Summer Sisters, that was a much better read."
2,Cavalcade of Wasted Lives,"A well-written book that gets off to a great start but quickly dissolves into a bleak and meandering cavalcade of lives wasted and destroyed. Way too depressing for me. Like other readers, I was ultimately sorry I spent the time reading it. But if you don't mind bleak and depressing, the author does write well, so you might enjoy it."
2,Did these two characters EVER grow up?,"Claire and Sally went from teenagers to 40ish and still had the same issues, still had the same problems, still acted the same, and still treated people and each other the same. THEY NEVER GREW UP. My reading group chose this book and most of us had the same opinion after we read it: Why did the author keep throwing conflicts at the two main characters if she wasn't going to let them learn and change?With so much conflict going on, you'd think one of them would learn something, but with dysfunctional families, embezzlement, pornography, drugs, homosexuality, promiscuity, divorce, suicide, murder, having babies, abandonment, and adultery, these girls manage to stay the same, immature and self centered.Amazing."
2,This book was a national bestseller!,"This is basically a ""coming-of-age"" story. So to speak. It's about two women who meet in college in the 70's and become best friends. It's told through the eyes of Clare Mann. It follows Clare's friendship with Sally from college to the present. There's no plot. It's just a long and at times boring story about their friendship through the years. Had I been Clare I'd have dumped Sally like a hot rock after about the second visit to California to visit her. Sally never goes to Ohio to visit Clare. Some best friend! All Sally does is whine to Clare all the time. I don't even know why I finished this book. I guess I wanted to see how many kids Sally wound up having, and if Clare would ever tell Sally what actually happened to her brother, Ben. I couldn't help but notice this is the author's first novel and she's a physican in Dayton, Ohio. I think Martha Moody should stick with her day job."
2,Did not hold my attention,This book had too much going on and I was anxious to be done with it. Its story lines were never developed to really grab my attention. I would not reccommend this book to anyone.
4,Seems to have worked,"My deck was brittle and splintered in areas. I sanded the deck, swept it, and ran a vac over it. I used a half gallon of this deck wash (which I wanted because I did not want to use harsh chemicals as I have a well system) and mixed it with 4 gals of tap water in a sprayer, and it appears to have worked. I soaked the entire deck (approx 12 X 16 ft) with this wash, and then rinsed it good with a garden hose. My deck has been drying for about 4 days, and it's smooth and ready for a good coat or two of finish. I bought two gals of this wash and may use 1.5 galsI have left to do the house."
5,Elizabeth's Secret Diary,"This is Elizabeth's Secret Diary features books #23-#31. I liked it except for the very beginging when she was so mopey about Todd, and then she turned into a serial dater practically overnight! Weird, but I guess everyone deals with emotions differently. I liked how Liz was always trying to do the right thing."
5,GREAT,WATCHED THIS MOVIE THE OTHER NIGHT. IT WAS REALLT GREAT. MY HUSBAND WAS SURPRISED AT CHRISTMAS WHEN HE GOT IT. I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR A LONG TIME FOR THIS MOVIE. PRICE WAS NOT TOO BAD. A LITTLE MORE THEN I USUALLY PAY.
5,Rare find,Very happy with the order. Was expensive but was worth it. Just what we were looking for. Rare movie.
5,"Warner, wake up!! It's time for Yellowstone Kelly on DVD","Like a lot of other folks out there who have great taste in western's, this is treasure that should be in everyones collection. Clint Walker desreves much more recognition than he has received. This gentle giant was absolutely brilliant in the way he portrayed his roles, making each one of them believeable and added his own brand of thoughness. Yellowstone Kelly is unforgetable with it's scenery, story line, Indians, honor, and love. It would be a shame to lose this classic to a potential audience of young people, as well as, those of us who already appreciate it.In this generation of Space Vader's, Horror flicks, Teenage Sex Movies, Idiotic Comedies, and awful remakes, I would much rather purchase the old classics like Yellowstone Kelly to watch at home.Warner, please get this released on DVD soon."
3,ReMastered DVD?,"The picture quality is ok on this so called remastered dvd, i was expecting a little better, the colours seemed quite dark to me"
1,Warner Bros Insult to Classic dvd Fans,"This is undoubtedly Clint Walker's best film with a host of impressive supporting actors, breathtaking wide screen Technicolor cinematography and a powerful score, but all of that is lost in the seedy letterbox reproduction of this movie. Visual composition of this ""remastered"" classic is so poor that it looks like a VHS tape captured from a TV set with aluminum foil flapping from the antenna. I've purchased other films from the Warner Bros Archives Collection which were also poorly reproduced, but this one is by far the worst. I'd classify it as unwatchable. My advice to interested buyers is to wait until a quality, wide screen dvd version of this outstanding motion picture is available."
5,"Every Mom and Dad should read this book, it's a perfect guide, very inspirirational, thank you!",Love these books! Reading them made me feel as though she was with me guiding me to spend quality time with my daughter. It is so very rewarding finding a good book and reading it with my 12 almost 13 year old daughter. Even her friends when they sleep over ask me to read to them one of the many books we read together. These books have given me great memories and a life I wouldn't have had otherwise. Enjoy!
1,50 samples of well-aged cheese!,"Has a few OK horror flicks but it's mostly cheesy ""B-rated"" (or lower) horror movies of years past. Quality-wise, the transfer from film to DVD is terrible!"
4,You Get What You Pay For!,"50 Horror Classics have been compiled in many different releases with different titles on each. This release is the version that was on a TV ad in the early 2000's with a number to call to order it. It is the best version, but probably 20 out of the 50 films on here are not that good. Highlights include: Night of the Living Dead, Satanic Rites of Dracula, Nosferatu, Eaten Alive (watch out as the ending has been omitted), The Brain That Wouldn't Die, House on Haunted Hill, Dimentia, The Devil's Hand, Carnival of Lost Souls, I Bury the Living, White Zombie, Maniac, Count Dracula and his Vampire Brides and Last Man On Earth. This set is worth buying for these films at least. The DVD transfer is great on some films and terribly pixilated on other films. Not the best quality, but worth it for the films I mentioned!"
3,Brandon Dickson,I received my product in a timely manner and they were in very good condition and the price was just right.
2,"""Based on"" a true story",Too much speculation and dramatic detail of conjectured events. The Escott book is MUCH better.
3,Hard to Believe the Author,"Undoubtedly, the author hs done a lot of research, but many of the details in this biography have to be fictionalized like quotes from long conversations between Williams and somebody when nobody else, much less the author was present. That said, it is a interesting though at times redundant read. I mean, how many times did the author need to mention yet one more Williams' drinking disaster. The author paints a pretty dismal and dark picture of Williams and also the two major women in his life, his first wife and his mother. Boy, talk about women from Hell. Those two would have driven anyone to drink. Williams himself comes across as a not particularly likeable person. The author points out that it was only after his death that many of his colleagues decided they really did love ""Ole Hank"". We still play his songs, but I think based on this bio, I'll play them with somewhat less fervor than before."
5,Best knife ever!,"I use this knife every day, dozens of times a day..for everything! Superior quality. I will order the 8"" chef's knife the second it goes on sale, too!"
3,Not all it's made out to be,"Being a fan of Japanese cutlery I ordered this knife from Amazon because the price seemed to be a giveaway. Aesthetically speaking, the knife simply looks gorgeous and seems to have all the bells and whistles: all steel, NSF approved, damascus steel, etc...Upon receiving the knife and holding it for the first time I was dissapointed. Shun weighted this razor sharp, hair splitting knife in the all steel handle, making it surprisingly unbalanced, and creating a potentially hazardous knife. I am returning this knife and getiing a refund. 3 stars for the good looks and sharpness."
3,Didn't recieve this product,"So I thought I found a great deal on this volleyball court. Unfortunately thanks to amazon had merged the volleyball listing from one store and an eraser package from another store into one listing. Picture of the Volleyball court, price of the erasers. The Eraser store was great though and called me right away explaining the mishap. So much for an awesome deal. Come on Amazon get your stuff together and don't tease me like this! But this product looks amazing maybe when I actually have 400 bucks laying around I'll get one."
5,My 3-year old loves this book,"I don't know what it is about this book, but my 3-year old loves it, to the point of crying hysterically when I accidentally returned it to the library recently and a little girl took it home instead, and my son couldn't have it. Disregard the naysayers. I'm now buying the book, so we will always have it on hand. The colors are bright and bold, and the story follows the process of preparing a garden, planting seeds and seedlings, watering the garden, weeding, picking vegetables, and finally cutting things up and making soup. My son loves all things outdoors (leaves, pinecones, rocks, etc.) and he adores this book."
4,Good Book for Small Children - a review of Growing Veg. Soup,"This book has gotten good reviews by others but I am a little less enthusiastic about it.Certainly I love the concept of teaching about gardening and how food makes it's way from the soil to our plates; but the artwork, I think, gets in the way of making this a superior 5-Star text.For example, the abstract art [bold and attractive] is okay for demonstrating seeds sitting in the soil, but it is not very good for actually showing what a squash blossom looks like. For all you can tell, it's a open tulip on a vine. Likewise the corn is shown as being orange instead of yellow.Four Stars. This book gives children an idea of how food goes from the ground to the bowl, but if you are looking for a book that will give your young child an accurate picture of what growing veggies look like, you'll have to keep searching."
4,A Preschool-Level Introduction to Vegetable Gardening,"This simple story introduces children to the basic growing cycle of garden vegetables. It opens with a child narrator stating, ""Dad says we're going to grow vegetable soup."" The narrator then explains in simple terms how the family goes about cultivating their vegetables, from planting to harvest. Ehlert illustrates each step with her characteristic collage-style art, more abstract than some of her other work. This is a great introduction to the joy of gardening, and the fact that this garden is a family project, culminating in a shared meal of soup, imbues the story with relational warmth.With its predictable, simple text and visual warmth, this is a great preschooler read-aloud. It may also be enjoyed by early readers, although they might need help reading the names of vegetables."
2,such a nice idea but thoroughly cluttered book too busy,a nice idea but the book is so cluttered its utterly confusing. neither of my kids liked it and frankly i really disliked it. i dont appreciate many of the drawings either.
5,My son's favorite book!!!,"We first saw this book at the California Academy of Science in their Children's Cove. He wanted me to read it every time we were there. He loves the colors, the way things are labeled so he can ask me what they are a practice the words and he especially loves naming the vegetables (I'm a professional cook, so it's a common interest to both of us). He's always been a good eater, but now he ESPECIALLY loves to eat vegetable soup for dinner! Yay Lois Ehlert!"
5,Wonderful,Everything about this book is great. The illustrations are bright and geometric. The story is engaging and fun. A wonderful book for ages one to four.
2,Snoozin with the tooz,"If you want insight on the Tooz, read Kenny Stablers' book instead. He says more in one chapter than Tooz did in his whole book."
4,Excellent source of tasks to be applied in the doctor's office!,This book is an important guide who will assist the interested parties in identifying and to choose strategies for the stress management.
5,Fantastic for cinnamon rolls,I make cinnamon rolls at least once a week on the average. SO I find that weather I am making cinnamon rolls or sticky buns this product works great! I give it 8 stars but five is as high as I can go.
3,1 out of 4 broke,"Bought 4, 1 broke first time I cranked it closed. It was solid as advertised but obviously too brittle for intended use. Other 3 have functioned over several uses without issue."
5,Motivation to get your butt outside!,"This movie was alot of fun. It's really interesting to watch the different teams and all the crazy bushwacking stuff they go through. Motivated me to do a mountain bike, kayak, trail run triathlon."
1,Customer Service From Baby Age,"I ordered this table from BabyAge on 3/2/07. As of 4/3/07, I finally had to call and cancel the order since we had not received it. Prior to the cancelation, I waited three weeks and then made two phone calls to customer service. They promised to send me a shipping number, which I never got. I gave up. BabyAge never contacted me about the delay they had in the supplier and I had to contact them. They were not willing to compensate me for the length of time and trouble. I was so excited to get this table and it had said it would ship in 5-7 days. I was so disappointed and am trying to find another store to purchase a table, one with better customer service."
2,Imagining a New Planetary Order for Humanity,"Once upon a time, from his perch acorss the street from the UN, Donald Keys was pursuing an interesting train of thought: how to rearrange the human being, and with it the planetary system of warring states, which we had come to know as ""the way things are"". This man was a dreamer, and though he tried mightily to bring a practical focus to his work, the most practical he got was in this book. There are some interesting ideas, but he was in no position to do more than propound them in words. His imaginings were intriguiing to small clique of people who followed his writings as they streamed out of his non-profit, Planetary Citizenns Inc, now defunct."
4,Tall child,"This seat is an inexpensive remedy for parents of older kids that are required to use booster seats. I have a 5yr old that is 4'1"" tall and 50 lbs. She is required to be in a booster seat and this seat works well for her."
4,Great big kid carseat!,"My son loves his big kid booster seat. He is 3 years old and 39 lbs, so he needed to move out of his convertible carseat soon. Since your child will be belted in with the car's seatbelt, not a carseat harness, the child must be mature enough to keep the seatbelt buckled and to sit well in the seat. At first my son had some trouble getting comfortable when falling asleep, but now I just keep his blanket or a pillow available. Overall a great affordable carseat."
2,not safe for 30 pound children,"Althought this booster seat is affordable, it is not the safest for my child.....i have a 3 year old daughter who is 33 pounds and 38 inches. This carseat says this is for 30 pound children. i have recently found out this is not a safe weight to be in a booster seat (40 pounds being the minimum weight limit.) I think it is false advertising. Now I have to go and get another carseat.Its too bad my daughter loved this carseat but I should have know when she was getting in and out of her carseat while driving, that it just had to go"
2,Not so good...,Cubanismo is much better.This album is mostly boring; the better tracks are #2 El Niche & #7 All the things you are. Rodriguez's previous 'Cuba Linda' is better.This is not worth the money; get Cubanismo's 'Reencarnacion.'
2,Not recommended,"I bought this book as I was looking for some motivation and training tips to run another marathon. Unfortunately, this book has failed in both respects. While some of the tips might be useful for people who have never taken part in any type of physical activity before, I would guess that these people would only benefit from small sections of this book.The author clearly has a great deal of knowledge and experience, but unfortunately this is not passed onto the reader as effectively as it could have been."
5,good pain reduction,"It is wonderful to have pads that are twice the size of my previous ones. I use my tens unit primarily on my lower back, almost over my kidneys. Chiropractic treatment 3 times monthly is not enough to keep the pain from my Fibromyalgia and Osteoarthritis at bay. I utilize my Rx muscle relaxer minimally, mostly at night. These large, reusable pads on my tens unit allow me to numb the pain without making my mind fuzzy."
4,Nice reference and coffee table book.,This is a great book for you Rolex and Omega lovers (as well as other fine Swiss watches). It covers only Swiss wristwatches but it does a nice job of it. Lots of black and white (as well as some color) close ups of faces and movements. There is a table to tell the approximate range of years when specific caliber movements were produced. I'm certainly not an expert but I would recommend this book for those who are getting into the hobby of collecting fine Swiss automatic movement (self-winding) watches.P.S. Look elsewhere for information on modern quartz or early manual winding watches. If you like bumper and/or full rotor automatic winding wristwatches then this book is for you.
2,For The Irish Catholic,"If you are not Catholic this book is not for you. With so many breautiful pictures of Ireland, the photography was disappointing."
3,"A ""jumping off point"", but certainly not a nuanced account","As with most of the books in the Routledge Critical Thinker's series, this is a means to an end. If you are unfamiliar with the history of philosophy--specifically Zizek's triad of Marx, Hegel, and Lacan--this book will be incredibly helpful as you get your feet under you before approaching Zizek's texts.That being said, this is certainly an oversimplification of Zizek's thought, and many of the summations of key ideas will need to be taken with a grain of salt as the reader approaches the actual works of Zizek.Good for what it does (give you the basic groundwork to make sense of Zizek for yourself), but don't mistake it for any kind of replacement for grappling with Zizek's texts."
3,Western Man,A nice story with characters that you grow to like and find their conflict interesting to follow. Janet Dailey is one of my favorite authors and this story is right there with the rest of her books as a good read.
1,Ugh,"I knew I was getting a quick read with this book, but dear Lord I practically just flipped the pages till I got to the end just to get it over with. It started just fine, but after the main guy got hurt it just went downhill. This was the first book I have read by this author and honestly probably won't read another. Very disappointing :("
2,A Thrill seeing the Whole cast of BsG together again.,"It was a thrill seeing the whole cast (Except Lorne Greene and John Colicos, since they both have passed away -- weep) minus the cast member who protrayed Athena, Including young (back then) Sarah Rush and to keep up with their careers.The Audio quality has everything to be desired though since during the Question and answer period the only parts you could hear and understand were the cast members answers and NOT the Questions from the audience."
5,Neat to see how the actors turned out,Basically show the old cast talking and telling things as the experienced and what they have done since.
3,galacticon review,"not having purchased a dvd like this before was not sure what i had until i played it...as it was, if you like to watch actors talk about their lives since the original series of battlestar galactica, then its a fairly good dvd..."
3,To My Dearest Friends,"After reading the ""rave reviews"" for this book, I tackled it with great anticipation, only to be bitterly disappointed. Volk initiates her introduction of the main characters with disjointed observations by the two ""best friends"" of the deceased, who, ironically, not only don't know each other but also don't know about the secret life led by their ""dearest"" friend before her untimely death. Volk employs excellent command of the English language and injects timely humor, but clearly I missed the excitement generated by this book."
3,An ok read,"I tried to like this book. I had read her other book, Stuffed: Adventures of a Restaurant Family, and enjoyed it. Perhaps that was the problem. I enjoyed the references and the humor in the first book, but was in no mood for it in the second book. I did like the characters for the most part, but it was a little over the top for me. I felt like it was geared toward an older sense of humor, i.e. shmaltzy movies with Whoopi Goldberg or Diane Keaton. I did pass it along to a friend and I am eager to hear what her experience is."
3,Disappointing,"Really loved the beginning of this book, but only one of the two main characters is likeable, and the ending comes as a pie in the face. I think only a New Yorker could begin to care about so many provincial details of types of NY apartments."
2,30 Years Too Late,"Silly Fluff, Only one character is interesting enough to hold your attention. And the ""surprise"" ending would have been interesting if the book had been written 30 years ago. Don't bother///////1."
1,Disappointed,"I can remember in writing class many years ago being told to always try and find something of value in each piece of work we critique. I do not have this book in front of me at this time, but do know that I stated my huge disappointment at the end as this: ""Not recommend to anyone. Possibly one of the worst books I have ever read."" Now, I realize this is harsh and I do not take such words lightly, but if a stranger came up to me in a book store with this book in hand asking my opinion, in fairness I would have to tell them to keep their money and search further for a good read, and I would probably then recommend several. This author probably has the ability to write a really good book. This was not it."
5,Amazing,"Of all of the modern operas I've heard, this is by farthe lovliest. The music is rich, and the story magical.Opera is alive and well."
5,A feast of sounds,"This is wonderful music: Neo-impressionistic, lavishly scored, sumptuous harmonies, vivid orchestral effects, healthy doses of bells and other tinkling sounds, which makes this like a giant watercolour painting, with splashes of colour here and there. Most importantly, there are the beautiful arias. The melodies can really touch the heart. The plot is surreal, with a timeless quality about it, which totally matches with Catan's music. I condemn Naxos for not giving us the complete opera!"
5,A VERY WELL WRITTEN BOOK!,A very well written book! A practical manual for any executive who needs to make decisions based upon reality rather than theory.
3,Not for job seekers,"Although its nice to dream, this book is not for job seekers. Sites like Vaultreports.com seem more appropriate for the rest of us who want to get a great job before taking over a company."
5,The Wind from the Sea,A beautiful tale of romance entertwined with historical events of post revolutionary France. I could not put down this book.
4,Evan is Incomparable...,"From his grass roots here in NC to television & movie soundtracks, Evan keeps going strong. Most of the songs on this CD had me dancing, even if a few seemed recycled. You have to be a fan of pop to really get into some of his cheesy romantic tunes. However, the guitary songs sound great. Keep 'em coming Evan & add back some of that FUNK you used to mix into your music...!"
2,Big gloves or little hands?,"I wear a size 7.5 glove for horseback riding, so I don't necessarily have a small hand. However, even though these gloves were good quality, they fit too loose on my average-sized hands, even after tightening them as snug as I could. When I threw a punch, the gloves 'threw' the punch after me, if that makes sense."
2,Don't fit my little wrists,These gloves are as described and enhance your workout but if you have small wrists they won't fit properly. They also get really sweaty and it becomes difficult and uncomfortable to grip them.
2,One Glove?,"I ordered this item and only one glove was received. upon further inspection the product does say ""glove"" but seriously? why would you only order one glove? and they don't give you the option of choosing either right or left to reinforce the ""one glove"" purchase. Box arrived with actual two glove package open and single glove loose in the packing box. one has to ask why. now i have to either pay for another individual glove to be shipped (and hope i don't get the same hand) or pay for this one to be shipped back. the old saying ""buyer beware"" holds true for this one! read carefully!"
3,Everlast Weighted Gloves,"The one-size-fits-all concept is a misnomer. These are too loose for me and are marginal for my husband. Other than that, they are great."
4,Good quality but to small,The quality on these gloves are good but if you have Large hands then these gloves may not work for you. My fingers don't fit in the attached finger loops.
5,Great product!,"I got ecxactly what I expected. I use this for P90X & P90X2. It adds intensity to an already taxing workout. I recommend it for any cardio workout too. I have medium to large hands, & they fit great. The weight distribution is awesome especially while doing Kenpo moves. Very happy :)"
2,"Has its moment, but basically dull","Reading this book I couldn't help getting the impression that the author was going through the motions with this tale, and struggling to do even that. The plot here is workaday, the characters rather unattractive, and the twists not very twisty. Also there's too much dull information about finance, which really doesn't help. Overall, disappointing."
3,Enjoyable but not realistic,"I found the Market Maker to be an enjoyable diversion but not very believable. It seems unlikely that a new hire like Nick would be assigned to travel to South America after a couple days on the job. Furthermore, the main character's ability to influence high level financiers, escape injury and escape captivity were truly remarkable. Maybe he should have also had X-ray vision. Yet, I found the book hard to put down. Free to Trade was better but the Market Maker served its purpose."
2,Predictable and unexciting,"If you are looking for an exciting book about the world of trading and high finance this is not for you. This is another liberal author portraying success in the business world as evil and selfish. The main character is envious of and wants the fruits of hard work without the effort. Of course, in the world of fiction he ends up getting what he wants."
3,"Ridpath still good, previous books much better","I consider the marketmaker as an average book. The characters were a bit better than in his previous book ""Trading Reality"" but the story wasn't. In addition you can't compare it with his first book ""Free to Trade"" which was a real master piece."
3,Not the same model as pictured.,"If you find halogen worklights as annoying as I do, these are a great improvement.I like to use 2 or more of this model for even light on my finish carpentry projects. (keep in mind that wobblelight makes metal halide lights that can illuminate an entire room for about twice the price of this one.) I ordered a new W.B.jr. from amazon recently and was disappointed with the cheap 6' cord and no power switch."
2,Don't buy it.,"I got the wobble light and immediately tried to set it up. The holes that the screws hold the lamp cover on with were drilled incorrectly. It appears someone tried to fix this problem using a utility knife and it didnt work. I had to re-drill the holes then buy and install different screws, I should not have to do this.The light is bright and lights a very large area. The switch is solid an I have switched it on and off a good few hundred times by now. The bulb has lasted for over two years and still appears very bright and throws off good light. The unit itself is tough and virtually impossible to knock over and when it is the light rights itself and keeps working.For all of it's good points, the light is let down badly by its construction. I am very disappointed in the condition the light arrived in and the time it took to set up. A little more care during construction would have made this light 5 out of 5.Sadly, I still can't I recommend this product after two years ownership."
4,Your dog will love it!,"Arrived in a timely manner. Very impressive thick orthopedic mattress! Our dogs used to spend more time sleeping on mats on the floor than in their crates at night. Once we put the Sleeping Gnome Orthodpedic crate mats in their crates, they sleep all night in their crates instead of wandering around looking for a softer place to sleep! They're happy and that makes us happy, too!Only downside - we had to recently wash one of the mats and followed the washing instructions on the tag, but the zipper tore off during washing and was impossible to repair. That was disappointing and frustrating - especially since we'd followed care instructions to a T."
5,Love them!,My 14-mo old loves them!!! Its a little expensive here than the stores though. Weird because amazon is usually the least expensive.
3,THREE PERSONS IN SEARCH OF MEANING,"Thomas H. Naylor, William H. Willimon, & Magdalena R. NaylorThe Search for Meaning(Nashville, TN: Abingdon Press, 1994) 221 pages(ISBN: 0-687-02586-9; hardcover)(Library of Congress call number: BD435.N39 1994)This book grew out of an interdisciplinary college seminaroffered by the authors: an international economist,a college chaplain, & a psychiatrist.Many of the problems of the world are traced to meaninglessness.The authors do not offer any easy answers,but they do offer some advice on organizingone's life around one's own goals and purposes.The good life is a slight modification of the middle-class way of life.Being is better than having.We can find meaning in love, work, family,and commitment to purposes beyond ourselves.Other books along this same line will be found on the Internet:""Meaning in Life Bibliography"".James Leonard Park, existential philosopher."
1,Wood wick Candle,As much as I liked/loved this particular brand and scent it arrived in the box with the glass broken (very dangerous) and the packing for this glass product was practically non existent. How no one was injured is amazing. I tried to send a photo to Amazon when asked for a review but was unable to do so. The condition was so bad that it was impossible to return this.
4,Freeplay flashlight,"Excellent product, fast shipping, reasonable price. Never have to wonder about batteries. Have used this many times. Great seller"
3,overpriced,"Yes they provide glass which is tempered/tinted however the cloth is not tight and there is still ample road noise that comes into the cabin. Air also enters through the holes where the metal posts attach the upper door to the lower door. Weather seals are good and I haven't experienced leaks, but for $400 I was expecting more. If I didn't need because of a previous break-in where thieves cut my plastic window on the driver side I would be sending these back. Side note this door will work with Sahara although the vehicle verifier only says it works with the SE."
2,Less Opinions Please,"I bought this book based on my satisfaction with Myke's other microprocessor books. This book is clearly worth the price, especially with the CD-ROM full of resources, but it gets a little tiring having to wade through Myke's opinions about the ""weirdness"" of a particular architecture, when you are just looking for facts. Next time Myke, leave out the opinions!"
1,Mother ran out of humor,This should have been two books instead of one. That would have been hard considering the book is so small. At the beginning I loved the book and could identify with many issues. It was nice to look back and laugh. She started it as a funny book about being pregnant and raising children. She should have stopped the book there. I had planned to give it to my daughter who is pregnant now. But then the author went into some very sad situations concerning what happened to her children when they were grown. She could have written a book about how she handled those situations but they did not belong in this book. I will not be passing this book along to my daughter.
5,Humorous Reflections!,Some encounters with your children don't seem too funny until you see Barbara's take on them! She gives a new perspective on what is happening. It is so easy to order books on Amazon.
1,doesn't translate on audio,"while this might be a great read, the humor and timing does not translate to audio. It comes off as a boring narrative."
5,Bar of Soap and Not Liquid Lava Orange,"The picture of this item as a plastic container labeled Lava Orange does not correspond to item offered for sale. A bar of Lava soap (solid) is offered for sale. A liquid form of Lava is not offered despite the picture implying otherwise. Lava as a soap or liquid is superior for its properties in cleaning off organic adhesives. So when you perform jobs where your hands or skin get dirty from adhesives involved in holding tiles in bathroom, grease from car, or adhesive applied to floor tiles, this product helps to clean it off whereas ordinary soap is not effective. Substances that are sticky, guey, greasy, and oily can be effectively cleaned through use of this product."
4,Good Value,"It's not fancy, but for the price its a good value. I find its a little stiff, but the photo quality is fine."
4,Not the best,"Of course, you can't go wrong by reading a Mandie book from Ms. Leppard.But to me, this book did not do any justice of what this author can really create. I found the storyline dull and a little un-interesting, compared to all the other Mandie books I've read.Mandie Shaw recently arrived home from her Europe vacation. School is about to start in a few days, and Mandie decides to visit her Cherokee friends. While she's there, people keep disappearing, and it doesn't look good that there are two men digging all over the Cherokee's mountain.Are the two mysterious scenarios connected?Who will be the one to stop the snooping men?You'll have to read the book to continue Mandie's story."
3,Oh So Boring!,"Mandie is finally home from Europe, and she's paying a quick visit to her Cherokee relatives. But it turns out to be more than a leisurely visit. Her cousin Tisani has disappeared, and strange men are digging on a hillside owned by the Cherokee's.What are they digging for? Will Tisani ever turn up? Find out in this book by Lois Gladys Leppard.I didn't quite get this book. I nearly fell asleep over it; it was so slow going. The plot seemed pretty unrealistic. I think the author was running out of ideas."
2,Not the best Mandie Book,"I didn't even finish this. I don't know if I'll ever read the whole thing. The plot was pretty interesting, but it was not suspenseful at all, and it was just slow-paced and boring. I don't recommend it.-Mikael, age 10"
5,wonderful,Great collection of music -- gave a copy to my sister who is an strings teacher and she was pleased too
5,A Grand Holiday Album,"The reviewer of December 2006 gave an excellent quick summary of this disc's contents, and I second everyone's assertion that this is a wonderful Christmas album to own and to give. Among Messiah, albums of straight carols, and I suppose the various ""Christmas"" concertos of a few composers, it isn't always easy to find quality recordings that utilize traditional holiday music in what could be termed a classical vein. This album smacks that target right in the center. Highly recommended, for this or any other season."
5,Very Best of David Whitfield,"Am I not being honest because I haven't heard the CD yet - however, my husband and I have all the records that David Whitfield had those many years ago and have made tapes of them. WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOREVER for a CD to become available - MORE, MORE, MORE. We feel that David's voice is one of, if not the voice, the very best ever heard. Thanks for the opportunity to purchase this."
5,Oldie but goodie,He was popular when I was in high school and always loved his voice. Glad I found this CD and enjoy it everytime I play it. Very romantic music and lots of emotion.
1,why?,"why is it so hard to get The Very Best Of David Whitfield? I have been trying for many years now,and noone ever has it!"
1,"Humorous, but Worthless","The one star is for charity. With its melodramatic, worst case senario approach to birth and motherhood, this book, which should NOT be referred to as a guide, can scare the hell out of new and expecting moms who are looking for clear cut, reassuring straight talk about first year motherhood. This book belongs in the humor section, not the parenting reference section. Vicki Iovine didn't do any of use a favor by writing this book."
4,"good book, but a little scary on ""bad stuff"" for 1st time mothers","this is a good book for an expecting mom (my wife is due in Feb) but it goes into details about what can go wrong.... it's good in advice and a little scary in the ""bad events"". I'd recommend it to others overall"
2,Read Anne Lamott Instead,"Iovine clearly has some body issues and if you don't have some of your own, you may after reading this so I say skip it and read Anne Lamott's _Operating Instructions: A Memoir of My Son's First Year_ instead--beautiful, funny, sympathetic, hopeful. If I had to choose for a girlfriend between Iovine and Lamott, it's Lamott, hands down and any day of the week."
1,Boring and annoying,"I liked the Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy because I thought it was funny, so I got this one, expecting more of the same. I didn't find it very funny at all!Plus, I disagree with many of her negative views on parenting. Heck, I get frustrated at times like everyone else, but parenting has been a wonderful experience overall. I guess I just couldn't relate to her constant whining. I also found the emphasis on weight loss irritating.Interestingly, I disagreed with some of her views in the Pregnancy Guide, too, but I thought that book was entertaining enough to outweigh the annoyance factor. With this book, I was simply annoyed."
3,Funny but also scary,"I picked this book when I was 7 mos pregnant with my first child. I immediately loved the book. But as I read it I began to grow frightened about the impending birth and also the tribulations she describes in the first year. She's honest, that's true. But there's an edge to her advice and comments that made me feel overwhelmed and freaked out. After a while I had to just put the book away."
2,Pessimistic Projections,"I was very disappointed to discover that a book that was supposed to be funny was actually depressing. For example, the conclusory concept that you WILL be sleep deprived after you have your baby, and there's nothing much you can do about it. Other books discuss techniques for catching sleep - this one says essentially that you should ""grin and bare it.""Another customer review said ""it ruined my day"" and I agree. I wasted a perfectly good day freaking out over how I was going to function without sleep.With so many inspiring books about lovingly beginning one's life as a parent, why spend one's precious (awake?) time on this condescending obnoxious material.Any girlfriends I've ever had that became this overbearing now have a line through their names in my phone book."
4,Girlfriend's Guide,"This book offers insight on pregnancy that only a girlfriend would tell you. This is not medical or to be used as a reference, but to tell you what you are experiencing is normal. Cute book."
2,"Complain, complain, complain!",This book has some funny parts but most of it is just complaining. It seems most of the information is basic stuff that most women already know.
2,Amusing-Kind of Like Reading a Computer Manual by a Computer-Illiterate Person,"I found ""A Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy"" entertaining, so I bought this book after I'd had my first child. Not only does the author not base her childrearing philosophy on biology, psychology, or commone sense, but she ridicules people who do. She boasts about breastfeeding each of her kids less than the one before, which shows a basic lack of understanding of health issues. If you are looking for a humorous slant on infancy, then this might amuse you. If you are looking for a book to base your own parenting on, then don't."
3,Just a warning:,"This book is amusing and light to read, but is only useful for BRAND-NEW mothers. I bought it mistakenly thinking there might be some interesting advice on older-baby topics, such as feeding solids, crawling, walking, etc. (I have a 7-month-old daughter). Unfortunately the bulk of the book deals with the newest of new-motherhood issues--losing your baby weight, how to care for your body in the immediate days after delivery, having sex for the first time post-delivery, breast v. bottle, etc. Only buy this if you are still pregnant, seriously."
4,Iovine strikes again,"With ever-irreverent and witty writing, Vicki Iovine has created another really great book to help women cope with the adjustments motherhood brings. I liked the Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy a lot better than this book, but as a companion, it was pretty good. I especially like her bare-bones honesty about the less pretty side of maternity and childrearing. It's good to have a girlfriend who has been there tell it like it is. I look forward to Surviving the Pre-teen Years, but I bet we'll have to wait on that one a while."
5,Loved It!,"Vicki is a true girlfriend, she tells it like it is. I have all the books on how to take care of your baby, but none on taking care of yourself in this new life you are living. My life has changed a great deal and her words of wisdom really helped me through my tough days and sleepless nights."
5,Another must read...,"After reading ""The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy"" I knew that I had to read this follow up. And I was not disappointed!I love that Vicki Iovine can be so honest...about the good and the bad. Let's face it - motherhood is wonderful and I wouldn't trade it for anything, but it HURTS to give birth and there's a lot of stress the first year! This book kind of helped me along...helped me realize that I was not alone.I am the first of all of my friends to have a baby, and I loved both this book and the first one. It was kind of like I had a ""hidden buddy"" to guide me through the whole process. And while there is some outdated information and things that have changed - I found that true in any pregnancy/mommy book that I read.I really recommend both of these books...2 of my friends are now pregnant and they're both getting this book as a baby shower present!!!"
3,Like a wacky friend you roll your eyes at but love...,"I adore her ""Guide to Pregnancy"" and she figuratively ""held my hand"" through some scary prenatal testing. When all the big ""serious"" tomes were scaring me, I literally underlined Vicki's assurances and read them non-stop for a week.This installment is weaker than the Pregnancy guide but still quite enjoyable. To be frank, Vicki does tend to laugh at some of the parenting choices I hold tantamount - breastfeeding, co-sleeping, etc. -- but she does so from her OWN perspective, not claiming any ""expert"" status to back up her ""not for this girl!"" line of thinking. In that manner Vicki is like a warm, wacky, friend who you have over for coffee and who will say absolutely outlandish things - causing you to say ""oh that Vicki!"" and roll your eyes at her silliness and frame of mind even as you love her for being, well, HER."
3,Disappointed it focuses so much on the first part of the babies life.,I loved their pregnancy book and was so excited when I found this one however I bought it when my son was almost a month and I felt like the majority of the book already didn't apply to me because it was about the birth and right after. While I feel these are important times I think the title of the first year is a bit misleading. Good book but buy it and read it BEFORE you give birth!
5,Practical. Sensible. Humorous.,"This is a book I've read several times because I've not only enjoyed it but have learned a great deal as well. Iovine's writing style is fresh, humorous, and quick-reading material. Her advice is for real moms who are not out to impress but are all about surving the first year of motherhood.Great baby shower gift."
3,Don't take it so seriously!,"I, being of sound mind and body, strongly urge the reader of this book to take her comments about weight and your body lightly. She is NOT a doctor. I don't recommend reading this unless you have already gone through birth. I do find her sense of humor enjoyable and the reading to be fairly easy. I was concerned with her ""spin"" on postpartum depression. She seems to think every woman suffered from it but there is a difference. Depression is a medical disorder where intervention should be sought, not just normal changes in your thought processes. DUH, you just had a baby. She insinuates that this big change in a woman's life is a less than awe-inspiring event. I personally wouldn't change a thing about mine."
5,Must have for all new moms!,"This is an excellent book for all new mothers. It addresses common concerns regarding baby's health and welfare and mom's state of mind with humor and realistic wisdom. This book has none of the preachiness or ""Pollyanna""-ness I found in other baby/child development books. The best thing about this book is that it is true to REAL life. I am so glad I gave in and purchased this book, even though I had bought about six baby/child books already!"
2,Nowhere near as funny as the Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy,"Not a bad book, but not as funny as the pregnancy book. That one made me laugh out loud. Also, I found some of her ""advice"" to be disturbing, and some of it goes against American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations. I know it's just supposed to be a funny book (and it is), but sadly, I've met a few people who take Ms. Iovine's word as gospel and don't bother to do anything other reading. If only parenting books were as easy to read as her books!"
3,First Year..,"This book should be read before you have your baby. The first few chapters are dedicated to labor, hospital, recovery, etc. The rest of the book is just ok. Not as informative or relevant as her first book."
5,A witty must read for new moms,I found this book as well as the Girlfriends Guide To Pregnancy to be very helpful and funny.I love the authers writing style as I found myself laughing out loud many times.You get the feeling that you are not alone in the many doubts and fears that all new moms suffer through.I hope that she writes more books.I love her style!
1,Irresponsible writing,"I'm pregnant and have to say, THANK GOD I knew most of what she says is *highly* exaggerated before I picked up this book. Where ""Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy"" is on the border of being too negative to be helpful, this one is simply irresponsible writing.While the author acknowledges that she's not a doctor, she takes a delicate, highly emotional subject and spins it for the sake of humor. The point she misses, however, is that the approach would work except for the fact that her target audience is a bunch of women WHO DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER. That makes her a bully, in my book. She's a one-trick-pony who finds humor in exploiting the perils of pregnancy. I personally know a lot of women who tell retrospective ""horror"" stories -- the difference is that they understand the difference between yukking it up over a cup of coffee and directing their ""memories"" toward an unknowing group looking for guidance."
3,My Least Favorite of the Girlfriends' Guides,"I loved the Pregnancy Guide, and thanks to a relative who is a bit ahead of me in the baby game, I'd already read the Toddler Guide before this one. I have to say, this one is definitely less amusing and IMO, less helpful. There are some parts of this that were excellent, including a few sections that did make me feel better about myself. This is definitely of less value to an adoptive mother than a bio-mom, though there are still plenty of helpful tips. There is definitely a theme about losing the pregnancy weight that runs through out, but to some people that IS very important.I did NOT feel that she was putting down mothers who have natural childbirth, but rather relieving those who chose not to of the guilt that some people try to put on them.Even though some of the books sounds a bit hostile, I believe you can feel her love for her kids shining through. Hey, childbirth and the first year are hard, and there's nothing wrong with someone saying so!"
1,Negative Attitude,"I really didn't care for this book. I got the impression that she is just miserable. I don't know about others, but I do not take advice from people who are unhappy. Find the people who are happy and positive to take advice from, that is if you want your life to be happy and positive. I enjoy every second of being my baby's mom and can't wait to have my next one."
4,A very truthful - what happens when the baby comes - book,"I very much enjoyed reading this book. I read it from cover to cover in just a few days it was so interesting. I am in my 8th month of pregnancy and after reading this book, I think I was quite naive about what having a baby would be like. But thanks to this book, I know more of what to expect. No, the author is not a doctor, nor does she back up most of her opinions with other resources, however, she will be the first to tell you that. One of the best things about this book is that the author is writing as if she's one of your best friends. And your best friend most likely isn't a doctor, but you can trust what she says really has happened to her and is her personal experience. I gave it 4 stars only for the fact that the author uses bad language occassionally in there, but otherwise it's wonderful. So I truly appreciated the honestly this book gives and recommend it to all first time pregnant women!"
5,Great companion book.,"I loved this book! I bought it a month before the birth of my son, (my first) and it kind of prepared me for what to expect. I didn't read her first book but I plan on buying it and reading it before my next pregnancy as well as recommending it to all my pregnant freinds. Her insite is open and honest and very refreshing. She tells it like it is."
2,"Wise-Maybe, Witty-No","After laughing my way through the Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy, I was disappointed to work my way through this book with hardly a chuckle. Without the wit, this book serves as a guide to the first year of baby's growth and there are many better guides out there. Trusty Dr Spock, or the Sears' guides to infants and babies are much better."
3,Did She Really Say That?,"New motherhood comes with it many pressures. The pressure to take care of a newborn and yourself, for starters. There is also a societal pressure, it seems, as we strive to be the perfect mother. We feel everyone is questioning our every ""mother-move."" Vicki Iovine's book is a help in this regard. Written with honesty and humor, it gives new mothers a glimpse ""behind closed doors"" to the ""real"" world of new motherhood. Knowing that you are not alone is always a help! My favorite part is Iovine's honesty. It is refreshing to hear an opinion, agree or not.It Gets Easier!: And Other Lies We Tell New Mothers"
5,Great book!,"This book is hystercial but true! I loved it so much, I bought it for several friends for gifts!"
3,Entertaining read,"I enjoyed this book. However, I thought it was supposed to deal with the first year, but it mainly focuses on newborns and adjusting to them. Overall, the book was very entertaining."
2,Sarcastic and rude to moms who care,"This book definitely had some funny parts. I smiled and even giggled once or twice. However, the only reason I finished reading this book was because I wanted to see how many times the author could offend me and mock my parenting choices.This book is rude to so many. It is not at all breastfeeding friendly. It is also not conducive to intuitive parenting. She glosses over some important guidelines for babies and moms. If you want a little humor and don't mind a grand dose of sarcasm and belittling, then this is the book for you."
2,a Sorry Sequel,"While I loved her book about pregnancy, this book was a bore.I didn't even finish it."
2,"Disappointing follow-up to ""Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy""","I learned so much from Iovine's first book on pregnancy, and enjoyed reading it so much, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this follow-up. About half-way through I finally stopped forcing myself to read it. It's not nearly as straight-forward, not nearly as entertaining, and not nearly as educational. Instead, try the book ""Baby 411""."
2,somewhat entertaining and some helpful tidbits,"I read this book in my eighth month of pregnancy. At first, I was entertained and relieved to read a lighter-hearted pregnancy book. But by chapter two, I was starting to crave useful information rather than funny anecdotes that usually refer to pop culture and tv (two things that are already overstated in our society thank you very much). By chapter 3, I was annoyed and wishing I had bought one of the other recommended books.Overall, perhaps a fun book for those that want to be entertained but get the facts from another source."
3,Do NOT read while pregnant!,"I cannot stress this enough. Pregnancy, at least the later stages, is anxiety ridden enough to focus this much on the negative aspects of childbirth. Not that the author is trying to pull you down, quite the contrary, but for someone who hasn't yet been through labor, it can be terrifying. My husband actually had to take this book away from me in my 35th week because he didn't like how it was affecting me, I was an anxious wreck.Save this one for AFTER you give birth. You'll be thankful you did."
1,What a crock!,"This book is full of misinformation and personal opinion presented as fact. If she wanted to write a humor book about pregnancy, she should have written one, but she calls this book a ""guide,"" and, god help us, some poor women are probably going to take it that way."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I thought this was the PERFECT gift when I opened it at my baby shower because I just loved The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy, and so did my gift-giver. We really could relate to Vicki and her Girlfriends! However, once I started reading the sequel, it left me VERY disappointed, and like some other reviewers, downright depressed. This book is ideal for the woman who breastfeeds, or the woman that doesn't mind not having sex or getting back into shape. As for the rest of us that choose to bottle feed (HEAVEN FORBID!) and actually enjoy sex (OMG!) and working out(PLEASE do not take her advice and wait 6 months - WHY?!?) don't waste your money on this book. She promotes breastfeeding because she gets orgasms from it - enough said."
5,Every new mom has to read this book,I have bought this book for every friend who was expecting..it gives the most realistic point of view of any of the books on the market.
1,Not at all what you may think it is,"I got this book because I was frantic about my newborn screaming his head off at 3 am and was looking for an antidote to the ""What to Expect..."" book and was sadly dissapointed. This book offers no advice about taking care of the baby, it really deals with taking care of yourself. That may be fine for some, but I still am up now at 3am with no idea what to do for my son and his crying. I returned it. I think it should be listed as a mother's guide to herself rather than a ""baby book"" You would be better off with the Dr Sears books instead if you are looking for baby advice."
5,Don't Leave the Hospital Without IT!,"In this Girlfriend's Edition, Vicky answers the question - You've got a baby living in the house - NOW WHAT!!!. The only problem with this book is that when you need it most - you don't have the time to read it!!!Take it to the Beauty Parlor, take it to the bathroom -whenever your precious little one is sleeping - and you're not - READ IT!!!Its great fun and highly informational!!!I don't know how my kids would have turned out without ""the girlfriends""!"
1,Not my girlfriend either,"I'm sorry I read this book. It made me depressed. I read it before giving birth and my experience was nothing like this book describes. My delivery was easy, my husband is a terrific partner and father, and my girlfriends had the same experiences I had."
2,Depressing!,This book made me depressed. I don't recommend for 1st time mom because it only covers the negative aspect of motherhood.
1,don't read this while you are pregnant,"I read this way too early. It got my pregnancy depression off to an awful start. I am sure it would be better if I read this after having the baby--while up at 3 am, but NOT while still pregnant. I have lived with my darling for 5 months and could never, EVER sit outside the door while she cried. Of course, I can't hire a nanny and moan and groan to my girlfriends about how I haven't lost the weight over morning coffee at the coffee house, but that's because I am a working mom-a teacher in the US. I may be a bit bitter, though. I think we are in such different worlds, I cannot identify with the author in this book."
5,Loved this book!,I disagree with the reviewers that state this book is depressing. It's a dose of reality from women (her and her friends) who have had many children among them and been through a myriad of experiences. Childbirth/motherhood is not always a bed of roses! She brought to light many things that I never would have thought of. (I am thinking specifically about her childcare-search recommendations since we're in that process right now.)
2,Depressing!,"The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy was my life-saver. I absolutely adored that book; it was funny but realistic. So when my due date began to approach, I was thrilled to purchase this book and start reading. Well, what a mistake! This book contains all the ""real dirt"" of baby/motherhood, true. But in this case, I think that too much honesty (or is it too much whining) can be detrimental. The author drones on and on about the negatives (I think there is one up-beat chapter about baby-love) and frankly, I was flat out depressed after every reading session.This book scared me to death and had me convinced (and not in a joking/funny way) that I would not sleep, eat, bathe or leave the house for months after the baby was born, all the while being dressed in stained, ragged clothes while my husband regularly wanted gourmet dinners served on time! Not a pretty picture for a first-time Mom who has no idea what to expect, and who is already feeling scared and vulnerable."
5,couldnt have survived twins without it,"FABULOUS! what else can i say girlfriends? i was NOT lucky enough to have received the girlfriends guide to pregnancy and i must say, i picked this up myself for something to read while breastfeeding. iovine is outright hilarious and reassured me that i can laugh at myself. for those not amused by her humor-stay away, but otherwise, she can make sure that more women are not steeped in the ""postpartumish"" feelings that might befall upon us. it was validating to hear that you would lose things, and immediately after reading that, i lost my engagement ring and the actual book. amazingly enough, when i found the book, i found the ring! i have marked pages for my weary husband to read so that he can understand better that its not just me, that a whole population of women out there are just as crazy as i am. thank you vicki-keep them coming!"
1,Inaccurate portrayal of postpartum life,"I found the majority of the information to be inaccurate through my own personal experiences and also from doctors. I bought this book thinking it would contain good advice and light-hearted humor from a mother who had been through it all. It contained useless drivel based upon just one woman's experience. I agree with the other readers, it was hard to relate to."
2,Great book for moms with lousy husbands and cranky babies,"I bought this book after reading the first book regarding pregnancy. I found the humor amusing, however, I could not relate to much in this book. My husband isn't a total dud and my baby doesn't make me miserable. Maybe if I were married to a clod and had a cranky baby I would have enjoyed this book more. This book can do more harm than good if the reader buys into the theories of postpartum depression and exercise. Read with caution."
4,Just when I needed it!,"I bought this book just before the arrival of our son. The first chapter describes the wreck your body will become after the birth... Yes, it sounds scary, but she gave some excellent, very humorous advice: how to look after yourself, how to handle relatives, etc... the best piece of advice I took with me to the hospital was value the help and the security and the time you receive in that hospital room! With regard to the less pleasant ""stuff"" - I'm just glad I knew what to expect and didn't have any rude surprises.After I brought my beautiful little baby home I had a few weeks of difficulty breastfeeding. And at 3am you do not want to call the hospital or your mother or your friends and say you just want to give up, so it was wonderful to reach for this book and laugh and cry with Vicky and her girlfriends, who had all been there - and survived - it kept me going! Excellent and funny. I didn't find it depressing AT ALL!!!!"
3,"Good, but not great","If you shook with mirth while reading ""Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy,"" you'll get a few similar chortles from this book -- but the fact remains, as other reviewers have noted, that Vicki is not quite as on top of her game in this, her sophomore effort. Also, it's not exactly funny (or refreshing) to read about bone crunching exhaustion when you're bone-crunchingly exhausted. The truly funny bits (and they're in there, though there are fewer of them) can get lost amid the reminders of how hard it is to have an infant around.Assuming you have the time and energy, I think it's a fine read if your baby is still small (I read it when mine was 3-4 weeks) -- just go in with lower expectations and remember that your own sleep deprivation and hormones may impact your enjoyment of it."
1,"Awful, Awful, Awful","I bought this book after using the Girlfriend's Guide to Baby Gear. I was impressed with the book. As a first time mom, the guide was great in a sea of baby items that I didn't have much of a clue about. Saved me lots of time and money.I bought this book used with the expectation that it would be in the same vein as the baby gear guide. I want my $6 and my time back. What a monumental waste of trees and time. This book was so bad that I threw it away-didn't even make the Goodwill pile. She denegrates men to the point you wonder if she's either a hard-core, man-hating lesbian or has *that* terrible of a marriage. With comments like ""of course you'll be the only one watching the baby! Your hubby will be so clueless that you'll want to snatch the baby from him before he can harm it!"" It is heavily laced with mom martyrdome. No thanks.Do not waste your money on this book."
3,Read too late,"This book would have been better if I had read it before I had my son. I had to skip half of it since I didn't read it until he was about a month old. I loved the girlfriend guide to pregnancy, so I thought I would love this. But-- it wasn't very helpful."
1,Expecting Dads &#65533; don&#65533;t get this book!,"For you expecting dads, especially first time dads - DO NOT GET THIS BOOK FOR YOU WIFE. If it shows up at you house, I would suggest it should conveniently disappear into the lost-and-found abyss.It creates far more anxiety than anticipation. To begin with, your wife will be off balance hormonally and will have very understandable fears of pregnancy. This book, while somewhat humorous, takes the most miraculous time of a woman's life and turns it into a miserable, bleak, depressing experience - triggering neurotic thoughts of abandonment, hopelessness, and misery. You will spend most of your time undoing the dour predictions rather than rejoicing in this wondrous time together."
3,"Razor good, cleaning station bad.","I have had this razor for over a year now and it has worked pretty good. As expected, I had to replace the blades after about a year. The cleaning/charging station was another story. It never worked right and is just a piece of junk. It might charge ok most of the time, but the buttons never worked when it was time to start the cleaning cycle. I just pour some of the cleaning solution in a shallow dish and run the razor in it for a few seconds. I wish I had saved some money by not getting it with the cleaning station."
4,Norelco Speed Shaver,"The jet clean shaving system included in the package with this shaver is oversold. The structure if the shaver head is such that it can be easily cleaned with warm water immediately after use, so there appears to be no additional cleaning required. The shaver is quite similar to earlier models of the same type, so very little difference in the quality of the shave has been noted. Placing the battery charging hardware in a plug-in module so that only low voltage is present on the shaver cord is a safety improvement."
2,Built-in process to kill the batteries,"The shave delivered is OK. Probably a bit better than average. After a period of time (the unit decides this and not you) the 'change the blades' light comes on. Until you do this the light stays on, effectively killing the battery life until you buy new blades. When I called Phillips on this they expressed 'surprise' and replaced my razor, but how can this be when others in this review process report the same thing? Phillips really screwed up on this one. Do NOT buy this unit!"
2,WATCH OUT FOR THIS ONE!,"When I first got the Razor, the Jet Cleaner didn't work right out of the box. After contacting Customer Service they never did anything to either replace or repair the Jet Cleaner. The Razor itself works well, however, they do not honor their warrenty and there is no Customer Support to speak of. I suppose thats what you get from third world manufacturing."
4,my first norelco,"I have tried many types of facial hair removal, but i cannot get rid of ingrown hairs without sacrificing a close shave. after the 21 days of skin adjustment, as stateed in the directions, i have a clean shaved face with no bumps. i clean the razor once a week using the solution. i brush the head after every use. i am very happy with this product and it is worth the money. But i did not get a close shave until a couple of weeks after use. So hang in there and follow directions."
3,Cheaper is lighter,"I have the older model, witch is 1/2 pound heavier !!! This newer model is light weight and you can tell in the power of the motor, cutters. The cheap crap made in china, is easy to pick out. This shaver is ok, just don't think it has the power to cut hair in a fast pace. The charger / cleaner is ok. Not worth the extra cash, just get the shaver if you have to replace it."
2,Short Life,"The razor worked fine and did a good job. After about two years it just died. I have no idea what was wrong with it. It would not charge. It would not work with the cord pluged in. No idication what the problem was. I still had my old one, so I threw this one away and have been using the old one (which I have had for over 8 years)which is still going strong. For the money, this one was a waste."
3,Jet Clean is a rip.,"Ok, I'll admit right off that this is not the exact model I had. I had one that was a step lower and is no longer available. Like many reviewers have already said, however, all Norelco razors are nearly identical. The model I had also had this jet clean system, and I do not recommend it. The base in mine had shorted out, and by cleaning the razor everyday, I was also charging it everyday, making battery life less than stellar. If I went to my gf's for the wknd, I had to bring the charger. After about a year, my razor needed new blades [were getting dull, then one fell out and into the toilet]. $30 for new blades or $30 for new razor entirely... I got another cheap Norelco. This time I'll just rinse it under hot water and save $60 a year on the jetclean."
4,Love this shaving system,"just bought the Norleco 8160XLCC jet clean system. Love the shaver for its close shave. This shaver shaves just as close as my old and more expensive 9160 with the adjustable height/contour system. I especiailly like the jet clean system as it really works. The only downside is that after the cleaning cycle ends, the system goes into charge mode which will degrade the batteries if the system is repeatedly charged when not needed. I wish the system would just go to standby vice charge after a clean cycle"
4,Dad never told me about razer burn...,"Love the shaver, but I wasn't prepared for the three weeks of rough, yet sensitive skin due to razer burn. THis shaver doesn't get as close as my disposable razer, but that's a given with shavers, right? I am wondering if my face will toughen up over time, or perhaps I'll have to just slap on some aftershave and take it like a man. In a perfect world, I would've given this a 5 star rating, but the razer burn is leaving me a little raw...."
2,Underpowered Norelco,"Bought the 8270XLCC ""Jet Clean"" for Hubbie. He has owned 4 Norleco rotory shavers over the years. He took this one back. It is WAY underpowered. At first he thought it had not fully charged - but it had. Says it is fine for a teenage boy in his first year of shaving, or for someone that loves to spend 30 mins looking at his face in the morning while going over and over the same area to catch the whiskers. Having to unplug the charging / cleaning station is another design flaw."
3,Buy the 8140XL instead,"The Norelco 8140XL is the best that you are going to get from an electric shaver. I tried a Remington foil shaver and it was horrible. It did a poor job of shaving, was VERY loud and made a mess of my bathroom when I cleaned it.I returned it and bought the 8160XL because it was the same price as the 8140XL on Amazon. The Jet Clean system is a waste of time and space. You clean the cutting blades by opening the top and holding it under running water - done! I don't see any reason to use the cleaning system.If you can't use a multi-blade razor and need to go electric then I recommend the Norelco 8140XL.My rating system:*****(5 stars) - Good old multi-blade razor and shave cream (my old skin can't take blades anymore)****(4 stars) - Norelco 8140XL***(3 stars) - Norelco 8160XL* (1 star) - Remington foil type shaver"
1,What's up?,Puchased this about six months ago and have tried to get it accustomed to my beard. It continues to shave slowly and not close. It even bogs down in the mustache. Went back to my Quadra and once again get a really good shave. A waste of a $100. Norelco was unresponsive to my inquiries about why it bogs down just doing a normal shave.
1,Just bought a refurbished model,"I bought this model refurbished for about $70 and I'm highly disappointed. The good point is that the razor is definitely very quiet, but it does not cut close at all. Also, I don't know why the new one comes with all that cleaning equipment, when the refurbished model I got says to just rinse it with water and came with no cleaning unit.I've only used this for a few days, and I'm not willing to ""allow 30 days for my skin to adjust"" because my return policy will expire. So I'm returning it. I've been using a previous Panasonic model for over a year that gives me a closer, better shave than this razor."
2,Norelco razor,"This razor was disappointing for me. It does not give a close shave and has trouble with the old and stiff hairs, particularly on the mustache area.It does have a long lasting battery, though."
2,Weak!,"My Braun shaver kicked out and I thought of trying the Norelco because I liked the features and was hoping to get a closer shave. The first thing that was a huge disappointment is learning how weak the motor is on the Norelco. When turning on my old Braun, my entire hand was vibrating the motor was so powerful. Of course, the important question is how close a shave it gives, and the answer - not very. I'm not sure if it's because of the weak motor or bad design, after 10 minutes of skin-stretching and going over the same parts of my beard, I still had plenty of whisers showing. Very disappointed, especially for the money. I expected a lot more from a brand like Norelco. It is going back."
1,SIXTY SMACKERS...!?,Does this book come with a dinner or what? I think i'll check out the public library or just sit back and wait for the movie...
3,It was cool,"I bought this and A Hustler's Wife together. Compared to the original which was riddled with typos, I was more or less pleased. I don't think it was any better or worse than the first and the storyline was good. Reminded me of a movie,"
2,I've been let down ...once again,"I wanted to throw all the blame on 50 cent because I blew good money and time on his book Death Before Dishonor and I thought how dare he put Nikki Turner name on a book just to get her faithful readers to buy that book. Then the day finally comes, the release of Forever a Hustlers Wife. I HATED THIS BOOK. Maybe Nikki should have did her fans a favor and saved Forever a Hustlers Wife when her heart and soul was ready to embrace the lives of Des and Yarni. She mentioned she had another book she wanted to write instead The Black Widow, I wish she would have left Forever a Hustlers Wife alone until she was ready to tell a good story. It took me over a month to finish this book it just wasnt a good story. Three strikes and your out!!! I hope The Black Widow change me back into the true fan I've tried to be."
3,Hustled,"I liked this book it was not one of my favorites, but this was a good sequel . Its been awhile since I've read the first one . This sequel stood alone, I thought I was going to have to go back and re- read the first book. But I think anyone who has not read the first one would enjoy the story just as well.just Ok for Nikki Turner"
3,IN THE MIDDLE,"Overall the book was good, I expected for it to be better than that. Yarni and Des are faced with new problems. Also new characters join the book. Bambi, Lynx, Cleezy, and Merci made a brief appearance in the book. The ending had me at a lost. I understand but not quite clear. I really enjoyed the book but thought it could have been better, especially after waiting so long."
3,Respectable Sequel to a Classic,"I certainly wasn't mad at Nikki Turner's ""Forever a Hustler's Wife"". I, for one, am happy that she wrote it. However, I didn't recall many of the characters: Bambi, Lynx, Nasir, etc. I should've re-read ""A Hustler's Wife"" before reading the sequel.I actually enjoyed this book. Des and Yarni are still hanging in there. I found Des' stunt as a Pastor hilarious. I think he portrayed a slimy pastor rather accurately. LOLOverall, I'd rate it 3 1/2 out of 5 stars."
5,Opps Nikki did it again!,"Nikki should give Essence magazine a high five or I would have never bought ""Hustler's Wife"" and the sequel, ""Forever a Hustler's wife"". I was really into the characters of Des and Yarni. I felt I knew them personally. Nikki Turner did a superior job in giving those with limited street knowledge an opportunity to connect with the real world. Nikki must do another sequel!"
1,Disappointed Aint EVEN the word,This book was NOT as good as I thought it was going to be nor was it as good as some reviewers said it was. I was VERY diappointed in this book! I was let down this time. This was NOT money well spent and I have all of Ms. Turner's books but this one is by far the worse of her literary career.
3,"Foreva, eva",The sequel didnt do any justice for the first novel. You have Des who is back in jail and being framed for murder. He has his nephew is coming up in the drug game and his uncle introduce him to a connect that will change his life forever.Then you have Yarni who is so thr lawyer helping this guy get off she is a new mother and and letting Des mother walk all over her. I can't even go on. Because this was not the Yarni in the First book who didn't let people walk all over her.
2,horrible,huster wife was on point this last book was horrible so unrealistic and dramatic.nikki turner couldve done a better job cause this one sucked.i love nikki but this last book wasnt it.
3,Forever A Hustler's Wife,"Nikki Nikki Nikki, in the beginning of this book you sent out a special message, to your readers, regarding how hard it was for you to write this book. Well I want to say, I really enjoy reading your books, but this one was a very big disappointment..... I tried to keep up with your characters in this book, but to my surprise I didnt know where these folks came from... I do have the majority of your books, but I refused to go back and read every one of them to figure out where certain folks came from...Im glad I got Forever a Hustler's Wife from the Library and I didnt purchase it myself.... Maybe the next book will be better.."
5,Forever a Nikki Turner's Fan,"First of all, I don't know why you hater out there giving Nikki negative comment. Because I read all her books and I am was even happier to read Forever a Hustler's Wife. I feel like it was worth my $15.00. I love the way she brought all her character together in one book. I was excite to see the changes that Yarni and Des made over the year. And how Yarni and Bambi has grown very close to each other. I am looking forward to her next project. Nikki, keep up the good work and never let these haters kill your joy."
5,Another Outstanding Book,I drove to three stores to purchase this book. Nikki Turner does it again. This was an outstanding book. The ending caught me by surprise. I can't wait until the next book comes out. I hope we don't have to wait long.
2,What happened? The book was rushed..,"I am a big fan of Nikki Turner, especially her novels ""A Hustler's wife"" & ""Riding Dirty on I-95"". BUT FOREVER A HUSTLER'S WIFE was indeed rushed and a fairytale comparing it to her other novels and to the first book. I most definitely was dissappointed with the novel. If I would have not read her other novels and ""Forever A Hustler's Wife"" would have been my first read by Nikki Turner then I wouldnt have misunderstood the hype about her urban literary skills."
2,Dissappointed,"I was so excited about reading this book. So far I have loved every book that Nikki Turner has ever written, except this once. I just didn't find myself on the edge of my seat like the others. This book was east to put down. The plot and sub-plots were predictable and the end left some unanswered questions. This one just didn't do it for me."
2,know when to fold,forever a hustler's wife should have never been put on paper. I did not enjoyed this book at all Ms Turner destoryed a true classic.
2,Tisk! Tisk! Tisk!,This book is some bull.... Nikki should have left it alone. The things that happen in this book was a joke.The way Des treated Yarni.... NEVER would have happen..How she gone have Joyce and Yarni beefing... They was VERY tight at the close of the last book.Where did Des get a brother and a nephew from????Bambi mother was a chef????? NO she was a DRUNK!!!!!!!!!Why in this book Yarni talk to her mom 3 times????? They was VERY TIGHT!!!!How she gone say that Lava felt like family and looking at her she could see it but NEVER said who her people were????How did she had Lynx coming home from Jail but he was home at the end of The glamorous life????How did she having Yarni popping pills and she was so against drugs.....I'm going to stop cause I can go on... Nikki should have left this a classic!At the end of the day I'm going to say Tisk! Tisk! Tisk!
3,hustela wife,i have read the book twice to make sure i understood the book and got the same ending i think the book could have end a little better because when unique told bambi that o boy was after her i think she she have went into details.
2,So so...wish I would have borrowed from the library,Nikki Turner should have just left it at the first book. The book was boring compared to the first one and the ending was horrible. I literally wanted to throw the book against the wall when I was done. I was very disappointed.
3,ok read,"It took a me a couple of times to really get into the book, but once I got started it was an ok read."
5,The Closer - Complete Fifth Season,"My order arrived in good condition as noted by the vendor and in a timely manner. I wouldpurchase from this vendor again. ""The Closer"" is a delightful series and I would highly recommend it for good family entertainment."
5,Versatile crime drama series,"This is my favorite TV series of all time - the dialogue is witty and the character development through the seasons has been fun to watch. They've managed to keep continuity from episode to episode, and the stories are still engaging, even after almost six seasons."
4,"""like new""","My DVD set was actually VERY NEW, when they say ""like New"" they mean it!! very pleased with my purchase!"
5,Outstanding!,"Not being one who 'keeps up with' current TV shows,""The Closer"" went right under my radar. Once I saw a few episodes, I knew I wanted to own it. Characters are well developed, there's a good chuckle in everyshow and the stories are interesting without alot ofunnecessary gore. I am sick that they are about towrap up their final season."
3,toujours la mme,"encore une saison ou le chef johnson vas encore pratiquer son savoir faire et ses interogatoires etranges, dommage cette saison est un peu fade, par manque d humour ou de situation speciale, je ne sait pas je suis rester un peu sur ma faim ce que je regrette , j espere que cette baisse seras temporaire"
1,Damaged,The first disc was totally unusable. Picture kept freezing. This also happen when I first started watching the 2nd disc. Becasue I waited to watch it I no longer have the box or paperwork. I have since ordered a copy from someone else
5,"At last, a proven, repeatable PROCESS!","I recently embarked on a project to improve my negotiating skills. I read about half a dozen books and for the most part they left me wanting more. The main thing that was missing was a PROCESS.""Getting Past NO"" provides a simple, proven and repeatable process that you can take with you and hone in the real world.Mr. Ury calls this process--Breakthrough Negotiation. The steps are:1) Go to the balcony2) Step to their side3) Reframe4) Build them a golden bridge5) Use power to educateThe book is very well written with excellent examples and wonderful stories and metaphors. The book is well organized and provides an excellent summary that helps ensure that you ""get it""."
4,Teaches Useful Skills,- Very easy to understand - Great advise - Very helpful - Useful in both professional and personal life
4,Meets Expectations,"If you were expecting the same breakthrough content that informed ""Getting to Yes,"" you won't be happy with this book, it's true.However, there are clear roadmaps here for handing difficult or obstructionistic people. The book outlines simple, practical steps for breaking down resistence, such as:1) Go to the balcony2) Step to their side3) Reframe4) Build them a golden bridge5) Use power to educateIn my experience, the most valuable of these are going to the balcony and reframing. Sometimes, if a person hits you as difficult or unfair, it is hard to see the issues from their perspective unless you take the boradest possible view. And we can never think as clearly as when our emotions are engaged.It's a good book - not as great as ""Getting to Yes,"" but very, very good."
4,Getting Past No,"The cover and publication date are not as posted on amazon, otherwise in good condition and quick ship from date of purchase. I specifically was looking for a more recent publication of this classic book."
5,Excellent High School/College reference,This is an indispensable high school or early college reference for basic scientific term descriptions. There's a lot of vocabulary in all science fields and this fairly easy to read dictionary is wonderful. Penguin has done an excellent job with both this and the Mathematics Penguin dictionaries. Considering the very inexpensive used copies often floating around this should be added to most student's libraries as an indispensable reference. A great gift for high school students - unless they pursue high level college science they'll never outgrow it.
4,Great cover and looks good.,"This is a very good cover and looks real nice.Solid cover design and material. It was very easy to install, it only took little over 1 hour.I laid all the parts out to make sure everything was included and would fit.There was no problems to follow the instructions, only requiring a wrench and a large standard screw driver.Almost anyone should be able to install this cover."
5,Great Price,"I'm not sure how this is possible but the price here is actually about 100 less than from the manufacturers site. This is the second time I've put a Truxedo cover on a pick up that I've bought. I love these covers. This one is actually better than the first one cause you can close the tailgate before you lock in the cover. On my last one I had to lock down the cover before closing the tailgate. It's a great cover. The only thing is you have to fine tune the tension adjusters a few times as the cover gets stretched out from the weather. Takes a few days of tightening it before it stays nice & tight. Other than that, it handles big snow falls, rain, wind, anything and the inside of the bed stays dry. THUMBS UP!"
3,Not the original hits,"The are remakes by some members of the original group. The quality is not bad, but these are not the original hits."
1,Placebo,"I was expecting the original hits by this group on this CD, someone is ripping the public off with a remake of the Crystals hit songs. I never heard Darlene Love in any of the songs, and whoever sang lead on ""One fine day"" sounds like a Michael Jackson impersonator. I want my money back after waiting 6 weeks to this trash."
1,"Very, very disappointed","I'm sorry I did not pay attention to the reviews before I ordered this item. I agree that it is a remake, but it does not say so anywhere on the CD jacket. It is very deceiving and, if I had known, I would not have purchased it. I will be returning it to Amazon ASAP."
1,Piece of garbage,"I have nothing against re-making classic music cheaply and on the fly for release as a cheap piece of garbage for people who apparently don't care about the music. The thing is, those CDs say what they are. This ""Crystals"" CD is one of those, it just happens to conveniently forget that. These are sub-par covers of the songs, regardless of whether there's an original Crystal in the mix or not. Any instrumentation used is universally weak on every song on this CD. The programmed drums are the worst and just get more horrible as the CD progresses. This is not a ""best of"" collection but a collection of covers one would expect to find in a large cardboard box at Wal-Mart for $2.99. I might not be as peeved if it was stated what this CD is, anywhere on it. It makes it out to be the original recordings which is an absolute, bald faced lie. I literally hate this CD and anyone who worked on it in any form. Waste your money on something else, this CD isn't worth it."
2,STOP... BE WARNED!!!,IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR ORIGINAL CRYSTALS RECORDINGS DO NOT BUY THIS CD. THESE ARE NOT THEM. SOME OF THE SELECTIONS ON THIS RECORDING HAVE DISCO RHYTHM TRACTS... AND NOT GOOD ONES. UNFORTUNATELY I ALSO DID NOT READ THE REVIEWS. IF IT HADN'T BEEN SO INEXPENSIVE I WOULD MAKE SOMEONE RETURN MY MONEY.
1,No Truth in Advertising,"Totally disappointed in this CD and getting disappointed with Amazon. This is the second time I had to return a CD, due to the fact that it is not the original songs or the original artists. ""He's a Rebel"" starts out like a disco song. This is going back and no more CD's for me from Amazon, especially the oldies."
2,Best of the Crystals,A serious disappointment. All the songs are re-recordings made when the members of the group were older. They lack the snap and the joy of the original recordings. I cannot recommend this disk.
1,Awful Awful Awful,"These don't even qualify as good remakes. And as many other reviewers have pointed out, there is nothing to indicate that these are remakes. False advertising. Don't buy it."
2,Hold off on this,"Get the ""Wall of Sound"" CD and you will get the main hits of the Crystals, plus the Ronettes and other Phil Specter sounds."
4,Very good!,"This is a very good album by the great Katrina and the Waves. All songs are good and their playing/interpretation outstanding, as usual. I highly recommend it to all fans of 80's music."
3,Need info,"Has anyone seen this? Is it from the late 60's/early 70's,or is it from the 90's.A song list would be helpful also. Thanks."
5,The Corrs,"I liked this book a lot. It was very informative and it got me to liking The Corrs even more, if that's even possible. Any Corrs fan should have this book."
1,Helpless Book !!,"If you're thinking about getting an Akita as a pet and need to really learn about the dog-DON'T GET THIS BOOK !!Plenty of info about the origin of the dog,but I need to know if he's the right dog for me. I need more info on tmperment and specific health concerns. This book is mostly a general dog book with some Akita info-now I have to get another book !!!"
3,The World of the Akita,"The original book written by Barbara Andrews is expensive in the hardcover edition. But, I am so thankful that I sacrificed and purchased it when I saw a copy in Petsmart. It has gone out of print, just when the Akita is hitting stride as a household pet that can be maintained by the average pet lover. Ms. Andrews put her heart and soul in the first book and it shows. The second book is not as far reaching in the kinds of information revealed in the original. I have had three Akitas and the original ""The World of the Akita"" has been the saving grace. I will probably always own an Akita, for as long as I can take care of a big pet. And, this book will be a cherished part of my library. I loaned it out once, never again! If you are an Akita owner or plan to be, I seriously suggest acquiring a copy of the original book. If you can't, get the new version, it's better than nothing."
5,Warn service is amazing,"Warn customer service is pretty amazing. I had a problem with my ATV winch and not only was I able to quickly connect with an english speaking human, but he gave me a direct email address to send photos to, personally walked them to an engineer and in no time resolved my problem. You don't see this kind of service any more. I hope my winch never dies but if I need a new one it will be a Warn."
5,Best Bang for the buck,"Sure, you can find lower priced winches but they are probably made in China. This Warn M8000 is made in the US. It is one of the best winches you can buy for the money. This is my second M8000. The first one was bought in 1997 and I sold it on my Jeep. This model M8000 features the upgraded control box. Very nice."
5,winch,"What can I say,it's a warren winch, that says it all,great product,made in USA,looks good on my Hummer too!You cant go wrong w/a warren winch!"
4,Weather,"This is a short book, similar in format to the other Golden Guides. It's gone through several revisions, but the content remains consistent.People interested in basic meteorology may consider this book a good starting point. It provides the basics on air currents, precipitation, clouds, fronts, etc. It may not be text book calibre, but it remains true to its roots. Teens may find the information useful, particularly if they have questions that parents cannot answer. There's not a lot of technical language that will only add to the confusion and the chapters are short enough to keep the reader on track."
5,Great handy weather guide.,"I bought this book 5 years ago from a hurricane gift shop in Galveston, TX. After setting up a weather station in my backyard. I turn to this book. I love the details on everything. When i need to know anything about the current weather this is the book i go for."
3,"Half the designs, more than half the price","This card contains half of the designs that are on the Brother Disney ""Film Stars"" embroidery card. That card can be commonly found for $99 or less. To get all of the same designs, you have to buy two of these cards (the New Disney Classics and Belle and Ariel card). If you are only going to use Ariel & Belle, this is good. If you want Lion King and Aladdin too, you should look into the full size Film Stars card instead."
4,It's quite good after all !!,"Ok fine....he IS kind of ugly,. but he's PERFECT for my actout!!!!His knees bend, his arms bend, oh and his hair....they seemed to put some men's hair gel so it's won't fly during the play.It's quite educational, because he tells kids not to be TOO disappointed...Yes.He dosen't come with skates, but on the bright side, he comes with shiver!!!And, why not make some skates???I don't have Brietta the pegasus, and yet, I made paper wings and used that for my normal horse instead...I don't have crowns, so took it off from my old princess Barbie.It's already a good smile for a MEN!!!!wHAT DO YOU EXPECT??(Oops....Capitalized....)Well overall....it;s a Barbie, it's prince Aidan,And he is kindof the main character, so why not try??His clothes are good afterall....Hope this Helps!!Barbie Fan"
2,Nothing like the movie,"The doll looks nothing like the Aidan in the movie. Actually, his face is kind of funny looking. The movie Aidan is cuter. The doll could definitely have been made better!"
1,Ahhhh! (Runs away screaming...),"Aaaghhhh! My eyes! That has got to be the scariest looking guy mattel has ever come up with! His outfit is great, but honestly, I shuddered when I first saw his face."
4,All You Have To Do Is Get Over The Smile!,"If you do that, then you've got Annika's best friend/dreamboy! He wears a very nice outfit. By the way, his name is Aidan. He has pants, boots, and a nice shirt. In the movie, he helps Annika make the wand, while Annika inspires him to always believe in yourself! He looks very cute in the movie. And he will look presentable if you fix his hair and get over the smile!"
2,he's kinda ugly......,Is Barbie really goingto marry HIM?????? EWWW hes ugly......i mean lookat his face!!!!!!ewwwwwwww......he's got girl lips! buy the pegasus barbie tho cuz she is BEAUTIFUL!!!!!
5,Creepy....,"Walls of sounds and sound bites, this cd will defineatly get under your skin. Better than any horror movie, this one plays out in your head.Grab your headphones, turn out the lights, close your eyes and enjoy the thrills!"
5,perfect,exactly what I asked for. Cannot wait to make some home made spices/herb mixes. thank you very much & happy holidays!
3,Terk Speaker connector & bannana plugs.,The speaker connector plate was o.k. but it didn't work well with the dual bannana plugs I bought for the purpose. Apparently the jacks are too close together. I had to saw apart the dual bannana plugs for them to work without breaking the wall plate.
2,not good,The pins in which we have to put the speaker wires are very near to each other. It is a pain to loosen or tighten them. I have seen better ones in Radio Shack and circuit city (for a few dollars more) which have better spaced connectors.
4,We need more balance,"John Naisbitt is very high touch in person. When he told me his next book would be about high tech, high touch--the most popular and shortest chapter in Megatrends--I was hoping for examples of how to achieve that balance. Alas I was mistaken. I came away from the read very sensitized to the encroachment of the technologically intoxicated zone. I chuckled at realizing our two biggest markets are consumer technology and escape from consumer technology. These are valuable lessons and well documented. There are a few personable moments in the book that point towards turning off the TV. But the reader needs to look elsewhere and inward for the antidote."
2,Disappointed,"After reading Saving Grace and Fall from Grace, I was expecting big things from After the Fall. However, I was disappointed in the long drawn out story with a cheesy ending."
4,Happy to have purchased this blade,Have not used this blade as often as I will in the future. It cuts very good and cleanly. I would buy another one in the future.
5,Fantastic,"I absolutely love these shoes!! In fact, I like them so much, that I have ordered 8 pairs in different styles. They fit great. I can't say enough about these shoes."
4,Well Met,"Sarah Hoyt has written a lovely fantasy that has the young Will Shakespeare saving his wife from the world of fairy, meeting his muse, and witnessing an internecine fairy conflict that will become grist for much of his future writing. She has also given us a literary guessing game as characters, quotes, and plots of the Bard's output come peeking around the corners of the story. Ariel is a dream. Her look into ""fairyland"" is often stunning in its invention. I particularly liked the use of dew drops as a sort of Elizabethan era DVD. There are points where the plot drags, but the book is short enough that we quickly move back along, and the excitement of fairy duels and life at court more than make up for any shortcomings. This book will do well in the hands of an adult, but should do exceptionally well with the ""young mature"" reader. Recommended."
3,Tangled in magic,"Young Will Shakespeare finds his wife and daughter missing, and soon learns they've been taken by the elf king Sylvanus. The elf prince Quicksilver (who can switch between male and female forms) wants to use Will as a pawn to reclaim his throne and avenge the murder of his parents. When he begins to fall in love with the mortal, he finds himself at a crossroads that might change the lives of everyone, both mortal and magical. Imagining Shakespeare's inspirations for his famous plays, Sarah Hoyt delights readers with this tale of intrigue, fairies, vengeance, and love. While the overly ornate language is sometimes distracting, I do think the book as a whole is quite enjoyable."
5,Pure magic!,"Sarah A. Hoyt blends magic and Shakespeare into a heady brew! Will Shakespeare is a 19-year-old school teacher, barely able to make ends meet for his wife and baby daughter. Then his wife and child disappear, taken by the ""good people"", the fairies, and Will must join forces with Quicksilver, an enigmatic elf, to save them.I definitely recommend this book for any fantasy or Shakespeare lover--and especially for anyone who loves both! Ms. Hoyt shows a side of Shakespeare I'd never considered. Conventional wisdom has it that Shakespeare and Ann Hathaway had an unhappy marriage, based on the evidence of the second-best bed, etc. Here we see Shakespeare in love (no pun intended) with his older, strong-minded wife.Part of the fun of this book was identifying the many references to Shakespeare's plays. I noted ""Hamlet"", ""As You Like It"", ""Romeo and Juliet"", and many others, and I probably missed quite a few.The moral of this review: catch this book before, like fairy magic, it disappears."
5,Ill Met By Moonlight Takes the Reader to Another Realm,"Sarah Hoyt's debut novel, ""Ill Met By Moonlight"" is a wonderfully crafted tale that dances between the worlds of the historical William Shakespeare and that of the fairies immortalized in his plays. Ms. Hoyt has an amazing talent for transporting her readers into the minds and environments of her characters in a way that makes her stories tangible to the senses. I found ""Ill Met By Moonlight"" to be an engrossing tale, one that I spoke so enthusiastically about to other family members that they were chomping at the bit waiting for me to finish so that they could have their turns reading it!"
3,Good dvd,"It is a good dvd, however, the woman's dress is so long it is difficult to see any of her leg and hip movements."
2,Beware the tome,"This book is humongous and very heavy (even in its paperback format). The photos are in black and white, which was disappointing, and there's no mention of the sites in the biggest cities because that stuff is apparently common knowledge (not). Overall, it's a pretty good book to help you research a trip in advance, but you will definitely need to leave it at home."
3,possibilities,"I've been shaving for years with electric shavers. Back when Remingtons were still made in USA and Norelco's in Japan. This shaver is good. It is very quiet. The shave isn't as close as the older model 850RX. My cheap Wahl shaves closer and faster but is far too noisy.The batteries would give many shaves if I didn't have to spend so much time getting a close shave. Because of the time it takes and the marginal quality of the closness I could not give it more than 3 stars.One for being quiet, one for being non-irritating, and one for overall construction quality.But it lost one for being a slow shaver, and lost one for not shaving closer."
3,"After less than 2 years, it will not turn off.",I would rate it at 5 starts except that the power switch is no longer working. I expect a razor to be trouble free for 4-6 years.Could it be related to the water cleaning? If I was careless it would have shown up in the first few days or weeks. It seems to me that a minute amount of moisture can seep down the back--into the trimmer area and then what may happen over time?? Or did the switch go bad? Or did some water get into the switch? How water proof is it over the long term?
4,Leaves Skin Softer,"On the whole, my experience with this razor has been positive. Although I switched from manual razors mainly because I was tired of nicking myself and expected a trade-off in closeness, my girlfriend says that my skin is actually softer now that I used the 8140XL. Definitely give it a week or two after switching from a manual razor to let your skin adjust; my shaves got remarkably better after the first few days of use.- Pros: Leaves skin softer; shaves upper lip better than any manual razor; hair length after shave is consistent (including on neck); easy and quick to clean.- Cons: Inevitably misses hairs (although it's hard to tell without close inspection); not quite as close as a manual razor, so you will have to shave every morning if you want a clean-cut look; sideburn cutter not especially useful.I recommend buying Lectric Shave or a similar product to prep your stubble for shaving with the 8140XL, it makes a small but significant difference in the closeness of the shave."
3,could be good if you are used to it,"I bought this shaver for my husband, who was willing to try and replace the wet with a dry shave. The head is flexible, but takes a while getting used to and he cut himself way too many times in that first try. In the end he said he will stick with the traditional razor and we returned it. It is probably a great shaver, just didn't work in our case."
5,very good product,My husband really likes this Norelco. He had a very old one and he says this one is fantastic.
3,"Norelco Razor, Model # 8140XL","This is probably at least my 7th Norelco Razor. I purchased it becuase of the advertised larger cutting surface. I find that it does not cut quite as good as some of the older models with, I beleive 6 & 7 style cutting blades. Its OK, but I expected better."
4,"Great Shave, Fair Price","After much too much research, I ended up buying a Philips Norelco 8140XL electric shaver. I had been using a Remington of a similar design, but the battery failed after about 18 months. This shaver has all the features that I wanted and none of the features I didn't want. I wanted the speed shaver set-up, the charging stand, and an LED that indicates when the shaver needs to be charged. I didnt want the cleaning stand, the LED that tells you way too much info (8150XL), lotion dispensing, etc. I wanted a close, comfortable shave - at a fair price. That is what I got. Great shave, easy to use, and good price. I would definitely purchase again."
4,Philips Norelco 8140XL,This is a fine electric shaver. I don't shave daily so I needed a fighter and this one does it. My only disappointment is the long wait to get the car charger that I wanted for it initially.
2,not good!!,"The head is not strong. When I swep the water out of the machine.The head is disconnect from the machine.And it is not working good now.I just buy it one month,"
3,Expectations,"I bought this shaver thinking it was better than my old Quad Norelco. It is not because it doesn't have some of the features I expected. I am disappointed that what was a simple Norelco shaver now has so many features that it is impossible to tell the better ones from the standard ones, except for prices differences. When I look on the web (Amazon and Norelco) it would be great if there was a side-by-side chart comparing all the fetures of all the Norelco shavers. That would do a lot to help customers sort out which features and prices range work the best for them. It is easier to buy a car because at least the manufacturer has grouped the options so that customers don't have to look at 20 simular but different cars (other than colors)."
1,bad shaver,Philips Norelco 8140XL SpeedXL Men's Shaverdid not do a very good job ruff shave ouch! sent it back
2,Build quality vs. Shave quality,"This razor is built to extremely high standards with quality materials. The razor is both waterproof and very quiet. However, the shave quality is horrible. I got a much better and quicker shave from my $35 remington that unfortunately gave up after about a year."
3,Something missing,"This is a very good razor. Easy maintenance and it does the job. Unfortunately, it lacks an important feature. There's no recharge indicator. You only know it has to be recharged when it stops working. No warning of any kind. I admit I made an assumption based on my last Norelco model. A lesser problem is with the power switch. The location and incredible sensitivity make it too easy to accidentally turn the thing off while shaving."
5,clean shave and easy to clean,I've had the shaver for 8 months of daily use. Gives a clean shave and cleaning it under hot running water is easy and quick. Much better than the braum it replaced.
3,JUST AN AVERAGE SHAVER,"[ASIN:B0009MFUOA Philips Norelco 8140XL SpeedXL Men's Shaver]]I have been using a Norelco 6826XL. I recently bought a Norelco 8140 SpeedXL.The cutting heads of the 8140 SpeedXL seem to rotate slower (less RPM) than the 6826XL. It seems to take me more time to shave. I have to keep going over the same areas to shave. Cutting quality in my opinion is only fair--I can not seem to get a close enough shave.Also, I like the heavier weight of the 6826XL rather that the light weight of the 8140 SpeedXL. I am going to try other razors to find a faster and better shave."
2,the switch,"I wanted to try a different cordless besides Remington.Been buying Rems`for 15 yr. or so.The Norelco 8140XL is slow and weak on my beard.If you shave again in under 24 hrs. It does a fair job.Anything over that it barely works.If you have heavy stubble,dont get it.Wayne HoweRochester,NY"
1,"If you can stand the pain, this shaver is for you","Used Norelcos for about 10 years now; most recent is the Norelco Spectra. Decided to try this new shaver and I have to say that this is my first Noreclo that does more then lift and cut hairs. It actually pulls the hairs right off your face. I guess you can't get a closer shave than that and it will definitely wake you up in the morning. I tried to get used to it, but ended up returning it."
4,worth the discounted price not much more,Seems like it will be a reliable shaver but sort of weak on speed and battery. The extra light material makes you believe it is a cheaper product however nothing else makes me believe it wont last a while. I dont believe I am not getting my moneys worth but I would have spent some extra and upgraded for something a little stronger. I like to beleive my investment is what I will be using for several years.
3,Mediocre product,"I purchased this razor for my husband as a gift. For the amount of $$ I spent, I expected it to work much better than it did. Doesn't shave very closely and just doesn't have much ""power"" behind it. Looks like a sturdy product, just dissatisfied w/ the effectiveness of it."
4,Philips Norelco 8140 XL,"Not a bad razor. While the razor does not shave as close as I would like, it does shave very quickly. Very smooth with no irritation to my skin. The screen glides over the face with no effort. Over all not a bad product"
3,My beard is not suitable for the new norelcos,"when you buy a new norelco, you expect to get some improvement.Well, I have been using norelcos my full life! I am not truly dissapointed by this one, but it nothing close to a ""manual razor"".My beard grows in all directions, so it is quite dificult to get all the hairs in a couple of passes...I have to go over the same place quite a few times, and I don't feel like it is as soft as ""just shaved""...Not as bad as needing a new shave in early afternoon... but the hairs are there...I have used it for more than a month, everyday... and it might have imporved a little bit from the first days, but it still is not the perfect shaver."
4,Very good shaver,"I've owned several Norelco shavers over the last 20 years or so, and this offers the best shave of all of them. I also appreciate the fact that this unit holds a charge for more shaves than any of the previous units. However, this unit does not provide any indicator of the remaining charge in the batteries, otherwise I would give it a 5 star rating. This can present a surprise when the unit just stops when it runs out of juice, or one must be more proactive in recharging. Yes, it will quick charge, but my personal preference would be to have some sort of charge level indicator, which is offered on other, more expensive units."
4,worth the price,i bought this gift for my husband and he enjoys it. he has sensitive skin and has been through many electric shavers. after a few days it was easy for his skin to adjust to it. he says it's a good bang for the buck!
2,Dissapointed,"I bought this to replace a Norelco 6848XL (about 10 years old?) that has worked well, but is beginning to have poor battery life. This new 8140XL appears to me to be cheaply built, to the point that I find myself still leaning towards using the older model. In more detail, the cutting heads are slightly larger on the 8140, but much less smooth (even painful to an extent) than the older model. Also, the cutting head is held on to the 8140 by a very sloppy connection and falls off very easily when you are trying to clean it. The whole general construction of the 8140 seems to much less ""solid"" than the older 6848.In short, Norelco seems to have gone towards cheaper cosnstruction in an attempt to save on costs (and yes, to be able to offer the 8140 at a ""low"" cost to the consumer). However, this consumer is not impressed. In hindsight, I should have instead sent the 6848 in for new batteries."
2,"Disappointing shave, not as good as Braun.","I wasn't keen on this razor. I had a Braun for two years and the battery died on me. So it would not recharge. I thought I would give Norelco a go. I don't like the plastic feel of the unit and after a few weeks it is not shaving my neck well at all. I know it takes time for your skin to adjust, but for me this does not give a close enough shave.I was so frustated that I have turned back to using a regular razor. I will be returning this product to Noreclo. Fortuanately it comes with a full 60 day money back guarnatee. Although you have to pay for the shipping back to them."
2,Norelco 8140XL,This is the 4th Norelco triple header I have owned. All of the others were superior to this one. It has a light cheap feel to it. The on/off switch is placed where it easily turns off when you grip the handle while shaving. The heads slip under the cover and stick there if you press the shaver firmly against your face. The battery charge is only 55 minutes..my old one was about 76 minutes. Not very pleased with this razor.
3,Not Too Sharp.,The razor was bought for my son for Christmas. He said that in order to get a close shave he had to push it up against his skin so hard that he got razor burn from it. We returned the razor.
4,After about a week...,"It seems as if it's way weaker than my older 8825xl and it seems that it takes more time to clean the neck than if I would have used the 8825. It does get rid of facial hair better though and that's what counts the most. I like the overall design and the blue led is a nice touch. Haven't noticed the advertised effect of the 50% shaving surface, oh well."
4,very good electric razor,"This gives me a much closer shave than my previous electric razor, and is comfortable to use."
1,Disappointed due to no delivery of Chrismas Gift,The item was a Christmas gift which was never delivered; plus no reason was given why it didn't ship
1,awful,i researched this shaver very diligently and foundgreat reviews. the one i received is very light weightapparently because of an undersized battery. does nothave enough power to give a decent shave. i quit even tryingto use it and bought a remington that is just satisfactorybut a lot cheaper.
1,Not Good,This razor is not good to my knowledge.It is not giving close shave. Particularly in the neck. I started to continue with my Mach3.
2,Norelco razor,I was very disappointed with this electric razor. I have had many Norelco razors but this one actually pulls hairs instead of cutting them. I contacted Norelco and Amazon with my dissatisfaction. I would not purchase another one.
4,"Not really an ""upgrade"", but still a good razor","I have owned two Norelco Quadra-Action razors, and I was very pleased those. When I accidentally dropped my last one I decided to go ahead and step up to SpeedXL line, thinking I would notice significant improvements. The razor still does a great job for an electric, but I have to say the changes Norelco has made over the Quadra line are not noticeable to me: It takes the same amount of time for me to shave, the same few places are hard to get smooth, and the battery life is about the same.So, if you are considering this and a Quadra-Action, I would suggest you save yourself some money and go with the latter, seemingly-identical razor."
2,Norelco Speed-XL8140 not so good,"I had used the same Norelco razor for the past ten years. It has ceased to hold a charge some time back so I had to use it with the cord. Nonetheless, it continued to provide me with a close shave in a short amount of time. Even so, I decided to upgrade to a newer version not only so that I could again have a cordless razor but also to take advantage of any new technology.After extensive research, I settled on the Speed-XL8140 primarily based on price-point and the pivoting heads. Suffice to say, I am extremely disappointed with my purchase. The razor doesn't have near the power that my older model still provides which results in it taking me roughly five times as long to shave each and every morning. I have been using it for the past 6 weeks and it hasn't gotten any better. Even with the extended shaving time, my shave is no closer than it was with the older model. Definitely not woth the $90 I paid!"
1,More is not better!,"I owned one of the predecessors to Norelco's current Cool Skin line of shavers, however it was stolen from the bathroom in my college dorm, so I decided to give this razor a try. After using the razor for a month, I have yet to receive a close shave without irritation. The razor heads are so large, that they really don't contour to my face at all. Additionally, the excessive amount of openings on the razor head guard only lead to more irritation, not a quick, smooth shave as advertised. I also find it somewhat awkward to use the pop up trimmer. It comes up from the rear, which means you have to hold the razor backward to use it. If I want to invert the trimmer to buzz up underneath my sideburns, I have to hold the trimmer in place otherwise it will fold back down and close.Needless to say, I am sending this razor back to Norelco and purchasing the Cool Skin 7735X - an updated model of the razor that gave me a close, smooth, painless shave for almost 2 years."
4,Affordable Excellence,"been a Norelco guy since whisker #1 and this is a good choice for the person who does not need all the bells & whistles. Very easy to get a super-close shave and incredibly easy to clean. the only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 is the fact that it does not give any warning that it is about to crap out and require a recharge. Granted in a minute you can be shaving again, but it is a minor annoyance."
3,norelco shaver,"Shaver works fine...but, there is room for improvement with the stand setup. The shaver stand is also the plug-in charger; this is what comes with the shaver. This means there is no place to stand the razor so it can drain completely,afer you have water-washed the head. I.E., the water remaining in the body drains down thru the body to dry.I for one ,certainly won't stand it in the charger when it is doing this. Thus it ends up laying on the countertop, which is undesirable."
3,Norelco 8140XL,"Good shaver, I wouldn't pay over 100 $ for it. Amazon delivery wasn't that fast even if I paid 25$ + to have it fast. That's probably because it had to go through border. Satisfy of the product overall. Don't make negative comment from seller, they will call you home to have it removed."
1,You'll really need the 2 year warranty,"I have owned numerous Norelcos in the past, and kept them for 5-6 years each. So I gladly bought this one back in Aug 07. I was disappointed in Dec 07 when it had an electrical problem, turning itself on and off at will. But customer service was terrific, and they sent me a new one with no questions asked. Then that one went bac in Jul 09. Again, a replacement with no problem. Now in Dec 09 that one has gone bad as well -- out of warranty. I don't know if any shaver company is better, but I'm done with Norelco and will be trying Braun or Panasonic or Remington."
4,Norelco 8140XL,"Smooth shaver, holds charge for 5-6 shaves. No indicator to show how much battery power remains."
3,Norelco shaver 8140XL,"This shaver is light-weight and recharges quickly. It is so quiet that I sometimes think it is losing power prior to failing, but it does not. It just continues running. It is recommended that the recharging stand be disconnected from the AC in between recharges, so the most absurd thing about this new shaver is that the owner is constantly having to plug and unplug the AC plug to the recharging stand. I don't understand why Philips didn't provide a simple on/off switch on the recharging stand such as the one on the shaver itself. I also found that the cleaning brush is too short to clean the long thin connections inside the razor head. It is O.K. for the blades though, and I am able to blow the beard cuttings out with an air hose. I also use a wire bristle brush from a another brand of razor that I formerly owned."
1,Disappointing,"Its probably a case of these rotary head shavers either works well for you or it doesn't. In my case it doesn't. Very disppointed after spending that much money. As some reviewers have pointed out you have to pass the machine over the same spot several times and still it doesn't shave properly. I have to end up using a razor ""to clean up"" so what's the point. I may as well use a razor and shaving cream. I thought it would be quicker than using a razor but its NOT."
2,Not what I expected,"I've used Norelco razors for many years. I was very disappointed in the quality and feel of this razor when I received it. It feels cheap when you hold it and it doesn't have a good solid sound like the previous models I owned. There is no light or meter to indicate when a charge is needed. You can tell when its running down or it just stops when the battery is exhausted.The packaging it came in is deadly! It was encased in numerous layers of blister packs with no easy way to cut the packaging to get to the razor. If you're not careful, you can easily cut yourself on the plastic packaging.The shave is adequate, but as I mentioned above it lacks the sound and feel that I used to experience with previous models which diminishes the satisfaction of the shaving experience.I would not recommend this razor and I'm looking for a replacement even though I just purchased it a couple of months ago."
5,Ótimo produto,"Barbeador excelente, no irrita a pele, faz uma barba bem rente, a bateria dura bastante e também é bem silencioso.Inicialmente, nos primeiros dias de uso, a pele sente um pouco o barbeador, mas a própria norelco avisa que podem haver irritaes de pele que faz parte do processo de acomodao da pele.Já estou usando ele a 10 dias sem recarregar e nem sinal da bateria estar proxima do fim."
1,product self destoryed within 3 weeks,I purchased for my husband The shave head broke the rod holding heads within third week of ownership Now the heads are destoryed The body mechanical system is destoryed I believe that less than 3 weeks of use for the expense of @ $80.00 is too much There are no replacement parts available tjc
1,"Good shave, but does not last long",I went through two of these over the last 3 years. The first one failed after one year. I received a replacement from Norelco because it was still under warrenty. The second one lasted two years. I opened it up and it appeared the motor burned out. There was a burnt smell coming from the motor.I liked the shave but these things just do not last very long. I have a 15 yr old 885RX and it works great. Still gives a pretty good shsve. You can see the difference in quality. The 885RX had much better construction than the 8140. I just ordered a Panasonic ES7103K. The reviews indicate it is well constructed.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"I bought this to replace a Norelco Cool Skin shaver. I had the Cool Skin for 2 years and loved it, but the battery wore out.The Speed XL 7800XLCC is a waste of money. There is no ""Speed"" in this thing at all. The motor is weak, the charge does not last for more than one shave.It takes a half hour to shave, and the shave still sucks. The heads barely cut.I am going to send his back to Norelco.I don't know what I will try next. I liked the Cool Skin, but the lotion dispenser is fragile, and I'd rather have a pop up trimmer."
2,R,"I loved my previous Norelco. It lasted over a decade. I bought this as a replacement, and it went dead in a matter of months. It just wouldn't hold a charge any longer. I sent it back, and customer service was promt in replacing it. Then the same thing happened again a few months later. This is too much hassle for the amount of money this razor costs. I went and bought a $30 Braun that has been going strong for a couple years without any problem."
2,Wish I was happier with this shaver,"Seems to be a nice shaver, but if you skip a day of shaving you really notice the pull on the whiskers. I figured that would happen when it got dull after a few months but it was that way out of the box. Also, the light that's supposed to come on when you need to recharge doesn't. Not sure if I got a lemon, but I'm not super impressed. But I just make sure I shave every day and no whisker pulling. Also didn't get everything I was supposed to get in the package. Missing the cleaning brush, but I can use my old shaver brush. Not a huge deal by itself, but when added to the whisker pulling, and lack of recharge notice, not overly happy. Hope others have had good luck with this one."
3,Slow shave takes a long time,"The motor for this shaver goes so slow compared to what I am used to. It feels like the shaver is in slow motion. It takes a long time to shave compared with the remington I used to use. The blade heads stay sharp for about a month, after chich you have to go over and over the same spot."
3,Very slow shave,"I suspect that Costco sells a lower quality version of the XL razor. This one gives a very slow shave (the motor runs very slow). The sharpness of the blades lasts about 1 month. If you have a thick beard, this isn't for you."
5,FANTASTIC electric razor!,"What a surprise! My face is certainly better off with any blade, but I had grown VERY tired of spending the money on 17 blades of stainless steel. So for the last 4 years I've had a ""linear"" Panasonic electric which did ok, after I had lightly gone over my face with a cheap 2-blade disposable.My razor(s) had been left on our last vacation and I picked up this one at WalMart expecting to return it. WOW!It seems kinda cheaply made at first - very light, not much vroom in the motor, etc. But when the first charge lasted 5 weeks I understood why! It really doesn't take much power to spin the blades fast (good gearing) or cut one day of whiskers. It really is a joy to own. For a week long vacation you don't even need to take the stand.My favorite part is the ergonomic design of the whole body - an S shape that fits comfortably in your hand up or down or sides.And yes the shave for my medium beard is VERY close! No more disposables!!I certainly I hope I can replace the battery!"
4,Electric Shaver,"Shaver shaves very close, almost as good as a blade. This is my 1st electric razor and I am sure it will do 99% of what a blade will do in half the time. I am quite satisfied with the overall results and will most likely buy another before going back to a blade."
3,5 O'clock Shadow,"Update: Still going strong after almost 3 1/2 years...to get a better shave I've started using Electric Shave...it helps. Next time I'll still look for an electric razor that shaves close enough without Electric Shave.I've used this razor for almost 6 months. Sorry, it just does not shave close enough, and I always get a 5 o'clock shadow. The Remington I purchased in 1998 shaves closer (I've replaced the blade a few times), but the battery is long dead and only works if plugged in; hence the new purchase. Also, the trimmer is nearly useless...I still use the Remington for trimming.On the plus side, the rinse feature is outstanding and it is very quiet.Wish I could have tried before I bought...I will next time."
3,ok but shave not as fast as they say,"I bought this as an upgrade, I wanted a quicker shave. This does not do that especially on the neck areas. My remington was much quicker for that. It is easy to clean. It cuts close but you do have to spend the time"
4,no problems,I have had this shaver for about three weeks now. It works very fine right out of the box. was fully charged ready to go. I am very pleased with thsi razor.
2,my review,"Very happy with it's performance, however it's ability to hold a consistant charge is less than what I would expect from Norelco."
2,"Good Razor, but Panasonic Linear Razor is much better","I bought this razor as my second Norelco razor. The RPMs on this thing are very slow. You can get a decent shave, but takes a while to get the stubborn curved hairs. I've since then bought a Panasonic Linear Motor Razor and it works much better!!"
2,"Lightweight, cheap construction, poor design tradeoffs","Norelco has definitely gone downhill since being acquired by Phillips.This unit is too light and cheaply built. The engineers opted for light, quiet, and battery capacity at the expense of sturdy, efficient, and useful.The blades spin much more slowly than with previous models. I am sure this makes it quieter and makes the batteries last longer (friction being proportional to the cube of velocity?), but the shave is not as good and it pulls at times.Make the blades go faster. Put in a bigger battery or accept a shorter time between charges."
3,"Good product, not ideal...","I haven't had used an electric shaver in many years, and this model was a pleasant surprise in some ways: It is extremely silent, and easy to take care of (you can put it in running water w/no problem). The shave is also very close, which is basically what I was looking for.A big downside for me is that the shaver doesnt work as well in tricky places (e.g., neck), so I need to shave the same area many times and the skin gets a bit irritated. Overall a good buy, but technology is not there yet for me to completely discard my manual razor."
4,It works very good,"I bought it for my husband and he said that It works very well, charge lasts a long time. But he wish it had more power like his old Norelco shaver."
5,"Great product, great price",Bought this for my 17 year old. Great starter. Wish I had waited a week or so till it was a gold box item though...missed that one.
3,Some improvement,"I have shaved with Norelco shavers for about 20 years and the 8140XL is what might be called an incremental improvement over the 835RX that I have had for years. The 8140 gives me a slightly closer, and a little more comfortable shave, but not a great improvement in these areas. The 8140 is certainly lighter and quieter, and gives me more shaves per battery recharge. I suspect it won't last as long as the 835, but only time will tell. Knowing what I know now I probably would have waited till the 835 stopped working to buy a new razor but would still have purchased the 8140."
4,Good performer . . . for an electric,"I'ved used electric shavers basically all of my adult life. None have been perfect and none have been lousy. This one is no exception. If you've been using an electric and are just looking for a replacement (as I was), this is a fine choice. If you're a blade user and looking to convert to electric, this one isn't going to win you over, most likely.Good points:holds charge for 10 days!easy to cleanlightweight and good contour for holdingdecent, if not perfect, shaveBad points:Not as close as a bladeNo warning when the battery is about to die. It just stops. Fortunately, if you charge it for a couple of minutes, you can finish your shave."
3,No Low Battery Indicator,"This is a great razor. It shaves close, quickly, and it is easy to clean. Open it and just run the water through it. This particular model has one huge disadvantage, however. There is no low battery indicator. You either have to leave it plugged in, which, according to the instructions will shorten the battery life, or guess when it's going to run out of juice."
4,Broke but was replace under warranty,I used this for about 2 months and the battery died. Called philips and they replaced it within a week. You count on them making it right if its no good.
4,"Awesome product, great shave","I bought this shaver for an uncle on his Bday and he just loved it. It works well, is washable, easy to grip and handle. The charge lasts for long and charges quick. Great buy for the price."
1,Norelco 8140XL VERY DISSAPOINTED,"This was the worst razor I have ever used, was very excited to get it but when I did I charged it and the first time I used it spent 20 min trying to get a decent shave. Then I opened it up and was hard pressed to find any hair. This thing is so underpowered that if you press the foils to hard against your face it will acculy stop the cutters on a fully charged razor. I will never buy another Norelco Product I had this thing on Ebay the next day."
4,Wow that's close,"I used to use a Remington. I've had it for six years and decided since the battery was going bad / I broke the trimmer a long time ago that I needed a new one.I got this one from Walmart, which I always do and then find it on here cheaper. ... serves me right.I used it for the first time tonight. It cut wonderfully. Closer than my Remington ever did. In parts it looks/feels like I shaved w/ a straight edge, which is great. I am having quite a bit of razer burn, but that's absolutely expected. Hopefully it does go away, but Philips has a 60 day guarantee. Buy it and if you hate it you can fill out a form and they'll refund your purchase. It can't get any more simple than that. All the others have 30 days. They give a full 60 to make DARN sure you hate the thing before sending it back. I'm giving it the full 21 day suggested break-in, and hopefully it does me good."
5,Always Norelco!,I've been shaving for 35+ years. I've used all methods and a few different electric razors. Since the first Norelco razor I haven't gone anywhere else. With the new one I just purchased the shave has gotten even better! Way to go Norelco!
3,"Good, but not great","I bought this razor to replace a literally 12 year old Norelco. Frankly, not much has changed over 12 years. Cutting quality is the same (sad, when as I'm comparing against never oiled, never cleaned 12 year old razor). I do like the easy-cleaning, washable heads... this is worth the upgrade."
1,aw...so bad...,it's the worst shaver I've ever had.I've been hurt so badly. I'm planning to return it.
2,I regret having purchased this shaver.,I find that I don't get a shave that is any closer than I got from my old Remington.I also feel that the MSRP on this item warrants an alert when the battery gets low.A personal family problem caused me to bypass the 60 day return warranty.(Don't get old: let them shoot you first!)
1,Husband enjoys shaving,I bought this shaver for my husband. He had one exactly like it but after a number of years it finally broke. He really likes it. It saves him time in the morning.
2,Time consuming and poor shave.,"It takes me now three times longer than with a blade razor to even get rid of all the long hairs. My face has less irritation, but having to go through and individually ""fluff up"" hairs that are lying down so that I can shave them off is ridiculous and probably offsets entirely the benefit of not shaving off the top layer of skin on my face every morning. Additionally, of course, the final shave isn't nearly as close as with a blade, but I expected that. What I did not expect was the razor's complete inability to shave long hairs without manual assistance from tweezers.I remember having a previous model razor of the same type when I was in high school that worked much better. I expected this one to work even better than that, as it's more modern. No such luck, this new one did a far worse job of shaving effectively than a 7 year old razor."
2,not for me...,"I bought this product because I wanted to use an electric shaver in between my normal days of shaving with a razor...shaving has never been such a chore! I literally never use it because it takes me at least 15 minutes to get a decent shave, and even then it's nowhere near as close as my normal shave with a blade."
2,Advertized great but noway better than razors,"The shipment came on time. I did use it as per the instructions, it shave was poor, discomfortable, burning face. Not worthy for the money spent. I'm not using it any more"
2,an alright piece if all you want is a an ok shave,"This was a disappointment. Bought this based on the reviews but its performance was only ok, it does not shave close and causes a lot of burn. I thought the skin burn would be gone after using it for a while but it does not. It does not come any close to a razor shave. Ok for quick use and an ok shave though."
3,Expected More...,"I had a Norelco triple header with height adjustment for eight years. It gave a close shave, but I had to work at it, especially the neck area. I got my money's worth and more given the trouble free service and I didn't have to replace the blades. The 8140XL is performing the same in terms of quality of shave and speed. I expected more given the hype of the triple rows of blades w/in the each of the three heads. Water cleaning works well. Much quieter than previous one. I get 3 to 4 shaves from a charge. The 8150 model offers a ""need to recharge"" light. The 8140 does not, and it just stops w/o warning so better have the charger handy. Hard to believe that Norelco can justify a higher price just for the convenience of a charge warning light."
1,A Waste of Money,"I bought this electric thinking I would get a closer shave than a blade. Wrong! The instruction say give it 3 weeks to get broken in. Its been 3, now 4 momths and the shaver barely trims my one day growth ( and I do not have a heavy beard). I have to use a blade to finish the job anyway, so why do I need to pay for this thing? It is horrible and a waste of money. Its not worth shaving twice so this is going into the garbage basket. I've been ripped off to the tune of $150."
2,Not as good as previous models,"While this shaver seems to give a quick shave, it does not shave as closely as earlier Norelco models. This particular model does not tell you when the battery needs recharging."
1,WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT!!!,I have been using Norelco shavers for 40 years and when I saw the deal on the triple head at Sam's Club I decided to retire my 10 year old Norelco. A mistake! I should have taken advantage of the 30 day test period because I am not satisfied and am back using my old shaver. Using the new shaver takes 2 or 3 times as long and even then I miss spots. The overall shave is not nearly as close. The Sam's club version does not come with a stand so I have to store the shaver in a glass. I called Norelco and a stand in not available as a seperate item.The triple shaving heads are not nearly as effective as the old one and are just a marketing gimick.If you are currently using an older Norelco triple header the 8140 will be disapointing.Thanks.
3,Nothing Great,"After using this shaver for 2 years now, I feel it is quicker to shave a disposable razor. This razor takes as long, if not longer to shave with than the time it takes to prep your face with shave cream, shave, and rinse. It is doesn't actually shave close enough to give a smooth shave either."
3,Don't expect much from this shaver,"Shop around if you are looking for a good quality shaver. There is nothing special about this shaver. I read great reviews, perhaps I expected too much."
5,fantastic little box,"nice and small , does alot fast being acomputer user for years this is our first palm , very satisfied"
5,Excellent Video of BUD/S,Great video. Gives a good impression of how tough life can be on BUD/S trainees. Inspiring. Makes you want to join!
2,Would not recommend,This was a bit of a disappointment. I watched the DVD once and gave it as a present to a friend. They just give you some basic insight into the BUD without the real thing. The BUD training sessions are just the real basics and the heavy ie. interesting parts are missing (i.e. snipers or exercises with other foreign allied units). Would not recommend.
5,Awesome documentary,"Great price, very informative. Gifted it to my parents so they'll have an idea of what I'm heading into. HOOYAH NAVY!"
4,Good machine for the price,This machine is pretty good for the price. It was easy to assemble and gives a good workout. The only negative thing is that I can't get one of the pedal hinge bolts that connects the pedal to the crankshaft super tight so it keeps loosening up after each workout. Having to re-tighten it constantly. Think it was a stripped bolt already. I plan on getting another bolt from the hardware store to hopefully solve this problem. Other than that I think this is a great machine and worth the money.
1,"Missing parts, completely unusable","Missing pedals, missing tons of parts, have had five different people look at it and all come up with the conclusion that they probably only shipped about half of the parts necessary to assemble this."
4,good machine,"this machine is made well and is a full size. i bought it for my mother in law who is overwieght for 20 years and starting to have all kinds of health problems. she is 5 feet 0 and the machine is a little too big as far as seet height and reaching the handles. it is good for her because she can ride sitting down and then she is forced to stand to use the handles, but the machine is comfortable enough she has been using it for two months 5 times a week and the wieght is coming off. i recomend this machine for anyone who is heavy and looking for an easier way to live better"
3,Somewhat pleased,"I am a beginner to exercising. I am completely out of shape. I have tried lots of different exercises and have found them to be too difficult for me at the beginner stage. However, I love the elliptical/bike trainer. I was able to bike 5 miles the very first day. I think that for a starter machine it is excellent. I feel that I will need to trade up as I become healthier. I don't think that the machine was built to last long. The second day I used it the machine started to make a clicking noise. I haven't figured out where it is coming from but I am concerned that it indicates a breakage. I also disliked the instructions. My daughter and I took almost two hours to put it together. We had to follow the pictures because the written instructions were almost illegible."
3,Decent,"Shipping was fast. Everything arrived in good condition and was easy to assemble. Comfortable when used as an elliptical. When used as a bike, it'd be nice if the pedals had footstraps and the seat could be moved closed to the handles.Definitely worth the price for beginners who are looking just looking for something functional, but lacks the features that experienced users will be looking for."
4,This is a great machine for the price.,A great machine for the price. I don't really have any complaints about this product yet. My only problem with the machine is that it causes a lot of floor vibration when used as an elliptical. (I live in a 2nd floor apartment) Putting a rug under the machine helped solve this problem.
1,very disappointing,Had to call because the instructions didn't show how to install one of the main bolts and it said to install #43...there wasn't a part #43. Didn't get any help. Finally figured out the tubes were too long (or the bolt was too short) It shredded the washers. Ground the tubes shorter and it worked ok. Also had to re-drill the holes in the handles because they were at the wrong angle. Then the nut that holds the pedals in came loose. Got that fixed and then one of the pedals broke off the frame. The plastic is very brittle and breaks easily. Made a wooden pedal and then the gears inside broke. All this in about a month. Took it apart and separated the metal from the plastic and hauled to the recycling center. My advice? Don't waste the $139....they say you get what you pay for but in this case I think this is even less than what I paid for.
1,Caution,Vor kurzem schrieb ich dass das Gerät super ist. Falsch. Das Gerät hat drei Monate funktioniert und jetzt ist es ganz kaputt. Weiches Metall. Lieber mehr Geld bezahlen um bessere Quallität zu haben. Ich würde das Gerät nie wieder kaufen. Sehr billig und sehr schlechte Verarbeitung. Material ist schlecht.I recently wrote that the device is great. Wrong. The unit has worked for three months and now it is completely broken. Soft metal. Prefer to have more money to pay for better quality first. I would purchase it again. Very cheap and very poor workmanship. Material is poor.
5,Love the 2 in 1 !,"I am so glad to have purchased the bike. It is heavy and stable, occasionally after a lot of use, you may need to tighten the arm , but takes a second to reach down and turn the knob. It definitely gives a good work-out, makes the heart pump faster, and is worth much more than paid. This is a super bargain price !"
1,2 in 1 Elliptical Cross Trainer & Exercise Bike,"When I purchased the machine on 4/16/08 it was missing the large screws for the steps. I contacted the company and waited another seven days for the two screws to come. I tried putting the screws in only to find out that they do not fit the machine. I had this machine for over a month and still could not use it. This is a HORRIBLE MACHINE and I advise any and everyone to stay away from purchasing it. I thought that it was a deal however, I ended up giving away $110.00 dollars to this company. I am very disappointed by the company that is selling this as well as Amazon for having it on their site. What a waste of money. I was going to send it back, but I do not have the orginal packaging and it will cost me more money then I have to send back. This machine needs to be taken off of the site, FOR GOOD. I am so sad that I wasted my money and I do not have anymore to purchase something else that works as I am a single mom on a fixed income.Helpless in CT"
1,Unbelievable,"After a month of waiting, and contacting Golf Outlets twice, I still hadn't received the trainer, and the last I heard was a response of ""I'll get back to you"" which never happened. I contacted Amazon and told them to cancel the order, that I'd given up after waiting for a MONTH after it was supposed to be delivered.Amazon replied and refunded the cost of the trainer.4 days later, I received an automated email from Golf Outlets that my order had been shipped! They didn't even expedite the shipping, just sent it via UPS ground. I would definitely think twice about ordering from them in the future."
4,Happy Rider,"I love this machine, after 2 weeks I lost about 3-4 inches all around. The only issue I'm having with it is, the left pedal keeps seizing up when I go in reverse. I noticed the pedal got very hot and stopped moving all together, I eventually got it working again by loosening the screw and tightening it up. I love this machine because it works your entire body and it is light weight and easy to move."
2,Confidence Fitness 2-in-1 Elliptical Trainer with Seat,Not very stury. Petal keeps on coming unscrewed. I prefer using the bike vs. the elliptical. I would only recommend this item if you have a small budget.
1,elliptical,This is a pathetic piece of equipment. I rated it one star only b/c there are no negative stars. It has already broken. May have used it ten times.
3,It Serves its purpose,"It squeaks so maybe I need some oil for it or something, but other than that it serves it's purpose. I can ride or sit and I get a good sweat out on. Be sure when you purchase to check ALL ur peices before even attempting to put together. Otherwise like me you'll end up with something shattered and not find out until you can't fit it back in the box."
3,assembly less than desired,"Once this machine is put together, it is a wonderful addition to my work-out routine. But, if it weren't for a friend with a re-threader tool, this would have sat in the corner of my room in pieces for years. The bolts were all threaded incorrectly which in turn made it impossible to put together."
3,"It's okay, but keep your tools handy!","Considering the low price, this has been a good buy for the money. The assembly instructions were difficult to follow (as others have pointed out). Thankfully my husband is experienced in that area, and we were able to get it assembled in about an hour. I have used it for a few minutes almost every day for the past few weeks; so it has 2-3 hours of time on it so far. Even though I only weigh 150 and use the machine gently, I have had some trouble with the nuts and bolts working themselves loose and falling off(especially the right handlebar and the left foot pedal), so I keep the assembly wrenches next to it and make sure everything is tightened before I use it.I have not used the bike seat much, but I am 5'8"" and it is a long reach to the handlebars for me."
3,Nice bike...,"I like this product. It works really well and its versatile. The only problem is that the sensor for the monitor computer flew off after about two weeks of use. Now it doesn't read out, but the bike functions well. Assembly was easy, too. I recommend the bike but don't rely on the monitor."
4,Not bad,This is an inexpensive compact exercise bike. Since I'm in an apartment and don't have a lot of room it is what I wanted. On the other hand the bike isn't as sturdy as it could be. Also the motion of the peddles is not very natural. Over all I'd say it was a good deal for what it is. If you want something nicer go for a higher price point.
3,Alright,"I've had it for about a year now and it has held up pretty well. Recently the friction belt broke off from all the friction. Now the equipment is practically useless without the tension on the wheels. I have to go ""35 mph"" or more to even break a sweat. I tried to see if I could reorder the part from Confidence Fitness and they don't have a website or a number to call!Other things you should know: I constantly have to re-tighten screws! Things get loosened up and I find myself having to tighten the screws that attach to the arms about 10x each workout. Tightening the screws helps reduce the noise but it's still pretty loud.Update: The phone number for Confidence Fitness is 18006030004 if anyone needs it. I called to reorder the friction belt and they are sending it for free...yay!"
1,Quality poorly,"I ordered and used it for few months. After six (6) months later, fallen apart and plus, some not looked equally figure. Looks like some delivery may have dropped and hit. I am pretty upset about it. Wheel flyer (black) were very loose. I have to adjustment and tight them up otherwise could hurt. Reason, I bought this because of lowest price and also, looks very similiar I used to have one it's called 'Orbitrek'. Orbitrek, I used over four (4) years. I paid almost $250 & used lot of times than second. I didn't think would last longer."
4,Elliptical Bike,Im satisfied. I'm able to use it as a bike and elliptical. Its a bit unsteady after a few uses and my arms are short so its hard when it extends. For the most part its worth the money.
3,2 in 1 Elliptical Cross Trainer,It gives a great workout and doesn't take up alot of room. It takes a while to get used to the elliptical function but once you do here comes your workout.This is a wonderful machine.
2,Not What I expected,"Well I can say the machine fits perfectly in the corner. I have been on the machine twice and its not for me. It doesnt glide like an eliptical, it more paddles up and down like a bike. Being that the peddals are on an angle it is not so comfortable on the feet and ankles because the feet keep sliding to the front and hitting the top of the peddal. Also, the bars are not adjustable so if your arms are not long as a monkey's arm you wont reach (I cant reach them and remain seated). Finally, I think some parts were missing because the clock doesnt fit on the equipment so it's in the drawer. HOWEVER, it looks really cool in my corner, so it looks like I have something good going on.!"
1,Cross Trainer Elliptical has missing parts,The Elliptical that was ordered through Amazon.com from Golf Outlets of America was missing important parts and could not be completely assembled. Phoned G.O.A. and asked for parts. They were not shipped. Emailed G.O.A to remind them that parts were not received and that I was going to return the Elliptical. Received an email from UPS that package was being delivered from G.O.A. Should be receiving parts 30 days after receiving the Elliptical. Hope parts are correct. Then I can actually review the product.
1,waste of money,"After 2 months of use, the front wheel became loose and started making a strange grinding noise. It got louder and louder and the screws left black powder on my carpet. Do not buy."
5,Never thought,"Never thought I'd workout, but I do! I like it I found this item and can watch all my favorite shows and workout at the same time. Quiet and works well!"
2,Very poor quality,Confidence Fitness 2-in-1 Elliptical Trainer with SeatFoot padels are made with very cheap plastic. Breaking apart during assembly.Spent two/three hours assmbling this equipment when before i use noticed holes on the padels were broken/cracked and came apart.Poor workmanship for the part of assembly done by sender/seller.May be bad piece of equipment.
2,no confidence Fittness,"The problem with this device is the incomplete assembly, which leads to a wrong assembly.Once the device is wrong assembled there is no fun with the device at all, because the screws will loosens easily and the whole device starts to scream so it will be very noisy.A better description or a better pre-assembly could avoid such a hustle.The crosstrainer works just as crosstrainer, but I guess it is not well engineered, because of my expirience on profie Crosstrainers, where a better use of the force could be achieved.The bike function works fine meanwhile the pedals are not really pedals for a bike, but it is possible to sit in a relaxed way on the device and to pedal some minutes, this is good for the cool down period of the training.The bike option also works with less hustle than the cross trainer.Summary:If the device would have been better preassembled it is an ok trainer for the bad weather season and not on a regular training.CheersUlf Moebus"
1,PACKAGED HORRIBLY!,"I was looking forward to get this. I knew that it would not be top of the line because I only paid 140 for it. But All the screws and everything were just thrown into the box, and so was everything else. For this reason alot of the smaller pieces were broken. I am more disappointed because it does not even give me an option to contact seller, so now I am stuck with broken pieces and something that does not work correctly. Do not order from this seller because you will not be able to contact them once it ships out."
3,"Doesn't deserve 2 in 1 title, mostly just a bike","Got the Bike and put it together. It was a little hard to do. And as a female, I am very mechanically inclined but I really had to wait until my husband could help me to get the parts lined up and bolts screwed in.After getting it together, I have used it and was really looking forward to using it as the elliptical cross trainer. I find this very hard to do because the angle of the pedals are very steep compared to other elliptical trainers that I have seen. Works okay as a bike though. Even though I can't ride long. THe seat kills my rear."
2,The Trouble With Washers,"After just one use, I loved this bike. Since I'm somewhat out of shape, having the ability to ride the bike allows me to extend my workout and keep my heart rate up for longer than I could with just a straight elliptical. However, after about 2 months of use, the washers between the bars securing the handles to the foot pedals broke off and now the entire machine creaks and wobbles, especially at high speeds. Thinking that I just needed to replace the washers, I've been on a month long search of every hardware store in my city that has been in vain. I've not yet been able to find washers even close to what I need. Even searching online has yet yielded results. I love the machine and think it was somewhat worth the money I spent, but having this little detail go wrong and prove unsolvable is totally disappointing."
2,I am very disapointed in this machine.,"I have had this machine sine April 2007. It started out great. It is now June 2007 and out of no where there begins this grinding noie. It is awful and distracting to my workout. My husband took it apart to see if he could find the problem, he is pretty machanically inclined and even he could not find where this nerve wreching sound was coming from. He asked if I had a warrenty on it. I did not receive a warrenty along with this item. I have used this machine everyday since I received it. It is entirely to early for this machine to be breaking down. I feel like I just threw money away. It is very important to know that you get what you pay for. Very Disapointed."
1,broken,this is a terrible piece of machinery within a week of having it i had to take it apart multiple times to try and fix the problems...i would start on it and something would break within a couple minutes so instead of trying to work out i end up pulling out my tools and fixing it. first the bearings were super loose and even after tightening them they would loosen up and cause a jerking feeling when it was going. Both the pedal things broke off because they were made of a chincy plastic and only bolted in two spots. The chain would loosen up while i was on it and cause chain slippage and start making little metal files on the floor from the gear sprockets...and now the last thing the way it was designed in general is flawed one of the bolts holding the pedal arms on was threaded into the rear i dunno pedal assembly i would call it and all the thread on the bolt thread are worn off.
1,terrible,I broke it already. The wheel was not set directly in the center and rubbed against the plastic sides causing much dust each use. The numbers on the tracker are faded and you can only see half of them.
3,Product worth the cost,"Product is what you would expect for the price. It is not well made and makes a few creaks but works fairly well. I didn't expect this item to be as well made as an expensive one but it does work well. It took about an hour to put together, not very difficult. It is too small for my husband (especially the foot pedals) but it gives me a great workout."
4,Very pleased,"A little difficult to put together, but not as hard as I feared. My only disappointment thus far is that my size 11 1/2 feet seem a bit too large for the pedals. Besides that it is easy to operate and works well."
5,Elliptical Cross-Trainer,"I bought the Confidence Fitness 2-in-1 Elliptical Trainer with Seat and must say that it is a perfect cardo workout with an upper body workout included. It was an easy machine to assemble, as Confidence Fitness provided both the instruction with assembly and a very helpful multi-tool. It took me less than an hour to complete. I workout 30 minutes- three times a week with this machine: 5 minutes with the Elliptical, 5 minutes with the Exercise Bike, 10 minutes with the Elliptical and then 10 minutes with the Exercise Bike per session for a total of 30 minutes. Wow! What a great workout for your heart, lungs, quadriceps, knees, arms and shoulders. I would give this Elliptical Cross-Trainer an A+, meaning Excellent Plus!! I have had a lot of different cardio machines over the years, but this Elliptical Cross-Trainer is the best."
1,"Horrid, horrid product.","The only saving grace on this is that Confidence Fitness has sent me replacement parts for everything that's broken on the unit since I got it. The day after I got the machine, the left pedal broke. The whole time I had problems with the nut coming off as I exercised. I dealt with it, but after some frustration I called and ordered a new nut and bolt for the left pedal as well. THe company shipped me the right nut, which wouldn't be a big deal, but I am seriously sick of having to skip my workout to order more parts and fix the bike. This is a cheap unit for a reason, if you're willing to deal with grease and constant headaches, this might make the grade until you can replace it with a higher quality unit."
1,LOUD piece of junk,"This thing is a pain to put together and after a week of regular use it got really loud - squeaking, clanking, the works. The adjustability knob is a joke - the machine seems to get harder and easier randomly. I guess I get a workout when I'm on it, but the horrible noises make it impossible to watch TV or anything while I'm on it, even with head phones on. All in all, don't waste your money."
1,Crap...,"My wife and I purchased this machine a couple of months ago, and in a short period of time it has become unusable. It's literally fallen apart."
2,it was only good the first wk,"It worked fine the first wk, but today it started to make a horrible noise, and I can't fix itIt skeaks and seems it's going to fall apart. What else can I expect from a eliptical worth135 USD??"
4,Really happy,"I'm really happy with this machine. It's actually better than I expected for the price. I took a star off because there was a big crack in the plastic on the side when it arrived. It wasn't a vital part or anything, so I just accepted it. Also, when you're using it while seated, it's a little awkward to lean forward and use the handles. But it's not too bad. Overall, I think I made a good choice in buying it, and I would recommend it to others."
1,Avoid this product if you can....,"I bought it as a replacement for the broken 5-years old IBM branded 2.4GHz cordless phone. It's is a total disappointment. The phone is placed in the same position as the old one. However, when making or receiving a call, all you can hear is noise and static. This really puzzled me, why a 5 years old phone can handle the RF interference much better?I tried to move the base around, it does improve the quality of the call, but noise still comes up when I stand in front of windows or under a door frame. My 1 bedroom apartment room is not big at all, image what could happen when this phone is used in a house.Bottom line - try to avoid it if you can."
2,Unacceptable Sound Quality,"The sound quality of this phone was unacceptable. Although the other party to the phone call could not hear it, my line suffered from static and other signal interference. Using the channel button on the phone did not resolve the issue, but switching to a different cordless phone fixed the problem. The answering machine worked as advertised, but without good sound quality, what's the point?"
4,"Not super, very good","The best feature of this answering machine? It doesn't record junk phone calls. Otherwise, it is your run-of-the-mill answering machine. It answers calls and records messages. That is exactly what we wanted it to do and it does it."
5,Absolutely breathtaking,"Diahann Carroll sings and interprets the hell out of these standards. Her voice is like honey and her jazz phrasing is impeccable. If you love Dinah Washington or Nancy Wilson, you will love Dianhann singing jazz."
4,Fun to hear,"This is a double disc - the first 12 cuts are an album Diahann recorded with Andre Previn in 1960 (which is why I bought the disc) .These songs are great - people are unaware that this woman had great style and was a polished performer - this kind of singing disappeared long ago - it was the days when originality was encouraged - and these folks showed respect for their matterial. She's in great form on these cuts, she shows off shamelessly, but that's okay (I wouldn't be surprised if the young Barbra Streisand listened to her!) However, the rest of the disc is a date she played in a New York club - here it all falls apart. But I recommend the disc anyway, just for the first 12 cuts."
3,pkay baby jane stlye thriller,"the plot is interesting and talullah bankhead and stephanie powers are superb and it is atmospheric, but the film drags along and often moves too slowly to be the riveting thriller that it could and should have been."
3,The dahling Bankhead's finest hour on celluloid.,"Tallulah Bankhead is magnificent in her final screen role as a religious fanatic who kidnaps and torments the pretty young dauhter-in-law(Stefanie Powers) she holds responsible for her son's death. This Gothic chiller from Britain's Hammer Films is one of the studio's finest psychological thrillers richly enhanced by the mighty Bankhead's macabre, all-out portrayal which makes this film rank right up there with PSYCHO/BABY JANE, and the other popular shockers of its day. The screenplay was written by Sci-fi/horror master Richard Matheson(THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE)."
1,This is not a steely dan concert!,"This dvd is nothing more than a instructional vidio on how to play the guitar like steely dan.I got fooled by buying it,I hope nobody else does. A.GOODWIN"
1,SongXpress:Steely Dan,"Do NOT buy this unless you are a musician interested in learning a couple of average songs.This DVD is NOT a concert,or performance of Steely Dan.Learn from my mistake.I'll take one for the team."
1,Big RIP OFF!,"What a rip off. I bought this DVD BECAUSE I was a guitarist and I wanted to learn how to play the tasty jazz licks from Reeling in the Years. The instructor plays them and then says: those are the solo licks, but we're not going to learn to play them. WHAT? Instead he shows you how to play the rythmn parts and then the segment ends with him and some guy murdering the song. Instead of wasting our time with some crappy performance, why not take the time to show us how to play the rest of the song. It's obvious you KNOW how to play the solos so why not SHOW me what I paid money for. I'm horribly DISAPPOINTED. One of the worst instructional DVDs ever."
1,Wrong blade wrong shipping!,"I orded this blade through Amazon.com about 2 months ago. According to Amazon this blade should have a 1/2 arbor, but it has a 10mm arbor. I've checked and checked, but Amazon.com and Grizzley list this blade as a 1/2 inch arbor. Of course I can't return it as it's been floating around the truck for 2 months. I'm ordering another, but we'll see."
5,Great Value,"[..]LCD quality is great. After reading some reviews, I was somewhat skeptical about changing the picture settings, but once I received my tv, it was simple to adjust settings to my liking, and if you want to restore defaults, you simply select the button. I've seen reviews complainning about the on and off sound/melody? Well, spend 2 minutes playing with your tv and you will find all these options to be quite simple. A 5 year old could use this television. This tv is well worth the $, I would have paid a couple hundred dollars more and still would feel I got a good deal. Check bestbuy and circuit city, and you will see the HUGE difference in cost. They carry the same tv, so go check it out before you buy. I've had this product a month and have no complaints what-so-ever. My xbox360 looks great, my pc connects seamlessly, and the 3 hdmi connections are very useful."
2,Great... when it works,"Received this TV in late November, but didn't have any HD sources until later on in December. The picture is amazing in HD, when it works. Unfortunately, most of the time the screen is covered in pink and green dots that clearly shouldn't be there. Sometimes, after about 20 - 30 minutes, these clear away and the picture is great. Samsung is supposed to fix it on 3 Jan, so we'll see what happens after that.Update: TV was fixed under warranty today and looks great! Samsung gave me no hassle in getting it fixed, so I'll give this product 4 stars now."
3,"slow response, and refresh rate",I was disappointed in this lcd with the slow response rate and refresh rates. Sports definitely had a 'blur' aspect in the crowds... will remember to go to Sharp or Sony in the future.
1,airzone trampoline,"I ordered an Airzone trampoline through amazon and it arrived with only half the springs enclosed. So now I have a partially assembled, unsafe trampoline driving my daughter crazy with temptation and consequent nagging. Plus, I paid someone to help me assemble it. I just waited on hold for a over 2 hours then got disconneted but Amazon totally passed the buck. I am so angry I will never order from Amazon again!"
5,Overall great purchase,"Quality of the the TV is excellent. HD channels look awesome. So far I can say that glare is not an issue and I have a pretty bright living room. I have seen many other TV's which have some ghosting, but I can say with this set there has been absolutely none. Price was unbeatable.Delivery was great, I called Eagle once Amazon had listed the package as delivered and set up an appointment. They originally gave me a 5 hour window, but asked if they could narrow the window and they did so by making it a 3 hour window. Delivery guy gave me no problem when I made him wait while I turned on the TV and checked everything out (looked for dead pixels, etc.).Overall excellent, highly recommended."
3,not what I expected,"I purchased this tv 12,27,07 and every thing was great for 16 months, then a vertical line appeared on the screen that would not go away. after researching this problem on line I found that this is a ongoing problem with this model. I tried to contact samsung without any response from them. Now in addition to this problem it is very slow to start up and some times will not until after several attempts.At other times it will display multitudes of vertical lines. for this reason I will never buy another samsung product."
2,Great when it worked,"This TV looks fantastic when it is working. It is so bright I would not put it in a bed room, it will wake you up. However about one (1) year after I bought it, the screen had to be replaced. It just made warranty. Now seven (7) months later and out of warranty, the TV is out again! I am looking for a way to repair it myself because they want $500.00 to repair it. I made everyone I know get Samsung LCDs. One of the other LCD with a different model number had similar problem after about two (2) years after he bought his."
5,Great TV even after 2 years,I have had this TV for almost 2 years and it has held up wonderfully over time. Granted it doesnt have some of the newer features like 120Hz and MotionPlus but the picture is still on par with many of the newer TVs being made this year. However I hope this post will make a new favorite Samsung TV show up in my GoldBox at a good price!
1,Samsung has a problem with this product,"This HDTV has been in the shop for most of the two months since I purchased it. The video portion goes completely blank and stays that way from one day to permanently. Samsung has had me use two different local authorized repair shops, and it is obvious they have no idea what the problem is. They fix the problem and then the same thing reoccurs. Samsung says that only the authorized TV repair shops can recommend that it be replaced, and the TV repair shops say that only Samsung can authorize replacing it. I also wrote to Amazon about the problem and they haven't bothered to respond. So I have spent over $2,000 and most of the time the product does not function and Samsung and Amazon have not been able or willing to resolve the problem."
4,Very solid - I am pleased with my investment,"Most people do not consider a television an investment, but I do - the TV is an investment in improving the quality of my leisure time.This Samsung TV is an excellent product but it took a number of hours to get everything configured the way I wanted. I purchased a Samsung home theater system to improve the sound and it was worth it! The TV and the home theater complement each other particularly when playing video games.A few caveats - I played the XBOX 360 for several days before I remembered to set the resolution to the highest available on the XBOX. What a difference! If you don't feed the TV high definition/resolution signals using component or HDMI cables, you'll be missing out and wonder what all the fuss is about.If you take the time to set up all your components this TV produces a wonderful crisp image. It has all the connectors you will probably ever need."
2,BIG PROBLEM! intermittant video from HMDI port,"Video via the HMDI port, I loose video and picture goes black intermittantly, have to turn TV off and back on again to get video back. Samung and repair think it's a software version issue in the TV. Samsung sent repair service, unable to solve video issue!. Samsungs's repair service is scheduled to try a second attempt at a fix!On a posative note, when the HMDI port works, I get a good picture!"
5,Great LCD for the money,"This TV is one of the most beautiful lcd's I have ever seen,I was scared at first when I read this TV suffered HDMI problems with the PS3,so far so good with the ps3 as my blue ray player it is awesome.I also have the HD DVD Toshiba A2 which looks great on this set to.My order went flawlessly no problems with Amazon or the shipping company it only took 4 days to get here.I don't have any problems with TV for [...]$ free shipping I think its the best deal on the net,this tv retails for [...]$ at my local CC.So don't be afraid I will be using [...] for all my electronics from now on."
5,Best LCD TV for the money,"Had this TV for almost a year. It's a great unit with solid contrast, deep colors, great glossy finish, and plenty of features and connections. The unit is very light and never gets hot. It generates almost no static so there is no need to dust it, since very little dust ever sticks. It works great with both HD and standard definition channels.It does has some minor flaws including minor blurring during the fast moving scenes, however, most of the image flaws are the result of low quality HD signal. It works beautifully with the PS3 or Blu-Ray dvd HDMI input.It is by far the best value, just wait for the price on Amazon to go down to $1,600 and buy. By the way even if you bought it for more, you have the right to get a refund if the price goes down within 30 days after purchase, just call Amazon and they will refund your credit card."
1,clicking noise when starting up,"I purchased this TV three years ago. Like many of you, I did my research prior to buying this TV and decided on a Samsung based on the reviews found here. For the first year or so the TV worked great. Then it mysteriously turned on/off by itself. That problem stopped and a year or so later it developed a new problem...makes a clicking noise when I turn it on. At first the clicking noise lasted for a few minutes. It now takes more than 20 MINUTES for the picture to come on. Once it's on it's fine, but who wants to run the TV 24/7 to avoid the 20 minute start up time?!?!Will NOT buy another Samsung!!"
1,no good,lasted 2 1/2 years. Tv started taking long to turn on. Samsung replaced capacitors even though it was out of warranty. I then told the tech the picture wasn't the same. Next day I noticed 3 lines on right side of TV. Samsung won't repair or replace. Said it is a totally different problem. Well there shouldn't be any problems. No more samsung for me. $1600 down the drain. Well after much arguing back and forth with Samsung they sent someone out to look at my TV again. They told me it was a bad panel but they are going to replace. I am thankful they are replacing but a tv should last much longer than 2 1/2 years. Even the tv repair man said if Samsung was not going to cover I should just go buy a new TV. He said a panel replacement can be $1000.00
1,NOT GOING TO LAST LONG,I loved this tv up until it started malfunctioning after less than 2 years. It takes 3 plus minutes to turn on and getting slower. Trying to contact the manufacturer.
1,Beautiful TV with Quality Issues,"Like nearly all Samsung TVs, this TV looks good both on and off. Picture looked much better than comparably priced TVs on display at a large electronics store. Bought in December 2008, and TV worked well initially. After 5 months, the main board failed (TV display would not come on and several inputs simultaneously stopped working). After the warranty repair, TV worked well for 8 more months. Shortly after the warranty expired, the display would flicker several times within 10 seconds of being turned on, then remain off. Sound would continue to work, but no picture. Display occasionally would remain on, but required many attempts."
5,Extremely fast delivery / Excellent LCD tv,Ordered my LNT4665F on Monday and Eagle delivered to my house on Friday. Could not believe how fast it made it here with standard delivery. The guys were very helpful and friendly. The tv was in pristine condition and picture quality and ease of use are everything the reviews describe. I had heard the annoyances were the blue light on the front and the boot up/shut down music. Both turn off so not a problem. Connections were easier to get to and clearly marked. I am definitely a fan of both Amazon and Samsung now!
5,LNT4665F question,"This not a review, but a question for those of you that own one. I looked at one in the stores, and was impressed with the picture. My question deals with the asthetics. I'm seeing something in the pics online, that I don't remember at the store. There seems to be something along the sides, that I can't make out here. Is there a clear glass edge, or chrome edge that I'm seeing, or is that a reflection I'm seeing(don't think so). Is it the speakers? Any help appreciated, as I would like to make up my mind without having to go out to the stores again. Thanks"
2,dave,Power supply on all these TVs in weak and mine is going out ( it beeps on and off before I get picture) and I think they (Samsung ) should replace this circut board free. **2 year old TV***
3,Impressive picture! Bad power consumption rates! USB WISELINK needs movie clip .avi .mpg. .wmv abilitiy for good review.,Impressive picture! Bad power consumption rates! USB WISELINK needs movie clip .avi .mpg. .wmv abilitiy for good review.I bought one of these Samsung HD LCD TV's. I love the picture! I saw a news channel state that these new LCD tv's consume 2 to 3 times more electricity than regular tube or rear projection tv's. That is absolutely rediculous.The USB Wiselink is awesome except that it does not allow me to play .avi .mpg. .wmv video files. I can only slideshow pictures and thats it.
1,Great when it works (for less than 20 months),"Similar experience to lots of recent reviewers. The picture looks great on this LCD TV but ONLY when it works!! The display of the TV showed vertical multi color stripes after 20 months of usage. First it was intermittent upon power up, then it just became permanent. Also had the clicking sound / turning off on it's own problem, but that one just last for a few months.This really makes me put samsung at the bottom of the list for any major appliances consideration."
1,Do not buy a samsung TV,I bought this TV July 2007. After 14 months the TV LCD screen has died on me. It would cost me at least $1300 to get this TV fixed. DO NOT BUY!!!!!
5,1080 Samsung,"This is a great TV. Have had it about a month now. Easy to set up. The Screen POPS in HD. It's like looking through glass it's so real. Get it, you won't regret it."
5,An excellent product,"I had researched the internet for the latest 1080P LCD HDTV's and based on many reviews, I ordered this TV. It has proven to meet or exceed all the written reviews and my expectations. Samsung has included a very good users manual and a new purchaser should read and understand the entire manual to fully take advantages of it many settings and to fully enjoy this outstand product. I highly recomment this TV and Amazon as a purchasing outlet.Bill HatfieldUSA"
1,Lack luster customer service,"Be wary of buying anything refurbished or with ""minor cosmetic blemishes"" from WarehouseDeals. Their idea of minor cosmetic blemishes in my case equated to two very large 2-3 inch white cracks in my Samsung's black bezel. Furthermore, one of three HDMI ports was defective upon arrival. They decided to take another 10% off the purchase price (not including the shipping price) to ""correct"" this. Upon further testing, the VGA input is defective as well, as is the optical audio output. I am still awaiting response from customer service.Now I have several options:1. I return the TV altogether, having wasted several hundred dollars trying to make a broken TV work.2. Attempt to dump another couple of hundred dollars into a good HDMI A/V receiver for more connections for my cable box, PS3, and computer (as the VGA port doesn't work).3. Keep a broken TV, never buy from Warehouse Deals again, and learn my lesson about ""refurb w/ minor cosmetic blemishes."""
3,Very bright picture but poor shadow definition,"I researched very extensively and went to the store with the intention of buying this tv. Once I saw the picture first hand, the high contrast ratio was immediately evident - very bright almost candy like picture. After spending some time comparing to other units - I started to notice that although the brights were bright and the darks were dark - the shadow definition was very poor. Specifically - when there was a dark scene it was almost totally black and very hard to make out. Compared to the Sony KDL-46W3000, which I ended up buying, the Samsung picture looks unrealistic and crowded in the dark end of the spectrum. The Sony on the other hand, is able to reproduce a brighter picture but where it really shines is in its ability to create a more life like image with accuracy across the spectrum."
4,I RETURNED THIS TV,"We liked this TV but we were not thrilled with the picture quality. We would have kept it but then I saw that Amazon was offering a newer model that had BETTER SPECS and was CHEAPER so we decided to return it for the newer model. The newer model LN46A550P is listed on the same page as LNT4665F in the box that says a newer model of this item is available.Check it out, especially the reviews. Several other people returned the LNT4665F for the newer 550P and are thrilled with the improved quality. Again, better specs and cheaper!!! Buying the older model just does not make sense.The 550P is so much better for many reasons -- picture quality is unbelievable, the sound is better, non-glare screen, easier remote, no shadows especially with sports, better specs and again cheaper.Samsung does make a great TV so enjoy the one you buy."
3,"Samsung LNT4665F 46"" 1080p LCD HDTV","This product arrived in a timely manner and in perfect condition. Very good white glove delivery service. The HD quality of this set is excellent but the upconverted SD signals are not at all good. This may be a problem with all HD 16:9 sets, though I am not sure. If you do not have the majority of your favorite channels in HD, I would suggest nursing your old 4:3 set as long as you can. So far the SD is much better on the older sets. and for that matter, the HD content is not that much worse than on the HD set."
5,Samsung LCD TV.,The tv is great. Awesome picture and sound. Delivery from Amazon was professional and ahead of schedule.
4,compatible with sony`s home theater??,"i want to buy a Sony BRAVIA DAV-HDX267W Theater System with Wireless Speaker Kit, it,s compatible with this tv samsung?? i have read some opinions of problems with HDMI. what do you think??"
2,Please be advised,"For those of you have seen the rave review about this TV, please note that the TV has a glossy screen. This is unlike a traditional LCD. If you are looking for glare resistant system, this is not it."
2,Do I have a lemon ?,I got this in July....and it looked great out of the box. Since then the pix has started to develop rolling purple lines....the lines are getting worse...and they persist when the tv input is turned off. Maybe I just got a lemon.
4,Amazing picture,"Overall this is a great monitor and I am very pleased. There is some clouding visible on solid dark screens but I can't notice it during regular programming. I understand that this is a common issue for LCD monitors. This is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. I have various HD sources (PS3, XBOX 360, DIRECTV HD) connected and they all look fantastic."
1,HDMI PROBLEMS can NOT be resolved after 2 service visits,"LNT4665F intermittant video(goes black), have to turn TV OFF/ON for video to come back on. Then happens again, and again. Samsung says there is a software upgrade, Service has tried twice to upgrade software and failed twice. Samsung is VERY SLOW and appears not to be very willing to escalate this issue. Samsung makes it very hard to ESCALTE problem. NOT IMPRESSED WITH SAMSUNG CUSTOMER SERVIE or lack of concern for the customer! THINK TWICE BEFORE BUYING!NOTE: I have replaced the ""cable box"" two times, I have replaced the HDMIcable with two different MNFG. cables, SAME RESULTS. SAMSUNG ack.'s the HMDI PROBLEM, they just can not seem to fix my LNT4665F! buyer beware!"
1,"Nice TV, but has a design flaw that will cost you!","I bought my Samsung LN-T4665F about 1 1/2 years ago and it no longer is working. Just after it is out of warranty it started clicking and now, 3 months later, it doesn't work at all! This is happening to several models of Samsung TVs and Samsung is doing nothing to resolve the issue. In fact, there is a class action lawsuit about this ([...]). Please see the following sites before purchasing ANYTHING Samsung:[...]All I can say is BUYER BEWARE! SAMSUNG does not support their products well. The fix for this costs about $10 in parts, but is a $300 service repair to have a tech do it. IT'S NOT WORTH THE RISK!"
2,Not Sure!,"I received tv for a great price from Amazon and had no trouble with the shipping. TV picture quality was awesome, immediately loved the tv. Had tv for approximately a week and then on vacation for two weeks. Came back and watched off and on for another couple of weeks, then picture went real white. Called Amazon but it was past thirty day return policy. Called Samsung and got the run around for a week and a half about getting it repaired. The first place they told us to call to get it fixed the guy just laughed and said he didn't want to touch it. Finally , found a local repair shop and the guy there said he had never heard of a problem like the one we are experiencing. Been with out tv for going on three weeks. Not sure about quality or quality of service."
5,"VERY PLEASED, TOP NOTCH SELECTION HDTV","I couldn't be more happier for my second HDTV selection. This Samsung HDTV is what it suppose to be, clean picture, astonishing color image, beautiful piano black frame. Very easy to setup, I purchase this set from AMAZON.COM and it was deliver 4 days later great service AMAZON.COM I would buy any electronic item from AMAZON."
2,TV Time?,"The Samsung is a great TV and the price couldn't be beat. But the delivery was poor. It was promised to arrive on or before 12/18, but got stuck at the shippers location in Houstan. I needed to make several calls and Emails with Amazon (yes you can call with some one if you are persistent), their shipper and the shipper's subcontractor to get things moving. It was finally delivered to my door and unpacked in my livingroom at 8:30PM Sunday night 12/22. This part of the deliverly was great."
2,Has 3 year life max.,"TV was great until it started having trouble not turning on. Would power on then shut off instantly before the picture could even come on. This started out happening for 5-10mins before it would turn on for good. Now it doesn't come on at all anymore. In my opinion Samsung offers the best picture quality bar none. But they should be ashamed to produce a product with a 3yr life and not jump on the problem right away. From what I've read, this is a common problem. I have another (newer model) 55"" Samsung. Hope this doesn't have the same fate."
2,"won't turn on right away, makes clicking noise for about a minute first.","This problem was intermittent and less severe at first but is steadily getting worse. This is apparently a common problem with all Samsung tvs. I also had problems with Samsung phones in the past. I would not buy another Samsung product of any kind.______________p.s. Feb 2011 after some research I discovered this is a known defect due to a specific part; I called Samsung and they sent out a tech to replace the part, no charge. Anyone having similar issues, I'd suggest contacting Samsung. After the repair I'd rate this tv 4 out of 5."
2,Don't Waste your time...,"I purchased LNT4665F in late January and I am disappointed to report that after nearly 20 days of trouble shooting and calibrating the set I was unable to get a quality picture worth $2000. After many hours of research I found out that many of the main boards on these early 2008 builds were not compatible with he latest firmware nor the ealrier firmware available. To make things worse many of the panels on this set were defective. I ended up returning the set. If you can find a used set that was built in mid 2007, then I would go ahead and get that unit otherwise, just wait for the next series which will be out any day now (late august 2008)."
4,Comparable to 46A550,"Must say I loved this TV though it pixelated during jumpshots and quick motion. After reading reviews, I returned it for the Samsung LN46A550. The pixelation was still evident but not as much. The colors, clarity, and the remote are definitely better on the LN46A550. The location of S-Video inputs, sound, and overall cosmetics is much better on the 4665f. I probably would have been happy with either TV but stuck with the 46A550. The biggest difference between the two is the sound. The sound sucks on the 46A550 but was a non-issue for me since I have separate speakers."
5,Plasma-like without the Plasma,"Great picture...find the settings from the infamous 1499 post in AVS forums. It works great. I absolutely love the shine on the surface...it's the closest picture to Plasma (which I prefer). Also, you really need a Surround Sound System....The audio is OK for a TV. I have this hooked up to a PS3 and a Motorola HDTV cable box."
3,HD flat screens,"This TV is beautiful when watching HD channels. However, what no one told me before I bought the TV, was that all LCD flat screens are below average for non-HD channels. Actually, below average might be an understatement! I wish I had waited a year or two until the technology was better! Most of the local TV stations that I watch are not broadcast in HD yet."
3,samsung rev,Picture is not has great on the analog channnels as I thought when viewing it in a store. Currenrly have the t.v hooked up to straight cable. I am hoping a digital converter box will help.
5,Great TV,"When the TV was finally delivered (free shipping), it worked flawlessly. It switches between the different resolutions very quickly, so from TIVO HD main menu to 1080i is very quick. i use the VGA input from my XBOX HD DVD and that is fantastic. I've attached a laptop to the same input and its very clear. The contrast ratio completely overpowers any reflections that I see on screen before i turn on the TV.One silly thing; take off the plastic wrap, that covers the power buttons on the top right of the set. my plastic wrap was holding one of the buttons causing the display to show the firmware level. take off the protective plastic, and all is fine.Love this TV. Very nice TV. Very glad i got it."
2,Only lasts for 2 years! Don't buy it. Keep searching for reviews,"After only two years, it won't turn on immediately and purple and green grid covers the screen. Thought it was only MY tv but when searching online for troubleshooting, I found it is very consistent and Samsung is NOT taking responsibility. Loved it for the first two years, but that would be $1000 per year to watch TV. Not worth it. Keep shopping"
3,Mine is making the clicking sound now too for the last month or so,"I've loved this TV since I purchased it form Amazon in February, 2008. It started making the clicking sound in early Sept 2010. I just happened to click on this page today as I was clearing out my old Amazon ""Wish List"" and I'm shocked that all of these models have this problem.When you turn it on, it takes up a minute to actually turn on, and just makes this clicking sound over and over until it finally comes to life. From the other reviews it sounds like it doesn't have long left without intervention. I guess I need to call someone to replace the capacitors asap before the TV dies for good. I love this TV otherwise and I hope I can get it fixed."
2,samsung ln-t4665f no longer works,"Paid 2,300.00 for samsung ln-t4665f I had expect it to work longer than 2 years"
2,Short term quality,"We purchased this tv thru Amazon 2years ago. The delivery service and set up was excellent. The tv had a beautiful picture and good sound. We were completely satisfied - UNTIL NOW. There is sound but just a black screen. After searching the internet for a possible fix, we found this to be a common problem with this model. The Samsung service rep that called us was rude and short. We are in the same metro area as his shop but he was going to charge us a $35 out-of-town fee plus mileage. We are having difficulty finding someone else to work on this tv.From reading reviews on Amazon and searching other blogs it sounds as if Samsung is not the brand to go with, especially this model.Please be aware that we have received nothing but excellent service from Amazon."
5,brilliant,Had this for LCD about a year. Pisture better than the movies. Have it hooked up to HD Tivo and HD Cox cable. Keeps getting better as it ages. Samsung better than Sony??!@!!...Yup!
1,OK spending $2k for a one year television?...Then this one's for you!!,"Unfortunately this system will not let me give a rating less than one star. I was extermely please with the LNT-4665 when I received it, and for the next year thereafter. Unfortunately, it has been a nightmare ever since. The first issue (8/23/09); sound but no picture. Samsumg customer service contacted; repair center came to my home, replaced two circuit boards to no avail; took it to their shop; returned it claiming repaired, but they had created a new problem; sent to their shop again; claimed no problem at all; they brought it back with yet another problem. At this point I am trying to get the set replaced as it is apparent this one cannot be repaired, or the service techs are not smart enough to fix a tv. Samsung Customer Service is absolutely terrible and non-existent. It has been nearly a month and a half and still no results. SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED DOLLARS WITH ANYONE ELSE!!!"
3,Great picture. HDMI issues with all 2007 Samsungs.,"I have the forty inch version of this TV. Outstanding picture. These have the best black level of any LCD on the market IMO. However, Ive had my tv for a few weeks and have had several HDMI video dropouts and green flashes. The video even dropped out once and didn't come back until I did a power cycle on the tv. This is an HDMI handshaking issue which plagues the entire line of 2007 Samsung LCDs. There are also people who are experiencing uneven back lighting on video sources through HDMI. Which I've noticed, but can be adjusted to the point where its not bad. These are HDMI 1.3 sets, but 1.3 is supposed to be backwards compatible. So the reason for the drop outs is unknown. So just be aware of this if you do buy this tv. Who knows, maybe Samsung will release a firmware update to fix the issue. But they have to acknowledge the problem first.Stop by avsforum dot com to see what everyone is talking about in regards to the HDMI issues."
2,New Processor...not as good as old one,After months of research I finally decided to buy the Samsung 4665. When I hooked up the TV I was not blown away by the image I saw. The TV did not look much better than my old 480p TV. There was severe noise in the background and around the main images. After a week or two of debate I realized that I had to return the TV since I was not happy. I instead decided to spend some extra money and get the sony XBR4. This purchase was well worth it and it looks amazing...this also showed that it was not my cable source but the Samsung that looked not so good. I guess you get what you pay for since this was the cheaper TV.
4,Gr8 tv so far,I have only had this tv since Christmas but I am so happy with this picture. The colors r gr8 ad the picture is real clear'
2,Disappointed,This tv was nice when i first got it - now that the capacitor isn't working (started not working before the tv was two years old) i don't care for it.....will cost way too much to fix and samsung did not compensate - i am truly disappointed with this purchase.....
1,Better get the extended warranty,"This TV is awesome WHEN IT IS WORKING. About 20 months after I purchased it my set started making a clicking noise when I turned it on. No picture and no sound for several minutes and then it would finally come on. I googled the issue and found that this problem is quite common on many Samsung LCD televisions. Apparently Samsung has installed capacitors in the power supply which have a voltage rating much too low for the purpose they serve. Eventually these capacitors will start to fail (anywhere from 16 to 24 months depending on use). Luckily I found a gentleman who had the same problem and fixed his own TV, and fortunately for me I work for an electronics manufacturing company. A lady I work with replaced the 10 volt capacitors with 25 volt parts and the TV works great again. I will never buy another Samsung TV and I strongly recommend that anyone who does get an extended warranty...you will need it."
1,no picture after 16 months,"Still has audio but no picture. I expect a $2,000+ set to work for many years not just 16 months. The LCD has to be replaced for a parts cost of $1,800 and a service cost of $300. This amounts to the cost of a new TV set. The set is 4 months out of warrenty. I will not be purchasing another Samsung LCD set. Very disappointed in Samsung quality."
5,outstanding product,"After doing all the research and talking to friends, this TV became an easy choice for me. After a few weeks, I can say that I am thoroughly impressed by the performance and looks of the TV. The shipping was handled well, as I will admit I was a little nervous about. The box came without a scratch on it.One tip. The TV does not come with an HDMI cable and I did not have one when the TV was delivered so I ran out to a local store to buy one for 10x what you pay for the cable online. So buy the cable online and save some $$$ so that you are ready to go when the TV arrives because you will be thrilled with the picture."
5,Great Quality Picture,"I purchased this for the entertainment room, and it is awesome. The picture is great, and I have a computer with blue ray / hddvd hooked up to it via hdmi, and a philips soundbar, and all the components work great together.The picture quality is amazing, with the 15,000 to 1 contrast ratio. I am enjoying the television so far, and would highly recommend it."
1,Lasted just about 4 years,"This was a fantastic TV when it worked. I bought this in June 2007 and never had any major issues until about April 2011. It had the same issue reported by most others, pink dots and delayed start up. I got the three damaged capacitors replaced and the pink dots are gone and no more delayed start up issues. However, something worse happened, the image started flickering, shows double image at times and in a matter of few minutes the images is washed out with pink/blue color spread all over the screen. It is not even usable now!"
4,Looks like it is fine TV,"After going through multiple on line reviews of various products ( Panasonic plasmas, sony XBR , Samsungs ). I have finally decided to buy this over Sony XBR, becuse the XBR does not have PIP functionality. Also this was rated higher on CNET and was little cheaper.Since this is my first HDTV, I can really compare it to any thing. But HD channels on Dishnetwork are really crystall clear. The standard definition varies from excellent to fair. I am not sure, if this is based on the quality of the video or the transmition quality of the channel. I have the NBA classic, which was showing the 77 Portland Blazers championship series, the picture was really grainy. but CNN and other channels look fine. I also like the fact that the set is very ligh weight. A friend of mine said , this one is display SD sinals better than his LCD rear projection TV ( samsung ). But his is at least 2 years old.Hope this helps."
4,Solid TV,"The TV has great black levels and I just found it to be an overall good value when compared to the Sony. I was also considering the Sharp 92U but Amazon wasn't selling it at the time. Amazon had a great price compared to retail outlets and even compared to other electronics online stores, whom I've heard too many horror stories about. So I decided to go with it and with Amazon. The TV came much earlier than expected, the guys delivering it walked it up 3 flights of stairs and waited until I was satisfied with it before leaving. So, easy delivery with Amazon. The TV itself is crisp especially when I use the PS3 to play games or watch blu-ray movies. I don't notice any banding issues or clouding, but I don't really know what that would look like honestly. My purpose in buying it was for it to be my ""workhorse"" TV for the next 10 years, and it does fine in this respect."
3,pink and purple dots on the screen,I bought my LNT4665 in the fall of 2007. In January of 2011 I noticed Pink and purple dots appearing on the screen sometimes. When I would turn the TV off and back on again it would go away. The TV would also make clicking noises when I would turn it on. IT would cycle on and off a few times before it would stay on. I contacted samsung and they were not helffull at all. I'm sure they were just glad it was out of warranty. I did some troubleshooting and found that it had some bad 1000uf capacitors on the power board. The capacitors that were bad were 1000uf 10V rated. The should have been rated for at least 1000uf 25V. I changed all of them out and the TV works fine now. I don't think I will buy another samsung though. They treat their customers horrible. Hope this helps.
2,Not so great,"This shaver is ok but has an electronic problem. I get clean shave with little bit of effort but, My main problem is with ON/OFF button. Just after using this for 3-4 months my shaver ON/OFF button stopped working. It is always in ON position I can't switch off the razor. The only way it switches off is when the battery runs out."
2,Doesn't clean as expected,Razor works great but it's easier to open it and run water over it to clean because the cradle doesn't get all the hair out.
4,Norelco 7800XLCC Jet Clean System Men's Shaver,"I like the quietness of the shaver, the closeness of the shave, and the lightness of the razor. Also, I like the larger holding area for the whiskers. I don't like not being able to buy the solution locally, or even on the Norelco website. I don't know what I'll do when I run out of solution."
4,decent razor,"Contrary to the box description, this razor does not take ""Quadra"" blades.The 7800XLCC model will fit the Speed XL blades with no modifications as well as the Spectra HQ8 Heads. Great value. Mine says, ""Made In Holland"" but my old razor a 6826xl which was ""Made In China"" had much better build quality. This is really a hybrid razor: A Speed XL body with Spectra HQ8 blades.It still takes 8 hours to charge for 45 minutes of shaving, which can be frustrating."
1,Poor product,I was suprised by this razor. Firstly I was never able to get the self cleaning mechanism to work. Additionaly I was dissapointed that there was not a bar that would allow you to know how much charge remains in the razor. Finally I feel that after purchasing Norelco razors for several years this was the most inferior compaired to other Norelco purchases I have made.
3,Is this shaver new or refurbished,I want to know that this Norelco 7800XLCC Jet Clean System Men's Shaver of $49.99 on Amazon is new or refurbished or used.Hello
5,Great Product,Hey these were the best we've seen in some time. Much better than our local stores have in stock.Thanks
1,Highly unreliable,"Router works pretty well except for the fact that IT LOCKS UP AT LEAST ONCE A DAY. It'll drop all connections (wireless and wired) and refuse new ones until you reset it. Plus, mine refuses to upgrade the firmware and gives ""not enough resources"" errors. I have hardware v1.0 so MAYBE v3.0 is better, but why take the gamble?"
1,HMMMM.......................,"I think she looks better in the movie.I saw a picture of her in the story and she was just ok,but she is realy ugly.Her smile is not that normal.Barbie as princess Annika doll is more better than this one."
5,Very pretty!!,"My daughter loves Barbie dolls so much, so I decided to get this one for her....she loves it. I also like it very much, it is a break from all the skimpy clothed ones. The dress is very beautiful and we play with it everyday...."
5,I love it!,"This barbie is amazing! Her face is just perfect, and the outfit just like that gorgeous concert! I received the product at time too!"
3,Early Gems:,"A 20 song collection by Sablon, including 3 rare early sessions with the legendary guitaristDjango Reinhardt, with whom he had toured for many years."
1,Mediocre,"I got this set recently. Though on the picture the chisels look like those made in Germany (see set of 4 chisels, sold by Grizzly), these are made in China. They are ground very roughly, with noticeably rounded cutting edges. They are dip-covered with some laquer.You'll have to spend an hour (per each) with a diamond file, to flatten rounded edges and generally shape them. I have not tried them in work yet, have to polish and hone before that. Don't know if they are really made from chrome-vanadium steel as advertised.If your time is worth any money, you better get more expensive and higher quelity set.But at least, they look better than those (God forbid) Buck Bros carving chisels."
3,Good For Roughing Out,"This was one of the first sets I bought mainly due to the lower price. The factory bevels are far to steep and have to be reground. Carving with the factory bevels is like carving with a hammer. As far as the construction, like everybody else has said, they are cheaply made ""Flee Market"" tools from China but once they've been reground, sharpened and honed they make good tools for roughing out your work and save the edges of your good tools for the finer work."
3,you DO get what you pay for,"First of all, I am not expert in wood carving chisels. When I was 9 yrs old, 2D wood sculpting was my passion until I was 14 and had to leave communist Romania with my parents.Recently I purchased this set for a relative in Romania. Received the set VERY fast (2 days) but when I opened it to check it out, I saw that some of the chisels had rust marks on the sharp edges, the way the handles were made was not too professional or durable (medal rings being loose) and the whole design and feel and weight of each chisel seemed ""under par"" and mediocre.I did love the fact that my cousin will get 12 different designs and carving shapes, and also the kit comes with a very cool leather case that makes the 12 pieces very portable.All in all, great design set with great chiseling options but more geared for newbies or amateurs than professionals. After all, you do get what you pay for."
4,A Hell of a Film,"Last Exit to Brooklyn tells a story the way it needs to be told...realistically. This film is not for everyone. If you can't accept the fact that some people do behave like this than this film is not for you. Everyone doesn't live in a fantasy land and Last Exit to Brooklyn shows this. People brought up in conditions like these or who are familiar with people such as this can vouch that people are truly like this in some places. It may not be an excuse for how others act but it is real and this film proves that. This is a powerful, moving film not to be looked upon if you're easily offended out of your own ignorance and live in a rose-colored world. If you have the ability to watch a movie, understand it and be taken in with what the film represents ( without feeling threatened ) then this movie is a keeper. If you can't see that Last Exit to Brooklyn deplicts reality for people other than the super fortunate, rent Sweet Home Alabama because this movie is not for you."
3,twisted but quality,"The condition and quality of the product were excellent. However, the film itself is incredibly disturbing. Sad to think that there are people this messed up in our world."
1,Where's Mark?,"If you're familiar with Knopfler's movie soundtrack work you feel his presence in the layered ambience reflective of his solo commercial albums. Mark plays guitar somewhere on track five, but i guess I missed it. It's his music performed by a chamber orchestra, but you would never fathom he had anything to do with this. i love almost everything Mark Knopfler has done, from Dire Straits to his solo work, but pass on this. Finding him on this is like playing ""Where's Waldo?""."
5,greats,"i finerly got to own this movie on dvd, i had seen it at the movies when it came out,went back and saw it a couple of times,then it went and every time i asked about it no one had heard of it, then i was looking for dvds on amazon one night and there it was ,so i ordered it and watched it straight away the day it arrived,it is a very sad and graffic movie but has some great actors in it and is told very well,you cant take your eyes off the screen,i think this is a very true slice of life from that time,if you like a confronting story and not prettied up movie then i can recomend not to be missed."
5,Among the finest films ever produced,"Among the finest films ever produced, this film is not only cinematically brilliant, but far transcends Selby's original vision through Uli Edel's brilliant ability to weave together vignettes into an overall picture of a dark, continuous cycle of social struggles being resolved and re-emerging with new faces. The acting is brilliant as well. -Chris Coffman"
5,Hubs,"Arrived earlier than scheduled and fit perfectly, fixed thew problem i was having with the vehicle on which they were ordered"
5,love this item,shipped and received in a timely manner this item is premium and should only be purchased by premium ppl with premium hair. I like to write reviews and I love the constant barrage of emails Amazon sends for me to review products
2,Solid but awkward and useful for only limited aplications,"The clamp is well built but poorly designed. It is difficult if not near impossible to use when not laying flat. Also, without separate clamps for each piece to be joined, it is difficult to align corners that don't meet perfectly. With other 90 degree clamps that have dual clamping surfaces, you can clamp one piece of wood and guide in the second then tighten the clamp. This is impossible with the Grizzly clamp, you would need three arms to do it.On the up side, this is a large clamp and works very well when lying on a flat surface with the work piece well supported. I would still recommend almost any other clamp as long as it is the dual design."
1,"I have this same clamp from another brand name, but...","If you are into woodworking and making frames, don't expect this to put pressure on the two miter points of each leg. It will only hold them close together after you line up the miter and put your own pressure at the joint. Unfortunately, I have always found when tightening that the joint will slip slighty from side to side, and you have to continually try to realign it yourself. I have had this for probably 5 years and am about ready to throw it in the garbage; however, if you want something to hold a couple pieces of metal together while you weld the joint, it would be fine."
4,Finally a new album!,"I fell in love with her first album and was so excited to see she had a new one. While it wasn't an instant hit for me like the first one, I still really like it"
2,Too S-l-o-w!,"This release has been hailed in many quarters as ""magnificent,"" ""revelatory,"" and so forth, and I must say that when I listen to it, I certainly feel as though I am getting my six bucks' worth. As opulent and grand as everything sounds, however, I cannot quite help but think that this performance is just WAY TOO S--L--O--W!Tintner stretches the first movement out to 30:34, for crying out loud! When I put on my old Sinopoli disk (DG 431 684-2), it is like a breath of fresh air. Sinopoli takes the first movement in 21:08, but the music never sounds rushed. It sounds right.In my view then, the Tintner disk on Naxos might serve as an interesting alternative version that can be obtained quite cheaply, but it would not serve well as a first choice. I would recommend instead Inbal or Sinopoli, but the way the recording industry is heading these days, I'm not willing to guarantee that either of those disks is still in print. Oh well, there's always the library. Maybe there's a copy there."
4,"Some great, some less","This album is a collection of the earlier works of the magnificent Japanese rock group Mr Children. Especially tracks 4,6,7 and 11 stand out as being truly amazing, whilst the other songs admittedly have a certain attraction to them, although not as great. Overall this album offers a lot to fans of Mr CHildren, yet if you are a new fan, never yet having heard this band, i would advise a different album, perhaps Its A Wonderful World, Bolero, or Discovery. As a foreigner, i can honestly say that not understanding the lyrics only enhances the music and is of no importance, as the fusion of a wide range of instruments works majestically and is a great listen for everyone. Enjoy the album!"
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,"I purchase these regularly. When our grandkids come over, they know we'll have ""Krabby Patties"" in the pantry for them. I believe that everybody likes these! Try them and see for yourselves."
4,Nice!,"It's fairly difficult (At least in my area) to find the larger sized Krabby Patty gummies, these are pretty awesome!"
1,Beware: Squidward Made These...,"Several years ago, we got these patties at Halloween time. We tried them, only to discover that they had no taste at all and were incredibly chewy, so much so that you would have to be Andre the Giant (RIP) to masticate them. Anyway, we decided that they might be stale. Throughout the past years, we have always tried the patties when received at Halloween time, as Valentine's Day treats, etc., wondering how a cute concoction such as this can be so weirdly terrible. Yes, it is true- they are not stale, just inedible, which is a shame for a product that is supposed to indeed be edible. Your teeth and taste buds will thank you for not purchasing these patties."
2,YUCK!,This candy is gross. It feels and smells like you are eating playdough or some type of smushy toy that your child brought home from school after it was left sitting on the floor. Disgusting. I should have bought gummy worms instead. There's a reason why cartoon shows are best left being in shows than doing anything else.
2,This is not delicious at all...,"The size is decent, but not particularly delicious. I'm disappointed. I should have thought twice before buying a pack of 36 gummies."
1,Poor quality candy,"I am a dyslexia specialist who tutors children. I ordered this candy to use as a reward for my students. I was very disappointed in the poor quality of the candy. It was hard and seemed stale. It was so hard that my student could not bite it with his teeth, but had to use scissors! The taste was also poor. My fourth grade student spit it out! He has enjoyed gummy bears and gummy worms, but would not eat this. My seventh grade student ate one, with difficulty, and said they were really bad and not to bring any more.I thought perhaps it was stale, but the expiration date on the box said August 2012. So I concluded that this is just very poor quality. I threw the remainder in the trash."
1,disappointed about Krabby Patties,My grandchildren did not like these Krabby Patties at all. They said the small ones are good but these larger ones did not taste good.
1,Made in China,"Took it out of the box and saw that was made in China and initiated a return. I will not feed my children, or pets, any food products that are made in China."
2,LaTex content is way out of date,This book doesn't seem to have been updated since 1994. There has been a large number of packages released for LaTex since then which this book does not seem to reference.
3,This 1994 V1.4 Supports LaTeX and not current LaTeX2e,"I did not purchase this kindle release ebook because its content is so old; since I looked at the sample kindle book preview and what it presented about the publishing date. But, if your new to LaTeX2e typesetting; it follows, this books most-likley has some value for understanding how 'document markup language' works yesterday similar to as it still works today and LaTeX is updated each year."
3,Pulp........not quite another Get Carter!,Pulp is a reteaming of Michael Caine and Get Carter director Mike Hodges. Not much could follow the impact of their previous and wildly influential movie. Pulp is a rather uneasy blend of comedy and gangster action that would have been great if it had worked just a little better. However if you are a Michael Caine fan then it really is worth finding this rather obscure movie and the rewards are definitely there even if your appetite is just wetted for what might have been.
5,Got here amazingly fast! And great product!,This product arrived fully assembled and extremely quick. The product is great quality so far and matches my Rampage bowless softtop perfectly.(diamond) The noise reduction from the plastic zipper windows is huge and no air leaks.
3,UPGRADING FROM ZIPPERS,"lot better than plastic zip windows on DRY DAYS.fit well,look great,slide well,nice tint,great shipping,excellent customer service on shipping replacements. BUT they leak when it rains.first one heavily, second one steady.will try another.when checking reviews i did'nt realize people had made you tube videos about their bestop sliders leaking. lot of money to have this problem on so many.I've used them for 1 month"
2,Windows Leak,"Was looking for an alternative to my zipper windows. The door sliders looked great, but they leaked around the window frame into the jeep. This was just mild rain, not a heavy rain. I had seen a similar comment from another pruchaser on line, but thought I'd give it a shot. Did quiet the ride. Returned for refund.Would not recomment to a friend."
3,Almost perfect,"I have a 2000 jeep wrangler with half doors and thought this item would be a cost effective solution to buying full doors, which can be quite expensive. The install is as simple as in can get, it goes on the exact same way the factory zip up windows go on. I love them so much more than the zip up windows.....until it starts to rain! The slider windows like to leak. I live in michigan where the rain is not super bad, but it is enough where it can be an annoyance. I would certainly buy these windows again; just make sure to have a towel handy if it starts to rain!!"
5,Outstanding!,"I just received these and am delighted with the quality and fit. They actually make the ride quieter. Two things to keep in mind - There are two different choices for the black color (black denim and black diamond). I was all set to order the black denim and then decided to call the manufacturer. They informed me that the factory top for a 2005 Wrangler was black diamond. If you're not certain what yours is, call Bestop customer service to determine which you need. Second, the vehicle fit tool here on Amazon says that these don't fit my vehicle. It's wrong."
5,Don't miss it,"This performance is absolutely fantastic.The pieces are short, but full of content and maybe Mompou is the more underated composer of the last centuryThe playing of Jordi Masó is excellent.A must have."
3,Be Warned,"The heart of this software is the 1962 Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible. It is hard to find this separate from the larger set of IB Commentary. Also the introductions of the NIB commentary here. Liberal, but interesting. Be Warned that it will not load to your hard drive. It is locked by ""Nextpage"" to look to the CD Rom or nothing. Copying it to the hard drive and setting it up there does not get around this feature. Abingdon wants to protect their ""intellectual"" property, as they put it. That is ok, but it should be plainly stated in their advertisements. Of course, it is not for it would hurt sales and marketing knows that. What if all Biblical software could not be off loaded to the hard drive? It is my understanding this is true for all their software, so why someone would spend $500+ for the New Interpreter's Commentary and not to be able to load it on hard drive is beyond me."
1,Presents a decidedly liberal theological perspective,"The Bible commentaries are written from a liberal theological perspective. It is obvious that the authors believe the Bible is just a product of ancient myths and storytelling. They disbelieve miracles and explain away prophecy by assigning late dates to the books. The notes put forth theories that are based upon opinion and conjecture rather than solid textual evidence. More a work of anti-Christian and anti-Jewish propaganda than a balanced, scholarly work. Also, while it is not a bad translation, the NRSV does have some gender-neutrality inserted into it. All in all, I cannot recommend this study Bible. It reads like skeptics and non-believers wrote it. Instead, I would recommend the NIV Study Bible or NKJV Study Bible."
2,Liberal's Study Bible,"This is a liberal's study bible. The study notes show the best 'modern' scholarship, which doubts Moses wrote the first 5 books of the bible. Doubts the authorship of most of Paul's Epistles. Even doubts that the beloved disciple John wrote the Gospel of John.Believes Redactionary Interpretive Theory is valid. Falls right in line with most modern and so called 'higher' critisim of the Bible. Avoid this study bible, if you believe the Bible is really God's word from cover to cover."
1,What is Happening to the Truth?,"I was greatly disappointed in this book, should have read all of the reviews instead of just a few, it is not for a true Spirit filled Christ follower. The commentaries are not Biblical, but what I would call radical! I can't believe that pastors recommend this type of reading for their flock. Be advised.Marysmith"
4,Best Study Bible,"The New Interpreter's Study Bible: New Revised Standard Version With the ApocryphaAs a retired pastor, I still deeply enjoy the search of scripture and learning even more as I study the passages. This Study Bible is by far the best one I've ever used. Especially, I find very useful the many ""Excursi"" scattered throughout the edition."
3,the good and the bad....,"love everything about this study bible EXCEPT that the names of the books are printed in the middle of the page, not on the corners....makes it really hard to just page through to what you're looking for..... a BIG minus!!"
2,Moderate or Politically Correct?,"The NISB may be ""moderate"" in a theological sense by, for example, being willing to consider that Paul wrote Ephesians rather than it being the pseudepigraphal work of a disciple. But it definitely has a politically correct agenda stated front and center in the Introduction: to apologize for the perceived historical anti-Semitism of the Christian church. This theme drives an overwhelming number of the characteristic ""excurses"" in the NISB, pointing out where the Church Fathers proposed an anti-Semitic interpretation or guarding the reader against a common anti-Semitic reading of the text. It goes without saying that the NISB scholars' perceptions of anti-Semitism are often quite tendentious. One also has to wonder whether this sort of thing is what is most important for the reader to know. You may have thought the greatest heresy in Church history was Arianism - for the folks writing the notes to the NISB, it's supersecessionism."
4,The New Interpreters Study Bible,"The New Interpreter's Study Bible: New Revised Standard Version With the ApocryphaThis bible was recommended for a bible class I am taking, it is very easy to study from.For my own personal contemplation I prefer my King James Bible."
4,Study bible,"Great condition, almost like new!! took a little long to ship but was worth the wait overall satisfied with purchase"
4,Great content; so-so materials quality,"This is my favorite study Bible -- good insights on the historical background and sources.I would give it five stars if only they had used a little thicker or more opaque paper. The ""ghosting"" of the print on the other side of the page and the next page is very annoying and hard on the eyes. I almost sent this back without reading it for that reason. I'm glad now that I didn't, because I like it much better than the previous Bible I was using; but I still find the eye strain annoying."
5,Great Translation and Resource,Very close to the original Greek (and I assume Hebrew although I haven't translated that). Footnotes and mini-essays are extremely helpful
5,Great Current Intelligent Study Bible,We are using this text in our Kerygma Bible study group and it is very insightful and easy to use !
3,Study Bible Review,This Bible is a good place to start Biblical Studies. It is not however a reference work. There is no index. No copies of lost or obscure books; or references to the Dead Sea Scrolls.
4,Good Product,The New Interpreter's Study Bible came almost exactly the way that the seller said it would come and it came at a great price. The book is great and very helpful in my Biblical Literature and History Class. Thank you very much!
5,Bible Study,the Bible is just what it says it ismy only problem is although i knew beforehnd that it would be soft cover i still expected something a little sturdier. but honesly it is all that its supposed to bethankyou
2,"Bought two, but kept only one, because it had pages missing, so I returned it.","We were in a Bible study, and was told to turn to a certain section, but my Bible was missing that section, it had several pages missing. I can't remember, but I think it was pages 169-220.So, I went page by page in the other Bible, which was quite time-consuming, to make sure it was a complete Bible. We kept that one and returned the other one with the missing pages.The one we kept is okay. The print could be better.Having read some of this Study Bible - I think the comments are questionable.My other Bibles (for example, NIV and NASB) are better than NRSV."
4,NISB for serious study.,Serious Bible for those who are ready to move beyond the basics. A little deep for beginners.
3,"good wrap, lousy sizing","The product itself is good and usable, but I would strongly suggest ordering a size up from what you wanted to order."
3,"It's PINK, not RED!","I bought this because my kitchen is full of red accessories and thought it would fit nicely. I took it out of the package and my daughter said, ""Awesome! You bought a pink coffee maker!"" Just so you know:)"
2,Not worth your money and time,"Should have returned it upon receipt,not red! Some kind of raspberry or something. Quit working after 17 months. Ordered Curzart grinder coffee maker. Hopefully will last a few years."
2,"It's maroon, not red","I bought this for my mom who is redecorating her kitchen in red. Unfortunately, I did not open the box to check that the coffee maker was, in fact, red as stated in the description. I did not find this out until we were setting it up and it did not match any other red appliance in her kitchen. AND, since I bought it a month in advance, the return window had expired. Now I am stuck with a maroon (not red, as described) coffee maker."
4,nice coffee maker,"a nice coffee maker for the money. the on off switch is a little small,overall a good product. nice color"
2,Unit is NOT red,"Online image is red. Picture on box when you receive it is red. Coffee maker is burgandy. There's a big difference in the two colors. When purchasing a product for a specific color, it should be as shown. Since this was a color based purchase, I am extremely unsatisfied with the product. It is not as described."
1,Review of Mr. Coffee TFX26 12 Cup Coffeemaker,"Not only is this coffee maker of poor quality, it is downright dangerous. After three months of use, the switch has started failing intermittently. Sometimes it won't turn on and other times it won't turn off. It is frustrating when it won't switch on but it could potentially become a fire hazard if the water reservoir is empty and the off button is pushed but the consumer fails to notice it has not shut off."
2,Not red and messy!,"As others have stated, this is not red. Closer to burgandy or purple. Also the coffeemaker drips after the pot is removed. When the pot is full, you can not pour coffee without making a mess. Simple to use and makes a good tasting cup of coffee but the bad really out weighs the good."
2,low quality product,Very disappointed in the quality of this coffee maker - it's all plastic and feels very cheap.
1,Mr Coffee,I am not satisfied at all i received a purple coffee pot and I ordered a red one. I have sent 2 emails asking how I can return the pot but I haven't received a reply.Jim Copley
1,Meh...,"Ok, this coffee maker is not the one I own, but it's pretty similar it is the same only black. This thing does not make coffee properly. I measure out the ""8 cups"" of water, fill the basket, turn it on, and it makes ""6 cups."" It takes forever and a day to brew, and I often jump the gun and fill my cup while it's still brewing, which causes it to splash, which makes a mess. I have no patience for a Coffeemaker which does not brew coffee. Call me crazy, but that seems to be it's sole function. I don't know what the problem is, but it seems to me that twenty minutes to half hour is far too long for coffee to brew, and then be short changed by the results. Bad coffee maker! How can you torment me like this when i haven't had a cup of coffee yet...?"
3,Mr. Coffee 12C drip coffee maker,"Basic unit with not many extra features, but makes good coffee, looks good, and is quite easy to set up and use. That's what I wanted & that's what this unit delivers. Only ""complaint"" is that the top lid feels a bit flimsy and might be a bit too easy to break if you got rough with it. NOTE: After I bought this unit from Amazon, I found it for sale in a regular store for $23 and some change. That didn't make me very happy. Do yourself a favor and shop around."
1,"NOT RED! If you want RED, don't buy this!","I was so excited to find a RED coffee pot by my favorite manufacturer, Mr. Coffee! I got my ""RED"" coffee maker today, and it is NOT red! It is a DARK Burgundy color and is FAR from what I expected, and FAR from what is photographed. I am disappointed in Amazon for even calling this RED. I am returning this tomorrow, SADLY!!!! Just wanted to warn anyone looking for a RED coffee maker!"
1,you have to have supersonic hearing abilities,"to understand the person you're speaking with. I am glad it was cheap, because it's going in the trash!"
1,If I could give it zero stars I would,A picture of this phone should be in the dictionary next to the word garbage. It worked for 2 days. After that it just cut off after a few minutes and before cut off alot of static.
1,Garbage,"I bought this phone and it never worked from day one. We were in the middle of moving so I never took it back. When I called Uniden for guidance, the wait time to speak to someone was over 35 minutes so I e-mailed them through their website....never to receive any response."
4,"Nice Phone, great price.","I ordered two. I don't get why this series of phones gets marginal reviews. We have the all of the phones in our home switched over to these Uniden 2.4mhz models because of reliability, sound quality and price. At this price, when the batteries die and the buttons start to stick in several years (which almost all eventually do), toss them out. We have bought plenty of bad phones in the past, but with this line we have had no static or premature phone death. The search feature button on the base is nice when it gets buried in the couch. I strongly recommend them. Only reason I didn't give it a 5/5 is it wasn't free..."
4,great phone for a great price,I've owned this phone for about 2 1/2 years and so far it hasn't failed me once. I really do like it but the only thing I would to have loved it to have is a speakerphone. I'm still satisfied...... great price for a cordless.
2,"Nice, but...","... the beautiful finish, significant heft, and quality feel is, unfortunately, completely cancelled out by the disappointing build: Once the mounting plate portions are made level to each other, the swinging ""arm"" part of the latch -- even when fully seated at its resting point -- angles upward quite drastically and noticeably. To make the matter worse, the oval knob that's attached to the arm also ends up at a cock-eyed angle since it's square to the arm and goes along for the bad ride. The only undetectable way I can see fixing this is by grinding down the portion of the latch where the arm rests; that would have meant a LOT of filing and grinding. Too bad."
3,Very uneven quality of reproductions,"Richard Estes' photorealist paintings deserve a better book than this and thankfully they are out there. This publication is poorly and obviously cheaply reproduced with out of focus images, grossly inaccurate color, and even one image where the negative is ""flipped"" so the painting is printed backwards. That is simply shoddy proofing of the manuscript before final printing. Estes is a wonderful artist and his vision suffers with this documentation of his work."
5,Well-illustrated book on a great artist,"Large format book, containing many new images not shown in previous books on Estes. Colour reproductions are generally very good, interesting biographical and supporting text. May not be perfect, but very good. If you are a fan of Richard Estes or photorealism, you've got to buy one - I doubt you will be disappointed."
2,disappointing,I got this as a gift for a friend. I had seen one before and assumed this one would be similar.I liked the cover but the categories were strange and not easy to find the first three things that came up.I was disappointed and wish I could remember the exact examples because they seemed to be good things like flying.There was literally nothing close;(
3,Not for serious dreamers. :),"I got this book for Christmas along with a Dream Interpreter CD. This book basically has listing of many dream symbols as well as 'actions' such as 'if you lit a match..'. The reason I rated this book a three is that it's been somewhat helpful. A lot of symbols I wanted to know, I could not find them in the book and found them online instead. Searching for a dream symbol is a pain since the alphabetized symbols are all smashed together. Each symbol is CAPITALIZED but you also have many bolded words in there that makes it all a big mess when trying to find symbols. However, I believe this book is for more casual dreamers who just want to know a few things. If you're a serious dreamer who want it all, this book is not for you."
4,Pretty good.,"This dream dictionary is pretty good. It has most general dreams in it, but of course some dreams are not in there. When you can find your dream, however, it is very helpful and quite interesting. However when you cannot it is frustrating and annoying. Overall it's a good thing to keep by your bed for when you wake up, but don't expect it to have everything."
3,You get what you pay for,"This relaxer is OK. It does the job if you use enough of it. However, it will not last for very long and it will dry out your hair a LOT.You might wanna invest in professional hair styling if you want straighter hair without breakage."
4,A Great Pop Album,"Wow... while listening to this I hear flashes of Beatles, early Pink Floyd, and newer stuff like Bends-era Radiohead, Matthew Sweet, and even a splash of Flaming Lips. Very enjoyable from start to finish. There is a good mix of upbeat, mid-paced, and slow songs. Wonderful intrumentation with trumpets, celesta, piano and glockenspiel. The interludes with sound effects help tie the whole story together. While this is a concept album about post WWII...it is not nearly as depressing as Pink Floyd's The Final Cut."
5,GOOD STUFF,"Wow, I didn't expect anything this good. www.onetimesone.com has a great review of this cd, check it out, it says everything I would like to say but more eloquent."
3,Instrumentally diverse with sound,"Freshly released on Bardic records, ""After the War"" is a Rock & Roll album that has definite Indy influences. The make use of fuzz tone acoustic guitars, and distorted tinny vocals that drive through the entire album. There is a strained effort as the lead singer screams of past loves between trumpet lines, creating the false illusion of regality. The band has two line ups on the album and consists of Daniel Goodwin on percussion, Ryan Ball on bass and synthesizer, Jason Debiak on mellotron, Brad Paxton on guitars, Sarah Shephard on vocals, David Debiak on Vocals, guitar, and Vahak Janbazian on percussion. No website was listed for the band, though a Google search may turn something up. Look for the official release in early May. All content copyright www.maximumink.com"
5,Great religious movies,"This volume includes movies religious in nature.There are no featurettes or newsclips in this set.The Agony and the Ecstasy is the biographical story of Michelangelo.This 1965 movie stars Charlton Heston and Rex Harrison.This is color, 138 minutes and in letterbox.The Bible: In the Beginning... is about the first part of Genesis.This 1966 star studded movie was directed by John Huston.This is color, 172 minutes and in letterbox.Demetrius and the Gladiators is the sequel to The Robe.This 1954 movie stars Victor Mature and Susan Hayward.This is color, 102 minutes and in letterbox.The Robe is about the Roman who wins Christ's robe.This 1953 movie stars Richard Burton and Jean Simmons.This is color, 133 minutes and in letterbox."
5,classic bible movies,I will always recommended to all the people out there ho likes to wach movies from the bible stories this one is one of the best one's i ever see.thank you!
3,classic quad set 4,I was very disspapointed with this because when i ordered the set it stated that it was widescreen and pan and scan but it is only widescreen and also the set is all the old dvd made before some were restored.
2,everyone evolves/but not everyone improves,"I have been listening to Ms.Ciani for years now and I have come to the conclusion that the older material was more predictable and enjoyable.As time has gone by the music has drifted from relaxing piano instrumentals to CD's where certain songs are repeated on more than one CD to where the concept of ""relaxing piano instrumentals"" is abandoned for something else that just dosen't seem to work.If Ms. Ciani's older compositions were to be rated a 10,then Silver Ship is a 6."
1,Well worth the wait,I have listened over and over and never get tired of listening. Hope Susan doesnt wait another 5 years
2,"Too much talk, not enough soccer","The DVD has some great points in discussing the 3-5-2 system of play, but only a few. Mostly it's a closeup of a Brazilian coach(?) speaking in dubbed English, which is ok, except he doesn't really say much. The rest of it was some primitive animation to show the few points being made about the topic. It was a case of using the word ""Brazil"" to make a sale. And it certainly worked for me. It won't work again."
3,decent introduction,"I liked the DVD. I think if you have never played an instrument before it might be really hard to pick up from this. But ive played guitar for 15 years so that made a huge difference. Its good, broken down well and has a nice range of tunes from reels to jigs to standards,etc. Not much of a chance to jam yourself and solo and thats a bit of a bummer. But overall defintely worth the purchase."
3,Too much distraction!,"This DVD was OK with the exception the instructor has a buddie playing an accordian along with the songs. I found it distracting and it's hard to hear the Octave Mandolin playing. His tuning is not GDAE like a customary mandolin tuning, so the chording is different from standard mandolin chords. I've been playing a standard mandolin and guitar for years so the transition was not difficult. I didn't fully utilize the instruction because I want to go from a traditional mando to the octave in a set without the confusing tuning and different chords."
2,Still looking,"Limitations of this disc may reflect my limitations as a pupil.It seems to be intended for someone further along in their musicaldevelopment, particularly with fretted instruments. Comingfrom a fiddle background, I remain frustrated and clueless aboutchords. Zan appears bored, distracted, even vaguely annoyed.Pretty much the opposite of inspiring. I'll be selling this disc on eBay."

1,Who knows,"I have no idea as the book never came..it was a second hand book and somewhere in the process I got forgotten. NOt much of a money issue, but I wont ever order a 2nd hand book from Amazon again. BG"
2,the first music,"An impossible challenge it is to read and interpret the musical rythm of the Early times. Rudimentary instruments out of toone or short in strings give way to the symphonicals we listen to today. The simplistic taste of farm folk at the time of the Crusadfes and before, delightfully depicts those romantic times. This CD will transport you to a time long gone by yet very much present. Take yourself to the quiet open fields, the river banks and brooks; seat yourself under a tree with a nice booy and listen to this marvelous CD."
1,Not exactly Hogs!,"As a huge fan of McPhee's Groundhogs I took a chance on this one. Don't buy it if you want Hogs sound. By two sides, Tony is talking his blues side, and his progressive synth side. The instrumental 'Take it Out' is the highlight of the 5 blues songs. The rest of it is 19 minute epic 'the hunt'. Much of it is spoken. All of it is synth music from one of the greatest quitarists ever. His synth music does not at all match his guitar ability. It appears most people that like 'the hunt' are into its deep lyrics. I'm more into a good tune and great guitar playing. This is neither. Curiosity and love of a lot of the Groundhogs material made me buy this one. Wish I hadn't honestly. Jerry."
3,Old School British Blues,"As a 17 year old a friend got the original vinyl shortly after it was released. It got a hammering at parties for the next couple of years. At the time (in Australia) I don't think we actually knew what we were listening to, or the history that had clearly inspired these british players. It's rough and ready, and a take on the theme, but a part of british music history - just not as well aired or classy as Clapton and Mayall."
2,"Very uneven, slow paced start of the series.","""The Invaders Plan"" is the first of ten books in Hubbard's ""Mission Earth"" series. The books were not written separately, but as one long novel and divided into ten parts for publishing. And it shows. The plot moves very slowly, and the entire book is just really a very long buildup. They don't leave for Earth until on the very last page, so don't expect there to be any space adventures of invasion of Earth. I guess that will be in the sequels.The book does have its good parts, and occasional humor, but the pace is very uneven. At times, there are several pages of descriptions of details that are completely irrelevant.If you're just looking for a science fiction novel, look elsewhere. The book does not work well on its own. You must be prepared to read the whole series. If it will be worthwhile reading all ~4000 pages, I don't know yet."
2,"Enjoy, because it only gets worse!","I got a copy of Battlefield Earth while in junior high school, and loved it! I re-read it every few years, and still enjoy it as much as the first time. Well, imagine my excitement at the prospect of a 10 book series by the same author! I bought the book as soon as it hit the shelves and started reading, what a disappointment. I got done and wondered where the story was. I forced myself to read several of the following books, but the magic of Battlefield Earth was not repeated. The first book is a passable read, but I would recommend spending your money on something else."
2,Disappointing...,"I got sucked into the Mission Earth series after reading the spectacular ""Battlefield Earth"" (the best pulp scifi novel ever). Unfortunately, after buying in hardback all 10 of these bloated episodes, hoping that they would lead to a great ending, I was sorely disappointed.While the stories do have some of Hubbard's humor and some interesting satire, they don't have the cohesion, pacing or the characters of Battlefield Earth. It's not worth your time."
3,Well-Written,"Back to the review, extremely well-written. Hubbard's 'Invaders' never struggles for its next scene or plot. It flows smoothly throughout the entire novel. The protagonist, Soltan Gris, is a despicable person struggling to cope with the unpredictable circumstances he's thrown into.The book does grow weary at times. Gris gets into trouble and more trouble and more trouble, and always escapes. At points I found myself saying, 'Get on with it already!'.I'm totally unfamiliar with Scientology, so I can't judge whether the book is an attempt to brainwash readers. Hubbard does include some comments on the foolish humans destroying their planet. If that's scientology I can see why it appeals to Hollywood airheads.No explicit sex. All profanity is replaced with a (bleep) so it's easy enough to skip over."
1,One of the Worst books I've ever read,"I've read tons of sci-fi and fantasy throughout my life and this ranks in the bottom five of all books I've read of any genre. It's not funny. It's not interesting. What it is, is disgusting and mind numbingly boring. Please don't read this series. You'll be a worse person when you're done if you do."
2,don't waste your time,"If you've read battlefield earth and are eager for more, don't waste your time with this book. Read Dune or Forever war instead, those are the only ones that could get closer to that.Battlefield Earth was the best book I've ever read and I was expecting a lot from this one. But found a poor story, weak plot and irrational situations and explanations.People is saying that the first one is the better, I can't imagine how bad the others are ..."
3,Some fun,"I was hoping this would be as good as ""Battlefield Earth"" but the writing style is quite different, not quite at the same level? Still enjoyed it. Fun, for G-rated sci-fi."
2,bland,"Although the writing is alright, the story kinda drug along.After reading battlefield earth i expected more from this book.Wont get another in the series."
1,Disapointment after Battlefield,"After reading Battlefield Earth years ago, I could hardly wait when it was announced that Hubbard was coming out with a ten book Sci-Fi series. As soon as this did appear I purchased the first two books and was excited to finally be able to read more from this author. It did not take long to realize, however, that this was not of the same caliber as Battlefield. I struggled through the first book, gave the second a chance just to see if things would improve, and was so bored by the end of the second book, I vowed never to waste my time on anything else by Hubbard.Battlefield Earth was fantastic. Mission Earth is a lame duck. Hard to believe they are by the same author."
5,I laughed until I cried,"Having really enjoyed Hubbard's previous book, Battlefield Earth, I just had to give this new book (and series) a try. Wow, were they ever different. Aside from the fact that the entire story is told from a first-person POV, the satire and dark humour that pervades this book borders on genius. I found myself giggling and laughing out loud at numerous points and reading with my mouth cocked in a half-grin the rest of the time. I hadn't read much satire before this series and I am so glad I read this book. It is simply one of the funniest books I have ever read, but not in an obvious, over-the-top sort of way.Now, the series on the other hand, was a major disappointment. It's like, I liked books 1, 3, 5, 6, but hated the rest. Vry strange how the quality of the tale can vary so much from book to book. And yes, after book 7 the story does go downhill due to the authour's untilmely death. Ah well, I had already laughed enough to suit me by that point."
2,Pass it by,"I bought this series in hardback when it came out. And the only reason I have them all is that I hate an incomplete series on my shelves.This series, while very well written is nigh on unbearable. Each book has its moments that barely gives the reader a reason to continue.There are so many other books out there worthy of your time, don't waste it on this series.Try Jack L. Chalker's 'Well of Souls' for one."
1,"This isn't just Sci Fi, It is a piece of Literature !","That is arguably the best piece of fiction ever written. I was riveted for all 1.2 million words of the 10 piece set.In fact, I thought this work was so great that I had every copy signed by both John Travolta and L Ron himself.It's too bad that great writers like Shakespeare, Sun Tsu, Tolkein and Mark Twain have passed away--think of the things they would have learned from this epic piece. They would spend endless hours trying to imitate the art contained in these ten tomes of human achievement.Think about it, Hubbard's writing is so powerful that he created a zombie cult on a bet (Scientology), of which myself and John Travolta are members!And this work is no different. If you could stand reading beyond the first few books, you either already are a zombie or you are well on your way to being one."
1,Mission Earth,"The plot of the story revolves around a galactic empire preparing to invade earth. The Plot of this book would have been funnier if the invaders had distributed this story on earth in order to cause the population of Earth to become comatose so they could more easily subdue them. The story has a few minor problems such as bad character advancement, Poor plot line and a story that is not compelling. I would not recommend the book."
1,Caca.,"I read the first four books before I was bored todeath. Hubbard's writing style is very pedestrian, and I cannotbelieve that all the 5-star reviews in here did not come from other than Scientologists. This dekalogy is not worth a dime. Characters are flat, there is no movement, and what's Hubbard's problem with mental health professionals?"
1,Retch,"This may not be the worst book I ever read, but it will certainly be on the short list of such. Science Fiction! Give me a break! This book compares to Sci/Fi the way ""Green Acres"" compares to the U.S. Farm Report. After reading the introduction, I was expecting to be treated to some biting satire wrapped in a good Sci/Fi story. Instead, I got a plodding story line that went nowhere for 500+ pages, and satire that reads as though it were written by a third grader. Avoid this book at all costs!"
1,Could Have Been Good,"I've read the first and part of the second book of the 'Mission Earth' series and I don't think I will be able to finish it. It started out hopefully but then turned into a mess of slapstick satire. The style of writing is atrocious and much of the two books I've read so far could have been cut out. The story could have been very good and writing from the viewpoint of the villian is a stroke of genius, but this series just doesn't have what it takes to keep me interested in reading all the books."
3,"Interesting, deservant of another try!","Though stated in other reviews as terrible I found the first book to be interesting and comical. The way the main character bumbles around, and how the scientific knowledge know by Hubbard is astounding. Deffently worth the chance to read the next book."
1,I Can't Believe I Read the Whole Thing!,"Yep, I read all 10 books. It had to get better, right? RIGHT? Ugh, it didn't. Read Battlefield Earth instead, same author, much better."
5,A right rivetting read,"If you are interested in this fab piece of fiction, you can come to theapparatus.proboards25.com and join in the discussions!"
4,Worthwhile,"These men spoke from experience, so they were more than credible. The student audience asked some great questions, and there were some very salient answers."
3,Not as big as expected,"I was surprised to see such a little book. However, I never got to read it because my teenager picked it up, started laughing at what he read, and has been sharing it with friends ever since. It must be good."
4,"Drago shows talent in sexy thriller ""Mirror""","Fans of Billy Drago (Secret Games) often see him portray the deadly, subtle, psyhcotic menace who dies in spectacular ways. ""Mirror, Mirror III"" permits a display of the man's talent not often given a chance. Having the lead role, Mr. Drago portrays a regular guy but still exhibits the cool demeanor that he is noted for. His eyes are still hypnotic but not threatening. Though not a big buget movie, it's engaging. It's sexual and supernatural content pulls the viewer into a world of memories and fantasy. If you are a fan looking for a movie that gives Mr.Drago some air time and acting room, this is a good one. Or if you enjoy sexy thrillers, this one is perfect to introduce you into the genre."
3,Esta bien.,"Esta bien,No es terrorifica, es mas erotica.Aunque esperaba una pelicula menos predicible, esta bien para pasar un domingo en casa."
4,"Drago shows another side in sexy ""Mirror""","Fans of Billy Drago (The Untouchables, Delta Force II) often see him portray a sensual, subtle, psyhcotic menace who dies in spectacular ways. ""Mirror, Mirror III"" provides viewers the opportunity to see Mr. Drago's acting abilities that are not often given a chance. This lead role let's Mr. Drago be a regular guy but still display the cool demeanor he's noted for. In this sexy thriller, a sensual artist gets caught up in sex and witchcraft. And there's hell to pay. If you are a fan looking for a visually-sexy movie that gives Mr. Drago some screen time and acting room, this is a good one."
1,Waste of money!,Very elementary book and writing style. The author puts himself forward as an experienced Fed Watcher but his ideas and theories seem naive and elementary. You can learn more about the Fed by surfing the Fed's website. Author keeps repeating himself like he is senile or something!??? The author does not offer any insight one could not glean from reading Business week or the Wall Street Journal regularly.Don't waste your money on this!
3,Good product but look for alternatives,Converted to manual hubs. The nut conversion kit I later found out you can get from jeep as their stock nuts for about $20.Shipped fast.
5,who knows the name or title of the rock song in this movie?????????????????/,"as far as film theme is concerned it is not my thing, it is gross, perverted, twisted, downright obscene, unhealthy to watch, it depressed me, the only part of the entire film that interested me is a scene where a record is played on a phonograph and a really cute clothed blonde girl starts dancing to this incredible tune, this song is the most infectious rock groove I have ever heard AND FOR YEARS I have tried to trace down the artist, title, lyrics, anything really but have had no luck, anybody know the tune? The artist? Album title? Sounds French, probably recorded between 68-71, I give the movie 5 stars just for this, the rest of it was really sick."
5,More Boundweave info than you thought existed,"This is a large book that is a weavers course in boundweave. The introduction with it's definitions, drafts and excellent diagrams makes sure you know exactly what this weave is all about before starting you on the samples to weave. The author starts with plain weave, 7 different twills, 40 or so pages on rosepath then overshot. You could actually stop there and weave for years. But that isn't even half of the book. There's taquete' & sanitum & more. Terrific! Donna"
2,Not what I was looking for.,A very technical work on weft-faced pattern weaves that wasn't what I was looking for. This book is a college text for teaching way more weaving 'theory' than I wanted to wade through. I was looking for a book which would give patterns and directions in a more concise and understandable way.
