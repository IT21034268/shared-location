1,Like spinach and kids,"While the bluebirds did not hang around this spring, I do have quite a few Baltimore Orioles. The orioles love 2 things- live mealworms and grape jelly. When feeding live mealworms the orioles would eat as many as 12-19 worms per visit. Most likely feeding the new hatchlings. The large, fresh mealworms can cost as much as 10 cents a piece at our local Wildbirds Unlimited. Or I would purchase the smaller size live mealworms at $2.75 per 100.In any case the local feed store recommended trying dried mealworms. Whether I feed them dried or rehydrated, the orioles won't have anything to do with them. They will spit them out of the feeder as they search for ""real, live"" mealworms.And nobody likes change so I tried repeatedly serving the dried mealworms (rehydrated according to package directions)hoping the orioles would come around to liking them and no luck. I cannot recommend this product at all. I have 26 different bird species here and none appear to like the dried mealworms."
1,I agree with David Chopin,"I am glad that I did not buy this book, just got it from the library. Horrible is a word that comes to mind. The research was not thorough and I did not feel like I knew the characters at all. Also, it was a boring story when it should have been fascinating."
2,Snore............ after chapter 1,"The book starts out rather suspenseful, but after Chapter 1 it is all downhill. I had read another book by Carlton Smith and wasn't all that impressed, I gave this one a try in hopes he would redeem himself. Ooops, my bad."
4,"This is ""the"" marketer's bible!",This handy dandy guide gives a beginner like myself wonderful leverage in today's marketing realm. Jay gives a clue about how to market cost effectively and do it well. Go Jay!
5,great little known album from early 70's,"This album is one of many obscure late hippie/early hard rock era records that were a little ahead of their time.This record has it all-great guitar,great vocals and great songs.And these guys were just out of high school!There's not much filler on this.Even the slower songs are cool.Be Good and Be Kind has one of the best guitar riffs you'll ever hear.Silver Star,Personal Gain,Lady of the Opera and Endamus Finallamus are really unique and original songs.Guitarist Floyd Radford went on to play with both Edgar and Johnny Winter but it makes you wonder if Tin House could've stayed together for a few more albums what kind of original music they might have come up with."
2,"In Soviet Union, book reviews You!!","Okay, seriously. I picked this book up around 1997 I think, at Twice Sold Tales in Seattle. I got it mostly to be iconoclastic, I think, and because I was curious about what sort of stories the Russians told themselves about the future. I mean, you get to learn about a culture though its fantacies, right? Isn't that what Thrawn said? I'm afraid it's mostly a dissapointment, I found a lot of the stories to be overly short and simplistic, and I had a sense that I was loosing something in the translation. I'm going to hang on to it though and leaf through it on rainy nights. When you're a kid during the waning years of the Cold War you can't help but have a morbid curiosity about what was going on behind the Iron Curtain and this is an interesting peak at what got past the censors."
5,Best Verilog Synthsis book,"This is the best book about the Verilog Synthesis. The book is very practical, and I immediately applied many examples into my work...."
3,Delightful but fairly standard plot.,"This is a very cute harlequin-type romance. The plot, as noted in other reviews, is the typical rich girl runaway and marriage of convenience scenario. What makes this book different is Caleb's history as a child and vulnerability, his devotion to these adorable children, the heart stealing 6 children and Elthia who is klutzy and inept beyond belief but has a heart of gold. I only gave it a 3 because, to me, it's a one time read.I enjoyed it but I wouldn't read it again."
3,some problems,item usually plays for a while then will freeze and not come back and become discolored. if you saved before this then you can just go back to your save point.
2,If you don't mind the guillotine...,"Risk is kinda fun, but they didn't need the gulliontine shot at the end. This version is not for kids under 18 in my mind. If you can handle the idea of beheading the enemy at the end of every game, this game's for you. Otherwise, go buy another version. Ratings are pretty weak on most violent video games. My back cover says 9 to 49. I think this is because anyone over 49 was raised with values, and they wouldn't like the killing part that was added on to the game. Try Risk II. I don't have that one."
2,Disc 2 Unplayable!,"I experienced the same problem as a previous reviewer. Vol.1 (disc 1) plays fine like a regular CD, but disc 2 is unplayable. Very disappointing..."
4,Rubbermaid Large Drain Away,This product does what it is supposed to do.I can stack many wet dishes and a few pots and have the runoff excess water drain into the sink.Cleaning the tray is a simple as wiping with a wet sponge.I recommend this product.It was hard to find in the big box stores so Amazon was a perfect place to locate one...
2,Caveat Emptor,"This product is molded of hard plastic rather than the soft rubber one we sought to replace. It does not sit level on the counter nor prevent slippage. Worst of all, it drains on the long side, rather than the short side as our previous rubbermaid tray. Will keep scanning the big box stores to find a more suitable replacement"
5,THIS IS GOOD REPLACEMENT,"I LIKE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT REPACES THE ONE I HAD, I HAD TO PURCHASE ONLINE BECAUSE NO STORE SELLSTHIS UNIT ANYMORE"
5,Drainer Tray,Sits Vertically instead of horizontally and takes less space. Also tilted a little for water to run off.
2,Oh well,"I should have noticed it drained on the long side, they DO have it written in the description clearly, but I didn't and it isn't worth sending back. I prefer it a bit more flexible and it is so huge it becomes too much of a focal point on the counter. Oh well."
1,Crash and burn!,"I've worked with Pinnacle Studio versions 8.0, 9.0, 9.4., this one, and a later version. And they've all had two things in common:1. When the program works, it's superb.2. The other 50% of the time, it crashes frequently, and hard.For years, Pinnacle had designed the market's top, novice-affordable video editing/authoring platforms, but for some frustrating reason, they just can't seem to keep the bugs out. Pinnacle Studio Plus 700 USB Version 10.0 is no exception.Lately, the competition in this market has mushroomed, and there are better alternatives available for the same price. At last, others have emulated the Pinnacle platform while eliminating the work/creativity-killing bugs.My advice? Shop around. Google the competition. But save yourself the frustration and steer away from anything Pinnacle."
5,Don't Read This Alone,I am an assistant prosecutor who does not scare easily. This book is so wonderfully spooky that I couldn't read it at home alone. I ended up reading it in the office and still ended up with shivers. I highly recomend this book.
2,"A disturbing,kinky, voyeristic saga.","This book is difficult to read simply because of the subject matter. A kinky pervert is terrorising women and anything that moves in a small town.The main character Toby, is the antithesis of this pervert and Washburn regularly paralles normal heterosexual behaviour with abnormal sexual behaviour. Toby gradually loses his macho sex drive when he is appointed investigative detective. Interviews with the victims of these crimes causes Toby to reconsider sex games with his devoted wife Sara. The action in this book is pedantic and frustrating expecially the symbolism of Toby and Sara loading and unloading his cop guns every night. I think the author has masked his real desire to write a book about sex games"
3,Not what I expected but packed with good information,"I was expecting a larger book than I received. It comes in a small, as in size, book form. I was amazed that the book had so much information, but don't feel like I got my money worth in book. Good tips, not much book."
2,so-so,I didn't really care for this book. I thought the story line sounded very good and the basic plot was. I found the writing to be jumbled in areas. It seemed to jump around and it was a bit hard to follow. I got bored very easily. I found it to be very funny in spots and I would have loved to have read more scenes with the two raccoons. I just didn't feel the characters were developed enough to hold my interest. I hate to say this but it was a real struggle to get through this book.
3,A bit about the book.......,"Leaning out to peek at a flatboat poling up the Cumberland River, Naomi Romans falls flat on her face. Cradled in Shaw Larson's strong arms and staring up into the river peddler's pretty yellow-green eyes, Naomi finds everything changed ... even herself. The fall brought her memories back. She isn't Naomi; she is Prima Powell, the missing daughter of a New York millionaire. Bedeviled by a pair of matchmaking raccoons, befuddled by two years of lost memories, and bedazzled by Shaw's gentlest touch, Naomi is certain: She is the girl who went stumbling off so long before to find moonbows in the mist ... and now she's found something even better."
2,Nothing to gain,"While the writing is fine, if you've seen the episodes there is no point in reading the book. I didn't gain anything from Rory's point of view that couldn't be seen in the show."
4,Gilmore Girls the Other Dide OF Summer,"Amy Sherman Palladino (the author of the novel Gilmore Girls The other side of summer) wraps you up in a novel about a mother daughter bond that is absolutely irresistible, funny and loving. Roarie, (the daughter) is starting the year at a new school called Chilton. Chilton is a private school that is considered strict and apparently looks great in your college application. Throughout the book you hear about the obstacles that Roarie faces at her at her new school. While Roarie studies and her mom learns how to become a ""Chilton mom"" they stick together and get through it.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a funny, loving story. I liked the way Roarie and Lorelei (her mother) interacted with each other and the fact that they were best friends. If you are expecting suspense and cliff hangers this is not the book for you. This is definitely not my favorite book but it is what I call ""easy fun reading""."
1,This thing STINKS!,This controller is the worst one I have ever used. None of the controls seem to work right. The steering whell is VERY sensative to the touch.
2,Racing Controller has Limited Use,"This controller works great with San Francisco Rush, but terrribly with other N64 racing games (Mario Kart, Diddy Kong, etc). It isn't really useful at all for other types of games (flying, etc)."
3,"Good basic book, but leaves too much out.","I have programmed and used Word Basic, but this book left me feeling a little lost. The book was written by several people who appear to assume that some subjects will be covered in a different chapter. Other topics were covered more then once. I was disappointed and am still not able to create a comphresive macro in VBA."
2,Very general video - Doesn't cover all the questions,"I was disappointed in this video because it didn't cover a lot of the questions I have about soldering - how to keep my tip clean (use of sponge, use of a sal ammonic block), how to tin my tip, etc. Instead, Payne just covers the act of soldering. She also moves very quickly and doesn't always explain what she means, which makes it a little confusing. I was looking for a a video course in copper-foil soldering and this did not really explain to me how to correct the issues I'm having with my own soldering. While it was helfpul to see someone in the act of soldering, I didn't get $30 worth of advice from the video."
2,It's ok,It is very short and could include much more for the money. I get as much for free in youtube and free articles. I was disappointed with the amount of information given. I guess it is great if you know nothing and do not know how to browse or have dialup and can't use youtube.
1,Low quality lights,"The lights are of very low quality, breaks easily, wind rips the cap off and rings just falls off after some time.Not recommended."
3,"Ok, but I agree they break quite easily","I actually bought several sets of these for my front yard landscaping. I agree, they were extremely easy to install and looked great however the plastic stake that secures them into the ground on about half of my lights broke within the first year. The electrical connections ended up needing constant attention as well. The top caps do fly off during those windy fall days. I will say this, they haven't corroded and still look great, I just wish that the company would have just put a bit more effort into the stake that holds them into the ground and the electrical connector. I am not sure if there are any other lights out there to replace these, but I am looking for a new set and would not buy these again."
2,Low grade product,"I have had terrible luck with my entire Malibu system. These lights are made mostly of plastic, break easily, and are a general pain."
1,Bought a lot of these and regret the investment,The tops are not secure and constantly blow off in the wind. The poles that go into the ground are flimsy and easily knocked over. Replacement bulbs are expensive.
1,Poor Quality,It looks great when you install it but it won't last long. It would break after 6 months.
4,Conditioning Sport Horses,Very good well researched and balanced information. A book that all serious sport horse competitors should read/own.
4,Conditioning Sport Horses,"Very in depth, Covers all sports. I would have liked a few more exercises that would benefit the horse."
5,Very informative and many pictures,"This book really opened my eyes to the conditions in which animals are being raised. Not only is it inhumane to the animals, but it is contaminating OUR food. It has many pictures, which I like, being a visual person. Read this book and you will find it very educational."
3,"He can write a good sentence, but overall his work is just bearable.","I am a huge short story fan and was excited to pick this book up. I hadn't heard of it previously but reviews seemed good enough and I quite liked the title. The first story alone did not enrapture me as I'd hoped it would, but I read on. When I finished the last story, I was relieved that I could finally move on to a new book. That's how I felt during many of the stories: wondering when it would be over or if there would be a conclusion or gripping last line that would make it worth it. There never was. Throughout the 300 some odd pages in this collection, there were several instances where I fell in love with a sentence. Perlman surely holds the ability to write a fantastic sentence, but it rarely translates through an entire story. I enjoyed some of the characters but all these stories later, nothing stands out. A mediocre work, but possible to get through, so with that I give it 3 stars."
5,Yasmin: The doll valued most!,I strongly think that Yasmin is the best Bratz Doll. She fits many people's background and is just a crowd pleaser! You couldn't see my household without a Yasmin Doll! Whether its a sportz one or a funk out one. I HIGHLY recommend you to get a yasmin whether it is your first or last bratz doll!
1,MISREPRESENTED,THIS ITEM IS REALLY A CONAIR FB27 THAT SELLS FOR $25.49 THEY CHARGED ME $100 BUT AMAZON GAVE MY MONEY BACK.Duro-Med Massaging Foot Spa
5,Audio/Visual,Track Listings1. James Dean (I Wanna Know)2. Gotta Get Thru This - Acoustic Version3. James Dean (I Wanna Know) - ATFC's committed vocal4. James Dean (I Wanna Know) - VIDEO
3,average,"I found this book average to disappointing. The title led me to expect an emphasis on Torah and ancient teachings, but the book was full of modern secular studies. I think there are other better parenting books available with stronger religious supporting information."
5,Helpful for ALL ages,This is a useful book for teenagers to read too! He talks about working on yourself and developing good habits - definately something we teenagers have to work on. I loved it and it helped me change a lot of areas in my life.
5,"refreshing, practical and up-to-date","I found kelemen's book a change from the ordinary 'spend quality time with your kids stuff'.Firstly it offers real practical advice. Secondly it's got a load of scientific evidence to back up the ideas presented (having said that, its the type of book your grandmother would have told you was common sense and everybody in her day knew all of it naturally). Thirdly the author brings in a lot of ancient wisdom, which i find very appealing."
4,"Dissapointed with the ""Wrangler Jeans Ad"" no audio.","I own the australian version of this and the ""Wrangler Jeans Ad"" has an early version of ""Yellow Brick Road"" as the soundtrack. The american version has a message at the beginning explaining that due to copyright issues they were not able to add the original soundtrack, so you just get the video and no audio!I bought this initially so I could replace my australian version, cant do that."
1,Poor instructions,"Whatever you do, don't throw away the package with the instructions. If you are at all like me and don't remember what you read six months ago, you cannot use this glue a second time. The majority of the tube has a different language. Oh, and the tube states, ""Read complete directions on package"". Useless."
1,Won't Even Stick to Itself,"Don't waste your time or money. Remember ""model airplane glue""? It smells the same, yet bonds even worse. I've been trying to glue a rubber eye cup back onto a camera for hours now with no success. I'm thinking I'd have more luck with Elmer's craft glue at this point.Worthless..."
1,GoopAll-Purpose Contact Household Adhesive,"If you are purchasing this to ""have around"", be aware that the first time you use it may be the only time you can use it - for exposure to air seems to activate the whole tube, over time, to turn to a rubbery substance. Which amounts to a lot of waste. Some of the reviews look like they were written by the company themselves. This one is written by a customer who just tried to use the tube for the second time and has found the entire tube has gelled...even when I cut through the metal of the tube's center. Can't recommend this product. Very disappointing!"
1,How do you use this again?,"No instructions on container. If you threw away the wrap (and who doesn't?), you can't even tell what surfaces this can and can't be used on, or whether there is any special procedure to be followed other than ""apply and stick."" Ridiculous packaging, and I'm guessing it's pretty toxic as well, since it looks like it's been discontinued. I'm tossing mine, and won't consider anything else from this maker."
4,Great if you have skinny ankles,"This boot is not really red, its more of a purple color, or close to magenta, but more purple. Its very pretty and comfy, but if you don't have very skinny ankles, it doesn't tie well. I had to buy longer leathers to get mine tied up and there is a large gap even though I wouldn't consider my legs fat at all, just not model skinny. The price of these boots are high enough that this is a bit of a problem for me, but I didn't send them back. I'll probably sell them or give them to someone with smaller ankles. They're very cool looking."
3,Beautiful boots....if they fit!,"I gave them 3 stars because I like the boot. Yet, they were mismarked and I was sent a size 6.The package tags said both a 6 and the desired 8. So, I can see where there was confusion. Had to return and you were sold out of 8's. :("
5,STELLAR MELLOW JAZZ W/ ATTITUDE,Stellar soundtrack from amazing Robert Mitchum movie. Also stars THE Japanese Steve McQueen-Ken Tananaka (sp)Lovely package. Mitchum should have been Popeye Doyle (French Connection).
1,LT. CALLEY INSPIRED FILM,"Frank (John Savage) returns from Vietnam and promptly rats out his commander by spilling his gut to the media about war crimes...something that wasn't new. Frank wants to live a quiet peaceful life in his small Texas town by hanging out at a bar where everyone hates him. He meets a sweetie (Maria Socas) who wants him to run guns for her to a small South American country. As the town rednecks close in on Frank...Not too hard to figure out where this leads.The film doesn't get any better in South America. There is some action. It looks like they actually blew up some stuff to make this film. The characters were cardboard. The dialouge put me to sleep. The plot was a yawner. Fairly sad film all around. Not a great action film or war film, or drama, or romance.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. If Lt. Calley should be shot for anything, it should be for inspiring this dog film."
3,Blood of the Prodigal,"This is the first book in the Ohio Amish Mysterys by this author. It starts a little slow, but don't give up,it gets better. Each book in the series is a little better than the last. I am on the 4th one and can say I have really enjoyed reading them. These books are suitable for all ages and pretty good reads."
2,2 issues in 4 years,"I've had this washer since 05 and it's been OK. 2 years ago it wouldn't start due to a carb problem and I just noticed that it's making a very loud ringing noise. Another trip to the mechanic.In general, it's very loud, vibrates excessively and has variable pressure issues where the pressure goes up and down for no particular reason. I would not buy this again. As a matter of fact...after it's repaired...I'm selling it and I'll just rent one if needed."
4,Live recordings!,"I didn't realize when I bought this that the songs are all live recordings. I was a little disappointed, but I got over it quickly enough once I'd given the songs a good listen.Despite the occasional sounds of the audience, the quality of the recordings is very good! There is some audience participation, but not enough to detract from listening."
4,Worked better than others,"I've only been using this about a week and a half now, but I've seen good results. I have really sensative skin that can break out a lot if it isn't treated right. My T-Zone also usually gets really oily throughout the day. I used this cleanser morning and night. The first couple of days I think your skin has to get used to it. It might feel tight. But after that I saw a noticeable amount of oil reduction. Usually my nose will be oily again by 3rd period at school, after washing my face in the morning, but now it seems to stay drier furthur throughout the day.I know it sounds weird, but one of the ingredients is Beeswax, and I really think you can tell the beeswax is working. I guess it helps make your face more matte. I liked it. So far I haven't had any new acne breakouts since I've been using it. Oh yeah, it also smells good."
2,Doesn't last very long,"This stuff is kind of expensive, so I expected it to have a little bit of staying power, but for this price, it fades way too quickly in my opinion. The first thing I noticed about this perfume is a sharp, pine-sol smell, which was very disappointing because I don't care for woodsy type fragrances. But after about 30 minutes, it mellowed into more of a fruity, vanilla musk type scent, which was much better. Unfortunately, about an hour later, the scent was completely gone."
5,"Hands down, my favorite scent!","I love this perfume, I've been wearing it for years and I love the way it smells on me. It's a woodsy/fruity perfume, so if that doesn't mix will with your body chemistry, this perfume isn't for you. It lasts for me all day (and even changes a little-almost another scent), but I only use EDP, and I never rub the scent together after spraying it (it changes the scent)."
3,Basic 2 track DC wiring,"If you're model railroad is 2 rail (vs 3) and DC (vs AC), this book covers all the basics that you'll need to wire your layout. If you're looking for 3 rail AC wiring advice, look elsewhere"
3,KNOW WHAT YOU WANT BEFORE YOU BUY,"ALTHOUGH WELL WRITTEN AND CLEAR, THIS PUBLICATION IS DIRECTED ONLY TO TWO RAIL MODEL RAILROADS. IF YOU WANT INFO ON THREE RAIL GO ELSEWHERE."
1,No-budget torture horror,"Live Animals is an ultra-low budget kidnapping/torture/horror film with a one-line plot, no twists, no shocks, little gore and lots of tedium.There's really nothing to recommend it. The villains are dull and the victims duller.Skip it."
1,This movie was so bad I wanted to torture myself...,I hate worthless zero budget crapfests like this. I would ask that indie filmmakers stop asking their friends to write glowing reviews for these worthless productions. Its misleading and shameful.
1,ugh....,"So a group of young adults get kidnapped and tortured so they would learn to behave then once broken they could be sold off to a slave ring of some sort..one would think this would be fairly intersting, graphic, gut wrenching and ect...however...I found this movie to be extremely boring. My friend announced what he thought was going to happen and he ended up being correct in his assumption. The insane woman in the stable was annoying with her constant singing and also by keeping her there instead of doing away with her leads the viewer to believe she is more than what one would think. Also, if this is suppose to be some sort of torture/horror flick, I found the torture sceens to be sort of bland."
1,Watching this movie was a waste of my time.,Horrible movie. Horrible acting. Excessively melodramatic. Very predictable plot. One of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.
2,Hostel: The Rippoff,"Live Animals is about a group of young adults who are kidnapped and tortured by a group of psychos, who plan on selling them to the highest bidder. The movie is a ripoff of the Hostel movies and the Saw films. It has a low-budget, bad acting, and plot holes every two minutes. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
1,more time spent wasted,"Live Animals is just that, a waste of time... The acting is garbage the gore and effects are awful, the make up might has well be done with finger paints. This movie has literally no budget and it shows. Don't get me wrong I really enjoy lowrent B movies but this one just doesnt cut it whatsoever. I put this movie in not expecting a original plot line, I honestly don't care what so ever that its completely unoriginal. We all know sometimes we just need something new to watch cause we've already seen all the goods every where else.The fact that this movie can even be compared to or categorized with Hostel or the Saw films is just insulting. For a side note I picked this movie up for $5 and I still have to complain about its unenthusiastic attempt at a torture flick. Honestly don't waste your time even if you've already seen all the splatter and torture movies everywhere else."
2,"""All Blues""","Most of Oscar Brown's music is worthless. Maybe 5% is acceptable (e.g. ""Worksong""). But one, only one, is fantastic and absolutely classic: Brown's version of the classic Miles Davis ""All Blues."""
1,LOOKS ARE DECEIVING,"Revised: They ""seemed"" to be of good quality until I used them. The metal is too soft for manual use, much less impact use. Those jokers across the sea got us again!These seem to be of a very good quality - at least for someone who does not make a living with them using them every day. There are 14 sockets, and a case (total of 15). The case is just enough for the sockets, so there is no handle."
1,Poor quality- don't buy,"I wore out one of the sockets tightening four bolts to 75 ft/lb. I needed to tighten two of the bolts to 90 ft/lb but at this point the socket was stripped out so I couldn't. Luckily I'm not tightening anything important... just the suspension on my car :-) These sockets are weak and no good for serious use. I am not sure whats up but the box that mine came in doesn't look exactly like the photo. The vendor I purchased them from is ""ALS Group Inc."""
5,Very gentle,"I picked this up on a whim while I was out shopping for my usual face care. This quickly became my new skin care regime since it left my skin so soft and clean. I am really disappointed that this is being discontinued but at least I can get a few bottles here before it's all gone. I have dry and sensitive skin. This is great for travel since my skin always gets oily when I am in the car for a long time, road grime I suppose. A few minutes washing your face with this and all is well again."
3,fun but cheap,the cane was cheaply made and not suitable for walking. the blade was dull and the skull is just painted silver not steel or anything
4,Perfect for Halloween,"Not exactly the sturdiest cane, but it definately did the job. Was the perfect final detail to my Halloween costume."
5,Worth the money,"Just an excellent disc with a very broad range of music. You can tell easily this artist ""feels"" his music."
5,Great game but...,"I purchased this game as a Christmas gift for my fiancee. He loves the game and had previously owned it but it became too scratched for game play. Upon buying it, it was the most expensive game I purchased despite it being an old game. That was my only problem, otherwise the game works great and my fiancee is still living out his college football dream through this game."
2,USC/Texas 2005???,"OK, so where the heck is Vince Young, Matt Leinart, and Reggie Bush in this version? You see Reggie Bush on the cover, so you think you're going to get the opportunity to play with the Heisman Trophy winner, pair him up with Lendale White and Matt Leinart, and take on the Longhorns to try and replay the Rose Bowl. But none of these players are to be found. In fact, Ohio State is listed as the #1 team.Am I behind the times? Or is this how EA Sports does their football games? Do I need to buy NCAA 06 in order to use these players in their prime? I was hoping to be able to play them with updated ""abilities"" that would reflect all of their outstanding years in 2005.Any ideas out there? Is this a code or a ""cheat"" I need to unlock?HELP!!!"
3,Heisman cover,"Nooo, the Heisman winner isn't always the one who makes the cover. Remember the Larry Fitzgerald cover? He didn't win the Heisman"
4,My Review Of NCAA Football 2007,"The 2007 edition of the EA video game franchise has new features, like Campus Legend, where your player decides whether he goes the to the NFL or stay as a college coach, and Spring Drills, where your favorite team square off in a Spring-time scrimmage. Above all else, there are still the same game modes from the previous NCAA Football games like Rivalry Game, Mascot Game, Dynasty and a selection of Div.1-Football Championship Subdivision teams. This is the great video game to pass the time and can be used with only the Madden 2007 game."
5,Grandsons well pleased !!,My two grandsons ages 11 and 9 love this game . They found it easy to play. They love playing the different colleges. They cannot wait for 2008 to come out.
3,Same old..,"First of all, for the guy below me, no u cant be reggie bush in NCAA 07...hes not in the NCAA anymore. I can ask Madden to let me have TO and McNabb on the same team in their game. They put graduated stars on the cover so they can actually be paid for it. Anyways...same game again from EA. For those of you that buy this every year because you have nothing to do until Madden comes out, or just live for the dynasty mode, youll be dissapointed. Gameplay has some new animations, but they are off set by RB's celebrating 1 yard gains and the same pre/post game cut scenes theyve had for 3 years. For you dynasty players, prepare to once again go back to muting the TV and running winamp on the computer due to the fact that its back to the fight songs. EA comes out with some really good music on their games and i dont know why they dropped the music again for this game (zzzzzzzzz). Its a 3 at best because its last years and the year before thats game, with new rosters....as usual"
1,My thoughts,"Well, i have a 4 year old sister (im 13) and my sister wanted this doll so bad! she whinied and cryed. my mom wouldn't get becausee her and i think that its wrong. Why cant we just stick with the bird coming and dropping down the baby story? When i was 5 my parents told me i was a pototoe they had bought at a shop got Big K... i mean i gave it a 5 stars for educational, if you wanteddd your child to learn about sex"
5,Post-It addict,"Yes, I love Post-Its in ALL colors and have a billion of them. These colors are a bit drab to my taste, but I wanted the purple ones, so I got them. They're just fine."
2,"good decorating ideas, but no bouquet ideas","This book was not very helpful to me. It had some good ideas for decorating, but what I was wanting was a book to give me ideas for different brides maids and bridal bouquets. It did not give any ideas as far as different flowers for different arrangements. It is a good book if all you are looking for is a book to give you decorating ideas. Not different flower ideas."
3,"No how-to's, but lots of wonderful arrangment ideas!","I just bought this book, I love the arrangements. It contains pages of sophisticated and classic arrangements. There are some very elegant ideas for wedding decorations too. I'm using at least three ideas from here for my niece's bridal shower, and plan to use it as reference for the wedding. NO HOW-TO's though... would have been nice. This is definately a book you buy for the pictures, but not to learn floral arranging."
3,Fussy,This book I found was very fussy. I just felt it was a bit over the top for a bride. I did love the colour's and flower's though.
5,This product works great,"Apart from minor mess, this thing shrinks those hemorrhoids overnight, what a relief. I didnt use the complete tube at one go, but used a lil bit daily until seven days and all was good thereafter. A little bit messy though, but very effective than most OTC preparations. Highly Recommended."
5,Desperately trying anything to avoid surgery and this did the trick,"I am 50 years old and have had hemeroids most of my adult life. I have had them cut out over and over and was told that I should consider surgery if I had another episode. Well the next episode ocurred and I did not want to go the surgical route. I found this stuff on the internet and had one of the local grocery store pharmacys order it for me. It kept me from having surgery and it has bee about 5 years since I have had a problem. Today, I ordered some more as I am beginning to feel the symptoms for the first time since. It did not work all at once, but after about a day, I had tremendous relief and then no hemeroids until now. For me that is incredible. Get this stuff."
1,"Don't be fooled by ""1-application"".","Don't be fooled by the ""1-application"" hype. If you want the advantage of ""1-application"", the instructions say to insert the tip and squeeze the entire contents into your rectum, thus using the entire tube in ""1-application"".The main ingredient is charcoal, so even if you use it like it an ordinary product, you get BLACK EVERYWHERE. UNBELIEVABLE!"
2,Not worth the money,"I had high hopes for this product when I read about it... One application - cool! Maybe this will help take care of those painful little buggers. Well, I was disappointed by two things.1) The One-application claim does NOT mean that you'll be cured after one use of the product. What it does mean is that you're supposed to use this ENTIRE tube in one use. Okay, so you'll need to buy multiple tubes to follow their recommended dosage. Very expensive (not to mention messy).2) While it did provide some relief from the symptoms at first, it later became uncomfortable and was a terrible mess to clean up afterward.Save your money. Go to a doctor instead and get the problem solved. Otherwise, I'd recommend sticking to the usual over the counter ointments and such. They cost much less and worked better in the long run."
3,ok,I've had this gun for about 2 or 3 months and yesterday it started failing and today the aluminum rod came out >:(
3,Not what i thought I was gonna get,"The gun itself LOOKS very nice, however, a messy paint job was done towards the barrel of the gun. They painted black over some of the orange tip of the barrel On the box it says 180 fps...so pretty weak and with .20 bbs it would be about 160 fps. When I received the package it was very light and on the box it says to my surprise just 1 pound. the gun weighs one pound. I'm also missing the strap for my gun...I'm very dissatisfied with what I received from Lastworld/Amazon."
5,Amazing,"This is a must have beginner's gun it is smaller than a real m4 but still packs a punch. .12g bbs curve left and right but .20g bbs go straight so I would recommend using .20g bbs. This gun probably shoots 250 fps which is good for beginners of Airsoft. It comes with 2 mags, a strap, some sample bbs (.12g) and an unjamming rod. Again get this gun you won't regret it!"
2,"Fun, but not for long","This gun is awesome. It shoots great and everything. Read all the other reviews for how good it is. I had it for two days working fine, then I used some bio bbs, it gets jammed, I un-jam it, it only shoots about 8ft. It now sucks. I dont know why, but I still feel that this is a good product, but I cant nessicarly blame a bb. I'm just not very happy about this and have no idea what to do. Buy it if you want. I dont care. Well is a good company, only if you buy the expensive stuff. I would recommend getting something better by Well, UTG, JG, CYMA, Double Eagle, or any others. You just cant buy cheap. Dont make the same mistakes I've made."
3,"ok, for the price","it is an acceptable gun. i am new to airsoft and, it was pretty ok as a starter aeg. there are defenetly some cons though. it is very weak for starter. my dad and i very having an airsoft battle and, he was in the tall grass. i tried to shoot at him but, it did not have the range or pwr to hit him. i finally got closer and, he shoot me in the head. i spent LOTS of time trying to get it to shoot, it is hard to get to shoot. the magazines are not very good, they constanty mess up. the intructions are in japenese 1st and, english 2nd so, the translation is wierd and, does not tell you everything.bottom line, fine for shooting your friends in your backyard, cheapif you are an at all experienced player, spend more money and get like a 50-100 dollar gun, don't be cheapthere are other guns for the price, i have decided not to buy WELL guns anymore, not very good"
2,Its To Small,"When I got it, it worked great, it hade an adjustable stock. The one thing is that it was tiny. Overall, its an ok buy."
3,????,is the gun full metal i wanted to know cuz if it is i dont want to spend 100 more dollars on a full metal one
2,Crap,The gun dosent shoot farther than 15 feet and the clips brake it like 4 days. And theres not where else to buy new ones.
5,Phenominal,"I had this gun given to me as a gift several years ago for Christmas. Since then, it's been through hell and high water; rain, mud, snow, wars, etc. I've used it relable as my primary weapon for all my wars in the last three years. Now, of course, I don't abuse it, but it's been under some stress. Totally customizable, too. I've upgraded the battery to fire twice as fast, added a Trijicon scope, and went ahead and put on a masterkey. I love it. Theres also been complaints about the accuracy. I have to admit it is not the best, but .20g BBs fix the majority of that. When I take the shotgun and scope off, I stick a bipod and a SAW mag on it for support. It is fantastic, reliable, and robust. Half of my guns break with a quarter of the damage this things done. Easily one of the best AEGs under $50."
2,Just OK,Bulky. Attachment does not seat well. Suction much less than expected. I would not buy this product again.
3,Great suction power,"When I first purchased this hand held, it worked excellent. The suction power was awesome! But after just one month the belt came off. It took me thirty minutes to put it back on only for it to come off again.I returned it to where I purchased it from and thought I would try another one. Well, when I got the new one home, it did not have a belt on the roller!!I'm going to try one more time. This is the last time!!!"
1,Very disappointed,I needed to replace my old Dirt Devil hand vac and read all the reviews about hand vacs and finally chose the 100 Classic. Amazon sent it promptly and I was happy...until I tried to attach the hose. The attachment clips onto the bottom of the vac and as soon as I moved the hose it fell off. I asked my 18 year old son to try to attach it and the same thing happened. I called the 800 number enclosed with the machine and after 2 days I finally got to speak to a human. He had no idea what I was talking about. I dont think he even had a picture of the model available. Finally he told me to return it to the store.I am very disappointed with the Dirt Devil and with their customer service. Perhaps they should spend less on advertising and more on product development and service.
1,Buy a LOT of filters,"I loved the Dirt Devil hand-vac I had in the 90's. The new one, however, has lousy suction. That's because the air filter becomes clogged after about five minutes of use. The owner's manual says that you need to ""periodically"" tap the air filter to remove excess dirt. It also says you need to replace the air filters every 3-6 months. In my experience, I found I needed to replace the air filters after 30-60 minutes of use. I can't afford that. I'm back to lugging around my full-size vacuum with its attachments."
1,What Junk ! !,"This is the third Dirt Devil handheld I have owned. Over the last 10-12 years they have increasingly lowered the quality of their product. This current model is very LOUD, the attachment for the hose is made out of plastic and already broke. What a piece of junk ! ! I made my own strap attachment so I could use it on high shelves in my home; the strap works great, but the exhaust comes out the sides and gets hot while the vacuum rests against my side.The paper filters are expensive and get clogged quickly. This reduces suction. I am sure that is their goal - just keep buying those filters. You can blow the dirt off them and reuse for awhile. My recommendation is to look at other brands."
2,Noisy and inconvenient,"For just about any application where I want a handheld vacuum cleaner instead of a canister or upright, I feel I'm better off with an 18V cordless model with a brushroll. It's going to be just as useful for cleaning up cat litter or food spills or vacuuming the stairs or upholstery, plus I can take it to the car (or with the car), and it's so much more convenient not dealing with a power cord. While this product might be more powerful than a cordless, applications where you need the extra power also tend to require more reach (no stooping or getting down on your hands and knees) and bigger capacity.And the noise, OMG. Turn this vacuum on and dogs will howl, cats will hide, flocks of birds will take to the skies, neighbors will bang on the walls."
4,Works great when the belt doesn't break,"The vacuum works great! Yes, it blows things around on the floor but you have to out smart the thing and go at the right angle. All handheld vacs blow everything around and I know from experience. I know people with different handhelds and I tried different ones that were out for demos. This little vac picks up so much on any floor. My only problem is that the belts are junk. Maybe my belts were old rubber though. One belt broke the second time I used it, the next belt broke a week later, two more times later. I ordered different belts that are not actually dirt devil so maybe that will work better. The hepa filter is best to be smacked to the ground, as with ALL hepa filters in any vacuum. That is the very best way to get all the dust and dirt out of it. As always, every hepa filter needs to be replaced at some point. If companies made things that didn't require some self maintenance, we would go broke replacing items because it would be more frequent."
2,Incredibly cheap construction,"This model might look like the old Dirt Devil handhelds, but it's nowhere close to the same quality. I've used this vacuum three times. It has the potential to be a great product. But each time I used it, something broke.The whole unit is made almost entirely of plastic, and there are quality issues with the manufacturing and assembly. The tubing for the accessories doesn't fit snugly. The ends of the hoses should all be round, but they simply aren't molded properly. Instead, the wand attachment is oblong and doesn't make a tight seal.The attachment hose snaps onto the underside of the vacuum. It's a bit odd, but the real problem is that the only thing to sealing the two pieces together is a piece of glued-on foam. It started to peel off on day one, and now I've lost about half of the suction.Just today, the dustbin latch snapped off. Three strikes. This thing is headed back for a refund."
3,Works ok for the price,"Bought this to replace my old Royal hand held for doing the stairs. Considering the price, it works pretty well (for now). Picks up most stuff if you go over it a few times. It is lightweight which is a real bonus and the cord is long enough to go up a pretty long flight of stairs. My main complaint is that it blows air and particles out of the sides and into my face which makes me wonder how much dirt is blowing back into the room as well. I also don't think the suction power it has will last very long as the filter is totally covered with dirt after one pass on the stairs (which aren't that dirty). Kind of messy to clean out and can't get all the dirt out of the slits in the filter. Only used it twice so far and the filter is filthy despite my best efforts to clean it. Overall, I guess you get what you pay for. It is a ok for the price paid but I don't think it will last anywhere near as long as my trusty old Royal did."
2,Stopped Working at 2 month mark,"I clean out the filter after every use because it works so well. I cannot believe how much dirt, dust, and dog hair it picks up. So imagine my surprise today when it just stopped working and I have used it maybe 10 times..."
3,OK but nothing special,"Seems to be reasonably well built. I plugged it into a Kill-a-Watt meter, and it read 5.55 amps, 636 watts. Power seems OK for upholstery and car seats as long as deep suction is not required.The design of the attachments renders them essentially useless. There is so much suction leakage that the attachment hose couldn't pick up loose sand from the car floor mat. For that kind of work, this definitely won't compete with the old Eureka Mighty Mite.It comes with a spare belt. Cleanup of the dirt chamber and filter is not difficult."
4,Great little vacuum,"Pros- really takes care of dog hair on furniture and stairs. Easy to use, easy cleanup. I don't think it's too heavy or too loud.Cons- none really. Maybe it doesn't quite get into corners; I would have liked a 25 foot cord instead of a 20 foot, but that's being a little nitpicky.I recommend this to anyone, whether you have pets or not. I also got an extra filter from GoVacuum.com. Their service was great"
2,Did not meet my requirements,"The Dirt Devil is a rather heavy hand held machine that seemed quite powerful at first. Unfortunately, I needed a machine that could handle fine wood ash that often ends up on the hearth of my in-wall hybrid wood stove/fireplace. This fine ash clogs the filter almost immediately and the filter is almost impossible to clean. The filter is not washable. So the suction went from very good to very poor. I ended up reselling this machine and buying a much lighter and much more utilitarian Dust Buster with a washable filter that doesn't clog nearly as easily. I'm sure the Dirt Devil would be much more satisfactory for larger particulate dirt but for very fine ash, it failed miserably."
2,Why did they change it?,"I own an original dirt devil hand vac, but it's on its last leg. I thought I'd prepare myself for the departure and get a replacement. What better way than by getting the improved ""classic"" model. Well, It's not what I was expecting. The R&D department missed the mark on this one. The only thing I like about it is the slick look; that's about all it has going for it. Why they got rid of the old bag system, I'll never know. Now, every time I turn this puppy on, I'm emptying it out every 3-5 minutes; and that takes about 3-5 minutes of my time. The hepa filter system should be the way to go, but in this case, it's just a lot of extra work for the consumer. The original hand vac is by far the real ""classic."""
2,Only good without attachment,"The attachment that allows you to use the other tools (crevice,brush etc)has a rubber liner that from the first day I used it was loose and falling off.Didn't take long for it to drop off completely.No way to get back on and as a result the attachments are not getting any sucking power.So if attachments are important to you-find another vacuum."
4,improved classic,"we had an old 102, the original classic,aprx. 20 years old. the cord broke at the housing in the handle,26 bucks for a new cord, 39 bucks for a new vac,( and i didn't have to put the cord on) no brainer,all we use it for is the front stairs, the old one worked just fine, the new one can suck the staples out of the pad. i'm a little leary about the furniture cause the cushions aren't attached. hepa filter clogs pretty fast, but i just blow it out with my compressor. no bags works also, very easy to empty, whole back comes off to clean inside and access filter. very worthwhile upgrade"
4,"Nice vac, but attachments are worthless","The vac seems to have good suction and the carpet brush works well. I would be careful of the hands around the brush as it is more exposed in the handheld model and could get caught in it. On carpet we noticed a good deal of pickup to it is ideal for stairs.Now for the bad part, the suction for the attachment hose is extremely poor to the point you might ask why include them at all."
5,Loads of power in the little machine!,"I was pleasently surprised at the cleaning power of the Dirt Devil 0100. I cleaned furniture, carpet areas that a regular vacuum would not reach! It worked great!"
4,Dirt Devo; 00100 Classic Hand Vac,This Vac has a lot of power and picks up well. It is a little heavier than I expected. There are plenty of attachments to get in to small spaces.
5,A best buy,"We purchased our new Dirt Devil through Amazon.com and so far it has been a ""best buy"" for us in quite a while. It is a great cleaning tool with better than average suction & attachments easy to install. This is our 2nd Dirt Devil, our first one lasting 20 years or more, and we are as pleased with this one as we were the first. Also the service we received from Amazon was quite commendable. It was no more than 3 days from ordering on line to the delivery to our door. One cannot expect more or better service than that. Hooray for amazon.com!Dirt Devil Ultra Power Handheld Vacuum"
5,New Hand Held Dirt Devil,The bag-less Dirt Devil has much more suction and cleans faster with less effort. I love it.
4,Powerful Little Sucker,"I bought this specifically for pet cleanup and other small tasks. I really like it.It picks up cat hair very well and does a great job on all of the surfaces that I have tried so far. The filter is easy to access for cleaning and the dust cup is easy to empty.My only hangup with this vac is the way the accessory nozzle attaches to the machine. It works pretty well but will come off a little too easily for me to love it. It works OK, but just could use a little refining. Definately not a deal breaker though. I would buy it again."
3,powerful but has some faults,"Although this little machine is very powerful, I have found that the attachments don't connect properly (maybe i just got a faulty attachment?), which is really annoying. Make sure you don't vacuum up any shoestrings or the like because it doesn't take much to derail the belt (fairly easy to fix)."
5,Great Vacuum!,I've had the Dirt Devil Classic for several weeks now. Got it on sale here for $40! Plus free shipping - can't beat that. The vacuum was to replace a DustBuster rechargeable. The battery on the rechargeable just didn't last long enough and it didn't pick up cat hair worth a darn. We have 2 cats and they sleep on the couches at night so I have to vacuum the couches every few days. The Dirt Devil's brush spins great and the suction is powerful enough to easily remove cat hair. Having a belt is great and a replacement belt comes in the box. Cleaning out the filter isn't that hard. Go easy on it since it is a paper filter. It has a long cord so I can walk around with it. All in all I'm very happy with it
1,Too much hassle,"We've had this for a year. It cleans carpets and upholstery very well, floors/bare stairs not well. We don't use the accessories because the cheap attachment tabs broke off on first use. Overall, it is a poorly engineered product. The on-off switch is difficult to operate; the lid at the back for emptying is very difficult to open; the filter housing is extremely difficult to remove.I am sure there are equivalent machines that also clean well but are not completely aggravating to use."
3,poorly designed,"Within the first minute out of the box, the shield folded over backward. The shield is held in place by a small plastic bar that fits in a groove. Any slight movement causes the bar to become dislodged from the groove and folds the shield backwards. We fixed it about five times in the first ten minutes. My son then asked if we could return it and choose a better squirt gun."
1,weak,it really is terrable and my cps 1500 can put eh shild down in a second making you vulnerable to fire or water also the shild breaks somewhat easily if you use a powerful gun and its stream is really tiny and cant soak anyone and the crank makes it so inacurate you couldnt soak anyone if you had a big stream finally it breaks soooooo easy just go on ebay and buy any cps for your own sake
1,this is a load of crap!!!,"ok this water gun sucks i wasted 15 bucks on this pece of junk.the sheild is worthless it cant even stop the small beam on the flash flood! the sheild blaster 3000 is a better bet!! 4 sure.the gun gets waaaay 2 heavy after a while.all the strap does is hurt.if u were 2 buy a water gun 4 15 bucks get the 2 secret strikes or the Artic Shock! this is a bad gun 4 any body....be a freind please,dont buy itp.s this gun is made by mattel not hasbro so complain 2 them not hasbro!"
3,I am so wierded out.,wow all the blasts are the same. the tripple shot only about 5 feet. I mean if u want a real water gun get somthing made by super soaker (not includeing the hydroblade) its ok but not good for big water fights. Its heavy and it barey even holds any water. This is jon sighning off. 
1,Great Concept :: Not a good soaker,"I bought the Shield Blaster 2000 awhile ago, and I must say, it is not the greatest gun if you're in a water war. It's great for little kids (The 1000 may be better), but if you're 7 or above, you want a better soaker. The stream of water is very weak, it leaks sometimes, and the shield is easily breakable. I deflected a lot of blasts from really strong guns, but I was really careful. All in all, this is not the greatest gun (I do not believe this was manufactured by Super Soker, so don't criticize them if you have complaints)."
2,"Fun, though not worth your money",I thought this water gun was heavy and hard to crank. My friend doged all of my shoots by just running around. The firing is fast but not accurate.
3,Transitional Chic Organization Work,"This album represents the bridge between Chic's main body of work and their 1984 oddity Believer. Bernard Edwards' solo project saw him flirting with drum machines and synthesizers, but without having the music overwhelmed as it was on Believer. The album has Nile Rodgers playing guitar on several tracks, Chic singers Alfa Anderson and Luci Martin providing choral vocal duties, and Jocelyn Brown providing lead vocals on several tracks. There is a Smokey Robinson remake and several ballads. On the title track, Edwards reunites with both Nile Rodgers and Tony Thompson for what is in effect a Chic track. The lyrics didn't match those of Chic or Sister Sledge, but Edwards gets to try out his interesting voice on several cuts. Overall, this album stands closer to Chic work than Rodgers' solo lp's do."
3,Buddhist influence upon Jesus?,"If genuine, this fragment may show evidence of Buddhist influence upon Jesus & upon the Essenes, as it mentions SEVEN (7) levels of consciousness.One must assume that Mary of Magdala & Jesus were possibly the only 2 apostles who could read & write fluently."
3,a little objectivity please....,"In all this debate about Mary Magdelene (and now Judas), one all-important fact seems to elude us ""enlightened"" moderns: the Church Fathers, who established the official canon at the Council on Nicaea, lived nearly 1600 years closer to the time of Christ than we do. That means that the apostolic Traditions, which they strove to follow, were much fresher in memory; in other words: there were only 400 years of transmission of those traditions. 1600 years later, along come the moderns, suddenly boasting that now we know what REALLY happened with Christ and His followers! This is the height of pride. The Church Fathers were not dreaming or pleasing their own ideological fancies, as most moderns are in these matters; they were striving to strictly adhere to the truths and sacred memories that were passed down to them, in an unbroken line of apostolic succession. Think of that before dismissing their decisions about rejecting certain texts."
1,Seemed preachy,"Given the relative neglect of Mary Magdalene by the orthodox Church, her role for the Cathars, and given that this gospel's text intrigues me, a helpful commentary of this Gospel would be welcome.It's not this one: the commentary is mostly LeLoup's advice, not particularly gnostic and not focused so much on this gospel. There seems to be little attention to any relevant conditions of the times when the Gospel was written. At times the commentary sounds like pop psychology. I'm afraid I didn't learn anything from Leloup's commentary.Fortunely, an outstanding commentary on the Gospel of Mary exists: ""The Gospel of Mary of Magdala: Jesus and the Woman Apostle"" by Karen King of Harvard Divinity School."
4,bible thumpers beware,"I can see very well why the people who believe that the present day bible is the absolute authority on ancient christianity would dislike this work. I found it thoughtful and thought provoking. And a threat, like all the gnostic texts, to the narrow minded who hold on to the vision that there is only one side to the teachings of jesus and early christians"
1,Blatant B.S.,Just another blatant attempt to corrupt the sacred scriptures. Elitest gnostic prattle that gives hope to those who would rewrite the Bible in order to create God in man's image instead of the reverse.
2,Draw Some Conclusions of Your Own First,"The Gospel of Mary MagdaleneJean-Yves LeloupForward by Jacob NeedlemanScholarly and contemplative this translation of the Gnostic Text as well as the commentary seems to warrant continued study of the scripture. The gospel itself is brief as are the author's comments. The book has the flavor of psychology and academia leaving most readers looking for something more pertinent to life today. I did like Leloup's comments on the value of the Divine Feminine and the Imaginal, a feminine domain. First read the Gospel of Mary Magdalen on line drawing some intuitive conclusions of your own. Then use this or other works to broaden your vision."
3,"Just the text, please.","I was looking for the basic texts of the Gnostic Gospels, not an in depth analysis. I prefer to draw my own theories and conclusions when it comes to religion. The author has done a great amount of research."
2,Useless without properly calibrated scanner,"In order to calibrate your printer, you have to print and then scan the calibration target. Because of this, your printer calibration will only be as good as your scanner's calibration. Since they don't include a hard-copy target, you have to go to another source to calibrate your scanner. Their tweaking controls are only good if you already paid $$$ to calibrate your monitor.In my case, I bought the Spyder2 for the monitor, downloaded shareware to calibrate the scanner, and purchased a Kodak target to calibrate my scanner. After all that, my printer color is still not close. Finally, the documentation is very limited for a process this complicated.I was looking for something that would give me perfect color in only one process. This isn't it."
1,Poor Quality,"The laminated plywood on this game is nice and thick, but the hinges and hardware that is used is garbage. I took this out of the box and it was already needing to have screws tightened. Unfortunately, things did not get better from there - after about 5 games I had screws popping out of the wood entirely. I wish I could say that I ran this thing over with my car or used it as a bike ramp, but that is not the case. Pass on this item folks - you'd be better building one on your own for what would probably amount to less than $50 total."
5,"Analytical, unbiased, but fun look at Christina","I'm so glad I chose this book when I was looking for a book about Christina Aguilera. It was informative, intelligent and easy to read. I enjoyed the whole book from cover to cover. If you want to get a good idea of what Christina's like, this is the book to read. I love Christina and I admire her for all the struggles she went through to get to the top. This book is the best!"
3,Lots of info - Pretty good,"Has lots of information about song releases and dates etc. Lots of quotes by Christina also.Goes into quite a lot of depth in some places that maybe didn't need to, but otherwise is an easy read.He did a good job showing fans how Christina's career started and the good and bad things that happened to her along the way.I have no problems reccomending this book. It's a good guide to Christina, just a shame it wasn't authourised by her."
5,Best Christina Bio!,"This is a great Christina autobiography! It's up to date, informative & entertaining. Me, being a huge fan, I had to get it & I'm glad I did. She went from teen sensation to pop music icon with her phenomenal vocals, flamboyant fahsions, sassy attitude & impressive performance skills. This is the Dirrty Diva's story!"
1,Christina Aguilera: A Star is Made,"I recommend the writer of this book for future readings but, I do not like the books ""Christina Aguilera: A Star is Made,"" the singer is good but hearing the life story of the same singer everywhere gets tiring. I hope this review helped."
5,Movie Synopsis,"Synopsis: Along with his newfound allies, Hakuoro clashes with evil tyrants who challenge his very existence. As these despots attempt to destroy all that he holds dear, the masked one realizes this anarchy cannot - must not - continue. He digs deep into his steely resolve to return his people to peace. Nevertheless, as one army of fiends is dispatched, another is spawned from the depths in its place. Still one question looms ominous, but unspoken. What is the meaning behind the mask? Perhaps, it endows Hakuoro with the clarity of truth to do what is right. Maybe it allows him to keep his distance from a world where he is essentially an interloper. Or could it possibly hold the secret to his past that only his savior, Tuskuru, knew of before her demise? Find out for yourself in these five epic tales of Utawarerumono."
2,Fun Game for Younger Gamers,"Unfortunately, Muppets: On With The Show offers very little beyond good looking sprites. The six mini-games are great at capturing that Muppet feel, but they don't do anything with it. Each mini-game only lasts about 3-4 minutes, but do you really want to bash rats on the head witha frying pan for that long? And after you do it what's next? How about pushing the A or B button for 3-4 minutes in time to music? The Payoff? A Heckle from Statler and Waldorf. Hardly something I want to work towards. If these mini-games were part of a larger adventure they'd be enjoyable, but as the main dish, they're just unappetizing. A lot more substance and variety is needed.Younger gamers (ages 4-7) will probaly enjoy this game quite a bit since it has easy controls, is repettitive and the characters are appealing. But any long time Muppet fan will be sorely disappointed with this offering. Hopefully, they'll gett it right next time."
4,Muppets rule but this game drools ...,I Love the Muppets ! And I thought my neice who is 4 might enjoy playing this game since she usually plays my GBA when I come over to visit. I played this game and found it fun and funny at first but after finishing the game in less than an hour. I found it boring bcuz all the levels just repeat itself just at a fast pace. I agree with all the previous reviews that this game is definitely more suited for younger gamers like 3-7 yrs. old. I wouldn't say I regret purchasing this game but it's a game that I would probably consider trading in for money to buy something better. Only thing that I don't regret about buying this game is when I purchased the game there was a table full of games and accessories where when I bought this game I got to pick something off the table of equal or lesser value for FREE. I bought this Muppets game and got a Free Gamecube game to boot so that's the only thing that makes this worthy.
1,Poor Quality!,"My daughter and I are very disappointed with this video. The feet instructions are very vague during the 2nd and 3rd dances. For the 2nd dance, she shows us the arm movements from right to left, but when it's time to perform the dance, the kids are doing the dance from left to right! She does give us a brief foot instruction before the 2nd dance, but you are supposed to sit during the routine.The instructor is pleasant and the kids are cute, but the film quality is very poor. It looks like a cheap home video. The tape is also very short. It is highly over-priced."
5,Fantastic!,"I ""found"" this VHS tape at a thrift store for only 99 cents!!! Is it ever a treasure; my 4 year old students and I LOVED it! We did a small presentation for the parents and they were so proud of their kids. I only wish I could purchase this on DVD."
3,Spot Gel,"I ordered this, hoping it would work like the Proactiv version, but though it stings, I have not seen any noticeable improvements when used, even overnight. However, with skin care products, much depends on the type of skin you have, and mine is oily and acne-prone, so this might work for those with normal skin, or with occasional, mild breakouts."
3,The jury is still out.,Since I received the product I had one pimple that I was able to use the product on. It did not magically make the pimple go away. As a matter of fact I didnt notice any reduction in time from the clearing of the pimple. The jury is out because next time I will have to ensure that I apply the gel immediately upon realizing the onset of a possible pimple.
2,Leaks,I cancelled my subscription for these diapers. I will defiantly be calling Kimberly Clark for a refund. These diapers have done nothing but leaked all over for us. I will not be buying Huggies again. Hugflex = leaks. I am sticking with Pampers for good.
1,very poor diaper,"it is very poor in quality, hard and lump in the diaper. so i have to return the rest of them back to amazon. but still now i have not get my credit back."
1,Watch out for the system requirements,"Be sure to double check the system requirements using the Viva Media web site before you buy!The 1.0 version had a bug where it would not start even though it installed properly, for which the developer issued a patch.This version (1.5) has the same problem, but NO PATCH is available. When I emailed Viva Media about the situation, they responded that I didn't have enough graphics memory. Too bad those requirements are NOT spelled out in the Amazon listing!Buyer beware!"
5,Fantastic for everyone,"This is a great program - my 13 year old loves it, and it came in very handy earlier this year when my child had to create a Rube Goldberg device for science class."
3,Not as easy as it led to believe,"I read the reviews for this in November, and thought it would be great for my 8 1/2 and almost 7 year old boys. They tried it out for a couple of hours, and became frustrated. The packaging did not come with any explicit instructions on how to approach the activities.It took me a couple of tries to figure out what to do, and then explain it to my sons. Maybe I can get them back on it after things calm down a bit from all of the Christmas excitement and we can figure it out."
5,Life Changing,"Carol and Joan have put together a process for personal and spiritual growth that has been life-changing for me. They have masterfully woven their life stories into a re-usable process that will work for any woman. The book is practical and easy to follow. I have now completed the process myself 2 times and have led others through it 4 times. As a result I am a better wife, mother, friend and businesswoman and my love for God has grown exponentially. This is a must-read for any woman who desires to live proactively instead of being controlled by circumstances."
5,Must Read!!!!!,"An absolutely wonderful book. Brings Uncle Sean, Lance, and All Over Him together into one volume. Donaghe's interludes introducing and concluding each work ties everything together masterfully and is an added bonus readers won't get when reading the three works individually. The author makes you almost believe you're reading Will Barnett's biography/autibiography and not a work of fiction.Even though it's set in the '70s and may at times seem dated, this work is actually timeless and should be a must read for any gay teen/young adult.Let's only hope the author continues the series."
4,"Filter's fine, had to trim to fit into filter box on truck","This is the right filter for my 2002 Tacoma, 4x4, 3.4L v6, 4-door truck. I do a lot of driving in very dusty conditions and change the filter frequently.Only problem was the plastic frame was about 1/8 inch too large (flanges on the sides) and I had to cut them down to get it to fit properly in the filter box. Since buying two filters from Amazion, I've bought older versions of the filter as distributor close-outs from Rock Auto. The older versions fit fine, so Fram must have changed the the plastic frame sometime in the past couple years, making it a little too wide for the Tacoma, unless you cut it down.Price is good compared to what I can find in Hawaii, and Amazon ships for free, so cutting them down with my bandsaw is a small price to pay."
5,Does the job!,"How excited and you really get about a part that is hidden in an airbox and then covered by a hood? (If you say ""Super-excited"" you are a weirdo and should probably get help). For the rest of us I'll say that this seems to work just fine. It dropped right into the airbox of my '98 4Runner and fit perfectly. It was no hassle and less expensive than having the dealer or a quick lube place change it.Air filters do an important job and if yours is dirty you shouldn't skimp. Replace it for a better running engine."
5,THe Open Bible Shines,"I bought my first bible at Half-Price Books in Houston in 1985 for $3.50, well before I became a Christian. The bible was The Open Bible NKJV Study Edition by Thomas Nelson. I believe this book gave me the foundational concepts I needed to understand Chistianity. Over the succeeding years, I've bought many bibles but I have to say, I keep going back to The Open Bible because of the wealth of notes before each chapter and the many helps in understanding bible passages. It really shines and should be a part of any Christian's library."
2,long winded with no pay-off,"This book isn't even a good story. I can't recommend it to anyone except die hard McFarland fans. I was halfway through the book still wondering when something interesting would happen. Unfortunately, it ever really does. I would rather go to a nursing home and listen to the ramblings of a real person with their memories and dreams than read this made up drivel. Please find a new genre Dennis."
3,A mixed bag,"This collection of writing prompts has some excellent features. Prompts are organized into three modes of writing: Narrative, expository, and persuasive. Sample responses at various score points are given for several prompts in each section. Many of the prompts are compelling and accessible to students across a variety of writing levels.As one might expect from a collection of over five hundred writing prompts, there are also a great many that miss the mark for one reason or another. There's enough here, though, to complement any writing program."
3,A Usefull Writing Tool,"I teach writing to home school kids and have been surprised by what inspires them to write-- HINT: it's not the standard ideas found in most text books. 501 Writing Prompts has a wide variety of topics for writing and includes ""how to score"" information for each essay category. This book would help students practice for the essay portion of the SAT or other standardized test. If you're looking for something to teach you ABOUT writing, or HOW TO write, this isn't it. It is simply a thorough collection of ideas to spark a student's writing. (Examples of good, mediocre, and poorly written essays are included for several of the topics.)"
4,501 Writing Prompts,"This book has many suggestions for writing prompts for Persuasive, Narrative and Expository writing. A great tool to use quickly."
2,Skip This One,"This book talks about insulation, space, and mass and the needto ""tune"" a house to benefit from free heat/cooling. HOWEVER,it never mentions a single tuning formula. Unless you plan onbuilding many homes to ""tune"" your designs, this is only a bookon common sense and you'ld be better off with Reynolds' otherbooks or another book on this topic by another author."
4,A few things you should know about 'Mr. Bounce',"'Mr. Bounce' is either a short but entertaining picture book, or alternately a metaphor for the artist whose visionary nature makes it hard for him to fit in with the world around him. Mr. Bounce, disturbed by constant uncontrolled bouncing, goes to a doctor (representing the bourgeois rationalist mindset) who gives him a heavy pair of boots to stop him bouncing. But the boots lead to his downfall as an artist - they are so heavy that he crashes through the floorboards.Conclusion: artists should never listen to the advice of the rationalist types who seek to restrain their spirit. It's better to bounce unpredictably than crash through the floor like a ball of lead. But better still is the artist who has learned to CONTROL his bouncing, like Goethe, and that is what Mr. Bounce should have tried to do. Sadly, he chose to listen to a two-bit doctor instead.You may also enjoyTime Struggle 1: The Wolves of Odin (Volume 1)."
5,He Defeats The Laws of Physics,"Yet...he lives to tell about it. This is Mr. Bounce. He is no Mr. Tickle. He does not CRAVE social interaction. He does not demand that the small world of the Mr. Men bow down to his whims. NO, Mr. Bounce is more ... manly than that.The vigor of his physical nature is matched by his personal resilience, he is always willing to carry on, even though he must bounce unexpectedly.""Unexpectedly, you say? How can that be unexpected? His name is Mr. Bounce!""I'll tell you how it is UNEXPECTED! Mr. Bounce can bounce off ANYTHING! Even unbouncable products. Nothing can contain him, yet something does! His own sense of propriety, perhaps? His own limitations that being able to break the laws of physics does not allow one to break social laws?Mr. Bounce is the Jane Austen character we have been dreaming of for children ages 4-8."
4,"Good ""alternate"" cleanser","I have found this product is most effective when it's alternated with other cleansers. (Try Neutrogena's Clear Pore Cleanser / Mask.) It is a bit difficult to rinse completely, as the beads are slightly larger than other masks. But it is gentle and does an effective job of cleansing the skin.I don't believe that it will eliminate blackheads on its own, but when used with other products in this same line, it is very good."
1,Blackheads? Right.,This did nothing about my blackheads. I followed the instructions and did everything like I said. It just didn't do anything.
1,Good guidance for college kids - not helpful for professiona,All the little tests are not helpful at all and very subjective...The book is not helpful in regards to how to and what to look out for when going independent - and starting one's own company is not the same as going independent as contractor .Probably tries to please too many different purposes and fails.

3,Interesting and hope to see more,"The chef conducts the whole show in ASL. I would have liked to see the recipe (measurements, etc) on the show. I hope there will be more shows produced."
4,Great replica. Very authentic.,"I have a collection of 1/18th scale Ferrari's by Burrago from the 80s. Got the urge to augment my collection with a more modern Ferrari and came across the F430 by Hot Wheels. I'm still lamenting the fact that Burrago doesn't appear to be in business anymore. The attention to detail was amazing for models priced under $2[...] at the time. But compared to the little Hot Wheels cars I grew up with, the F430 is very well built, with good details for the price. My only complaint is that the wheels don't turn much. Otherwise its a nice replica, and a good addition to my collection."
4,Comprehensive Collection of Stories,"The Best of it Happened in Hockey is a great collection of stories that span more than 150 years of the history of the game. I was very impressed with the variety of stories and I thought that McFarlane did a great job in making it a very well balanced book. There are some classic stories as well as rarely heard tales from all eras.The book itself was laid out nicely and was very easy to read. This is a great book for anyone who is interested in some of the finer details of hockey history such as myself. McFarlane doesn't have the world's finest story telling abilities, but he's still a guy you want on your bookshelf. Though he doesn't produce a story with as much color as a Don Cherry or a Stan Fischler, his collection of data more than makes up for his shortcomings.Overall, a superb book that any devote hockey fan will really fine interesting and entertaining."
5,Not a bad product in the bunch!,"We are fond of the Ecos brand because their products are plant-based, and you can get absolutely dye/scent free. I believe their scented versions are still natural/plant based. Further, the concentrated formulas mean less in transport costs (and free up water for other use), and less storage room required of our (very limited) closet space. They are one of the few companies that produce HE versions across the board. Support manufacturers like this one -- eco friendly without any sacrifice as a consumer."
1,Detergent does not work!,"We purchased Ecos detergent and used it for about a month. We eventually stopped using it when we realized it just wasn't cleaning our clothing.After washing with Ecos detergent, our clothing still looked and smelled like it hadn't been washed. Clothing even had an oily feeling. If anything, soiled clothing came out of the wash looking much as it had when it went in. Even simple stains were not removed without using some kind of additional detergent or cleaner. Essentially Ecos laundry detergent was a huge disappointment.As soon as we switched back to our normal ""name brand"" detergent, all the problems noted above went away. We will not purchase Ecos detergent again and recommend you avoid it as well."
2,Disappointing,"A disappointingly thin 'biography' that uses previously available information as its source material. To be fair, the book states that Sting was loathe to become involved and that consequently the content is based on previously published interview material, but several of Danny Quatrochi's candid pictures are included. Keen fans are unlikely to learn anything new from this book which covers the period up until Sting's first 'proper' solo shows at the Ritz in New York."
1,This Item IS NOT as ADVERTISED !!!,"This Item Is Not, Let Me Repeat ... IS NOT in COLOR !!!This Item is NOT as Advertised, But ...A Simple Compliation of the Same First 3 Episodes In Which We Always See & Are Usually Included In Every Other Compilation & Usually at a Much Better Price !!!I Got All Excited When I Saw This Add ...Thinking Wow, Here it Is & Is it Really in COLOR ???As I Had Just Seen What They Had Done with the Colorized Version of the Ole Tyrone Powers ""Mark of Zorro"", But ...This DVD IS NOT what Your Are Looking for if Your Looking for a COLORIZED Version !!!Don't Be Disappointed Too, Don't Buy This Cheap DVD !!!"
5,"A ""must"" for young families with environmental concerns.","In Infant Potty Training, Laurie Boucke provides today's parents with a gentle and primeval method of toilet training for their children, adapted to the standards, resources, and demands of contemporary living. Readers will learn how babies were potty trained before the invention of diapers, and how they are potty trained today in societies without diapers. Infant Potty Training is a well-written and presented, ""parent friendly"" instruction manual and a ""must"" for families with concerns of environmental protection blended with a desire for close family bonding and a healthy, hygienic, successfully toilet-trained child."
4,I would recommend it,"I own this book and used it a lot for my first child. It was useful and was working. We saw our infant responding to the ""cues"". For a determined mom, this would be great. It did make diaper changes sooo much easier!!!"
2,get other books first,"I got this book after losing my copy of The Diaper-Free Baby by Christine Gross-loh. It looked like it had more information and it might be useful to read another take on the subject. While it does have more info, it wasn't as practical and as encouraging as the first book I had. I often found the tone of Infant Potty Training somewhat daunting, and discouraging. I would NOT lend this one out to interested friends until the read the other book first, or were already doing some EC. I'll be reordering Diaper Free Baby just so I can lend it out again."
2,Not for the mainstream,"I liked the idea of getting a head start on potty training my new baby. After checking out this book, I felt like I would be better off just going with my own instincts. The approach in the book is definitely not for everyone - personally, I don't think having baby pee in the bathroom sink is an improvement over diapers. Nor do I want to have baby peeing in a potty all over the house....or on my feet. We set up a little potty next to the changing table in the bathroom. Baby uses it when he gets up from a nap, or when he's obviously ready for a poo. It works nicely without all the associated weirdness of holding a bowl under your baby while nursing and other such things suggested in the book."
2,Informative but not as practical,"It has a large section on how infant potty training is used all over the world, but it doesn't have as much PRACTICAL information as I need -- like the various sign babies use, how to really get started. It's very brief on info like that."
3,Reviews cited; not quoted.,"Reviews of novels are not quoted; only cited. Volumes are not cataloged in alphabetical order, for easy reference. You have to consult the index first--then use the number to hunt the page where your item of interest is to be found."
3,What the hell happened?,"Really, what the hell happened to the end of the book? I thought it was fairly interesting -- a very different concept, with a couple of suprises. True, I found the characters pretty unlikeable and the dialog stilted, but it was holding my attention. And then -- pfft. I am seriously annoyed. If the author was making some kind of point by his non-completion of the story, as was suggested by another reviewer, I missed it. To me, it smacks of arrogance and self-indulgence; ""Oh, YOU didn't get it?!?""I'll give the book a three for concept, although I'd really like to deduct two just out of irritation!"
1,Underwhelmed,"I have read over 2,200 SF novels in my life thus I claim some degree of expertise in this arena. This novel has potential but lacks depth and brevity. It moves slow with an over abundance of character build up. However, it does drive you to continue. The failing of this novel is in its non-plausable science and abrupt ending that leaves the reader asking the question of..........."
1,Some books posted for sale but actually not available.,"Was so excited when I finally found this book (Eighteenth-Century French Fashions in Full Color by Stella Blum). I completed the transaction and then 2-3 days later I received an email from Amazon stating that my credit card had been credited for this book purchase but did not explain why. Confused, I sent the seller an email asking what had happened and they stated that this book was actually not available. About a week later, I saw the same book from the same seller listed for sale but again, it was not available. At least I received a credit for the purchase price but it was disappointing that the book was not actually available..."
3,NON THEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE,"This exhaustive work certainly has the facts. The problem is that the author's perspective - evidently in an effort to be objective - is that of a sociologist or historian of religion, as opposed to a Christian theologian. For example, dates are given in the ""BCE"" and ""CE"" nomenclature lately promoted by non-Christians.Would St Paul have written this way?"
3,For early readers...,"This book is for early readers, and is a good book to give your child the confidence to try more books. There are 26 words in this book, many repeated throughout. After one or two times reading this, a child will easily memorize it and lose some of the value as a reading tool. Though this is a good book for a new reader, it will quickly lose it's value after one or two reads. This is an excellent library book, for this reason. Quick and simple is the only way to define this book. No storyline, but a clear message of every face is special, especially that of the reader."
3,Not what I expected.,"I am trying to help my autistic son learn the names of the parts of the face, and I was hoping this book would help. However, that's not what this book is about. It is more a pro-diversity, ""feel good"" book about how each face is special. Of course, I hasten to add, there's nothing WRONG with that . . . just not what I expected. Very short and very simple vocabulary - probably good for beginning readers."
2,Not my glass slipper,"It seems that with Little, Big, one either loves the story (the majority) or is bored to tears by it. I confess I was of the latter class. Little, Big dragged so much in spots with its apparent aimlessness that I found myself thinking that I preferred even Dickens' writing. This rather massive novel is fairly episodic, centering on certain memories of the eccentric people, or their stories; I found the lack of a central theme until the end very irritating. Yes, lovely allusions and interesting eccentric characters and house, but-- surely a stronger central plot isn't too much to ask? What I thought would be a whimsical and delightful fantasy turned out to just be monotonous. I think I'll go back to reading Stardust or The Princess Bride, thanks."
5,Deserves 25 Stars,I read a lot of fantasy & sci-fi and this is w/o question my favorite book ever. A must read.
5,Nothing Else Comes Close,"""little, big"" by John Crowley may be the best book I have ever read. I routinely reccomend it to friends who show any interest in reading something deeper than a Tom Clancey novel, but without much hope, since ""little, big"" is basically almost too good to be true. The use of language in this book is so lyrical, so beautiful that words fail me. In fact, words fail me in most respects when trying to do justice to this book--one runs out of superlatives. The characters are three-dimensional and well-drawn, the plot is quirky and fascinating, the exposition is wonderful. It defies classification in the way that truly great art sometimes does; it's not really fantasy, but then it is, isn't it?. It has more in common with ""In the House of the Spirits"" by Isabel Allende than it does with ""The Hobbit."" When I become dictator of the world, everyone will have to read this book; then they'll see what a truly wise, benevolent dictator I am."
5,A Portrait Of Our Lost Spiritual Legacy,"Forget the usual trappings of fantasy, this is a modern masterpiece centering on two of the greatest themes in world literature: faith and remembrance. It is a story of one family's messy struggle to retain wonder, fidelity and a type of ancient, earthy consciousness as the shadow of a cold, sterile modernity creeps over their world. The Drinkwaters' resistance is both resoundingly heroic and deeply tragic. The passage of time eventually disorients the younger generations of the family, whose members must find a way to believe in something they each knew instinctively as children but that becomes less vivid and more difficult to remember as they (and the family's history) grow. In a very real sense, it is the story of all our lives and Crowley is a master Sorcerer to have conjured up a Tale that serves us so well. This book is a wonder."
5,Elf?,"It's like reading grain alcohol. Astonishing.Plus, when all is said and done it's a love story with a happy ending."
1,Just couldn't hold my attention,"Set in modern times, this book tries to be mysterious and magical by being vague and suggestive. However, it only succeeds and being confusing, slow, and boring. I quit reading half-way through because I kept drifting off and forgetting what had happened. The writing just couldn't hold my attention to make it worth it."
2,I'd rather watch Bewitched reruns,"We picked this book for our book group based largely on Harold Bloom raving about it. Harold and I obviously have different taste in books. I slogged through the book and managed to finish it, but I did not enjoy it.I notice that the small number of folks who gave the book lower ratings feel like they have to apologize and admit to some lack of intellect. This might have been a good short story, but it was a hellish 500 page book. And I'm not kidding that I'm much rather watch Bewitched reruns - Samantha, Darren, Tabitha and Endora are way more interesting than any of the characters in this book."
2,A little annoying,"I just started to read the Book. So far I eke out to page 86. The Story itself is interesting and that is the only reason I decided to continue.After 60 Pages I started first time to count the iteration of the word ""though"". It seems to be the Author`s favorite and at some pages I could find it up to four times.I am very sorry but this uninspired writing is nothing else but annoying and for a foreigner who`s mother-tongue is not english and who wants to read books not last for practice, to my opinion it is not the best choice."
2,Whewww! Not For Me . . .,"A friend of mine, who is an avid reader of many types of literature like me, highly recommended this book. I made it about fifty pages before the confusion, depression, and disinterest forced me to cast it aside. The book just made me disoriented and tired."
1,pretty bad,"I really hated this book. It was so dreary, confusing and boring. I'm willing to put up with a lot of book with little action (and often enjoy such books), but this one just didnt make any sense! The plot, if you can call it that, was so disjointed and rambling and unclear. I was very dissapointed because I read many reviews before purchasing this book, and it was so well reviewed I thought I'd like it. I guess I didn't realize how much I appreciate clearness and plot in a book."
2,Not Free SF Reader,"I started this, but absolutely not my thing. The writing would seem to be ok, but at several hundred pages of what was going on here, no thanks. This particular Fantasy Masterworks edition had the incredibly annoying and twee indentations of different scenes time after time. That destroys any reading flow, at all."
2,"I'm Really Sorry,","I tried to read and love this book several times , and I have a degree from Columbia in Literature and I read a lot of Fantasy but I just can't get into this book!Nothing HAPPENS! It just goes on and on and I can't like or identify with or wish to live vicariously through anybody!Isn't that what the Fantasy genre is supposed to be about?"
3,frustrated!,"what good is a book if you can't get the cover open and get to page one? the glue is wrong or something, and it's all twisted around like a little weiner package. i am very frustrated!"
3,Beautiful Writing but S-L-O-O-O-O-O-O-W-W-W...,"Maybe I'm not as patient as I used to be - but I've read Proust and liked it! Crowley's stories tend to be wandering walkabouts through worlds of words, with eccentric characters pursuing the possibilities inherent in a variety of intriguing conceits... but plot - hey, who needs it? I guess _I_ do! I find John Irving does a more coherent job of these dense, multi-character tomes. It was a SERIOUS effort to finish this book. There are some interesting ideas and Crowley is a poet of prose, but the eccentric-character bit only takes you so far. I'd strongly recommend his short story, Engine_Summer. Save Little,_Big for one of those times you're stuck on a desert island with nothing else to read."
2,"Apparently, I Just Don't Understand","There's no question that Crowley has a good grip on language. But honestly, I can't understand all the rave reviews for this book. The main characters are, to me, completely uninvolving and uninteresting cyphers. There is no plot that I was able to detect. And worst of all, the overall feeling of constant whimsey I found to be oppressive and cloying. If one wants whimsey in reasonable doses, I would recommend ""Neverwhere"" by Neil Gaiman, a book that, in my opinion, has some of the same elements that many reviewers seem to enjoy, without the overwhelming cloyingness that made this book a chore for me.Obviously, the mileage of others varies considerably, but I found this to be a long, uninvolving book whose atmosphere is opressive."
4,Not quite...,"I came to this book with high hopes because Crowley's ""Engine Summer"" was one of my favorite stories. And for the most part, I was not disappointed. The writing is careful and conveys both mystery and deep feeling. I cared about the characters and their family relationships. The fairy dimension to the story is, I think, well served by being kept in the background.My disappointments: I watched young Auberon drag himself through the gutter for what seemed like an awfully long time without much happening. And at the end, far too much was left hanging. I don't need to have everything spelled out, but, (spoiler here) for example, there were several references to a war in the fairy world, and at the end, no sign that it ever happened."
3,Dream-Like State,"This book is fascinating in a dreamlike, fantasy way. What it lacks in actual plot it makes up for in originality. However it's so long that about halfway through one starts wishing for a little more action."
2,Interesting but flawed,"I will not attempt to write a professional review; too many have already done this. The book is mostly a fairy tale. The last third or so of the book is set in some sort of post meltdown England which manages to be less believeable than the fairytale. The book was written some decades ago when it may have gone down better. The first half of the book I found enjoyable and was thinking of all of the people that I'd like to share it with. Suddenly, the book switches gears to something resembling magical realism, and my enjoyment meter reversed direction. This book has held up far less well than ""The Forgotten Beasts of Eld"", ""Mythago Wood, and the New Sun books, of Gene Wolfe or Jack Vances' Lyonesse series. To end,I finally gave up on ""Little, Big"", and tossed it away. Read the first half and then lose it maybe, a plan?"
5,Dalliance with John Crowley,"Normally I plow through books, but with Little, Big, I was able to take my time. Reading on my Kindle was especially rewarding, as Crowley uses some archaic and esoteric vocabulary. Being able to look up the definitions was a pleasure. Little, Big is not a typical fantasy novel, relying instead on complex and often ambiguous relationships between people and the otherworld to move the story forward. Literary allusions abound, adding another layer of complexity to the onion-like tale. I highly recommend this book."
4,"Haunting, fantasy read - couldnt put it down","I loved the character development and the over all pacing of the book. It allowed me to be outside of the time of 2011 while reading it. What a pleasure. The written style was so clever, and daring at the same time."
4,"A magical, enchanting read","The farther I got into this book, the less I seemed to know. When it felt like I was finally figuring out what was happening, the book was ending. So after weeks of trying to read it faster to catch up with the plot, suddenly I wanted to read it slower, to prevent it from ending. Well, I can't really summarize this book - you've got to read it to experience this magical world of the fey. I'll probably wait a few years to forget it, and read it again - I'm sure it will be even better the second time around."
4,A strong showing from strong artists,"I really like this album. As much as I like Journey, it's nice to see Neal Schon show off some harder stuff. I'd never heard of Jeff Scott Soto before, but his strong voice also gives an edge to this album. Best tracks to listen to: Highest Ground, Friends 2 Lovers (not a wussy balad!), and Coming Home. There's not a song on the ablum I don't like, but those are my favorites."
3,"Strong playing, but songwriting is somewhat lacking","Being a huge fan of Jeff Scott Soto's recent solo release, ""Lost In The Translation"", hopes were high for a true knockout punch with the pairing of JSS with Neal Schon. Unfortunately, WORLD PLAY doesn't quite deliver.The issue lies not in the vocal performance (stellar), the musicianship (tight, rock solid, and high energy), but in the lack of truly memorable songs. Whereas ""Lost In The Translation"" and Journey albums in general all have strong hooks and choruses, WORLD PLAY doesn't.WORLD PLAY is an enjoyable album to listen to for fans of Neal Schon and JSS, but there are no real obvious standouts among the songs. Nothing will jump out and grab you like ""Soul Divine"" or ""All The Way"". SOUL SIRKUS has tremendous potential to be a huge band - work on the songwriting and the rest will follow."
4,Get rid of those ugly blackheads...,"This blackhead eliminating astringent really works, all you have to do is put some on a cotton ball and gently sweeps your face with it after you clean and dry your face (it helps cleaning off left over make up residues too). You probably want to pay more attention to the t-zone area since that's where all blackheads usually lies. Oh yeah, i only give it a 4 stars because i think this product is a bit strong. Sometimes you have to take times to adjust to it and use it carefully, but it does works nicely at cleaning out those dirty blackheads. (my sister in law and i loves this product, and we use it everyday, and we find ourselves liking it more and more, because we rarely see any blackheads and whiteheads...so try it, you might like it...)"
2,"Severe dryness, lotion doesn't help it, it's THAT bad.","Perhaps it's just me, but whenever I use toners or anything with alcohol in it, my face just tightens up and sunburns and everything gets inflamed and it's just horrible. I tried using several neutrogena astringents but all of them yielded either no changes, or worsened the condition of my skin.I wouldn't recommend this unless you have elephant skin."
3,my review,"umm. . hey guys, has anyone besides me kindda noticed that this doll looks like a prostitute? I mean, i like bratz and all and i usually think that Dana is really pretty. . . but the outfits and stuff looks pretty trasy, i dunno, maybe it's just me. . ."
5,BRATZ ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!,"okay this dana has by far been one of the greatest.i love her eye lashes,though you might want to buy this doll for a girl 7 or older, because she has lots of little jewelery,and stuff,anways I LOVE THIS DOLL!!!!!!!!!!I hope this helped you.sincerely,Karla"
5,A fantastic new addition to the Bratz line!,"By far, I think this is the best of the new Bratz 'Girls Night Out' line of dolls. Not only does this Dana come with real eyelashes, but her dress and second outfits are just soo cute! Like all Bratz things, Dana and all her goodies are really well-made. Sometimes a bit fiddly for little hands, so I don't recommend for children under 5. Lots of accessories are included! I love the fact that these dolls are dressy enough for the formal funk outfits too. No faults that I can find - just my usual gripe about how hard it is to get the doll and accessories out of the box to play with ;)"
2,good content but painful video and audio quality,There is some good content here but it's tough to get past the video and audio quality which is very low. There are better videos out there.
4,Not fragrance free,"I like this product. It goes on smoothly and makes my skin feel nourished. My only complaint is that it's not fragrance free. Dove makes a fragrance-free lotion for sensitive skin -- Dove Face Care Sensitive Essentials, Day Lotion - 120mL -- but that one doesn't have sunscreen. Why can't they make one that has both features?"
5,Wonderful lotion!,"This is really a nice product. It leaves my face smooth and soft without any break out! My only problem is the cap, it is a bit hard to open, otherwise this lotion is perfect for me."
1,Idiotic Concept: Scented Facial Lotions,If you use this product you will have to smell its sickening scent all day long. Enjoy.
4,"A well-drawn, suspenseful first novel.","Lopes Heald creates a vivid, detailed world, one with anagenda of its own. The characters are rich and evocative,and the interaction between Sal and Meesha constantlyintriguing. In all, a good solid read. Look for this authorin the future."
5,Loved the book. Read it several times. Where's the sequel?,This was a fun book to read with a great concept for the story's setting. I've been waiting (in vain) for the sequel or anything else by this author.
5,brutally thrashing,"I could not believe my eyes when we threw this video on,the behind the scene parts were erie,and morbid.The part where all four members of the group hung a sidated goat from the ceiling of a motel room in Canada,then quarterized its midsection,really got to me.When they threw the entrials at Marilyn Manson and he fainted,I thought was funny, though..."
4,Works great - just get used to fewer suds,"This product works fine for about every type of dish/pan cleaning. Many complain they have to use more or that it doesn't work well. What the issue really is that people are used to high-sudsing detergents so they use more to try to get more suds or they feel it's not working.The fact that it doesn't suds a lot is the point - it's what makes it environmentally friendly.Those of you on septic will really appreciate this cleaner as it better for the system and in combination with other similar products for your washer and dish washer, will reduce the problems detergents cause."
5,Outstanding,"I treid this Dishmate product when we had our first child, because it's non-toxic. Works like any other dishwashing product, buts smells much better - I want to drink it."
5,I want to join the Marilyn Paul fan club!,"I was merely looking for a book to help me get better organized, but I got so much more!! This book will not just make your sock drawer look better, it will help you to really look at yourself and why you do the things you do. There were times when I had to just put the book down and marvel in wonderment because she asked a question or made an observation that was so incredibly insightful, I was almost moved to tears."
1,Don't bother,"If you've taken Psych 101, don't bother. All mental stuff, nothing of actual value here."
1,The campaign for mathematical clarity starts here...,"These truths I hold to be self evident:1) It is unacceptable to provide equations without explaining all the symbols in them.2) If you explain something to an intelligent person and they still don't understand then it is your fault not theirs.3) Laziness is the right of the reader, not the author.In practice you assume your audience knows some things, ellide from previous equations for space and fluency, and provide a glossary. But I have a degree in maths (not stats) and still I can't make head or tail of the first two pages of chapter 2 in the excerpt given. So I will look for a book, article or course that assumes less knowledge on my part."
1,Learn about EM? Read the relevant papers but not this book,"I tried to read the whole introductive chapter a couple of times but I couldn't understand what is EM about, the used terminology and the basic definitions. The authors say that the book is for theoriticians and practicioners, but I do think it is not appropriate for both categories, unless the reader has been involved in writing papers on this topic. I have enough background knowledge in probability theory and in mathematics but it seems that I have to read all the relevant literature before going a step ahead. In my opinion this book is wide useless for people who do not know EM algorithm."
3,Mark Harmon as a Tuareg warrior?,"Okay, so this movie has Mark Harmon in it, it's really not that bad. Well, acting bad makeup and storyline aside, the scenery and costumes are really pretty great considering that the movie was made in '83 in Israel. It has a few rough spots where you might want to scratch your head and check to see if your couchmate is still alive, but it moves along quickly enough. If you like decapitations, bloody gunshot wounds, bloated camels and exploding Arabs you'll rewind this tape with satisfaction. If you're looking for a good documentary on the life of modern Tuareg... well, Mark Harmon is in this flick. The Tuareg definately deserve better treatment than this, but it's all that's out there."
4,This is not a peel-away mask,"If you're expecting this to be something to clean up your blackheads like a pore-strip, you'll have to look elsewhere. However, if you want something that lessons the appearance of a monthly outbreak, gives you that deep-clean feeling, and leaves your skin feeling soft - shop on!I love using this mask at night, before I go to bed. When I wake up in the morning, my skin feels so smooooooth! (Of course, you DO wash it off, but I have noticed the benefits of using this product are enhanced overnight.)The mask takes longer to dry than the recommeded 5 mins on the package. But it doesn't leave you feeling pulled or tight - just clean."
2,mask,The mask didn't exactly help much. Not any different than others I've tried.The seller was quick and reasonable.
3,Suddenly Sixty,"I like this author and thought it would be funnier, my fault I didn't notice it was all different poems."
4,Bought for my elderly parent and glad I did,I bought this for my mother who is 92 and she is enjoying the poems as I feed them to her one or two at a time. the sentiments are dead on.
5,SO TRUE,Viorst and I could be related. We really experience things in similar ways. Because I am a bit of an outlier -- she validates me!
5,Fun read,I have purchased many of this author's books. Judith Viorst writes wonderful short happenings for a person having a milestone birthday. Always a great gift!
1,Are You Kidding Me?,"Are you kidding me? $11.56 for the hardcover edition and $13.99 for Kindle edition. That's absolutely ridiculous!!!! Please people DO NOT pay these prices for electronic format. The elec. format has very little manufacturing and no distribution costs that printed books have and we should not have to pay these inflated prices that are almost pure profit. Please don't feed their greed! This is nothing against Judith Viorst, she's a wonderful author and I will probably go buy this book at a used book store. I realize this is not a review of the book BUT the word needs to get out that we won't tolerate these prices for e-books."
4,Don't Even Try to Guess What Will Happen Next,"In most of the Choose Your Own Adventure books you can base your decisions somewhat on logic. In this one, everything is backwards. In fact, you are usually better off ignoring the practical advice of your fellow members of the Zondo Quest Team. In a book that involves getting shrunken and encountering giant ants in an attempt to stop the Evil Power Master from destroying the universe, reason seems to falter. You can defeat the old arch-nemesis of the Zondo Quest team, but most likely you will at first get stuck in some colorful death scene or even start an aphid rebellion against ruthless ant taskmasters.If you want a Choose Your Own Adventure with sheer random fun, this is it. Anything can happen."
4,Nice,"I've used Strathmore drawing paper befor, still, I am just as impressed.This is the first with personal, 4in. x 6in. size sheets. The texture of the paperis still high quality, the size of the tablet, perfect! Nobody knows you are drawing!Get it??? No, posing!! thank you, Amazon for your recommendation and quick delivery.THANKS!"
4,art,My Grandson loved this. Now he can go in his room and draw whenever he wants to. I am thinking about getting him the poster board with the stand also.
5,sweet little drawing pad,"I bought this along with an eraser, a pencil set and a pencil sharpener to get myself back to drawing. I wanted this tiny 4x6 pad of paper so that I would not be overwhelmed with having to fill up a huge page with drawing. I love this little pad. It is the same paper as in the bigger pads just a smaller size. Perfect for keeping beside you for whenever inspiration hits."
2,frustrated,The paper is cream...not bright white.:( you need to put that in bold letters with the description) ...pretty disappointed ...
4,Nice Paper.,We purchased two of these for our 9 year old girl. Very nice paper in a sturdy pad. I love that it is designed for multiple mediums.
3,Itsa NIce :),It came perfectly on time and has very nice paper. The downside being its so expensive for so little. You get 24 pages for the price. It would just be easiear to go and get it in store rather than pay 15 dollars on something so small.
5,Excellent drawing paper,I use this type of paper for my drawing class. It is a very nice quality for the price that it's sold at.
2,good,this is good but I think its kind of pricey. and the price seems to go up and down but more up.
4,Great,Bought this for a friend and they love it. Great paper quailty. He likes the big size for larger pictures. Goes well with a drawling table.
3,Eh...,"This is one of my less-than-happy purchases on Amazon. Not that the paper quality is poor, but there were only 20-some pages in it. Word of advice: pay a little bit more money for a lot more paper. A guy in my art class had one with 100+ pages and paid like $5 more for this product. Seemed like a waste to me."
4,drawing pad,"Decent paper.Arrived undamaged, packaged nicely.Could have had more pages.Didn't handle pastels very well."
3,"nice pad, small though","This pad looks bigger than it is, I suppose I should have paid more attention to the actual measurements, lesson learned."
4,CHRISTmas gift,Ordered along with an art set and other sketch pad for an 8 year old aspiring young artist! Hope he enjoys!
4,Good quality.,"I bought this for my daughter who is an budding artist and the quality is great, the same I would get at AC Moore. The packaging kept it in great condition. 4 stars not 5, because, well, it's just paper. I was able to get free shipping and the pricing was the same or better than going to the store."
1,Not worth the price,"The price was 3.49 per tablet, but by the time I paid shipping, I ended up paying around $6.00 per tablet. Plus, the edges were dog earred from shipping. Definitely NOT worth it."
1,Dissatisfied,The postage cost more than the art work. Ridiculous! I thought it would be easy to order my Christmas gifts on line to save time--it saved time but cost me more in shipping. The postage should not have been more than a dollar. it Was Just A Tablet For Drawing!!!
1,Bad Sellers,"When items (new) were refused and sent back to the seller, they refunded $0.66 of the total. How does that work? I would never buy from them again."
4,You had to be there...,"I used to go see this rock and roll band you've never heard of when they played my Middle Tennessee college town. Although none of them would ever remember me, I've actually met and spoken with them on a couple of different occasions. So, reading this book was like getting in on all the shows I missed. For me, it was a funny bit of nostalgia. For those of you who've never heard of Government Cheese or heard their music...well, that's a real shame."
1,Pathetically sluggish,"I read all the reviews and watched you-tube and was impressed, but then I received it just to find that out of all the reviews only one person got it right....Horrible! Sluggish unresponsive flight controls, bombs would not respond, If your mentally unstable this is the game for you, if you smoke allot of weed this is the game for you. However, if you have a fully active mind, this is not the game for you."
3,Aero Elite: Combat Academy,Video Game left a lot to be desired.Video Game arrived in a very timely fashion.Video Game arrived in excellent condition.
1,Horrible,"Modern fighter jets that fly like they're pulling a B-52 in tow. No power, unbelievably slow turns/sluggish maneuverability. An F-15 stalling while 5 degrees nose high with full power, nope! Go with the ace combat series if you want to fly jets. If you like WWII planes...Secret Weapons Over Normandy is great."
3,Check your appplication and FSM,I bought this harness to connect a aftermarket head unit to my 2001 Nissan Sentra SE with stock premium audio.I connected the wires as per instructions but the stereo did not power up. I looked up the wiring diagram from the Nissan Factory Service Manual and I compared the harness connections with the stock connectors and noticed that the ground wire on the harness was not in the right location.I had to open up one of the harness connectors to switch the pins/wires in the harness. But stereo worked after that.YYMV
3,Velbon Quick Release Plate,I was purchasing a quick release plate for one that was missing from my tripod. Unfortunately the size was not indicated so I was taking a chance on the item I ordered.
1,A total waste of time and paper,"Psycho babble and justification for her actions,or lack of them. Self published and reads like it...textual and spelling errors a plenty. Also it seems she has written most of the reviews here herself,which isnt surprizing since she is a master of self serving promotion for herself. This person is trying to profit from the death of a supposed love one...dont allow this to continue by buying this book...instead spend some quality time with your own loved ones and leave this poor deluded 'author' to her self grandizing."
4,"Perfect for PreK, not great for Kindergarten",This was on an amazing sale on Amazon (thanks!) and I bought it for my Kindergarten classroom. My students were initially engaged but have bored of it after a few months. I have also taught PreK and this would be ideal for a PreK classroom.
1,Worst rock album in years,"Get new material, its stale and stagnant. Get a new guitarist, I could play these songs when I was in middle school. Avoid this band."
1,"Garbage, throw it in the trash","Repetitive guitar playing, the drummer is alright but not that great. The lyrics are dull and unispiring, and the singer of this band needs to take some singing lessons. They are missing a key ingredient to a good band: MUSICAL TALENT. Dont buy their other albums"
3,Love At First Sight,"There is no doubt that Dionne Warwick has a magnificent voice. From the 1960s to today, her smooth R&B vocals have remained a factor on the airwaves of both AM and FM radio. From Warner Brothers Records, the 1977 release of Love At First Sight is no less a wonderful portrayal of the power of those vocals. Though it did not yield any significant hits, Love At First Sight does offer a ""lost gem"" in the East Coast Beach Music scene in track #10 ""Do You Believe In Love At First Sight."" Hard to find in most venues, this one song is worth the price alone."
3,Not the best she has done.,"I have all the Warner catalogue material as well as the best of the Scepter & Arista material and I have to say that thismaterial is not the best. The production, backing musicians and Dionne's performance are very good as usual but the material lets her down. There are no memorable songs."
1,kinda deceptive,"the title says ""foot pegs"" - plural. I received one. Also, the product image shows the aluminum piece + bolt that mounts to the bike. those were not included. Basically, the black aluminum piece is all you get, and you get one."
4,Great Invention,Being seniors we appreciate not having to stoop & scoop. Our yard benefits and so do we. The only thing is if the grass is too long scooping can be tricky. Very simple one handed operation.
4,Good Choice for Natural Foot Care,"This book offers tips and home treatments for individuals seeking natural health care options. As a podiatrist and author of Those Aching Feet, I can say that this book has many helpful and safe tips. If you are looking for in depth information and treatment options for specific foot problems this book is not for you. But, if you want simple, basic, cheap and easy solutions for common foot problems, I would recommend this book."
3,How to Say it Best,Book arrived on schedule in good condition. I thought it was new and it was used with yellow highlights. At least they could have taken off the yellow stickers (that were marking someones thoughts) on the pages.
4,Used for wedding,We were looking for something that was very classy but still a good quality. These worked out great! I look forward to using them in the future!
1,horrible...the handles swivel when you are cutting things,The handles swivel when you are cutting cakes .... very difficult to handle!!!! buy another set !!!!!! !!!!!! !!!!! !!!!! I will be buying another set as a gift.
5,Exceptional Product,"i couldn't have been more pleased. it was perfect, no scratches or anything and whats more, i got it in great time for the wedding. i was actually going to pay $50+ for this same set in Macy's but thank God i didn't!"
1,Just not as good as I thought it would be,"This book seemed to have taken some stories from other books and meshed it in to one for a profit. Although he tried, I'd have to suggest to this author not to really write again. It's almost like reading a children's book, with it's bland and non-descriptive sentences. Sorry bud."
3,Completion,I am glad Nita was able to get Connor to see he was not happy and he was angered because of it. I am also happy he made her see that she was the marrying kind. Excellent book!
4,Great Starter guitar,"The shipping was very fast. Unfortunately the guitar we got was broken at the neck of the guitar. the good news, the customer servie at Austin Bazzar were awesome. Once I sent them proof of the damaged guitar, they quickly sent me a UPS tag to return the item and it was replace within days. Very happy with the guitat for the price. Good starter guitar for kids that may not want to take it too serious and not learn. Very inexpensive for starters. The amp sounds pretty good for its size."
1,wouldn't buy it again,Nice concept but speed of cuisinart motor makes it uncomfortable and not particularly useful. I prefer my normal speed juicer.
1,They put a sticker on top of their label and heres what I found under the sticker,"as of 60mg of 20:1 extract - These manufacturers will make claims like 1200 mg of Hoodia Gordonii (as 60 mg of 20:1 extract) when in reality, you are purchasing 60 mg of Hoodia Gordonii. I should have known that the two reviews were sales people - it reads like a sales pitch not a customer. It either works or it doesn't and this does not. And I found out information that I did not know all of these years of buying Hoodia.No one is selling Hoodia Gordonii extract , as it would be violating the patent held by CSIR (which has been leased to Phytopharm, who in turn have leased it to Unilever). Any company claiming to sell a Hoodia extract had better watch their step - apart from misleading consumers, Phytopharm and Unilever are unlikely to ignore such blatant patent theft."
4,"Mastering Digital Scanning with Slides, Film & Transparencies","Excellent text and tons of infromation, too much for the casual user. For someone serious about scanning from film media it's excellent. Someone wanting to scan objects or photos should find another source."
2,Mastering is a misleading title for this book,"If you know nothing about scanning slides, film, or transparencies, then this book may be of some help in introducing terminology and some techniques. Or if you are a purely artistic photographer, with no computer facility, then this book can help.However, if you have done some scanning and understand the basics, then there is likely to be little here of value. The book has a lot of pages and is well organized, but each chapter falls well short of providing the in-depth knowledge required for mastery, despite the cutesie congratulatory message at the end of each chapter. If you have an analytical or engineering mindset, and wish to learn useful details of the scanning process, then save your money, this book is not for you."
3,Too rustic birdhouse wind chime,"Bought this and the perched bird wind chime at the same time. This is not constructed nearly as well. The birdhouse is a little too quaint and rustic for my taste and will not hold up well in our Midwestern weather. The description given was a little vague as to what the birdhouse was made of and I hoped it was metal like the perched bird chime was. Before I put it out, I will need to sand and seal the wood or it will crack in no time at all. It is a nice size and the sound of the chimes is very pleasant though."
2,"Good Movie, awfull DVD","Being a huge Kate jackson fan, I just could not miss this one. The movie itself is pretty good, Kate's performance is brilliant, and the rest of the cast do a good job too. But I am so disapointed with the quality of the DVD,it is just awfull, even a old vhs would be better !! It is just a shame to sell a DVD with such poor quality, the sound is terrible and the image is even worth !! 5 stars for the movie, 0 for the quality (only because you can not give negative rates !!)"
2,Great Movie--Terrible Quality DVD,"I love Kate Jackson and Robert Wagner, and I love this movie. I was so happy when I found it on DVD, but the quality of the DVD is the poorest I have ever seen. It is a poor quality DVD copy of a poor quality copy of a SLP VHS tape. The quality of the DVD was so bad that my portable DVD player could not recogize the disc to play it. The film is grainy and poor. The sound is almost inaudible and of poor quality--I had to put all of my speakers on high in order to hear it. I am glad I spent less than $5, inlculding S&H. It is worse than the Korean DVD I bought of ""Windmills of the Gods"" with Robert Wagner. In comparison, that DVD is great! I will keep this DVD because it would cost me more pain and money to send it back than it is worth. No wonder the Studio that made the DVD is called ""Cheezyflicks."" The name is not for the movies! I have to agree with another reviewer--5 Stars for the movie; 0 Stars for the DVD quality!"
3,Seen this before.......,"Ive seen this tv movie in the late 70s and I kinda enjoy this film. Kate Jackson is always enjoyable to watch and of course, Bob Wagner is a fave, as always.However, when I received the dvd I've ordered, it's a different film inside. The cover is right but what's inside the disc in something like ""Yellow Canary.""Hope there's more quality control because this happens quite a lot lately...."
2,Pretty.but...,"The watch is very pretty. But the day is hard to set. After setting it the first time I have not been able to change it. Date and time are easy enough to change. If the watch is not worn every day, it stops running. I understand that movement keeps it running but resetting the day ...Oh well. Also I had had the watch for two weeks and one of the crystal had fallen out. This tells me it may be too delicate to wear everyday. Live and learn."
4,u use SQL? u better read this!,"If you do anything with SQL and need top secure it, please read this book.Securing SQL is not rocket science, but it is easy to do wrong.This book shows how to do it right."
4,Life Lessons,I have a phone bible study and this book works very well for the audience that I have. I like the questions and the reflections.
2,Book of Acts,"Bought this as a guide for a Womens Bible Study...after about two chapters, they decided that they did not like the format so we went directly to the word..the questions at the end of chapter were not a hit.."
5,Wonderful and Truely Inspirational,"Even though Max is always great in the way he rights about God and God's love, I was amazed by this series. It really is helpful to new christians and really deals with our day to day issues. He includes segments of inspiration from his other books which pertain to the perticular lesson. I recommend this book to everyone, even to you!"
3,no memory cards included?,These may come with a CD case and no memory card. This was my experience. This is just like the one that Target sells. Check with the seller before you order.
2,Gym reading,"I love a good fantasy novel: I love Robert Jordan and recently I have fallen in love with Harry Potter. I cannot say the same for the Wolf of Winter: I thought this book was mediocre at best. I read it to pass time while I was on the bike at the gym. It is suited to that purpose: it lasted quite a long while because I never felt a real urge to continue reading the book outside the gym. In a world where there are so many classics that I haven't had the time to read and so many fantastic adventure stories that are thrilling from cover to cover, I would not spend my time reading this book unless I had it lying around and wanted to read something light at the gym."
2,LOVE the scent...but,"archipelago candles makes some of the best smelling candles i've ever smelled... i love pacifica, enfluerage, mediteranea, savannah... and this light green one that has fig - sorry can't remember the name. BUT these candles smoke A LOT and they put off enormous amounts of soot. I started experiencing sinus headaches and sore throats after i started using these candles. it took me several weeks to realize that my aliments were from the use of these candles. (how did i know it was the candles? i blew my nose and the snot was black- and i had been inside all day long) i think these candles smell fabulous- however i will no longer burn them. which is a shame since i spent $200 on the collection i purchased."
2,Overpowering perfumey smell,"I have other candles from Archipelago which I like, but Pacifica's scent was much too strong and flowery for me. I was expecting a refreshing, beachy kind of scent, and this isn't that at all. It reminds me of certain brands of fabric softener sheets. Much too strong-smelling (it overpowers the room) and perfumey for me. Pretty candle, though."
1,Horribly pixilated,"While the paper quality appears to be good, the image looks horrific. It is so pixilated it appears as though someone took a 3X5 and simply enlarged the image to 18X24. If I stand at the back of the room and take my glasses off, only then does the image look anything like what is shown here on Amazon.com. If this were a $5 poster, I would suspect it came from somebody who setup shop in their garage. For this money, it will be going back.So disappointed too. I had the perfect place to put it."
2,It's not the interview in it's entirety,"This is not the interview it it's entirety, it skipped like and entire 10-15 minutes. I saw the interview in it's entirety on 60 minutes website. It' sucks. . . ."
5,Hat - Gangster White,I actually bought black and white hats to use as centerpieces for a Birthday Party. They were a great hit and after the Party many of the guest were putting them on with the Boas and having pictures made. Awesome idea and very nice. They were not that expensive but had an expensive look to them.
1,Avoid.,"I bought this hat after reading the good reviews; it's for a 1920s themed party.It sucked.The hat came slightly dirty and obviously not new.It looked cheap and did not fit my head.Worst of all, it seemed to be made out of the same material that egg cartons are made of.I wanted to return it, but it isn't even worth the shipping costs."
3,White gangster hat,"This product is good for it purpose! But not what I thought it would be, but great price for what I received"
4,Night Court redux,"Well, Night Court is STILL a funny sit-com, from the 1980s. Harry Anderson, Dan Larroquette and the others could create different ways for the plots to be funny and (to a large degree) memorable .. in most episodes. .. One could even think-of Night Court as a follow-up to the older (and very-fine), sit-com .. Barney Miller. (opinions only)"
1,Does the studio understand the damage they're doing?,"The fact that the studio hasn't released this or the rest of ""Night Court"" simply means one thing: I haven't bought any OTHER TV series in a long while, since I can't trust the studios to finish what they started.If I *ever* buy another TV series again, it will be the ""complete set"" and not just ""one season and we'll see how it sells"" trash."
1,Waiting for Night Court,"I agree with all the comments made. Some were made as far back as 2006. I would like to also know what the deal is. Most fans of Night Court, although we watched the first season, would agree the remaining seasons were the best. the characters in the second season were more ""wacky"" (my kind of people). I am one of those who prefer not to purchase the first season and wait for the rest. But if the powers that be are waiting for us to give in, maybe we should just so we can get the other seasons on the shelves....NOT!GIVE US WHAT WE WANT!!!! AND WHAT WE WANT IS THE REST OF NIGHT COURT!!I search the shelves of the video stores weekly hoping to see them there. :-("
1,The time has come!! More Night Court!!!!,"OHMYGOD- I have been waiting sooooo frigging long for the rest of the Night Court DVD's!!!!!! This was the FUNNIEST show on in the 80's and still one of the funniest!!! I've been dying to see the middle seasons forever!!! I'm sick of getting my hopes up and looking for them in vain!! I agree with other people how Season One was the least desirable and it didn't hit comedy genius level until later,but still I bought it and eagerly waited for the others. Holy crap,some of the other shows I've seen available on store shelfs are laughable(not in a good way!!) yet still no wonderful,hilarious,brilliant Night Court! Warner Bros. should be ashamed! Wake up,you stupid suits!!!!!"
3,Gets better season-on-season,"Although Markie Post and Marsha Warfield haven't joined the cast in this Second Season, this is still a great show that just improves exponentially. I can't wait for the later seasons to be released on DVD, but until such time, I'm going to enjoy my Seasons 1 & 2 DVDs!"
4,"I NEED my ""Night Court"" -- not just Season One; the Whole Thing!","C'mon, producers -- get on the stick and start rolling out the rest of this classic comedy series. Its laughs don't fade with time, nor does its fanbase. As soon as I purchased Season One, I signed here at Amazon to be notified for Season Two. Please don't make my wait (and that of others) too long!There are more fans out there waiting to buy than are writing here. I'm busy recreating for my home collection the best of ""Must See TV - Thursday"", one of the funniest and classiest times for network television: ""Cheers"" and ""Hill Street Blues"" are the rest of the story, but ""Night Court"" has to be in there, too."
3,Night Court - Season 2,Basically the quality of the 1st Season is continued here; despite some cast changes. No doubt this was hard as sometimes some tv shows are only good in the first season and they find it hard to maintain the standard or they run out of ideas; not so here. Also I found both the Season 1 and Season 2 DVD's of good quality and overall good value for money; highly recommended. P.S. If you have a PAL only / non U.S. NTSC DVD Player you won't be able to play them ( I'm from Australia ).
5,Finally,"Yes, looks like they may be releasing this after all. Everyone write a review expressing how much you want buy this when it comes out so that it doesn't get shelved again."
3,a mediocre mini-series featuring storm,"this book collects x-treme x-men #36-39. this story arc was orig going to be a limited series, but they made it part of the core series, prob. to increase sales b/c the story is so mediocre and full of holes. claremont gets bogged down in set-up and doesn't develop the actual story nearly enough. the story is so quick and shallow the only reaction you'll get is ""huh? so what?""it's another arena story which claremont has already done in other series, this time featuring storm. storm is a great character, but she doesn't do anything new here. at least we get to see some old favs, like callisto (w/ some great new upgrades), strong guy, and yukio. masque is the main villain. kordey's art isn't his best and his average art is really unremarkable. he does have some nice costume designs, though, and as a bonus this TPB includes some of k's design sketches of costumes and his floorplan for rogue's house (although rogue is barely in this series)."
5,A thrilling book you can't put down.,This book made me just want to drop everything I'm doing right now and run away to South America and go to seek through the jungle.
3,they need a new editor,"great bands, great music, wordy writers, lazy editors, busy & difficult to read layout."
1,This is a FAKE. This movie has never been released by a studio on DVD.,"Do not buy this. Not because it isnt a great movie, which it is, but this is a bootleg - made obvious by the all region playing code. Not only that, the picture quality is bad. Hold out until the real thing shows up!"
1,Total Rip Off,All I had to do was just see the first shot in this film to know it originated on VHS.Do NOT buy this DVD!
4,Should Be On DVD!,"I have heard and read that when this movie was released in movie theaters that the critics trashed it and I have heard people saying that it was a box office flop but I remember watching The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia on cable and liking it. The Title of the movie is taken from a song from the 70s sung by Vicki Lawrence (Yes the same Vicki Lawrence from The Carol Burnett Show and Mama's Family). The movie stars Dennis Quaid as a country singer and Kristy McNichol as his teenaged sister who travel to Nashville when he gets in trouble with the law and there Kristy's character falls in love with a cop played by Mark Hamill. This movie in my opinion is much better then what the critics said and I think that Dennis Quaid, Kristy McNichol and Mark Hamill were all very good and I wish this movie would be transferred to DVD because since I got my DVD player and have seen how much better DVDs are then video tapes I don't buy movies on video anymore!"
1,The movie is good but the Copy from VHS to DVD is awful...,This movie has not been released on DVD. The person who is creating this sale is someone who is copying the VHS onto a DVD. Its an awful copy. Very fuzzy and extremely annoying that I paid for something so awful. I've never watched the whole movie because its extremely fuzzy. DO NOT BUY THIS. Wait for the real DVD.
2,The Night The Lights Went Out In Georgia (All Region DVD),it took two weeks when it shoukd have been fast mail
4,Oldie but goodie,This was one of my favorite movies as a kid it still was just the way I remembered it
2,NEW REMASTER DVD AVAILABLE!,"This DVD release by Newstar is all over the internet. It says inspired by Reba's version of the GA song but she had not even recoreded it yet when the movie was first released.... it was actually Vicki Lawrence. The obvious VHS transfer is dark and blurry. So mnay of us have complained but it is the only way to see this great film, unless you own one of the old VHS copies that are getting harder to find. I bought a new import copy of this film and was shocked how good it looked... no blurry pic, no darkness in the bar scenes.... great menus! Just wanted to let anyone looking for something much improved for less money, it's available at 70s-tv.com. Until the real thing shows up... I am VERY HAPPY to see the full picture in vivid color and detail."
1,Piece of Crap,"I ordered this DVD and it became apparanr after about 10 seconds that this was a very, very poor copy of a bootlegged movie. The color was faded out and yellow and the movie looked a sif a poor quality video camera recorder this movie being played on a poor quality TV set. I returned this move and got a prompt refund but be aware about buying movies that are hard to find. There's a reason that they're so hard to find."
3,night the lights went out in Georgia,Movie is good but on our new tv looks horrible. The picture is very fuzzy. the old movies were not mmade for these new tv's.
2,pillows,"Before I buy anything on Amazon, I do some research to see if its worth the money and how many people gave it various amounts of stars. I bought the machine thing last year. Instead of buying these pillows, I put my cleanser or an exloicator on it and then, I use it. I liked the pillows that came with it but I don't have the money to get these pillows"
2,dissappointed,I thought it was going to have more interesting and thought provoking questions... seem mostly absurd or going for the gross effect. 13 year boys would get a kick out of it.
2,If I had read it in a book store I would not have bought it.,It is okay - but after the first few pages I thought I was in 4th grade again.
1,Not appropriate for Youth,"This book is not appropriate for youth. It has numerous questions about sex and infidelity. While there certainly are some questions that are thought provoking, funny and good discussion starters, I would look for something else if your intention is to use it for any age youth, including High School or college students."
3,"Great sound, but hurt my bigger ears in how they rest.","I got a pair of these headphones with my RCA MP3 player, and they work ok. My biggest thing is that after about 30 minutes on, the way they clip to the ear, the edge of my ear feels sore, but also they irrirate just behind my ears where they rest, so they get uncomfortable. So, they are ok, but they do have other models available of hear bud size headphones that clip into the ear that are more comfortable on my ears. you just have to try them if you can before you buy them."
5,great,I bought this item on amazon. It arrived in a timely fashion in good working order.Who could ask for anything more?
1,My mistake!!,"I failed to notice the word ""narrow"" in the description of this beater. It doesn't fit correctly (too small) for my kitchenaid lift bowl mixer. I was so disappointed. Also stuck it in the dishwasher before using and the finish comes right off. Again, didn't do my research...can't be put in dishwasher! I ended up purchasing the correct beater at the official Kitchenaid site for same price but paid for shipping. Be sure you have a narrow bowl before throwing your money away like I did. My fault though!"
1,metal mixer beater,"My wife doesn't like the K5ABB stand mixer beater, it rubs against the inside of her 5qt bowland leaves a dark metal mark on the interior surface."
1,"If there were a MINUS 5 Star rating, I would give it. KITCHENAID, GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER!","Horrible flecks come off into frosting while it's turning. Horror of horrors when you are trying to mix frosting for an important event, and your expensive ingredients get RUINED with metal flecks. KitchenAid had better do a better job with it's quality control. I'm about to shop for a different mixer."
2,Disappointed,This review is from: KitchenAid K5ABB Stand Mixer 5qt Narrow Bowl Burnished replacement beater (Kitchen)I much prefer the painted beater as you can toss the beater in the dishwasher. Like others I washed this unpainted beater in the dishwasher and the beater is now a dull gray. I hope KitchenAid realizes the white painted beater is what most customers want.
2,"Not what is pictured, Not what I wanted GRRRRRR",I was very disappointed when I received this item that it was not what I ordered. It is different from what is pictured. Had it been pictured correctly I NEVER would have ordered it. There were other auctions that I would have went with instead. The correct picture for this auction is available because there are other auctions that have it. Slow service too. I would not do business with them again. I shop WYSIWYG.
5,Not quite like the picture shows,"I was nervous about ordering this because the picture shows a small protrusion coming out of where it would attach to the mixer, and my current beater does not have any such protrusion. However, based on other internet research it appeared to be the right beater for my mixer (K5AWW, which is a 5qt model with the bowl lift, not a tilt head model). Sure enough, the beater came and there was no protrusion and it fit my mixer fine.This was a good replacement for my chipped-white beater. If you're looking at this product, you are probably trying to replace your chipped beater too! The ""burnished"" finish means I shouldn't have to ever replace this one..."
5,Nice replacement beater,"I think this is a Kitchenaid beater, so it works just fine. I bought it to replace my original one, which was enamel over aluminum. The aluminum corroded under the enamel and swelled and cracked it. This one is just aluminum with no coating. The only issue will be to not run it through the dishwasher. I just hand wash it, no big deal. Hopefully it will outlast the mixer!"
3,I never was that crazy about Yar anyway...,"This episode takes place on a planet, where an evil skin (an oil slick) has been left by a vacated race...they 'shed' there negative qualities..forming this 'skin of evil' and left it behind. So. Well. Hmmm. Mediocre episode...and to be honest, I always felt Denise Crosby overacted anyway...her expression I felt was not subtle enough for STNG, too over-the-top. So, I don't entirely dislike the episode. Nothing personal Denise."
5,The Oil Slick from Vagra II,"The Early Demise of Tasha YarIn a very poignant episode; Tasha meets her tragic end. Armus, the oil slick alien arbitrarily kills Tasha. He seems to made of the remaining biological skin from a people who no longer need bodies to sustain life. Following this so far??.....Remember the living beams of light in the original series? The Organians? Well, folks it looks like when these folks evolved into life forms composed of light....Armus was the skin that was left over.........Yuck!If you can suspend your belief in reality in this crazy sci-fi concept this episode is better than most. Tasha leaves a holographic last message for the crew that will bring tears to the eyes. If you can sit through the giant oil slick from space; you'll enjoy this one."
3,Tasha is killed by an annoying villain...,"The villain in this episode, Armus, isn't really that much of a threat. And he's really annoying too. Tasha Yar dies so quickly, we almost don't believe it happened. Counselor Troi and Expendable Crewman #28b are trapped in a shuttlecraft surrounded by a large walking chocolate syrup monster. This guy can force people to do things for his own amusement, but fails to be amused by the Enterprise crew. Picard never even breaks a sweat in defeating Armus. This is a significant episode only because of Yar's death. The rest is just the usual muck from the first season."
4,Good for its price and as a collectible,"This figure comes at a very cheap price and this is the only Kingdom Come Flash action figure I've seen (understandable since he wasn't a crucial part of the Kingdom Come plot). While it wouldn't be a very good toy for a child to play with, it is still a good addition to any collection for fans of Kingdom Come, the Flash and DC superheroes."
3,A little overpriced,"Granted that the Flash in KC has only one color and exists in all planes of reality, the figure in that sense remains faithful to the story. But $15 + S&H is a little too much for a figure that basically looks like a blow pop and has only the helmet as an accessory. But don't think that the figure is not worth getting...it is a great addition to your kingdom come collection but not for the price being charged. If you look at other chracters in the series such as Deadman and Captain Marvel you'll notice the amount of detail that went into its making. In comparison, the Flash falls very short. Also, it features the same amount of ""articulation"" that is characteristic of the KC series, which is very limited. In my opinion, you are better off getting it cheaper from e-bay or such."
1,What the heck?,"I am a LONG-TIME fan of the Flash. I watched Wally West grow up from child to adult. I was pleased with the story direction they took the Flash in with Kingdom Come and it's sequel series The Kingdom. So why does this figure look so bad? I get the red blur, but this is ridiculous. He still had the lightning, the gold accents to his costume, and the helmet of Mercury (the winged helmet thing that Jay Garrick, the first Flash, wears and which Wally wears in Kingdom Come and the Kingdom as an homage) has freakishly huge wings.Only for someone who's an action figure fiend. NOT, I repeat NOT for fans of the character."
5,Make sure you are getting the correct plug,"Like an idiot, I didn't read the ""RB"" at the end of the product ID. I was a professional installer for 3 years and didn't even notice I had the WRONG PLUG IN MY HAND when I cut the harness and wired it up to an alpine plug. But its not the seller's fault. The item is exactly as the seller described it, and the item arrived promptly. To those buying this item, this is the REVERSE plug. It is used for replacing the factory wiring if it was cut out."
2,Incomplete / missing items,"The bow and arrow set itself is good...it was delivered missing the multi-colored targets, finger tabs, and arm guard. I was looking for something with a complete set and am disappointed with what I got!"
4,Gift,"I bought this set as a gift for my 10 year old grand son who lives in a different state, Tx, so i can't judge it for quality, ect. He seems to like it so far and the price was good for a starter set . was delivered quick to his home, so i was happy with this product."
4,sturdy archery set,"I got this archery daughter for my daughter who is 9 years old and probably stronger than the average girl of her age. However, pulling back the string all the way is hard for her and she is barely able to do it. Apart from that it's a cute and robust bow."
3,Decent for Beginners,"Got this for my daughter for Christmas. The bow was as expected, but the arrows were useless in 10 minutes. Luckily, I went to Dicks before Christmas to buy extra arrows, just in case.Caveman"
4,Looks like a nice bow. Daughter going to love it.,Just what I was looking for. Probably not the best in the market but certainly seems nice for the price.
5,Bought for my 7 year old nephew,"My brother-in-law is a hunter, and so, my nephew likes similar interests. I looked for a product that would be age appropriate that he would still enjoy and found this for his birthday."
4,Nice bow,The bow is great but the arrows it comes with are not the best. Overall I was very happy with the product.
4,is a fine set but...,The bow is great but the arrows arent so good.My daughter had to tape some parts. And the bow is really strong.
3,Does not come as described,"Product description says it comes with finger guard, arm guard and target. It did not include any of those items and the packaging is different from what the picture shows. The kids havent used it yet, but its always disappointing when you don't get what you expected. Here I was at minimum, expecting the product to come with the arm guard."
3,"Not bad, not great!","It is exactly what you should exect o bet i around 30 dollars.The bow itself is relatively tough, and well made. The arrows on the other hand are crap. They feel like they could fall apart atvany minute, and are barelybheld together with what looks like glue...I would suggets finding another option. Try something else."
3,Great starter bow!,"This is a great starter bow for any kid, my 11yr old and 8yr old loves to go out every evening when I get home to shoot it. Great buy!"
1,No Multi-Colored Target Included,"Overall, the bow is nice, but the advertisement for the product is misleading as there was no multi-colored target or target of another sort included with the bow and arrows. I tried to figure out who to contact through Amazon to fix this error, but it appears to be more hastle than it is worth. Amazon, you should fix your advertising for this product or knock off a few bucks for those of us who now have to either a. make a target ourselves or b. go buy a target."
5,Nice bow,"I got this item as a christmas gift so I have yet to see it out of the packaging, but I can tell just by looking at it that it is durable and well made. When I first thought of purchasing this item I was worried about the kids possibly getting hurt and how sharp the arrows would actually be, but now that I see them Im not worried at all. The arrows look to have a metal tip that is safe for children to use but still pointed enough to penetrate a target. Im sure my stepson is gonna love it. I recommend this highly. Great Product!!"
4,Great Bow,"My son is 8 years old and it's a little tough to pull back, but I think it makes him more careful because of the difficulty. I have 3 sons, and they all enjoy shooting the bow, the bow has held up well so far."
5,Jr compound bow,This is a awesome bow and arrow set. I bought it for my 8 year old granddaughter but it is so high quality that I wouldn't mind having it for myself.
4,Good Bow for price,My 8yr old loves it. A bit much of a draw for him but he will grow into it. a great buy.
3,"Very easy to draw, but arrows don't fly straight","Very easy for little kids to use, but arrows don't really fly level or straight--sometimes turn sideways in the air."
3,"Ok product, but great price, and fast shipping!","I guess you get what you pay for. Amazon definitely had a really good price, but this product, 2 days after the 30 day window, had some issues. Of course, if you Google it (which I should have done first) you'll find it's a common issue. The bow string doesn't hold up and doesn't take much to wear. One it starts wearing down, the arrows don't lock in very well, which can be a safety concern. Also, the bow string slipped off the wheel, which was a huge pain. I contacted Barnett, though, and they sent me a replacement bow string assembly. All in all, though, this is about the best bow you can get under 25lbs."
4,Nice Beginner Set,I bought this for my 11 year old daughter. It has been in contsant use ever since. She can pull the bow back pretty easily. Everyone in the family has enjoyed the archery set. Very good quality for the price paid. I would recommend this item.
4,Nice little starter bow,"Good for children 8 and up. shoots accurately to about 20 ft, I would recommend only for fun but not serious archery."
4,I would buy it again,Great little set for my 9 year old daughter. Very well made and she is having a blast with it!
4,Great Bow but more powerful than I expected,Bought this for my 11 year old daughter and she loves it. It's a good bow and she can handle it fine but it's very powerful and probably more than I should have gotten for our suburban neighborhood. We had had trouble finding an adequate place for her to shoot it without worrying about it being a danger to neighbors should the arrow go over the fence. Don't mistake the fact that it's kid sized for the idea that it's not a real bow that will shoot arrows hard enough to be dangerous.
5,Well worth the money,I got this for my 9 year old son that was using a re curve with a 6lb pull. He does very well with this bow and it's size is perfect!! He loves it alot and I think that it's better than some that are much more expensive.
2,"Poor accuracy, terrible arrows",First time buying a bow for my 11 yr old. The two included arrows are junk. Throw them away. I bought four aluminum arrows and they work much better. Still though it's hard to really know where the arrows going to go. I recommend spending more so your child will not get frustrated by lack of consistency of the bow.
5,Insightful Reading,"This script is mesmerizing. The subtleties of the dialogue clearly define the constitution of the characters. It makes the film more enjoyable. I now understand more clearly what the actions on the screen represented and what many of the motivations were. So much went into this story that when you think about it, this was an incredible piece of filmmaking."
5,Great Script and Movie,This script and character explanantion helps the viewer to understansnd the English accent and convoluted plot. A good buy.
5,GODSFORD PARK,AMAZON AGAIN THANK YOU FOR SUCH PROMPT DELIVERY.....THE BOOK WAS GREAT AND ARRIVED IN EXCELLENT CONDITION!!
2,"Sound concepts, but loaded with factual errors.","The book is a great idea, and the author obviously knows his stuff _very_ well. However, in my opinion, somewhere between the author's final manuscript, and what actually got published, someone at the publisher thought they understood things better.For example, in many cases, what the author says in the text doesn't match the final drawings. Or, when discussing calculations for voltage and current where the term 'miliampere' is used, it's defined as one millionth of an ampere- that's flatly incorrect, a miliamp is one thousandth of an ampere.So, if you buy it, get your calculator, pencil and pad out and be prepared to test the math and make the corrections in the book."
5,Excellent for the price of it,"This manifold set worked great, the gauges are a bit flimsy but you just have to be careful with them. The hoses and seals are of good quality."
1,buy the master cool set for $20 more,Dead on arrival. The low side gauge would not read any pressure and the plastic cover had popped off on the high side gauge during shipping. This product looks like some of the cheap stuff sold at Harbor Freight with a name that makes it appear that you are getting an American product. The Master Cool gauges are made in the U.S.A and at $20 more are a really good deal.
4,good gages,These were a nice set of gages with long hoses and no issues. There are dead-connects on the manifold to protect the open ends of the lines when not in use.
3,Manifold of Problems,"This product was shipped to me with a bad component. One of the hoses had the wrong size fitting on the end.....actually a 3/8"" thread instead of a 1/4"" thread as required. I called the factory to see if they would ship me just the hose but they would not and referred me back to Amazon. I tried Amazon and they wanted me to ship the whole unit back. By the way, they had no more in stock and said it would be a couple of weeks or so. So, I went out and found a shorter hose available locally and bought that. This is a good reason not to order on line from Amazon."
4,Item good - Shipping bad,The product was fine and worked as expected. It made my machine operator happy to have AC back in the cab.The shipping was terrible. I paid for 2 day shipping and it arrived in 4 working days (over a weekend) even allowing 1 day to process the order (one item).
3,"After changing fittings, It's works fine.","I have been using an R12 manifold for 20 years and decided to pick up a new R134 manifold. After lots of reading reviews on them, I chose this set. There are better sets out there, but for a weekend mechanic, I chose a less expensive set. It arrived , I opened it, only one hose end (the yellow angled end) would hook up to the manifold. The manifold fittings are incorrect at 3/8. They should have been 1/4. So I took the 1/4 fittings off of my old R12 set and put them on this new set. Now it is fine, but I can't believe someone is not trying these at the factory. They should not have 3/8 fittings at the manifold installer position or better quality control. Just my thought. I would have been upset if I had to go purchase 3 brass fittings for the manifold."
1,BS Picture,"I got sucked in by the picture as I needed an R134 set for the house with 1/4"" female-female connections. Though the pic shows that, these DO NOT come that way - they come with 1/2SAE MALE-14mm female or some such. AND the manifold is straight not angled like the picture. Does it matter? If you are doing only auto work, these are fine, and yes I'll be doing that. But, if you want to double dip on some home a/c or refrigeration, its a non-starter. For me, I'll eat the cost (not going to do shipping x3) and switch the gauges to my R12/22 manifold with 1/4-1/4 hoses and switch them back for any automotive applications. 1star for product mis-representation."
1,returned but never saw my money back,I got this gauge and the problem was the same the picture is different than the actual item. so I send it back with guarantee shipping but never saw my money back.
1,READ...Picture is not correct. manifold and fittings are different,This has different hoses than what re pictured. because of this they will not connect to regular home AC systems. You can see other reviews say the same thing. I asked Amazon to change their picture.
3,Breonna,"My Yorkie, Breonna looks so cute with these bows in her hair. I think It would be better if the elastic bands were a little bit bigger."
1,It didn't stay straight :(,"I was excited to receive the item and ready to make topknot for my yorkie.sadly this item doesn't stay in place on! love the colds and variety and great price but doesn't work ...I left one original feed back and I received email from company to offered me refund but they asked me to remove the negative feedback...This is my honest opinion about the product and I don't want other buyers to know some buyers felt this way and it worked perfect for other buyers.that is why I love this Amazon shopping. so If I have to remove my feedback, I don't need refund and keep this feed back instead.Thanks."
1,gold trimmed tiny grooming bows,from the picture these bows look really cute. but i opened the package and you can the rubber band all the way around the front of the bow too. should just be on the back of the bow only. i will not purchase these bows again. is ok for home. but not to take my dogs out in.
3,REGULAR,I DIDNT LIKE IT SO MUCH THEY ARE VERY BEAUTIFULL BUT THE BOW DIDNT STAY IN ITS PLACE AND MY TINY YORKIE TOOK IT FROM ITS HAIR....AHHHH.....UNLES YOUR DOG IS TRAINED TO DONT TAKE ITS BOW I DONT RECOMEND YOU THIS PRODUCT...
5,The Long Ships,"This music comes from one of my favorite movies I saw as a kid. I can not think of a movie where the film score is more entertaining or compliments the action as well. It's as alive as the characters on the screen. They should carve a national anthem for Norway out of it. The Lord Jim score is O.K. , but is in no way as memorable."
5,excellence in audio theatres,"TSN is simply amazing. if you get a chace to pick up either cd, you wont be disappointed. It is exhilirating, original, and true to life music. Thier shows are some of the most powerful i have ever seen."
1,"Silly, Obnoxious Music","This CD sounds like rather bad 80's synth. The lyrics are pretentious, and sound like something my seventh grade daughter would have written on her English assignment. I found this CD in her collection in fact, and she had found it in a used CD store for one dollar. In my opinion, I want her dollar back."
4,A Very Pretty Addition to my Flower Bed,"Until this year, I've never placed decorations in my garden. This is one of two solar statues I bought this year. Honestly, I hesitated buying anything with a fairy theme. I just wanted the novelty of the solar light. But this is very pretty and I'm more than happy with it. It's only about a foot high, so I put it right close to the house. Otherwise I wouldn't see it. The globe lights up fairly bright. This is painted white, and the rain and wind have worn some of the paint off, but that is only visible close up. It's also why I didn't give it 5 stars. Otherwise, it's lovely."
1,solar Kissing fairies--don't work...,"My solar kissing fairies looked great when it arrived, but within a week, the solar globe stopped working...I had already sent one item back, and did not keep the return pkging or label for this product as I thought it was working, so did not believe it would stop functioning...now I am stuck with it as I do not have a way to return it...I don't mind spending money for a good product, but this was a huge disappointment!! I tried to see if it was just the solar battery, but it would not turn on at all, so I believe water leaked into it...it should be made to keep water out as it is meant for gardens...wish I had not purchased it!!"
1,VERY disappointed!,"it is a buautiful looking peace for the garden, however it specifically says the statue is 20 inch tall and 17 inch wide and this is a LIE!!!its ONLY 9 inch tall and 7 inch wide!i have waited for this item hoping it will be a pretty focal point in my garden when really its no more than a small dull statue!definitely NOT worth the price for such a small statue, and the lies about its size are absotutly infuriating!i will not buy from this seller again even if my life would depend on it and i will claim a refund for the LIES they sold me!"
3,Zipper Issues,"This is (was) a terrific bag. I've had it for about a year and a half, and on about 15-20 trips. It pulls very nicely and is easily recognizable on the airport luggage turnstyles. One problem...all of the zippers have let loose and won't work anymore. I tried to exchange the product for an identical one at Target, but it was past their 60 day return policy...very disappointing. They directed me to the factory who sent me two new zipper pulls. I'm waiting to get those put on locally, but am a little skeptical. Bottom line...a bag this good should use better zippers."
3,eileen cannot be duped!,"eileen donnelly is in a trainwreck after which,a sinister man(with personal motives)switches eileen's identity with the woman who was with him(his wife sophie-who was killed). later eileen's fiance, guy was asked to identify the dead body and guy knew is was not eileen-no one believed him so,guy hired a private detective. together,they were unable to prove anything,but they did not give up the search for eileen.after the accident,""mr sinister"" (sir henry welwyn)takes eileen to his home where she is kept drugged up,watched over,and locked up! why is sir henry doing this to poor eileen? what are his motives?through it all,eileen and guy NEVER gave up on eachother. the power of the love they felt for one another kept them both strong. at the conclusion of the story,the nightmare does end. this was a so-so story. i read it through in one hour."
4,lift master,"this unit is easy to install, and works perfectly, some of the problems i have seen in the reviews never materialized, like with the cable tension monitor.installed as per instructions, and it worked perfectly, and about raising the door the entire way up and not being able to bring it back down. my door is 10X16 insulated door and picking it up the entire way and then closing is no problem at all. i installed the door and the opener myself, the opener took less than 2 hours from start to finish to install. it is so quiet i could not believe how smooth and quiet it was. the only negative i could find is that the door is either up or down you can not stop the door where you want. besides this this is a quality opener and would buy another one without question"
2,If I could only get it to work,"Unfortunately, the opener has not performed as advertised and neither has the customer service. Buy it through someone local so they can install it and deal with the headache of getting it to work."
1,disastisfied,"I have this unit and have had other liftmaster garage door openers. They malfunction about twice a year. I paid over the cost of the opener on service. Seems like clockwork when it comes to breaking down. There's a number place on these openers to call when you need service. How convenient! Some mornings I'm about to go to work and my garage door is wide open!! This is putting my family at a risk. I will never buy another liftmaster. If I can give no stars I would! Save the heartache and trouble, and get something better! These cheap clunkers are manufactured in Mexico, and man do they suck."
1,"Poor Product, Warranty and Customer Service","Installed two of these in a new home in 2008. One broke down after a year and the second broke down after two years. The warranty is next to useless since it covers only parts and not labor. It took ten days to receive replacement motor from Tucson and then the labor to remove unit, replace motor and reinstall unit was $200 and took another several days. This is after having installed Chamberlain/Liftmaster garage door products in two other homes and having zero failures in 20 years. Customer service was argumentative, blamed their own installer, who actually does good work and took no responsibility. Avoid the Liftmaster 3800 unless you want to manually open your garage door a few weeks a year."
1,"Bad design, bad support","This product works in some applications but not in others. If it were designed a little differently, it would work much better in nearly all situations. It would be much better, as described in my comment on another review, if the motor operated in constant tension when closing the door so that if the door movement is slow at any point, the cable doesn't get ahead of the door and fall off the pulley or worse (one side of the door goes faster than the other, the door gets misaligned and falls off the track).All this has actually happened to me.Since most people (even my professional installers) won't know what the problem is, I consider this product unacceptably dangerous."
4,Great--but not for EVERY garage door. Know the Limitations,"This is a fabulous unit. We've had 3 of them installed, but we have found out that it has some limitations. First of all, you can't have tapered drums OR reverse wound drums--you have to have 4""-6"" cable drums that run along the backside of the wall. And since the unit rests on the torsion bar, the bar must be 1"" and have a minumum of 8"" between the side of the garage wall and the end of the torsion bar. Plus you need at least 3"" between the ceiling and the center of the torsion bar. If you don't have these specifications, then you might be better off with a typical garage door opener with a rail system.The openers run so smooth and quiet. We just love them."
5,Great press,"The grill press works very well and is the correct weight. Just make sure to ""season"" it before the first use."
2,"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap","I think my husband used these 3 times and both handles have damage. One is completely dried out and has split, the other is close. After receiving them I had to season them and they rusted just from humidity. I cleaned and seasoned them again and they rusted again. Not a good product at all. I will be replacing them with another brand."
5,"It works well, Season it first","I used to have a similar product years ago but it rusted and I stopped using it for sanitary reasons. I followed the seasoning instructions (not provided with the product by the manufacturer, but in a review of the product here on Amazon) and used the product for the first time Easter Sunday. It was great to have evenly cooked bacon that was flat, crisp and did not shrink as much as non press frying."
2,Grill Press,"Liked the idea of using to flatten food while frying, grilling. Hate when food curls. Useful, the first time. Regardless of how I tried to maintain for future use, rust developed. Would not, personally, purchase again."
3,DISAPPOINTED,DIDN'T ORDER IT FOR THE GRILL WOULD PROBALLY MAKE SOME ONE A LOT HAPPIER TO HAVE IT FOR THE GRILL BUT DID NOT TURN OUT TO BE WHAT I WANTED FOR INDOORS ON THE STOVE TOP
4,Great Nursery Baskets,"These are beautiful nursery baskets for the price. They include the liners, which most companies sell seperately. If you want solid white baskets, however, don't buy these. That is why they are called white-washed!!! But the white-washed look is very pretty in a baby's room and they hold diapers, wipes, and baby supplies very well."
2,I don't like this book,I actually had the professor who wrote this book for a class. I did not like the book at all. For a beginner as I was with no programming experience some of the examples led to more confusion than they solved. Some of the examples will build on code that you read several pages to several chapters back in the book and flipping back and forth to figure out what was done is annoying. The book is not all bad though I still use it some for reference since I paid 100 dollars or so for it when it was brand new... but if you are looking for a beginners introduction to C++ code go with a Schaums(sp?) outline or something that is more of a reference than this book which can be wordy at times.
1,wrong photo description,This is the photo from the May 1965 rematch when Liston was knocked out in the first round
5,What a great value. She is a fantastic instructor.,"She breaks the training into 2 parts - Modules and Labs. She explains what equipment you will need if you have it. But I have no Cisco equipment for my studies. But that's what makes the videos so great. She shows the equipment up close and explains what will happen. Just keep watching until you get it.She gives you hints on certain key points for the exam - what Cisco is looking for as the right answer. I've bought other video series with Heather Osterloh (Netware 4.11 and TCP/IP) and have never been disappointed. Once I saw her name on the video series, I new it was a quality product. And I was right. She is fun to watch and is thorough in her explanation of the material. These are a great value."
5,About This Book,"A quality piece of work from the Princeton University Press. This edition is now out of print.An oversized, oblong trade paperback, 330 pp with something like over 250 illustrations (mostly b & w; 32 color plates.)Nine essays on Luminism, each of them with End Notes. Index. 10 page Bibliography."
4,Good insight into the hunt for Escobar,"This documentary has limited re-enactments, which is a good thing; excellent insight by those involved. It is an informative reflection of the power Escobar held at that time and its impact on the country."
5,Fantastic!,"When I bought my bread machine I was thrilled and used the simple recipes that came with its booklet. Then I discovered this fantastic book. The recipes are fabulous. I have used several of them. If you have a bread machine and don't have this book, you are missing out!"
1,"colorful, but......","The book has many colorful pictures@ recipe quants. for 1, 11/2 &2 lb. loaves. That aside,4 of the recipes I tried were disasters, esp.the french bread(no sugar mentioned). I compared the recipe book that came along with the bread machine to this one, and they were quite different in ingredients and portions.I find the Gold Medal's Bread Machine book that I bought from the grocery store checkoutline producing more reliable results.I would not recommend this book."
5,The Most Useful Cookbook I Own,"I love the simplicity of this cookbook. If you are a sauce-lover like I am, you'll love it. The recipes are short & simple. They make creating fabulous sauces simple enough that even a person like myself who can barely cook can follow them and create impressive dishes. I got this with the purchase of an All-Clad pan and have come to depend on it over the years whenever I want to make a Bechamel, Sauce Mornay, etc. Fantastique!"
3,"I prefer books with pictures, I guess","This book is a small, thin paper back with a couple dozen recipes inside. It is very technical and is written well, but it is not what I was looking for."
2,How to make sauces and gravies,Very small hardcover book with not as much information as I imagined. Very fast shipping and arrived in excellent condition.
4,A diverse new album by a newgrass fiddling whiz,"Plenty of fine and fancy fiddling and picking from this veteran '70s newgrasser. Stylistically, this ranges all over the map, from relatively straightforward bluegrass to old-timey, Antebellum-flavored Celtic aires, and softer ""new acoustic"" style crossovers, all with solid musicianship. I prefer hearing Ostroushko stick to more old-fashioned material, which he excels at, but folks who've been introduced to his work via his appearances on ""Prairie Home Companion"" will probably enjoy this album in its entirety."
5,Wonderful find!,I found this musician featured at a concert by the Traditional Music Society of California. He is fantastic!
2,Not the Book I thought it would be...,I was very disappointed in this book. It is more of a coffee table book than a guide to setting tables. It has some beautiful photography and illustrations but there is hardly any writing.The few table that are shown are set with such expensive items you wouldn't be able to afford to put any food on the plates. I would not have purchased this book had I known this.
3,The Official Story,"Mr Sneed got many people to talk in there own words about the case. Unfortunately, as soon as I read the names I knew what they were going to say. The Dallas police force was the best,they were so clean it was scary! Every officer said the same thing-no conspiracy-both Oswald and Ruby acted alone! Only one admitted that Ruby did not go down the Main St. ramp-Officer Vaughn was telling the truth-and Gus Rose saying that the photo of the chevy in Gen. Walker's driveway had a whole obliterating the licence plate is a blatent lie. Nevertheless, I'm glad I read it because now I know what the researchers were up against trying to solve the case."
3,DRY AND PACIFYING...,"To conspiracy buffs and lone nut believers alike...this has got to be one of the most non commital and non emotional book about that day in Dallas ever written. Note to conspiracy buffs...almost all the stories sound TOO similar...like they have had ALOT of time to concur...to the lone nut Oswald did it folks..it will stike you odd about the dispassionate way all of the people tell their stories, I mean I realize the bulk majority were police and FBI, but it is just so dry, even if Oswald could be proven to be the lone nut, surely it shouldn't make the assassination less emotional. Literally it goes"" well I went down the steps and looked at the top of my shoe..blah!Blah!"" It is an okay book to have if you have a good collection already, and just want it to put with the rest."
3,"""The Dance Of Life""/It's here for you/It's calling you...","If you're a fusion fan with money to spare, buy this cd for the title track...Absolutley one of the top ten Fusion tracks of all time! The dance tracks the previous reviewer mentioned are good also."
4,naughty naughty,"Feral House is consistent in releasing highly interesting, esoteric works that dabble (or indulge) in controversial subject matter worth reading.This one takes the magic-meets-sex motif into unique territory; for instance, revealing intimate details about well-known occultists and intriguing tidbits such as the contention that Crowley was the one who introduced Aldous Huxley to mushrooms. The author leaves no rock unturned within this concentrated study.At times, the author goes on endlessly with heavy passages quoted from other sources (which proves tedious), but this is balanced by an insightful, judicious study of the subject matter that includes humorously exposing frauds whenever possible. The reader definitely feels compelled to keep turning the page.I recommend this one..."
4,Guitar Chops,"This album is fantastic! I bought it expecting it to be mostly guitar like BG's first solo effort. Not so! This album definitely has an emphasis on song writing. The songs are powerful and melodic. The quality of the production is almost perfect. You can hear all of the instruments, the vocals don't get drowned. It's just great, heavy, fun music. Brad Gillis shows off his technique with class.I love this cd, and highly recommend it to any guitar fan."
3,A second effort...,"Made in ITA, Serial# FRCD-081, Playing Time 48:51This is BG's second solo effort, and is a significant departure from his first, more guitar-driven, album ""Gilrock Ranch"".With a title like ""Alligator"" you'd expect power, music with a crunch (get it?) Well, this album is fairly tame, and a bit flat.The emphasis is more on ""songs"" than what I expected, and the guitar work is generally average (but there are some great moments.)Fairly uneven in its enthusiasm across the 10 tracks, and more radio-friendly than its predecessor, I was mostly disappointed: not that I expected a NIGHT RANGER album (which it isn't), but there's nothing on here that's really outstanding, except maybe for the title cut.Enjoyable overall, except perhaps through the almost instrumental ""Tanbark Tyrant"" with some children's ""la-la-la"" vocals, it still remains a valiant effort."
2,Did not like,"I did not like the book. It did have some interesting points to consider, but it did not seem like discipline to me. I am more of a Love and Logic fan. I think kids cannot always see the natural consequences of their own behavior (or don't care) until far into the future and must sometimes have consequences imposed upon them, which this book says not to do. I just don't agree with it."
2,Review,Book had good information. It's just that it's pretty much the same as a lot of books I've already read about this subject. I was looking for something more out of the box creative.
4,Nice idea,"I like the idea of this toy. It's not one of my daughter's favorites, but I think it is important to have around.The only think I don't like is that the fabric does not seem to be of very high quality. The exterior has discolored a bit, darkened over time."
3,Yay... Go Dillinger,"Zombie Apocalypse sucked. Haste was decent. Vaux was horrid. Unearth rocked. Break the Silence was iffy. Death By Stereo didn't even get a listening to. Most Precious Blood did an awesome and amazing cover of ""Sweet Child O' Mine""... despite what some may say. Time In Malta was iffy as well. Nothing beats The Dillinger Escape Plans cover of ""My Michelle""... Eighteen Visions did okay. Didn't sound like them too much. Every Time I Die and God Forbid... both were amazing. Bleeding Through was decent... and The Beautiful Mistake was boring.Go buy this cd if you like The Dillinger Escape Plan. It's crazy!!! Or Unearth, God Forbid, Most Precious Blood, Eighteen Visions, or Everytime I Die. Yay!!! It's hardcore."
5,Perhaps a Win-Win Situation,"You simply can't go wrong with a compilation like this. Kudos to Law of Intertia for putting together an album of this calibur. A handful of the best bands from the punk, metal, and hardcore genres covering one of the greatest acts of our time.There is something for everyone on this cd. Both old and new GNR fans will be extremely happy. Whether you are into more punk acts like Death by Stereo or the more technical Dillinger Escape Plan, they are all excellent tracks.This is definitely a must have compilation for 2004. Whether you are purchasing to hear some new material from a current favorite or just want to reminisce a little, I highly suggest you pick this up."
5,Niiiice,When I was surfing the web one day I came across a preview for this comp. I was very excited to see it too! GNR done by all of the bands that I love? Sounded like a good combination to me. So i went out and bought this cd right away.. And falls nothing short of amazing! There's a little something for everyone on this one. Axl should be smiling because this does his music justice.
2,rushed,"the most precious blood cover is probably the only worth while track on here, guns n' roses is great as are most of the bands on this record but the covers on here sound rushed and the album is a dissappointment. download the most precious blood song and be happy."
2,Pointless,"The CD starts out great, with the intro to 'Welcome to the Jungle' possibly done better than the original. Put once those first 15 seconds go by, it's all garbage. It's entertaining in a completely irritating way. You can't even identify some of the songs (e.g. You're Crazy and My Michelle), which would be a good thing if they spun them correctly, but they're nothing worth noticing. Most of the rest of the songs are near-carbon-copies, but sound way worse, are done with much less skill and only rarely are any harder. The classic Estranged is done without guitar solos and a nasaly singer. The intro riff to Sweet Child, possibly the most recognizable guitar riff of all time, is plinked out on a cheap piano. And the real chance for a beautiful HC re-interpretation, a cover of 'Used to Love Her' keeps the all-acousticness, which just shows you how misled this album is. Great idea, pointless results."
1,Stay doing your own stuff!!!!,"I am really into the metal and hardcore scene, but this cd was just horrible. I have most all of these artist cd's, which are great, but with them tring to do the older style of rock incorporated into their new metal style just turned out sounding like crap. None of gnr's songs were meant to be full out screaming. I am currently re-selling this cd on ebay because I dont even want it."
3,Good protection but hard to take underwater pictures (Minolta Dimage X1),"I bought this as a cheap replacement for my MCDG1 Marine Case for Minolta Dimage X1 that got stolen in Miami airport a few months ago (grrrr...). I was disappointed by the fact that it's almost impossible to take underwater pictures with it, but it works well to protect the camera from water, sand etc...Pros: Waterproof, good protection.Cons: Very hard to take pictures while the camera is inside it. The buttons are hard to reached as they are just under the plastic solder. Also the lens is a little to high to fit this case which resulted in a peace of dark plastic appearing on all my pics."
2,"Simple, poor quality","It was written that it should fit for Sony Camera T9 but it is not fit exactlty, you should fix it each time you want to take a shot."
2,"Ok, but there are better options out there...","I checked this book out of the library thinking it would provide a broad summary of the different perspectives on Sanctification, but what I found was a summary that excludes both the Lutheran perspective and the Catholic perspective (ie...Richard Foster).For a more comprehensive book, I suggest:Christian Spirituality: Five Views of SanctificationIt convincingly summarizes the Lutheran, Presbyterian, Wesleyan, Pentecostal, and Catholic views."
1,Bowling Shoes,"The shoe was much smaller than advertised, I ended up giving it to my son who has a smaller foot."
5,Eye Produce,"I've been using this product for many years, and I found that Amazon.com has then best priceonline."
5,Works great,This is by far the best electric pre-shave I ever tried. With this and Panasonic's Arc IV Nano are as good if not better than a 3 pass shave with Sensor blades.
3,Feels oily,"This product feels oily on my skin. I prefer pre-shave lotions with a ""brisk"" alcohol feel.The citrus scent is tolerable, but unscented would have been better."
2,Not what I expected,"Another trial in the hunt for a decent replacement to my dwindling supply of Lectric Shave Ultra. The best way I can describe this product is: greasy orange anus. It smells odd and makes my skin feel dirty and greasy. The only reason it gets two stars is because it did help me get a decent shave and didn't totally irritate my skin. For the price of the bottle and the nice selection of samples that came with it, I was expecting much better. Now I'm afraid to even try the samples."
4,excellent,"Great preshave prep, use less than you think you need. Fragrance not really to my taste, but not bad either."
3,Poor Control,The graphics and control of this game are pretty poor. The split screen can make you dizzy.
2,Duro-Med Convoluted Foam Chair Pad with Cover,"Chair pad is attractive but not very substantial. The patient using the pad is a large person and after two or three uses, the pad was squished so much, the patient refused to use it, saying it offered no support. Next time I'll look for a medical approved pad that is more durable."
3,Would have liked it thicker.,I have a feeling that I will be restuffing this soon as it is flattening out. I would have liked it a few inches longer also. I think this would be ideal for a wheel chair but it is not that great for a desk chair.
4,Needs more fluff,"This is a nice size for the chair or in the car. It just needs a thicker cushion inside.It flattens after two hours. I am only 133 pounds.It was a good price, so if you tend to get up often, it will bounce back."
4,Comfortable,"The pad is quite comfortable but difficult for an amputee to position himself on. After he moves to the wheelchair, it is necessary for him to lift himself up and I reposition it under him. Although a bit of trouble in the beginning, it makes sitting for 4+ hours in the wheelchair (he can't move like some) much more comfortable. Love that the cover is removable and washable."
1,Very poor quality,Very cheap foam. Foam crushed and matted within a few uses. Dad weighs 180 lbs so it can't be blamed on being over weight. Plus I bought two to rotate them. Both have compacted. The cover states it's polyester but feels more like plastic. Even at this price it's a waste of money. I will be looking for a replacement. Not worth the cost of return shipping.
2,Flat chair pad,"This is a klunker. It say's four inches thick,but it's more like three inches or less, and flat.I won't buy another."
1,No surprise there are negative reviews,It is only two inches thick. Beats nothing but that is about all it beats. So how many more words do I have to add to get to twenty? Apparently it really does count the words.
2,Like not having a pillow,"This pillow when you sit on it is as if no pillow is there, it is terrible, it`s like not sitting on a pillow at all!So if your weight is over 125 lbs, forget this pillow. I returned it!"
4,Comfy Pad,I found this pad to be very comfortable. It is a good value for the price. I only recently went into a wheelchair and the pad definitely makes it easier to ride in it for long periods of time. I also love the color it makes my chair easy to find. If you want something bright and cheery and comfotable I would recommend this pad.
3,Nice Colour,"The cushion has a nice colour but the opening was not surged and will be fraying out soon. From the first time my nephew saw it he said it is defective and you will have to return it, I told him that was just the opening to change it out. It does not really hold up under use and seem to flatten out quite quickly. Make your product more durable."
4,good cushion,"Doc recommended a gel cushion. Tried that, not much relief. Ordered these for my hard chairs and have been very pleased. Bony butt is feeling better!"
2,FOAM PAD,Service was great. Pad is so-so. Does not give much padding. Was expecting a much firmer pad.
4,An odd Sound that Fits just Right,"The music of aLunaRED, or however they abbreviated their name, is an odd sort of mix. The track ""Cut Ups"" is probably the stand out track to me and one which even 8 years after it's making stands out as an incredible Post-Hardcore blend of aggressive vocals and electronica (Think the Faint with a deeper set of vocals). ""The Shade"" is a beautifully crafted song that showcases the diversity of the band. The track is rather melodic, subdued, and relaxing. If you stumble across this, it's worth checking out for the once HIP 00's college student."
5,Best guide to out of the way inns,"This book describes inns that you do not find on line or in the usual search engines. We stayed at two of them in Sept 2008 and felt very happy to have ""discovered"" both."
4,only book of its kind,"As of June 2006, this was the only book I could find with the information I needed to plan a trip through the Bernese Oberland section of the Swiss Alps. Even the internet proved less helpful than this cohesive, complete guide to hikes and accommodations in a fairly remote area. The book helped me plan a wonderful, memorable trip. My only wish is that the maps were drawn to scale."
5,Gateway to Fabulous Adventure,"I have used both of the Lieberman books to plan three different hiking trips in Switzerland. They were right on with their information and recommendations. When used in conjunction with other more serious hiking guides,it is very possible to do unique inns while hiking numerous areas of Switzerland.The stays at the Inns were memorable and much less populated than many places. Great Work !"
3,Hopkins wiring kit for Chevy/GMC 1988-1998,"The wiring kit made it easy to add trailer lighting to the truck. The only problem I had was the molded plastic was a little over sized for the Chevy wiring harness, and did not want to insert all the way. After about two hours working with it I got it inserted all the way, it worked well after that."
4,Should be reprinted,"A wonderful tale of magic and time travel I read 10 years ago or more. I came to Amazon to search by title not remembering the authors name. This story pits a young sorcerer against the supreme, Magus Rex. If the young man can follow Magus Rex and his daughter whom he is attempting to court across time, the Magus will allow them to marry.I would settle for a used copy in an instant"
1,This is not the truth!,The Book of Mormon does not contain the truth! The Bible is the true Word of God! Please read the Bible for yourself.
5,Book of Morman,This is the best book in the world! It is so amazing. The answers to all your questions. Morman's rock!
2,Joseph Smith actually told some truth here.,"The only truth he told was in the front of the original (1830) ed of the Book of Mormon. He lists himself (correctly) as the author and proprietor of the work. Later editions claim his as a translator -- just like he translated the Kinderhook plates.This ""most correct book"" contains numerous spelling errors and grammatical errors. Elohim's spell checker must have been off line when Joe was writing this one."
1,Crap Conversion,"It says ""converted from it's physical edition"".Baloney.I ditched it after findin my hard copy easier to read and use.I found this site in another review tat has everything that th church has published FOR FREE!ldskindlemobi.blogspot.comUgh...Wish I had known earlier"
3,Interesting work of fiction...,"Having read the Book Of Mormon twice (cover to cover), I find the text an interesting conversation piece and nothing more. I would not recommend it for the casual reader. Unless you live in Utah, there isn't much relevance."
5,WAS SO GLAD I COULD GET THIS ON MY KINDLE,"WAS GLAD I COULD GET THE BOOK OF MORMON ON MY REGULAR KINDLE,IT MAKES IT SO MUCH EASIER FOR ME"
5,kindle edition has no table of contents,"Note for kindle users: if you want one that has a ToC then download the ""gospel library"" gospel app [official]. 5 Stars since I love the book so much in print, and seem unable to leave a review solely for its kindle edition."
1,this is a different book,"The vast majority of these reviews come from people who have read the version REVISED in the '80s. As another reviewer pointed out, get this version and a more recent version for a very interesting look at the changes the Mormon church has made over the years. Read how ""evil"" people are ""cursed with a skin of blackness."" Read in the original version about how the ""righteous"" will one day become ""white and delightsome"", changed to read ""pure and delightsome."" And understand that this was, in part, the basis for certain so-called ""racist"" policies w/in the Mormon church, allegedly retracted in 1978.When the Mormon missionaries knock on your door, be afraid--be very afraid."
1,hate,"I didn't really care for this app, it was really hard to find a certain scripture in it. So I got another app that I love."
1,BOOK OF MORMON,"BE AFRAID. BE VERY AFRAID OF THE BOOK OF MORMON AND THE MORMONRELIGION. IT IS A CULT AND ITS' MEMBERS BELIEVE ONLY IN THE JESUSOF THE BOOK OF MORMON. SEARCH ""THE TRUE BELIEFS OF THE MORMON CHURCH""ON GOOGLE AND FIND OUT WHAT THEY REALLY BELIEVE."
3,"Content excellent, just don't like the format",The format wasn't what I was looking for so I got a different version. I love this inspired book and the insight I get from it.
5,I love it.,It is the truest book on earth. I love it. I recomend it to everyone who wantrs to know about ChristDelbert D. Lambson
5,Book of Morman,"With purchasing my Kindal, all I needed to lighten my load on Sundays was the Book of Morman and the Bible. Now I can keep up with the teacher on Sundays and bookmark my pages ahead of time. The font sizes are just right so I don't have to use my reading glasses (that I normally forget at home) to see the words. I have matched this with my hardback book and they are the same. My husband & I are very happy with this book and hope others will enjoy it as well."
5,BOM,This book of scriptures is a book that provides most of the anwsers to a life of joy and fulfilment in my life. It could be in your life as well.
4,What's great about this...,"Well, what I like about the B of M is that some of the verses are exquisitely crafted. Some of the prayers are amazingly sincere and beautiful, moreso than any other mainstream Christian work. I read this book, not thinking ""this is all wrong,...no archaeology to support it"", but ""lots of people believe this is true. Why?"" I found plenty of reasons to enjoy it rather than disect it. Read it if you dare. :)"
5,The Book of Mormon,"While I miss the footnotes, I still love having the Book of Mormon on my Kindle for my bedtime reading."
5,Excellent testimony of Christ,This book is focused on Christ and bears witness of him. This book carries a message of hope and peace through the atonement of Christ.
1,Clear as Mud,"I bought this book to learn more about this secretive religion. It is about as easy to read and understand as the Old Testament. I will keep it for reference, but am not likely to ever read it."
2,Yeah...,"I didn't really enjoy this book. I thought that there were some interesting stories, but overall I did not like it."
1,Boring work of fiction,"I was raised Mormon and believed for many years, but the keystone of their religion is crumbly. The doctrines of the Book of Mormon do nothing more than reflect biblical teachings with a few minor clarifications and the ""history"" is so easily disproved that second grade history books touch on things that disprove the Book of Mormon (e.g. ancestry of the Native Americans, plants and animals that didn't live in the Americas before Columbus, etc.). If you are looking into Mormonism, I recommend that you check out mormonthink.com before you commit to anything - they'll explain a lot of the problems with the Book of Mormon and church history, but they explore both sides of the conversation. The main reason I left Mormonism is because the church lies to its members and it lies to get converts and discovering that was so painful I couldn't continue."
1,Why pay for a free book?,"If you want a copy, get it free from the mormons instead of paying for it. If you want the real story try these websites:http://www.exmormon.org/http://home.teleport.com/~packham/http://exmormonfoundation.org/"
1,open mind,"Book has alot of inconsistencys. This is not a Christian religion, more of a cult. Why is it a cult? Readers are to take the word of this man against the Bible. Noway! Interesting to look at the earlier copys as well.I encourage all to read and come to a conclusion for yourself, coparing this (book of moron) to christian theology."
2,old fiction is still fiction,"Until humanity stops quibbling over whose imagined history is more real, or whose invisible god is more powerful, we will always be doomed to war and cultural hatred. I submit two books to read in order to explore your doubts after reading this book: ""Why I am Not a Christian"" (Bertrand Russell) and ""The Demon Haunted World"" (Carl Sagan)."
1,false book,"This is a false version of the great book that I know.The true version is not only FREE, but is the finnest and greatest book that I know. The truth is free. The lie that is this ""autherized version"" costs you more than it's worth."
1,Great book for comparing the changes that have been made,"Over the years there have been thousands of documented changes from the original book of mormon and the current authorized addition. For those mormons who doubt it, buy it and check it our for yourself. Someone explain to me why Joseph Smith's ""inspired"" translation would have to be changed please?"
2,Who can actually believe this??,"I bought this book because I know some people who are Mormon and I was curious about their beliefs. I am born again Christian and know the Bible really well. I love exploring other religious texts. This book is just too outlandish. I was shocked and appalled by the first chapter and it only got worse from there. So much of it is just unrealistic, historically incorrect and just plain nuts. I can't believe so many people believe this is true! Of course every chapter seems to tell you that if you don't believe it you're going to hell...so that might be why. I just don't see how logical intelligent people can believe things like a God telling someone to murder someone else or people's skin changing color because of sin, or, this is the worst, people digging up steel along with gold, silver and other metals. Steel in the earth? Really? I must admit I have not read the entire book yet. I will eventually but I can only handle so much of it at a time."
3,A review only of the kindle ebook,"As the heading suggests, this is a review only of the free ebook. This book does not contain the chapter summaries and has weird formatting problems which causes a word wrap every few words and so you often only get one or two verses on the screen at a time. I realize that free is a good thing, but honestly from a non mormon perspective (as mine), reading this edition is a pain.I fully recommend to anyone wanting to explore the book of mormon pay the $1 and get the LDS triple scripture pack found here (which also contains the more interesting Pearl of Great Price):LDS TRIPLE COMBINATION (Premium Kindle Edition): Book of Mormon | Doctrine and Covenants | Pearl of Great Price - CONTAINS FULL CHAPTER HEADINGS (ILLUSTRATED) (Latter Day Saints LDS)"
3,"Poor navigation, not very readable","I'm not very impressed by the formatting of this book. It marks every sing verse with the scripture reference, e.g., Alma 6: 3 and then it reads it then Alma 6: 4. Most Book of Mormons or other types of scripture with have a Chapter heading, e.g., Alma 6, and then mark each verse. The word wrappings don't work very well, which might indicate that I am in the wrong font size, but most eBooks should adjust around the preferred font size. And there is no navigation, it just goes right into the Book of Mormon. I guess if you are looking for a specific verse you can just search for it, since each verse has it full scripture reference.However, it IS free, so I might not have much room to argue with it. Give it a shot if you need the Book of Mormon handy on your Kindle, it might work better for you."
1,Kindle product - VERY DISAPPOINTING,"You cannot navigate this product to chapter and verse. So in the Kindle, you have to make the print really small and then turn the pages, one by one, to get to the place you are looking up."
2,audible format poor,"I thought that listening to the Book of Mormon may be helpful. However, the speaker repeats each verse number 2X prior to reading verse. It is very distracting and redundant. I thought at first there was a defect but apparently this is the format. I would not suggest this purchase, hopefully, another audible version will be on the market shortly."
2,The Book of Mormon,I wanted to read this book because the play is so popular. I was disappointed because it was hard to read. Some of the stories within it is almost like the bible.
5,changed my life,Fantastic book. It is true. I love this book with all of my heart. It has changed my life and the lives of my family members.
5,This book has changed my life. I recomend it to everyone.,"This book has changed my life in so many ways, that it is incredible. It is the BEST book avalible to man."
3,Interesting read,"With the election approaching, I wanted to decide which person would be the best pick. I kept getting angry with Romney because he kept changing his mind, so I thought I would research his core beliefs. This was a good insight of his core beliefs, morals, etc. I feel now I can make an educated choice....."
2,A better attempt to explain Christianity (than the Bible),"Has some interesting symbolism especially about unbelievers and a few interesting stories. But the bulk of the book is repetition of two basic themes: the negative theme: we are all sinners in need of redemption and the positive theme: God loves us all and will save us if we want to be saved. These are presented in numerous mostly dull preachings and depictions of unbelievers and believers. This book will fascinate some people, make others very uncomfortable, and be boring to many people. I would recommnd it mostly to study the tailoring of Christianity to meet modern spiritual needs."
5,The most TRUE and CORRECT book on the face of the earth.,"The Book of Mormon is Another testament of Jesus Christ as written by the people of the American continent. It was translated off of Gold Plates by Joseph Smith and is the basis of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and is an outstanding book for anyone to read.To recieve a FREE COPY of the Book of Mormon, visit http://www.lds.com or CALL TOLL FREE 1-888-537-7111"
1,A load of shate!,"This book is a crock of shate! Whoever wrote this was not from biblical times, and people should know that this book denounces black people as being occursed!"
3,Don't fear the truth--read and decide,"My brother once took his BofM into a Baptist Bible meeting, and one of the Baptists--a young women--nearly went apoplectic when she saw it. Believe me when I tell you there is NO NEED FOR FEAR. This is a very important book, and needs to be examined carefully and calmly.This book details the journey of a family from Jerusalem to the New World, where, hundreds of years later, they are visted by Jesus. Is it literally true? Is it merely a complex, extensive metaphor? Is it totally bogus? Read for yourself and decide. I personally have read the book, and my own conclusion is that it is not literally true, although it does contain moral elements with which I deeply agree.So open your mind a little and put this book to the test; you won't be worse off for it. No one should be so hysterically insecure about his or her religion convictions as to not at least look at it."
2,mormons,The book of Mormon is so ridiculous that reading it was a chore. How any thinking person could accept this as true and truly holy is beyond me.
1,"Mark Twain, from ""Roughing It"" pg. 102","""All men have heard of the Mormon Bible, but few except the ""elect"" have seen it, or, at least, taken the trouble to read it. I brought away a copy from Salt Lake. The book is a curiosity to me, it is such a pretentious affair, and yet so ""slow,"" so sleepy, such an insipid mess of inspiration. It is chloroform in print. If Joseph Smith composed this book, the act was a miracle keeping awake while he did it ...""And it came to pass"" was his pet. If he had left that out, his Bible would have been only a pamphlet."""
1,If Anyone Adds,"The Bible is a book of dispensation or periods of time and no reference is made of the future events stated in the Book of Mormon. Revelation 22:18 I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues which are written in this book;"
1,Religious curiosity not convincing,This is not too readable as it wanders and yet it is fussy but similar and somewhat shorter than the Bible even if it lacks the depth of God's love for mankind
1,Of all the books I've read...,"I would say the Book of Mormon is far and away the worst. It's poorly conceived and poorly executed. Fantastic stories are interspersed with plagiarized Bible passages. I have an 1830 copy, and you wouldn't believe how much the text has been altered since then. The first edition has the structure of an inferior dime novel, while the present edition looks like a wanna-be Bible for uneducated people. How this obvious fraud can be believed by millions is baffling. Recommended use: doorstop."
3,Smith versus Moses,"I tried to understand the philosophy behind this book, but I really could not understand why a Mr. Smith could assert to be a parallel of Moses. I appreciate the style of living and good works that present day Mormons do, but I am afraid that that is as fire I can arrive."
3,its ok,"its ok cause out of 3 bulbs that i ordered, 2 were broken. i was able to salvage this one from the box. the box was not damaged but the person who packed the bulbs did not do a good job at it, hence the broken bulbs.. the seller lacks communication skills and i would NEVER recommend the seller to anybppdy. right now i am still with 2 bulbs or a refund.. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME. SHOP AROUND FOR SOMEONE WHO ACTUALLY BELIEVES IN GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SATISFACTION"
1,Really bad,"To be fair, I havent actually listened to this album. I have however, seen Azita in concert. After seeing her play, I think it's safe to say that this album is profoundly bad. Just awful. Painful. I'm getting light-headed just recalling the experience.If you want to listen to some extraordinarily lousy vocals accompanied by piano, drums and a bass, pick this album up."
1,"Noise, noise, noise!","This ground loop isolator made absolutely zero difference. When I connected a different brand of ground loop isolator, everything was fine. Stay away from the Raptor unless you like to waste your money."
1,does not work,"It did not eliminate the ground loop in my application. It just made the music sound terrible.Not recommended, buy a quality ground loop isolator."
2,Didn't Solve My Problem,"I took a chance and purchased the Raptor GL15 ground loop isolator in the hope that it would reduce or even eliminate the buzzing sound I have in the right speaker of my newly purchased Memorex 3-CD changer, tape, radio and turntable unit. Unfortunately, all it did was reduce the volume to the speakers, so I couldn't hear anything. It was only $10 so I guess I'm not out much money. But if you have a similar audio unit, don't think this ground loop isolator will cure a similar problem."
4,Fixed my Hum and Buzz,I had an awful Buzz and Hum coming from my Computer into my mixer . This product fixed the issue.Here is a Video Review of the Product [...]
4,"Works decent""""","I had some noise in my speakers after i installed a new cd player,amp and speakers.My buddy said these will help and he was right.They did take away most of the noise but not all.There is a faint bit of noise but not enough to even notice it unless your listening for it.I connected it to the amp not the cd deck which is the best way to get most of the noise out.I didnt give it a 5 because it didnt take it all away.Also i didnt notice any loss of sound at all.A good buy."
2,Not Exactly What I Was Looking For,"Ok, I purchased this item because I had my iPod connected via headphone jack to aux-input in my G35. I also had an iPod car-charger connected as well which caused very noticeable (not to mention very annoying) hum. I read that this would fix that.It did!!! BUT... I swear it took some of the bass along with it. Or at least, my songs no longer had that vivid sound anymore. Which kind of makes sense to me now. Why did I spend ""x"" amount of money on a Monster brand cable to connect my iPod when that same cable had to be connected to this $15 ground loop? It seemed as if there were too many connections being made. I went ahead and bought a Monster car-charger just to try it out and surprisingly, the hum is gone and the ""vividness"" and bass of my music remains.I am not a Monster fanboy. I just want to say, ""Sometimes, you do get what you pay for""."
1,Ruined my sound as well.,"It got rid of all the noise that was coming out through my speakers, engine whine, static, everything, but it also makes my actual sound coming out of the speakers muffled too.. like I am listening to it through a telephone."
1,Disappointed.,"I bought 3 of these things thinking that they could solved the ground loop problems that I have through my Home stereo receiver, & they honestly didn't do anything for me @ all. They actually made the ground loop louder, & they also made sound quality FAR worse. These things will thin out your sound & make everything sound completely lackluster. But I give these particular isolators a benefit of a doubt, because maybe I didn't use them the right way. I never turned off the power completely on my stereo, then turn it back on to see if they will work that way so I may have to try that. Maybe I bought the wrong thing for my needs [these may work in your car much better, so I must take notice of that as well]. But for that time I've had them, They have done nothing to improve my issues...."
3,It's eliminates the ground loop... but it also flatens tone,"I used 2 of these in my Honda Element because I just installed a new stereo with a 750 watt Infinity amp. My head unit is a Pioneer AVIC-Z2 andit has a lot of ground noise coming through the sub and rear outputs. I tried everything to get rid of it, but nothing worked. I tried the Raptor GL15 as a last resort and it knocked all the ground noise out. Unfortunately, it also knocked some of the tone out. It sounded flat. I was frustrated.I took another chance and tried the PAC SNI1 and it worked much better. I can't tell if there is any tone loss, so I'm satisfied with it. It costs a little bit more, but in my experience the PAC works better on a system that uses a lot of watts."
5,works as advertised,"This unit works as advertised, and it's cheaper than Radio Shack's version of the same product (catalog # 270-054). Plus, it comes with male RCA jacks at one end and female RCA jacks at the other - better for most applications than Radio Shack's male-male cables."
1,Targeted for the Mediocre Gay Crowd,"A bore. A complete bore. This offering by Bast undermines the book he concocted years ago supposedly dealing with James Dean, even then a self-serving proposal. This one is practically worthless if you want to discover more of James Dean. This dreary offering is about Bast coming out of the closet. Ho-hum...Who in the world cares? Save your money; this is a mediocre book written by a mediocre writer, if he's even that. What a bore!"
4,James Dean's boyfriend writes,"Engaging and detailed recounting of the James Dean's life from the perspective of his roommate and lover. UCLA begins the tale that ends with the effects of Dean's tragic death on the author and others. If you are looking for salacious recounting of sexual encounters, you will not find it here. If you are interested in Dean's true life from the perspective of someone close, you will enjoy the book. Having read several bios of Dean's life, some with graphic details of gay encounters, I found this one more interesting and descriptive of the complex person Dean was."
1,weak writer,"Best may be a successful screen writer, but that doesn't translate to good book writing. This is mostly a biography of the author, and you will learn little of James Dean that you don't know already. The book is mostly about Best, and it is pretty vapid, superficial, gay guy reading. There are homosexuals, and there are flamboyant gays, and Best is the latter. James Dean, who may or may not have been homosexual, was definitely not gay. There is not a lot to write about a life that was cut so short and that lived so little. The young man was a giant, but you will find little insight to that mystic in this book."
2,Fun Internet sites don't always make great books,"Edward Winter is familiar to on-line students of chess history through his long-running column at chesscafe.com. This book continues the tradition of chess scholarship he has shown there and in his similar book ""Kings, Commoners and Knaves,"" but this time the effect, sad to say, is beginning to wear old. The problem is not that the material is ill-researched -- quite the contrary, it's as meticulously turned out as usual for Winter -- or uninteresting -- that's in the eye of the beholder. In all simplicity, it's that snippets and sound bites may be fine for a web site, but they don't make for a very good book. The free-ranging, vignette-oriented style characteristic of Winter's on-line column does not translate well into book form, creating a work that is disjointed to the point of being hard to read."
4,The Survivor In Us All,"The book ""The Survivor In Us All"" was a heart-filled story written by Erna F. Rubinstein. She was a teenager during the Holocaust. Erna and her family were sent to many different concentration camps. This book helps you understand the reality of the camps. Her writing in the book was very descriptive. At times her writing was so detailed that it felt like you were right there with her. She opens up her heart in the book and her true feelings show through. I recommend this book to anyone interested in reading about true stories of Holocaust survivors. I really enjoyed this book."
2,Doesn't Do The Job,"I bought this in hopes of using a 20-year-old monitor to test some 30-year-old 8-bit ISA VGA cards. I'd read reviews of similar adapters (with the genders reversed) that users had applied to just that purpose, but unfortunately this one failed to serve that function. I think this may be a serial adapter rather than a VGA adapter as the description states, because it does pass some signal, but I haven't been able to get usable video with it."
2,Very dissapointing,"I bought this scooter for my six year old,unfortunately some nuts fell apart roughly 4 months after, all efforts to fix it prove abortive. I really like the features, but it did not last."
3,Just a huge huge huge warning...,"My daughter broke her arm, and needed surgery, while trying to ride this scooter.I'm not blaming the scooter or the company...I am just sending some advice so other parents don't have to spend 3 days in the hospital and 6 weeks of their summer with a child in a cast!YES... it was an accident but my daughter was literally standing still and just trying to balance and she fell over on her elbow.THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU BUY THIS FOR PRESCHOOL AGED CHILDREN!!!!Now I know why they make scooters with 2 wheels in the back.Young kids just can't balance on these !!!Save these types of scooters for ages 6 and up!!!!!!!!!!"
5,a little girls dream,"""Thank you Mommy, I love my scooter"" is what I hear multiple times a day. She loves the Barbie colors and design and has learned quickly how to use it. She just pushes with one foot and rides around with such a smile. It folds up easily for storage or travel. Couldn't imagine another scooter making her happier. She completes the look with her Barbie helmet and her Barbie protective pads."
3,Not Required,"Item came as shown. I bought it because all of the reviews I read said it was needed. I have a Sirius Onyx, and the FMDA25 installed on a 2005 Ford E150 and I did not need this item to install the FMDA25 as the cables on the unit are a perfect fit for the Ford antenna connections."
5,2003 Ford Taurus SE,Exactly what I needed and it worked perfectly once I plugged the FM Modulator in.
1,Not Compatible with Focus,"The Amazon description says it should work, the packaging it comes in says it should work, but the antenna connection on the back of my 2003 Focus is much larger. The radio does not recieve a standard antenna plug, either, so I'm still looking for one that works. Im sure this item works fin if it's applied to the right vehicle."
3,Right ISO mount and wrong color,"Though it says Sand (color of ISO kit) on the package, its not. The color what I got matches with Scosche NN1495STB instead of NN1495SDB.I have returned the item."
3,"Cute, but does not stay down well","Very pretty in our nursery, but folds and moves very easily. Even when we have it anchored under the rocking chair, it still scrunches and folds, making it a bit of a tripping hazard. If you had hard wood, you could put a non-skid pad underneath without too much trouble, but for a carpeted room, not the greatest."
2,not the 'totalizing' read i was looking for,"i left this book with a feeling of disappointment. the author doesn't seem to understand that for extraordinary claims, you need extraordinary evidence. certainly the claim that civilization is bad is extraordinary, but the scholarship in this book isnt strong enough to back up this claim. Zerzan could use some rhetoric 101 training in drawing decisive conclusions, as all he does in this book is establish a correlation between the rise of civilization and inequality, etc. but correlation is not causation.its pretty muddled thinking in my estimation, and not really worth reading unless you have to deal with the green anarchy cult."
5,Wonderful interviews!,Interview sessions that take you out of the box....a must have for true Celtic fans.
3,For Bread Alone.,"In general I liked the story, but there were way too many curse words and such woven into it. In a world where cursing and cussing and downright foul language has become comon place, for my part, I certainly do not want them to appear, to such an extend, in the book I am reading."
4,Great product!,"Everything works great. The sound is very clear and crisp for both music and phone. My only problem is they are a bit bulky. If they were able to fold up for ease of carry, they would be perfect."
1,Terrible packaging,"Packaging arrived with no box, nor any instructions. I would not recommend this to anyone ordering from this seller, as they usually send it slow mail and takes forever to get to you, my package took 3 weeks to arrive. I will certainly not be buying from this seller ever again, nor will my peers!"
1,bad package,I received the item but had a small slit so the coffee was very old tasting what a waste of money. :(
4,Very Aromatic and Great Flavor,"Wonderfully areomatic and nice full flavor. A bit expensive, so I am on the fence about using this as our daily brew."
3,Taste does not match the price,"For as expensive as this is, it's kind of a disappointment. There is no ""wow"" factor in this kona coffee. It was just OK, not what I expected for the price I paid. Never again will I pay this much for something I have not sampled."
5,I Just Had To...,"...I've never written a product review before, but this is such amazingly good coffee I just had to say so. From the first sip I knew this was coffee like I had never tasted before. And in Seattle - where coffee falls from the sky like so much rain - that's saying something. I had planned to serve this as the perfect cap for a recent dinner party with friends, but it didn't last in my house long enough to make the dinner. So I'm back for more.Now I'm wondering if the folks at Hawaii Roasters have any openings. I work cheap...you can pay me in these wonderful, rich coffee beans!"
3,Not exactly what I expected,"I bought this coffee after reading the reviews. I was disappointed. EVERYONE seemed to think this coffee was wonderful. I certainly would not rate it bad, but OK--not exactly what I was anticipating.UPDATE: I received an e-mail from the president of Hawaiian Roasters, the company that makes this coffee. Since I was not totally satisfied with the coffee, I was given a full refund. While this coffee is not my favorite, I will say the company makes a great effort to satisfy the customer. Thank you, Mr. Krant."
3,"Kona is the best, but this isn't the best Kona","I've had several types of Kona, and this one doesn't rank anywhere near the top.It's not bad, by any means. Kona is my favorite coffee by far, and I'd rather have this than grocery store beans. However, I've had Koa brand and Kona Mountain, plus Kona from Seattle Coffee purchased at CostCo, and they all beat this Hawaii Roasters. They're all about the same price too, some more and some less.Kona tends to be subtle, but this was so subtle I'd have to call it a bit bland. Perhaps the darker roast would bring out a bit more flavor. I normally get medium roast for Kona to avoid the burnt overtones which can mask Kona flavor, but there just doesn't seem to be that much flavor here to begin with.I noted another review that also complained about the blandness, and it's from roughly the time I bought mine. Given some of the other glowing reviews, I wonder if I just got a substandard batch."
2,Mediocre at best...,"Well, I have to stay that I was very disappointed in this coffee. I typically buy whole bean coffee from a local company, and I gotta say that I really enjoy that moment when I break the seal on the bag, and get that rich coffee aroma. So, always hearing that Kona coffee is the best in the world, I really expected a great experience from this - however that wasn't the case.When I opened the bag, there was virtually no coffee aroma. I don't know if it's been sitting in a warehouse too long (expiration date on back was July 2011 - it's April 2011 as of this writing). The vacuum seal seemed okay - no tears in the packaging; so I'm at a loss to explain why the coffee seemed 'stale' . And after brewing my first pot, I gotta say it isn't a great cup of coffee. At best, it's a mediocre cup of coffee."
2,average...KONA 100%?????,If you think your going to get that awesome full flavor and aroma you bought in a coffee shop in Kona forget it. If you add the cost of this stuff(Hawaii Rosters) you can do better. It's just OK and is not worth the price IMO.
1,"Burnt and Stale, Not Medium Roast as Advertized","These allegedly medium roast Kona beans are stale and burnt like Starbucks roasts (Starbucks roasts their coffee just to the burnt stage in order to hide the fact that their beans are rancid), not a medium roast at all.I strongly suspect that these beans are a few years old that were re-roasted, re-packaged, and sold on Amazon as fresh Kona beans.When I opened the package, it smelled more like a chimney or an ash tray than a coffee.I am very disappointed."
2,Kona coffee,"I say Kona coffee is over promoted and overpriced. The taste is way short of a great coffee.I cannot bring a well-balance taste out of this coffee no matter how I brew it. Don't waste your $$$!Cross my heart, there are other excellent coffees which cost less than Kona."
4,"Award Winning Farm Roasted 100% Kona Coffee, Whole Bean, Medium Roast, 1 Lb","Delicious for what it is, being prepackaged...considering that it is not fresh roasted in your kitchen. Expensive as a full time enjoyment, but a nifty treat or gift."
2,Really bad coffee,"I bought this coffee so I wouldn't have to go out of my way to go to a specialized coffee shop. Big mistake. This is not strong, flavorful coffee, which is what I expect from 100% Kona. These beans taste like they've been sitting around in a warehouse for months, which is probably the reality. This is a waste of money, you are better off with Starbucks beans."
2,Very disappointed,"Got this coffee expecting good things as I had thoroughly enjoyed Kona blends before and wanted to ""upgrade"" to real Kona beans but was very disappointed in this particular product as it had almost no flavor. Just to be sure it wasn't just me I shared the beans with other coworkers who agreed it was short on taste/flavor and were surprised that it was ""high dollar"" Kona coffee beans. I started mixing it w/Gevalia and Starbucks to get some taste and that way it won't be a total loss. Maybe I got a bad batch or old coffee but I am not taking a chance on this product again."
4,"Very good, but not great","This was a gift for my husband, who loves Kona coffee. I don't drink coffee myself. He said it was very good, but not the best he'd ever had."
3,Good Coffee but expensive,"This is the first time I splurged on full Kona coffee. I have been curious on how good this coffee would be. It is very good coffee but this will be he last time I buy it. For the cost, it is not worth it. Amazon sells some great coffee for half the price of this one. If you have unlimited cash flow than go for it as it is good and very smooth."
2,not impressed,i had always heard about kona coffee and finally decided to try it.these beans were dry with no noticeable oil.as such the coffee was bland and lifelessi havent tried kona coffee since; good luck!!!2/5
1,Disappointed,"We have had great kona coffee before, but this was very disappointing. It lacked flavor and we can't recommend it. Maybe we had a bad batch, but we threw it away."
3,Not worth the price,I love coffee and have some good krona coffees. This isn't one off them. It's just very dull and flavorless
2,What's the taste of Kona like?,"Maybe I am a taste disaster. I could not tell any difference between Kona and ordinary blend coffee.I mostly drink Starbucks espresso or Starbucks Sumatra. Since I feel that Starbucks espresso tastes better than this product, I'd rather go back on Starbucks espresso. Also my friend agrees with me about the taste of Kona coffee.Please tell me what the taste of Kona is like!!!"
5,Great tasting coffee,"Like most coffee drinkers, I know Kona is a special coffee bean, and this brand offers great taste. At my local coffee shop, I often pick Kona when it is offered as the flavor of the day. While the coffee shop Kona is better than an average coffee, it did not seem to be anything special, and I could guess they do not sell true Kona, but a blend. So I decided to try a true 100% Kona and picked Hawaiian Roasters. I am very happy with this purchase---might be the best coffee I have ever had. The flavor is strong and there is no after-taste issue. I picked the medium roast and I plan to try the dark roast next."
4,"Smooth, flavorful, and pricey","Treated ourselves for Christmas to see what everyone raves about Kona coffee. Bought whole medium roast beans and milled just before brewing to discover the java to be nicely smooth, flavorful and enjoyable. The price, however, doesn't quite justify the marginally-better product. We probably won't buy this again - maybe try Blue Mountain Jamaican java next time !?"
3,Medium roast - dissapointing,"Last Christmas, I received a supply of the dark roast Kona. I am a darker roast coffee drinker for the most part. I was very impressed with the dark roast. In fact I thought it was some of the best coffee I had ever had. I even added some to my regular grinds and found that the improvement was very noticeable and it extended the supply. I tried the medium roast to compare, but was disappointed. The medium roast did not provide the same rich flavor, it was barely better than my regular at 3 times the cost. I'm going back to the dark next time."
5,WOW! I can say it backwards !WOW.,THIS IS THE REAL STUFF. HANDS DOWN THE BEST COFFEE SINCE I MUGGED A DEALER IN KINGSTON. HOW ELSE DO YOU GET BLUE MOUNTAIN WHEN IT IS ALL SOLD TO TOKYO. True Kona aroma and taste. I will be back.
3,Not what I was expecting,"Like many product review readers, I take all negative feedback with a grain of salt since people are more apt to write a review when they have a negative experience. I however should have listened to the negative feedback.As an avid coffee drinker, I had ordered several other highly rated coffee's from Amazon. I have always considered a genuine Kona coffee to be my favorite so I was a little disappointed when I ground up some beans and made myself a fresh cup.It is more bitter and less flavorful then I expected. Not a terrible taste, just not what I expected. For the price, I wouldn't recommend this coffee. There are many other less expensive; good coffee's out there."
3,Falls a bit bit short,"The packaging is exceptional. I really did like the re-sealable bag. I have been buying coffee from assorted vendors on Amazon for awhile now and with the Super Saver shipping and no sales tax it's been a worthwhile experience. I just wish the roasters would all consider packaging that allows the customers to store their products as well as HI Roasters. As for the coffee, it was very flavorful, a nice chocolate overtone. But for my tastes it fell short of some lower priced Kona blends I've had and I think it's due to the light roast. If you're into a more aromatic earthy taste w/ complex mellow undertones the Hawiian Dark Roast is among the very best."
2,Beware! Quantity Changed from 16 oz to 14 oz for the same price.,"I re-ordered Hawii Roasers Kona Coffee and found out the size has changed from 16 oz to 14 oz. The coffee is fine, but I do not appreciate the change. When I ""re-order"" I expect the same item, if not there should be notification.I will try other Kona distributors.Gerald"
3,A little disappointed,"Let me start by saying this is the first time I've had 100% Kona coffee (and was very excited to try it) so I'm not sure what it should taste like. However, I found that it was a little lacking in flavor. I know that it shouldn't be bitter, and it isn't. It is very smooth. I generally drink coffee with cream but this is good enough for me to forgo cream altogether. I just want more flavor. I've tried grinding more beans and finer grinds but it just seems like it should be ""stronger"". Maybe I just need to try the dark roast next time... At $30 per pound I don't know that I can justify the cost."
2,Very disappointing Kona,"I bought a pound of Kona to take on vacation. However, everyone who tasted it agreed that it was not good at all. It didn't even taste like Kona! Either it was a blend, or very old beans. Either way, there is no way that this coffee was 100% pure fresh Kona like I've had numerous times in Hawaii."
3,Expensive and not my favorite,"I expected to be blown away by the taste for the price of this coffee. Don't get me wrong...it smelled phenomenal!!! However, it just wasn't the best I have ever had. Sorry."
3,Underwhelmed,"About ten years ago, I bought an amazing roast of Hawaiian Kona at Trader Joe's. It was the, without a doubt, the best coffee I've ever tasted. It was a bit on the pricey side and way out of my budget back then. Recently (and I'm not sure why), I started remembering what an amazing roast that was so I went to Trader Joe's to splurge. Much to my dismay, they were out of it.I went online and did some research to find premier 100% pure Kona beans and ended up buying this one by Hawaii Roasters due to its positive reviews on Amazon. I was super excited to get this and ended up being incredibly disappointed. For almost $30 I expected something better but this was no more superior than the ""Kona blend"" I bought at Raley's for $10.It wasn't bad coffee but it wasn't great either. Mediocre and incredibly overpriced."
4,Great coffee but a what price,I love this coffee I am just not sure it is worth the price. I love Kona Coffee but at $30 a pound not sure I will be drinking it every day. I think there is great coffee that you can get for a fraction of the price.
5,Korean War vet in your family? This is fascinating!,"On Veterans Day 2010 my local paper featured a story about an old acquaintance, a WWII vet. It fired up my interest in my husband's service era, the Korean War. We had two books on our bookshelves about the War. The first didn't hold my interest. When I picked up this one I found it to be one of those books I just couldn't put down. It's very well-written and weaves together the author's very unusual and interesting life story, military history, and the politics of the time. There were photos in my copy of the author's family and friends. They satisfied the curiosity that comes of reading about these people."
5,"Excellent, True Story of Courage, Endurance, and Friendship","This true story of a young soldier during the Korean War time and after the war shows courage, pain, suffering, struggle, endurance, and friendship. I read the book in 5 hours. I couldn't put it down. When I came to the part in the book that explained the 3 day promise and the meaning behind the title of the book, I cried with such pain from a mother's heart. This book shows how we can make a difference for others that repays many times over. Many people who did not know the author trusted him and gave him opportunities that have allowed him to make a difference for so many others in his lifetime. Highly recommend for all readers 16 and above.Note: The author self published the book with his own funds and gave 100% of the profits to be used to build the Korean War Memorial in Washington, D.C."
1,bottle opener that doesn't,".Hard to get the lip of the bottle cap to catch on the opener. Have to ""hunt"" forr the lip to catch the bottle cap edge"
3,Awkward,This doesn't work as well as I'd hoped. It's cool and all but not nearly as functional as I'd expected... You have to turn the beer bottles around a bit to get the right leverage. I wouldn't expect much more than ornamental use from this item!
5,Great sound & Talent -- Diverse and expressive - Fabulous!,"I love this CD! In the car or at home, this CD has a song for every mood. Each song expresses a different emotion. Jazz, classical guitar, and even some Spanish influences. It is sexy, uplifting, fun & romantic. A great use of accompanying instruments and sounds. Joesf Glaude is a wonderfully talented individual; I can't wait until another CD comes out!"
1,Does not stick -,I followed directions and put it under my car. I got an email to review the product a few weeks later and thought to look to make sure it was still there.. The key pouch fell off and was laying on the ground under the car... Good thing I looked. The product is a POS.
1,Absolute Garbage,I bought this DVD-Rom because it was on sale. I regret buying this drive. It has ridiculous load times and it takes the drive around 30 seconds to eject a disc. I no watch DVDs on my computer because this drive seemed to have messed up a couple of my DVDs. Definetly do not buy this piece of garbage.
3,Not a Shirley Temple movie,"This VHS tape is marketed and sold as a Shirley Temple film, when in fact, the movie was made at Paramount prior to Shirley's star days at 20th Century Fox. It really is a Gary Cooper and Carole Lombard film, which is the reason why I bought it. Cooper is young, extremely charming and very handsome. Likewise, Carole Lombard (yet to find the signature persona of her screwball comedy era at this point) is pretty and likable. This was well worth the few dollars I paid for it. I don't know if it is available on DVD at this point but if it is, it wouldn't be part of the Shirley Temple 20th Century Fox box sets. Since it is one of the 700 or so films that Paramount sold to Universal for television distribution many years ago, no doubt that it would be a Universal Home Video release."
2,Poor Shirley,"Shirley does a wonderful job in this film although there aren't really any flashy song and dance numbers-- you can see her acting talent shine through as she cries after discovering the jewels in her little teddy bear. One of Shirley's earlier films it is one of her better ones.But, sadly it was ruined by the horrible acting done by the melodramatic acting of her father and her mother in this movie. I felt rather sad for little Shirley for I felt like I was watching child abuse in every scene Shirley was with her father. Not only is her father a liar and a jewel thief but, he seems to have no connection or love for Shirley compared to her many other on screen dads (James Dunn). Really a lack of chemistry is what ruins this film.But, this film will want to make you cry so I give it only two stars- for when you see a Shirley film you really want a film with classic values and one that will make you want to sing and dance instead of persecute child abusers."
3,A Charming Little Book,"Reverend Edington has written a charming little Christian book about Joseph, the long neglected member of the Jesus family. As a ""christian"" book it has many virtues, but as an historical account of Joseph it leaves a great deal to be desired. Hence the rating - 5 stars if you're looking for that charming little Christian book and 1 star if you want to know who Joseph really was.Edington makes unfounded presumptions (e.g., Joseph was ""dark, his beard thick, his hair full and curly..."") and errors (e.g., The Jewish people would ""not have been shocked by something as comparatively simple as a virgin birth; Mary would have been required to go to Bethlehem for the census, etc.), yet he does it all in an unassuming charming manner that you tend to forgive him his trespasses.It's well written, short, and poignant. Just don't think it's history."
2,average,while I dig Jody Watley it's been a long time since I've felt a Album by Her all the way.I still dig Her&Andre Cymone's Projects.this Set has some pretty good stuff but not enough to keep my interest for a whole set.I dig Her Older stuff far more.but the Production&overall vibe here just doesn't fully feel like Jody to me.
3,A bit of a bland one from Jody,"I was a big Shalamar fan and have liked some of Jody's work from the 90's (""Off the Hook"" & ""I'm the one you need"" spring to mind).I bought this on the basis of it being the source for the UK single ""Photograph"" - which is great. That, however, was remixed for domestic release and the original version that appears here is less strong. If you also already own the previously released ""Love to Love"" and ""Saturday Night Experience"" the rest of what you get here is a bit wishy washy. Nice production but rather bland musically. The best tracks being the ones I already had.Jody has a great voice and can still do fantastic music with the right production teams but this is just inoffensive."
2,Not her best,"For a while, during every song, I mostly enjoyed the music. But like a majority of dance music, I get bored with the repetitive lyrics and the looping. It's a good cd to shuffle in your player and clean your house."
5,A little bit Jody for you,"Okay so this is only available on expensive import, but it is worth your time and money. Jody doing what Jody has done best all her (long and distinguished) career, good songs, great performances. Try it you'll like it and then come back for 'Saturday Nght Experience' or I'll eat my hat."
5,She's Back....,Jody is back in fine form with this new CD. It's truly a breath of fresh air in today's music scene. Very jazzy and ambient at times. The best CD I've purchased all year.....
4,Another great album from Jody!,"Last year, I went crazy when I saw Jody Watley's album in the stores that I got it! This still shows Jody at her finest! Very funky songs with shades of electronica throughout the album. And she actually pulls it off! It does have that moody, mellow feel on some songs. I love that title song with its reflective breaks before jumping back to its throbbing basslines and the All I Wanna Do is Just Dance chorus. Whenever and I Love To Love are also great. But Clouds has this very funky beat to it and is one of Jody's best songs. Some artists fade off after some 25 years of making songs--their quality slips a bit. Not Jody! More than two decades in the music game, she's still got it as an artist and she still looks good and sexy to this day! Her willingness to try new things is very well felt on this album, and she is superior all throughout!"
1,DEFECTIVE PRODUCT,"I INSTALLED TWO OF THESE ON MY 1999 PLYMOUTH PROWLER TODAY 3-10-2012 THEY DO NOT WORK, WILL NOT HOLD HOOD UP OR EVEN HELP LIFT IT. DO NOT ORDER THESE PRODUCTS. I AM RETURNING TO AMAZON.COM FOR FULL CREDIT.STRUTS BAD, AMAZON GREAT.THANKS,GARY"
3,Suprisingly weak straps,"3.0 out of 5 stars Not an Ironman Watch, February 8, 2009By Poi Dog ""Pro Deo"" (East and West Coast) - See all my reviewsI purchased this watch because of Nike's reputation and the sale price at the time (43). From May to October the watch was perfect. Didn't get scratched even when I really hit the glass against a wall or metal. I lift weights, run, swim and play many sports and the watch was holding up great until one day the end of one strap where the clasp is, just ripped and the metal clasp fell out. Now the watch is useless and the weakness of the strap is very apparent now. It was sent to repair but I have a feeling they are going to charge more than half the purchase price just for the end of one strap."
5,Yardley Brillantine,I am an old user of Yardley Brillantine. Sometime ago I was disapointed to verify that Amazon was not carrying this product and I needed to buy it in England. Now I was able to get it with You and I am very glad. I hope that in the future I allwais will find the Brllantine at Amazon. As a matter of fact this is one of the best products I know for fixing the hair.
4,Naughty little rabbit.,This is one of the funniest books I have read as a child and that I read to my children. It is about a rabbit whole boops animals on the head and is given three chances by the goo fairy to change. If he doesnt he gets turned into a goonie. Well little nauty rabbit foo foo doesnt listen and ends up being a goonie. Great pictures and theme that can be played like a song.
5,my girls' favotie,Both my girls enjoyed this book so much it became a family favorite. Also a book fun for a parent to read. Lively pace. Highly recommend.
5,Forever Casablanca,I love the Book and I was so happy to get it on time and in wonderful condtion as well. I would buy form this seller again. Thank you Angela Miller
4,addictive--except for the price,"mmmmmmm. Love this balm. Smells divine and makes skin velvety and fragrant without being oily. How do they do that? Has created for me an interest in all decleor products. I understand why it is pricy- all those delicious ingredients, I just hate to be hooked on this (now essential) non-essential."
1,Upgrading makes your opd files unreadable,"While I was dazzled with the improved OCR accuracy, that can't make up for it silently making my old opd files unreadable. It is no good to read in the readme after installing that Omnipage 15 can only read files created in 15 and 14. Since the install process located version 11 on my machine, it *knew* it was going to make me unable to look at my previous research scans, and could have warned me that this version is not capable of reading my files!This is not a new company, and while I admit I could have hunted for a readme on the CD before installing, to destroy customer access to their previous work files is not acceptable. Note that this is an UPGRADE version. The ability to import documents from the earlier versions is an absolute must!"
2,Caution!,"I purchased OmniPage 15 directly from Scansoft and got a special price because I owned another of their products. It has been a nightmare. First, it doesn't want to install all its parts and the PDF Create installer launches when ever you try to open a file...any file. It completely hosed my HP printer/scanner/fax/copier and then started to change my file icons.My system is virus free and had been very stable. I run at least 4 antipest programs in addition to both a hardware and software firewall. I also am a computer professional. I have never experienced such a miserable performance from a major piece of software from a reputable house. I couldn't even uninstall it! To their credit the tech support is friendly, based in Florida and they try to help but...I can't be spending hours per week doing what the developers should have done in the first place.I'll be returning my rights and asking for a refund."
2,Little to add,"For someone who ""ate, drank, smoked, and talked with the Beatles daily, and shared some very close personal moments with them,"" the author doesn't have much to say about his experiences, and what little he does have to say is superficial and unrevealing. Original material is scant: the bulk of the book consists of reprints of 1966 articles from teen magazines, redundant contemporary newspaper accounts, and (often inaccurate) fan reminiscences. I can't say there was anything substantial here I hadn't already read dozens of times before."
1,Like nails on a chalkboard,"I bought this album shortly after it was released, knowing nothing about The Urban Griot. The album was, and still remains, a complete disappointment. The Urban Griot possesses less-than-amateur rhyming skills; sometimes spitting offbeat lyrics. If he had stuck to spoken word, this album might have been tolerable, as the production isn't half-bad. Rapping just isn't Omar Tyree's forte. He's a good storyteller, but a horrible musician."
4,Jazz Tree Poster,"The poster was for my daughter-in-law and I have not seen it myself. However, she is very happy with it."
2,Be careful!,"My grandson loves the way it looks and has no trouble with the little amp, but we haven't been able to get it tuned at all! Other reviews had suggested that it might be hard to keep in tune, but we assumed it could be tuned.J. Reynolds Mini Double Cutaway Electric Guitar Prelude Pack - Rockin' Red"
1,Save yourself some time and do not buy this,"Hello, I bought this for my 5 year old nephew because he is very interested in learning to play guitar. I did receive it promptly and well packed from Amazon. There are several problems with this guitar and it is not playable.When I received it the first thing I noticed was that the paint finish of the guitar was peeling off. No big deal for a cheap $[...] guitar but that was the least of the problems.1.) It does not stayed tuned at all for more than 1-2 strums/picks.2.) All of the guitar strings had rust on them3.) The amplifier worked once and then it stopped workingI would not recommend buying this to teach a child... it does not work and it cannot be tuned."
2,Too expensive and a plot didnt deliver the Revolution,"I was hoping for something along the lines of John Ross' _Unitended Consequences_. I bought this overpriced read along with _Term Limits_ and found them both a waste of time. If you liked UC, you wont like this. Completely non-libertarian, to boot."
4,Left Behind: America's Public Schools,"Would a loving parent willingly allow her child's school to be permanently closed? Many parents do not realize that this fate already awaits them. In Saving Our Schools: The Case for Public Education, Saying No to ""No Child Left Behind,"" Ken Goodman and the other editors write about the effects of the ""No Child Left Behind"" Act of 2001. In this collection of research based essays, the editors argue that the act is a conservative movement which will lead to the privatization of the American school system. This book also covers the wide range of consequences the act will have on the public school system, the teachers, and the students. The editors also offer different methods of fighting against the act and its effects. I really enjoyed reading this book. It was easy to read and understand, and the authors supported all of their facts. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know what the real ""No Child Left Behind"" Act is all about."
5,ONE OF THE BEST HAIR BOOKS THAT I HAVE EVER READ,"THIS BOOK ""BEAUTIFUL BLACK HAIR REAL SOLUTIONS TO REAL PROBLEM"" IS ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS ON HAIR THAT I HAVE EVER READ. THIS BOOK IS A GEM.IT IS WELL WRITTEN,SIMPLE AND TO THE POINT. HE IS NOT SELFISH IN SHARING INFORMATION WITH WOMEN OH HOW TO PROPERLY CARE FOR OUR HAIR. I HAVE TRULY ENJOYED THE INFORMATION IT CONTAINS. THE ONLY THING I REGRET IS NOT HAVING A COPY OF IT BEFORE I NEARLY DESTROYED MY HAIR, BUT WITH THIS WEALTH OF INFORMATION,I KNOW MY HAIR WILL BEGIN TO IMPROVE. THANK YOU SHAMBOOSIE."
3,It is good for you if you have a perm/relaxed,I bought this book thinking the book was going to give me tips on how to take care of my hair. Well this book focus more on women with relax her than natural/pressed hair. BEWEAR of this book please if you get your hair pressed. Other wise for the women who have permed hair...this book is great for you.
1,Very disappointed,"I was very disappointed in the advice this book offered. The products discussed are products that are not widely used by african americans. In fact, I have tried them and they really dried my hair out. This book needs a major overhaul."
4,Good recommendations,"I like this book, it does exactly what it says, and it assists in hair care, specifically relaxed hair and how to properly apply a relaxer. I would recommend this book for those who are wondering why their hair is so damaged. However, I did not find the product recommendation useful. The products were not visibly affective on my hair, so it loosed a star. But overall it is a good book."
4,Heaven sent,This book has really helped me take better care of my hair. For the most part I have always been horrible at the whole hair thing. This book has helped me get on track. I use it as a reference guide alot of the time when I am in doubt. I love the section in the book that gives the hair dresser exact directions on how to perm my hair. It has been so helpful.
5,Excellent,I think this is an awesome guide for anyone doing their own hair at home or update some of our cosmetologist skills.
2,disappointing,"for those looking for a novel, this would be a good choice but if you are looking at beginners's guide on managing african hair step by step, look somewhere else. this book talks about the author's experiences, advice and sometimes history. it did not impress me. i didnt see much step by step instructional guides."
3,Just an ok book,Thought his book was more informative but there was alot of reworded paragraphs as well. Over all not a bad read.
4,Excellent reference book.,"I have had this book for a while. Although it pushes certain products, it is a very good reference book. I learned how to accurately neutralize relaxed hair. It also offer a regime on growing your hair in 24 month. The writing is pithy and it is a must read for any person with hair and even the bald as well. Go ahead buy and enjoy. :)"
5,A Must Have For People with Chemically Relaxed Hair,"I was surfing the net for a hair care book that would help me with my hair problems. I read the reviews for Beautiful Black Hair and ordered it. My hair was dry, brittle, and thinning in spots. I read Shamboosie's book and was so impressed with the information that it provided, it was hard to put it down. I finished it in one day. I ran out and purchased the products he recommended that same night and he is absolutely correct, the right products make a world of difference. I followed the formula's he recommended and saw results after the second treatment. My hair looks and feels so much better. He knocks no-lye relaxers and that's okay because I don't use it anyway. However, I do know people with very beautiful healthy hair that does. As he points out, the key to a great head of hair is conditioner, conditioner, conditioner. Definitely one of the best hair care books on the market especially for women or men with flat cell (kinky) hair."
5,Really informative series,I am a practicing artist and really enjoyed listening to other artists share themselves and their art in a very intimate and informative format.
1,Art:21: Art in the 21st Century (Season 3),"I was amazed that these artists made it to a show on television. The work was boarderline awful. The only interesting artist was the glass artist, I thought his work was well done. Most of the other artists were on a par with elementary school children, young elemtary school children. One artist went to the dollar store to buy colored plastic containers to hammer onto her art. Yuck!"
3,Wrong one but ok,"They sent us the wrong item, we ordered 2 cups with handles and we got 2 without. The lids are meant to be interchangeable with the cups with handles but they don't got on correctly. However, we like the beakers without handles, so that works ok."
1,Contains BPA,"The clear Gerber sippy cups (such as this one) contain BPA (the opaque ""Sip and Smile"" sippies are BPA free). BPA free brands include Born Free, Thermos and The First Years.(For those that missed the news reports - BPA is a chemical found in some plastics that a recent National Institutes of Health report indicated may be harmful, especially to infants.)"
3,i love these cups but they have changed.,"I had some cups like this I had bought 2 years ago that had measurments on the side, which I loved! I just assumed these did and they did not. I am going to contact Gerber and ask why they quit putting them on the side of the cup. I mean your making a cup for babies/toddlers why wouldnt you put measurements on the side????? are I breast feed and dont use bottles and these are the best cups I have found."
2,Dog Food Supplement,I was too lazy to go to my local PetSmart so I decided to buy this product as an add-on to be crumbled on top of my dog's food. This product is intended to be dog food - not as a supplement on top. My 50-poumd dog would simply eat around this product.
3,Too much info,"We were hoping the book would provide more ideas about how a child can appropriately express and deal with their anger or being mad. The book excessively addresses what can cause someone to get mad, but not enough solutions for our needs. The artwork was a bit too ""busy"" but could definitely spark some conversation. However, the content is geared to the age range listed in the description. Most of the solutions are suited to a child that is mature enough to stop themselves to talk it out. Again, the book is probably much more helpful to a child 6-8 years old."
3,good,Mad Isn't Bad is fun to read with kids. The book has nice illustrations and tight writing. There could be more focus on suggesting tips to kids on what to do to calm down when they are angry.
1,Don't bother with this one.,"Enough of the pop-psych! This book bores my kids. It also bores me. There's no plot, no story, nothing.So many children's books try to be self-help books that are geared for adults. Most kids don't need this and don't want this.I also disagree with the way the whole subject is handled in this book. One example, ""it's okay to be mad at God."" I don't want to teach that to my kids. This is just another one of those books with a message, no plot, no in-depth characters, and so forth.I once read that books that do not stir a child's imagination are a waste of time. This book is a waste of time. My suggestion - try to avoid all the self-help/pop pscyh trends, and go for the REAL books, books with a good story line."
1,I hate this disc,"I love smooth jazz and while there are a couple of slick instrumental jazz tracks, the rest is junk to me. If you want to be a music group that does vocals, then promote yourself as that. This disc has too many vocal tracks for me. I wasted my money on this disc and its a shame because Walter Beasley is a great jazz musician."
5,Going with the Flow,Mr Beasley this cd is in my car i play it to death to the seller thank you so much i brought this cd because i heard the title cut on my cable jazz channel now i am a fan forever.
5,Great Practice Exercise Book,This is an excellent book from which you can get large amount ideas from which I can derive new problems for students in my math classes.
5,PLEASE PAY ATTENTION!!!,"Having had the opportunity to experience the evolution of Supernatural's lyrical skills, and knowing what real Hip-Hop should sound like, I would seriously encourage everyone out there to cop this album!! The majority of what you hear on the radio today is GARBAGE! If you put Supernat onstage to battle any of the commercial MCs, (That's right! I said ANY of them!) the difference would be clearly shown. If you have a true and deep appreciation for Hip-Hop culture, you will not be disappointed with this one. Believe it."
1,pbs,"The advertised bookseller here is a liar. They do not have this book whatsoever, but have the penguin edition, i.e., an edition which is not a hardback book, does not have the two dialogues, and does not have the abovementioned translator."
1,Disappointed,"This video has minimal footage of actual conflict. Most of the video is soldiers talking about situations such as the danger of I.E.D's. There is no real back and fighting except for a short story in the begining with mostly talking of what happened. I was expecting to be engrossed in a documentary about the war in Iraq but found myself waiting for any excitement to begin and it never did. I'm not taking away from what these National Gaurdsmen did over there as soldier's , their probably all really good soldiers , they just lack in film making is all."
4,It took me two or three listens..,"...but now I love it. First time I listened to the CD, I hated it and wondered what the heck I'd bought. I must not have been paying attention! Really a pleasing group with good harmonies and pickers.Their sister joins them on one song 'The Lighthouse' prominently and I believe it's her in the background on others. A fair singer herself, she fits in the 'allowed to waver and warble a bit' category of bluegrass singers. Which is JUST fine!While perhaps not to the caliber of some other bluegrass musicians, this album contains some really enjoyable original and traditional melodies. 'Norma', 'Beautiful Brown Eyes', and 'Vern's Guitar' are my favorites. 'Vern's Guitar gets me crying each and every time. *dabs eyes*It's worth checking out, definetly."
5,awesome new bluegrass,"I listen to a lot of music & I have to say this is one of the best cds I've listened to, simply awesome. These guys are able to write great new bluegrass songs, not to mention doing great covers at their live shows. If you like bluegrass music,beautiful melodies & great voices don't pass on this wonderful cd. Can't wait for their new cd. Keep up the great jobs guys!"
2,A big disappointment,"Being a long standing fan of James Last and owning most of his Music DVDs.I found this DVD a very big disappointment! There is only 60 minutes of music on the disc which made up of the orchestra (unseen) playing 5 tracks (11Min) as background music to a documentry travelogue of James arriving back in Germany!! You then receive the next 8 tracks as the live Street concert with a duration of 36 mins, unbelievable!!?? The last track the ""Sabre Dance"" is played during the final credits orchestra not seen! The disc has a Bonus section?? which is made up of three numbers by the orchestra playing in a studio these three songs have a playing time of just over 9 minutes.Considering the cost of this DVD I personally believe it is a ripp off.The Warner Music Group of Germany should hold their heads in shame for releasing such a poor quality James Last dvd.Mal Scott Darwin Australia."
3,"It's gorgeous, but...","Cute stationery, cool stamp, nifty address book, but I used up all eight pieces of paper and ten envelopes the first day. What good is that?"
1,Utterly Disappointing,"I wish that I'd read a few reviews before buying this item. Maybe I would have saved myself some grief and money.The packaging was good on this box and it caught my eye directly but the contents were not at all as described in the write up on the back.The stickers were thin and cheap. The paper also, was very thin and too short for any practicle letter writing. Most disappointing however, was the lightning bolt stamp. It was more a broken line than anything else. It's too small and faint to use and plainly speaking is quite a joke.I love Harry Potter and have bought a lot of excellent items, but this was definitely not one of them."
3,It's so cool.,Do you know How I give this Harry Stationary kit 3 stars because It's so cool but It's have 8 pieces of paper it very very few HHHHH.
5,The Kids Liked It Too,"I showed this to my second/third grade class and they were enthalled! They got excited when they began seeing balloon characters they recognized. Then I watched it with extended family over the Thanksgiving holiday and everyone from the 1 and 1/2 year old to the 70+ year-old enjoyed it. There is amazing footage of early parades as well as behind the scenes shots of modern parades. The pace and the voice over are lively, which helps hold your interest. Well worth the price."
5,A Great Way to Keep a Journal of What You've Read,I've been keeping a reading journal since 1970 and have used a variety of readingjournals. This is one of my favorites. It is divided by the alphabet with a sectionfor each letter. You can arrange your entries alphabetically by book titles or byauthors' names. There is also an intricate drawing for each letter that takes upone whole page.At the end of the book there is a short section for books borrowed and miscellan-eous. There is also an envelope/pouch at the end of the book where you canstore clippings or articles. I wish this journal was still in print as I'd buy anotherone.
5,Fantastic Journal,This journal was a Book of the Month Club selection in 1987. It's a great book to keep track of all the books you have read. I've been using mine since 1989. Have looked for other ones and have not found one as good as this. I have used mine so many years I have it taped. Would love to see it in print again.
2,Disappointing,"Published in 1995 before he became the Israeli Prime Minister, Netanyahu begins this book with a most rational and considered perspective, but by mid-way the discussion degenerates into historically ""enemy"" bashing. Possibly written to muster ""hard-line"" support for the election, this book unfortunately adds little to the debate, even though it would be hard to argue that he is not one of the leading contributors to the topic."
1,Temp Fix item only,"I ordered and installed this part a year ago (Dec 2011). It wasn't the same size as the original part I was replacing (too small), but my mechanic made it fit using an extra large bolt.Then, after about a month, it started rusting. My mechanic assured me that was normal enough, even though the original part wasn't rusted when it broke (after 10 years of service).Today, less than a year later, the weld that holds the upper attachment to the muffler strap (visible in the product picture) just broke. So now I have to choose between waiting for my mechanic to find a reputable part, or fast-order this questionable one from Amazon and hope it lasts longer.I suggest you use this item as a last resort."
2,Low quality.,"Product arrived on time, but it was the wrong shape, triangle instead of oval. Had to work the metal into shape to make it usable, but even then, the bolt it came with was too short (or the metal strap was too short). Using a longer bolt, this product did eventually do the job. Wish I'd paid more for a part that worked right out of the box."
3,Misleading title,"I read this book thinking that it would deal with ""The Denial of Aging -- Perpetual Youth, Eternal Life, and Other Dangerous Fantasies"", but the book is definitely not about these things. Perhaps the title of the book could be ""Old Age Sucks, But It Doesn't Have To Be That Way"". The author has written an OK white paper on the state of the world for the frail and demented, and has proposed some changes to the laws, the workplace, and the culture of the US. Interesting stuff, a few disturbing facts (example: ""Among people over 70 who sustain a cardiac arrest outside the hospital, fewer than 1% survive""), but nothing to do with the photograph on the front cover of the geezer on the little kid's bike. Too bad."
3,Works pretty good.,The Y junction air intake works pretty good the only problem I didn't like about is the fact that is just Plastic covered in chrome paint. :(
3,A pain to install,"The color is a match to the original trim in the car, but I am not sure if I would buy this again. It took a lot of working (pressing, bending, cursing) and I had to shave off material in a few spots (none of them visible, mostly the clips). It looks okay once installed, but it still isn't perfect (there is a small gap at the bottom and due to the trouble I had with the clips not fitting it does not follow the curve of the dash evenly). I might buy it again, but I would look at others that are available and see if they had a color that matched my car (at the time this was the best match)."
2,A Disapointment,"Got this to replace my wifes cheap black plastic trim around her stereo. Very disapointed with the fitment. The color is close, but the curvature is COMPLETELY wrong. I ended up attaching it to the upper A/C surround with two very small screws to force the piece to have the correct curve. Before i did that, it would not even snap in place. I thought scosche was a good brand....but not when it comes to aftermarket radio bezels aparently. Only plus side is it does look a *little* more factory than the rough black plastic we did have - thats the only reason i didnt return it."
4,"Realistic, authentic, at first not read voluntarily","We were asked to read this book in our English course. If we had read it out of our own motivation we would have probably all liked it, since it deals with issues that are interesting and important for teenagers. The novel is about a 19 year old girl who emigrates from the Caribbean to New York to work as an au pair. There she is faced with a totally different culture and environment. Her long immigrant journey is presented in a precise, passionate and honest writing style. We think that it is recommendable for schools to give pupils of our age an insight into the thoughts and feelings of a girl who decides to leave her home country to start a new life in a new world."
4,The price of freedom,"Jamaica Kincaid has wonderfully portrayed the life of a young woman from the Caribbean who, in search of freedom, migrates to the U.S. Freedom comes with a price, though, and Lucy is paying it, as she fails to find the peace she hoped she would have gained."
2,"Boring, Lame, Unstimulating","Lucy, by Jamiaca Kincaid, was one of the most boring books that I have ever been subjected to. It made me want to cry, and not from tears. Rather, it was from the boredom and wasting away of life that I experienced while reading. Lucy is a depressed and somber character that fails to find happiness, because she is not searching for it. Depressing. I know."
1,How to marry a millionaire,"Formula for getting a novel published when you have absolutely no ability: marry the son of a famous magazine editor. Write a boring, silly novel, submit it for publication through the literary connections already provided and presto, you're a published wiiter."
4,Opinion,I read a translation and it was so good that I decided that I had to read the novel on it's original language. To me it is a really good book. I totally Recommend it.
2,"Not bad, but not really good eithier...","This was my first reading of Jamaica Kincaid. She has a short, concise style, which made me often feel like I was reading poetry. However, I felt that it also had some downsides, like stifling character growth. In Lucy, the title character comes to America to be an nanny for a rich couple with four young daughters. Lucy watches as their marriage crumbles and tries to avoid turning into her own mother, who for some reason she hates. I wish we knew a bit more about Lucy, like why she hated her homeland so much. It was an alright quick read, but had it been longer, I doubted it would have held my attention."
4,Dried carrots - great for soup.,Decent size for soup. Good flavor.Shipping a bit costly. Good delivery speed.
4,Useful to have on hand,I use this product to add to soups and other prepackaged soups and dishes to add extra flavor and substance to. It's not fresh but easy to have on hand.
1,poor packaging,"Sadly, the package of dried carrots was OPEN at the top, perhaps the sealing machine used to seal the plastic didn't quite catch, but half of the carrots were all over the shipping box, which makes it an expensive product to only get a usable half packet ! The carrots themselves are a fine product, tasty, etc."
3,I Liked It But My Student Didn't,"I've been impressed by the content of the 3 ""History Pockets"" books we've used in our homeschool (Ancient Civilizations, Ancient Egypt, and Ancient Greece). I think they would be really helpful for visual and tactile learners. Unfortunately, my DD hated all the cutting & pasting involved. She found it to be busywork.I would recommend the ""History Pockets"" to students who don't mind all the prep work involved in making the folders/lapbook."
3,"Fun, accessible resource","I refer to this little book again and again. The sections on propagation of herbs are invaluable, well-illustrated and easy to understand. If you love herbs and garden in Texas, you need this book. I would love to see the author's list of herbs expanded in a future edition. The only real down-side to the book is the author's recommendations for watering. I've found that in San Antonio, my herbs take a lot more supplemental watering than he recommends. Remember, Sol Meltzer lives in Houston, an area which gets more rain than the other two-thirds of the state. Also, I'd rather see more information on the plants than have recipes in the back. Still, it's deservedly a classic Texas gardening book."
4,A good reference book,"Great book; one I refer to frequently. It includes an excellent section on propogating herbs.My only complaint is that it does not contain enough (color) photos of the herbs Meltzer refers to. Likewise, in the images section of the book (about 8 pages of snapshots), there are a number of plants shown, but never discussed in the book itself."
1,Poor picture,"In the picture, the item looks like it's nickel plated but the item shipped is brass. I coul;d have bought it at HD and saved money iuf I wanted brass."
3,Changed my mind...,"My first impression of this newest Splash was ""Wow!"" I was impressed by the sheer gamut of paintings from super-realistic to abstract. I found the abstract selections particularly appealing and useful.But at second glance, I was not convinced this would help my painting enough to justify keeping the book. I think I got more out of Jeanne Carbonetti's books (Tao, Zen, Yoga of ...series) and of Watercolor Bold and Free.So, if you want a good selection of examples of art focusing on the use of texture, this is a good selection. If you have a wide library of watercolor books already, this may not be anything really that new."
3,disappointed,"I was very disappointed that this book lacked the in-depth basic technique methods of actually making the marzipan dough, but focused on cake make-up and display of work."
5,All aspects of stock options succinctly explained,"This book is an invaluable reference for any business owner or advisor contemplating the use of stock options to improve a company's performance, motivate employees and create an ownership culture. The National Center for Employee Ownership, the impetus behind this book, is a national treasure, as far as I'm concerned. Their mandate is to democratize the workplace to best reflect the demands and dynamics of the 21st Century Global Economy. This book uniquely addresses everything a company needs to consider regarding stock options: the business, financial, accounting, legal, securities and human resources/organizational development aspects. You cannot find a better resource or more accessible book in the stock options arena."
1,The most degrading display of human being!,"I have never seen people so degrading in my life. I would not go out and do something like that! I wouldn't lower myself to that lenght,it's gross!!!!!!!!!!"
5,THE TAPE WAS FABULAS I REALLY LOVE IT!!!!!,JERRY ALL THE TAPES I RECEIVE FROM U WAS EXCELLENT I HAD NO COMPLAINT'S FROM MY FRIENDS THEY EVEN ENJOYED WATCHING IT SEVERAL TIMES YOU THE BEST.....JERRY JERRY JERRY JERRY JERRY JERRY JERRY JERRY
1,They look good.,"They are nice looking. Not as good as me though. If that's what they like to do, so be it. People may think they're crazy though."
4,Easy to use and helpful for papers,"I had to purchase this book to take a class for composition. My skills are definitely not in the writing side of life, but this book was easy to use. It helped me to put together essays, critiques, and other forms of writing to get me through not only that class, but others that require writing skills. Definitely recommended for those who need some guidance!"
4,Good resource,"This is an assigned text for my English course. The book contains a lot of solid information: relevant chapters addressing various facets of writing; a section on grammar in the back which offers a very informative review, and a wide variety of essays as exhibits of the various styles of writing presented in the book.I wasn't that fond of some of the topics they chose for the essays; some were graphic and somewhat controversial. Some essays were not well written (maybe that was the point), and I prefer to read skilled writing so I can see examples of what the authors are trying to explain.Also not fond of the clay-based paper, which is not forgiving when exposed to moisture."
3,Step by step,"This book was surprisingly helpful and easy to follow. Step by step instructions, paragraphs, and plenty of examples. A short paragraph is written about each featured writer to help the reader better understand the stories. Makes English class a breeze!"
2,This Is a SAD a** movie,UGH! this movie is sooooo low budgetd til it makes me cry such a screwed movie the cover is and back cover is soo not true you dont even see those scences in the movie if u r just bored and want something to watch to make your life seem a little brighter watch it nothing is more depressing I promisexoxox Happy Friday!
3,"Should be entitled ""History of the Wisteria""","The author is clearly an authority on the vine (or tree or shrub...), but I found the book overflowing with the history of each variety with little information or advice on how to grow. I reviewed the book again today as I went out to prune my wisteria and couldn't even find the work ""prune"" or ""pruning"" in the index! It's a beautiful history book with lovely pictures but far from a ""how-to"" guide, if that's what you're looking for. Perhaps I didn't look closely enough at the book's description before purchasing!"
4,Excellent information on specific varieties/cultivars,"As a lay home gardener I found this book to be a bit on the academic side. It seems to be written with Wisteria connoisseurs in mind. However, I did find the Wisteria history to be interesting. And, the pictures are definitely worth taking a look at. The photos showing Wisterias being used in different growing situations was very helpful.The list of individual Wisterias was helpful to me in selecting a good cultivar for my particular site. After reading the section on care and training, though, I would have to disagree with the author that Wisteria's aren't that much work. To me they appear to be quite a gardening commitment."
5,"Valder's ""Wisterias""",I know of no other book vailable that is as comprehensive a treatment of wisterias. It is a must for any wisteria lover.
1,"Looks Good, Ergonomically Horrrible","Can hardly cut chicken, much less bone. Weak shears and I would not recommend. I cannot trult describe just how bad these shears are. Suffice to say they are not worth the price at any price."
5,Awesome,"I bought these from another site on sale & my mother in law came over and was so impresses that she want some for Christmas. These were identical from the ones I purchased, she was so excited!"
1,Faith as mesure of truth ?,"The Fatima witnesses does not to have to be credited more than our modern ""contactees"" and extraterrestrial mythlogy: they have also a message and a transformative process. Why must we believe in the Fatima witnesses and reject the present ""experiences"" of close encounters? Are the religious criteria better than the our modern ""alien experiences"" witnesses? Of course not. Fatima phenomena show all the physical and psychological parameters and the same process of the present. Any believer must compare and study the real orginal Fatima reports reserached by Portuguese historians Dr. Joaquim Fernandes and Fina d'Armada in their Fatima books: ""Celestial Secrets"" and ""Heavenly Lights"" ( Anomalist Books, 2007 )"
3,"It's no ""Moon Dance"", but still an admirable effort.","Gary Brandner attempts to do for werewolves what Stephen King did for vampires in ""Salem's Lot"", as things get hairy in the California town of Drago. He only partially suceeds in this novel that inspired a passable movie adaptation. Nothing remarkable, but there are a few good scenes and the werewolves themselves are delightlfully wicked. Also, this novel paved the way for a lot of much better werewolf novels which followed."
3,The Howling,"Rent the movie. It's far more interesting. While reading this book I got the feeling that the author was relying a bit too much on shock value and sacrificing plot. Having seen the movie in the past, I was disappointed with the novel."
4,One of the great werewolf novels,Classic old school werewolf story. I have to say it is MUCH easier for the baddies to get to you when live in the mountains and your only means of communication is a phone at the local mom and pop grocery store in town and you don't even know how to drive. What young adult person didn't know how to drive in the 70's? Lots of stereotypes from the time period. The hero even drives a suped up Camero. They don't mention the gold chains and the half open silk shirt but if you grew up in the 70's you know that they are there.Consider it a time capsule. And a fun one at that. Crisp writing. Action that proceeds at a perfect pace. Nasty werewolves from the old country transplanted into the mountains in America. A sexy gypsy woman for a villain. What is not to like?
4,Buy this book!!,"The Howling was a very entertaining read. This book was a great introduction to the series and the end of the book leaves you wanting more. There are yet so many questions to be answered, and I will be turning to the second book in the series soon.The Howling was turned into a movie in the early 80's. I remember watching the movie when I was a kid and it scared the crap out of me. For some reason, werewolves freak me out. While browsing on a used online bookstore, I came across this book and had to buy it. The first thing that struck me right off was how different the book and movie are. This is NOT a bad thing. Because of this, reading the book was like a new experience.This classic werewolf story is a must read for any horror genre fan. If you don't have it on your shelf then you must go buy it now...really, go buy it now!"
3,better than the movie,I don't understand why they changed the movie so much the book is ten times better. I hope you have as much fun reading it as I did
5,"Tremendous! Horror and Werewolf enthusiasts, don't loose it","This book has a lot of suspense and mystery. The way the secrets are managed is incredible, a crescent doubt until finally things already suspected are getting more and more clear, but then, the tension is already unbearable and the extreme danger already dominating: just too late. This is one rare opportunity to get into a entirely different approach to the werewolf myth, not a cursed nature but a wild and extremely unpredictable one. Also, there is place for sensuality around the sexy sinister Marcia: fear and attraction at the same time. Joe Dante's movie ""The Howling"" from 1980 is based in this novel, with some considerable differences that make both of them going to other directions but still related, and both of them very interesting. The book is just perfect for horror readers."
4,Allright....,"This book was good but wasn't great. There weren't too many frightening scenes, really. When you get down to it, the beginning rape scene is more shocking than anything else. This book also has a few explicit depictions of sex whichh makes the reader wonder whether or not this is a porno that claims to be horror. If you like this type of stuff, than make a decision. If you're looking for horror prepared to be disappointed. The funny thing is that you want to read it all the way through no matter what. Not bad."
5,One of the best Modern Horror stories to date!,"One of the best werewolf tales ever told, read this as a kid and have read at least 5 times since! Better than the film series of the same name. Actually boxed up this purchase and sent it to the Author to have it signed, he's a very nice man!"
4,"Cheap, reliable, color a bit off","I've always used C9 bulbs on my outdoor strings. This year (Christmas 2010) for the first time I have been unable to find replacement bulbs locally. Apparently the usual supplier (Sylvania?) stopped making them now that everyone is going LED. So I was happy to find these. They cost about half what C9s used to cost at the local hardware store.I bought 50 of them, red, orange, green, blue. I had one DOA and no burnouts in the first couple of weeks, which is better than the old hardware store bulbs. My only complaint is that the red bulbs are not a nice deep red like the Sylvanias, they are more like a red-orange. The other colors are fine, brightness is fine. No off-center or loose bases. A good substitute. I think they're made in Thailand."
5,thankyou!,looked for these everywhere you were the only ones that had them thanyou so much ! my dad is a very happy man now !
5,Red Replacement Bulbs Part Of Wedding Gift.,"My sister recently gave me a broken red mini type bulb that was to be anessential element of a monstrous statue, to be part of a gag wedding giftfor my niece getting married in a couple of months. I walked around theMall in a couple of outlet stores with no luck finding what I needed. Idecided to give the Net a try, so I went to Amazon.com I found a site witha billion bulbs. I bought two handfuls, dirt cheap. Shipping cost 10x whatthe bulbs cost. They got to me super fast. It all would have been worth it ifI had kept a closer look on the broken bulb and actually bought the rightsize bulb...dummy! Some lessons are a hassle to learn."
3,A fuzzy review...,"Fuzzy Set Theory: Applications in the Social Sciences is a good detailed penetration of fuzzy set theory for social scientists who want to gain a greater understanding of the range of fuzzy set theory applications. If you don't have a good understanding of set theory notation and set operations you will not appreciate a good majority of the book. The book could have been improved by addressing the use of fuzzy set theory to illustrate graded levels of fit to personality prototypes, and offered a few more examples of how to display fuzzy sets."
1,System crashes are worse than Windows 95,"Do not buy this unit. Somewhere between 70-90% of the DVDs that I have attempted to burn have turned into coasters. The worst is when you spend 3 hours filling a disc with stuff only for the unit to freeze up. At this point, the only way to get the AD-8091 to respond is to unplug the unit. After plugging it back in, the DVD+R disk is fried and not recognized by the unit, so the unit locks up again. Then you have to use another DVD+R disk. Then you may have a 50/50 chance of recording and burning a full disk without the system crashing on you. Don't touch this thing with a ten foot pole!!!"
1,Tried to make lemonade with this lemon,"I wasted at least 12 hours trying to get this thing working! I read the owners manual, bought the recomended brand and type of media discs, and now I have a small pile of trashed discs. This thing freezes up and I had to keep unplugging it from the wall. Maybe it should come with a ""clapper"" switch. It looks like others have had good results, so maybe I'll ask for a replacement unit. I wanted entertainment, but got aggravation. It would stop during the recording process, and another time it actually completed, but then it couldn't play what it had just recorded! I tried to ""finalize"" the disk etc.. no good. I even visited the Aspire web site for help. They should rename it ""Expire""!"
2,Not worth the hassles....,This unit is riddled with bugs. [...].htmbut it does very little to fix the problems of this model. It is EXTREMELY difficult to get it to finalize dvds. The quality with the rf connection is horrible. It's a nightmare to get around on some of the menus. I would save my money and try a different manufacturer.
5,excellent for anyone,i just bought one a month ago and have had no trouble what so ever. I have been recording some old tapes from my vcr and they have come out perfect. Also watched all 3 Lord of the Rings and enjoyed everyone of them. I would recommend the Aspire to anyone. I would also like to say that Amazon was great also with their delivery. Thanks so much. A HAPPY CUSTOMER
1,Not Recommended,"This items has plenty of features for the price but this is of little value if you can't record DVDs. When attempting to record TV broadcasts to DVD+RW, the unit would freeze between 30 to 60 minutes into the recording and not respond to commands from either the remote or front panel controls. The only option was to unplug the unit then plug it back in. Changing to a different brand of DVD+RW disc did not resolve the problem.The manufacturer acknowledged this problem and posted a ROM update on it's website. After installing the update, nothing changed. I will return this item to the retailer tomorrow after owning it for seven days."
2,timer repeat recording doesn't work,"The unit works ok, if your watching a show and hit record. If you try to do a Repeat timer recording, the unit turns itself on everyday. example: I want to record a show EVERY friday from 10 to 11. If you set it up as a repeat recording, it will turn on the unit every DAY at 10:00 and never turn it off. so every morning I find the unit on.I have been able to record shows I am watching with little trouble. I downloaded the firmware update too."
1,Extremely Unreliable until it Died,"This started out being a great, inexpensive dvd recorder that worked well...at first. It would freeze up a lot requiring me to unplug it often. After a couple of months I was unplugging it several times an hour. It can't even perform the basics right anymore and won't read/play the very dvd's I recorded on it. And there is no company support!"
5,Very interesting,"I recommend this as a must-read book to just about everyone. Not because I agree with everything Ross says (because I don't) but because it opens up a completely new and refreshing perspective on the whole cosmology, religion, and the meaning of the universe topic. I especially liked the part describing just what conditions must be met for human life to develop in the universe.His arguments are quite reaching in many places, but that does not disqualify his valid points, of which there are many, and it is worth it to the reader to hear them in a society increasingly being indoctrinated by a secular, politically correct elite.Very interesting book."
1,"Genesis tells us Who, Why, What , When& How, not Sciencism","Genesis of the Word claims to tell us these things about Creation: Who, Why, What, How, When.Sciencism of the world claims to tell us these things about Creation: What, How, When.Genesis tells us what Sciencism doesn't. Genesis also tells us what Sciencism tries to tell us.The Creator Himself as Author of Genesis asks us: which version of What, How, When will you wilfully choose to believe or reject?Dear reader of Genesis, the decision is yours. Please choose wisely. Did Genesis get the What, How, When wrong? Say it isn't so!"
1,Science and the Bible agree?,"If, as Dr. Ross contends, that the Bible and science agree, why does Leviticus 11 say that the bat is a bird and that fowl have four legs?"
2,Motor Max 1950 Chevy Bel Air 1:18 diecast,"Motor Max almost knocked the ball out of the park with this model. It should have had a $60 price point. It's a compelling auto story and a great interpretation. So why $25? One error: the box isn't tall enough to keep the packaging from scratching on the roof of the car. For that matter, discriminating collectors will be disappointed that the plastic see-through portion of the package seems unusually scratch-prone.At this price, I still call it a buy, but it takes a while to get over the scratches (or repair them) if you wind up with them."
2,This Book Prepares Mothers for the Worst,"Each chapter in this book begins with an ""Ideal"" and a corresponding ""Fact."" They then go on to shed stark reality on the Ideal, dealing with issues like colick, marital problems, the contridictory social messages about career vs family, the threat of poor daycare, etc. They have worst-case scenario stories from women who have experienced the ""fact"" part of the equation. The result is a very negative portrail of pregnancy and parenting. I bought this at a used bookstore for a shower. After reading it, I didn't want to give it to a first-time mother. Possibly good for discouraging young girls from pregnancy, though."
3,Year of Our Lord,it is not the best album in the world but if you are a fan of metal of the swedish melodic death persuasion then it wouldnt hurt to give it a trybest track: the gones of astria
2,Neat Little Toy,"I bought this guitar for my kid who thinks he wants to be a rock star. It's a great looking little guitar, and the little amp (which I first laughed at) takes a 9V battery or a DC adapter which is not supplied. The amp has a belt clip so you can play and walk around and play at the same time. The reason I rated this so low is because it stopped working after the first 20 minutes. I replaced the battery and even bought another lager amp, so I have narrowed it down to the actual guitar or cord. I will re-evaluate my rating once I seek Customer Assisance and get a response...... Check back."
2,Love the guitar. Will never use Amazon again!,"I couldn't be happier with the guitar itself! It is perfect and my son LOVES it. The service through amazon itself....NEVER again! I will go straight to the seller and purchase the item. Amazon stated it was one price. I agreed to that price and bought it, then got a bill from them stating the selling price was the 97.14 I agreed to and then when I scrolled down further I noticed they changed the price on the bill and selected 2 day shipping. When we called them, they met us half way on the price, which was $40 more than I originally agreed to. I am so disappointed in their lack of customer service and a little uneasy about their bait and switch."
1,Not worthy of its subject,"After reading the book, I felt very sorry for Pam. Not because of anything that did or did not happen in her life, but rather because she's the victim of a poorly written bio. There's very little personal revelation, particularly with regard to her adult life. There's just a lot of repetitive stuff about her professional work and the struggle getting to the top - ""Oh woe is me, no one in country wants to accept me as a rocker. Why can't Reba paint the way for me"" Whatever. The author really does an injustice to Pam making her sound like a whiny little follower.Pam is a great talent. I don't believe the book is an accurate record of her life."
2,Nothing new here........ uninspired,"Most of his material on this show seems to be a quagmire of plagiarized stuff ""borrowed"" from acts like Robin Williams (Middle east/ Iraq War etc.., Cedric the entertainer, (Black people ruuun/ orginal kings of comedy), Steve Harvey (original kings of comedy, Elian joke) and ironically.. from his OWN stuff!There is nothing new or fresh that this show offers, albeit more of 'Whitey' bashing, some 7-eleven habib jokes, indo-pak nuke , DC sniper was black etc etc...DL - you were the 'ORIGINAL' king of comedy, man. underline original."
1,He's Losing it!,I keep thinking that D.L. would get funnier but he never does. I regret buying this album because he is not as funny as he was in Kings of Comedy. I suggest you buy this only if you don't have a sense of humor.
1,plastic cards?,not as advertised and should not have been in same search results as real plastic cards waste of money
3,Death Row's Back? We'll sort of.....,"The first album of new material from Tha Row in some time is average at best. ""I'm Back"" is the worst Kurupt track I've heard in a long time. His lyrics are tired and the beat is dismal. The remix of ""Still Tha Row"" featuring Crooked I is pretty weak compared to the original version.The best track is the title theme which features Danny Boy on the hook and some inspired lyrics from Crook. Jay-Z's ""Hovi Baby"" remix is real good if you're a fan of Jigga.Most of the album is uninspired party tracks that pretty much sound like everything else on the radio. The diss track, ""Tha Row (Y'all Hoes)"" is not one of the best I've heard but at least, it adds something different to a mediocre release.TRACKS TO CHECK FORDysfunktional FamilyHovi Baby (remix)1 CallTha Row (Y'all Hoes)Too Street 4 TVWe Ballin'The rest of the tracks are all just pretty much on the party tip."
3,Creepin on a come up?,"Aightz....Got this cd and had some words bout it....Definitely a good soundtrack worth bumpin to....We Ballin' and Get Off Tha Block are 2 tracks that are definite bumpers and worthy to break ya necks to....Dys-Funk-Tional is a slick, flowin beat and Tha Row (Ya'll Hoes) is just a damn good song....Callin this a soundtrack though? Not sure bout that. The tie in with the movie is minimal at best....This soundtrack is more ""claiming we deathrow fo' life"" and dissin former deathrow inmates than anything else. Anywho, Tha Row appears to be on the mends now that they are concentrating on their own artists.....Listen to this one before you buy it....."
1,Weak,This album was a huge disappointment. I was a Crooked I fan but after hearing this album Im not waitin for his album anymore. Weak effort and major disappointment.
1,Um..THIS is Death Row?,"I thought Death Row/Tha Row was supposed to be back? Guess I was wrong..dead wrong. The Jay-Z song is nice, but previously released. Avoid this one."
4,Great!,"This album is great and shows that Death Row will make a great come back to the rap industry. However, some of the songs on the album were not quite up to par with the others and were more like filler tracks rather then then irresistable, hard core, ""Still Tha Row."" The Dysfunktional Family soundtrack shows Suge Knights new talent including Crooked I, Gail Gotti, and N.I.N.A.(N.I.N.A. is actually Lisa ""Left Eye"" Lopes under the name New Identity Non Aplicable.) Crooked I is definitely a great rapper and needs to be more on the radio and his album, ""Say Hi to the Bad Guy"" needs to be released. To wrap up, The Dysfunktional Family soundtrack may not be perfect but it is definitely worth buying."
4,"From a reader in Atlanta, Georgia April 12, 2000",This compact book provides practical phrases. I find it handy to stick in my bag to review before Spanish class or while waiting in line. Good phonetic pronunciation guides.Overall very helpful.
4,"so far, so good","At first appears to be a stick in a pot, but leaves started growing within the first two days. The stems have grown a lot by now (its been over a month). I haven't planted it yet. I guess only time will tell about the quality (or presence) of the actual berries. The only reason I've given it 4 stars is because I'm not able to judge the berries yet."
2,bad shape,got plant in bad condition okay size hopefully will make come back no instructions on how to grow no fruit when arrived average size fro 3 in sq pot
2,Awfully slow plot,The book's plot goes out of the main story so many times that you'll forget what were you reading. You'll know how the book'll end in the sixth chapter and that's a book's turn down. There are much better books written by JD than this one. So pick another book instead of this one.
1,Jungsoft HDD Sheriff - LAN version,"The concept of this product is so good for multiuser computer labs -- the system files are all restored by rebooting so nobody can seriously crash the system or infect it with viruses. BUT...the reality has been a serious pain. I run computers that have ASUS brand motherboards, and there is a recognized (although not highly publicized) incompatability with the hdd sheriff. There is a patch (flashing the bios of the card while it's installed on an intel motherboard, for pete's sake) for the PCI version of sheriff, but there is no patch for the lan version, and JUNGSOFT hasn't answered any emails to offer an alternate solution. Very disappointing."
3,Granddaddy of most of japan's soundtracks,"The Armitage:Poly Matrix album has many of the genres and sounds that would influence future music. The poly matrix disc is a great album on its own. A range of eletronic, rock, acid jazz, and the various mixes makes the album seem like a mix tape. The only let down is the album is getting dated.The Dual matrix disc tries really hard to reach the same standard. But, its a sequel.The buy is worth it just for the poly matrix disc, especially for fans of anime music."
3,Pumpkin Powder,"The powder is ok, it really did not add much flavor to the products I was making. Maybe I recieved a stale batch. Will try again."
2,Subpar material from both artist and label.,"Lionel Marchetti, Portrait d'un Glacier (Alpes 2173m) (Ground Fault, 2001)Another series I release from Ground Fault, this one a musique concrete-y/field recording type of release. Unfortunately, it's not as easy to recommend as much of the other stuff Ground Fault has released in this vein.Clocking in at only twenty-eight minutes and change, Portrait d'un Glacier is exceptionally minimal, even for a Ground Fault Series I release; every once in a while, something audible pops up, but for the most part you have to have your system all the way cranked. (So when something loud DOES pop up you're scared out of your seat). And what's here isn't terribly interesting; there is very little in the way of sonic drift. Quite different from the other stuff of Marchetti's I've heard, and not nearly as interesting.It pains me to say I can't recommend something from the usually excellent Ground Fault label, but this one felt like Marchetti wasn't trying all that hard. **"
3,Unusable,"I recieved this product with a chip on one of the frames which made all of them un-usable. After I spent a lot of money on these frames, I still had to go to an local store and purchase three more frames. I will say that the items were packed with a lot of care."
5,Best CD EVER!,"I agree with the last person that this album is huge change in style of music from her previous album ""Golpeando Fuerte."" However, she still has the greatest voice ever, and these songs are better written and better sung than any of her previous albums. She has really grown as an artist, and I don't think it can get any better than this, but we'll see, when we listen to her next album."
5,It fits perfectly,"It fits perfectlyIt arrives on time, works without any problem. I am very pleased with the service and with the cost. Thanks amazon."
4,"Powerful, beautiful and thought provoking album","After buying a copy of ""Songs of Simple Dreams"", I was impressed enough to try an other album by this band. I trusted the the other reviews and purchased a copy of Sins of Commission. I am glad I did, what a great album. I like intelligent music so it is no surprise that I really like this CD. My favorite song is Frontline, every time I play it I think of my cousin fighting in Iraq. A second excellent song is Head in the Sand. All in all this is a powerful, beautiful and thought provoking album, with great song writing along the lines of Bruce Cockburn and Chrissy Hynde, A valuable addition to any serious music fans collection."
3,Pretty Good,"3.5 STARSPretty good album, a bit of a mix of styles but it works. I like the raw charm of this CD. A lot of albums for my taste are either to poppy or too noisy, this one meets in the middle pretty well. I like almost all the songs especially ""Frontline"" with it's dramatic intro and 60's protest attitude. ""Bed of nails"" is great catchy rock song, that I put on my ""best of"" Ipod playlist. I think this is a good album that does not sound like the rest of the horde out there and is worth getting if you like good but rough songs with some searing vocals and guitar work."
4,All the songs are so good,"This album is so great that I don't know what to say! Few of these songs were hits and they ALL should have been. Smoke Ring Days never recorded anything like it again. It has a great atmosphere and they flow into each other very well. It's really hard to explain why these songs are so great. There are some nice guitar solos on them. I guess it's just that all the songs are so well written. And they play them with so much passion.This album I think was voted as the best indie album of 2001 in a magazine put out by a record chain, who's name I can't remember. Check out Frontline and Head in the Sand which are fantastic jam songs along the lines of The Doors and The Grateful Dead. Super cool cover art as well!"
4,Trippy Album,"Sins of Commission is the most jammed-out album from the Smoke Ring Days and is their most trippiest. This is very real (not some lame marketing attempt by some record company to try and sell you something from an era that everyone is trying to exploit these days). This is not some fake kiddy pop ""psychadelia."" The music here sends shivers up my spine with its surreal beauty. There are few albums which do that. This seems to be an attempt to change the Smoke Ring Days style after their earlier albums, still trying to find the right avenue to go down. The heavy psychadelic influence wouldn't really last too long, but it gives us a unique perspective at Smoke Ring Days at a particular point in time. Head in the Sand and Frontline are the heart of this album, each one over 10 minutes long with some great free form moments much like the Dead, Doors and old Airplane. A bit of a departure from Songs of Songs of Simple Dreams, but a very good album."
3,Handle,"I over looked the handle part on other reviews but they were right it gets lose after it gets wet from wash, seems that the wood shrinks which makes it lose."
2,Not bad but....,metal flexes a lot...wood on handle is loose and wiggles when used.Size is just right to flip burgers and food in my tepanyaki griddle. Will keep on using and see how it will last.
2,rusty and flimsy,I was so excited to have found this for my hubbys birthday. He was so happy to open this gift!WELL he used them and our exciting fun new spatula idea went down the drain!!The solid face spatula is not connected to the wood that well and it feels like it is super loose! The metal on the handle already had rust on it!! after one use. So we had rust spots on our hands which lead to the rust spots on my kahki pants.. NO BUENO!!I wouldnt waste your time to buy this product. You pay more in cleaning cost for your rust spots.
1,be warned,"They began to rust before I used them once. The sticky labels on the metal were difficult to remove so I soaked them in soapy water. The next day rust everywhere, and it is even harder to remove than the labels."
4,Commerical quality at a good price,I was very pleased with my purchase. The quality was evident and at a good price. My primary use is on BBQ and flat top for outside entertaining. I would recommend this product to someone looking for this type of product.
4,The Inheritance,"Enjoyable!Despite the Editorial review, I enjoyed this book; it's not your average everyday love story!Be sure to read The Maverick. It's a continuation of some of the characters introduced in The Inheritance."
3,Gotta Have One...(or a few),"I have needed to use these a couple of times with mixed results. Sometimes, the tubes were just frustrating and I gave up to buy a new tube. I wish there were more glue in these packs though - I can almost guarantee you will never run out of patches before tape."
4,great tool to have,i gave this as a gift to a biking enthusiast. they had cheaper patch kits and were excited to see this better quality product in their gift bag.
5,Works well,Patched 2 tubes and they've been holding air for quite sometime now. Very easy to use once you find the puncture on the tube.
1,Worthless!!!,I was on a ride and found when I put my spare tube in that I had created a hole while putting it in. No big deal since I had a patch kit with me. Well guess what this patch kit did not patch the tiny hole that was there. It looked patched but as soon as I put air in the tube you could hear the air coming out.So I tried it again at home just to make sure it wasn't something I was doing wrong. Went through a whole kit trying and never got a good patch to stick. I've done lots of patches in my time and I've never had such a hard time applying a patch in my life! Will never use this product again especially if I'm going to be stranded 10 miles from home or more.
5,Perect patch for the job,So these came very handy. THe patches and glue are all new and in great condition.I will order 2 more sets for back ups on all our bikes and road crews..
4,Works in emergencies,"I have used the patchs in the past and I have had mixed results. In the large tubes of my hybrid they have worked well and sealed the wholes properly, in my roadie with its tiny a thin tube it let some air scape. Some of the patches actually are unusable in the small tubes and if the hole is close to a seem it is very likely it will not seal completelly. When you are on the road you probably want something 100% guaranted but that may not be possible. I now carry a brand new spare tube in my roadie at all times instead of the patch kit"
4,Applying Patch,"I have seen two different ways in these comments on how to apply these patches to a tube. I contacted Park Tools to see which method was correct. This was their response:Thank you for your question on correctly using our...VP-1 patch Kit. The side that has the foil backing is the side that sticks to the tube.Peel the foil backing from the patch, and press the patch onto the tube...see belowClick here: http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/inner-tube-repairI hope this helps."
3,"good patches, but more or less a one-shot deal","Just like all patch kits this one comes with a number of patches and a small tube of vulcanizing fluid. Thanks to decent tires and additional tire armor I don't get punctures very often, maybe once or twice a year. That means that I have plenty of patches but the little tube of fluid is either new or dried out, and then I end up buying a new kit.It's the cheapest kit I've found and works fine, but it still annoys me to throw out most of it just to buy a new tube of vulcanizing fluid. You can buy the fluid separately (different brand) but that little tube costs more than this entire kit."
5,Excellent product! Works great,Just what I needed to patch a car inner tube I was using for the pool.Was ready to throw away and thought I would give this a try.You put on the glue and let it dry and then put on the patch.Thats it!I think the patch actually melts into the tube and becomes part of the rubber tube itself.At least thats what it looks like to me.Bottom line is it did the job.
2,Lasts for a few Minutes,"I used this once I received this, when I tried to apply glue it POPPED and it came from the other side and just wasted everything!! I was dissapointed! The tube Deinflates however even when the patch is on wtf?"
4,Worked Great,The repair kit did a great job at fixing the flat tire on my bike. It was easy to use and came with enough pieces to fix many more flats.
2,glue,"patches are fine but the glue that comes with it does not seem to hold well compared to what I had before. It takes really really long time for it to dry and you cant pump air before it dries. One of the patches came loose about 10 minutes back on the road. If you have the time to wait couple hours It seems safe to pump air and get back on the road otherwise you have to risk stopping again, taking all apart, patching again (gotto use a new patch) and then try to get back on the road all over again and pray that it does not have come loose again."
4,Good patch kit,"This is your standard tire patch kit. It comes with everything you need. unfortunately, I probably paid more for shiipping than I did the patch kit."
4,Great patch kit if you take time to patch it right.,I'm replacing my old Park Tool patch kit. I've had these patches last for years on mountain bike tubes. Never any problems. The tubes wore out before the patches did in many cases.My advice is to use only a pea size amount of the glue after scuffing the tube then spread it around to the size of the patch (it will dry better this way) and let it dry to a very tacky feel. Place the patch over the glue and stand on the patched portion of the tube for a couple minutes if you can. Insert tube into tire making sure not to pinch the tube under the bead of the tire. Voila! Great patch kit. Thanks.SPO
4,About as good as they get.,"A lot of people when they flat just throw the tube away never trusting to patches. I have done the same but I still carry a patch kit because if a my spare fails, I've can either repair the patch or walk. Besides the patch kit is relatively small and weighs almost nothing. I have experimented with the patches and they are about as good as you'll find. They are relatively large and the the glue works pretty well. I also carry a very small squeeze vial of 91% rubbing alcohol to clean the are of tire talc to improve the changes for a quality seal.I would have given this kit 5 stars but as with most patch kit, the tube of glue is too small. I'd pay slightly more if they provided two tubes."
5,Helpful little box,"Nice little box with six patches. The patch is holding up well when applied to a leak in my bike tube. The shipping is fast and on time. Would recommend to bring one along with your biking trips.A word of caution, if you are not sure how big the patch will be, try to cut a piece of paper based on the product description and get a sense of it. It may save you some trouble later."
3,Fast Shipping,"I bought this from Discount Bike Supply If I remember the shipping was fast, but still did Not fix My leak so now I looking for hot patches or new Inner tubes Bartlesville Oklahoma No more has any Bicycle shops I need 700C X 23 I could Not find at local stores."
2,Doesnt help recover a puncture tube,Park Tool VP-1 Vulcanizing Patch Kit DID NOT help recover the punctured tube of my bicycle. Even after following the direction with greatest care the patch did not help...whenever I pump the air in the tube it use to get loosen and air blow out of my tube...I would suggest getting a new tube instead of getting the vulcanizing patches.
3,Park vulcanizin patches VP-1,I did want the type of vulanizing patches that you light the back of the patch on fire and it melts the patch so the patch becomes a part of the tube and yes these are good but I could have purchased these under aanother brand name for $2.99 a kit.Here you are paying for the name.
3,Repair kit,"Bought for my wife. Hasn't needed it yet though how can you screw this one up? Weirdly, no french chalk, maybe that's just a me thing."
3,"good sound, but hurts my bigger ears.","I got a pair of these headphones with my RCA MP3 player, and they work ok. My biggest thing is that after about 30 minutes on, the way they clip to the ear, the edge of my ear feels sore, but also they irrirate just behind my ears where they rest, so they get uncomfortable. So, they are ok, but they do have other models available of hear bud size headphones that clip into the ear that are more comfortable on my ears. you just have to try them if you can before you buy them. around 5-10 depending on where you look online or at stores."
4,Greek Sweet,First had these candies at a Greek restaurant. Excited to find them on Amazon. They arrived in great shape and taste just like the ones I had at the restaurant. They're especially nice since they are small; you can carry a few easily in your pocket.
4,Very interesting,"I'm not sure why this is ranked 169,xxx, it should be up in the 167's or 166's. The Richard Young do a very good job of what they do, which is kind of a mystery, but if you like bands on the Jagjaguwar label, you will like this. I play this CD a lot, and I can't really sing along, but it keeps me good company."
4,@MakellBird on twitter says...,"This is a great book for anyone looking to collect Marc Silvestri's art. It is more a less just that unfortunately, an art book. If you're looking to buy something for READING purposes, look for the Wolverine Classic TPBs because they are in order. Marvel obviously sees the VALUE (to themselves) in producing a ton of TPBs but it just makes things confusing."
2,Bad enough to make Dali's Mustache curl!,"This has to be the worst artist DVD/VHS I've ever seen, whereas the Franz Kline vhs was choppy,short and lacking in detail this one is nothing more than grainy pictures of Dali's work shown against a plain background while a dull voice over tells you about each piece and it goes on like this through the WHOLE DVD! It almost looks like an high school video project for a final exam. There is no footage of the artist at work or his hometown or any other pictures or information just the repitition of each painting being shown and talked about briefly. SAVE YOUR MONEY even die hard Dali fans will be disapointed, this could be used as a teaching tool to novice painters and that is its only redeeming feature!"
3,I Can Write!,"""I can write! I can talk! I can go to meetings and drop names! And what names they are! Nixon, Haldeman, Eisenhower - met them, knew them, worked for them. Am I great, or what?""Okay, I admit it. I'm a democrat and the author is a republican. That being said, I bought this book seeking to learn more and gain some insight about past leaders and senior government officials. In that sense, the book was somewhat successful - hence the three stars. Unfortunately, the author's never ending patting himself on his back interfered with his stories and reminisces, some being quite interesting. Had he shown more self restraint, this book would have been a much better read."
1,...AAH!!! LET THE BOOK END!!!,"I can describe this book in one word&#65533; BORING! I didn&#65533;t like many things about the book. One would be that it was describing the &#65533;journey&#65533; too much. The book described the journey, like when you tell your friends about your &#65533;vacation route&#65533; this summer. Another thing I loathed was the history lessons popping up in the book. Normally I like history, but this seemed more like reading the fancy language in old documents.The plot of the book didn&#65533;t appeal to me like some other books I have read did. The idea of someone suddenly going on a quest for gold seems pretty dull and unoriginal to me.Some other books I&#65533;d recommend would be the Harry Potter series if you haven&#65533;t read it. &#65533;The Fellowship of the Ring&#65533; is a pretty good book also, despite the fact that it is the same author as &#65533;The Hobbit.&#65533;"
2,I actually didn't like this book,"Okey, I'm almost at the end of reading this book. Still I find no interesting plots except an on-going storyline. When I first bought it, I had high expectations on it as I adored the movie ""The fellowship of the ring."" The storyline is not as intriguing as the Lord of the ring. It goes on and on and on and on...till it stops, and hurray the story is over!!! I kind of like the goblin and the riddle part, but rest it's like a long going nile."
3,The Hobbit,"I think that this book is kind of confusing because they were talking in some sort of an ancient language. ""The Hobbit"" is about a little hobbit who has big adventures after being dragged along with some dwarves. I'm not going to tell you any more information about this book. So if you liked the books and the movie of ""The Lord of the Rings,"" you should read this book since it's the prelude of The Lord of the Rings triolgy. You should read this also if like action and adventure. I recommend that you read this before you read the trilogy or see the movie."
1,The Hobbit,"The Hobbit is so boring I would not recomend reading it. It has no action that actually lights up your mind and makes you want to continue and finish the book. The story is about a pleasent, independent, little hobbit, Bilbo, that has been chosen to be a burgler without further notice to go on a quest with 13 dwarves into exhausting danger that may just be the end for dear old Mr. Bilbo. If you'd like to discover what will happen to Bilbo and his faithful leaders then feel free to pick this book up, but i wouldn't recomend it."
5,The Hobbit,"This book is about a Hobbit named Bilbo Baggings who is a gental ceature. Gandalf, a wizard, meets him one day to send him on a adventure with 13 dwarves. Bilbo is 14th to be lucky. Togather the 14 of them go through many adventures togather; to find the treasure of Thrain. This is one of my favorite books that I have ever read, It is packed full with adventure and fantisy which makes it interesting to read when you combine these togather. I hope you can find the time to read The Hobbit and find out what happens to Bilbo next."
2,Note,"This product is not the original book, The Hobbit, by J. R. R. Tolkein, it is a dramatization of the book written by Patricia Gray."
3,Dramatized version... look out!,"This is Patricia Gray's dramatization of The Hobbit, authorized by Tolkien. It is NOT his book. As such, it would make a decent elementary or junior high level play, for which it is clearly intended. Unfortunately, I bought this version thinking it was the actual book, perhaps illustrated by Ms. Gray.Enjoyable for the low-tech costume and scenic suggestions (Gollum in a wetsuit with swimming goggles for eyes)."
1,Way off base with ending of book!,"When I first began to read this play, I loved it. Lots of action and great characters. However, the ending of the script is WAY off base and NOTHING like the end of The Hobbit book by J.R.R. Tolkien.In Tolkien's book:1. Bard kills Smaug.2. Thorin dies.3. Kili and Fili die.4. There is a huge battle for the rights to the treasure.In the script:1. Thorin kills Smaug.2. Thorin lives happily ever after.3. Everyone lives.4. There is no battle over the treasure. Everyone just nicely divides the treasures without any problems.5. There is no mention of the wolves, the eagles, Beorn or the spiders. I know that everything can't be included, but she should have at least mentioned them.Too bad that the ending is so wrong. I would have loved to produce this play, but it is too far removed from the book."
1,Description unclear,This is NOT the novel; it is a dramatization based on it. This is not made clear in the description of the item
5,Great book,one day when Bilbo the hobbit sitts outside his hous and smokes a strange old man comes by and Bilbo invites him for te the next day and the next dy when the man omes he has 13dwarfs whit him and they take poor Bilbo on an adventure to reclaim a tresure that was stolen from the dvarfs by a dragon: Smoug the horrible
2,confussing but good,"You need need to have a great imagition to read the hobbit. Most of this book is all fantasy about dragons, dwarves, hobbits, elves, and all that other fantasy stuff. Also the names of the people and places are so long, thy'er hard to pronounce. You can't remember the names of some of the charactors because some of them are so similar. Another reason why i gave this book two stars is because it has a very slow start. there is no adventure or excitement at the begining of the book."
1,The Hobbit,"The Hobbit is the most boring book I have ever read. It does not have the action/adventure in it that grabs you by the tail and makes you want to finish the book all at that moment. Bilbo, a short, independent hobbit has been chosen, without further notice, to be the burgler of an up coming quest. His 13 companions are dwarves that lead him into the dangers of the Lonely Mountain, but that is not the only obsticle he'll hve to over come, for he has to get there too. If you would like to find out what happens to Bilbo and his truthful leaders then go ahead and read this book, but I would not recommend it."
4,Review on The Hobbit,"The Hobbit is an amazing book full of adventure and fantasy. It is so rich in adventure. It is a story of a hobbit named Bilbo who goes on a treasure hunt. They face trolls, goblins, and a dragon. On this adventure, though, Bilbo finds a ring. The One Ring. The One Ring is important in the next book: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring."
5,Great Book,"An awesome book! The Hobbit pulls you in every step of the way. Action Packed and full of Drama. A tale of a young Hobbit called Bilbo. You go with him, Gandalf the Wizard, and 12 other dwarves on an amazing adventure to slay the evil dragon Smaug and regain the Lost Treasures of the Dwarves! A MUST HAVE!"
5,BEST BOOK EVER!,This book was awesome. J.R. Tolkien does a great job of taking charcters such as dwarves and hobbits and creates a land about those creatures fighting for supreme rule. I would strongly recommend this book for people that enjoy fantasy.
4,Not Too Bad,"I thought that The Hobbit was a good read. I had to read it for school, and I usually like the books that I read in school and this was no exception. Tolkien managed to grab my attention in key parts of the novel where it was getting a little boring to spice up the story. The story was interesting for the plot and the author didn't make the plot boring. Overall, a good read."
2,Best of a Bad Lot,"Of all the Hobbit play adaptations, this one comes closer than the rest to capturing the feel and essential events. Of course some trimming is to be expected - staging the whole book would not only take hours but be prohibitively expensive for all but the wealthiest theatres. Gray still changes a bit too much for this purist's taste. (I don't understand why any playwrite wouldn't simply trust the author when adapting a book, especially a book as established as The Hobbit.) It IS the authorized adaptation, but then it was written at a time when Tolkien was worried about unauthorized copies of his work, so I can imagine him signing off on anything that came close, just to be sure his rights were being protected. He was also no fan of theatre, so I can't picture him taking any dep interest in this play."
5,"Witty, yet adventurous!","Wow! This book is a J.R.R Tolkien masterpiece! A tale about a small mythical creature (a hobbit) named Bilbo Baggins who despises adventures. He soon is on a perilous hunt with dwarves and Gandalf (a wise wizard always showing calm judgement) searching for their ancestors' treasure: a magical, mysterious and powerful ring. If you aren't a consistent reader and/or claim that you hate reading and always will hate it... This book will change all of your pessimistic judgements towards reading! If you love action... this book is for you! If you love humor... this book is for you! If you love adventure... this book definitely is for you! I urge you to go out and buy this amazing J.R.R. Tolkien masterpiece. I guarentee it will turn all of you pessimistic readers out there into voracious readers! That is why I give this book... 5 stars."
1,Not as good as the original,"Just not the same as Stevie Nicks. She is a legend, the ""chicks"" are not. The biggest thing they are remembered for at this point are their communist comments about our government."
5,It's better than players!,"Client likes to see professional guy, work and professional tools! It's doing connecting the faster connectors with cable. I recommend for You."
3,Never use it,"This seemed like a great idea, especially after I had difficulty removing an F-connector (coax cable) from the back of a cable box. however, this tool is a little bulky and can be tough to get in tight places. I'm better off most of the time just using my vise-grips or other pliers. I guess if you are doing dozens of F-Connectors at once this might save your fingers some cramping."
3,Dilogun leaves one half full.,"I read this book and was left wanting. The translations of the Yoruba prayers were not accurate and the language is key when making prayers/ incantation.Also the author seems to be rewriting the history of Lukumi, he totally left out the Ifa priests, who, without their contribution there would be no Santeria, Lukumi, etc.The interpretation of the dilogun takes a lot more than just memorizing refrains and a few apataki. There is a cultural and philosophical piece that is missing in this otherwise well written book. As a priest and diviner I could not recommend this book to people for a true understanding of the oracles of the Orisha."
3,It's a readable book for beginners,This book is good for people who are beginning to learn about the religion but the down side is that is does not provide information for those who are well aquainted with the religion.
3,Kyocera battery TXBAT10099,"I purchased this as a replacement for my Kyocera cell phone. The original battery that came with the phone did not last as long as I had hoped (less than 1 year). It quit holding a charge. I am hoping that this one lasts longer. I will make sure not to take the phone into humid conditions. This item was very well-priced, and I received it quickly and well-packaged from the seller."
5,Excellent Book - Especially for Beginners,I ordered this book because I needed a quick and dirty explanation of how to write socket programs in C. The text was straight to the point and explained to me everything I needed to know.
3,Powershot Accessory Kit,Camera case is much much smaller than I expected and unattractive but functional. No problems with the batteries or charger so far.
2,Carry Case and Battery Charger for Powershot Canon S3,The carry case is a big uncool thing. You need to be a great manager to habdle the carry case. Hardly your SD card holds in it. No strap to hold the case. You need to use camera's strap. Not worth of the money spent. The design seems to be 50 years old. I am not happy with the product. Recommend no buy.
4,The Commercial Greenhouse,"This is a good book, written as a first or second year college text book. It covers many topics associated with commercial greenhouse operations in a general manner, with a few topics covered in greater depth. It is informative and worth having on your shelf if your considering a commercial greenhouse operation."
4,good service for text books,I am a returning college student and have ordered textbooks from amazon before and have always received very good service.
5,great shirt,"it was my boyfriend's valentine's day present and he loved it. he wears it often and i enjoy seeing him love the shirt i got him. thanks company. you did well. oh yeah, i ordered it a few days before v-day so i was scared it would not get here in time, but it did. they have excellent shipping"
1,You get what you pay for.,Information outdated. Instructions vague and general. Don't waste your money.
4,good but incoplete,i THINK TECHNICAL DESCRIPTIONS AND MATERIAL SPECIFICATIONS ARE INCOMPLETE? BUT THE OVERALL EXPLANATIONS ARE GOOD
1,It's all flash powder,"Most of these recipes are for flash powder, which you don't need this book for. Also the making of flash powder is HIGHLY illegal. Trying to purchase the chemicals for flash powder (KCLO3 or KCLO4 and aluminum powder)is VERY restricted. Pyro companies will not sell to you if they think you are trying to make flash powder. Don't waste your money on this book"
5,A professional's guide to pyrotechnics,this book tells u info in great detail leaving out no information what so ever
3,"Simple, basic Flash-Powder formulas & Containment for same","The author provides simple, basic Flash-Powder formulas & containment proceedures for those deflagrants. In-a-nutshell this book provides factual, abiet basic, formulas that are not unique but proven. The author points to the need for containment of deflagarents so as to provide noise making ability.However; there is nothing new, exciting, unique, here. If you are looking for a unique oxcidizer, and profoundly new fuel, a deflagrent which is so uncommon that it's workings are worth study then you need to attend a sound graduate chem program in a hard science oriented university.If you want to make firecrackers; you can't beat this book."
3,Made in China (smells like a chemical factory),"I received what I ordered and it functions well. However, I wish I could buy things that were not made in China and smell like a chemical factory."
2,Cheap but probably not worth it,I am small compared to most of the population and maybe I can say the size is sufficient for me but it won't be for most. The cover material is strange and there is less support than a previous cushion that I had owned and then lost. It was inexpensive but still not worth getting. I have it and use it in my car though I am disappointed in it. I would think twice before you buy it.
3,Duro Med Sloping Coccyx Cussion,This product did not help my pain level at all but it did boost me higher in the car. I have a different nerve issue that I was hoping this would help but it didn't.
4,My butt feels better,I am sitting on my Coccyx Cushion as I type this review. It really does help. I wish I had one for every chair.
4,It's better than nothing,"Here's the deal folks. It's not a cure all, it's only a pad for your rear end. It helps and I would rather use it than not use it but it won't change your life. It may however ease the pain for short term use. It has for me and I am glad that I bought it. Is it perfect? No. Does it help a bit? Yes."
2,Coccyx Cushion,"The chusion is better than nothing, but would perform much better if it were firmer. Unfortunately, the cushion tends to compress therefore limiting the amount of support it provides. I would recommend that you look for a firmer cushion if you have a tailbone injury like me."
2,"chose because of the good reviews, but.............","I chose this cushion because of the good reviews it got.It arrived today and it goes almost completely flat when I sit on it.I weigh 172lbs. It feels like it could be from the dollar store.I wouldn't have purchased it if I saw it in person first.Well, hopefully it still helps a tiny bit with tailbone pain."
1,worthless,I have back pain and I was desperate to try anything to alleviate the pain while sitting at my desk.This cushion was awkward to sit on.. but still I tried. After about 2 weeks it was flat when I sat on it.
1,too soft,This coccyx pad is way too soft and therefore compresses to a point where it isn't much benefit to relieve pressure on the tailbone. I weigh 180 lbs. Its filmsy and I guess that is what you get for the low price. I had to upgrade to a Tush Cush which helps much more.
1,Veto,It is to small and the material is too hard. Not a good product at all. what a terrible experience buying this cushion.
1,Don't buy this product.,I bought this and I deeply regret it.It is the same as if you had nothing. Don't waste your time and money on this crap.I can not believe that amazon sells such a terrible product. The good reviews that you see is probably from people that are family of the seller.Just hate this thing.
3,OK on some surfaces,"I ordered this because I have tailbone pain. I found that it does relieve pressure and some pain when on a cushioned surface more than on hard surfaces. For instance, on my chair at work...great...on a hard plastic bucket chair- not so much."
3,works for me,"I find this cushion comfortable, though I am only 120 lbs and I can see how someone heavier than myself would probably sink into it- the material is ok- it works for me, for now"
2,Duro-Med sloping coccyx cushion,It doesn't slope much i.e. it feels like the cushion is the same thickness in front as the back when sitting on it. It's too small for my tush. Can my tush be that big?
3,you need to learn how to sit on it,"Basically it helps. But you do need to learn the correct way for yourself to sit on it. If you move all the stress from your tailbone to your lower back as I did, it would be no fun. So you have to learn how to balance, a subtle way to make both your tainlbone and your back ok."
1,They Changed the Design For the Worse,"I bought two of these last year and they're great. They're thick and fit normal sized chairs. I love them. So, I ordered two more. But the company changed the design: thinned the cushions out and made them much wider. I have bulging discs in my back and these new ones are not adequate while the old ones are great. I don't know what the manufacturers were thinking. Most of the excellent reviews on here probably come from when this product rocked."
5,Used Daily,This pillow is the neatest thing I have ever bought. My husband uses it every time we go anywhere in the car. It works wonderfully for him. I would recommed this pillow for anyone who problems riding for any distance. It has been a blessing.
2,Works - but not really what you want.,The good:Slanted designThe bad:Foam is too soft so if you weigh more than 100lbs you will likely compress the foam down to 1/3 of an inch or less.Conclusion - buy a different product with a better foam quality.
4,Good,My 95 year old mother does not have enough meat on her seat to protect her tail bone. She loves this cushion.
3,Somewhat disappointed,"Much softer than I expected, but it does the job. Not usable in the front seats of a car that has form fitting seats...and most do these days. I think I rather would have a thinner one with no slope to it."
3,Just OK,I am pregnant and got this hoping it would help with pain I'm having in my tail bone. So far it is just OK. I really don't notice a significant improvement with my pain. The cushion is already flattening out and I've only had it a couple weeks. It helps a little but not as much as I'd hoped.
2,Go with something else if your plus size,I have a cracked tailbone and thought this would work but it was awful! It went completely flat after the first time of use but I am over 170lbs as well. Maybe it would work for someone much smaller. For the price I couldn't expect to much from it but I thought I would at least try.
2,Not Recommended for Those Over 105 lbs,"I was just looking for a cushion for my hard chair and bought this one b/c it was cheap. Although I do have disc problems, I really can't tell whether this cushion is making a difference for that. What I can tell though is that the cushion is very soft and provides very little support.I'm 5'1"" and just under 110 lbs, and the cushion only barely provides any cushioning for my bum. Over the course of about 2 months, the cushion gets even flatter so that what little support it had in the first place (which was actually acceptable to me as I didn't need a lot of cushioning) is now almost non-existent.My 6"", 185lb boyfriend tried it and he said he flattened down to nothing.I've since purchased the Tush Cush, which is more expensive, but is way firmer. It's actually a ""firm"" cushion. Time will tell whether the firmness of the Tush Cush works for me (it might be TOO firm) but my bet is that for most adults, the Tush Cush is going to work way better."
4,NICELY MADE,"LOOKS DURABLE, NICE MATERIAL, I AM SATISFIED WITH THE PURCHASE AND WOULD RECCOMMEND IT TO OTHERS. REALLY HELPED ME ON RECENT LONG CAR TRIP."
3,Its Ok.,My Wife and I are truckers and we bought this because we needed a replacement cushion for our old one from 2 years. Its small size doesn't really fit any chair let alone our seat in our truck. It slides everywhere and needs constant adjustment. But once in the right place it is confortable. But A real pain in the butt if you know what I mean.
4,good inexpensive cushion,"the cushion works well, probably better for average weight people (I'm about 180). I have had it for several months and use it regularly. It is holding up well and the price was very fair."
4,Works pretty well.,"I ordered this and another cushion because I am desperate to get some relief while sitting. This one places me a little high in the seat. The cut-out area is nicely sized, though. With the other one, you have to be right on target since the hole is so small. The cushion is also softer. This product is clearly the winner and I will probably order a few more."
1,Rubbermaid Quality?,"This sink mat is AWFUL. I am so disappointed in the quality of this product, the mat stains and curls up in sink. You cannot remove the stains from it and it feels slimy all the time. I had used Rubbermaid for years but will no longer buy their products. This product is just unbelievable. Now I complained to Rubbermaid about this and they sent me a coupon for six dollars but my question to Rubbermaid is how do I buy a decent sink mat with the coupon as they make junk now. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!"
4,A good way to get into Daredevil,"i'm about halfway through this collection, and it's not so bad. it does have that kinda corny 60s dialogue, but that's the way comics were back then. i am twenty years old, and i just started reading comics. when i was younger, i watched all the cartoons and collected the cards, but i never actually read the comics. now that i have started, i've realized how worth reading all of these comics are! anyway, if you want to start getting into Daredevil, this would be a good collection to read. once you get past it, i would read some of the issues that Frank Miller wrote. those are supposed to be some of the best. as a new comic-reader, i am open to reccomendations of good comics that i should read. if anyone has anything they think i should read, please let me know.this has been Apollyon"
1,No vale la pena,"Definitivamente NO vale la pena, no pretendo hacerle mal a nadie, pero este producto en particular se daña en seguida....la parte que se introduce en el prendedor de cigarros del carro es muy sencilla y al parecer se daña con facilidad."
2,For students,"If I were a student still in architecture school this book may have been useful. However, to a professional this book has little to offer."
4,Awesome...,"I love to play piano, and i love this muscials piano pieces, so i was surprised to find this piano book from Amazon so cheap! For so much. Good job, Amazon! ps... it got here amazingly fast."
5,What a great book!,"This is one of the best vocal selections I have seen in terms of difficulty. It gives me a decent quality where I don't have to play the melody when being an accompanist. However, it doesn't always follow the 1997 CD... Some things were made simpler, like ""In His Eyes"" that is missing some crutial piano notes. I applaud Cherry Lane's job on ""Facade"" and ""Murder, Murder!"" which are both excellent piano versions.If only there could be a vocal score for this..."
1,Worthless in my situation,"I lost everything on my desktop, which is to say 90 percent of the information I had stored on my 3-month-old iMac G5.It happened when I tried to open a file on the desktop by double clicking on it. Everything on the desktop except the hard drive icon just disappeared.An hour on the phone with an Apple tech proved fruitless. He recommended Data Rescue.I downloaded the demo version, ran it, and came up with nothing. Nevertheless, I ordered the software (from Amazon).I tried it again, this time making the scans after starting up from the disk. I tried the ""Thorough Scan"" and the Content Scan.""Each scan took 30-45 minutes to perform and turned up nothing. Oddly enough, when the scans were complete my screen looked as if I had never done them. There was not even a report saying nothing was found.I guess Data Rescue works well in many situations, but it was a waste of money in my case."
1,Doesn't work with damaged drives,"This turned out to be more money down the pit. A 250GB WD drive with 3 partitions failed on me, and this product was unable to get more than a few tiny (3MB or less) files from it. Data Rescue X has big problems when it hits a ""bad"" sector, locking up for a very long time. Out of 140 video files of 50MB up to 1.5GB, only about 8 seconds of the first one was recovered after about 10 hours of processing. In that time the ""time left"" counter just kept on going up and up until it was into the millions of minutes time left. It just couldn't get past the first file. Very disappointed."
1,Awful service from the seller,"I bought this product on 8/31/10. According to the seller delivery time would be between 8 and 14 days. The book arrived 9/23/10, almost a month later. After 10 days waiting for the book,I emailed seller asking if was there any way I could get a faster delivery. The only answer I got was a generic one that did not answer my question. Twenty three days later, at least something good: the book came in a good condition."
4,awesome!,loved the songs!! she has a really good voice. A MUST HAVE if you like D.H.T or dance-pop kind of music.
3,Get it off Napster To Go first...,"...'Cuz once you've heard 'every time we touch', 'Another You', and 'Ready for Love', you'll hear the resemblance each song has to the next and last. I downloaded this album and DJ Encore's 'Intuition' the same day. While Cascada again sounded a bit redundant after a while, There was PLENTY of difference between each and every track on 'Intuition'. I didn't see as much diversity as I was hoping here - guess my hope was based on the hype.I LOVE Cascada's voice, and the overall style is pretty original. As a DJ, I love using ETWT to keep a dance floor going, and I hope that artists like Cascada, DJ Sammy, D.H.T., and Ian Van Dahl pave the way for more trance music to start hitting airwaves. I'll probably buy the disc on principal, but I don't think it'll land on the 'most played tracks' on my MP3 player."
1,Worst Dance Album Ever,"This album is horrible. If you already have ""Everytime We Touch"", then save yourself some time and money. Listen to the song 14 times and you'll have the album. Every song sounds exactly the same; it's as if they mixed one beat and she made up a bunch of different lyrics to go with it. It actually hurt to listen each next song. The covers aren't even worth it. I couldn't agree more with a previous review stating that this is the last thing the dance genre needs. Most people complain they can't stand the genre because it all sounds alike. Well, this is the kind of crap that gives it a bad name. All we're going to get from Cascada is a bunch of 15 year old teenie boppers reminiscing about the days of Hanson. Check out fusionradiochicago.com for some good stuff."
3,Cascada- Everytime We Touch,"I like the album and if you like the title track you'll love the rest of the them. Since, this was their first record I was happy with it, but not thrilled. First of all there is a lack of words on many of the songs and that is filled in by long musical breaks. Good for dancing, not so good for just listening to. Also a lot of the songs sound alike (Which isn't suprising considering the fact that it was thrown together in six months). But, most importantly I didn't care for two of the songs. The ballad 'Another You' and 'Kids in America' (I never liked this song very much anyway and Cascada does make it better). So, as a fan of Cascada I say get it, just don't expect it to be anything more then a fun dance album."
3,Finally got it. :),"Well it took a really long time to get here, but it got here in the time it alloted for when it would arrive. To make up for that though, it was in GREAT condition for the price! :) Will order again from here soon!"
4,First time,"I've never heard of Cascada before but I was watching a YouTube video and they used one of these songs and I really liked it. It's really upbeat and makes you wanna dance. My favorite tracks are ""Bad Boy"", ""Miracle"", ""Can't Stop the Rain"", and ""Kids In America"". All of these songs are on repeat on my iPod :D. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because ome of the songs sound alike. They're kinda repetative.A lot of the songs are about love and they aren't like ""run of the mill"" stuff. They aren't cheesy and the lyrics are different then what you'd find today. Overall, I think this is a must buy."
2,75 used CD's?..,"Wow, that must mean something. Good thing I downloaded this album. I'd like to start off with the hit ""Everytime We Touch"". It's gotten old, but I didn't like it that much anyway. The synthesizers after the choruses follow the melody line almost exactly. I think maybe there would be a better remix other than the Candlelight one (that, on the other hand..is quite pretty). The remakes, especially ""Truly Madly Deeply"" should have been left alone. ""How do you Do!"" was quite catchy. And I did enjoy ""Miracle."" Other songs were made for me to push the skip button on my CD player. This is NOT techno, it's more of a vocal trance/dance album. This album was okay at best, definitely not my cup of tea."
4,Fun dance numbers and a few ballads in between,"I liked Cascada's first album! It's more than Everytime We Touch, as the album has such strong high energy dance numbers like Bad Boy, my favorite, Kids in America and others. She slows it down on a few ballads. I like her remake of Truly, Madly, Deeply more than the somewhat dull original by Savage Garden that adult contemporary stations and stores love to play. Sometimes, her singing on the ballads screams Kelly Clarkson's more tender vocal approach. But the dance numbers move so fast that you really have to keep up--crunching, beat heavy,rhythmic 3-minute numbers of Euro dance music that they recorded in France! This is good escapism music to get you up and dancing, very uniquely and creatively done! Cascada adds her own touches to the songs to keep them from becoming repetitive, such as some sexy talk and come-ons a la Madonna. She's that good a singer too over the aggressive numbers."
1,The Same Sound the Whole Time!,"Ok first off, when you listen to ""Everytime We Touch"" you're done because the rest of the cd is EXACTLY the same. I have tried and tried to listen to the whole cd, but I just couldn't. It's very annoying to listen to!"
1,Worst song recorded in the last 15 years,"""Everytime we touch"" while a cover song from 1992, comes across to me as a spoof of early 90's techno it's so bad. Every element of the song is a dead on knockoff of the early 90's dance genre. Laughably bad."
3,"Good album, but it is not the best of Cascada",I bought this album with Evacuate the Dancefloor and Perfect Day. I prefer the other two to this one.
5,My entire family is in love with Cascada!,"I had never heard of Cascada before we took a drive with one of our grown daughters. She had the CD playing and within minutes the entire car-full was singing along. We enjoyed it so much that we delayed getting out just so that we could finish the CD *laughs* I went right home and looked it up on Amazon and bought it. I recieved it within days and immediately downloaded it to my computer and my MP3 player. Now it's the most listened to tracks on both! The upbeat sounds are perfect for working out or cleaning house. I live in a mountain community near a lake. When I'm listening to Cascada, I can walk the 3 mile lap around the lake in nothing flat. Trust me, if you have the opportunity to listen to this CD, or better yet, buy it... Don't hessitate. You will love what you hear!"
5,We need more Firesign!,"A great up-to-date Firesign work that brings the group into today's current events. Martha Stewart, Ashcroft, Iraq War, terrorist, and all relevant news are all covered. They are as good as ever and still better than the majority of comedy that is out there. Their razor sharp cutting edge satire is still the best!"
5,You either get Firesign Theater or you don't,"Truly the theater of the absurd! I loved these guys from the first time i heard them. All I can say is you either get what they do or you don't. Some of their humor is a bit hard to follow and some of the live bits are harder still without visuals to go along with the dialog. Chances are, if you are reading this you already have some familiarity with them. This piece is no different than their others. They haven't missed a beat. As a fan, this would be a satisfactory addition. If you are a newby to them I would recommend either The Giant Rat of Sumatra, Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him, or Don't Crush That Dwarf, Hand me the Pliers. If you get those, onward into the fog!!!!!"
1,All things awful,"Firesign Theatre wordplay: ""Dr. Happy Harry Cox;"" ""CNN No Evil;"" ""The First Deformed Church of Science, Fiction;"" and ""It's Saddam Shame."" And the word ""uniform"" used as both a noun AND an adjective in the space of a single routine.Firesign Theatre satire: ""Frankenstein's monsters"" genetically bred by the Department of Homeland Defense; cable TV as a Halloween-style haunted house attraction called ""Cabletown;"" and an ad for a car which runs on ""theories about dinosaurs,"" dinosaur toys, and Godzilla videos. Also, ""Ma and Pa Kettle""-style rural characterizations.Miscellaneous: An entire routine devoted to synonyms for ""manure;"" a Thanksgiving allegory of some kind in which Indians change into Asians and Pilgrims into ""Africans.""You have been warned."
4,2nd Hand Good deal,This item was used near new condition very cheap in price Seller sent it quickly and wrapped well Fast delivery I am very pleased.
4,better than expected,I like having different options on how to play especially having an opportunity to play someone online.
3,"Good Game, Intrusive Setup","The game itself is enjoyable. However, I didn't like having to play against a timer, and there's no option to remove the time constraint, so I took one star off for that.Another complaint I have is that the installer puts both the game and an online interface onto your computer. You don't have a choice about whether or not to install the online component, and that application immediately begins trying to download other games onto your computer -- again, without any authorization from you. I took another star off for this. In fact, once I discovered I couldn't play the game without this unwanted additional component, I uninstalled the entire thing.For a good jewel matching game, I recommend Bejeweled 2."
3,game,My nephew loves it along with the other jewel quest games. He is trying to beat his uncles up score
5,Jewel Quest 2,"I love this game, it's addicting and very entertaining. This seller went the extra mile to get it to me because it had to be sent twice. The first time, it seems to have gotten lost in the mail somewhere. The second time was a charm. Thank you so much for making sure that I received it. I play it everyday."
1,Use the right picture and description,I also purchased this because I wanted a car charger that did not trquire the adapter. needless to say I will not be buying from them again.
1,Why buy this when you can buy that?,"Why spend $43.00 on Jim's spring compression tool nut when you can buy barnetts sping compression tool nut, and diaphragm which you will need to complete the tool and job for $40.00 total. Jims wants an additional $60 plus for the diaphragm. Do the math.Barrett's tool worked beautifully. Thanks Barnett great tool, great price!!!"
2,Not what it seems,"This book would be fine if you just arrived in the US from a third world country and wanted to learn what a home security system was. It would be a useful guide to someone wanting to hire a contractor to install a system. It was of little use, however, to someone wanting to actually install a system. I kept thinking I was going to get to the chapter that discussed wiring in series or in parallel. Or a discussion on daisy chain, or home run. I never did. In fact, there is no mention of these (or other little items like resistors) even in the glossary. It's not a bad book, it's just not a ""how to"" book."
2,Where's the Beef?,If you are looking for general / superficial information about security systems then you have come to the right place. The book just didn't have enough real world experience with security systems. It did point you toward providers of basic home security systems like ADT but did not provide very much insight that a good reviewer of the product should have.
1,Cheap pliers,"Straight out of the packet and one pair had a wobble on the hinge. On another one, the end where you grip something, the ends are two different sizes! I also found the packaging to be excessive. Not happy with this item."
2,Very low quality,"I knew the quality would not be great but these are really really cheaply made. Some of the hinges barely move, others are looser. The small 7"" pliers don't even have teeth ground in them. I bet if I went with Neiko ones they would be better quality for a similar price. I feel like I could have gotten a similar quality set for half the price somewhere else."
4,Too bad it's out of print!,"This book told the story of the CSS Alabama and the USS Kearsarge. I read it growing up and have never been able to find it since. If you can find it, read it--it is a good read and a good history lesson on the naval tactics employed during the Civil War."
2,The 290 A Disappointment,"This is a very thin little book. While it does stick to the facts to a point,the author has his character leave the ship for an extentded length of time and is therefore able to skip much of what happened to the Alabama. He does very little to develop the characters. I was sorry I wasted my time and money.Bruce B."
3,Title does not reflect content,The All Americans more of a sports story than a bio of several athlete/soldiers and to much arcane details that only a coach or a diehard jock would enjoy.....I bought on the idea of getting a bio of several who were successes on the gridiron and also in the military. This was not delivered.
1,Awful,"This book is generally about football players killing people. Really, this is just terrible. Crude violence and a boring game."
3,so so...,"My boyfriend bought this shampoo to help thicken his hair. It seems to be helping, and the hair isn't falling out as much. The only problem is that if he uses it without alternating with Head and Shoulders, he gets really bad dandruff. I believe the shampoo is drying out his scalp, but he will continue to use it while alternating with Head and Shoulders."
3,"I Know, I Know",They didn't include Idle Moments on this collection because it was on the four disc Joe Henderson set from around a decade ago. I get it. But seriously- how can you have a best of early Blue Note Grant Green and not include Idle Moments? It's kind of like putting out a Beatles singles collection and leaving off Strawberry Fields Forever. What? Oh bother!
3,in Color?,"I bought the Original Slinky in color but it was just metal, no color when I received it. I didn't see an option to choose a color from the place I bought it from."
2,Where's the color?,"I ordered one of these 2 weeks ago and received a blue slinky which was a really nice blue and fun to play with. I ordered 2 more after that and they just came in today. Well when I opened the package, I was disappointed to see two regular metal slinkies (no color). Granted slinkies are fun and all, but I specifically ordered from this vendor in hopes of receiving at least one colored slinky. This is the main reason that I gave this product 2 stars. Otherwise, slinkies are the best."
2,Disappointed,"I wish I would have read the reviews, but being a Slinky, I didn't think I had to. I, too, ordered this because of the color; and, I too, received a plain metal one. I would have chosen a less expensive version if I just wanted a gray, metal toy. Of course now they are out of stock and don't know if they will be back in stock. I'm extremely disappointed."
1,not a slinky,"i ordered this thinking i was getting a colored slinky. instead i get some coupe body frame car?! thats not what i ordered, it never said anything about cars. i'm going through some bad times right now and really wanted a green slinky, to help give my mind a break. i am very dissapointed."
1,Not Gluten Free,"This product was listed with a special gluten free foods promotion. I am glad I read the ingredients first! Although these cookies sound wonderful, buyer beware! They are not and if you are buying for someone with allergies or intolerances this would not be a wise choice."
3,no banana flavor,This is a very moist and tastey cookie but I purchased the banana walnut and there isn't a drop of banana taste in it. It tastes more like a spice cookie but it's good. Lots of healhty indgedients and I would have given it 5 stars if it had tasted like it was named.
5,One of my favorite flavors- tastes great!,"I like the Erin Baker breakfast cookies, but some of the flavors are way too sweet for me. This one (along with Morning Glory and Pumpkin Spice) is one of my favorite flavors. It tastes great, is not too sweet, and makes a delicious quick breakfast. Wonderful with coffee (or tea). Relatively healthy choice (whole grains and 300 calories) and very tasty. I keep mine frozen as they suggest (you must do this or they may get mold), microwave for about 33 seconds and they always taste fresh. Also good using a toaster (crispy crust). Very handy and convenient."
4,pretty good,I'm part of the cliff bar mafia but I decided to give these a try. They were actually pretty damn good. I like to toast mine and down with milk and coffee. I will probably get more. I wish the stores carried them.
1,moldy,The label said they expire in 2011 but they were moldy. I swear to God I ate them right out of the package and it wasn't until I had only 3 left that I took one fully out and saw the top of it covered in mold. Will never buy again. They're lucky I didn't get sick and sue their ases
4,good but other flavors are better,"This not my favorite flavor but still very good. My 15 month old son loves them and they are very nutritious too. I prefer oatmeal raisin and apple pie, but this is good too. Just don't like the peanut butter (too nuts and twigs tasting)."
2,Love the cookie; hate the mold.,I've been eating these very good cookies for years. My last order had a bunch of moldy cookies. I accidentally ate part of one and it did not taste so good. :( I've e-mailed customer support at Erin Baker's with no reply yet. [...] I purchased the product in August 2010.
4,Great quick breakfast item,"We first got introduced to Erin Baker's breakfast cookies on an airline several years ago. We were impressed w/the texture, flavor and size. We looked them up onine and started buying them 2 - 4 dozen at a time to keep in the freezer for trips and something to grab quickly when we don't have much time for breakfast. They keep extremely well in the freezer. We enjoy several flavors, particularly Fruit & Nut, Morning Glory, Oatmeal Raisin and Banana Walnut. I didn't care for the Peanut butter Chocolate Chip much."
3,Breakfast Cookie,"Soft, filling...someone forgot the Bananas...will not repurchase. Each person will have to judge for themselves but cannot recommend."
5,Put in fridge immediately!!!,These cookies have no preservatives so you better put them in the fridge right away.Plus they the fridge keeps them from drying out I think.The Banana Walnut and Fruit & Nut are my favorites so far.These are all-natural and hearty. They are NOT soft or chewy (unless maybe you microwave them).
2,flavor free is not a way I'd start like to start the day,"I bought this 12 pack so that I would have no excuse to skip breakfast anymore; it has a great list of healthy ingredients, under 300 calories, freezer storage is recommended/preferred which means pretty much always fresh stock on hand, toast-able, and easy to grab and go. Along with the other list of pluses and pros, these are *very* filling. The con happens to be the taste - very little banana flavor at all. Mostly a sort of bland, vague flavor that I would have to label as ""fiber"" since it did not taste all that much like anything.Baker's Breakfast Cookies tend to get high marks and I would definitely try a different flavor if these weren't so expensive, but unfortunately this flavor (or lack of it) has me a little reluctant to invest another morning or dollar in this brand."
5,love,"I got these for those busy mornings and they are so worth it! Easy, fun, tasty and healthier then that Breakfast Bar!"
4,Very handy!!,"Bought this for my iPaq and immediately had to go on a trip. It works really well for charging and using the iPaq, but it was a little tempermental to seat the plug into the power connector in my husband's truck, not sure if the problem is with the truck or with the adapter, we'll see.Otherwise though it works great!"
3,Actually 3 1/2 stars....,"Much better than The Dawning, another Leisure line novel. Cave creates a good plot, believeable characters, and the story flows smoothly until the climaxI am a new reader of Cave's and enjoy his writing style which is simple but powerful. Unlike so many writers, he does not overwrite and uses a clear and concise voice to express his thoughts.He uses words like darts and creates intense imagery that lets you see the action as it unfolds and is a good dialogue writer as well. Cave is simply a writer with a vision and knows how to detail his research of the occult and witchcraft.Keep it up, Mr Cave. Two thumbs way way up!"
5,Some of Cain's best work!,"I've been a fan of Michael Cain since his days with Jack DeJohnette, and while his solo debut album Circa (on ECM) was great, I think Brooklyn Waters is some of his best work ever, and certainly his best recording under his own name. Not to ignore Pheeroan akLaff, by any means, his playing meshes wonderfully with Cain's, and you can tell that these two know each other well. Also, this isn't mentioned above, but the album contains only original music by Cain and akLaff, with some pieces co-written, and the two seem all the more inspired to jam on their own compositions. Plus the CD is beautifully packaged, with an attention to detail that you don't see often with a jazz album. Check it out!"
4,"Review of ""The Shrubs and Woody Vines of Florida: A Reference and Field Guide""",The Shrubs and Woody Vines of Florida: A Reference and Field Guide is an excelent field guide. I recommend it. Great alyour and design. Very informative.
3,Deceiving Cover,"I bought the book off the shelf in a book store based on the cover. The cover shows photos of hand signs leading people to believe that is how all the signs are presented. They are not! The book on the shelf was sealed in plastic, so it wasn't until I got it home that I discovered the all signs are presented in cartoon form. The material itself is easy to understand and use. But if you're buying this book based on the presumption it uses photos to present the signs then this is not the book you want."
4,The ASL handshape starter,The book is organized well. It helps while learning the basics of ASL.The pictures took a while to get used to.
5,Great reference,"I am a beginner and this book works like a dictionary. I selected this book because with each word there was a picture and a description of proper hand movement. I purchased this book as well as a few other books, and have been successful in learning ASL.I would recommend the seller, as the transaction was prompt and I got what I expected."
4,excellent 80's rock!!,"Rough Cutt-was one of those bands that never fully got the recognition deserved. I dont know how I heard of this band but I did and am glad to have been around to hear when it came out..1985-6..the production on WANTS YOu is so intune to the era..hard rock with flairing guitars and heavy pounding drums. Paul Shotino is impeccable in his approach to singing..like a cross between David Coverdale,Paul rodgers. Plenty of shreading guitar-to satisfy any 80's metal diehard! very similar to VAN HALEN,Dokken,Tesla,Bad Company..the stand out song for me on this disc is ""HOT N HEAVY"" AMAZING vocals guitar solo riffs everything!!! WANTS YOU is a CLASSIC 80's Metal cd!! CLASSIC!!"
4,Love This Band,This is a good Hard Rock band that failed to make it big but still wrote good songs. You get everything they recorded for cheep money. It is worth a listen.
5,YES!,"When I saw this was available, I ordered it without hesitation. I still know every song by heart.Rough Cutt woulda shoulda coulda been huge. Great, great band. Saw them live in Boston more than once."
2,Throwaway Mid-80s Mainstream Metal,"Despite having two top shredders and a great vocalist in their ranks and being championed by the Metal God himself (Dio), this band had actually very little going for it. You won't get more than pretty generic mid 80's mainstream metal rockers and schmaltzy ballads in this collection: the kind of music tons of bands were doing at the time, but with better songs and much more charm. A tell-tale sign of Rough Cutt's ultimate lack of appeal and how dated their music sounds is the fact that the best song here is a Janis Joplin cover. If you're a serious 80s metal collector, this CD might be a good deal, otherwise, pass."
4,classic rocks thats great,"Inever heard of rough cutt in the day , but i whished i had.This band is fantastic ,as many of the reviewers said.Paul shortino has a great voice ,and the ryhtm section is fantastic.I cant put a finger on who they sound like ,but there still fantastic.From take her,to janice joplins piece of my heart,to black widow ,todouble trouble,these songs are well written and played.If you are looking for a great cd try these two buy rough cutt,by the way there cheap"
4,I can't believe they released this!,I've been trying to get these albums for years. Great singer and songs. One of the great undiscovered bands of the 80's.
2,"Incomplete, not recommended especially the beginner","This was the first reference book I purchased when I began collecting depression glass. Although there are color photos, few patterns are represented. The patterns of manufacturers are line listed at the end of the depression glass section but quite a few of the patterns are not represented in the detail (the most important) section of the book. Representation of the patterns detailed are in a very poor quality black and white, making it difficult to match a piece of glassware with the pattern. Although Kovel seems to be a well respected authority in a number of collectible arenas, I saw no sign of expertise in this book. I would not recommend this book to anyone especially beginners."
4,good watch,"A really good watch. I purchased my first one at Macy's then went a longtime looking for another as my first did get damaged over a period of time, just me dropping it several times.This is a solid good watch, its a bit heavy so if you do not like too much weight on your wrist just no it has some weight."
3,Elizabeth Furtwangler,This interesting documentary has some fascinating insights into the art of Wilhelm Furtwangler. It is well worth having if you are a Furtwangler enthusiast. The .mp3 files of his lectures and rehearsals are a great bonus. I found there to be a few too many long close-ups of Elizabeth's face. It would have been nice to know who the people were in the footage of the informal concert at her house. The excerpts of WF conducting Don Giovanni and rehearsing Schubert's Unfinished were beautifully restored. The footage of anonymous couples kissing did not add much to the content.
1,WARNING... Annoying!,"I love hosting dinner parties serving foods from around the world. I search far and wide for decorations, entertainment, and music to go with my meals that are native to the cultures. This could be such a neat series. It could have a couple recipes inside and a picture of people in native costume. Instead is such a waste of money and very disappointing, with none of those things. What's more, every single song on every single CD uses the same 4/4 beats and just repeats those notes over and over and over and over again throughout the song until you are subconsiously angonizing for the song to be over already. Then mercifully, before you go insane, the next song comes on (or you press the skip button and move it on) and while it is different from the one before it, has the same repetitive thing going on until you are bloody ready to smash the CD player with a baseball bat and call it good. Ugh!"
3,"Useful, but don't use this book as your sole source","As an American man who has been in a serious long-distance relationship with a Japanese woman for almost 5 years now, I found that this book helped me to understand a lot of things. I also, however, found the material to be somewhat dated. As a previous reviewer stated, I think that the book was somewhat unfair in its depictions of all parties involved in international relationships. I think this is a good resource for people in such a relationship, but that it should definately not be taken as a sole source. I think that the author had some pre-existing ideas and prejudices that she let shine through into her work, and the reader should keep this in mind while reading."
1,More fiction than fact,"The author has some opinions and does not conseal it. Although author makes a few valid points, overall the information is inaccurate, very dated, mostly based on stereotypes. I agree with some of the other reviewers that this book has a negative stance towards Western men/Japanese women relationships and idolizes Japanese men/Western women relationships. Considering that most marriages between Japanese men/Western women end in divorce, this is certainly not based on fact. The reality is that Japanese men/Western women marriages have over double the divorce rate of Western men/Japanese women marriages. The author should have done more research in writting this book rather than basing on her personal opinions."
3,A bit outdated with Hong Kongese bias.,"One point which is clear in the book and hasn't been mentioned is the viewpoint the author starts with. I have many friends from Hong Kong and Japan. The view of Japanese women from Hong Kong is not altogether great, while there can be some idolising, many women from Hong Kong can be quite bitter about Japanese women as they view them as being too feminine and very much kept by their men. They often believe that Japanese women never work hard and their looks frequently reply on plastic surgery. I think the author has this mix of idolising Japanese women as well as envying them or looking down on them."
2,Not a Toy - A Collector's Piece,For your motorhead who has everything - why not a model of the car they own/want?
4,Great Resource for information and exercises for instructors with clients with osteoporosis!,"In addition, to going over appropriate exercises for your clients with osteoporosis, this manual goes over what is osteoporosis, risk factors for it, its general treatment (bone strengthening and nutrition)and exercises to avoid with your clients. It also includes an appendix filled with useful resources and supplemental information for instructors and their clients.Exercises include being on the mat, chair, moonbox, cadallic, rotating discs, and ladder barrel. The exercises include clear explanations and step-by-step black and white pictures. In addition, Marika includes the purpose of the exercises, progressions, direction of resistance, and the bone benefits of each exercise.The downside of the book is in its design. It is spiral bounded so the pages started to fall out when I started to carry it to the various studios where I was working."
3,"This is ""comprehensive""? The author better look it up in a dictionary.","I was expecting more detailed examples beyond what every typical photoshop book has to offer, but it only delivered about 60% of what I was wanting. This book is nothing more than a Cliff Notes version of ""Mastering Black and White Digital Photography"" by Michael Freeman, which is truely a ""comprehensive"" exploration on the subject."
4,Making beautiful B & W photos from colour,"This excellent book shows a wide variety of coloured photographs taken by various professional and amateur photographers. It clearly explains how they can be improved upon by those who might appreciate or prefer the wonderful medium of B & W photography by manipulation in a graphics program, here, mainly Adobe Photoshop.The book is fairly concise but the better for it. It has a practicality about it which you can only tap into by serious application; a passionate joy for some, a chore for others.I have examined a number of books on the same theme; this is the better."
3,Should have packed an emotional whallop,"""Drowing towns"" I had never heard of such a thing and was highly interested in reading this book about a remarkable event in history.(Though apparently it has happened worldwide)To be honest .. I was disappointed. What should have been an emotional, impactful story turned out to be rather bland.The writing was choppy, (difficult to read out loud) pictures ho-hum (even though I love Barbara Cooney!) and the overall intensity was not there as I thought it should be. Afterall we are talking about people leaving the homes and their way of life that had been in their families for generations.I was expecting better. I think Patricia MacLachlan and Illustrator Ted Rand or Susan Jeffers could have made a real triumph out of this.That said, _DO_ read this book. It is a remarkable event in history and this book is still worth reading."
4,A look at Hillary as the Strength of the Couple,"Warner using Clinton's past interviews and comments from her friends and colleagues, details the evolution of the first lady from teenager to college student to lawyer, mother, activist, and politician's wife. Clinton's strong personality and intellect seem to have made her a success in her own right, and appear to be crucial elements in Bill Clinton's rise to the top. I would recommend that you read the newer Revised and Updated release of this book."
1,need an item,I am looking for a user guide for the etrex gps can you please let me know how to get one. Please respond.
4,A Good Introduction to Using a GPS Receiver,"This book was a useful introduction for someone who just got a GPS receiver. The first part of the book was a simple treatment of how the GPS system works. The second part dealt with how to work a receiver, something that is probably better handled by the user manual. Most of the book covered how to use GPS in the outdoors, going through several different examples as the pedagogical method. Perhaps the most useful aspect of the book was in understanding different grid systems, particularly UTM and longitute/lattitude."
4,Good introduction to GPS,"This is a great intro book for the novice looking to understand more about GPS. It is a good start for someone wanting to purchase their first GPS receiver, or someone who already has a receiver but wants to learn more about it. The info is presented in a clear, logical way, but it tends to be a bit basic for more advanced users. I was hoping to learn more about differential GPS and post processing of data for improved accuracy. The book gave general discriptions of both, but not a lot of detail. For instance, it did not explain, as I later discovered, that low-cost consumer receivers are not compatible with post processing. The compilation of commercial receivers is a bit dated, but most of the rest of the book is still very topical."
4,Essential and Practical,"This book is intended for a particular audience, and I think it meets the needs of that audience rather well. Frankly, if you do not have a working knowledge of basic land navigation prior to buying this book, and before buying a GPS for that matter, much of the book will not make much sense. At the same time, if what you are looking for is a detailed account of the technical side of GPS operations and use, this book won't provide what you want. What is covered well in this book is combining the use of GPS with a map for safe and accurate navigation."
4,Concise Introductory Level GPS Book,"It is a good, introductory level GPS book for general users. It sets the record straight of the GPS technology limitations at present, but also describes what it can really do. Free from the usual geemicks you often read in GPS brochures. Not enough material on high precision GPS though."
2,Disappointed,"I got as much from my owner's manual as I did from this book. It might have been a better value if I bought it before I bought the GPS. It is also a little outdated, but I expected that with the technology changing so rapidly.If you want to completely understand all the techy stuff behind what makes GPS work than it just might be for you, but the owners manual that comes with your GPS will be plenty for most."
1,not as advertised,"There are 3 things that caused me to return the product: Despite the description, the sockets are not from 3/16"" to 1/2"" by 1/32"". The 9/32"" socket and 13/32"" socket are not part of the set. Second, despite showing ball detent power bits in the illustration, none of the extensions/adapters/wrenches actually engage the detent (usable but very wiggly). And most disappointingly, the ratchet mechanism for the screwdriver has only 6 positions thus can only be engaged after 60 degree rotations (just about useless when compared to going averages of 15 degree increments). The included wrench is somewhat better in that it has 20 positions (18 degree steps)."
3,"Smith and Wesson SW1014 Ratchet Screwdriver Bit and Socket Set, 61-Piece","This is a very well made ratcheting screwdriver bit set. The only reason that it doesn't rate higher is due to the fact that it was recieverd in a damaged condition, the clear plastic cover was cracked. Although the damage wasn't bad enough vor me tosend the item back the fact that it was sent out that way was a big disappointment."
4,Fits easy into stock location with the correct muffler,"If you check out walker's website, it notes that this only fits their replacementMuffler (54251), at least for the 2001 Saturn SL1 I was using it for. It slid into the stock hanger bushing perfectly. My only wish is that the clamp bolt was made to be closer to the top of the muffler. Though being on the bottom makes it easier to install, it hangs down a bit and I worry about it catching on something where it is at."
1,NOT what it promised,"I bought this for my 2002 Saturn SL and it does not fit. It's made for a much smaller muffler, the one that people have since been using to replace the original muffler. Only a good while after I bought the part, the seller put up a note that it is ""required with muffler, will not fit on OE muffler."" Well, this note would have been helpful when I bought the part, which turned out to be a waste of money and time."
3,no no no,do not buy this dvd if its your 1st tna dvd buy ajs dvd or the best of x dvd this dvd is ok at best but it is one of tna worst dvds
2,Not a good deal,"This DVD is poor, and below the expectations of any wrestling fan mainly for Jeff's fans, the matches never end somebody always screwed him during his appereances. And the first disc is the worst of it.Buy it under your own risk."
4,Jeff Hardy is great,"I must say that Jeff is a great athlete. I think he will be able to become NWA champion very soon if he gets some personal problems fixed up. And his match with Raven at Lockdown is match of the year by far, so buy this dvd![...]"
2,Only received ONE disc....,"I only recently gotten into wrestling again. For Christmas I recieved Jeff Hardy: My Life, My Rules and had watched all of that DVD in one day. On January 4th, when Jeff ""returned"" to TNA I immediately the next day bought this DVD. When it arrived in the mailbox a couple of days later I couldn't wait to open it and when I did I got a surprise...ONE disc! I am extremely disappointed since this was billed as a two disc set. Staying on the DVD shelf, but I am disappointed it was not what I payed for."
5,Eningma-The Best of Jeff Hardy,"While I agree with a couple of the reviews that say TNA may have rushed this 2 disc DVD collection considering that Jeff had only been in TNA for a short time,I personally feel that it doesn't matter.I personally love this DVD collection -rushed or not...because I'm a HUGE fan of The Charismatic Enigma Jeff Hardy,& will be 4ever. This DVD collection WAS worth every penny that I paid 4 it because I'm not only a HUGE fan...I love Jeff Hardy!!!!!"
5,Good DVD,Jeff Hardy is a cool daredevil wrestler. I really enjoyed this DVD. It starts with his first match with AJ Styles which was a great match but I didn't like the ending. The crowd loves Hardy. It includes the cool ladder match he had with Jeff Jarrett and the amazing match he had with Abyss at Destination X. Overall I think this was a very good DVD. Get it if you are a Jeff Hary fan.
5,"Larry Kane , Veteran TV News Anchor / Author","""From the heart and soul of John Iannuzzi, comes a contemporary parenting resource that will make all working parents think over and over again about unique and creative ways to complete their number-one job - raising a child - in the midst of their time-deprived schedules.""-Larry Kane,Veteran TV News Anchor / Author"
5,Angelic singing,"This is some of the very finest ensemble singing I have ever heard, on a par with great early music ensembles such as the Brussels Pro Musica, New York Pro Musica, Deller Consort, etc. and in some ways even superior. The nine women form a perfect, unified choir, flawlessly communicating Eastern Europe's wonderful traditional music, from Russia, Ukraine, Croatia, Bulgaria, and in an entirely authentic manner. They have obviously mastered the special singing techniques of these traditions. I am moved to tears every time I play it, and for some days now I have been listening to nothing else."
5,"""A great gift for friends and family.""",I've given this book to friends as a part of their birthday gift. They love it too. I'm constantly finding wonderful gems and read other parts over and over again. A delightful book and highly recommended. I keep thinking of people I want to give it too. Will buy 3 more.
4,Wonderful Party Themes,"This book is filled with an array of creative parties, there are 11 party themes ranging from simple to more elaborate. The book is also filled with many recipes, crafts, and decoration ideas; most of which are accompanied by beautiful photographs :)"
1,Disappointed,I ordered this book thinking it would be informative for good party ideas for allseasons. I was disappointed in the book's ideas and info. Am so glad I did notpay much for the book because I will not feel bad when I donate it to a thrift shop.
4,buenas fiestas,el libro esta muy bueno para quien quiere realizar fiestas con diferentes motivos de cocinas regionales de diferentes paises
3,"Great recipes, difficult layout","I love lots of the recipes in this book. However, it is frequently hard to find them again under the somewhat vague chapter titles such as, ""Fiber Makes Your Day,"" ""Blending East and West,"" ""Mineral Rich Recipes."" If you have a favorite recipe, it's sometimes difficult to find it again. You have to remind yourself whether or not it's a good enzyme food or perhaps a macrobiotic something that caught your eye. Forget trying to find it in the index. I've highlighted the recipes that I really like so that I can find them again without resorting to flipping through all the pages again. Also, there isn't a whole lot that's specifically indicated as being beneficial for pregnancy--though I am sure lots of the recipes are great. Overall, it's a great cookbook--the layout and organization just leaves a bit to be desired."
5,Consciousness Calibrating by Yourself,Excellent method of using your fingers to test the truth of a statement. Also good info on how to use this tool. Great companion book to practitioners of Dr. David Hawkins work.
3,Its a nice book to read ... but ...,"I did enjoy this book, it was nice to have the lady of a Montgomery was not skin & bones. I only gave this book 3 stars because the ending just did not do it for me, it felt so rushed and just did not have what I needed*** SPOILER ALERT ***I mean *poof* her sister and dad are in love and *poof* Jace and Nellie are together forever and happy.This book is a nice book to read and it is very different with Bernie as a sort of fairy godmother but it wasnt the best book of Mrs deveraux that I've read."
3,Wishes,good read but a bit predicable! I could figure out everything before it happened . it still a quick and ok read .
5,This book was just what I needed to get my spirits up!,"This book is perfect for all women becuase it shows that a woman does not have to have the perfect body to find a good man. As an overweight woman this book helped to bring up my self esteem. It is what is inside that counts, not what is outside. Big woman are just as beautiful as skinny women and this book shows that by the fact that handsom Jace Montgomery chose shy, sweet, and overweight Nellie over Nellie's skinny sister Terel. Terel is also the type of character that you love to hate because she is so self-centered. This is truely and excellent book and I suggest that all women should read this because as a woman you know what it feels like to inadequate."
3,Not one of Deveraux's best,"The plot of this story was very weak. A kind of Cinderella story, it seemed well planned out but fell way short of its potential. I hate how Deveraux has to justify the hero's attraction to a woman who isn't a size 6. If you're going to use one, use one, but don't give excuses!! The ending made me do a double take...how can her sister try to ruin her life, and then end up perfectly happy? She doesn't have to be miserable, but justice demands that she get a little dose of reality! It's a good, fluffy lightweight story to read when you're bored. As far as passion, fun, happiness, and real romance goes...it's not on my reread shelf."
1,Trite and insulting,"Well, I can only think that I finished the entire book because I kept expecting it would somehow get better. It didn't. This really isn't a romance novel, it's a caricature of a romance novel. The basic premise could have been interesting, but the characters are so thinly drawn, I found it difficult to form any attachment to any of them until the end of the book when a few details got fleshed out. And as a plus size woman, I was insulted that the plump but pretty heroine was put under a spell that enabled her to eat whatever she wanted and still lose weight. What was the point of that? The hero had already fallen in love with her with the extra pounds. In fact, after she lost weight, he told her he missed the rest of her, so why make her skinny? Just so the other women in the book would be jealous? Don't waste your money buying this book. There are plenty of better romance novels to spend your time with."
3,Not the greatest...,I love Jude Deveraux and I was really disappointed with this book. I enjoyed the story line but the whole fairy godmother thing was alittle weird.
5,One book that will never leave my collection,The first romance that I ever read was Mountian Laurel by Jude and since then I have read almost all of her books. Wishes is a book that I have read at least a dozen times and I love it even more each time I read it. Jude ventures into uncharted waters with a heroine who is less that perfect(physicaly) and shows us that beauty is eye of the beholder.
5,The Best of the Best!,"I have read and re-read this book so often that its falling apart and I still enjoy it everytime!! What sets Jude Deveraux apart form other romance autors is that she can bring the story to life for the reader and that, is the work of a truly gifted person."
5,A wonderful-feel good read!,"I've read this book over and over and each time I love it more!If you want to read a romance novel with a different flare, read this one!Wishes is one of approximately 25 books in the Montgomery and Taggert series"
4,Another wonderful tale in the Montgomery saga.,"Nellie Grayson was her family's slave, so belittled that she turned to food for comfort. Jace Montgomery, finally recovering from his wife's death in childbirth, has come to town to visit cousin Kane Taggert and his wife, Houston. Jace is immediately taken by Nellie, seeing a beautiful woman, not a fat, frumpy old maid. He must fight Nellie's loyalty to her family and their machinations to keep Nellie at their beck and call. Complicating the matter is a deceased woman's gift of three wishes to Nellie in an attempt to win her way into heaven.Although the ""fairy godmother"" seemed out of place in the beginning, her importance to the story soon makes sense. A visit with the Montgomerys and their extended family is always a pleasure, but to have a plus-size heroine who is admired by the hero is wonderful. Having her lose weight seemed silly and wrong."
3,Pretty disappointed with Wishes.,"I have come to expect better from Ms. Deveraux. I am an avid fan who usually loves her books. While I am very interested in the Montgomery saga, I felt this book was lacking in its storyline. Don't get me wrong, I did like the ""ugly duckling"" part. It just felt as if the characters were not in depth enough. And the ""thing"" with Bernie, was a little far fetched. I enjoyed many of her books better than this one. :-("
3,It was cute except for the fairy godmother,It was a cute little story. I really wished that the author hadn't had the guardian angel/fairy godmother(Berni) angle in the story. It felt that it interrupted the story line. I didn't like how totally spineless Nellie was - it was hard to understand how Jace to stay attracted to that. But I did like how he fell in love with her immediately and didn't care about appearances or weight. Also I liked that he was a widower who had still mourned his wife and unborn child and hadn't had any interest in women.
3,storyteller,"JD gave us everything we needed for a good story, a villian, a misunderstood overweight woman, a man who saves the day plus a Fairy Godmother. What else could you want? Except a happy ending. It had that too."
5,JACE MONTGOMERY IS MY DREAM GUY !!!,"I love this one... Jace and Nellie ,a cinderella story,i like it how Jace doesn't look just at appearance he goes deeper,how he pursues this woman that nobody notices,he just saw something about her,that makes his heart flutter... Jace Montgomery is the son of Captain Montgomery and La Reina in MOUNTAIN LAUREL... I love this story,i love it love it love it..."
4,This was one of her best,I loved this book for the sheer fact tat the heroine was not a tiny thing that turned heads whereever she went she turned hearts . Nelie was a wonderful character she was always thinking of other people. I liked the fact that Jace was not one of those men who think size six is size perfect he had something that all the other men I've read about didn't have he wasn't about looks. I liked his name a lot Jocelyn It is better than Jace.
1,Pre-digested Oatmeal,"This is just a dumb book. It's jammed with the stereotypes that you expect in novels written by lesser authors, makes the relationship between the two main characters into nothing but a soap opera, and the characters are all so predictable in their actions and responses that I just finished the book to see if my prediction for the ending came true (it did). There's no depth to the relationships, no magic in the romance aspects, no character development, and the whole angle of the ""fairy godmother"" makes the story read like a cheesy made-for-children morality tale in a church library. Hopefully few people will read this book first to try out Jude Devereaux's writing or her popularity will drop."
3,Work good,Works good if in closed package. Have to remember to replace as needed. You may have to use more than one on some items. I should have ordered more.
3,Seem to work ok,Not excited but my silverware is in a kitchen drawer which isn't air tight. Some mild improvement.but would work better in a closed situation
4,I don't know if it works yet but would have liked an adhesive backing.,"From the other reviews, and knowing that Hagerty is the name in silver care, I will assume that the product works as described. I guess only time will tell as I am using the product in quite a large cabinet. My only gripe is that I would have liked to have an adhesive backing so it would be able to stick to the sides of my cabinet."
5,For my sterling jewelry,"I keep one of these in my jewelry box and my jewelry is tarnish free. I also lined the jewelry box with tarnish free cloth, so not sure how well these would work without the cloth. Anyway I'm happy that I don't have to clean tarnish off my silver jewelry."
3,Silver protection strips,"Haven't used this for very long, but so far, it's doing a great job. Always been extremely satisfied with all Haggerty products. I trust this will be the same."
4,Nothing to compare to,"These are okay and seem to do what they are suppose to. I have nothing similar to compare to , so I cannot accurately rate."
1,Don't seem to work,I put two strips in a container with some silver candlesticks and they don't seem to have helped at all. Oh well. I do not recommend these.
2,Unfortunately disappointed,"I didn't know what to expect going into this, other than there was going to be gore.Well, there was, and it was, to say the least, interesting (I laughed a few times at the sheer audacity of it), but in the end it just left me feeling cheated. Maybe that's not the right word; it left me feeling unfulfilled.I can appreciate the effort put into it, I really can, but the end product just didn't do much for me.I'll admit, there's more artistic merit to it than to something like Entrails of a Virgin or Evil Dead Trap, but that's not saying much.And, really, is violence that loud? I'm sure the sounds of mutilation were amplified to make people feel uneasy, but I simply thought the whole idea was, for lack of a better word, goofy."
5,Like a sequins hammer ...,"T is fabulous! I had no idea the breadth of his vision. He reminds me of a modern-day Clay Aiken.Never one to pull punches, T will pull on your funny bone until it hurts. T's insights on gardening, wine-tasting and antiquing are refreshing and suprising with someone of T's on-screen persona. But that's just it -- in this deliciously dire read, he's telling the world, ""Look, I am human and vulnerable. I hurt too. I feel lonely when it rains. I prefer kittens to pit bulls. And darnit! despite prevailing public opinion, I thought ""Cheers"" actually got better after Shelley Long left.""Bravo T! Thanks for showing us that all former rapping and break dancing gang members are not predisposed to lives of anger and misogyny, but beauty, diet lemon-lime slice and hummingbirds."
5,Amazingly Good (and addictive)!,"Love chocolate marshmallow cookies and gave these a try - now I'm almost (almost) sorry I did because they are so good they are addictive and now I just can't go back to the other brands. The chocolate on these is excellent and has a satisfying crack when you first bite into it, not grainy or waxy like some others, but rich and smooth. The marshmallow itself is wonderfully tender and light. The cookie is small and unobtrusive. These are simply the best!"
1,Nothing like mallowmars,"I bought these cookies because Mallowmars were out of stock everywhere, and I thought these would be similar. Other than the look, they are nothing alike. These Whippet Cookies are horrible. They don't even come close to a Mallowmar. They leave you with with a bad plastic taste in your mouth. Since I can't return them, they will be going in the garbage. I would give them away, but I would never subject another person to such a terrible cookie!"
3,Product good: Delivery poor,"The product was shipped by U.P.S. It was clearly marked ""Chocolate - Store in a cool dry place."" It was, nonetheless, left at my doorstep when I was not home. I do not know how long it had been sitting in the Florida heat before I got home, but the product was melted and all but inedible.It strikes me that I shuld have received a notice of attempt to deliver, and the product should be kept in a ""cool dry place"" until it could be accepted by me."
1,Bury the book,"Too bad this program forces me to put a rating star on this book, I tried to give it a zero but the site requires a higher rating.As with the majority who have rated this book so far -- this book deserves a quick death. Poor craftsmanship and lots of wood putty. The excellent photographs only prove the point. The caption under the photo for tight finger joints should read ""fill gaps with more putty."" The poor orientation of wood grain, the cheap plywood, the missing measurements, it all was sad to see. The photos of the staining and finishing show very sloppy work. Even the upholstery work is a shame. I agree with the earlier review that suggests this book is for 7th-8th grade wood shop. If you have any woodworking skills and take pride in your craftsmanship, don't waste your money on this book like I did."
2,WARNING: Not for vamps!,"As the leader of a growing vampire brood in troubled economic times, I'm always looking for ways to save money. I figured with coffin prices going through the roof, what better than to make my own? The plans are wonderfully detailed and while each one is quite labor intensive, being immortal means I have plenty of time on my hands.Imagine my dismay, then, after a year of work and a grand presentation ceremony where I gifted them to my 10 closest kinsmen and advisers, I wake up the next morning to find all 10 of my clansmen reduced to ash!!! How anyone can design coffins without consideration for the needs of the undead is beyond me!!That said, since, cosmetically, the coffins were beautiful, and since I imagine the plans would work fine for humans, I gave it two instead of one star."
5,Great Grill Cleaner,Not sure if the company really markets it this way but this is the best outdoor gas grill brush I have ever used! One was left at my house by the painters and I tried it on the grill and was amazed. The long stiff bristles and handle (two handed if you need to put extra pressure) work to get the baked on charcoal and goo out. Other brush's bristles are way too short and get gummed up quickly. This is the ticket.
4,Good for learning Spanish,"No a movie for deep thinkers, but is funny enough. But I've been working on using this to learn Spanish and it is good for learning some of the language, the rhythms, etc. with the language. The dialog is distinct and clear."
5,Magical,"The gardens were magical; the earth turning, the wind blowing, the music and bells combined to create an energy field that I could feel."
4,"Not enough Frieza action, but decent overall.","These are not the best episodes of DBZ ever, but they are still fun to watch. I'm glad that Frieza is in this video, otherwise it wouldn't be any fun, well, actually it would. On my ""Tree of Might"" DVD I saw previews and clips from the Saiyan episodes and they looked like they would be pretty good. Since this tape is from Pioneer instead of Funimation, the voices do not sound the same, especially Vegeta's. In the tape, Vegeta is STILL evil, and of course does not have a son yet. If you're surprised at that fact, that let me sort it out for you: this is before Frieza has even met Goku!! There, with that, just let me say, these episodes don't have enough Frieza action, but decent overall."
4,"This was a cool movie, and you should see it","I like it all, and there a lot of action in it, and theirs just so much to talk about you just have to see it."
3,comprehensie textbook,"Does a decent job of covering all the bases. The endless lists can seem arbitrary (6 language arts; 4 teaching practices; 4 systems; 4 factors; 5 stages; etc, etc), but once it gets into actual examples of how this works in the classroom, it's pretty helpful."
5,Great Book,The book is fantastic and full of important information for teaching young and older children alike. I like the presentatin format.
4,OK textbook,"This textbook was an alright overview of teaching Language Arts to various levels of students. A great book for new teachers, or as a reference for older teachers."
4,"Great product, bad description",The product was in great condition. I wish the description of the book was a little more detailed. I did not know I was buying a textbook. But fortunately it works for my current needs.
3,Not what I expected..,"As noted in reviews prior, there are only @ 2 songs in which the characters participate. My daughter likes to hear them rather than Carly. (she is only 2 after all... :>) I think the songs in general are very clever and I do like the music. If you purchase it for the Marching song alone it will probably be worth it to you and your child. I have to ""Sing Ho..."" every morning on the way to work right now. It does get her up and moving !"
5,Truly Essential for the Middle Level Educator,"I am the director of secondary school student teachers at Lindenwood University in St. Charles, Missouri. I teach courses in Middle School Philosophy, Educational Psychology, and Teaching and Classroom Management. I have found this text to be an excellent resource when focusing on the curriculum, management, and developmental needs of the adolescent. I highly recommend it."
3,like a QUEEN,"It was said to that their music seemed to be QUEEN. Then, the figure, too, became the topic of conversation. Like the name, it didn't become big but the music was wonderful."

2,Worked Great Until It Almost Caught Fire,"After reading all the reviews, I can't believe this vacuum hasn't been recalled. I don't know if the company is unaware or simply doesn't care. This vacuum was great for about 2 years and I used it a lot. I didn't have any problems with it losing suction from dirty filters as some people mentioned, but it did short out as many folks have mentioned. I kept noticing a hot smell the last couple of times I used it, and finally started seeing smoke. As other reviewers mentioned, on the bottom of the canister where the canister plugs into the upright handled, the rubber/plastic material around the prongs was completely melted and the metal had turned black.This would have been a great vacuum, but the fact that the company hasn't done anything about this problem and how dangerous it could be would prevent me from every buying another Bissell or recommending them to anyone."
3,Decent for the price,"I bought this on an amazon friday sale, for around 40 bucks I think. It works fine, has some cool features. I won't be terribly surprised if it doesn't last a couple years because its a cheap vacuum. If I wanted a vacuum that would last 5 years I would have invested more money.It is a great vacuum for the time being, and I have no complaints.It gets 4 stars because it does its job, but won't last too long most likely."
4,ALMOST PERFECT EXCEPT FOR THE POWER CORD,"THIS WAS GOING TO BE MY FIRST UPRIGHT VACUUM AND BOY WAS I PLEASED UNTIL I READ THE MANUAL - WHERE IT STATES ""WARNING POWERCORD CONTAINS LEAD THAT IS KNOWNTO CAUSE BIRTH DEFECTS OR MAY HARM THE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM.""IT REALLY BROKE MY HEART TO RETURN THE VACUUM TO THE STORE - I WISH BISSELL DID NOT USE LEAD ON THE POWER CORD. MOREOVER THE CANISTER DID NOT DO WELL TOO IN THE STAIRS. HOWEVER, IF USED AS AN UPRIGHT ITS A CLEANING MACHINE. IT HAS A DURABLE BODY AND WAS CONSTRUCTED VERY WELL. DESIGN WISE IT WAS VERY GOOD TOO - AT LEAST TO MY EYES. I WOULD BUY IT IF NOT ONLY FOR THAT FREAKING POWER CORD WITH TRACES OF LEAD."
1,Big heavy monster,I've had this lift-off bissell for a year and i wish i could return it. I orginally had a hoover for 10 years and thought i would try something different. I was attracted to the lift off part of this vacuum due to the many stairs i have.THis machine is very heavy and clumsy - the tools that come with this cleaner as not great the brush for the stairs broke after 3 months and the crevic tool is marginal.The worst thing about this machine is that you have to constantly clean and wash the filters or it does not suck. I spend more time cleaning the dirt cup than i wish to. If you dont dirt gets suck in the uppper chamber of the vac.DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE. I spent over $230 for it and it was money poorly spent.
1,Don't Bother!!!,"I don't know where to start except that if 0 stars were an option instead of one I wouldn't even have given it that. This vaccuum is tedious, and one reviewer was correct in saying that you have to clean everything (very time consuming pain!) or it won't suck. Now six months later it won't suck despite cleaning. Everything I read in the poor reviews is true of this vaccuum. Don't waste your money on this one."
5,Best Vacuum,This is the best vacuum I've ever purchased. Features that I value include-- easy to remove handheld canister; great for stairs-- long cord-- fairly lightweight-- does both carpets and bare floors very well-- easy height adjustment-- easy to remove cup
4,Great Vacuum,"I just purchased this vacuum yesterday. Put it together this morning by myself with a screwdriver. Very, very easy. Attachments were also easy to place. Plugged it in and BAM. I couldn't believe how much dust, food and my own hair it had picked up. I have 3 small children and you wouldn't even know they lived here. I was using a Eureka True Hepa (7 years old) and I thought it was great until I used this new vacuum. The Eureka will be out in the trash on Wednesday morning for sure. I've read other posts that say it's heavy, but it's really not that heavy unless you're under 60 lbs yourself. The lift-off canister is wonderful. I had no problems taking it up and down the stairs. It moves freely and really does a wonderful job. The only downfall, in my opinion, is that it doesn't cook or clean the toilets. Love the color and design. Very sleek and very powerful!"
4,Pretty good vacuum with a few flaws,"This is my first upright in over 15 years and it is a pretty good one. It cleans very well and it's easy to tell when the dirt container is full. The dirt container is very easy to remove, replace and clean. The hose is very flexible and the lift-off canister makes cleaning stairs soooooo easy. However, the tools seem a bit flimsy and there is no place on the vacuum to store the stair cleaning tool. Also, if you are a former canister user like myself, it is rather annoying to have to deal with the power cord it is not retractable. If you can live with these minor annoyances, this is a good vacuum that cleans very, very well."
1,Dirty Dusty Difficult To Clean Didn't Last Very Long,"I wish I had purchased something else. The vacuum is difficult to clean/maintain. I am not a fan of ""bagless"" technology now. Do not try and empty the dirt chamber in your house or you will get yuck all over the place! Take it outside! The brush has stopped working even though the belt is fine. This is a heavy vacuum and hard to carry up stairs. The lift off canister easily tips over. It's too big and bulky to fit under any furniture. After 1 year I'm back in the market for a new vacuum cleaner."
2,sniel,The vacuum worked great for about 3 months and was never the same again....it finally died completely after 2 years.We vacuum once a week and don't even have any pets! Disappointed!
5,This Vacuum is WONDERFUL!!!,"This Vacuum is so versatile - I just love it. I have never been able to find a vacuum I really liked and that includes the $1500 Rainbow Vacuum cleaner. This is a little heavy, but totally worth it. It works great - my carpets have never looked better. I highly recommend this vacuum cleaner - you won't be sorry."
2,Bissell 3750 Lift-Off Bagless Vacuum with Free Bonus HEPA Filter,Vacuum sucks up the dirt and pet hair really well the first couple of strokes then it will leave a big line of pet hair on the carpet. I have lowered and raised the roller tried it without the roller and nothing seems to make a difference. It's like instead of sweeping up the hair it just drops it back onto the rug. The canister part and the attachments all work fine. I wouldn't buy this item again though in fact I will probably buy another brand of vacuum soon and usually my vacuums last up to 10 years and I can't stand this one after 3 mo.
3,Pretty good but...,"I read the reviews and it sounded like a good compromise. After all, I wanted an upright AND a canister so it seemed that I could have both with the bissell lift-off. I am not near as impressed by it as some other users, it does a good job, period. The detachable canister is convenient but not super easy to use. Also don't forget that the no bag stuff, is VERY messy to empty, dust flying all over, nobody is fighting at home to do it... A good vacuum overall but nothing special. If I had $400 to spend in a vacuum, I would definitely go for a real canister, probably Electrolux. That was I was using in Europe, they are a lot lighter, smaller, easier to use and oh miracle, the power cords rolls up inside when you push a button !!!!"
1,Fire Hazard!!,"I had the same problem as another Bissell owner. I noticed a burning smell and saw smoke while using the vacuum. After investigating, I noticed that one of the prongs had completely burned off the bottom of the canister and the connection on the base had burned as well. I immediately reported it to Bissell and they are sending a ""remanufactured"" replacement. The unit is 2 1/2 years old and out of warranty. While I am happy to get the machine replaced, I think they should have a recall on this model as it is certainly a safety hazard.Not only that, it is very hard to maintain and the filters constantly have to be cleaned. I finally just went out and bought extras, so I can continue to use the unit while I wait 2 days for the washed filters to dry. I would think twice before purchasing this model."
2,Worked great for 5 months...,"The brush motor burned out after only 5 mos. of minimal usage (single guy in a 1 bd. room apt.) Up to that point it worked very well.I'm glad I only paid $125 for this on sale. For a $240 retail vac, you'd think it would last...and be better constructed.My old Hoover upright lasted over 10 yrs. w/ no service ever needed!"
1,poor on pet hair,"well I was disappointed, the pet hair kept getting stuck in the top filter part, so one has to take that out clean it off and continue to vaccuum this makes the jod 2 times longer,,,,,,,,maybe ok for a petless home,"
2,High claims for a hefty price,I bought this vacuum thinking that with all its high-tech functions and bag-less system it would be far easier and more efficient than the cheaper vacuum cleaners I have used in the past. The truth is that after a couple months it has lost suction and I notice little pieces of dust that I have to go over again. The portable center makes it easier to use and when you use the hose with tools it is far more efficient but I did not purchase the upright model so that I would be down on the floor getting the edges of the room with the hose. It is hard to clean and I plan on returning mine for something a little less cumbersome
4,"So far, so good",Not self-propelled so a little on the heavy side. Convenient lift out in the middle makes doing stairs a lot easier. For the price I paid I think it was a great bargain.
5,I love my two in one vacuum.,"For someone who needed a hard wood floor vacuum, this product works great. The turbines can be turned off, which is a unique feature to be found. The detachable canister part makes cleaning high places so easy, and I'll never switch back to a non bagless vacuum again. The only thing I don't like, is that the canister part doesn't hold the attachments, so you have to carry them. Oh, and there are two washable air filters so only the hepa need be replaced every sx months or so, which is sweet. All in all this is an excellent vacuum if your looking for something versitile. Oh, and I found that this vacuum can lay flat wothout picking up the vacuum end, which I have never seen before. Do your self a favor and get this vacuum."
5,squeaky clean with the red rocket,"My last vacuum lasted 10 year, a Hoover, and I wanted to replace it with something that would last as well. I did a bit of homework before purchasing the Bissell Lift Off Vacuum. Initially I didn't want to spend more than $100 or so but after looking around the Bissell Lift Off seemed worth it. I am very pleased with its cleaning capabilities; it was amazing how much it sucked into the canister. Cleaning areas that were hard to reach was easy because of the lift off feature. The whole unit is a bit heavy, but still very manageable. I'm completely satisfied with my purchase."
5,Best vacuum I ever owned!,"I bought a kirby vacuum about 3 years ago for $1,000. & it didn't do the job 1/2 as well as this vacuum. I love the convenient lift off canister. It's so easy to remove & put back. It makes it so much easier to vacuum my car. The clean up is easy, just dump the dirt into the garbage can. The best part is knowing I'll never have to spend any more money on replacement bags. The only suggestion I have is that when you dispose of the contents from the canister you may want to do it outdoors. Some dust & dirt can have a tendency to spill onto the floor. Overall I have to say this is definately the best vacuum I've ever owned!"
1,Poor Product Design,"I've had this vacuum for 4 months and will be looking for a new one soon. We had a tank Elextrolux for 10 years (handed down to us with probably another 10 years of use) and never had a problem with it. With the Elextrolux all you had to do was change the bag, I didn't even know where the filters were. With this Bissell you have to clean the filters constantly, there are 3, and the bagless container is continually making a huge mess. The suction is next to nothing if the filters aren't constantly looked after. Also, when the suction is compromised it frequently clogs in the hose which is hard to clear. I'm all for product innovation and ease of use, but there is nothing innovative about the core function of this vacuum. I would recommend going on eBay and looking for a vintage electrolux - there is nothing more reliable and easy to use."
4,Good vacuum if your willing to put in a little work,"I think the vacuum works great, but it does require a little work after every cleaning. I have only owned it for about a month, so we will see how I feel in a year or so."
3,Beware: Flaw in lift-off design,"I got this unit for my wife about two years ago and the warranty is past. She loves it! But...Bissel lift-off units work extraordinarily well but the electrical connection between the base and lift-off portions is a weak spot. After a year or two the contacts become tarnished and develop resistance which leads to excessive heat build-up at the connector. Eventually, this leads to a melt down of the plug. The unit begins to smoke and the prongs in the connector can get so hot they actually melt off! Furthermore, evidently only half the plug is available as a replacement part while both halves are ruined in this meltdown. This leaves you with the lift-off portion still working fine but the base portion is useless."
1,Don't Bother,"I bought this vacuum exactly 1 yr. and 6 mo. ago.......the motor has gone bad and costs almost as much as the machine to replace. Of course, the warranty is only good for one year!I called Bissell.....Not helpful. This vacuum sucks and not in a good way!"
3,busymom,"I'm generally happy with this vacuum. I've had it 3 months and it has a powerful suck. They're are some drawbacks. The most disappointing feature is the ""claw"" attachment which stopped working after only three uses. It still sucks but the brush doesn't turn anymore despite it being cleaned out. I have a dog that sheds alot so that attachment is very useful to me. Also, the attachment hose is a bit cumbersome to disconnect from the vacuum and it's very short. It doesn't allow much leeway to use the attachment without it falling over (usually it falls on me). In general it gets the job done."
5,Great vacuum!,"I bought this vacuum to replace a similar Bissell upright that I had used almost daily for 7-8 years. This model is even better! I couldn't believe all the pet hair and dirt that it collected in one use, especially since I constantly clean the floors and carpets. This vacuum is powerful without being cumbersome. It is easy to maneuver, adjust settings, and empty. My favorite feature is the Brush On/Off Switch, located at the top of the canister. It makes switching from carpet to hard floor a breeze. Another great feature is the soft rubber guard around the front that cushions any contact with furniture or walls, preventing scratches or damage. I am a Bissell fan!!"
5,Incredible!,"This is a wonderful vacuum. I have never seen anything like it. It sucks up everything. Pet hair, human hair, dirt, bugs, anything in its path. This vacuum has a clear hose and a clear viewing area for the floor brush so you can see were the clog is if you get any. The floor brush can either be turned on or off. This is nice for uncarpeted floors. There are also 7 adjustable floor hights. The attachments stay in there place and don't come off while your vacuuming. I hated that with my old vacuum. This vacuum has nice big wheels on the back for easy handling. Not to mention the lift off canister is wonderful. I would not buy another vacuum; I will stay with this one for life."
1,"absolutely WORTHLESS, don't waste your money!!!","what a horror. this is yet another useless spiral bound book from what in my opinion is a scumbag scam artist. his book is nothing but a continous ad to get you to buy his other yet again worthless stuff. my god, his techniques are terrible, outdated, and he only preys on the hard working class. don't fall for his bull. don't tell me i didn't warn you. his advice is as Cheesey as the spiral binding he uses to bind his books. that should have been my first clue!!!"
2,This Foam Roller is Oval - not Round,"The first roller I received was oval - the diameter measured 5-5/8"" x 6-1/4"". I requested an exchange and the second roller measures the same in diameter. This affects your ability to roll evenly and smoothly and probably inhibits the overall effectiveness of your exercises. I'm hoping it's not doing me any harm.When I called The Therapy Connection both times to complain about the oval shape, they said they have no control over their manufacturer."
3,EVA Foam Roller,"I purchased this roller on Amazon, but Amazon gets it through another company. The first one I received was oblong (instead of round it was more egg shaped) and very hard to roll on. The company picked up the ""bad"" one and sent another...still not completely round, but much more manageable. As for the roller itself, it does a great job of stretching and working out my trigger points. I've used the regular type foam roller at the gym and this roller is much more durable. I can see it lasting for a long time without getting compressed in areas."
2,Not as Pictured,The foam roller in the picture is exactly what I was looking for but not what I received. Unfortunately the shipping back and forth is at my cost and so it was not cost effective to request a return or exchange.
1,NOT as pictured. Still works i guess.,"This is not as the last picture depicts it as. This is still the open celled foam roller. I was looking for the closed cell, and the picture was too small to tell. but the last picture shows it as the closed cell foam so i thought this was a great deal compared to the $52 for the other one (Cando blue EVA)listed on amazon. This is just an expensive version of the cheaper foam rollers....."
3,"Not Terrible, but Where is the SOUL?","Beyonce and Co. revive the Bee Gees tune, and it overall works. But no matter how well these ladies sing it, you can't help but notice the dearth of soul in this single. Where is the Destiny's Child that sang such great songs like ""Say My Name?"" Now, they have neutered the soul in their music, and it becomes evident in this single and much of the ""Survivor"" album. Not a disaster, but I wanted more."
5,Yummy!!,"This has got to the best baklava I've ever eaten. It's not too sweetlike some of the walnut variety and I've never had cashew baklava untilI tasted this. A friend of mine who is armenian-american turned me on tothis site and every holiday season I give these with rave reviews and, of course I have to get onefor myself.The Best!"
5,gets you in the mood...,"i discovered this cd while browsing in a small shop in kapa'a, kauai. we spent the rest of our holiday listening to the gentle beats of salpica and limbe. i am addicted. when we got home, i promptly purchased an s-tone and mambatour albums - we were not disappointed!"
5,Beautifully made,The album is very good and well assembled. I have been listening to Putumayo collections for almost 3-4 years now and I can tell that almost none of them are bad. This disc reaffirms this assumption and lets the listener fall in a spiritual journey towards greatness.
1,Dead Crap Rap,Obviously the review above is a friend of Datz Lukewarm...This album is a huge dissapointment and its no suprise its another failed white rapper trying to steal rather than create... Their are plenty of better rappers who do DARK rap better and most of those rappers are dark skinned as well.The priviliged white rapper has no place promoting wack rhymes and wack beats go back and work for you daddy at his real estate office BACTH!!
5,"A ""Blast""",I really enjoyed learning about this private base where our rockets were developed. The writers made it so clear and easy to read. Neat!
