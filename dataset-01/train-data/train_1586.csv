2,Nice design but poor sound quality,"They fit nicely over the ear, nice color, but there is really not much more to say about everything else, there is a total lack of bass. The PMX 100 are way better than this and a bit cheaper."
3,Powerful bass?,"The box lies. These cans push out nearly no bass at all. If these produced bass to the same standards as the mids and highs they produce, they would be extremely good. I bought these because of their closed design. It's just a shame that they don't produce any bass. Most of the music I listen to has a fair measure of bottom end, so these really aren't up to it. They are, however good in closed, public spaces thanks to the lack of sound leakage. The construction is good, the fit is comfortable and they look decent. Unfortunately, the lack of bass is really disappointing."
3,Not enough bass,"these are good headphones, they sound great but lack bass. i would look into the open air version pmx100."
3,Not bad.,"First off, I don't use these to listen to music. I'm a transcriptionist, so I wear them all day listening to voice files. The sound quality is great and has made my job easier. I also love how light they are. At first, they were very uncomfortable and even hurt a little bit because they squeezed my head. They did loosen up, however, after a couple days and are now very comfortable. The only other thing is that it took me a while to get used to how to position them, since these were the first neckband headphones I've ever used. The neckband does sometimes get on my nerves from rubbing my clothes, but I think this may just be something these type of headphones do. Overall, I'd say they're pretty good, but you might be able to do better for the price."
2,Not quite what I prefer,"These are comfortable for me, I bought them as a little upgrade from what I had though I've come to realize it wasn't really an upgrade at all. The sound quality from the little iPod earbuds sound better to me overall than these headphones.The highs are no doubt more crisp, but I really can't stand listening to only treble. The extreme lack of bass ruins everything for me."
2,Hype not quailty,"Bought to replace older Sony over the head sytle. Since they were well reviewed online, what the heck. The sound quality is fair. Bass is weak. Highs are brassy! They are very light weight, alomost feel cheap. They are used with an iPod and laptop for music listening.Used them for about two weeks, swithced back to the Sony phones.If you are looking at these phones, keep looking........elsewhere."
2,don't buy them,"very tinny sound - no base despite the fact that they highlight powerful base on front of packaging. iGado, much better."
1,An uncomfortable version of PX200,"These headphones have the same drawbacks as the PX200, i.e. difficult seal, weak bass and an overall unimpressive sound. You can read the reviews for PX200 and judge whether you would like to deal with those issues. But, unlike the PX200, ergonomics of these headphones are incredibly poor.The king-kong sized neckband portrudes so far away from any normal person's neck that you simply can't rest your head against anything while wearing them. They are not adjustable, and look as if you've dropped back fully stretched regular headphones.AND, you will find that you can only get a good seal once the earclips are pinching painfully on your ears. So, wearing them comfortably means you'll have to bear with weak sound.Just as a reference, the earbuds that come with iPod sound just as good as these headphones and are also more comfortable. So, I don't recommend the PMX200 at all!"
2,Not a Winning Game of Chess,"I love this musical, but not this version. While the performers are OK, they have the impact of a suburban theatre group, not big-stage performers. It's also a truncated version of the musical, not the whole enchilada.I listened once, may listen again eventually, but will try to find the version I remember. Bummer ..."
5,Psychedelic Pow!!!,"I own the original LP vinyl record, but I wanted the CD as well. When this album was released it was right on time for the atmosphere within the U.S. during Ronald Reagon's administration. Actually, the tune ""President Gas"" is equally relevant today. In terms of the lyric in reference to the ""Banker"". All tunes on the album are enjoyable. ""Run, Run, Run"" is a very hip tune. Richard Butler's cynical voice is perfect for the presentaion of every tune on the CD."
1,M.I.A.,"I never got this CD I ordered with the 2 others....where is it?First time I've had a problem with Amazon....Please send CD,and I'll review it....please Don Prevost"
3,"Basically, a continuation of ""Talk Talk Talk""","(Three and a half stars). The Todd Rundgren produced ""Forever Now"" sounds very similar to the Psychedelic Furs' slightly better prior album, ""Talk Talk Talk,"" with a somewhat more experimental feel. Two of the better known tracks, ""Love My Way"" and ""Forever Now"" are fairly comparable to ""Pretty in Pink;"" ""Run and Run"" sounds like a merger between ""Mr. Jones"" and ""Into You Like a Train;"" and ""Danger"" is from the same mold as ""Dumb Waiters."" These are all good songs, so there's nothing wrong with that.While I'm not crazy about ""President Gas,"" I do appreciate the humor. Likewise, the late era Beatles sounding ""Sleep Comes Down,"" which features a chorus by none other than The Turtles' Flo and Eddie!!! The more obscure gems of ""Forever Now"" though are the last two tracks, ""No Easy Street"" and ""Yes I Do,"" both of which, unfortunately, never got any airplay.If you like ""Forever Now,"" I guarantee you'll like ""Talk Talk Talk"" as well, and visa versa."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this for my hair and skin. The bottle says,...""producing a superior blend to moisturize and soothe dry irritated skin."" This is not accurate so I'm giving this 1 star. I put the gel on my hair which made my hair dry and frizzy. I put the gel on freshly washed hands and it dried my skin as though there is alcohol in the gel. My opinion is based on being a licensed cosmetologist. I would not recommend this to a friend."
3,Not terribly convincing,"Although there is ample proof of Chinese treasure fleets going as far as India, the further out the fleet supposedly went the less convincing the arguments became. For instance, the shards of porcelin he found on the beach in the Persian Gulf? Would they still be there after 500 years? Or is it more likely they're far more recent.In any case, it does make you think."
1,Almost Useless,"The theory proposed by the person have been criticized by many scholars, including those appear in the DVD as inaccurate and without valid ground. Watching it is almost useless. I would suggest you to read a book called ""When China Rules the Sea"". This is an accurate, very interesting and depth analysis of the Ming Dynasty Exploration to the Sea."
2,yet another,"recent scholarship has determined the chinese invented the lightbulb in 1800 bc, the internal combustion engine in 2200 bc, and established a world wide grid of radio communication satellites in 650 ad.all this without any systematic mathematics.hurrah for the chinese. alas, like the records of the above globe trotting oriental sailor, all the information and data concerning said miracles of intellectual invention have disappeared, somewhere either burnt, or submerged in tar. but speculation continues. meanwhile, spaghetti was invented there, without which no italy would have arisen.oh, and crackers, they invented crackers, and bed posts first."
3,Too much emphasis given to pseudo-historian over actual historians,"It's an interesting theory and there's a lot to like about the history of the Chinese fleet in general, but I can't respect Menzies at all. He's obviously got a theory and when archeological and historical evidence disprove anything about his theory, he ignores it or dismisses it. The documentary does include a number of historians who can categorically destroy his theory, but it seems like that makes the documentary slanted in the wrong direction. Why is so much about one man's idea when his arguments are so flawed? History is dotted with people who had pet theories they believed in regardless of how much evidence proved them wrong, so it isn't anything new, but why give one wrong guy the most coverage in a ""documentary?""By the end of the documentary, I thought Menzies looked just stubborn and foolish."
4,"A Real Page ""Turner""","The first Stan Turner mystery from William Manchee is loosely auto-biographical and mesmerizing. It kept my attention from start to finish. The characters are real and can be related to, unlike some where they are totally fake. This books leads us through the choices and adventures of a young Stan Turner and shows us the path he took to being a lawyer in Dallas, Texas. The plot twists and turns, taking the reader along for the ride, holding on and trying to figure out who did what. Excellent read, highly recommended for anyone who loves a good mystery."
1,Undaunted,"Sorry there is not a zero stars selection. The reader of this book has to be dauntless to waste time reading this drivel. My grade school reading ""I see Spot"" was deeper and better written. His style (?) is like: ""My mother asked me to go to the store. I went to the store. I bought a loaf of bread. My mother made sandwiches. I ate one."" Wow is that exciting or what! And the Publishers should get a new proof reader. There was an error on almost every page. I got tired of marking up the book. The real problem is that I also bought the second and third Stan Turner stories (?). I guess I'll just throw them away unless I can find somebody stupid enough to buy them from me. I read about 100 books a year and this is the worst I have ever read. I post this as anonymously only to avoid reprecussions."
4,Life Expectancy,"On the night Jimmy Tock was born, his grandfather, from his deathbed, predicted five horrible days in the life of the brand new infant. Jimmy's father wrote these predictions down on the back of a free pass to the circus, as per the dying man's request. As Jimmy entered the world, the entire macabre lifelong drama with a clown from the circus, unfurls. When only a few minutes old, Jimmy is hidden by a nurse, as an armed clown shoots a nurse and doctor and flees the hospital with his own newborn son. Jimmy lives his life with the list of terrible days, laminated and always in mind, ever watchful, ever waiting.Terrible suspense fills the reader as Jimmy encounters each terrible day. But there is a lot of humor here too. Jimmy Tock's family is so funny, the reader is laughing out loud at the quirkiness! A rich and delectable blend of humor and horror, this story, filled with unforgettable, realistic, and endearing characters, is sure to please even the most discriminating!"
5,Qwirky,"This story really pulled me in from the beginning and that is why I continued and with the twist & turns I committed until the end. This is my second Knoontz. I didn't fair as well with Darkest Day of the Year, which I did not complete. As strange as the story (Life Expectancy) is it has a moral lesson; eventhough, it has an element of fantasy which I think make a good combination for a great read; a little realistic but unrealistic like sweet & sour. But in the end we learn how life truly is unpredictable and unexpected, which makes the title quite appropriate for this tale. Enjoy."
1,I didn't like this book - period.,"This is the first book that I've read by the author, and I don't know if it's the book or the style in which it was written that I didn't care for. Just kind of a dull, page turning experience is what I walked away with, as I saw things coming from a mile away. The charactors wit seemed forced, and story with the murder, clowns, coincidence/chance meetings, the SUV chase...whoa, just a bit much for me to buy into, even for a book. I will give this author another try, but for this book it's thumbs down for me."
4,"Fun, humorous, adventure ride!!","This book will take you on a very funny, witty adventure. Eventhough these events that happy in Jimmy's life are ""terrible"", they feel like adventures. The chemistry and dialogue between him and Lorrie is fun. This book was a fast read,great ""Gotcha"" twists and turns, and at many times funny. I caught my laughing at many pages. It's a great book just like Odd Thomas was. Koontz did well with this one!!"
1,"Cancel my subscription, Mr. K","Well, I'm obviously in the minority here, but I found this to be an absurd and ludicrous farce that was neither entertaining nor humorous, with cartoon characters and stilted dialogue. Koontz piles on sugar-coated ""smarmy-ness"" and ""cutesy-ness"" in quantites that the F.D.A. would consider lethal. You know the plot's in trouble when an author this experienced resorts to cheap ploys to mislead the reader- I'd expect this sort of thing in a 7th-grade creative writing class. Just as I swore off Stephen King after the miserable Dreamcatcher, I've now given up on Mr. Koontz as well. No soup for you, Mr. K. Next!"
1,Stunk!,"Just another book about a homicidal stalker for 400 pages, with a predictable twist at the end. No real mystery, it just got old! Extremely wordy as well.Spoiler: The wacko clown is the lead character's father..big freakin' deal!!!"
1,Blah.,"I picked up this book on recommendation as a light beach read for my trip to Mexico. While light, this is book is absolutely ridiculous and a contrived piece of trash. The ""critic's review"" states that this is a good piece of writing, despite ""a few false cliff-hangers."" What an understatement! The whole book is a false cliff-hanger, with utterly hackneyed humor. Yes, it is creative but the story is 100% predictable at every turn. Strewn amongst its ridiculous mini-plots are gory and violent attempts at detail.If only I'd brought another book with me to read, I wouldn't have bothered to see ""Life Expectancy"" through to its ""ending."" Apologies to Dean, but this book is Trash."
4,Surpassed Expectancy,"Having torn through the Odd Thomas series I decided to try another Koontz offering and I slipped ""Life Expectancy"" off the shelf, settled down in the Barca Lounger, reclined, and started reading. I could not put it down!Jimmy Tock lives each day knowing that another of his five terrible days lies on the horizon. What Jimmy takes away from each terrible day is hope. From the first terrible day, when he met his wife, to the last when the terror ended for everyone. One thing kept Jimmy going -- There is always cake!"
3,Clever premise,"I was intrigued by the premise of this book, and it met my expectations in plot and in characters. Many times I felt so anxious for Jimmy Tock and later, his loved ones, that as much as I was enjoying this novel I wanted it to be over. Nonetheless, I loved his spirit and tenacity. His family, including his parents and his own immediate family of wife and children, were completely charming and utterly delightful, sentence by sentence. It was page-by-page suspense without the horror. Very enjoyable."
4,Better than some of his newer efforts!,"Life Expectancy is about Jimmy Tock, a lummox baker, who has 5 days in his life that holds some significant danger predicted by his grandfather right before his death. The villain is a psychotic clown, and their are a couple other villains which I will not reveal to spoil the readers. There are not that many characters as one reviewer made out to be. (try the stand or strangers which has 2 to 3 times as many characters!) This is a pretty good book, (better than his last few) but If you haven't read Twilight Eyes, Strangers, Fear Nothing, Watchers, False Memory, or Intensity, I would recommend these books over this one, simply because they are little more imaginative and more interesting than his previous 4 books."
1,Gets worse as it goes along,"There are a few interesting plot twists in this story, but for the most part, it is tedious reading about a pastry chef and his family and some evil clowns who are after them. Some of Koontz' writing is humorous, but overall, it is a ridiculous book that gets worse as it goes along. I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,I was disappointed by this one,"Dean Koontz is one of the nicest authors out there. I like his personality more than his books. This is a great premise, but my enjoyment was marred by several small things. Nearly every single time someone asks a question, Koontz words it this way: ""(the question)?"" Jimmy wondered. No one ever asks anything, they 'wonder'. Also, I could care less about what these people eat. I've never read a book where the characters were so obsessed with food. And what was the point of all of Grandma Rowena's stories? They seemed like space filler to me. Overall, I was disappointed."
2,Two Words: Punchinello Beezo,"I couldn't get past the absurdity of the names in this book. The enjoyment of the plot was stymied by Koontz's incessant desire to merge so much fantasy into a tale that could have been simply given a more real feel to it simply by naming the characters something less abnormal. You don't have to name them Bob or Mary Sue, but Konrad and Punchinello Beezo do little to inspire empathy. No one can relate to a Punchinello, no matter how much he might be like your least favorite uncle, cousin or school yard bully. Any resemblance to any character, living or dead, burns to ashes in a plot that falls way short of Koontzian standards to which any long-time reader has grown accustomed.The shock and surprise delivered by the conclusion of this book loses some of the punch it would have otherwise had with characters named with less absurdity."
4,And there it was.....,"And there it was..... at LONG LAST! The post-modern great American novel. I absolutely loved the book! Koonts humor was surprising and the story was as wild and unbelievable as anything I've ever read. I could not put this one down, and it thrilled me from beginning to end. Buy it! Now!"
3,A surprising outlook,"As a fan, I have watched Koontz evolve with the times and develop as an author. If you read one of his earlier works, and then read Life Expectancy, there is a tremendous variance in style.I was shocked to see so many bad reviews for this book. People seem to think that Koontz has made some fatal mistake by letting his writing evolve and grow with the times.If you read between the lines of Life Expectancy, there are five great stories in the book; each one an event in Jimmy Tock's life as predicted by his grandfather. I don't care what everyone else says, I enjoyed it.Koontz tells great stories. His characters are well developed and so is his plot line.You'll enjoy Life Expectancy as long as you don't expect a Koontz book cast from a mold from the 80's.J. P. Landry, author of Hazard 666"
2,long time fan,"First off, I've read almost all of Koontz's books. It pains me to write a negative review on my favorite author in the face of many positive reviews. There are 2 types of Koontz in my opinion, the ""old"" Koontz, and the ""new"" Koontz, which began around Fear Nothing. The new Koontz is appears to be an exhausted attempt to create a story from uninspiring sources. This book is similar to his last book, Odd Thomas, in the sense that it is a first-person narrative centered around events that occur in the future. This particular book is by far the strangest Koontz book ever written. It's basically about clowns and the life of a man who is a baker. Come on Koontz, I want a story, not just a book."
2,Life Expectancy,"Life Expectancy is not like any other Koontz book, but not to say it is good. It lacks the excitement and plot development of his previous writing, all told as a tedious group of flashbacks. Don't even bother with this one."
2,Love Koontz but not this one,"I am writing this review to let other readers who either stopped reading this book or did not like know it that you are not alone. I stopped reading about half-way because the plot and dialogue seemed too contrived and unappealing....I thought it was nuts to be honest and could not focus on it to keep going.I do not want to disparage any reader from reading any Koontz book, because I am a big fan and many reviewers loved this book, but if you didn't I don't think you missed the point...the book just isn't for everyone."
1,As a huge fan-I don't see the appeal in this book,"Dean Koontz is my favorite author, and to date I've read 31 of his books. But this one just didn't do anything for me. I honestly had to force myself, squirming, to finish it. I really bored me, and I just didn't find it particularly funny, either. It's definetely one of my least favorite Koontz books, if not THE worst. Sorry, this just didn't do it for me. I much prefer Intensity, Twilight Eyes, Whispers, Strangers, Hideaway, The Door To December, Watchers, Icebound, The Funhouse, and Lightning."
5,I felt good after reading this book,"I'm a huge Koontz fan but stopped reading his books about 10 years ago (I got married, got busy, and then got pregnant and had to read a lot of Dr Suess, etc) For Christmas last year, I got a trove of newer Koontz books. I've liked some, others raised my blood pressure. I just got done with this book and I think it may be my favorite Kootz book of all time. When I read the first page and saw that it was in first person point of view, I just knew I'd love it. Way to go, Dean! I just want to meet him and shake his hand!"
5,A different sort of Dean Koontz novel but one of my favourites,"There are already so many reviews of this book I will keep mine brief. I read this book many years ago but re read it recently on my newly purchased Kindle, it is one of my favourites. I view it as somewhat of a departure from what I had become used to of the Dean Koontz subject and style but think it is a great read. I liked the combination of action, suspense and humour that runs throughout the book. It is very well written and worthy of a try even if your not a committed Koontz fan or have not read any of his other books."
4,Pretty good,"This was the 1st Dean Koontz I've read, although recommendations for his books have been suggested. While some parts drag on forever (mostly the beginning) the book was pretty cool. The only really bad thing was that he was a baker and the descriptions always made me hungry! Other than that Koontz has made his way permanently to my bookshelves."
5,new Dean Koontz fan,"""Life Expectancy"" is the first book I have read by Dean Koontz.Everything about it is fabulous;the story, his prose and the moral implications."
5,Definitely one of Dean's best,"Life Expectancy is second only the original Odd Thomas as my favorite Dean Koontz novel.You've read the description so no rehashing of the plot needs to be done. I listened this this on audiobook and was blown away that the personalities of the characters. You're dealing with a family of bakers while at the same time a circus family complete with insane clowns.While it definitely sounds over the top (even over the ""big top"") this novel is suprisingly easy to keep up with. The dialogue is hilarious at times, while the plot will keep you reading long after you should've started doing something more productive.If you are a Koontz fan and have not read this book then you must do so immediately. Even if you haven't read any other works by him this one would be a good one to pick up along with the original Odd."
4,book rating,This is a good book. I enjoyed it very muchIt was very funny and a good read. I recommend this book
3,A whimsical book,I enjoyed this book. It kept me guessing and till the endIt wasn't at all what I expected from Koonts but it goes to show his creativity and imagination. I would recommend this book if you enjoy a whimsical storyline
4,Interesting,"Much in the vein of 'Velocity', I felt that this book was a 'light' read. However, this book is a bit better than Velocity and gets a solid 4/5 stars. The plot feels just a bit silly to me, but that touch of creativity and lightness here actually make for a solid and entertaining read. It's interesting to read about a family that led a different lifestyle than most others and how they were so happy and content. A bit cheesy to some of you maybe, but hey, I liked it.And the whole clown thing and the revelations that came later (poor, poor Natalie and you even gotta feel bad for Punchinello) on were also entertaining if a bit fantastic and some of them rather surprising. Mr. Koontz manages a solid and entertaining read that had me interested from beginning to end. Yep."
5,Different kind of book. Try it out!,"I've read a lof of Dean Koontz. This was probably my favorite of his books. It's not a horrow story, but as always, he uses a lot of twisted humor. The premise is actually very ingenious, very original - not at all like a lot of the books that get churned out nowadays. Even if your not a Koontz fan or a fan of horrow stories, you should read this - you'll be pleasantly surprised."
5,Koontz's finest hour!,"I've been a Koontz fan for years. Even so, this book was such a surprise! In all the horror books that Koontz has written, he has obviously been honing his skills as a suspense-thriller author. This book truly kept me awake nights, trying to find out what happens next. I had to force myself to put it down and at least one night, I lost a whole night's sleep because I couldn't leave Jimmy without finding out what happens next. I agree with the reviews that say the family dynamics are all warm and fuzzy, but for me, the real appeal was the hold-your-breath suspense. So many authors get stale after they have written many, many novels. But, in Life Expectancy, Koontz seems to have broken through to a new level of excitement. Here's a virtual standing ovation from an author who, as trite as it sounds, is truly not getting older, but better! Good job!"
3,Snore!,"I checked this book out from the library. I am so grateful that I did not buy it. This was the first novel of his that I read. I usually wait until they become movies. I know his popularity so, I decided to get into his books.Perhaps, I am not used to his style but then again, I do not like it. I love suspenseful and surprising books but ee gads! There was nothing surprising about it. I knew the fused fingers were going to be a major clue in the story.In the beginning Koontz went into Jimmy Tock's character description ad nauseum. I kept trying not to fall asleep while reading it. I wanted to find out the book was one that I could not put down. I kept reading waiting for the pace to pick up but it did not. The ending was only slightly better than the rest of the book. However, I had to endure the agony of reading this book to get there.This is just my opinion. I know that the other interviewers do not agree with me but as I said, it is just my opinion!"
1,"Horrible, don't buy it","This is the first Koontz book I have ever read, and it may be the last. I agree with a previous reviewer who found the narration overbearing; it was simply too much. I'm under the impression Koontz believed much of Jimmy's narration was clever and original, but to me it was just annoying and saturated with far too much emotion. Let's face, Jimmy's a huge fairy. The book would have been much more satisfying if Beezo managed to kill Jimmy. Oh, and here's another thing: Grandma Rowena is a lip-smacking bag, so keep that in mind.It really is stunning that this block of paper averaged four stars. Yuck. Just a pile of yuck with a double side of yuck. If garbage was fire, this book would be fire. I've been using my copy as a starter for our wood stove.In conclusion, I give this book one star because Jimmy gets shot in the leg. If it had been the head, two stars."
2,never mind................,"I have read every single Koontz book, but geez........this was beyond bad. Yes an easy read, and I know I can't write, but didn't pull me in. Not scary, because it is just too ""out there"". These new Koontz books have really let me down."
2,convoluted relationships,"This book is worth reading primarily for seeing that Koontz has a wonderful sense of humor--the Grandma in the family will have you in stitches! But the extremely tangled, convoluted relationships among the very large cast will make you wish you had constructed a genealogical chart as you went along. Preposterous!"
5,page turner,I have most of Dean Koontz's books and this is one of my favorites. Watchers(which I read a long time ago was always my favorite but now this one sits up there with it). I couldnt put the book down.
3,Fair Balance,"I found this book to be a fair balance of humor and horror. I caught my self chuckling more than once while reading it at Starbucks. In some places it was a touch sappy, but what the heck, sappy is okay sometimes. I'd recommend it to someone who doesn't want to get into anything too deep."
2,One of his worst.,"I can't believe how many 5-star reviews this one got. These people must not read much. I've read many of his books. This one was very bad. The worst part about it was the inane, inappropriate banter between the characters. They would be in these life-threatening, suspenseful situations and all of the sudden make an extremely lame joke and then fall into a cutesy back-and-forth. Imagine if you were reading The Shining and the mother and son are running away from the axe-wielding father, and the mother turns to the son and says, ""Either Daddy wants to kill us or he really needs some help chopping firewood."" I'm not exaggerating. It was literally this bad. It's because of this that you not only don't care for the characters, they often annoy you.And the ""5 terrible days"", weren't all that terrible. And the twist and the end was so far-fetched and loaded, your eyes will practically roll out of your head.Do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this."
3,Hilarious,"This is the first Koontz book I've read that I've found myself laughing out loud. The book is very funny and, in fact, that is one of the themes of the book: that a sense of humor is important when dealing with life... and so many people don't have any humor. Koontz didn't develop any complex plotlines, the book is simple and the characters are engaging. It's a quick and enjoyable read."
1,Trying Too Hard,"I love Dean Koontz, but feel like he needed to fulfill a contract with a publisher so churned this one out from leftover Odd parts. The plot is so promising, but the leading character is too flippant about the circumstances he finds himself in. I don't care how much a family loves to laugh, if you're being forced to aid and abet a homicidal killer you wouldn't be able to make wisecracks, and think about how much you want to marry some stranger you just met. I feel as though he wanted to create a lead character similar to Odd Thomas, but where Odd has compassion and thoughtfulness behind his character, this one is just plain shallow. This is typical of Dean Koontz in my opinion - he'll write some awesome thrillers interspersed with drivel. Take my advice and skip this one!"
1,Couldn't slog through it,"I have to admit I only got about 1/3 of the way through the audio recording before I gave up. Perhaps I would have enjoyed the book better (although I'm not positive about that), but I thought the voice actor doing the reading was horribly miscast (he sounded like he was the grandfather of the main character, not the main character). The pacing was slow, the plot was utterly predictable (at least as far as I read), and the self-indulgent forced ""humor"" of the main character really grated on my nerves and made me wish he really would get shot by the clown and get it over with. This is the first Koontz book I've read - I might give him one more shot, but that'll be it if I don't like the next one either."
3,Life Expectancy,"This book was just like all of his newer books: written with so much detail that it never feels like you get through the story in a timely manner. My favorite book of all time is Lightning, but if you read that compared to his newer books it's a very different style. Maybe if he cut back on all the adjectives, his newer books would be better than his older books. I couldn't even finish this book in the time that I had it checked out at the library because it dragged so much! If you like great stories, read his earlier ones. If you like mediocre stories, read his newer ones."
4,Life Expectancy,"Pretty good, the only distressing thing is the book made me hungry all the time because the main character talks about food all the time."
3,Life Expectancy,"Jimmy Tock's granfather predicted five terrible dates in Jimmy's life and this book is the story, with Jimmy as narrator, of those days.While many of his books are set within a rather short time frame, this one spans over several years, like ""Lightning"" (it was years since I read it, but I remember it as a better book than this). Hence, the story is not as tight and leaves much room for Jimmy to reflect upon life, and the result is less suspense and more moralizing than usual. At times it also tries too hard to be cosy and sweet. ""Life Expectancy"" is not one of Koontz' better books."
3,First Koontz book I've read - average at best,"Pros: Easy read; Imaginative plot; Vivid characters; Suspenseful;Cons: Painfully slow at times of suspense... he really drags situations out; Relies on character weakness to further story (flashback to horror movies where I would yell ""Just kill him and this story will end... why don't you kill him?!? argh!"") I prefer when circumstances beyond the character's control cause the story to unfold... not poor/weak character decisions; Finally, the author actually refers to himself as a good storyteller within the story (under the guise of a fictional autobiography). I thought this was unecessary bragging the detracted from an otherwise good story."
2,"Overdone ""witty reparte""","I am a long time fan of Dean Koontz, but I have been very disappointed with both Odd Thomas (which critics seemed to like), and this latest first person narrative. I think Koontz has gone overboard with the sarcastic/funny dialoge between almost all the characters. I know this is fantasy, but the superficial joking style gets old fast. When Jimmy and Lorrie, who have never met, are chained together in the library with a homicidal maniac, they rarely exchange any serious dialoge. Come on! I hope Mr. Koontz will try again - in his previous style which worked so well."
4,Humour and Character,This was not as riveting a book as Dean Koonz has ever written but it was still hard to put down. His character development leads to an attachment that makes you genuinely concerned about what will happen next. My biggest enjoyment from this book came from the humour. I found myself laughing out loud a number of times during the book.The book read very quickly. I enjoyed the plot device he used several times to add to the suspense where he jumped ahead in time and then explain the intervening resolution as either an aside or a flash back.
1,80 pgs into it & still not interested :(,"I am very easy to please, but I am 80 pages into this and I am still not interested. This is my first Koontz book and it will be my last. My coworker recommended this book to me and let me borrow the book. I am glad I didn't spend a dime on this. I've read books that have got me hooked on the 1st page, but this one is booorriinnggg."
4,a page turner,As is with all Mr.koontz books..they are hard to put down.. he always come up with these new novel ideas..i enjoyed it thoroughly.
3,Life Expectancy by Dean Koontz,"I just love this author. This book, however, isn't one of his best. It's still a really good read, but its a little ""wordy."" Sometimes I just wanted to hurry him along a bit. And the book isn't as suspenseful as he sometimes can make his stories. There are enough twist and turns, however, to keep a Koontz fan happy. And, as usual, the last few chapters will hold your interest until the very last page. Anyone else, I might have given this book a 4; but comparatively, Mr. Koontz, in my opinion, has done better."
4,Good Read,"After just finishing this book, I was impressed with its twists and turns and overall, how good of a story it was. I am used to most of Dean Koontz's books being of the horror genre. I actually haven't read any of his books for awhile. Not because I no longer like his books, but because I have been reading a wider variety more recently, than Koontz, King and Straub. When I came back to Koontz and read this book, I was glad I did. I think it would make for a good movie."
4,Koontz amazes us again,"Dean Koontz never ceases to amaze his fans with his wealth of imagination. He can come up with some plots that make you ask, ""where did he get that idea?"" This story is no exception.Just before Jimmy Tock is born, his grandfather gives a prediction of 5 terrible events in Jimmy's future. With the foretelling of the last event, he dies. I won't waste your time with teasers, this book doesn't need any. The characters are funny, scary, heartwarming, and frightening. You will laugh, shake your head and at times yell at the characters in the book to not be fooled by what they see in front of them. It is like sitting in a car on the tracks and riding through a fun house. There is enough action, humor, suspense and at times, pure silliness to go around.Will the foretold events come to pass? Will Jimmy and his family survive them? Pick up a copy, crack open the cover and let's find out"
4,A different kind of Dean,"This novel reminded me of a Gilmore Girls episode with the witty banter. Not in a bad way. I enjoyed the humor and the defatiguable spirit of the protagonists. It was refreshing. I had just reread ""The Bad Place"" which is one of my favorites of Koontz, and I was really surprised at how different his writing style is. I find I am enjoying his latest books - especially ""Odd Thomas"". With that being said, I am going to pretend that he didn't write ""The Taking."""
4,Very entertaining with strange twists.....,"Koontz offers readers a view into the world of the unpredictable. While he starts off with the ""five bad days"" that were announced on a relative's death bed, we see how these five bad days progress and become intertwined. While some of it seems surreal, in fact I believe it is supposed to be. It takes a while to let go of that, and appreciate the brilliant humor that he writes in. There is a nook of humor in every sentence. This was a laugh out loud book even when the story was gruesome. While I was glad to see the ""five horrible days"" go by, I was sad to have this book end. Many other writers are just boring compared to Koonz."
4,"A twisting, winding rollercoaster of suspense by a master!","Jimmy Tock was born on a dark and stormy night. Not so strange, really--except for the fact that his grandfather predicted his birth, his weight, his length, his unusual medical condition--and five horrible days that would lay ahead. Then there was the homicidal clown.Jimmy was raised to expect horror, but nothing could ever have prepared him for the twists his life would take. The night of his birth is bad enough...but Jimmy has five more days of terror and revelation awaiting him...Dean Koontz has guts that few authors nowadays have. He blends humor, love, hope, and faith into suspense/horror/thrillers and creates masterpieces. ""Life Expectancy"" is no exception. While arguably not Koontz's best, it's certainly better than a lot of other books out there. It's touching, its suspenseful, it's purely enjoyable. Everything a great novel should be."
4,Life expectancy lives up to expectations,"Like most of the books I've read by Dean Koontz I really didn't want to put this one down.I love the fast pace of the book,the humor and the way it keeps you on the edge of your seat."
5,Unexpected surprise,"I have to admit that I am not a keen follower of Koontz's Library. Actually, this was just the second novel of him, I've read.The first experience ( ""your heart belongs to me"" ) was a total disappointment. But this one is really different.The story is very interesting and the characters are alive. Between the lines of it, you can reach not only the creativity but also the wisdom of the writer that makes reading a wonderful experience.I'f you like baking pastry, you may find some surprises in it. I believe it deserves five ""shining"" stars."
4,"A good one. Short, and suspensefull without all the gore.","If you like a fast read, this one's for you. After a bizarre deathbed prediction of ""five terrible days"" for newborn Jimmy Tock, the story jumps immediately to Jimmy at twenty and the first of the ominous days. Life Expectancy shows only the advent and drama of each of the days, but there's nothing sketchy about the oddball characters who seem to thrive on the unique pacing of this story. Without foregoing suspense, Koontz has written a pretty good non-gory novel.While his other recent books have (sometimes infectively) explored philosophical angles or theological themes, this one's simply a good story. Typically his villains are unrealistic, but these are far from Koontz worst in that area."
2,...and the Koontz continues...,"Well I have been a great admirer of Koontzs' books even from the beginning like : ""The Funhouse"" where I was scared to go to a circus for quite a while...but it seems as though Koontz focused, yet another, story involving a circus, clowns, trapeze, and so on...so I was expecting to see something different, thinking that the title was a bit misleading....But in the strangeness of it all I found this novel to be quite disturbing given the fact that it involved incest and clowns , which are two subjects that i find revolting.Overall, my opinion is that this is not his best!"
1,Ridiculous,I have never in my life read a book that tried so hard to be clever....and wasn't. Quite a disappointment.
1,Horrible,"I LOVE Dean Koontz but this story is horrible. I usually can not put his books down but this one I was forcing myself to read. I was forcing myself to read it because I spent the money on it, but I gave up. The money is not worth trying to bear through it. Right now I am reading Tick Tock and I can't put it down. If you love his classics then DO NOT READ THIS ONE!!I recommend Watchers, Tick Tock, and Phantoms"
1,I can't imagine it being any worse,"I started listening to this book on CD (from the library) because I thought the premise sounded great. However, I can't believe Dean Koontz actually wrote this. It's terrible. The quirky humor was only funny for about 2 minutes and then just seemed cliched. I love most Dean Koontz books and I'm listening to Lightning now (even though I read it years ago). But I would never suggest this book to anyone else. Very disappointed"
4,Very Pretty!,"Love these shoes! I would strongly recommend ordering a 1/2 size larger than you normally order. They do fit a little smaller. I took the advice of previous reviewers and ordered a 7 1/2, i usually order a 7."
5,GREAT SAW .... JUST DO NOT BUY IT FROM AMAZON,"The saw is great. Just do not buy this from AMAZON!!!! I have waited for over six weeks for my saw and finally gave up(I was told in the sixth week of waiting that it wasw being shipped to AMAZON from the manufacture in 3-5 weeks and AMAZON was going to take another 3-5 weeks on top of that to get me my saw for a grand total of 5 moths!) So, I went to southern tools and they shipped the saw that day. I had my saw within three days (not weeks or months like AMAZON!!!)I received the saw in seven boxes but it was very easy to set up! The boxes they used for the saw was reinforced with 2x4's. They even test the saw before it leaves the factory (give you a readout of the test results, which is great to use as a reference.) I got the mobile base and set up the saw in the base. The table saw was square right out of the box. Just follow the directions and you will have a great saw that will last for years!Thank You Southern Tool for my table saw!"
3,Concrete cutter,"Well I've replaced a de walt with slow start feature and bigger blade with this one couse the gears on the de walt failed 'Used it only briefly but its lighter and just as powerful but has no slow start , but its ok for Occasional use ."
3,Book Description,"A behind-the-scenes look at the daily occurrences in a psychiatrists office, where readers can learn insight into how a shrink works."
1,waste of money!!,"I purchased this machine for basic stitching with my daughter. We were so disappointed when we could not even get one simple hemline out of it! The stitches were sometimes pretty, and sometimes they wouldn't catch the bottom thread at all, and sometimes the needle got jammed. We tried it with different tensions, and different materials, but were never completely successful. The entire process was so aggravating that my daughter declared she'd rather sew by hand!! Next time, I will spend more for something that works."
5,A+++++,This album rocks! Matthew Middleton is seriously a genius. I highly recommend this album to all music fans.
3,Snaps together with glue!,Bought this model for my six year old. It's not as well made as some of the other Revell Snap together planes. It goes together ok but doesn't lock in securely... I had to super glue. The stickers are a bit hit and miss as well. I certainly did notice the step down in quality on this model for some reason??Having said that it's inexpensive and was fun to build.
1,JUNK,"How this can be called a level one snap together model is beyond me. I bought this for my son, he was really excited when he saw it online. Let me explain how this plane is to be assembled. Step (1) follow the directions very closely, step (2) be very disapointed when the pieces don't stay together, step (3)tell yourself it's worth another try, don't give up , keep trying, step (4) try again, step (5)don't let it get the best of you, pretend it's an exploding airplane. So,to sum it up, if you enjoy disappointing your children, getting frustrated, and wasting your time and money, this is the plane for you."
1,don't,"Revell has a good rep and a snap together kit should be easy for a kid, especially with Dad's help, right? Should be, but definitely not this one. Parts don't fit and the exercise just leads to frustration. The tiny CHINA stamp on the tail says it all."
1,Gawd Awful,"Not really sure how to describe how bad this book is. I cannot believe all the positive reviews. Suffice it to say the narrator exists almost only to moon over the other main character, a horrific mess of a girl - most of my homosexual friends would have run from her fairly quickly. Then again, with a narrator so underdeveloped perhaps his sole existence is to tell theAmity Stone story. Anyway, I did very little laughing, groaning mostly. Hope these two aren't based on real people!"
1,Pass on this Poorly Written Book,"I must say that I was truly disappointed by this book. The only thought that kept going through my head while reading it is that this book should be read solely to give the reader a reference for a poorly written book. So many cliches, so little time. The descriptions of the characters and situations are worthy of a junior high literature class. Very little effort is made to develop any character fully. If you want a funny gay novel there are FAR better works available.I planned on selling this book on Amazon Marketplace (I don't even want to waste shelf space on this book) but I don't think I could in good concience collect cash from someonefor this book."
2,You've got to be kidding me!,"This book sets you up and then throws you down. Although we'd all like to have ""ALACRITY"" as a best friend, that's all you'll want when your done with this thing.The characters with the most promise are the ones most underdeveloped. Winston, Grandma, Maid, Step-Dad, (what's his real deal)?You get 2/3 through, the plot line deepens, and 60 pages later you're wondering if the reason the whole she-bang gets wrapped up in a few paragraphs, is that Andy Schell forgot about his editors submission deadline.I expected more from such a 'Fresh, New Talent', I got much less. ""G'yaw""!"
4,Absolutely Academy Award Awesome,"Incredibly funny, touching, and just down right readable. Thisis definitely a book that made me laugh out loud... recite some linesto friends.. and cry like a baby. (My favorite kind). The only thing that irritated me was Amity was from Texas and the author tried to give you the pronunciation of her dialect. I have lived and traveled all over Texas and he didn't come close. I only wish he would have asked me... I could have given him the right dialect.. :) It was still a great job though. It's FUN to read. END"
4,Finally - a gay romance story...,"...with an unexpected ending! The characters were very knowable. We all have people in our lives like this. Amity is a whirlwind. Harry is a confused boy next door, who just wants to be in love. Nicolo is the object of that want. But MONEY enters the picture and throws the perfect picture upside down. The book is a page-turner. I wanted to know what happened to these characters. The ending actually made me shed a tear. ENJOY!"
3,A fun romp but...,"Quite disappointing. I bought this book solely on the basis of his stellar short story, The Outline of a Torso in the anthology, Summer Share. It's still an interesting read with a well-written protagonist and love interest. But it dwells too much on Harry's relationship with Amity, that I find his interactions with Nicolo wanting. He becomes too drab at times, too straight-laced in others, compared to the zany machinations of would-be gold digger Amity.I was expecting a romance but what I got was more of a story of friendship. Maybe, that was my failing. But it is still a satisfying tale and worthy of your time."
2,Not worth it...,This was a ridiculously contrived book. The characters are caricatures that do not have the depth of a puddle. The plot devices are so staged they are laughable -- which are the only laughs I got from this book.
2,It's a Mess,"I wanted to like this book, I really did. But it was so disappointing in so many ways. From the cardboard characters to the offensive stereotypes to . . . , well there's so much there that doesn't work.Schell is a fine enough storyteller, if not fairly predictable. Within the first 50 pages, it was fairly clear how it was going to end and most of the complications in between. Anyone who has watched an hour of television can predict what is about to happen and how it is all going to wrap itself up.While I sound harsh, I would say the book would make a fine beach read. Its light and pointless, a perfect book to read, pass the time, and then forget."
1,"Really, Really Awful","I am shocked at the number of readers who have given this such high marks. This is really a piece of ****. That plot is paper-thin, the characters are shallow, stereotypical losers, and the book if full of that isn't-writing-a-gay-novel-such-a-lark attitude. I mean, I don't expect everything to be great literature and I enjoy fluff as much as the next person, but the preliferation of this type of novel scares me. By ""this type"" I mean bad imitations of already fluffy fiction. Anyone who has ever watched a bad sitcom and soap opera could write a book just like this. Please notice: I did not say that writing ability was required."
4,Surge Protection,"So far so good. Haven't had any problem, but there has not been any lightning in our area, so don't know how well it works."
3,Does what it's supposed to.,"Nice long cord, lot's of outlets compared to many others. Plugged in stuff, plugged into outlet, and went about my work. Can't ask for more.If it blows up in a year or so, I'll change my mind.Tom C"
5,Great plug layout,"Pros:- plug layout makes for a lot of highly accessible plugs on the same strip- 10 foot cord is nice option.- coaxial surge protectorCons:- noneA great basic power strip. I really like that the outer plugs are widely spaced and face outward to accommodate power bricks without covering up other outlets. The inner, narrow strip of adds many more outlets in a small space for non-power-brick cords."
5,Perfect,If you are going to buy a surge protector; but this one. There's no competition. Amazing product.
2,Phone Line Problems,"I bought two of these, one for my TV system and one for the computer. I could not get the phone line circuit on either one to work I had to get a Radio Shack plug in to get the job done on the P/C"
2,Is Barely More Useful than a Standard Power Strip,"I purchased this power strip for use with a variety of plugs, many of which use the large brick style plugs. For Example: [IMG][...]This surge protector looks like it would accommodate the different plugs far easier than a traditional power strip, but the ports are still too closely placed to one another to be of full use. I end up being able to utilize only some of the ports if I arrange my plugs in a variety of manners, but never am I able to make full use of all the ports. I will most likely order this surge protector to better accomodate my needs. http://www.amazon.com/Belkin-BP112230-08-Pivot-Plug-Surge-Protector/dp/B000JE9LD4/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid;=1347824977&sr;=8-3&keywords;=surge+protectorThe device is not faulty, it just won't support large plugs very well. If you plan to use traditional straight plugs only, I'm sure it would be fine, but for the extra 5 dollars I'll be replacing it with the one listed above."
3,Probably a open box item,"I purchased ""Belkin 12-Outlet Home/Office Surge Protector with Phone/Ethernet/Coaxial Protection and Extended Cord"" from Amazon ( Ships from and sold by Amazon.com ). The package arrived in time. However the cable was loosely tied and looking at the surge protector it looked like it was already opened and handled. I paid for a new item, but looks like I got a open box item."
4,Affordable surge protector,"I have two these surge protectors that I've been using for the last year now. No issues so far. I was able to get each for $15. They provide alot of outlets for expansion and each oulet has enough space to not come in the way of the other outlet. The extension cord is nice and long. Also the surge protector plug is slanted so that it doesn't interfer when plugged into the top outlet of an electrical outlet. Can't go wrong for the $15 I paid. I would gladly pay $30 for this set of features. Make sure you register the product to take advantage of the $30,000 insurance. Although after reading the manual it stated that you have to use the coaxial, telephone and Ethernet connections to be eligbile to make an insurance claim. I havent used the those connections at all and never have made an insurance claim with any of the surge protectors I've owned over the years."
1,Triple FAIL,I've had three of these.One lasted two weeks before it quite working.One lasted about 30 hours before it died.One was DOA.Belkin used to have good quality products.How far they have fallen.
5,Love all the outlets,I needed a surge protector that had a lot of room for plugs. This one is great.
5,Plenty Space,"This surge supressor has plenty space to plug in justabout everything. It is thin, so it doesnt take up a lot of space. Overall a well designed product."
2,Ethernet Signal Degradation,"I used this surge protector for about 2 weeks before returning it. The 120V power component of the device seemed to work fine, but it would degraded the Ethernet signal significantly. I would see an 80% drop in download throughput along with lost packets, interestingly upload was not affected. I tried multiple cables and multiple speed-tests to confirm it was the protector causing the problem. I tried cleaning the ports with compressed air, but that didn't solve the problem so I returned it to amazon.If it wasn't for the Ethernet problem i would say its a pretty good surge protector, the plug placement is pretty good. The cord management thing is kinda useless and your better off using a velcro/nylon tie."
1,Broken from the start,"Item shot out as soon as plugged into the wall, and we hadn't even plugged anything into it yet. As soon as we plugged it in,it smelt like something was burning."
5,Won't Work Underwater,"If you drop this in your fish tank, it will stop working and your fish will float motionless at the top of the tank. But if you need a relatively cheap surge protector with many outlets for all your TV and AV stuff, then this is a great item. All it takes is one bad storm and your electronics could be toast without a surge protector. You'll always need more outlets than you think... eventually."
4,Good product but picture 4 shows coax protection,"I have no problem with this product. I am disappointed in the pictures that show coaxial in and out connections in picture #4. The model doesn not have those, and its something i require."
5,Great Product,"got this surge protector for $20. 12 outlets,6 spaced out for boxed or angled plugs, ethernet ,phone and tv cable protection and insurance coverage to boot! super fast shipping too.but be ---warned.-- read review about guy that actually dealt with belkin for coverage after power surge damage.seems like a frustrating hassle if you need to claim"
3,Works great but plastic wire holder broke,This Surge Protector works great. The only problem is the wire holder at the ends that holds the cords. It broke after plugging in the third wire. I decided to live with the problem since it works but I would have liked it to have remained intact.
3,build quality not that great,I bought this surge protector at my local electronics store and while it does its job the build quality isn't that great. The top surface has scuff marks and the black pieces that cover each outlet have the tendency to pop out when unpluging an item.
1,"Did not work, need to return. Received current shock","I've heard that Belkin is the best, however my product must be a defect. Once I plugged it in, I luckily avoided an electric shock. Power went out. Management tried also, same results. Need to return it."
3,Center strip of plugs can be better,"Overall its good but I wish there was more spacing between the center plugs and the side plugs, some times based on the cord I have to sacrifice a plug."
5,great!,"Great product, just as advertised and really fast shipping, i love Amazon and would definitely buy again hereThe price was right for buying online so i'm very happy"
5,Great Surge Protector,The Belkin surge protector provides a well designed array of outlets for normal plugs and adapters for electonic devices. They are arranged so that a maximum of outlets can be used. Great product.
5,Good product for a great price.,"This surge protector is easy to use with plenty of ports for all your electronic devices. I have a 52 inch LCD TV and wanted to protect it and all of my other home theater devices. It's well worth the small price tag, especially considering Belkin's protection reimbursement plan."
5,Belkin Surge Protector,"First, I am not an expert on Surge Protectors but if you have quite a few units to protect this Belkin 12 outlet protector will do the job. All of the makes I looked at provided for the large AC adapters but indoing so they blocked at least one or more outlets,reducing your usable outlets,this one does not. The one I am using, in addition to the outlets provides protection for phone and DSL lines,coaxial cable, RJ45 port and has Lifetime Warranty.J Butler"
4,Peace Of Mind,"With any surge protector no one ever knows how capable it will function until there is a power increase. This unit is miniature in size compared to some with the same 8 power connections and the included cable management clip is beneficial for keeping wires organized. The ""not grounded"" red light is a good accessory that will warn you if the unit is not properly grounded. The ""Protected"" green light provides confidence that the surge protector is operating correctly. The ten foot power cord and the 90 degree plug allows you to install-it into a 4-plug wall outlet effortlessly. At the outset I indicated there is no way to truly rate a surge protector......until it is put to the supreme test. But just knowing it is installed, this surge protector should give everyone a little ""Peace of Mind""."
4,Belkin 12-Outlet Surge Protector convenient,The Belkin 12-Outlet Surge Protector accommodates many plugs with different configuarations. It has a slim profile allowing it to fit into tight areas. Various cord lengths are available depending on needs.
4,Nice product.,"Good location on outlets, allows 6 large packs and 6 regular size plugs. Used for desk in home office and have a few of each type of plug left over.Only complaint is I wish the plug was able to rotate, as the cable to the surge protector comes off the wall outlet at 135 degrees, and I would have preferred 225 degrees as the outlet is to the right of my desk, and not to the left. A minor complaint, but would make the unit a 5 star for sure."
5,does the job,love to know that I can plug several things into this and dont have to worry about blowing a fuse.
5,Excellent Surge Protector,"After setting up my entertainment center and desktop pc on a pair of these I easily made my money back on my next power bill. Granted, any surge protector could serve that function, finding one with enough outlets lead me to these.I was a bit worried about connecting my cable modem through these as I wanted to keep a signal available even with the surge protector switched off, but it actually still transmits signal regardless of its power status."
5,Belkin outlet,I received 12-outlets strip very fast. It's exactly what I expected. For this price it's very good and solid product. I like it. :)))
3,Surge Protector,"A little larger than I had hoped, but not very thick and the flat plug is what I really like."
3,its ok,everything as per the product descirption.its light considering its size.its nice to have so many outlets.But....you would like to consider the socket layout as it might not suite your requirements.....I have more charging adapters for mobiles and tablets then for laptops and they tend to interfere with each other.....center strip is good for laptop plugs only...
5,Best Surge Protector,"When my new HDTV arrived, I realized I had forgotten to order a new surge protector. So I ran to Best Buy and purchased a crappy, overpriced Monster ""home theatre"" surge protector. After paying almost $40 for the stupid thing, I got home only to find that not only could I not fit all of my plugs into the narrow row of outlets, but the surge capacity was much too low for my beloved new big screen. I immediately went to Amazon.com and purchased this Belkin, like I should have done from the beginning. And it's perfect: wide-spaced outlets for wider plugs means you can use *ALL* 12 outlets (even with big, fat A/C adapters plugged in!); a 10' cord so you can run it to where you need it; low-profile, right angle plug means it will fit behind furniture easily, and plenty of joules to feel safe with. It's perfect! I returned the Monster, saved $15, and got a much superior product."
4,"good basic plug, missing always on ports",This is a great power strip for basic needs. Lots of plugs and long cord. Only missing feature is a always on port to use for lights with their own switch or other devices that always should be left on vcr etc. I would like to turn off most devices but leave a few still on. Some other plugs have this feature.
5,Surge protector,"This was very nice to have for our 52"" Samsung, Samsung Blu-Ray, Dish DVR and Bose surround sound. Lots, and lots, and lots of cords to plug into this Belkin and they all fit and it's working perfectly. It is especially comforting to know these items are now surge protected. That's all I need is to blow out over $6000 worth of equpiment. Would definitely recommend this and the price was right."
4,Good build quality. Lots of room for all kinds of adapters.,"Good build quality. Lots of rooms - it can accomodate six large adapters plus six cords. That's good enough to share between two cubicles / workstations in our office.We also use this in our conference rooms. The extra long cords come in very handy. The design is nice enough to put it on top of a conference table, for people to plug in their laptops during meetings.I also put this in our trade show travel kit. Again, the long cord is useful in a trade show booth, and it provides ample connections for all kinds of devices.The flat angled plug (the one that goes into the wall) is also handy, for situation where the wall outlet is behind furnitures."
4,"Good, worth the price","Lots of room to plug in our items. Great to help organize our plugs. No problems with this thus far, 6 months later."
4,Good Surge Protector - Nice Design,This model worked our well for us. The layout of the outlets is particularly well thought out. The spacing allows for use of oversize plugs without loosing spots.
3,Belkin Powerstrip Backplate is upside down,"This is a very nice full featured power strip with one flaw: The screw holes for mounting this power strip are upside down. There is a hole through which a #6 screw head will fit and a narrower slot above in which the screw shaft will fit so that the power strip can be securely hung on a vertical surface, but the narrower slot if used means hanging the power strip upside down. Somebody was asleep at the switch in the design of this power strip's back plate."
2,Poorly Engineered for wall mount,"The wall mount keyholes are too small to accept screws large and strong enough to secure the plug-laden unit to plaster or drywall. The keyholes are arranged so that the labeling on the product is upside down when the unit is mounted vertically even if the tiny screws can get purchase. ... So the thing ends up in a tangle of wires on the floor. If you can toss the mess under the tv console or behind it, perhaps this could work. But if you're looking for a clean solution, this isn't it."
5,This is very necessary!,"I bought this mainly because I needed more plug space. My small white surge protectors were getting filled up and didn't match the color in my room. This has a long cord, nice color, and has all the outlet space you need. I haven't had a power outlet to comment on that, but overall a great product."
1,Plug may not fit your setup. Take a closer look at the plug,"I have a big powerline network adaptor plugged into the lower outlet. I intended to use this power strip to plug into the upper outlet. It simply won't fit because of the way the plug worked. Most homes have vertical outlets. And if your lower outlet is already occupied by a bigger adapter, this will not fit. What genius designed this? A more common plug would have worked."
5,Belkin 12 Outlet Home/Office Surge Protector with Phone/Ethernet/Coaxial Protection and Extended Cord,Belkin 12 Outlet Home & Office Surge Protector with Phone/Ethernet/Coaxial Protection and Extended Cord - Works well and has been perfect
5,Outlets to spare!,"Needed a new surge protector as my computer peripheral collection keeps growing. Very pleased with the ample spacing of outlets for those awkward ""wall wart"" adapters. Built in cable management is also a plus! Competitive price was also appreciated!"
3,Well placed receptacle plugs,This surge protector is good. I like the spacing of the plugs. It allows to plug in some of the oversized transformers. It would be great if it had a place to store the extra extension cord to minimize the clutter.
3,This thing is BIG and ugly,It works but man... it is HUGE! It only has 8 outlets too... If you don't care about aesthetics or physical dimensions then the product is good.
5,Just what I needed.,My old power surge protector was just too small for all my wires. This product is perfect and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. I love it and the color.
4,good,"great surge protector one of the rare 12 outlet protectors very thin and easy to use, mount and hide."
5,good product,I bought the Belkin 12-outlet surge protector a month ago and it works fairly well. The product is good in quality and the distance between the outlets are wide enough for something like cell phone charger without sacrifice an extra outlet. I strongly recommend it.
3,Damaged with mild fluctuations,After using this product for one day there were mild light fluctuations in the house. No other equipment or surge suppressor in the house was damaged but this surge suppressor stopped working. I have to seriously think about buying Belkin suppressors any more.
5,Lots of plugs...,"I have been using this now for 4 months, and I have found no issues/complaints. I had to buy a new one because my old 5-port surg protector was running out of room for me to plug devices. So, I bought this one for $27. It has lot of plugs to accomodate any gadget-freak like me. It has plugs with wide and regular spacing to allow big adapters and normal-sized plugs. Haven't hooked my phone lines and internet connection thru their connections, so I can't really comment on those. This would be a nice buy for around $25."
5,Belkin 12-Outlet Surge Protector - Works Great!,"The item was shipped and received in a very timely manner as always, Thanks to Amazon.com! Plugged in the unit and electronics and the unit works great! Love the way Belkin built this surge protector to allow you to close off the outlets that are not being used."
3,slows ethernet connection,"the surge protector works great i am sure. however, it drastically slows down your high speed internet connection. one of the main reasons why i bought the product was for the ethernet surge protection. now i just run my ethernet cord straight into the computer."
1,Waste of money,What a piece of junk. I plugged it in then turned it on. I heard a pop then smelled a burnt smell. That was the beginning and the end. It never worked.
4,Plug End Does not Swivel,"This is a good light weight item. The real drawback is that the plug end does not swivel like some of the other Belkin plugs. If you need to get into a tight space where you don't want the plug to go out to the right side, you are out of luck. I had to get another Surge Protector because of this since I couldn't get the plug into the outlet."
3,Works as expected.,What do you say about a surge protector. It works and has a long cord which makes it unusually handy to use.
2,Falling apart,The surge protector looked great and I thought belkin would be of good quality but parts of the surge protector are falling off already which suclks.
4,"great surge strip, but keep an eye on the kid protectors","I've purchased maybe 3 or 4 of these belkin surge protectors at this point. They are really great, but on two of them I've noticed that the kid-proofing sliders sometimes pop out. Not a deal breaker at all, but I wanted to point it out."
5,Belkin 12 Outlet Home/Office Surge Protector with Phone/Ethernet/Coaxial Protection,"This solved the problem of our treadmill causing out TV to freeze and loose the signal. If you have U-Verse and have had this problem, order this Belkin and it should resolve the conflict."
4,Designed with more thought than average,"I've had this for a few weeks. It replaces an older Belkin Isolator only because the Isolator produced a humming noise that I didn't want to deal with any longer, other wise I like the Isolator better.I could've paid more attention to the dimension before buying, but it surprised me with how large it is. (But is does have eight outlets, four of which can fit the big AC/DC adapters.) It is nicely thin, but I would like to see the stuff in the raised and non-outletted third hidden under the outlets instead, which would make it not so thin, but it would reduce it's footprint. There are screw holes on the bottom to wall-mount it if you want.The sliding outlet covers are a little giggly, but that's not a big deal. They are a nice feature to have so you don't need to keep track of traditional outlet covers.I do not use the removable cord organizer/trafficer, which seems only useful if your cables are heading in the same direction."
1,Pure Garbage,I ordered three of these.One was DOA.One had one row of working outlets and the other two rows did not work.One worked fine for three days and totally died.I returned two for a refund and kept one to open to see if it could be fixed.After opening one up it's not wonder they failed.I'll never pay for Belkin again.
1,Lasts a few months and then you're out of luck.,"Worked fine until one day I flicked the switch off to reset some hardware plugged into it and it wouldn't turn back on anymore. I'd be fine with that if this was caused by a surge, but merely toggling on/off should not blow the unit, so that's an instant one-star. If you regularly need to use the power switch, stay away from this model.It lasted a few months, Belkin's website doesn't even recognize this model as existing and their RMA processes is convoluted. When I emailed their support, they told me to mail it to them and *maybe* they'll replace it. They don't cover postage and seeing how that would be half if not the whole cost of the unit, it's just not worth it."
2,Disappointing Outlet,"I can not recommend this outlet for the simple reason that f you have six ""Wall Warts"" installed in the outer two rows of sockets, you cannot use any of the six ""Internal"" central row of sockets. Hence it is only a six outlet unit, not 12. Had Belkin maake it just a bit wider, it would have accommodated six ""Wall Warts"" in adddition to six standard power cords. Some genius saved a few cents in plastic, and by so doing reduced the unit's functionality by 50%."
4,Belkin 12 Outlet Home/Office Surge Protector with Phone/Ethernet/Coaxial Protection and Extended Cord,"I would recommend this surge protector to anyone. When it comes to close strikes with lightening, you will be glad you did. Quite simply - It works!"
3,Lacks clear labeling,Product is well made except there is no network protection (yes I know it is not specified as having it)and the telephone ports and cox ports are not labeld as in/out. This may not make a difference but other surge protectors seem to label them.
5,Very Nice Upgrade.,I have many devices hooked up to this strip. It accomodates everything i need and still have a few plugs to spare. The design and quality is very well made.
5,Belkin Surge Protector,Unit was exactly what I was looking for. Have used Belkin products in the past and am satisfied with their performance.
3,I had problems with trying to use it to protect phone lines,I needed a larger surge protector when I put in a new DSL phone internet service. This device had an adequate number of ports and the various adapters do fit but it is a bit inflexible. I found the plug ports to be a bit close together so I had to skip ports to reduce heat build up. I did have a real problem with running the phone line through the protector then splitting the phone line. It seems to have interfered with the frequencies of the modem. I had to stop using the protector for the phone lines and have the service remotely reset the modem (hours on the phone!).
4,Belkin surge protector,"I bought this power strip because it provides enough (8) outlets and a long (10 ft) power cord. Power strip with long extension cord is not easy to come by in most retail stores, specially at this price."
1,A PIECE OF TRASH ... UNBECOMING OF BELKIN,Received this product and as soon as I started to use it some little parts began to come off. Some plugs did not work ... tried to look inside and it was built in such a way to make impossible to repair it.A REAL PIECE OF JUNK ... threw it away !!!!!!
1,Shipped wrong item...,The wrong items were sent. Never had the chance to return them.. Received two camera bags instead of the two Belkin BE108200-06 8 Outlet Home/Office Surge Protector with Telephone Protection that i ordered...
2,Product is good but disappointed at Amazon,"I just received this product today and i was literally shocked.I've been a loyal customer of amazon for years and this product had scratched, finger prints, and not even rapped inside the box. I even thought if I bought used (which i never do) from amazon, and I was sure I didn't.I was considering whether to return this product but decided to keep it since it works but by the looks of it might not last for a while.If i had received perfect new condition, this product is probably good. Makes me re-consider whether to buy any electronic products from Amazon."
2,Large capacity but also huge size,This surge protector has a very large capacity with twelve outlets but it was way to huge to fit any where I had in mind to use it. I returned it to Amazon.
2,Was not what I ordered,"I had ordered the Belkin Pivot head version of this surge protector but they changed my order to this one with out telling me. But since they seem to have taken down the page for the pivot one, I am stuck with this one."
5,I feel secure.,So far I hadn't had any problems with this.Mainly becuse no extreme weather condition has tested it yet. But It seems to do the job when their is a power surge non of my valuable expensive devices get affected. I recommend this product.
4,Good quality handles a lot of jules,"This is a good buy, and can handle a lot of electronic devices (home theatre) hooked to it. It was very easy to switch everything over and turns on and off easy if you are looking to save energy at night by turning it off.The only reason I gave it four stars is that the chord isn't very long. I don't have many outlets in my TV room, so it stick out a bit in order to reach the wall, so I wish the chord was longer, but it that's not an issue for you, than this will hold up great.It also says it is guaranteed for $100K plus worth of equipment. Nice right?"
4,Serves the purpose,The product is good and options are many.Drawback:But on a little bit expensive when compared to other products
5,So far it's good.,I have had this for a while but finely got it out when putting up Christmas decorations this year. It came in very handy and worked like it is designed to do. Time will tell if that remains my consensus.
5,Excellent Buy!,"This product could certainly be listed as a ""Best Buy"" in any review! It was exactly as advertized and solved my problem of where to plug in the power bricks and all other plugs that are necessary for an entertainment system."
3,Good but not perfect,"I haven't really had much of surge and most surge protectors so far have served good purpose. So my review is purely for usability issue rather than its protection. I got this surge protector mainly to plug in oddly shaped AC adapters (square, large rectangular ones, weird bulky IKEA desklamp power adapters). I figured the ones that are on either side would provide me with the space I needed. Boy, was I wrong. The holes on the side are a little too close to the middle ones. That is, certain power adapters if plugged in one of the side ones, blocks 2 middle ones. I left some power plugs not completely plugged in (non-critical things like desk lamps)."
1,Stay Away,I also had a surge during a storm as others and the same result from this manufacture! nothing but a hard time. I also had an APC product and items that were plugged into that product were damaged also. APC just required me to send the surge protector back to them so they could examine it. APC lived up to there warranty and replaced damaged items while Belkin did not! if i could give Belkin 0 stars i would
2,My computer got fried during Hurricane Sandy,"I had all of my files on this computer....felt safe with this product....after Hurricane Sandy, the computer, mother board and power supply was fried and was plugged into this unit."
1,Junk,"Pros: 12 outlets, laid out in a clever pattern that lets you plug in small wall warts as well as power cords.Cons: Doesn't actually work.I got 4 of these because they have ethernet surge protection, and after a bunch of hardware got fried via ethernet lines during a lightning strike, I decided to spend the money.Well, one of them passes an ethernet signal intermittently, causing connections to drop randomly. Two of the others don't actually pass an ethernet signal at all. Run a direct line between my D-link switch and my eee box, and all is well. Take the same line into the Belkin's ethernet port and run another line between the Belkin and the eee box; no signal. And this is only a 10' run; it's not a struggle for anyone's ethernet hardware. I can only guess it's misdesigned or miswired, and leaks too much current to ground. Given the power available on an ethernet line, that would be a substantial leak.If they got the ethernet wrong, who knows if they got the rest right?Back they go."
1,I won't even give this a one star!,"I bought this after reading the reviews and the looking at the warranty. Well sure enough we got a power surge during Hurricane Irene. Guess what??? Yes the power supply blew on my computer. After a series of phone calls it was determined that since the computer was 3 years old I would get bubkis for the replacement of it AND I had to mail it back to them for them to LOOK at it. Basically it is just a scam and a way to sell more by making the warranty look like the end all. So for the new computer I bought a warrenty through Square Trade. obviously I haven't had to use it but after a introduction phone call from them along with reading all the reviews here, on the BBB website and on you tube the money spent on that 125 for a 3 year spill, drop and damage warranty) promises to be better than this product. So forget this 25.00 item...spend 5 bucks on a cheap surge protector (which always did me good before) and buy a warranty from Square Trade."
2,Not a right angle plug.,"I returned it because the product was not as described.On my particular surge protector, the plug was not a right angle plug (see product description), it was a straight stick out of the wall plug.The box was retail and direct from Amazon. So Belkin needs to have better quality control."
5,Best Surge Protector out there!,This is not just your everyday 5-dollar Wal-Mart surge protector. It comes with coaxial phone AND ethernet protection. I havn't had any surges/blackouts/brown-outs or lightning strikes in my area but this thing is worth its weight in gold. I love the spaced out ports so I can plug in all my transformers for my different computer peripherals. The cable management is awesome also! This the best surge protector out there!
4,Great Surge Protector,"This protector is working as expected, with 2 sets of computer equipment, I think it is handling well. I especially love the spaced transformer outlets, I've got no problem with plugging my transformer plugs in with a row of plugs down the center."
5,love it,"I thought about this purchase for a long while, trying to decide between a variety of the larger models. I've had this one for several weeks and it works fantastically. Under my desk is a bit (lot) messy and I have this thing crammed with loads of wires and large plugs coming out of it. It's actually propped up at an angle and nothing has fallen out yet. Overall, I'm very happy with the purchase."
4,Good product,"I've purchased several of Belkin's surge protectors and am happy with the design. This one's got a nice long cord, plenty of outlets, and a low-profile design that is functional and attractive. The only thing I can think of that would make it better would be a swivel plug, so that when it's plugged in you can swing the plug to the left or right.I couldn't tell you whether or not it's reliable, as I've never known of a power surge/spike that occurred while using one. But I guess not knowing is a good thing in and of itself. I've never lost a piece of equipment on one of these.Bottom line, I'm happy with the purchase."
4,Belkin outlet,"This is a lot safer than the swarm of cords I used to have behind the couch and chairs. It is a good combination, having both the oversize plugs for transformers and the normal sized plugs on one strip allows you to get rid of flimsy extension cords and eye sores. The fact that it also has the right angle plug is also helpful, as it guides the cord to run closer to the wall and more out of the way. Generally, it works as it should, and I have no real criticisms and the price is good."
4,Good Product,"I ordered this product to replace an 8 plug power strip I already had. The first one I got I actually had to return because it didn't work. It just simply would not turn on, but I used Amazon's return service for the first time and was amazed. One business day later I had a replacement in hand that worked great and totally free of charge. I had to send back the other one which Amazon paid for as well. As for the product itself it does the job well. The only thing I would say is that the adater plugs are not quite far enough apart for large plugs that have a sideways orientation, like the comcast modem I have. Other than that it seems to work great."
4,Review,"Great price, Does what I need it to do as of now, still new. Amazon did a great job on delivery and came sooner then delivery date stated. Am now becoming an on-line customer, because of Amazon."
1,wtf,What a big disappointment; I guess I was just unlucky. 50% of the sockets were too small to plug anything in.
4,excellent value,"sturdy even though in plastic housing. Spacing is well placed. Does what it says at a phenomenal price. Would not trust a $5000 plasma to this simple unit, but for a PC or other electronic item protection, no need to buy more."
4,So Far So Good,Replaced a couple of basic power strips with this. Looks better & I feel better about using this instead of the power strips. Hope I never have to find out if this protects better or not. Price was better than what I could find locally. Shipping was timely & product arrived before delivery date. Would order again from this seller.
2,Ethernet protection is rubbish,"The good: design is excellent, plugs are evenly spaced, no problems connecting a lot of computer equipmentThe bad: I specifically bought a couple of these because it includes Ethernet protection. Unfortunately, when I connect my Ethernet cables through this surge protector, the signal is attenuated so badly that up to 70% of packets are dropped. I've tried it with multiple different routers, switches and pieces of computer equipment with more or less the same results. Maybe I got a bad manufacturing batch, but if you are looking to use the Ethernet protection I'd advise getting something else."
2,Caution: Only one phone line is protected,"The RJ11 telephone line protection jacks on this surge protector only have the inner TWO of four connections (line 1 - Red/Green) IF you have two lines in your home requiring all FOUR connections in the RJ11 jack, this unit will NOT work for you . ONLY line one is designed into this surge protector's telephone jacks. Line 2 (the outer two connections in an RJ11 (Black/Yellow in telephone lingo) are not included in the Belkin jacks. They only designed this for a home with one telephone line. If you have two telephone lines and two line phones(Home and Home office for example) you cannot protect line two with this unit. Beware, looks like Belkin was being cheap and only designed with one line instead of two in the RJ11 jacks. Too bad."
4,Working great,It's not complicated. It's a surge protector with good spacing on the outlets. Works great for what I need it for.
4,Get the job done and deals well with obnoxiously big plugs.,This would only be better if the outer plugs were on slightly slanted surface to make the middle row more accessible. Good power strip for a good price.
5,Excellent Item,"There are very few companies around that I trust completely. Logitech is one of the companies, and Belkin is the other. I have had no issues with any product I have purchased from belkin. The quality of the items is outstanding. Take this item for example, my local big box retailer sells it for upwards of $60. Here much reduced. Is it worth 60, yes. I own one and it has worked flawlessly. Provided a high joule rating and unlike Mon$ter brand items, it does not cost a fortune to buy. I have ordered a second to replace a pair of crummy surge protectors."
3,Fingers Crossed,"This is one of those gizmos that you hope never has to fulfill the company's promise---i.e., preventing your PC from being fried by a surge. I noticed that one of the little inserts that sit inside the outlets fell out almost immediately after I installed the device---seems a cheap way to make the outlets. Whereas some folks may like the way the unit routes AC and phone wires, I don't. It would be neater for me if all the wires emerged from the same end of the unit instead of phone wires on one end and AC on the opposite end. It has plenty of room for even the larger power blocks and the outlets are oriented so that the blocks won't get in each other's way, so otherwise the design is fine."
4,Just what i needed,I was looking for a surge protector that had atleast 10 outlets and that were spaced far enough appart that I would be able to utilize each plug. This was exactly what i was looking for. My only knock would be that the wall mounting holes in the back are quite small and did not allow for a standard size screw or nail head. But I was able to figure out a solution easy enough.
4,What I needed!,"Pros: Does its job and does it well. Nice slim design and looks nice unlike previous surge protectors that were bulky and ugly. Outlets are well spaced. Specs say it provides good protection. Price was good when I bought it. Never had an issues after getting it. I had my TV,XBOX hooked to it. It fits under the desk very nicely and has a nice long cord. Very good design."
1,Lifetime Warranty is NOT Lifetime Warranty,"People should know that the ""lifetime warranty"" on Belkin surge protectors is not *your* ""lifetime."" When Belkin discontinues a particular model (usually within 3-4 years of its introduction, if that), the ""lifetime"" ends and the warranty is over. Even a 1 year warranty could prove to be superior to a ""lifetime"" warranty if you happen to buy the product after it has been on the market for a few years and Belkin decides to make a nominal change and discontinue the old model number. Shame on Belkin for using misleading warranties as a marketing tool. We need to expose these shady practices and hope there will be manufacturers with integrity who feel it is good business to say what they mean and do what they say..."
2,Not for Europe,"Be careful all, this product is designed for 110v.I was surprised to find out this info, after the product crossed half the globe within 3 days of ordering. First the whole went out on the house, I tried unplugging all the electronics and tried it alone. Same thing happened.I dunno if it was mentioned somewhere in small lower case font, that this is just to be sold in the US, but iam writing this review so that no one makes my mistake."
1,False Advertising,We bought this product because it states that it has ethernet protection. It does not have this feature.
2,Not what I expected,"Let me explain. It is a surge protector and it works. The reason why I gave 2 stars is because of the packaging, condition of the product, and scratches. The packaging it came in was beat up and torn. Looks like someone rolled over t with a truck, literally there were tred marks. The product looked like it was shoved into this torn box and the cord was not even tied or fastened to keep it together. When I took out the device it has scratches all over it. These scratches were by the plugs. Looks like someone used this and returned it. I thoroughly tested this device to ensure it works and it does. My multimeter reads that everything is on par with the factory specs. Just be cautious. I don't have the time or the patience to return an item I bought as new because it looks like it was used."
3,opened item,"this is the best outlet surge protector I have ever purchased.One issue is that, there is a little crash which mean the item was opened (I assumed)Elses are excellent."
4,RELIABLE PRODUCT,THIS PRODUCT OFFERS BETTER THAN AVERAGE PROTECTION FOR MY DAUGHTER'S COMPUTER AND OTHER ELECTRONIC APPLIANCES.
5,Seems to work,Exactly as pictured except the power cord is longer (a good thing). Only wish it had an universal off/on button.
1,not fit for purpose,"Having used one of these before which is still working, imagine my disappointment when this prroduct's gteen light came on, then the red light followed by an explosion and burning odour. Before I refer you to my solicitor, tell me how a chap in the uk gets a trplacememt from usa!"
1,Mounting holes are upside down!,"After drilling and putting two screw anchors in my wall I found to my disbelief that the holes that slide over the mounting screws are upside down! This would mount the unit with the switch on the bottom and ""BELKIN"" upside down. Just a note in case you want to mount this vertically."
5,Very nice!,Bought this to replace an old surge protector for my entertainment center. Couldnt be happier with this product. Good Job Belkin has always been great for me.
5,VERY HANDY,THIS PROVIDES SEVERAL PLUGS TO ACCOMADATE YOUR NEEDS. IT HAS A BUILT IN CIRCUIT BREAKER FOR PROTECTION. WORKS VERY WELL.
5,surge protector,"This item has worked great. I had it recommended by a friend of mine, and I've had no problems."
4,Would buy it again,"I like this surge protector over others I have had in the past as it lays flat, so it does not have a tendency to turn over.Additionally, the plugs are located sufficiently far enough apart so that it is easier to identify which plug is which.The product is of a very good constructed quality . I don't give 5's but it is very close ."
3,Multi positions need thought...,Very good value but you need to consider how your tranformer plugs will fit this device. Many of mine actually mount side ways which is OK for the end two but are difficult for all the other plugs. Fortunately I could fit all eight plugs as one of the sideways transformers was just short enough to allow for a regular plug to fit.
4,Great product,"Great product - I used this surge for my computer, speakers and chargers for my cellphone.Enough plug in and space between each plugs which is very important.I had other surge protector which there was never enough space between each plug in."
1,Died after a month,"This product initially seemed great in terms of the number and configuration of outlets. However, after a month although the green light was on there was no power going to any devices. The quality is not very good."
4,Does what it's supposed to,"Arrived quickly, does what it's supposed to, my only complaint is that the cord is closer to 7' than 8' and since there are very few outlets in my apartment I was hoping for the full 8 feet. Other than that issue, it works well, has plenty of outlets and the cord holders are handy to keep the cords out of the way."
4,Nice Product,This appears to be a good product. I just recently learned that you must replace these or they can be a fire hazard. I wish someone would make one indicating how many joules have been absorbed or are left.
5,"good protection, good price","I recently purchased a new HDTV and needed something that would give me peace of mind about protecting it from electrical surges. This piece of equipment did it.I have have other surge protectors, which have been a lot more money, which don't provide the quality of protection that this does. It's not perfect, and I'm sure my new television is at some risk, but it does make me feel better and that is worth something."
4,Still working after a year and a few power out's,"I own 4 of these, some of which I've purchased through Amazon. I have one for each TV and electronics and 2 in my home office. We've had a few power outages in our area over the past year and all my electronics are fine and the surge protectors are still running as normal. I have TV's, Xbox's, cable boxes, PC's, chargers, and just about any other electronic device plugged into them. The only thing stopping me from a 5 star review is that there are no USB ports."
5,Great surge protector,I have two of these surge protectors. Both have worked fine wihout any issues. The dust covers for unused outlets is nice.
4,Lots of easy connections,It's big but allows easy connection of multiple power block adapters. I have not used the coax and telephone connections.I like the power plug is angled at 90 degrees so it does not stick out so much from the wall. My power outlet is behind a dresser drawer. I use the holes on the backside of the surge protector to wall mount it.
5,Excellent power strip/surge protector.,"I don't use the phone/Ethernet connections on this strip, just the outlets. But it is very well designed. The outlets are well placed, so even with boxy power cord plugs, most of the outlets are usable at one time. Highly recommended."
5,Great looking Surge Protector,I love surge protectors because the only time you know they're working is when they block the surge and break themselves. Since I haven't had that yet I can only speak on the design.It looks great. Very flat on the ground and the plug layout makes it very easy to use every open slot. It also has a plastic clip area for cable management but I found that under my desk there was no need to use that.The cord for it was more than long enough as well. I could have used one that was half the length but I enjoy having the extra in case I move my desk.
5,SLOW SHIPMENT,"I realize this is not a product review - a bit difficult since the product is NO WHERE in sight. The outlet strip ships direct from Amazon and was (and still is) listed as ""In Stock"" when I ordered on the 31st of last month. For some reason, estimated shipment was not until the 15th of this month, estimated delivery the 23rd. It is now the 18th and USPS still has no tracking info. Pathetic. I'm sure this is a fine item, but it's looking like about a month between order and receipt. In the future I will be ordering items that ship from Amazon only as a last resort."
4,"Nicely made, but need another lightning strike to see if it works.","After my home and office was hit by lightning, frying my phones, modems, I/O ports on printers and computers, hubs, DVD players and other miscellaneous electronics, I decided to buy a bunch of surge protectors.Better late than never, I guess.Since I cannot control Mother Nature and order up a lightning strike on demand, I'll have to wait to see how well my investment in these things pays off.I truly hope it does sometime in the next fifty or so years."
2,"Arrived, I doubt it was new","I got this item, but there was NO packing slip, NO instuction, and NO packaging with the product.. Seems like it was a previous return that was just thrown in the box, which was also not sealed. It seems to work, but this is a bit shady by Amazon to sell this as a cyber deal ."
3,not bad,"I guess nothing is perfect. I was hoping that this product would stop the brown outs to my computer and light whenever the air conditioner comes on, but it does not. At least now I don't worry about damage to my TV when that happens. I am just happy that I did not over pay for this."
1,Warranty is worthless,"I felt the need to review this after having to actually use the warranty. We were using this surge protector for our computer & related equipment. My husband was replacing an outlet so he turned off the circuit breaker. When he turned it back on, the computer wouldn't work. Long story short, the motherboard was fried so we filed a claim with Belkin. After a ton of back-and-forth and jumping through hoops, they have said they will pay us $135. The computer was only 2 years old and cost $1000. The replacement computer cost $1000, and our alternative was to repair the old one for just under $900. This offer from Belkin is laughable. It cost $180 just to have the hard drive salvaged and to get the repair estimate done (which Belkin insisted on in order to file the claim). So the surge protector didn't work and the warranty claim was a waste of time. Maybe another product would have had similar results, but I will be taking my chances on a different brand this time!"
1,Sad Product,"Do not purchase this product. Like so many products these days it is inadequate. The phone surge protector only has single line capabilities. 12 outlets for the system of your dreams, but they fail to mention how inadequate other features are. I have found product descriptions on the Amazon Site to be VERY MISLEADING."
5,Just what I was looking for,This surge protector is very easy to use and store while protecting my internet and computer accessories at the same time. I have had no problems with this item at all.
2,Didn't work.,I bought this and when it arrived I plugged it in and tried to use it. Not all of the plugs worked.
5,Buzzard Bait,This electricial hookup is great. It looked great online and even better in person. The design makes it really easy to use all the outlets.It was used behind an entertainment center to contol and it worked perfectly to handle all the extention cords.If you need to hook up several cords without the mess this it the tool to handle your problem.I will be recommending this to anyone with that type problem.
4,Surge protector+,"This thing is big feels strong design wise and functionality.Has a out of the way on off very good idea, the cord is seriously a heavy duty power cable.I have used Belkin Surges for a long time they always work fine, to be honest the only one I've had fail was an early 90s memorex that just died.Bottom line for $15-30 is worth buying, I have heard bad things about their warranty but to be honest you only want so many high dollar items plugged into each SP anyways :>.I recommend this and own two myself and one older Belkin 2000 c, they do make decent products and this is one of them"
1,"Terrible, Poke your eyes out bad...","This was perhaps the most painful 1 hour and 40 minutes of movie I've ever sat through. The acting is terrible, the production value is almost absent, and the editing could not be choppier. Many of the action sequences are pieced together so poorly that almost no action ensues, or you end up laughing at the amateur quality. It also looks like they went around to a bunch of reenactments and ruined those events by sticking a film crew in the middle of them... I doubt they even bothered to pay any of the ""extras"". The historical authenticity in many of the scenes is lacking or missing completely. Save yourself almost two hours of your life you will never get back and don't watch this garbage."
3,I enjoyed the reading but...,"I read this book in couple of days' time, and I could not stop it till I finished. In that sense, I liked it a lot.However, its main flaw is: how can the author tell the meaning of a myth -or a tale or whatever- for people living thousands of years ago? And why such a meaning is to be a transcendental one? Could it not just be that our ancestors enjoyed (as we do nowadays) listening to a nice story of love, death and/or conflict where beautiful women, heroic and strong men and bad enemies (whether humans or gods) are involved?So I liked the book but I do not think that the author has proved that the meaning of myths is the one he defends. For such a purpose, a couple of more serious works I would recommend to read are: ""When They Severed Earth from Sky: How the Human Mind Shapes Myth"" by Elizabeth Wayland Barber and Paul T. Barber; and ""Ecstasies: Deciphering the witches' Sabbath"", by Carlo Ginzburg."
3,Good book,I needed this book for a class I was taking. It is really easy reading and I was actually surprised as to how interesting it was.
4,As Advertised,"Haven't had the opportunity to fully exercise this program, but from my limited use, it seems it is adaptable to my needs. So far, I'm satisfied."
2,printmaster platinum 16,"The product came with absolutely no instructions for installation , what each CD contains or how to use it. Getting tech help is difficult and it is difficult to use."
4,Lots of options with your favorite instructors,"This is an interval based exercise DVD. Satisfactory instructors lead good, solid workouts. I prefer the ""Metabolism Boost"" for 20 minutes with the pleasant and likable, Jessica Smith. Classic, but effective exercises, but I like watching her and am comfortable with her personality. Jessica uses cardio bursts such as jumping jacks in between weight lifting. One can not miss the count down time clock in the upper corner! For a killer total body workout, I love Michael Carson's ""Fat Burning Cardio"" for 20 minutes. I alternate between a lightweight ball (aka, the playground ball) and a 3 lb. ball. I love those torso twists he incorporates into the workout. I go on my own pace, because he is quite speedy. Either pace, your body will fully work. Happier with this more than the TOTAL BODY TONING, even though my fav, Stephanie Vittorino is not featured."
2,Superficial book,"I found this book very disappointing, I shall not buy anything like this again without looking through it in a bookshop!"
5,Proof of Life,"We live in a world of instant messaging, e-mail and cell phones.A world of anarchy.People communicate so quickly, they send ideas out to the ether fraught with misspellings, poor construction and inappropriate abbreviations (like ""LOL"" for ""laughing out loud."" Or is it ""lots of love""?).Purity of thought must be protected--you may write down the most interesting or important thought in the world, but if you damage your own credibility with a typo, you've undermined your very notion.That's where ""Handbook for Proofreading"" comes in.More than just a manual, Laura Killen Anderson's ""Handbook for Proofreading"" delves into the philosophies of double-checking, advanced techniques for making corrections efficiently, and provides an easy-to-navigate index in case you have a specific proofing emergency.I wouldn't be an up-and-coming reviewer on this site without ""Handbook for Proofreading."" I demand excillence, and this book ensures I achieve it."
1,Great Book for Editing Without a Computer,"If you don't use a computer for editing, you'll find this book very helpful and resourceful."
2,Not Very Fun,"Although this CD doesn't have any real problems, it also doesn't have any real points in its favor either. It has games that teach numbers, animals, etc., but my 7 year old daughter doesn't find them fun enough to play on her own. Maybe she's spoiled by some of the really excellent children's software available, but this CD did not elicit much enthusiasm."
4,Think Diablo II LOD (Plus),"Great, simple, hack and slash in the same vein as Diablo 2 Lord of Destruction. I bought a couple copies for me and my boys and we had a great time finishing the Easy campaign (it makes you play the easy level first. No choice.)in about a week. The kids got bored and now I am playing through the middle difficulty solo.It's great mindless, power up, Level up, gaming. Well worth the [...] I paid for it."
2,Unfinished product.,"Be advised, this game is extremely crash prone and suffers from some extremely frustrating bugs - like character loss! The company admits to issues, and claims to be trying to fix them, but thus far they've done nothing.To top it off, there are big balance issues later in the game that clearly show the game was not fully play tested. Once again the developer claims to be working to address these issues - yet we see no patches to address them.The final nail in the coffin for this game is that it is short, expect only 3 hours to finish the main quest on normal, then you have to repeat the SAME GAME 2 more times to unlock all difficulty levels.What a stinker of a game."
1,Could be great but it is not,"I absolutley adore the Diablo series. When I found out this game was going to be a contender to knock Diablo I & II out of the top of their repsective fields, I immediatley went out and bought it.The graphics look amazing. But they have some serious issues & bugs in this game.After I started having problems, I went to the Tech Support forum and learned that this game should have never been released to the market.Even if by some MIRACLE you get this game installed & begin play be forwarned that over 88% of the people are exp. total charhcter loss after levels 30 and up.Their tech team is either non existant or inept.Save your money. At this point even after the release of their patch (which failed to solve 99% of the reported problems) I dont think the problems will be fixable through patches.Its a shame."
5,best pc game (next to halo of course),man i played this game for only 1 hour and refused to get up even though my friends and i had figured that one out within in the first few minutes.
4,Titan Quest,"Good action game, points to save game could be better sometimes a long way from when you died or left the game. We are still playing it and enjoying ourselves (mostly!)"
2,"Personal opinions, Ms Mathews gives her own without data","Woman preaching about what women want to hear. That's what I get from Ms Mathews. But, sadly there is no concrete words to hang onto that would change any message that a minister would prepare that wasn't mindful of the Holy Spirit. Each chapter sets out to be first critical about any woman that accepts what she refers to as society's perspective of women. (She , herself, makes the name calling of such women who ""accept"" the downward look of this as ""stupid"". For a Christian book , that is not called for.) And, it's not a healthy perspective. She gives no research on any of her opinions. That is the major weakness Ms Mathews makes throughout the book. Pass on this one."
4,Oh &*@! - did he just say that? ;-),"I'm glad I bought this - there are some real gems here. The sound and performances are sometimes a little rough, but there is enough goodness here to satisfy a real fan. The ""acoustic"" numbers are notable, and Ty plays really well on the whole album. And the pick of songs is good - thanks, guys!Beware: Doug is a real potty-mouth here. During some of his mindless pseudo-sermons or mid-song rants, he lets fly with a lot of the classic ""words you can't say on TV."" Does he think this is cool?It isn't.But this is the best King's X album I've bought since Ear Candy."
3,"Nice. NOT THRILLING, but Nice.","I keep this short and simple from a musician and die-hard King's X fan point of view. Very few of these lives songs feature King's X at peak performance (for example the ""Over My Head"" woodstock version) . Like one reviewer said, some of the internet bootleg songs are better. Dougs voice, although still soulful as ever, sounds worn out. I was hoping to get a better sounding recording for a the first live King's X CD. This is basically sounds like a soundboard recording, not very ambient, which is fine for a bootleg. I am mixed on the acoustic set. Some of those songs where not meant to be acoustic. Overall, I am glad this thing is out and I do enjoy it. I guess my expectations were too high. For fans, its a must have. Especially since the last few studio CDs have been average at best. Newcomers, start with the Best of.., Dogman, or Gretchen Goes to Nebraska and work your way up to this."
1,ESPN movie...terrible.,"Saw it on ESPN when it was released. Not worth anyones time. Unless they like to hate Pete, then it would support their hatred."
1,Boring,"Its like watching a bad saturday movie but its cheap so it the cost out ways any recentment that its a bad movie. like to see them do a movie about the big red machine, but not if its as boring as this"
2,Poor biography of Pete Rose's fall,"Tom Sizemore has been in some outstanding performances but I for one do not feel that he resembles Pete Rose. In some ways yes, he evokes the anger and power trip as well as the fan friendly appearance that Rose was known for, but in the end I did not feel that Sizemore should have been cast as Rose, to me it just was not the best fit.The movie portrays a lot of truth but one has to wonder how much is actually embellished. It was interesting to get a behind the scenes look into how a gambling addiction can consume a person and destroy everything and everyone around them. For the most part this is just a made for T.V. movie and although interesting at times, I came away disappointed with it."
1,Have your band-aids ready,I was given this as a gift (after asking for a Stanley) and the locking mechanism simply doesn't. The first thing it did was slice open my finger. It made for a lovely Christmas. I wouldn't buy this if I were you; it's not going to save you money in the long run!
5,Discipline that Works and Teaches,"As a parent, child and family therapist and school counselor I have seen Positive Discipline concepts change the lives of parents and children alike. We are all searching for a way to raise our children that allows them to develop the long-term life skills of confidence, responsibility, contribution and the ability to solve problems. The schools that teach these skills in addition to academics have students that perform better in school and in life. Using Positive Discipline will actually save you time in the classroom, and make your job and relationships with your students much more enjoyable."
5,Great for parenting as well as teaching in the classroom.,"My grown daughter used this book when teaching elementary school. Now she has children she is using the same skill set (learned from the book) with them too. We're so impressed with the way she and her husband are raising our grand children. I wish we had known these methods when we were raising our kids as well as when we were being raised by our parents. In those days the common saying quoted from the Old Testament was probably used too much by parents (i.e. ""spare the rod and spoil the child""). Of course Christ taught in the New Testament to, ""Do unto others as you'd have them do unto you."" This book has good solid principles than can help parents (as well as classroom teachers) be more effective in a positive discipline approach, and in developing respect, cooperation, and responsibility among those they are teaching."
2,did not work,This product did not work for me.I am transgender FTM and I bought it to try and keep my prostetic device in place but it kept moving or not sticking at all. It may have been to heavy but I do know that I followed the direction completely. This may work for some people but it did not for me.
3,"Good, but I did want to toss it across the room a few times...","I totally agree with the reviewer that sums this book up as being ""exasperating but good."" I couldn't put it down, it had me turning the pages - and I confess I do love these over-the-top heroes that aren't quite politically correct - but the misunderstandings did at times threaten to overtake the story. Yet I did enjoy it, and as long as you don't mind some melodramatic eye-rolling moments you probably will, too."
2,Lose weight fast,Prob.. a decent exercise video but I was unable to do some of the moves so I was just standing around during part of dvd..
4,"Fascinating read, fair translation","Wagner's treatise is fascinating. I found his insights into conducting helpful and very substantial, though his anti-semitism does permeate the book. This translation omits several illustrations of the music Wagner uses to exemplify his points. Their absence was a dissapointment.This is a must read for any conductor. Wagner speaks with conviction and from experience. While he can definately ramble on about obsolete topics such as the poor state of viola players, his ideas are mostly very good."
4,variety,This had so many different opinions on how to be a sponsor that it was helpful in that a person go with their own personality style to deal with a sponsee. I was hoping for a more specific point by point proven success routine. This idea only because of the 12 steps being a rather specific guide. I did pass on to others who were struggling with procedure.
1,upon reflection,"The word ""guide"" is somewhat decieving, and unfortunately,this writting is more of a reflection of very few ideas, as opposed to a worthwhile guide. Save your money."
2,Not very good,"The material is fairly thin, the buttons are sewn on using stitching similar to the Tru Spec Basic (which fell off within a week), and I'm not impressed with the quality. For the price, I think the Atlanco Police Gen-1's are much better.Atlanco 1995005 Gen-1 Police BDU Pants, Large-Regular, Polyester/Cotton, Black"
5,Quick and Tasty,"This product delivered what was described. The bread mixed up easily with just water. The texture is dense but tender. The cinnamon was not overpowering but added just the right flavor with the raisins which were also a nice surprise, not overly dry and chewy, but rather moist. The idea of it having whole grains was also a plus."
4,Helpful to all Engineers,I feel it is very useful since it contains a lot of exercise and solution. It can make me easily to understand and save the study time. The other point is that this book give me a very clear concepts in Fluid Mechanics.
1,Disappointment all around,"Not even a small thrill, this was a total waste of time for a sim. Too old too dated... sorry this one is a wash."
2,"Good Info, but very slow and not well delivered","After reading the excellent ""Brother's War"" I expected that ""Planeswalker"" was going to be yet another excellent book. In a way it was, giving out a lot of information that I believe was vital to the entire Urza storyline. Unfortunately Lynn Abbey wrote it so that this information was given to us very slowly, and without much else in between. Also, I didn't like how Urza appeared to be senile, as it seemed to betray his original character. All in all a disappointing sequel to ""The Brother's War"", but a necessary one for the series."
3,I have to give credits to the writer,"The story line was one of the hardest, and I admire the writer who handle it quite well. However, the book is very hard to follow and, because of hte nature of the plot, is quite dark.reader: approach this book with extreme patience."
2,I'm glad the story continued....,"I really enjoyed the first book in this series, and I think that Jeff Grubb is an amazing writer and truly should have been given the whole series to write but gave the new author a chance. She blew it completely within the first ten pages. I enjoyed the plot and characters but the writing itself was absolutely atrocious. It got me lost and confused that I finally gave up trying to understand her style and just focused on the basic progression of the story. Like I said, I'm glad the story continued, but could we get a better author for this one..."
4,Great for Storyline Gurus,"This exciting book is hard to put down (possibly from the anti-gravity unit on the back?) and Lynn Abbey did a great job. This novel tells you just about everything in Urza's Saga (except for Tolaria and Shiv which is told in the next book, Time Streams). If you read Jeff Grubb's ""The Brothers' War"" then you have got to read this. From the Nine Spheres of Phyrexia to the crystalline realm of Serra, this is *the* Magic backstory book using over 3000 years of storyline and Urza even meets a Phyrexian in human skin called Xantcha."
4,"Waste Not, Want Not","This book, while rather disorienting at times, is still a virtual necessity to anyone who truly wants to understand Magic. And for those of you who were wondering what happened to Urza after that lovely earth shattering blow he set off, this is the book to read. And if any of you remember Gix from the last book, He's Back! I won't spoil the end, but this was a great book."
3,Flashback,"This book is really interesting, but uses a too strange vocabulary, and, as it is full of flashbacks, etc it is difficult for me to understand the story properly because I am a no English speaker, I am Spanish and I beg Wizards of the Coast to simplify the vocabulary or, if possible, translate these books into Spanish and other languages."
3,Planeswalker: The battle begins.,"I have to admit that there are good books, and that there are books not worth mentioning. This book falls nearly in between these factors. It was a little fragmented in the facts of the tale, but nevertheless, got me interested enough to finish reading of how Urza, Xantcha, and Ratepe planeswalk between Phyrexia, Dominaria, and Serra's Realm to find a way to defeat the Phyrexians once and for all. Recommended, but don't get lost! ;)Sequel: Boodlines, by J. Robert King"
4,"Great start, But.....","I loved the first book, and I couldn't wait to get this one. All in all it's a good book but it just doesn't live up to the storyline created by the first one. The ending of this book leaves you with to many questions only waiting to be answered by the next. I think they could have done better with this one."
2,Not that good,"I was hoping for a continuation of the Urza Saga, but got a half-baked love story instead. The Urza character here is quite different that Jeff Grubbs original in the Brothers War. I was left at the end wanting something more. The book is really not even needed to understand the other story lines."
2,Not well thought out,"This book held lots of potential. The interaction of Urza with others made for compelling reading. Yet, by jumping back and forth through time, the book has no rhythm. It becomes painful to read. You become easily lost as to what is happening. Skip this book and read Books 1 and 3 of the series, as they are far better."
3,"Useable, But...","It needs a few tweaks to be perfect. I use it, because my miniature dachshund doesn't like to be left behind, but it has a tie closure vice a zippered one, so the dog doesn't stay in unless he wants to. There is a clip to hold his collar, else he'd have fallen out more often than he already has (twice - caught him both times). Better than nothing."
3,good for the price,"It worth the price, it fits well, and no need to break in. It has a big problem in the begining. For the first few weeks, the leather smells bad, like a dead animal or chemical to process the leather. It eventually goes away, but for a few weeks I had a tough time in public. That made me to shop around and get a better boot on sale with the same price from Sears, and I am very happy with it."
2,not good,"i work in the army an for only 2 weeks, this boot fell a part, dont waste your money with this low quality product."
1,Boots,I ordered these boots for general use. Thought they looked pretty good.When I received them it became clear they are poorly made. The sole it not attached to the upper well. The insole is paper thin and poorly made. Very uncomfortable boot.I would spend my money elsewhere.
2,Cheap imitation,I was looking for boots like the ones issued by the Marines. This boot has a heel plate that just about tears apart your foot as you slip it on. No thank you. This is made for someone into pain! The shoelace started falling apart after I laced them up the first time. Sizes run BIG.
3,Smell of rubber wont go away!,"I don't wear these much, but they have polluted my closet with the smell of rubber. The laces have a habit of loosening throughout the day even when a double knot is used to tie them off."
2,Theology changed since 1925 and 1963,"This book became the counter-weight to my Ph. D. dissertation and book,Should the Church Teach Tithing? in 2001. I challenge its fundamental change in Baptist(and Southern Baptist) theology which survived for over 300 years without teaching tithing as a New Testament principle. The 1925 statement did not even include a listing of tithing texts. The 1963 statement includes texts but does not contain the word ""tithe"" in the discussion. The current Position Papaer requires tithng from all who are employed by the SBC --- this is wrong! I have been unable to engage in a discussion with SBC leaders about this change in doctrine. It is a shame that the church's scholars will not discuss this modern taboo doctrine."
3,Quick overview of TQFT and knot invariants,This book is a very quick overview of what was known at the time (1989) about the connection between quantum field theory and knot theory. The subject of topological quantum field theories and their connection with knot invariants was at that time just beginning thanks to the work of Edward Witten on the Jones polynomial.The approach that the author takes in the book is very formal and not for the beginner who is looking to learn about these results. Readers with enough background to read it will no doubt want to read more up-to-date treatments of the subject. The book however does give an indication of how Feynman path integrals are used to define the invariants. The use of these is not rigorous mathematics and this has not changed at the present day.
4,NOT a book about KNOTS!,"If you are seeking a graduate level discussion on quantum theory and knot theory, this is your book. Definitely not for the amateur user..."
4,DiMeola is Di-liscious!,"How can you not purchase for less than ten bucks this stellar fusion recording? I wore out my vinyl copy in college, and the tunes only sound better with age. With the glut of watery synth sounds out, I especially enjoy hearing Jan Hammer boil out some rocking runs--better even than I heard him perform with Jeff Beck! But the star is not Hammer, or even Al, but the whole band. This is a great live BAND album. Tempos shift, intensity varies remarkably, all within the same tunes. Skill does not overshadow art, either--Al and company find humor, joy, intrigue, and beauty in their compositions."
4,"It's PANDEMONIUM, baby!","I just listened to da cd, and as a B2K fan, I can say that their voices have matured and that they are speaking in the tone that young people these days listen to, and they sing about experinces we deal with, such as in the songs ""Tease"" and ""The Other Guy"". ""Everything"" tells about if the guys were to be in a relationship, which I picked as my favorite song on their 2nd album. Plus, Raz-B gets to SING on at least 4 of the tracks. GON' HEAD B2K! It's worth spending ya lunch money ova."
5,GREAT ALBUM!,"I thought R.Kelly did a wonderful job on this album. With the smash hits ""Girlfriend"", ""Bump That"", ""What a Girl Wants"", and ""Bump, Bump, Bump"". But Troy Taylor did a wonderful job helping the boyz with their vocals. The only thing you will get tired of is J-Boog talking through almost every track. Raz-B even shows his sing ablity with ""Everything"" and ""Tease"" and even Fizz's raps are on point. So pick it up, this is one time you can support them."
3,OK,"I THOUGHT THE CD WAS OK, BUT WAS PISSED OFF WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT THE SONGS ON THE RADIO WASNT ON MY CD, SO I BURNED THEIR SO CALLED FINAL CD. I LIKE IT THOUGH. IM COOL THAT B2K BROKE UP BECAUSE THERE REALLY WASNT A B2K, IT WAS A OMARION!!!!!!! AND SOMETIMES LIL FIZZ.!!!!!!!"
2,Alright but.....not so good,"Pandemonium special edition isn't really worth wasting your money on unless you didn't buy the original. The only good thing about this album is the DVD. The cd has the exact same songs on it as the first one with 3 or 4 new tracks. I suggest that you don't buy it unless you want the DVD. You can record the song girlfriend off the radio. Plus the remix of girlfriend on the radio stations is way better than the one on the cd. The one on the cd ain't nothing but the original with a different beat. Basically the only good two things about the special addition is Bump That and the dvd. Pandemonium special editioin is not a bad cd it's just the same as the other one but if you don't own B2k:Pandemonium yet I suggest you buy this one but if you already own it don't waste your money. Save it for the next album. Borrow the dvd from your friend or something. Plus the dvd ain't all that either but, I ain't hating they just trying to make some money."
3,Its Aight,"This CD is filled with a lot of pretty good songs. I don't think it is as good as their first CD, but it is still a good buy for a big B2K fan. I would recommend this album to hardcore B2K fans only."
5,B2K Stepped It Up,"B2K definatly stepped it up this time. This album is tight. They've matured a lot from their first LP. The beats are crazy (Although The Neptunes could prob. sue for plaguerism on a couple cuts..but it's g) I can see B2K moving right into the shoes of New Edition and Boyz II Men. With this album they rise heads and shoulders above their counterpart, Imx. ""My Girl"", ""One Kiss"", and ""What U Get"" are great slow jams, but ""Sleepin'"" shows that these kids aren't kids anymore and they've got the ""Slow Jam Ability"" to become the new Boyz II Men. ""You Can Get It"" is almost too crazy, a club banger for sure. ""Tease"", and ""I Beat You To It"" will find their way into a club near you. The biggest suprise on the album is ""Boys For Life"", a great song that shows that B2K will always hold it down for eachother. Best song on the album for sure. This album will be taking R&B Album of The Year honors easily. Keep it up boys. Peace"
5,Pandemonium,"I remember this album when I was in the 10th grade. I love this album. This album is fierce. The resulting songs reveal a more personal side of B2K. They had a consistent sound with few producers they used on their platinum debut. The title came from their fans. They are always banging on windows or shutting down malls. It was a pandemonium. B2K penned 10 of the 21 tracks on this album and drew inspiration from their devotees. This album has been certified Gold. Remember,this was 2002-2003."
4,b2k the hottest,I think this album Pandemonium is really good. Theres more good tracks than bad tracks. I really like What a girl wants and Why I love you beacause they are both really good to listen to when you want to relax. People who don't like the album don't know what there're missing.It's a shame they've broken up.
2,Ok,"Well, I haven't listened to this CD and I'm not really a fan of B2K. I have no idea why they put ""Why I Love You"" on another CD of their's. The only song I'm interested in is Bump Bump Bump, with P. Diddy. That song is raw. I would of gave this one star, but I know of a good song, so I'm giving this two stars instead. Next CD they should sing with Baby of the Big Tymers (or maybe both of them), Lil' Wayne, Janet Jackson, Mariah Carey, Jennifer Lopez, and P. Diddy should make another song with them. If they do this, then B2K's next CD would be off the {hook} Well, That's my review."
5,the best!!!!!!,"i dont see why y'all dont like the cd im in love with it. mah fave song is what a girl wants, it shows how much they would care for a girl. this is the best cd ive ever herd and to me its great."
3,"Aiight, I guess.....","This re-released package of their third album is aiight. It's not amazing! And it didn't blow up like the first time it was released. The material on this one is still the same, except for three new songs and a remix. Well my favorite tracks are still ""You Can Get It"" ""One Kiss"" ""Would You Be Here?"" ""Tease"" featuring Jhene and Romeo ""Where Did We Go Wrong?"" and ""Boys 4 Life"" And I think that ""Bump That"" and ""Girlfriend"" are two aiight tracks. Oh well, not a bomb but a bullet."
1,lacks variety...,"I'll Keep this as short as i canB2K is all about image (at least 90% image)i have both albums and well, i didn't like it; not my kind of music (maybe i'm too old?)the only tracked i liked was ""Why I love you"" which is on both albums.Most of the tracks are dance rnb; are their more dimensions to B2K or this all they have to offer?"
5,THE NEW HOTNESS!,"i love this cd. im glad to see that the guys have grown up and that they're more mature.i love all the songs but i love ""Boys for life"" the best. when i first listened to it i wanted to cry. But im glad B2K is still going strong and holding it down. Good job guys!"
4,B2K is Still Hot,I just copped the album today and I am really feeling it. The beats are tight and sweet. Everyone has a chance to show their vocal skills and I think that is starting to be a biggy with groups now a days. I say get it and you will not be disappointed.
1,So this is what it's come down to. Pretty sad.,"I hate to use someone else's line, but someone needs to ""bump, bump, bump"" these guys off a cliff.What in blazes is up with the current trend of talentless, watered-down, ""ooohh baby let'th make thome romanth"" R&B junior-high friendly boy bands? Have people actually forgotten what a real love song sounds like? My suggestion to you is this: Download Led Zeppelin's classic ""Stairway To Heaven"". It's not really a love song, but it is a beautiful song that you can easily slow dance to. Go ahead, enjoy all 8:01 of it. Then listen to something off of this dumb disc. Starting to get it? Good. These ""homie g'z"" are the musical equivalent of diet soda with about ten gallons of water added to it.If you consider this some of ""da gr8tezt tooonzkiz"" ever written, than I truly feel for you."
1,Disappointment,"I feel that this cd was a waste of time,energy,talent and most importantly money. I was extremely disappointed at B2K, their debut album was a great cd,but their sophmore album showed me that they did not mature over the time frame at all. Hopefully their 3rd album will not be as horrible as their sophmore album."
4,B2K IS HOT!!,"Okay here is my deal. To me this C.D is HOT but maybe this time they could have been more original? The songs are to much like the songs on their debut album, and like song from other artist, Usher in perticular, but not to say that the songs aren't really good! That being said I think this C.D is HOT, in an o.k sort of way. My review on some of the songs---One Kiss- This song is really cute!!My Girl- Wanna be Neptune beat, very good!!Sleepin'- Sweet and sincereWould You Be Here- Who wrote this? Bad lyrics.Everything- My Fav, very nice!Tease- Very cute!Back It Up- Tight beat, but I don't get...Pretty Young Thing- Good dance trackI beat you to it- I like!! Fizz got down on this track!The Other Guy- Can you say, Last Boyfriend!? But cute.Why I Love You- Don't understand why this is on the album.Boys For Life- Okay song, I mean i mean...Dog by Jhene- Umm why is on the C.D, they givin' her to much premotionWhat U Get- Very un origanal, but hey good song!"
4,Great new CD!,"I bought this CD for a friend of mine for Christmas, and she loved it! I listened to some of the tracks online, and they sound really good. No matter what anyone says, B2K is NOT B2Gay! (he he) The duet with P. Diddy is just simply marvelous... If you want to buy one new CD, buy B2K's Pandemonium!! And, yes, I am sure this CD will cause MUCH Pandemonium! as it hits the charts! It's GREAT!! GO B2K!"
5,sa c'était la releve enfin !,voila un bout de temp qu'on n'avait pas vu des petit nouveau comme a l'ancienne genre new edition et maintenant b5 ou soul for real (que souvenir) bien sure se ne sont pa des textes profond mais les chansson sont pleine de bons sentiment et ensoleillé a (a écouté avant d'aller a la plage dragué) omarion a une voix merveilleuse et lil fizz a un bon flot genre j.dupree les autres font figuration le producteur sait se qu'il fait (immature) bref exellent omarion est peu etre un futur usher comme mh voir aussi o'ryan bonne écoute yep yep !!!
5,even though...,"even though the lead singer omarion can't sing, he got his point across on this album the studio really hooked his voice up this time the best track thogh ""everything"""
5,B2K!!!What more can u ask 4?,"Pandemonium is sooooo hot can't no other artist touch B2K's looks,lyrics,& personalities.I love them sooooo much,yall don't even know.Basicly I'm the definition of loyalty,cuz tell me one person who love B2K more than I do.If you don't have *Pandemonium* I advise u to drop what ever u doin' and run out and get it.Trust me u won't regret it and you'll truly be getting your moneys worth.....Well?what yall waitin'4 stop read and go get it!!NOW!!"
1,I suppose you could do worse...,"If I could give this CD a 0, I would. It's almost a shame there isn't a 0 stars option. Call me a ""player hater"" if you want, but this isn't just some of the worst music i've ever heard it's the most obnoxious. This band is obviously out there for the money and just like your MTV told you to you go out and buy it. It's sickening, this really is an easily impressionable generation. Go listen to some music with substance you morons. I swear you trendy bastards are so much in love with these untalented generic boy bands you don't realize how bad the music really is. And I take that back my original statement, you really can't do worse than this cd; this IS as bad as it gets."
1,MORE CLONES OF THE BACKSTREET BOYS.,"I must say that there is no more originality in music today.Everyone is stealing music off of other artists and taking ideas off of others.B2K is no exception to this fact.After seeing the success of boy goups like the backstreet boys,some greedy label decided to put together another boy group to make themselves some quick money.This album is as corny and cheesy as it gets.All the songs sound the same and they probably dont even write their own lyrics.Most people fail to recognize that artists arent about real passion or skill now adays and only do it for the money.You could skip on this horrible release by a bunch of 15 year old wannabe players.DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH!!!"
2,Really no need for a re-release,"B2K re-released Pandemonium in a special edition about three months after the oringal verisonw as released. Pandemonium Special Edition was included with a crappt bonus DVD a few new tracks. Two of the tracks written by R.Kelly are the strongest on the album which are Girlfriend & What A Girl Wants. While both these tracks are cool there really was no need for a re-lease hence my low rating. Another compliant on the CD is Why I Love You is repeated from B2K's debut release once again,"
2,I CAN'T GET NO SATISFACTION,"I got this album about 2 years ago,and thought that i owed you loyal viewers a personal review. The first album was definetly better. Creatively I think they were in a better place. The standout songs are ""Bump, Bump, Bump"" ""One Kiss"" ""Everything"" ""Tease"". The others were just album fillers, but if you love B2K you should buy this album, Because they are true musicians, despite the disappointment of the final album."
4,Well worth having,"This is a much less extensive commentary than Cassuto's sadly unfinished commentary on Genesis - it covers the whole of Exodus in one volume, whereas he seemed to be aiming at 12 volumes of that size for Genesis. However, it has in miniature most of the good features of his larger work. As expected from this author, he marshals strong arguments against the Documentary Hypothesis but does not adopt a fundamentalist position on Mosaic authorship. While not such a must have as the two completed volumes on Genesis, it is still valuable."
3,An excellent aide in bringing up my daughter tri-lingual!,"My daughter is 3 and she is learning a 3 languages so I need all the help I can get to make sure she learns Spanish. This program has adorable characters and excellent sound and songs and my daughter enjoys it. I love Pepa, the little cute and cool girl that's in the program. One fault is that it does not cover as much as Jump Start Spanish does. The conversation section of this program is better than Jump Start but still not satisfactory. Being that there is so little language software for kids, I appreciate it immensely. It's a nice addition to my daughter's educational software collection that brings with it variety, fun, & learning."
1,Poor CD,"This CD is poor to say the least, cute yeah, but if your child is trying to learn spanish you might as well forget it. The problem lies in the fact that there is no english reinforcement and to make matters worse, the icons are not clear. My son can't even figure out what the pictures are suppose to represent. They'll show you a picture of something and give you the spanish word and you find yourself saying ""Is that a hoof, 2 feet, horse feet, claws, what is that picture?"". And since there is no english equivalent presented you end up confused. ""Pure language"" works in real life but not in the world of computers and monitors. This company needs to go back to the drawing board."
1,Frustrating and confusing!,I have to agree with WaveDave's review! I just bought this directly from TL's website at $29.99 and hate it! No English translations anywhere left my 9 y.o. very frustrated! What is the point of memorizing 6 songs in Spanish if you don't even know what you are singing? Keep shopping! I'm sending it back!
1,BRAZILIANS BEWARE!,"For a 19 dollar mug they charged me 109 dollars, calculating the tax on the basis of the price of the product plus shipping and deducting the tax at source. THat may be the rules they have to comply with but IT'S NOT WORTH BUYING PRODUCTS FROM THIS STORE"
3,Useful but Fragile,"There's nothing necessarily wrong with this product, but I just wish it felt a bit sturdier. It's frustrating how careful I feel I have to be to avoid breaking it. The tea also seems to get cold rather quickly, so I might try a different type of mug next time.On the plus side, I appreciate 1) that it has a lid; 2) that the lid is a good resting spot for the infuser once it's removed; and 3) that it's clear glass so I can see the nice clean color of my tea."
2,Glass too thin,"I loved this mug, but it broke when gently knocked over on a masonite table the first time I used it. So sad. I do love the infuser though and I use it for other mugs. I like that the holes are small enough that I don't end up with a cloud of tiny tea particles at the bottom of my cup."
2,Glass is too thin,"I'll start off by saying that Adagio teas are truly fantastic. But I didn't enjoy this mug. I have a tea kettle in one room and my office desk is in another room, so I carry my teacup from room to room with boiling hot water in it several times a day. This teacup is so thin that the heat is immediately transferred to the handle, and it's far too hot to hold the non-handle part of the mug either. I dropped the lid once and it shattered into tiny pieces. So it doesn't meet my needs - I'll stick with ceramic mugs.However, the infuser itself is fantastic. It's exactly what I need. The holes are small enough that even dust tea doesn't go through. I use it in another mug and it works perfectly. The stainless steel doesn't hold or transmit flavors, so I'm able to use it for white, green, oolong, and black."
3,Much too fragile,"Long story short, my mug lasted one week for shattering into several razor-sharp pieces with only a moderate tap. The glass top has not broken yet but it is only a matter of time. That leaves the infuser which I think is great but not perfect. It does get hot, burn your fingers hot so removing it from the mug takes some care but it does a good job. Buying the mug and infuser set does not make for good value if all you end up with is the infuser. I think the infuser is for sale separately, so if you need one buy it and then go find a better mug elsewhere. It may not fir perfectly but you'll be buying another mug anyway."
2,Glass way too thin,"I have mixed feelings about this mug. First of all, the glass that the cup and lid are made out of is way too thin. It feels flimsy, heat transfers through the cup immediately and cools the drink too quickly and makes the mug difficult to hold, and I'm always worried that I'm going to drop it or the mug is going to shatter from either me dropping it or through rapid temperature changes. On the other hand, the infuser that comes with the cup is fantastic. It fits into many of my other mugs so I can use it with whichever mug I have handy. It is very large so the tea has room to expand while it is brewing. The mesh is thin so I don't end up with many little particles floating around on the bottom of my drink. Finally it is easy to clean and reuse.Overall, I would never suggest the mug, but I would suggest the infuser to anyone who drinks tea."
2,Not for me...,"I didn't care for this because of the strainer. It didn't strain out all the tea, which is why I bought it."
4,Great but a little hot,"I really like the infuser mug. It works very nicely, though I sometimes nearly burn myself when carrying the mug with hot water when I'm not careful. The glass gets hot very quickly, and the handle is small. Similarly, when I remove the infuser from the mug, there is not an easy way to do so without touching the hot metal. If you're interested in this style infuser, which I am convinced produces superior tea to ball or spoon infusers, go for it. You might also consider purchasing just the infuser and using it with your favorite mug instead."
1,Nothing more than a list of courses,and the ones I wanted were discontinued; definately not worth the money
4,"Invaluable spiritually, though quality could be better","There are some practical reasons why I bought the Sunday Missal. For one, the accoustics in my church are very live and all readers, the priest, etc. cannot be understood. Secondly, my church does not provide missals. The best help my church provides is the readings in the back of the hymnal. Without the Sunday Missal, I'm clueless.Spiritually, the Sunday Missal explains the Mass in many ways, including the themes for particular Sundays. It is also nice to be able to prepare for Mass by reading the readings ahead of time.The quality of the book, itself, is lacking. The print is very light, as though the printer was low on ink. Also, many of the pages are stuck together--almost half. If I were conducting quality control for Catholic Book Publishing, I would never have let this particular volume pass inspection."
1,Misleading description of book,"We purchased this book as the Catholic Church had made changes in their liturgy, which made the previous edition Missal's obsolete. This was advertised as the ""New"" Saint Joseph Sunday Missal. Duhhhhh! It is the OLD, OBSOLETE, PREVIOUS edition of the New Saint Joseph Sunday Missal. Even though inexpensive, with the shipping and handling, it was still a TOTAL waste of money. The book store knew they were obsolete, and sold them anyway. We were taken advantage of!"
3,Disappointed,"Very disappointed... A whole section of pages were missing. This was not represented correctly. I knew it was used but I did not expect pages 881 thru 936 to be missing. I needed the missal so I acccepted the loss but I will never order a used copy again, the one i received was obviously never checked to see if any pages were missing."
3,out of date,"The Missal was not new. The Missal was out of date, not usable any more. Cant say it was not partly my fault. I assumed new ment new, as in current. I had to go to a Catholic gift shop to get a "" NEW "" one. live and learn i spose."
3,Not the latest version,"The missal is very attrative and easy to use and read, but does not have the latest changes to the Roman Missal."
4,Overall pleased...,This book is requirement for a class I am taking this semester. The book was stated by Amazon to be in new condition...The interior looks new but the front cover has a lot of blemishes...other than that everything else turned out fine. Shipping was quick (Free super saver shipping) sent off August 8th and it was delivered today 8/11/08.
3,Not worth the price..,Heard that Kona coffee is the best...so wanted to try it....I do not drink it black so really could not taste any difference. Would not bother to buy again in any form...This was not bad coffee just expensive and nothing special.
1,Beware this tape is the same as Zen: The Best of Alan Watts,"This tape is 90% the same material as in the ""Zen: The Best of Alan Watts (1994)"" video. Save your money and buy only one."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY,"I have had 2 of this units go bad in less than a week of work. They work fine for a couple of days but as soon as you add big files to the internal memory ( say 100 MB or more ) the whole system goes bad and is no longer recognized in any computer, nor does the card reader work. The return process with kingston is good but what I really need is a working unit. DO NOT BUY IT"
5,Great for data transfer,"This is the second card reader I've owned from Kingston. I lost the first one that was only a card reader and had no built in memory. This thing is great! I have a Garmin Nuvi GPS which plays MP3s from a SD expansion slot, and both our cameras use SD cards for memory expansion so this is great for transferring images/music to and from the SD cards. Plus the 2GB built in is very handy. I'm a network admin and made this card boot to pendrivelinux so I can boot up and work on a machine that may have problems with Windows. Enough space for linux and all the apps I need.Only downside is the flip cover. It is a little fragile and took me a couple times opening it to do so in a way that I didn't feel like I was going to break it off. But as long as you're careful with it I don't see it being a problem."
5,Kingston Data Traveler a must have item,"Sometimes you want to put images from a digital camera onto a computer that does not have an SD reader slot, and you don't want to continually lug the USB connector cable around with you. The Kingston Data Traveler Reader is the perfect answer since there are very few PCs around that do not have a USB port handy. Other USB, non-thumb drive SD card readers are available but it is very convenient to have the extra 2 GB of thumb drive space for other tasks, as well as moving files from the SD card to the thumb drive. (The thumb drive has to be plugged in to a computer to do this.) So far I have owned two of the Traveler Readers because the first one was stolen and I liked the system so much that I replaced it right away. The Kingston Data Traveler Reader handles both SD and SDHC cards, making it adaptable to the rapidly changing SD card market. I highly recommend it for anyone that uses any type of SD cards."
5,Great stuff!,"Our golden retriever has had ear infections forever and now her ears are sooo much better. With the lotion (and as of the past year, a grain-free, raw diet), she's like a different dog. I use the lotion every other day and it's great. My only complaint is that they changed the packaging and the new spout doesn't work as well for me."
4,Stuff is awesome- bottle sucks,"This stuff works great and it's all natural.. But - I spilled it everywhere trying to get it in my poor dogs ear. If she wasnt so obedient she would've been all over the place as soon as I started spilling. Fix the bottle please, at the rate it's going I'm not going to have any left and I just bought it.. Plus I feel like I might be getting a bit too much in her ears, not that it does anything, its just wasteful.Otherwise, great scent, nice and gentle, my dog even seems more cheerful."
4,Runs big,"I originally bought this in Small (my 8 pound Chihuahua usually wears small), but it was way too large. I have not tried putting it in the dryer yet (it may shrink). I liked it a lot, so re-ordered it in an x-small. It fits her perfectly. I turn it inside-out when I wash it to keep it looking new (as typical with a sweater-type fabric, small balls tend to build up on it). I would buy another and recommend it to others."
1,Very biased!,"I would never say that the violation of the rights of the Japanese was at all supportable, but the author fails to take a well-rounded view of this particular camp, the local politics and politicians and a comparison of life situations of the local residents and the internees.In this particular situation and this camp, some of the more subtle issues are either glossed over or not touched on at all.I was offended by this book. I had hoped for a full story from all points of view."
1,weird,"i did a good spiritual book as much as the next gal, but i found this to be weird and just a little too ""fire and brimstone"" for kids."
1,Great 4 Dogs Horrible 4 Cats,"Do not use this shampoo on cats. I did and my older cat licked my kitten and got very sick. I had read the label and it says that it's safe for our furry pets, so I figured it must be safe for cats. I called the emergency vet and they said to immediately wash the cats with Dawn dishwashing soap and I did and the older cat felt better immediately. I wish they wouldn't imply on the label that it's safe for all pets. I love this shampoo for my dogs, too. Not sure I will buy it again, though."
5,An EXCELLENT book for -all- HTML programmers!,"I picked up this book as a newbie in HTML programming. After reading this book, I am able to do things I never dreamed of. These guys lay out questions people have in HTML and then go right over them, discussing exactly how to do it. I found it as a wonderful Beginner to Intermediate book. It's also a very awesome reference book, it doesn't completely rely on all of the code that's in the book. Very nice book. I'd recommend it to anyone that wants to learn HTML."
5,not for rough play,"My 3 year old son is crazy about forklifts - so much so that we go to [local store] twice a month just to watch them load and unload lumber. I gave him this for his birthday and he was delighted. It is fantastically detailed and the forks go up and down. I noticed right away however that the plastic is the brittle kind and waited for it to break. As expected, my son was not satisfied just lifting the little crate that comes with the set. No, he tried to lift the sofa, his brother, the refrigerator, etc. (just like a real forklift, Mommy) and broke off the fork assembly. I reattached it with electrical cable ties but now the forks can't move, which has dampened his enthusiasm. Would I buy it again? I don't think so. While the price was lower that other toy forklifts, we would have gotten more play from a more durable toy."
1,Bruder breaks 1st day & no refund,"Last Christmas we purchased the forklift and 2 other vehicles by Bruder. One arrived with a broken piece and the other 2 broke the first day. I contacted Bruder by email a few days after Christmas. I was told that after 20 days, no returns were accepted. Since I ordered the gifts prior to Christmas, I was out of luck. They never responded any further to my complaints in the quality of their product. Die Cast vehicles have been much more durable. Not only were the products brittle, but moving mechanisms seemed made to crack off so that very quickly the primary function of all the machines was broke."
1,Cheap Plastic,"Should have read reviews. Very cheap plastic, forks broke after one playtime. The plastic is sharp too. Not worth the money. Wouldn't buy from this manufacturer again."
4,My 3 year old likes it!,"As I said my 3 year old enjoys it and I'm glad we bought it but one of the black forks broke off. I put it back on with some hot melt and it seems okay. I don't know if he's typical of 3 year old or not but he is rough on things. I'd say it is well put together with a working steering wheel, tilting forks, and a wheel/crank that makes the forks go up and down. I'd buy it again. It's also the only one I could find!"
3,my nephew saw this and was stunned by it... but i don't get it.,this is a very strange toy in my estimation. however my 5 year old nephew does really seem to like it.
4,Abs,A good mix of routines. All different. The ball routine is unique. A good basic mix for all levels. Do several for a decent ab workout.
1,Terrible,I never received the item I purchased... Never heard back from the Seller. Thankfully Amazon refunded my money. It makes me very uncomfortable that a company like DVDLEGACY now has my credit card information though. I've purchased many things thru Amazon and have been completely satisfied .. this was the first time that I have not been happy with a purchase. I will continue to purchase items on Amazon - but I will be more careful which Seller I choose.
5,Greased Wheels Just Keeps on Turning,"An auspicious beginning for a new author. I'm usually a fan of more slam-bang stuff (Lee Child, John Sandford, Robert Crais) but I read Greased Wheels in one sitting. The characters are real, the pace is energetic and the plot is just darned interesting. Who woulda thought a temp worker could be a fascinating protagonist? Kyle Shannon is as intrepid as Miss Marple and as likeable as Jessica Fletcher. As a sometime fire buff, I was impressed by Linda Mickey's firefighting knowledge. And those cinnamon rolls! I couldn't get the smell out of my nose for days. . ."
3,A mixed bag,"I truly wanted to love this album. And the lyrics are profound; they are deep Pagan poetry that touches the heart. However, the instrumentation leaves much to be desired; at its worst points, it sounds a bit like a lounge act. There's far too many chintzy sounding keyboards and too few acoustic instruments and drums; I feel the poetry would have been much better served by a more ecstatic world music sound, or at least one amenable to Pagan chant.I did enjoy many of the songs on the fall and winter disk; not coincidentally, they were ones that tended to use guitars and flutes rather than keyboards."
1,extremely overrated,"This is a highly over-rated play. When performed by two actors who are less than stellar, the play comes off as yet another slight play about some very usual targets: Drunk Irishmen, stupid and vain Hollywood actors."
3,Memory review,The memory arrived in perfect conditions but it cames later than i was spected.I had not received any manual or caracteristics documentations or documents of this product.
5,ACP-EP Memory Review,Memory arrived in the time frame promised and seems to be working okay. I am very pleased with my purchase.
3,Ive had it for a week and...,ive had it for a week and had to restart my computer twice due to memory malfunctions since i installed this... hope it doesn't happen any more....
3,sheer speed,"i have never heard a band, with the exception of minor threat, which plays every song as fast as this band does. while they slow down to a reasonable speed for ""depression"", amphetamine-drenched songs like ""shot out my heart"" more then make up for it. if you are looking for musical diversity and interesting song structures, forget it. this cd has nothing but loud, fast songs in 4/4 time. of course, anyone who buys this will expect that. as fast and as monotonous (in the true sense of the word) as the guitars are on this album, there are enough catchy riffs to keep the listener interested. the lyrics are all but incomprehensible."
5,"Sunlite Bicycle 3"" Round Mirror with Red Reflector","I like the Bike Mirror because it is adjustable and fits on the bicycle bar, instead of at the end of the bar. The one I bought at Walmart fit at the end of the bar and was smaller and hard to see behind you. The Sunlite Mirror gives a real good view behind you. I feel much safer when riding on a Public Road. I'd recommend them to anyone needing a mirror for a bike."
2,Good price but too short,"Probably a good price and the mirror looks well made. But the length is too short, so you will have to either extend the length or mount it at the end of the handle bar. Mounting is easy. Doesn't work for me. I ended up giving it up, or maybe give it to someone else who could use it."
2,Hit a snag,"The mirror seems fine. Installation was easy enough, but it just wasn't long enough. I have no complaint about the quality of the product, it just doesn't fit my needs."
2,cheap,"its worth the price, cheap. i bought it for the design which is what i wanted. the mirror is small, the mounting hardware appears to be a non standard size. it really needs a wingnut but i havent found one to fit it. however, it works! i'd say its ok for slower, lower pressure bikes. vibration and the small image size make it hard to use on my roadbike"
3,"inexpensive, works, but...","The item is inexpensive and works ok.However, the mirror tends to slip out of adjustment when riding.Also, finding a suitable position that provides visibility around your body is a challenge."
2,How cheap can it be ?,This is a cheap piece of junk. I am not even putting it on my trike. I am glad I didn't buy two.
1,Not convex...,Just get one that is convex or else it's pretty worthless. Unless you're really interested in whats happening on a random 3' wide patch of road behind you...
3,too small,"the actual glass is only 2.5 inches. I am constantly readjusting it to try and find a relevant view, but then it is of very limited area of the road. On a different bike I have a mirror which is actually three inches. It is amazing how much difference the extra half inch makes."
2,Hard to use,"I bought this to help see the cars behind me. It keeps shifting position when you bump it, but even worse, when you turn your handle bars, it moves out of position. I think I will probably remove it."
4,Great truck - now it is broken,"I would have given it a five stars if I were to write this review earlier. This is truly a great vehicle - my son got it when he was 3 and half and had not stopped playing with it until recently for about 8 months. His favorate way of playing with it is scooting on it - that's how he broke the mixer, after so many trips around the apartment. I am thinking to buy another one but wondering if there is anything on the market that is similar to this one but designed for scooting, too."
5,I had chills reading it!,"Deb tells it like it is, folks. The medical community, even ""specialists"", have skirted the real seriousness of diabetes for decades. In my personal 35 year battle with Type I diabetes, I have experienced the full gamut of complications in spite of always following the proper care rules. Showdown is a page turner--I read it in one setting and had chills every second. Deb drives home that future generations shall not experience what we have endured."
5,They are amazing!,These walkie's are great esp for the money. We use them like an intercom system because my husband is bed bound and my kitchen is over 60ft away. Plus if I need to go out back for a while he can still reach me. You can not beat these for the price.
3,Kidspeak French,"This program is colorful and the graphics and songs are amusing. Be aware, though, that it is a total ""immersion"" product which means there is not always an explanation of what the animated ""teacher"" is saying. The teacher, a little girl named ""Claudine,"" just begins speaking and a child (or adult!) with no background in French may be intimidated after the first pause. You can click on a guide which gives a written English explanation of the various icons and games, but this is of no help to a young child who does not yet read well. I felt the program was useful in naming specific items you could click on, but it left me wanting more in the way of breaking down and explaining the specific words and phrases ""Claudine"" was using. A basic understanding of French prior to using this educational game would greatly increase the value of the game to a child."
5,A horror classic from the get-go!,"This collection of stories has it all. Extreme, gore-filled scenes beside meditations on transposition and Love next to unforgettable characters, crisp, smart dialogue, great plots filled with twists and turns. In other words, a classic and a must buy! Now buy the damned thing!"
5,"Humor, Sometimes Small Minds are Offended by it, Historically Speakin'","""Utah, Gateway to Nevada"" was a sheer MONUMENT to Utah's humorous side, created by three highly creative residents of the Beehive State, the late, great Neil Passey, Tim Kelly and Mark Knudsen, which was appreciated by a monstrously large number of the state's residents at the time of it's release, hence the fair sized print runs of the epic tome! It also inspired a nominee for the Utah state song way back when, searchable on youtube under the title of the book.Praise Bob for Slack & ""They'll Pay to Know, What they Really Think!"",id"
3,What an Insult!,This is a very funny book title. Imagine how the good people of Utah must feel. How insulting!
3,Really disappointed with pronunciations,"I was really looking forward to getting this but after scanning it and looking up about a dozen phrases I am already disappointed with the pronunciations. I totally agree with James C. Norton's review given above. I learned Spanish before Portuguese and this book gives pronunciations in Spanish, not Brazilian Portuguese. They are similar languages in most ways but NOT the same! It's handy for looking up particular phrases but you need to already be familiar with how you pronounce all the letters, otherwise you either need to double check pronunciation in a dictionary or sound a little silly. Handy book but there are better out there."
4,not as bad as they make it sound,"One thing you must be aware of before purchasing this is that it is a CONTINENTAL PORTUGUESE book. Hence, the pronunciation is completely different than that of Brasil. I speak both accents and it's basically like a completely different language. You'd be surprised, if you are not already familiar with the differences. Like, ""e"" is not pronunced at the ends of words, the ""r""'s in the beginning of words are not pronounced as ""h""'s but more like a throaty trill (not like spanish, a bit raspier). The vowels are pronounced more closed. Also, continental portuguese's grammar can be quite a bit trickier.So, ignore all those comments about the pronunciation being incorrect. It's just simply different.If you are looking for Brazilian pronunciations, don't look here."
2,"Limited, but good for tourists","Very small, both size and number of pages, so it fits in your pocket. It offers a very limited set of phrases, geared to the tourist seeking help with finding their way around. If you are looking to actually learn Portuguese, you may want to pass on this book. At $1.95 it would be a nice pocket phrase book for tourists to Brasil."
3,Please....,"An verage display from worst Oz Hip-Hop has to offer. Although this clandestined group of semi-nothings have reached moments of 'respect' their repetive themes and abuse of pop influences leaves the imagination at the door. If you are interested in Oz hip-hop, check something a little more consistant and witty, koolism, curse of dialect or tzu."
1,This is not even close to funny.,"This is not within shooting distance of funny.I doubt it's even in a similar time continuity.Someone made TEN tracks out of something a five year old wouldn't be amused by?I guess this is perfect to put on repeat at your holiday family gathering to put a stop to the proceedings in a timely fashion.Now that I think about it, it would at least be extremely effective crowd control. I'm still rating this a one, if only for incorrect categorization under 'music' and not ""insurance that the in-laws and unwanted relatives won't be spending a full, uncomfortable weekend with you and yours"" or ""how to insure you are never again invited to the lame office Christmas party."""
4,Review: America Goes To War,"Charles Patrick Neimeyer's ""America Goes To War"" was a well researched, documented, and written book. Neimeyer explains who served in the Continental Army, the reasons they served and the difficult lives the soldiers had. The text is annotated throughout with supporting evidence and an extensive bibliography gives the reader several sources for further study.However Neimeyer's conclusions do have a leftest bias that caused this reader to question several of the interpretations of the information presented. Also very little of the warfare between the British and American armies was explored in this book and the affect it would have on the social history of the American Army.Over all this is a good book to understand the men who served in the Continental Army and some of the reasons why."
5,Janie Fricke Greatest Hits CD,"This is a great listen if you like classic country music. It differs from the newer country as most of these songs come from the 80's, so if you like pure country you will enjoy this CD."
4,Love's Old Country Music,"This 17 Greatest Hits Of Janie Fricke's is good but it could have been better. There are at least 2 song missing from it. Those songs are: WHAT'RE DOING TONIGHT and PLEASE HELP ME, I'M FALLING. But I would still HIGHLY RECOMMEND this CD."
4,Star Trek Voyager - The Complete Seventh Season,"Always nice to watch, but would be even better if in Widescreen."
4,Voyager ends it's journey on a high note,"After six previous season that ranged from good to ho-hum, Star Trek Voyager final season gives us some good episodes (Shattered,Lineage, Prophecy,Human Error,Author, Author) among the less than steller (Drive,Body and Soul, Workforce, Q2,Renaissance Man).The finale episode Endgame, opted for an action packed finale, rather than service the crew with the kind of resolution befitting to these beloved characters of this less than stellar series.Special Features:Braving the Unknown: Season 7Voyager Time Capsule: The DoctorComing Home: The Final EpisodeReal Science with Andre BormanisThe Making of Borg Invasion 4-DLost Transmissions from the Delta Quadrant"
3,"Good episode, but very bad transfer.","This episode, Ep. 22 ""Homestead"" has no sound effects and no music, as if those sound tracks were never transferred from whatever source material. The other episode are fine; I don't understand why they would sell this one as it is."
2,F'ing terrible,"A really poorly-executed good idea. Star Trek always requires a lot of suspension of disbelief, but this ep had so many holes that it was well nigh unwatchable. You felt like you had to finish it, though, because you'd already wasted an hour on part one. Still, skip it--go for a walk or something more worthwhile instead."
2,poor vendor,IT was not an original set----difficult to find episodes. Not as good as previously purchased similar items. would not buy from this vender again.
3,Relationships...AMIRITE?!,"This episode is about as sterotypical as they come. B'Elanna acts the like typical over-emotional, bury-my-feelings, can't-be-satisfied-ever woman and Tom is the typical DUDE that does dude stuff while being insensitive to the woman's ""needs"". And Neelix reaches an all time low in my book when he acts like B'Elanna best girlfriend (you know the fat ugly one that never gets a date) as he proceeds to talk trash about Tom and how he should cater to her every whim like a castrated man slave.Aside from the relationship turmoil a space race is also happening...I don't know how they did it...but they managed to make a freaking RACE IN SPACE WITH SPACESHIPS boring. I didn't think that was possible...Well....the race suits looked cool at least, so props to wardrobe...."
1,Lazy Ending.,"Not a real ending. Lazy. This ending could have come at the end of season 1. After over a hundred episodes, they could have done some lead-up to the end.Seriously lame.Original Star Trek from the 1960s had a better finale."
2,Sorry for the clipshow...,"It seems as though the only purpose for this episode was to recap and justify the absurdity that has followed on the 6 preceding seasons of Voyager. Well, that and to give several actors one last chance to resurrect their characters (e.g. Seska).About half way through the episode I was humming ""Sorry for the Clipshow"" from The Simpsons (link:[...])."
5,"Some of the Best ""Trek"" Ever!","Voyager got of to a shaky start, but the seventh and final season bubbles over with the magic that makes Star Trek the phenomena that it is. The series finally, ""End Game I & II"" is, for me, the best Star Trek story ever. Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) breaks stereotypes by being a powerful female leader who does not sacrifice her femininity in the process. She can be as diplomatic as Picard or as ruthless as Kirk without missing a beat. Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) discovers her humanity and proves again that women can be both beautiful and powerful. The Doctor (Robert Picardo, a truly gifted actor), who's character is a hologram, adds both comic relief and expands the definition of life itself. Testing the limits of the human potential is what makes Star Trek great and this season of Voyager shows us just how powerful, alluring, and compassionate humanity can be."
5,Fantastic,"We now have all seven seasons and usually watch them over again once a year. Great concept, great characters. Wish it could have gone on longer."
2,Not what I expected,"I ordered this item with the understanding that it would be new. Two of the discs skip during at least one episode and it looks like a copy that was made, but advertised as ""new."" I have purchased all 7 seasons from Amazon.com sellers and with the exception of one other season, all of the rest came in factory sealed boxes and contained the original discs. A bit disappointed that I paid the same amount for this as I did for the others and got a lesser product."
3,A little off,"A comic relief ep. Not bad, but not great either. Seven isn't quite as good as Data at acting, but it's entertaining enough."
5,Perfect Ending for a Perfect Series,"Great last season of Star Trek Voyager. I love the episodes that had humor in them like Body and Soul, and Author Author. And of course the last episode End Game was wonderful and heart warming. A must see for any fan. Captain Janeway kept her promise and got her crew home."
1,Media Failures,"This media fails on my LiteOn DVD/VCR Recorder LVC-9015G.Several attempts were made for four of the 15 disks in the pack, and all failed to initiaize."
5,My family loves these,I bought it for my brother for Christmas cause that's what everyone else in the family has so I'd be sure it was compatible. Can't find them in stores around here anymore so I was glad to find it & be able to purchase it on Amazon.
4,just ok,"I bought this for my son to use hunting. I wish that I'd spent a little more & purchased the next one up, the green one. It doesn't do the same stuff at all!& isn't as powerful as the green one's.My son was grateful for the gift, but I could tell he was a little dissapointed. Don't make the same misstake!Spend a little more & buy up scale one."
3,Not sure about this unit !,"I thought this is what I wanted, now I'm not so sure.I bought it for a few reasons;I sail and wanted to be able to call for help if I needed to but there is no chanel 16 (help channel)on this unit.I also wanted the gps so I could find my way back in the fog. despite reading the two booklets and playing with the unit I'm still cant seem to figure out how to use it.So, I'm now looking for a proper marine radio so I can call for help.I guess this old sea dog is just too old to figure out this new tech stuff"
3,Weak Transmission and Reception Capabilities,"The unit is quite functional, though when used in a rugged wooded setting, such as hunting, the reception and transmission capabilities are lacking. I was recently elk hunting and the other members in the group had the fancier Garmin Rhino GPS units, which significantly outperformed the Rhino 110. I bought on price point, thinking that I might lose out on some of the bells and whistles of the other higher end units that I wouldn't ultimately need, but in the end the 110 didn't have the horsepower and resulted in a number of instances where I couldn't communicate with the other group members and I was separated by less than two miles in a relatively unobstructed environment."
3,DO NOT PURCHASE IF!,"Every picture I saw advertised for this unit showed detailed maps. Even in the owner's manual on several pages you'll see detailed maps downloaded from MapSource. This is not possible, even if you purchased the expensive software, it is not possible to download this info to the Rino 110 Unit. If you can live with a totally blank screen and 'bread crumbs' (because this is all you get in the GPS mode) then this unit is okay. If you would like more detail or even the most basic detail in the GPS mode, then purchase the 120 or 130 unit. These units will store additional info and include the cable for downloading from laptop to unit. The 110 does not include the cable. I own a 110 and 120 unit and both are great and are easy devices to work with but beware of the 110's blank screen in the GPS mode, it offers nothing but a blank screen and bread crumbs! (items were purchased for deer hunting and emergencys)"
1,Couldn't make it work,The Moen valve that this cartridge goes in has a plastic nut that damages easily and requires a special tool. Just call Moen and get a new valve for free. I couldn't use this cartridge and the Amazon market place merchant required a restocking fee and return postage which made it not worth it to return. Moen warranties all kitchen valves for a lifetime.
3,Good quality cartridge kit.,"The cartridge kit was a single item and not a 'kit' as I expected. Since it was for a dual faucet, I assumed it would be for both faucets. It is expensive for just one faucet."
4,Moen part,Developed a leaky faucet. Took me some time to find out that it was made by Moen (no markings on the faucet what so ever). Contacted Moen but they did not honor warranty on their parts. Ordered the part online (was the least expensive any where). Too some hassle to install but it works well.
2,"Wasn't Bad., wasn't Good.., **21/2* stars","Inheritance is one of those movies where you've got the great star cast, You got the perfect location, a workable set, decent cameras & lightin.., But mannn!, Your script is weak when it came time to put the ""Boo!!!"" into people... It was about as scary as holding a flashlight up to the chin.. When you decorate your house for Holloween scary.., Being pulled over by a cop scary.., The script was just weak... The young actors have done some Great stuff, I can vouche for them.., But the director & producers weren't serious about this product when it came to suspense or horror, Even the ""Ritual"" love scene drew a ""Yawn"" and we're talking about the "" Up & Coming"" Golden Brooks who's movie debut didn't leave any singed or wow recall in my mind the way a Sanaa, Halle, Gabrielle or any ""idol worthy"" actress gets a ""double take"" for... the movie's a watchable C+"
1,WORST BLACK HORROE MOVIE YET MADE,SAD TO SAY I HAVE SEEN MANY BUT THIS WAS THE WORST SO LITTLE SPECIAL EFFECTS AND SMALL CAST OF GOOD VERY GOOD AFRICAN AMERICAN ACTORS BUT USED VERY MUCH WRONG COULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER MOVE LOW BUDGET BAD LIGHTING AND BAD JUST PLAIN BAD ALL AROUND
5,Short and sweet!,"Yikes! Could these guys have possibly put out more great records? Everything that the mighty Devil Dogs touch turns into rock'n'roll gold and "" Choad Blast "" is no exception. As one reviewer put it "" Radio Beat is one of the best songs The Devil Dogs ever recorded"". These tunes were recorded during the making of the mighty "" Saturday Night Fever "" album and will not disappoint Devil Dogs fans."
1,"all promises, no delivery","I ordered on Nov.7, '08. As of today, Nov. 28, I got my fourth or fifth notice that the order is delayed. For three weeks, I've been trying to cancel the order, but the Seller has had it listed as ""shipping soon"" the entire time. So, I cannot reach anyone, and I cannot cancel the order. Not nice."
3,Not for us,This is a quality item but we didn't use it as much as we thought we would and our son outgrew it quick.
4,A wonderful work saver,"I agree with all the other reviews that say that this book has everything you could possibly want for writing a Security Policy for your company. The price includes a single-company license for copying the copyrighted text into your security policy. Consultants will need to purchase a new license for each company they develop a policy for.As the ""Version 7"" implies, this is a work in progress. As such, I expected to see a ""Reader's Comment Form"" at the back so the reader could notify the author of subjects he might add in the next version or of errors or omissions detected. There is no such form. I also found that I received only canned or sluggish sales responses from the email address listed on the back cover. I was surprised to find such a poorly-managed business associated with such an excellent book."
4,I thought I was ordering a STEEL pin punch as in the photo!,"I ordered a brass punch and what I thought was a STEEL pin punch just like it. What arrived in the mail was TWO brass punches. Now, I notice the ""B"" in the part number and that is the same as the listing for the brass punches.They are of high quality of course. But, I wish someone would change the image or sell what is shown in the image."
3,Looks Cute,"I don't have a Puppy in my Pocket, but I think they look really cute and it'd be fun to carry them around with you. I can just imagine bringing one to school and instantly starting a new trend. These really do look cute and adorable. It could kind of be like taking care of a Tamagachi, but more fun for younger kids who like to play make-beleive. Pretty cool.(P.S. I only rated it 3 stars because I don't own one, so I don't know if they are fun or not!)"
5,"Frightening, Captivating, and Amazing!","Last summer while on vacation in Myrtle Beach, I happened down to Georgetown County for a day on the Winyah. The scenery was breathtaking, as was this book. It was an excellent works and I especially liked being able to read history of places I have been. This book is absolutely wonderful."
4,What your 5th graders needs to know,I was very impressed with this product. I got it in a timely manner and have really enjoyed going through the book and reading it. I would definitely recommend it to any teacher or future teacher. My education advisor recommended it as a way to study for the Praxis exam and it has really helped.
5,exactly what i needed,I am a student at USU and trying to get into the education program. Professors reccomended this book to study to pass the Praxis iI exam. I was worried this wasn't going to be the right book my professors were suggesting I buy because I didn't recognize the orange cover but it is! Its exactly what I needed to study to pass my Praxis exam!
1,Essentially nonsense....,"...practically nothing presented in this book ""needs"" to be known by a fifth grader...Moorish architecture?...formula for the volume of a rectangular prism??...John Phillip Sousa???...it totally glosses over what should be essentials -- using basic logic, understanding analogies, problem solving tactics, etc...skip it."
2,Core Knowledge??,"I would agree that this book (and the others like it by Hirsch) offer a basis for valuable information. However, I would warn you to supplement a literacy curriculum with other stories and authors that include cultures other than European American. Look closely at the contents and you will notice that his view of ""American literate culture"" is overwhelmingly European-American based. I agree that students need to learn ""American literate culture,"" however, curriculum needs to represent the many people that make up our diverse nation.5th Grade Teacher"
1,Superficial,"Good for someone who wishes to have information in one place, but not a reasonable expectation of what every stereotypical fifth grader would learn in a given year."
3,This is NOT a Sony Vaio battery,"I just received this battery and have not installed it as yet. I believe that the description of this product is deceiving as it implies that this is a Sony battery. The battery pictured on the item description page clearly says ""Vaio"" but the shipped product does not. I have no idea how this battery will work, but it is not what I expected."
1,updated review: dead after 6 months,"UPDATED REVIEW: after six months of light use this battery doesn't hold any useful charge. I have another one of these extended batteries (which I use in a very similar way) which, after three years, still works very well and gives more than 4 hours of use. My guess is that Sony made a large batch and they have been sat in storage somewhere. So I have wasted my money with this second one!! ORIGINAL REVIEW: Came half charged, works fine with SZ61MN/B (European version of the US SZ600), about 4.5 hours run time with everything running full tilt (max. brightness, wifi connected etc.). Be careful if you have a Vaio and are looking for an extended battery, there are some sites which suggest that the VGP-BPL2 battery will fit the SZ6 laptops - it won't physically fit - you do need this VGP-BPL9."
4,You can count on Better Homes and Gardens,"You can always count on Better Homes and Gardens to provide excellent information on any subject. So, of course, you can trust them with information about your little one."
1,Irritating and poor value,"Cheap amateur production, poor value for money at only 30min runtime. Narrator has very irritating voice. Repetitive. Any home video would be more entertaining."
3,Life Lessons book of romans,"This book and all of the life lessons are good books, but the only issue I have with this piticular one is that it is his old one and not the updated version. With my group that I study with it is a little confusing to everyone. Next time I will probably stick to ordering the paperback with everyone else. That is the only thing wrong with ordering on the Kindle. I have other books on my kindle that I am very satisfied with.Thank,Wendi"
1,Not as good as it looks,"I have gone through two of these beds. Both beds have sprung leaks within the first dozen or so uses. Minor wear and tear resulted in small leaks in the surface and the repair kit is not up to the task. In additon, the two way air valve is vulnerable and fragile. It too leaked. My poor houseguest woke up wrapped in the mattress rather than resting upon it."
3,weak plug,I love the aerobed but it looses air and always has but now the top is real loose and I have no one to help me get it fixed. What was a slow leak now is a fast 15 second leak and the bed can not be used. But I do love the concept.
1,"Disasterous lack of support, Buggy software",I purchased the version 3.1 and suffered frequent lock ups so I thout I'd bite the bullet and buy the version 4.0 so called PRO version. Now I cannot connect at all with the people I used to enjoy chatting with. When I Email requests Customer support I might as well do it with the computer turned off and they have the nerve to charge extra ($25?) for telephone support.
2,Wouldn't miss this book if I lost it,"Probably the people that gave this book a good review are the same people onthe covor - there are 10 people on the cover, count 'em ten. How can 10 people write a cohesive book?Anyway, I got this book when I wasa beginner in SSIS, and now have a lot of experience with SSIS. Hardly ever have I found this book helpful. The instructions and examples are thin, and never seem to cover what I'm looking for. Only found a couple of topics like logging, or event handling with a little good info to get me started.If I threw this book away I wouldn't miss it"
2,Conceptual Integration Lacking,"While this text does contain quite a bit of information about SSIS and its functionality, it does not do a good job of relating or building an overarching conceptual framework for understanding. Specifically, I appreciate a learning text that simultaneously teaches the ""how to's"" along with a vision of ""why"" things are done as they are. This latter consideration is extremely helpful when we leave the domain of canned examples and venture forth into the real world.I suspect that when a team of authors assembles a text, as in this case, we get the benefit of vertical expertise but miss out on the encapsulated/synthesized wisdom that a single author conveys as he/she walks us through a detailed technology tool.After 7 chapters in this text I switched to Microsoft Press': ""SQL Server 2005 Integration Services, Step by Step"" - for which I have written a more favorable Amazon review."
2,Not recommanded,This book is hard to read. The samples are difficult to follow. There is no coherent between chapters. It was a rush. Not recommanded.
2,OK - but confusing,I agree with the other 2 and 3 star ratings. I tried to do a pivot using this book and got absolutely no where. I find the book layout confusing and the step by steps SKIP some steps which is more than a little annoying.
3,"Good, but where's the VB sample code?","SSIS only supports scripting in VB. But whenever there's a custom component or any code outside the mandatory VB realm, the book only presents a C# example. Even the WROX website does not provide VB code. So if I want to code my custom data flow task, or follow their wmi example, I MUST know C#. I can follow along okay, but I don't like having to interpret/rewrite your code samples to be able to use them and extend upon them.The general information is good, but don't think this book will leave mold you into an SSIS Expert. I only bought this book because I first bought the WROX ""expert"" ssis book, which started by saying they assume you have substantial knowledge of ssis, such as provided by this book.All in all, the book is a decent introduction to SSIS. I didn't suffer from the 10 author continuity loss as others did. I just want my examples in VB, especially for a product that only speaks VB for many functions."
2,Half baked product,"Yes, authors are very knowledgeable, but the book is very difficult to read and to learn SSIS.I am DBA/ Data Warehousing / ETL developer with over 10 years in the field and had real trouble following the ""story"" and small print that dominates the book. WORX should really do a better job in editing and formatting the book. The code examples are very difficult to read and follow. No consistent presentation format. In many examples authors make statements and comment before presenting the problem. The whole book written in a ""story"" style and lacks structure and formatting to make it more readable. Many errors and WORX Forums for the book is no help. Problems and questions posted on Forum are neglected and not addressed. It is really a shame when a book with a lot of good info is so badly written and edited."
4,Great Book,This is a good book on some very practical examples for all types of transformations within SSIS. Definitely recommend this book if you are having diffciulty in piecing together an SSIS Package.Well done Wrox once again!
5,A must-have book for anyone serious about SSIS,"Professional SQL Server 2005 Integration Services does an outstanding and thorough job of covering SQL Server 2005 Integration Services. SSIS is huge and the expert authors cover everything a serious SSIS developer needs to know. For those familiar with DTS, the book provides valuable information on transitioning to the new SSIS architecture. This book is essential for anyone wanting to use SSIS to its fullest potential."
2,"Move along, nothing to see here.","Lucinda is a major twit through the first half of this book, and Heath isn't that much better. All in all, this story was kind of ... annoying. If you're an LK fan like me, consider skipping this one. You will not be missing much."
4,Love Come to Me,"A little over priced, could,t put the book down read until my eyes hurt. Riviting, want to read more of her books"
3,"Not very good, but good try","Lisa Kleypas tells you in the intro that this was one of her first attempts at writing a novel. You can really tell. It's not very good and instead of showing you things and painting things for your imagination, she simply states things. I think she could have spent some time revising it to make it into a decent book. Unfortunately, because it is a Lisa Kleypas book, I spent full price on it. The romance isn't very good. The heroine seems like a spoiled brat through most of it too. I enjoyed the post Civil War aspects of it though."
2,Hard to Read,After reading this earlier piece of work by a savvy author who can turn a phrase brilliantly today I was able to forgive even myself for how terrible my first book must have been. I love historical romances centered around the Civil War era but this was too much telling and not enough plotting. Unfortunately it was difficult to breathe real life in any of the unrealistic characters. And that is what they were...characters but not really people. I did like the earlier chapters but then it just simply died...dead...nothing. Oh well.
3,Not as good as her other books :(,"I have read just about every Lisa Kleypas book I can get my hands on. She's a great historical romance author. I'm not one to write reviews about books but this one was just meh. One reviewer wrote that it was at times long, uneventful, and boring. I agree. Her books are predictable in that the end usually reaches some kind of climax before it's resolved and everything ends happily (which is my favorite kind of book! hahah). This book's 'climax' just doesn't live up to Kelypas standards. No big problem ever really arises that leaves you dying to know what will happen next (not elaborating because I don't want to spoil anything!). It's just alright. Wasn't my favorite. Good thing she has like 50 other books!"
2,A little Angry,"I heard there was a NEW Lisa Kleypas book coming out this fall and I was so excited I ordered it for my reader without taking anytime to review here on Amazon. Yes I know it was my fault for not doing the research, but as she is an automatic buy I just went for it. I do not like early American Colonial reads so this was my first issue. And basically her writing has improved so much over the years, it just came off a little light for me. I have learned and I wrote this for everyone who is impulsive and so quick to purchase without doing your homework!As I was reading the new books for the fall I see that MS Kleypas has another NEW (old) book coming in October.... now I feel a bit of resentment in the fact that they are calling these new releases. I am new to the genre and know now to be very careful when making purchases. Its so disappointing."
2,Not like her other books,"I read the whole book through, barely. I kept hoping for it to pick up but it didn't. I could find no room in my heart for Lucy or how Heath could either. The book also dragged a lot. I literally rushed through the book. I won't hold this against Mrs. Kleypas since 90% of her books are great reads. Hopefully the next installment won't disappoint."
4,love come to me,"This is a reprint. If you did not read this, I would definitely recommend this book. Lisa Kleypas is one of my favorite authors."
5,loved it,"I do not like Civil war novels, but i love this writer. I have read all her books so i forced myself to read this one and it was so worth it. I absolutley love the fact that he loved her from day one and just kept trying to win her over. I thought the history was necessary for the story but not overdone. I work in a bookstore and recommend it all the time."
4,Good read,Starts out a bit slow but story gets better and better. The historical aspects was adds depth and not overdone. This story is refreshing and unlike her other works in which the formula had gotten very repetitive.
2,Love took too long!,The passion was there but I didn't like that it took them so long to get together. Months would go by in between the times that they would make love. That's was very annoying.
2,Not in the same league as Wallflowers of Hathaways,"I knew this was a re-release ie early Kleypas but I thought it was worth a shot anyway. It probably works fine on its own, if you don't know how great the author is now. I can't tell you how many times I've reread the Wallflowers and Hathaways series and there are plenty of her standalones that are amazing too. This story lacks the emotional connection we've come to expect from Kleypas and there's too much filler that doesn't do anything to progress the characters or story. Here and there you can see glimmers of the writer Kleypas becomes but I'm not sure it's in her best interest to re-release books that are so inferior to her current offerings. Again, in the scope of romance novels, it's good (not great). But for a Kleypas romance, it's sub-par. Better to re-read Where Dream Begin again."
2,Disappointed,"I have always loved Lisa Kleypas' books but I had trouble getting though this one. I found the heroine difficult to like and the hero wasn't much better. Out of all her works, I liked this one the least. I wouldn't recommend it."
5,Worked as expected!,"I bought this because everyone else in my hunting party had a similar model last year and recommended I get one. It worked as I expected, with the main purpose to be able to see where everyone in the hunting party was in relation to where I was. It has a lot of cool features!"
3,It's OK,"The 120 has all the features I want, except that the screen is nearly impossible to read for a far-sighted old guy. I can see why Garmin upgraded it on later models. For the price, though, I'm satisfied with it. I just have to remember to carry reading glasses..."
1,It's currently defective,"I bought 3 units and they all have the same problem: the slightest impact can cause them to lose power and require that the power be switched back on. Specifically, when dropped from a height of less than an inch, they shut off w/o beeping or other notice. While attempting to use them in practice, everyone's unit was always off due to this problem, so I will be returning mine in the hope that they will fix this problem in future units. The problem is that the batteries are on squishy springs, unlike the Motorola Talkabout's taut ones; and the circuit lacks a capacitor or other means of storing milliseconds worth of power. They will probably fix it, so not the date of this review: 12/3/02.Also, I assumed that the units would provide automatic position updates to others in a group, but discovered that it only transmits one's location if one presses TALK. Perhaps this will be fixed by a future software release."
4,GPS Great/ Radio,"In Regards to the GPS functions/features it a great deal for the price. While the 2 way radio, well my title says it all, it's not a Motorola. The microphone is not sensitive enough no matter how loud you talk into mic, in addition people can not here you on other 2 way radios. However on Dec 23, 2002 new firmware (version 2.20) was released, and this appears to have fixed the several key issues, i.e. the microphone sensitive."
1,Unit continually locks up,"My unit is in Iraq in combat. We made the mistake of purchasing 30 of these units, 1 for each soldier and they are a disaster.They lock up continually for no reason, whether using only the GPS or only the radio or both.Our serial numbers indicate they are fairly new models and we have a series of them starting with 39914168, but I have talked with other owners of this unit here in country and they attest to the same problem.Imagine you are on a combat patrol and you are using the Garmin as a commo device between the men of your team. You keep calling for the lead vehicle but he doesn't respond because his radio has locked up once again. He doesn't know this of course because the screen is still on (sometimes).I'm more than disappointed, I'm kind of angry because we had the opportunity to buy Motorolas and the reliable Etrex Garmins which would have saved us nearly $100 per soldier and given us something reliable."
1,Garmin Rino 120,"GPS signal is very poor. I ordered two of these and a month and a half later one of them already is malfunctioning and I cannot return or exchange it because I've had it over a month. I would not buy this item again or recommend it. I would buy two separate items in the future, a GPS tracker and a separate radio. For being Garmin built it's certainly on the lower end."
4,Still Ticking.,"This is my 2nd garmin product, GPS V Deluxe being the first. I admit when I first purchased this product, I had mixed feelings. There were problems with the microphone clarity as compaired to motorola's frs group. However, one thing with Garmin is that they are always working on their products, www.garmin.com, updated software for you to download and update your units. Location and map detail on this unit matches that found in the GPS V, right down to the on screen options. My two complaints: 1)Batterious Carniverous... ie Eats Batteries, prefers AAs. 2)I have a bike mount for this unit, and when subject to vibrations, it sometimes shuts itself off. This has become a geocacher's friend, more so if you have more then 1 person you go caching with."
1,Not as good as I thought,The gps i purchased was nothing like the condition described by the seller. Gps was not in good condition. It would not hold a charge for more than a half hour and would heat up so much I thought it would melt. So buyer beware products not like described.
2,Radio won't work with Mororolla's FRS,Radio won't work with motorolla's FRS radios - transmissions from garmin sound encrypted and are untintelligble on motorolla radios. Found better reception between 2 motorolla frs channels than 2 garmin's on gmrs. Kinda steamed - hope internet retailer will take them back . . . .
4,Mostly Pleased,"I have not put a lot of time on this so far. One thing I am not the most happy with is the accuracy on the maps. It is fairly close but it will show you traveling paralell to the road you are supposed to be on. It does however put a circle of accuracy on the map with you. You are withing that circle of accuracy, so it is working correctly.It has the capabilities to work with mapping programs other than the one that Garmin sells. I used mine with Microsoft Map Point. It worked great. The accuracy was much better on my laptop than on the screen of the 120.I plan on using this for marking some specific points on some property then using it to navagate back to them in the dark. I hope it works well for that...."
4,Hunting GPS - Garmin Rino 120,"Very nice GPS. It will take me some time to get used to all of its features. I would recommend this for others, especially if you hunt large woods were you could get ""turnaround"" (aka lost)."
5,Rhino 120 GPS,"This is a great product! I recommend it to anyone who is a serious hunter, fisher, or just travels a lot! I'd give it more than five stars if I could!"
3,short battery life,I have the rino120 dnathe bartters go dead in about 3days. Is there somthing that i can plug into my 12v system in my car or logging truck cig liter.i am always on the road and it is hard to put batters in it while moving . thank you . larry logan 4008 wilson way lincoln dalif 95648.
2,Underimpressed,"This is my first GPS. I was underimpressed with its reception for both the radio and the GPS. I hope this is not ""State of the Art""."
4,hunters dream,My first unit had a defective radio and Garmin swapped it out and saved my waypoints. Suggest you buy ear bud w/ PTT mic. My hunting parties used them and it coordinated our hunts accurately especially sending waypoints. Bring batteries since 6hrs seems to be useable time. If money is not an issue buy 530 model since the radio power is 5 watt versus 1/2 watt and the togel switch is easier to use. Overall it made hunting with a group better.
3,Good other than battery issues,"The unit has some great features, I love the tracback and goto. I am new to using a GPS and find these very valuable. The problem is the batteries now do not last more than 1-2 hours. The first set I put in the unit lasted substantially longer, at least 10 hours. I quite literally went through two sets of batteries (first set I thought were duds)in 4 hours this weekend, without even using heavily. I searched around and looked through the manual, but there is no documentation to this problem."
5,Antidote to Bad White Boy Rap,Anyone who is fed up of white boys trying to be black MUST listen to this.MC Lars Horris doesn't even try to pretend he's anything other than a normal white guy doing the genre of music he loves (can you imagine DMX doing a song called 'Make Way For Ducklings'?). He proves you don't have to imitate black rap artists to find a credible angle for a white rap artist and has carved out his very own niche - part Beastie Boys part Beck.
1,Lots of Errors,"I at first admired this AP Prep book for its concise format and practice problems, but as I made my way through the book more and more ERRORS kept showing up. I understand that humans are apt to err but the amount of errors and the seriousness of these faults are not permitable for an AP Prep book. For example the book incorrectly wrote the Nerst Equation, which is important part of Electrochemistry. The practice questions and review exams are helpful, but I would not recommend this book for those of who are reviewing due to errors. Try The Princeton Review, it is very much superior for review ."
4,"Wow, that's harsh...","Surprised to see such low scoring. While I do attest that there were MULTIPLE errors--definitely way more than should be allowed--they were pretty apparent, even to me. That's why one should always cross reference. I should mention that I was doing pretty horribly in my chem class at school. Now I won't say this book turned me around, but it definitely helped. Why? Because the practice was nearly impossible. The work grueling and painful. I barely scraped by with a 4, max, on any practice. But it prepared me for everything. I ended up with a 5."
2,Not awesome,"Not an AP chem student, I am trying to use this book to get a general review of chemistry and it is not proving all that helpful. A whole lot of knowledge is assumed, and while I have taken chemistry several times before, I still want to be reminded of the definitions of words that are in bold (and thus evidently important to know). The explanations are not very clear, and practice problems pop up without any previous explanation of the material. Were I currently immersed in AP chem and cruising along, this book would probably be fine, but if you're trying to use it as a supplement to the class, you may want to check out another book."
5,"Christmas Album, by Ray Conniff","One selection on this album stands out from all the rest. I don't know of another artist who has recorded ""The Real Meaning of Christmas"". However, on this album, the Conniff group presents an outstanding rendition of the beautiful song. The lyrics are masterful, especially as they relate to the world in which we live today.The other tried and true Christmas selections on the album are just just as inspiring. No, it would not be Christmas without the music of Ray Conniff and the singers."
1,Hyundai Cordless Drill,Very poor product. It barely has enough power to screw a screw into wood without running out of power. I would not suggest this purchase even for it's cheap price.
3,Framing former forms,"3 1/2Although mellowing out considerably on its second side, Quartet remains one of Hancock's stronger traditional post-bop offerings."
1,negative stars,"just as with the other tai chi dvd from this supplier, the english version cannot be accessed. after one month i recieved no communication from them, and so have lost the price of the dvd and its postage."
1,Its ok,"I have had this program for a while now, the thing i hate about it is, the fact that you cant draw out the samples and have them suit your needs, and it crashes a lot, sometimes you cant restart it. Most programs like acid, FL STUDIO, and other programs do make mp3's you just have to look for it. I would rather use a professional program then use something that looks like it came off a video game and sounds like one. The samples they give you aren't that great, they sound terrible and sound like im back in the 80's again. so if i were you get the demo first then see if you like it still"
2,problem with vista?,i coudnt get this to work right in windows vista gave me an error when trying to install i think the second cd :-(
5,Just right,Our English as a Second Language class had a new Russian student and we were already using the Spanish and Portuguese editions of this book so I bought the Russian edition. The student is thrilled to have it available! Shipping was quick.
3,Great Business Model,"It's a great business model since they use the exact same pictures for every language and just translate the word list into different languages for their different books. The issue is that the Russian translations are that good. There are blatant mistakes, as has been mentioned in previous reviews, but there are also many very uncommon Russian words, or awkward translations into Russian. I'm sure a native Russian could work around that in most cases, but I would never recommend this book to an English speaker learning Russian.The book is very nicely published. Beautiful full-color pictures and loads of words."
3,Rare Brahms 2 performance by Horenstein,"Classical collectors know what a special conductor Horesnstein was. I bought simply for the fact it was a stereo recording of the Brahms second symphony. Horenstein has the GREATEST version of the Brahms 1st symphony (the Checky recording, not the inferior Vox, or the live performance in Paris on Music and Arts) so I was curious about this. It's a very good performance, but lacking the broad emotional sweep that Walter and Stokowski bring to this. The audio quality is not bad, if somewhat lacking slightly in highs. Easily improved by boosting your treble. Horenstein really takes let's the emotions go in the 4th movement though. The ending is as exciting as you can get! So although not the best of the seconds, certainly a very good one and it allows us to hear him plays a Brahms symphony that is otherwise missing from his recorded discography."
5,Wonderful for bedtime,"I love this CD. I use it at night to fall asleep and it works. It's very soft and soothing, perfect after a long hard day of work! I also like to listen to it when I want to relax or work on school work. It even calms my hyper dogs down when I put it on ;) It was exactly the type of relaxing music I was looking for."
1,Absolute zero tech support,"The capture feature on VideoStudio does not work with either my Dazzle DVC 100 unit or my Panasonic G150 camera. Both are recognized in menu but don't work. Several other programs have worked well with my computer setup, only VidelStudio fails. I have queried Ulead tech support three times and customer support once. The only response is they will get back to me as soon as possible After two months of efforts with zero response it is clear Ulead has NO TECH SUPPORT. Don't but this if you want to capture video. It is bad software with zero suppor."
1,Fails on Performance,"A fairly nice and intuitive interface makes it easy to create the project you want. It's when you render the project that the software lets you down. Videostudio will create artifacts and noise. For example, it has a slick pan and zoom feature for slides, but it cannot handle the simple task of re-sizing your megapixel still photos to fit in video formats. The results? dancing pixels, shimmering and blurry pictures. If you go to the Ulead forums, they recommend that you resize your pictures closer to video format. Besides the absurdity of resizing hundreds of pictures to suit one poorly executed piece of software, what is the point of having the pan and zoom feature one wonders?Avoid this program, it is as poorly written as Pinnacle Software's Studio dud. I am still looking for a video editing program that performs as advertised. It is a shame one cannot sue these companies for fraud."
2,Crashes,I just purchased this software and it has crashed everytime I use it. I didn't safe a movie I was working on and lost everything. I am very dissatisfied. I am trying to do more homework and find a movie editing software that is more stable. This was very disappointing.
1,Unstable and Very Poorly supported,"I started off OK and copied 3 home VHS tapes. Then it crashed. deleted it and reloaded it and it didn't work. I loaded it on another computer and it didn't work. Their PDF ""manual"" is horrible; very VERY little detailed help. Their on line support is a joke too; by the time you fill out all the questions you're to pissed off to describe the problem. And, there's no telephone number to call that I could find anyway.I bought it at a computer store and don't have the sales slip so I'm out the 60 bucks or whatever. OK, I knew better than to toss it. But this product and its ""support"" is a major disappointment so far. I see there are some good reviews here so maybe I have a ""bug"" in the Magic Box thing that comes with it. I dunno. But I consider my copy anyway a complete waste of money."
1,VS9 IS CRAP-OLA!!! ... THE O'L 52-FAKE-OUT! :(:(:(,"SITTING HERE, AFTER SPENDING 16 HRS EDITING VIDEO; 6 OF THOSE HRS. WAISTED USING ULEAD'S VIDEO-STUDIO-9, I'M UTTERLY FRUSTRATED AND SUBCONCIOUSLY MAD AS HELL! THIS WAS ONLY THE SECOND TIME I USED THIS SOFTWARE FOR A SPECIAL VID PROJECT AND ONCE AGAIN THE CAPTURE WAS ""STAGGERED & CHOPPY"" BEYOND USEABILITY!

5,Couldn`t Ask For Nothing Better,"This book is a fitness guide to getting fit and healthy... i know, sounds boring, but no. This book is not only uplifting and helpfull... but it actually tells u the cold hard truth that a teenage girl needs to know. I don`t regret, for one second, buying this book :D"
5,Good old fashion game.,"Low price, lots of boards and tile layouts to play to keep from any boredom. A typical game made a few yrs ago and still fun. Plays great on my older XP computer but it does not work properly with Windows 7, 64-bit."
1,mahjong,"You are better off getting free games online downloaded this item to pc, it only always you to open 1 game and then any other games are impossible to find !"
2,Not What I Was Looking For,"I love to play the free Mahjong game on Yahoo so I thought I would give this a try based on other reviews and the cheap price. Unfortunately this is not all it is cracked up to be. The ""3D Graphics"" are really not very good. When you play the game it is almost impossible to tell which tiles are on the raised levals. It makes it a challange just to find the tiles you can play. Also there are a large assortment of tiles to choose from but almost all of them are hard to tell which tile would match which tile because of the way the tiles are made. After a dozen or so games I am already going back to my free game of the day and removing this one from my PC. Time to look for a more user friendly version."
4,Thoughtprovoking,An interesting take on the role of television from a Catholic perspective. Fr. Poncelet provides a convincing argument for turning off the television.
3,Doesn't quite come together,"As others have noted, WE CAN BUILD YOU has two main storylines which never really mesh. Two thirds into the book, the simulacra plotline is simply dropped & the remainder focuses on Louis Rosen's mental health & his 'relationship' with Pris. While Pris is the most coherently drawn character in the book, Rosen's infatuation is rather clumsily drawn & never quite believable. In addition, Rosen makes a somewhat bland protagonist--I found myself more sympathetic to Pris, even if she is a borderline sociopath.A shame the simulacra (manufactured replicas of humans) plotline is abandoned, as it had real potential. In particular, the Edwin M. Stanton simulacrum was a fascinating character (more so than the Lincoln, as it doesn't come with our own preconceptions)--Dick could have taken that character & run with it. I might also note that Dick treats Pris rather harshly, considering this is a mentally ill 18-year-old girl. Hence my sympathy leaning toward her."
4,Much better than people say,"I know it's not highly regarded among Dick readers, but this book is very unique and different than the others. The dark and quite humorous dialogue between characters (especially Pris' character) coupled with the wisdom of the Lincoln and intensity of Stanton make for an interesting read. Some might complain that the story doesn't go anywhere, but I would argue that it's not that different from the tradition of putting ordinary characters in insane, yet objectively amusing situations. The interactions, the dialogue, the whole setup, is strangely hilairious and dark but done in a fresh style that doesn't render it the least bit recycled. A good read."
4,A psychedelic story of heartbreak,"The selling point in this book are the androids. What better hook to engage Dick's readers? But the heart of the story are Louis Rosen and Pris and their doomed relationship... if there is some kind of relationship at all. Exploring mood altering drugs, depression and schizophrenia, Dick's novel is like an allegory of our current Prozac-happy times."
5,Philip K. Dick - a writer,"This was the first Philip K. Dick's book I've read, and it was the best book I've EVER read. So I really recommend. This is top! Louis Rosen was a wonderful character, and relationship with Pris was interesting and touching. This is a perfect book, if you find any interest to this kind of books."
5,Dick fan's choice,"I have recently read some fifteen books from Dick's lesser known production. In general, they are not as good as the best known books (like Ubik, Valis, Man in the high castle). Oh, they still have that immense amount of original ideas and the typical Dick themes of paranoia and reality vs illusion. But they lack coherence, and the ending seldom matches the expectations set in the beginning.Not so for this book! ""We can build you"" is prime Dick. It has everything - except the fame it deserves."
2,"More Lincoln, less (aberrant) thinkin'","I'm a frequent reader of Dick's work, but this one left me feeling cheated.The novel contains many typical Dick elements: identity crises, some fascinating trivia, mental illness, his feel for workaday business, humor, and frequent twists and turns in the plot.The interesting part of the book is the ""rebirth"" of Civil War characters, and how they fit into a modern situation. Unfortunately, all that is abruptly dropped, and the last 1/3 of the book is devoted to treatment of the protagonist's mental illness.Only for die-hard Dick fans, and then if only on sale."
2,Half a great novel,"The first half of this novel is quite good. The Civil War conceit actually works, contrary to my expectations. Then, the promising plot sort of melts away, as the narrator and the author become obsessed with the object of their love, an 18-year old schizophrenic. There are Dick novels that make you want to re-write them, and this is one of them."
3,Schizophrenic Layout Plot,"I read this book because I like the movie Blade Runner and got information about PKD from Amazon.com (Thank you very much !) The first two-third of the book is exciting to read as well as philosophical in theme. You never know what is the outcome of the interaction of the 'unreal' human[Pris}, the 'real' human [Mr. Borrows}, the and the 'most real' non-human [Stanton, Lincoln}.I was surprised to see the story went flaccid all the way after Seattle meeting. Nonetheless, the story as a whole does appeal to me. It centered around schizophrenia, then, simulacrum, then schizophrenia again."
1,Disappointing for a PKD work,"I picked this book up in the hopes of reading another great story from Phillip K. Dick, but it was really disappointing. My previous favorites from him have been ""The Man in the High Castle"" and ""Through a Scanner Darkly"". This book has plot elements, but it's really not well put together or entertaining. The main characters aren't very interesting, and the love & rejection the protagonist gets from Pris is so strange, it's almost like Dick is forcing something that had happened to him into the story. Really, would not recommend this book to anyone."
1,Dick at his worst,"We Can Build You is one of PKD's weakest books. It starts in a quite interesting way, but ultimately leads nowhere. The best ideas are discarded and the end of the book concentrates in the lead character's descend into schizophrenia - and even that is not interesting in any way (unlike in some other Dick's books). Recommended only for Philip K. Dick completists."
4,Typical PKD,"This is a very typical PKD story, but I thought his voice was quite good in this in the first person. The story may not be as catchy as some of his others, and the plot is rather weak, but thematically the story is as strong as any of his other good books (Ubik, Flow my Tears, etc.) This is actually a story about schizophrenia with the simulacras thrown in as thematic plot devices."
4,Little Helpers Complete Kitchen,Very Cute and durable. We bought this kitchen set for our 1 year old and she loves it. It is on the small side so it is perfect for your younger children. Sure to be a hit.
4,cute but small,We bought this for our daughters second birthday and she does like it a lot. It is smaller than I thought it would be. I would pay the extra money and get the bigger size. It would have also been nice if Toy R Us would actually carry these items in store instead of paying an extra $35 for shipping. But all in all we like it okay.
5,Good size and fun,"I love Step 2 products as they area well-made, easy to assemble (though the kitchen didn't require any), and well thought out. This has a great telephone that rings, the look is cute, and it fit's nicely in the corner of my son's room. Now he can be a Top Chef all day long."
4,For the adult toddler,"This toy is ideal for the toddler to act like a grown up and place things in the refrigerator, microwave, oven, and dishwasher. The stove has real knobs to teach your carpet crawlers how to turn on real gas stoves (ouch). You can fill the toy with sand to make it more stable. It comes with a phone (pretty good one too). My twins love to play until one invariably tries to shut the other inside the fridge (too small with shelves, so it's safe). I had to buy plastic food and cookware elsewhere."
5,"Little Helpers Complete Compact Kitchen with Microwave oven, Dishwasher, sink, stove and Refrigerator and Phone",My husband and I got this product for our little girl for Christmas. She is 16 months old and she loves to play with it all the time. She loves playing with the phone and putting things in the refrigerator. It is the right height for her.
2,There are better kitchens,"This kitchen is ok, but there are much better kitchens out there. The biggest problem is that the oven door and dishwasher door are hinged at the bottom, not the side. It's awkward for me to open the doors, let alone my daughter. It's also small, which I liked when I was looking, but I've found that my daughter really prefers slightly larger kitchens (she likes to reach) with doors that are hinged on the side (she loves to open and close the doors). I'm going with a wood kitchen for the next version and sticking this one outside in the playhouse."
2,Will not stay closed,The doors never stay closed NEVER. Find a better kitchen set. This one is a waste of your money. The doors open down so they just fall to the floor.
2,wouldn't buy it again,"The doors on the toy (the oven and dishwasher ones specially) get stuck a bit and require extra force to open. Further, the stickers are peeling off on the edges, and this is for the brand new toy rather than after use. The toy is not that exciting (both looks and capabilities), and reading the more enthusiastic reviews I had higher expectations. I wouldn't buy it again if I had the choice."
3,Nice toy - stickers put on slopily,"Overall, this kitchen is well constructed and sturdy. Unfortunately, the stickers were all put on the white plastic very carelessly and crooked. They needed to be removed and reapplied. This was possible for all the stickers except the microwave, which ripped slightly."
1,Too small for my 2 year old.,My daughter got this kitchen for Christmas and it's still in the box. I was excited to get it because it even had a frig. When I read the box and saw that there was no assembly required I took a step back to look at the size of the box. It is way too small. I had my daughter walk past the box (she's 2) and she was taller. I want something that she can enjoy until she's about 6. This box is not going under the tree!
2,not good for twelve-year-olds,"My friend Rebecca's mom got this for her and she is 12 years old! I'm not trying to criticize your product but i think my friend is a little too old for this toy, if you know what i mean! :) However, it must be really good cause' she plays with it all day. I call her and she says, ""Sorry, best friend, I can't come over tommorow, I'm playing with my little helper's complete kitchen. Maybe another day."" And i'm just bummed about that. She even talks to the phone (a little freaky right..)I guess my point is, that this toy is very addictive. It's great for parents that need something to occupy their toddlers, but not for mature twelve-year-olds.Sorry Rebecca!Love,Kaci Hawkins"
5,Great first kitchen for toddlers,"Santa brought this kitchen for my 16 month old last Christmas and she has been playing with it almost every day ever since. This is a great first kitchen for chidren ages 1-3 although older children still enjoy playing with it when they visit. It has all of the basics, a fridge, oven, dishwasher, microwave and sink. My child has no problem opening and closing all of the doors and I haven't had any problems with the door falling open. This is a great kitchen for the little ones because even at 16 months, my daughter could reach all of the doors on the ""appliances"". Another great thing about this kitchen is that it comes in the box fully assembled! That's something of a rarity these days with large children's toys. If I have one complaint, it's that the faucet doesn't move, so my daughter can't pretend to turn on and off the water. But that's a small drawback considering all of the other pros."
3,"Nice and Sturdy, but Small","This item is made out of sturdy, thick plastic. No assembly required (the stickers are even already on). It has all the appliances you could want in a kitchen--fridge, dishwasher, oven, microwave, and even a phone--with plenty of storage space for dishes and play food. However, it does not come with any accessories. Also, the sink handle does not move (so baby can't pretend to turn it off or on), and sink does not have a removable basin. The electronic phone (with sounds) is a nice feature, and was a major selling point in my decision to purchase this item. Please be aware that this item is for SMALL children. My daughter is not even 2 (and average height) and it is just right for her now, so she will probably outgrow it in a year or two. The height is actually just over 30 inches (this site shows it as over 36 inches, but I think the height and width must be reversed). Overall, a solid product, but I was disappointed in the size."
5,The best toy I have ever bought!,I bought this for my daughter when she was 3 after her 1st kitchen fell apart (different brand). She played with this almost every day for a year. She now is almost 6 and still plays with it and my son who is 2 plays with it all the time. The doors still work (even after being stood on) and the cute little phone still works! I recommend this to anyone who has a 2-6 year old girl or boy. Oh - it's easy to clean too!
4,Great basic kitchen toy,My daughter has loved this kitchen since since her first birthday. I wish every toy manufacturer built their toys with these same quality standards. Four years later it is still played with.
4,Nice starter kitchen set,"This is a nice little kitchen that came fully assembled and ready to go out of the box. I was disappointed that it didn't come with any accessories other than the phone and the oven door has a tendency to fall open occasionally if you accidentally bump it. Nothing dangerous, just slightly annoying since we had it in a high traffic area. My daughter likes playing with it and it seems very durable. It is also surprisingly space saving so I don't mind having it out."
5,"Great kitchen, buy elsewhere","I bought this kitchen when my daughter was 16-months-old. She just turned four, and uses it constantly.But I couldn't believe when I saw the price tag of $260 on here! Is that a misprint? I bought it for $90 new. Insane."
4,My daughter loves it,"My daughter is 17 months and she loves it. However, she was annoyed in the beginning that the fridge doesn't close completely. Moreover, it is hard for her to open the stove and the dishwasher. We also bought a small, electronic microwave for $10 at Toys'r us and we installed it at the kitchen's window. Now it is a big hit for her. She plays with it non-stop. She loves the telephone, big fridge and the new microwave. We also bought her some pots and pans because the set doesn't come with any. The kitchen is her size now and I definitely recommend it for toddlers up to 3 years."
3,"Nice sturdy kitchen, but no accessories!","My daughter just received the kitchen as a Christmas present. When we opened the box and removed the kitchen, we were suprised to see it didn't have any dishes, pots, pans, anything except a removable phone. The kitchen however is all one piece and extremely durable. Just buy some accessories along with it so your child has something to play with! My daughter showed no interest in the kitchen until see had some pots and pans, etc."
4,Great kitchen!,My twin daughters got one of these kitchens for Christmas! They love this kitchen. It is not as tall as some of the others on the market which is a feature that I love!! My girls play with this all of the time and it is small enough that I have it set up in the kitchen so that they can pretend that they are cooking while I make dinner. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a kitchen for a toddler. IT is well built and stays clean.
4,Good overview of the field,The chapters in this book are written by some of the most influential emotion researchers of the last decennia. Different angles are presented throughout the sections. As such it is a good addition to psychology researchers who want to have an overview of the field.
2,Too sweet for me,"The first half of this film was engaging - good cinematography, great scenery and some promising characters confronting real issues. Then it went a little weird - not weird interesting & challenging but weird saccharine & implausible. This film is obviously a hit with some, but is far too sweet for my taste."
3,Alice in Wonderland,"What a wonderfully smarmy sappy tale. Let's see, the main character works hard for 20 years to become an artist who mainly paints bad pictures of star constellations, then gives up attending the opening of his first show, presumably of more bad paintings of constellations, runs home to see Grandpa who's had a stroke (not always a life threatening happening...he could have waited a day) only to run into a passle of heterosexuals who have better gaydar than I do and ends up in love with some guy who is positive that the fastest way to a man's heart is through his stomach. Other than all the good old boys who, in real life, would be gunning for the homos instead of helping them poach a fish and the old biddy that would normally be spreading nasty stories about their bedroom habits instead of hosting smart soirees where we can all meet and greet, it wasn't a bad movie. I know I cried at the end. A little. A very little."
2,Did I miss something?,"I'm glad to see that so many seem to have enjoyed the film, but it honestly left me confused and wondering what I had missed. The plot really didn't make sense. Big Eden left me with a feeling similar to when to friends try to tell you about something they both know, but leave out all the important details you need to hear to 'get it'. The main character is rude to his friends, his family, and everyone who approaches him from the very first scene and you end up not caring for him as a viewer. The city he finds himself in is bent on playing matchmaker and keeping him there, but it all seems very unrealistic and your mind fights against it the whole time. The ending is predictable and takes forever to play out. All in all, the only thing I really liked about it was that it was gay-themed. If this had been a straight flick I don't think I would have even finished it."
2,I'm sold,"I take back my reservations about Big Eden after watching extras on DVD. At its heart, the director says, the movie tells us that take away hate and bigotry and life is still difficult.Henry Hill is a successful but unhappy NYC artist who returns to his Montana home after his grandfather has a stroke. While coming to terms with a high school friend, Dean, who he's secretly loved for 18 years, he finds a surprising new love."
5,Best gay movie ever!,"I have to say that this was one of the most enjoyable, touching movies I've seen. It's refreshing to see a gay- themed movie whose plot doesn't revolve around sex and betrayal for a change. Now if I can only find out where this town of ""Eden"" is!"
5,"Solid, Heartwarming, a Miracle","This is a little miracle of a movie. It grew on me with each passing day since I first saw it, and I ended up seeing it two more times. I now consider it one of my all-time favorite films. I can't wait to own the DVD."
4,A break in the Tradition,"I started this movie with the expectations that I have come to accept with all gay-themed movies -- one or all of the main characters will die before the movie is over. And usually, that death will be gay-related (AIDS, homophobic violence, etc). While there was one death in the movie, that was expected and was of one of the supporting characters, not the protagonist. So, even though the story is a little weak and the plot totally predictable, a good, wholesome gay love story was nice to watch. I would recommend this as a date movie (as it has been described) or just an ""I'm alone on a rainy Saturday afternoon"" movie."
5,You'd better believe it's a nice dream!,"As hokey as it sounds, if you don't ever dream, if you don't ever try, you'll never know.Even 1000 miles from nowhere.See this film... Then, see it again and bring a friend... Then, ask them to do the same.It's that good.Every single person associated with this film - if you guys ever come onto Amazon and read stuff like this - thank you.Best,"
4,"If you have ever loved, you have to see this movie","This has got to be THE movie dealing with typical man-to-man love relationships. The characters are played wonderfully and in-depth. You have a warm, good feeling when the movie is over, and most movie goers were clapping at the end in the theater where I saw the movie. Although the town of Big Eden (in Montana, no less) seems at bit too far-fetched, it leaves you hoping that somewhere a town of loving, connected, and caring people like the people of Big Eden exists. The scenery itself is simply stunning - as well as the actors and the acting!"
5,A story as lovely as the scenery,"This is a lovely movie, using the incredible beauty of Northwest Montana as a counterpoint to the difficulties of love. It denies the stereotypes (am never sure how to spell that word!) of residents of small towns. Rather than the expected disdain of gay romance, the town folks serve as a greek chorus seeing love and opportunity where the leads see pain and loss.I was shocked to see how negative some of the reviews here are, as I just enjoyed the ride of the movie. Think of it as floating a river in a raft, never whitewater, but some quick currents and some slow. Each has their purpose and pleasure."
1,~UNREALISTIC and BORING~,"All these people mingling in the Life of just one guy ""Henry"" so Unrealistic and Boring as they followed him around through this beautiful Town, Partying with him and Cooking for him ...oh Yes! they do that a lot, the Movie drags on and on and on ...until finally ""Henry"" realizes who was doing most of the Cooking! ...I was so relieved when it ended ...and also very Hungry! ...Thank You"
5,a very enjoyable movie,"I loved this movie and have recommended it to quite a few friends; all of which enjoyed it as well. As movies with gay themes go, this is a treat. You won't be disappointed."
4,This film takes me beyond,"First of all, I'm not gay. I didn't know it was categorized as a ""gay movie,"" and I don't care. This is a very well written, directed, performed, photographed, and edited piece of film. The fact that Henry being gay is as naturally beautiful as the lakes and mountains portrayed in the movie. Aren't we all looking for a place like this? I'm not gay, but I'm a guy in 40s. The life is wanting to be simpler, and this movie is a nice reminder to go beyond what we are caught up with."
2,Fantasy Land !!,"There is absolutely no way that this depiction of the gay scene in Montana is somehow linked to reality. If you can overcome this huge obstacle you might enjoy this movie. Then again, you have the other unrealistic scenario where 2 men (one of them divorced and gorgeous) are trying to win the affection of an annoying, ugly Arye Gross (name suits him). Never would happen! The scenery shown in Montana is stunning, and the portrayals of his grandfather and close friend (woman teacher) are sweet but cannot save this far fetched drama. This movie had potential but a different cast and a dash of reality were needed to give this one a chance. Rent this one at best."
3,Big Eden? Not in Montana.,"I think ""Big Eden"" easily merits a five star rating in most respects. The film's acting, direction and especially casting are excellent. But I have to take a few stars away for its storyline, which is a confusing mix of believable fiction and nonsensical fantasy -- a mix that will appeal far more to some audiences than others. I've never been to any small town (let alone one in Montana) where the entire community seemed to have nothing else to do except matchmake gay couples. The absurdity of this premise detracted greatly from what I think is an otherwise outstanding film.Tom Bezucha's story would have easily stood on its own, without the introduction of this absurd fantasy. We got proof of that claim five years later, in a film called ""Brokeback Mountain"". ""Big Eden"" is the same basic story, only far less dramatic and with a much happier ending. Compare Jack Twist to Henry Hart, and Ennis Del Mar to Dean Stewart."
4,"Nice film, but I'd think twice about the DVD","The plot is simple, but the execution is lovely: a middle-aged gay man returns to a small town in the Northwest, in order to help his ailing father. His reception in the town is surprising, but that's best left to the viewer to discover. The hero is deeply closeted within Big Eden, so much so that the film seems a little unduly bland on this score. Love interest centers on his high school flame, now a somewhat unhappily married man; and on an extremely shy Native American. This is a very enjoyable, if somewhat idyllic, movie, and the praise it has received is fully justified. On the other hand, the movie is not really up to the lavish treatment of this DVD, which pulls out all the bells and whistles normally reserved for major films. I'd rent instead."
5,Big Eden has a great big heart!,"Simply a great love story in the unexpected setting of a small town in Montana. Characters are wonderfully drawn and complex without becoming self-consciously so. Several gratifying plot twists, many lovable characters, and a tremendous amount of love shown between members of the community. It's a great way to spend a couple of hours."
2,Not what I expected,"I'm having trouble understanding all the rave reviews on this one. I'm very happy that films like this one can be made but they just haven't gotten it right yet.I expected MUCH more from this movie after reading the synopsis on it's official website. It dragged in more than a few places (the opening scene, Henry and Grandpa on the porch, Pike preparing countless meals) and left me dry in the end. The Henry/Pike thing didn't work for me at all. It felt very forced.I found myself feeling VERY sorry for Dean in the end. He was never quite honest with himself and ended up settling for something he didn't really want.Overall this film didn't end up being the idealistic fairy tale that it professes to be."
3,But It's a Nice Dream,"Big Eden has its heart in the right place, and writer/director Thomas Bezucha is a filmmaker to watch out for. As someone who has lived in the big city and the big nowhere, however, I gotta say this movie's depiction of middle America and human nature in general is a pure Pollyanna fantasy, which always keeps the movie's credibility somewhat questionable. Maybe they should haved called it Montana As Seen Through an Eddie Bauer Catalogue or An Upper West Side New York Worldview Goes on Vacation. Subtle character interaction from the uniformly excellent cast and a few scenes of honest emotional confrontation (especially between the hero and old high school flame) do make this worth a look. N.B.: that art would NEVER end up in the Whitney!"
2,Big Disappointment,"I have seen many gay films and grown tired of seeing the same old themes hashed out (nasty queens, AIDS, self hatred), so I was excited to hear that Big Eden is something different. True it is a sweet fable about unrequited love and the importance of family. And as a fable, I can go along with its unrealistic tone. However, the two lead characters have almost zero chemistry going on. I think the director was so involved in making an ""endearing"" ""sweet"" story that he forgot to provide any good reason that these two men would ever be compatible or fall in love with each other..."
3,Nice Story but No Closed-Captioning for the Deaf,"I love watching movies like this but I was disappointed when I found out that it didn't have caption or sub-title for the deaf and hard-of-hearing audience. So naturally I had to do a lot of guessing when I watched the story unfold, but still...I was missing a lot when I couldn't understand the dialogue. So just beware."
1,Big Eden,"Not enough of a movie about much. There seems always to be the threat that something might engage the audience, the actors by in large are fine, but the director and or the editors mismanage and the piece is no Citizen Kane, or Three Men and a Baby either. Why waste your time with unsatifying, unreal, and boring?"
2,Poor,"Movie is not very professional. However, story idea is great, but producer cut too many scenes and there is a lot of things was strange and I can't understand why this happens.I will not recommend it to anyone..."
5,"""Wishes"" Do Come True....","This Movie Is The Best Movie I Have Seen In Ages!! I Bought The DVD Because Of The Great Reviews Here, I Am So Happy I Did!!! I Watch It At Least Twice A Week Or More! The Cast Is Magical, The Setting Beautiful & The Story Is Moving, Sweet, Touching & Real!! Not That Everything About The Movie Is Realistic, But The Loving & Longing Are So True It Hurts!!! The Music Used In The Film Is GREAT!! So Do Yourself A Favor And BUY IT NOW!!! Wishes Do Come True & The People Envolved In This Movie Made Mine Come True With This Magical Movie!!! Now If They Would Just Release A Soundtrack!!! hint hint!!! Please Enjoy This Movie, I Know I Will For Years To Come!!!"
4,a nice suprise,"It was great to finally find a movie with a gay theme that I would not be ashamed to watch with my niece and my grandmother....Completely unbelievable, yet thoroughly enjoyable. A gay film without sex, dance music, drugs- suprisingly more interesting than any movie I've seen in a long time."
4,One to watch more than once.,"A Charming tale of a small town with a big heart! I watched the movie once and honestly didnt realy understand it, i didnt get what everyone had been talking about, THEN i watched it again, and was blown away!!!!This film is completly charming and georgeeous! The actors are brilliant and the overall feel of the film as non thretening and calm, it moves slowly through the lives of the people in the small town, bringing you into all of these peoples lives, and you get to know them all, and you never want to leave!"
5,This is not a Gay movie,"This movie is a story about the support of family and friends in a small town. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll fall in love with each unique character represented in the town of Big Eden. And yes there is a love story between two men. But instead of two men, you see two people who were once lonely find hope and happiness."
4,Big,Saw movie on Logo and desired to have it in my library. A very moving gay movie and the out come was a tear jerker. Acting was superb as were the actors.
4,"Interesting Perspective, Slightly Fluffy, Yet Enjoyable","It was fantastic to see the stereotypical gay landscape change for once. ""Big Eden"" is a wonderful affirmation that gay life does, in fact, exist outside of a few big cities. Yes, gay people exist without clubs and leather or whatever else the rest of those movies must imply. The mood of the film is comfortable, which is what you feel from watching the people of this small town, who are quite accepting, contrary to skewed perceptions about those places after the Matt Sheppard event. Henry Hart is a loveable character, but my favorite is Pike, the shy guy who tries to win Henry's heart by cooking up delicious meals for him (secretly) and that angle is just kind of, well, beautiful. So in other words, it's a feel-good, funny movie which dispels some horrible myths that people in the Mid-West or Mountain state are just a bunch of ""narrow-minded, ignorant rednecks."""
5,Smalltown Wonderful,"This film goes straight to the heart and you melt. This movie has the potential to help break down phobia's. If we could all understand that what we are looking for is usually right in front of us. I loved the story line, the beauty of the area they choose for the filming and the characters. The performances were great and you felt like you were in Big Eden. Loved it one of the best in a long time. I can not wait for the director/writers future projects. Keep the love flowing."
4,cookin up a storm in Montana,"I loved the idea of this film. However, I must acknowledge the struggle that many gay people I know have undergone, and in doing so I find the townfolks' attitudes in this movie a little too unbelievable. I have had friends from small towns in rural America who have come out of the closet as gay, and they have been disowned by their parents and treated poorly by the entire town. If only the world could be this way! until it is, one can only dream about such a town as Big Eden."
5,cabusman,"Joe Orton was definitely a man who rowed against the flow. For many years his ongoing relationship with Kenneth Halliwell was mutually beneficial but ultimately destructive.It was plain that Joe lived for anonymous sex in London but his endless flow of underage sexual encounters when in Morocco, among other exotic locations, was his downfall.Above all was Joe's ability to describe, with indifference, many of these conquests. This endears his otherwise rather noncommittal character to all who read this book, mixing the ordinary with the shocking.Highly recommended."
5,Great brush for 223 rounds!,This RCBS brush is very good quality and very much needed forcleaning 223 cases or what ever 22 to 25 cal size case you have.RCBS is a very high quality company! I have the awesome RCBSRock Chucker press and a bunch of their equipment. You will bevery happy!
2,a so so,I bought this book and read it for several times so far. the book is badly organized and very wordy. the illustrations are overdone. but the content seem right for med students.
3,Dimensions?,"The dimensions listed don't make sense (approximately 39x2x2 inches). Does anybody know the correct dimensions? I looked at various other websites that sell or otherwise discuss this map, but if they list the dimensions, they are similar to these. I'm hoping somebody who already has it will get out a measuring tape and let us know.thanks!"
5,Great multiple-use pan,I consider this my 'go to' pan for many recipes. We're a small family and this pan is the perfect size for many meals. I've used it mostly on the stovetop and like the fact that it has two handles. I clean it with Barkeepers Friend and only hand wash. So far I have no complaints and am happy I added this pan to my basic pieces.
5,Nice Pan! Just the lid is $69 on Cuisinart website!,"I needed the 12"" lid for my set so I just purchased this instead since it comes with the lid which sells for $69 on the Cuisinart website."
5,Excellent casserole; excellent value,"This casserole is well-made; very heavy; shiny as a mirror when it arrived. (I'm sure that will change a bit over time. :)) It's perfect for what I wanted: something that can go from stovetop to oven, as the handles are oven-safe. It was a deal of the day on Amazon, and that made it a terrific value, too. I am very happy with this purchase."
5,Cuisinart Utensils,What more can you say. You get what you pay for. These pots and pans are excellent and are very easy to handle. You will not be dissapointed.
2,Buy it for $69 at ctleryandmore.com,"Amazon keeps changing the price and 2 days after my order was placed they won't credit a lower rice. Fine, I can return it with the stockpot and save $35 from cutleryandmore.com. Even dept stores credit or match lower prices. http://www.cutleryandmore.com/cuisinart-multiclad-pro/stainless-steel-round-casserole-p111042"
1,What I received is what Della Casa is... who knows!!!,"I sent the so-called seller ""Della Casa"" an e-mail through Amazon com after receiving the ordered product... it didn't come in ""It's original Box""(bubble wrapped in a card board container) nothing to register the product as Cuisinart requires or any thing about the product as to cleaning or use. Cuisinart didn't except a registration without the OFFICIAL model number and UPC bar code. Della Casa would not answer my request for this information. The product appears to be less than what was said it was- ""Pro-tri-clad "" I would not buy from this supplier in the future. All other Pro-tri-clad cook ware from Amazon Com was what it said it was, heavy gauge Pro-cookware. When someone sends you a lesser product then they won't respond, and that's what DELLA CASA does... say one thing and deliver something else. Never again- DELLA CASA!!!"
2,Keeps warping,"This is overall been an ok pot. Been using it close to a year. I have a flat top electric range. The original pot I ordered warped directly in the middle. When placed on a float surface, it would wobble. I sent it back at my expense and had another sent to me. This one has also done the same thing. In my opinion the bottom is just not as thick as it needs to be. Over time of using it the pan get a small high spot right in the middle and wobbles a bit."
4,Good quality.,"As nice as the more expensive brands from William Sonoma. I got his one on a wonderful ""deal of the day"". I am using it in the place of a saute pan. Is is a shame it is made in China. Seared, then braised Chicken Cordon Bleu. Came out perfectly. It was very easy to clean. Followed the directions- filled with warm soapy water, then wiped it with a sponge. Then used some ""Bar Keepers Friend"" to shine it back as good as new. I will slowly add more from this collection as the need arises."
5,Works Well with Calphalon Glass Lid,"The only regret I had ordering this product was the lack of a glass lid. Once it arrived, I found that the 9.5"" glass lid for the Calphalon stainless steel omelet pan fit nearly perfectly.This casserole pan cooks evenly and is just the right size, especially with the glass lid."
5,love this,I have used this so much since I got it. The high sides protect from spillage and splashing and it goes from stove to oven to table. I had cut down on cooking and realized I didn't have good cookware so I purchased this. I love to use it!
4,Good book,Book has good information but some of it is outdated as the data is from the late 80's early 90's.
1,Dated Material,"The items covered in the book are basic and need to be discussed. However, the sample items and some tables used show data from 1988. This info is not useful."
3,This one didn't capture me,"My mind kept wandering and I had to force myself to finish.Tom Ford couldn't make his payment to Lili Marino for a writing job she had done for him so she agreed to take his cottage in Walden Corners, N.Y. as payment. What does Lili know about country living? Very little, but she knows even less about solving the murder of Coach Johnson who she finds floating in a pond during the first day of hunting season.Coachs' family, wife Nora and son Scooter, were the first family to accept Lili into their small town so she feels that she owes them. Unprepared for the rivalries and animosity in a small town Lili is quickly in over her head in trying to solve this murder, but thankfully she has her gourd art to keep her centered.In this debut novel Bruce tries too hard to add too much to the plot; it would have been much better if she simplified and reduced the number of characters. I don't think I will continue with the author."
3,Quick seller response,"I purchased this for my sister who is a personal chef. She currently uses a basic excel spreadsheet and Word to keep her recipes and ingredient lists, etc. I recieved a scuffed DVD case with a BLURRY picture on the label that was halfway wrapped in cellophane. CLEARLY BOOTLEG, or else very cheaply done. The software might be great, but I couldn't get past the package.Seller contacted me and refunded my money and sent a new one which looked better. I will fully edit this post when my sister opens and uses the software. The seller's had a quick response to my issue.I purchase a lot from Amazon and have never had an issue until this."
5,Like it so far,"Haven't used the software very much, but is easy to load and use so far. I hope to utilize it a lot in the future."
1,DONT BUY THIS CD!!!!,First off i had bought 2 albums cause i thought i had scratch the 1st one.Well i was wrong they both had scratchs on both tracks 3 and 9. I wished i had read the reviews alot closer ( which i will from now on) i would not had bought it. To those who gave it a good reviews i would loved.... no wished u would name the ablums/cds that u had gave a 4-5 stars aleast it would give others choices on which to buy and not to buy.Sadly i had loved the music but just couldnt bear listening to the scratchs.
4,A Well Known Christmas Favorite,"Percy Faith's MUSIC OF CHRISTMAS contains familiar holiday music in traditional arrangements. Since the recording has been around for many years and has had wide radio play and is sometimes heard in department stores and elevators, people are probably familiar with some of the tracks without even realizing it. There are a few notable arrangements. ""The Holy and the Ivy/Wassail Song arrangement uses a less familiar version of ""The Holly and the Ivy"" and the arrangement of ""Deck the Halls"" could almost be called ""Fantasia of Deck the Halls."" Each of the tracks has that certain Percy Faith sound, made famous by his rendition of the theme from ""A Summer Place.""This is the perfect instant Christmas spirit recording. Usually I listen to it in early December when things begin to get busy and I need to get in the spirit. These older familiar renditions of the holiday music we all love."
3,Warning: this import CD was burned from a record!,"I love Percy Faith's ""Music Of Christmas"" and long for a proper remastered version. So I occasionally buy imports in the vain hope that someone overseas has done what Columbia won't do domestically. Unfortunately, this British import was clearly lifted from someone's vinyl - with a few snaps, crackles and pops - and one near-skip. Oddly enough, it may have a better dynamic range than the current American version. Go figure."
1,Defective CD,"This is the worst sounding CD I have ever purchased. Somebody definately screwed up in the remastering process. It has loud hiss, channels out of balance, and muffled sound. Pay close attention to the first part of Good King Wenceslas. Hopefully this CD will be correctly remastered and then reissued because it is a great Christmas album worthy of being done right."
4,I'm so happy to finally find this CD!,"I have been looking for this CD for years since my tape wore out. I love the way Percy puts his heart in my favorite Christmas songs. The CD quality couldn't be better. If you like instrumental Christmas music, you will love this one. I do!"
5,Peaceful christmas music,This cd is beautifully orchestrated for the sounds of christmas. This cd evenly flows the wonderful christmas carols and is very relaxing to listen to. Highly recommended if you like strings. These songs are nicely done and make the christmas season special so that you want to play it all the time.
4,Good variety,"I bought this for a friend to lives in another state who loves dark chocolate. He said that all of the chocolates were very good, and that they all tasted very different from one another."
2,"Not ""wowed"" by it","I bought this for my wife who loves dark chocolate and she disliked it. In fact, she gave them back to me to eat saying they weren't worth the calories. It's a cute package, but not worth the $."
3,good resource,"good resource, very much encyclopedic, some outstanding authors, could benefit with color photos"
1,I wonder?,"I wonder what this product would have been like? Unfortunately, they keep sending the wrong item and swearing it's the correct one. Anyway, I guess we'll just look elsewhere for it and see if they have the same wrong product!!"
3,Well.......... I guess its okay,"Well to be honest its kind of well, weird. Its cute but they really just have a bunch of their favorite songs from the Adventures of Mary-Kate and Ashley and Your Invited to Mary-Kate and Ashleys video series. Their jokes aren't the best either. Their are a few okay and good songs but its not like their other videos."
3,Looks good upon delivery.,"The pullover arrived packed well in a sturdy envelope and in good condition. The delivery took quite a bit longer than expected, but at least the item looked the same as the photo."
3,Nice product EXCEPT,"Very nice product but I have 2 things I HATE about it. One is that at night the light button only activates the light for about 10 seconds, then it goes black which requires a hand to push the button and turn the light back on.This is not fun especially when descending or ascending at night. Also the low air alert or altitude depth alert is very hard to hear. I even cut out holes in my hood and I still can not hear the alert sounds. Why have a feature that makes noise but you can not hear it. Lastely the data cable is very expensive and comes seperate. The compass comes seperate too and it does not work well. Poor lighting."
5,My daughter loves this truck!,"We say this at a toy store and my 13 month old daughter wouldn't put it down. We ended up purchasing on Amazon and she is one happy little girl. The top has a small portal that can be opened and she put toy blocks in through the hole. After that she dumps them out and starts again. The cabin also opens to allow for figures to be placed in the drivers seat. The funniest part is hearing her make ""vroom"" sounds when she pushes it around."
3,Trash Can Probs,Cute truck for my 2yr nephew. However as other reviewers indicated the green trash can is too deep and comes off as soon as the truck moves. The trash can and blocks used for trash eventually got thrown across the room in frustration by a normally content little boy. Since toddlers like to do everything themselves and their own way having a truck that will never work properly by design can prove to be a waste of money.
2,Not for outdoor use!,"If you are thinking about letting your child use this truck outside, then buyer beware...do NOT purchase. My son took this truck out to his sandbox and within 5 min. all the various parts were jammed and unable to operate. We cleaned it up and let him play with it in the mulch only, and the same thing pretty much happened. It is strickly an indoor toy and cannot handle dirt getting into its working parts."
3,Bruder Roadmax Garbage Truck,"I expect a new toy to come new. The top of the truck was scratched and the box was all torn up. For a $35 truck it should be brand new. I would not purchase from this toy store again, nor go through Amazon to source a product."
3,Review of Garbage truck,The truck was bright and pretty much like a real garbage truck but thelock holding the top of the truck down was very weak and the whole thing cameup when the child tried to dump the trash.
1,Expensive rubbish,"This is probably, next to Terraine's biography, the worst revisionist nonsense on that incompetent, Douglas Haig. In it, Haig's idiotic human wave assaults are said to be the only sensible tactics, his staying miles behind the front as the only sensible way to conduct war, and his intrigues as fot the greater good.Pure, unadulterated crap."
1,Only for the true complete idiot.,"If you truly are a complete idiot, then this is the book for you. Half the book is dedicated to things that you should already know if you have decided to start your own business: ""What kind of business do I want?"" Wouldn't you already have that in mind before buying the book? There is little or no information regarding important matters like scouting locations, government regulations, advertising strategies, etc.If you don't know whether or not you want to start your own business, then this book might help, but if you need a guide on how to get started, look elsewhere."
5,Useful and easy to understand,"I am using this book to help my friend's painting business get organized and focused. Bids and jobs take up much of his time, so this is a great tool to understand some of the ""bigger"" picture without having to take a bunch of business classes. The CD also has useful general forms."
1,Idiot's Guide to Starting a Lemonade Stand.,"This book is more for a high school report then someone who is starting a business. Anyone starting a business knows that you are burning the candle at both ends trying to put it all together. When you start a business you make a few mistakes, right? Well mine was buying this book. Please don't make the same mistake. The book was remedial and I was looking for something with more substance. Great for someone looking to start their own lemonade stand!!!!!"
1,Laguiole Olive Wood Waiter style Corkscrew,"We purchased many of these as gifts thinking that this would be a great idea. Unfortunately like the other raters of this ""overpriced"" French Corkscrew.... we got screwed! After very limited use, 1-4 bottles of wine per month the corkscrew failed us after 1 year. The cork screw portion came off in the cork! This was of course while we had visitors over.We can't find any lifetime warranty or any means of exchanging or replace this item. Don't buy it!"
4,Very handy,"I am very glad I have this book. For some, the most important part will be to help find modern ways of celebrating their pregnancy within a Jewish context. For others, it's a way to link in with traditions that people hardly discuss or even know about anymore. A good book for an age in which we no longer have much folk wisdom passed down within families."
3,"The Album is an A+, the DVD is a C","Ok, Ms. Bartoli is a splendid vocalist with TRUE PASSION. The album ""SACRAFICIUM"" is a true artistic stunner, with premiere recordings, deep research and passion. The DVD looks like it was shot over a period of two days, before & after a performance, on the grounds of a Palace. Ms. Bartoli over-exaggerates every possible movement and facial expression and it is not nearly as enjoyable watching her as it is listening to her."
5,Exploring a New Lincoln Area,"Mr. Mansch's book focused on an area of Lincoln's life that heretofore, to my knowledge, had not been fully explored. Namely, the four month period between Lincoln's election and when he actually took office.The country was in such turmoil and the outgoing president, James Buchanan, could not wait to leave the White House. He was the very definition of a ""lame duck"" president. To acquaint as many Americans as possible to himself, Lincoln took a long train trip from Springfield to Washington DC. Mr. Mansch's book covers every word of every speech he gave on the trip plus gives details of the many stops he and his family made. I thought it was a great book and I was sorry when it ended. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the Civil War, in Lincoln or is a ""presidentphobe"".Bruce Fuglei"
4,Bargello quilting basics bible,"Marge Edie's ""Bargello Quilts"" is a great book for those wishing to experiment with the technique of bargello quilting. Clear, concise instructions in the basics, plus a number of innovative methods of combining and re-organizing the design strips, make bargello quilting accessible to anyone. If there are any complaints at all, it is the idea of the necessity of turning the strip sets into tubes only to have to de-construct them later. There are other books out there that have moved beyond this idea. But for beginning technique, I consider this book a must-have."
3,Lovely Quilts,"I ordered this book to get the scoop on how to make Bargello quilts. This book has some really good background and instructions but, actual patterns are few."
2,Neal Schon and Jan Hammer,"""Here to Stay"" is the first of Schon and Hammer's two albums they recorded together.Neal Schon is the guitarist of Journey,stepping outside of Journey and doing a side project with Jan Hammer.The first song on the album ""No More Lies"" is an excellent song, but the remainder of the album is filled with pleasant but boring songs like Don't Stay Away, Long Time, and Time Again.Neal Schon and Jan Hammer are both very talented musicains,and should be heard else where instead of here. I would only recommend this if you can find a cheap cassette or LP copy of the album at a low price."
2,WERE YOU IN MY BATHROOM?,"Teddy (Richard Tyson) is a female serial killer and amateur organ harvester (We all need a hobby.) Nick Ferguson (Rhett Giles) is a detective who goes it alone against Teddy and gets a hypodermic in the heart (and later a new heart). As Nick recovers he has nightmares of dead girls in his bathroom. A card carrying psychic (Miranda Kwok) he meets at a bar tells him to use the visions to find the killer.Nick looks for the killer by mixing alcohol with Prozac. His personal demons take up a lot of film. Steven Williams who was trooper in ""The Blues Brothers"" is now the police captain over Nick and reminds me of a younger thin Danny Glover. The movie ends with an interesting twist that wasn't enough to save it. After Keesha Smith shows us her wares in the first few minutes, the move goes downhill. Too much time was spent on the detective and not enough on the killer.F-bomb, nudity (Keesha Smith from Big Brother)"
2,a gift,I have never seen this movie. It was purchased as a gift. The person I bought it for likes it I guess.
1,cute but very stupid and pathetic,This movie is ok for people no older than 6 years old. I mean the babies were cute but there was just no plot and the story was completely pathetic. i saw it with my little sister and she loved it but to me it was just boring and dumb!!
3,supercool,"babygeniuses was so cool. expecially kahuna, he was the best i think he is a great actor when i first saw the movie it looked boring to me but then it got better because kahuna made it so realistic."
1,The LOOOOONG awaited sequel. DIE already ! ! !,"Bob Clark, what were you thinking? You used to have so muchtalent and now you are wasting your time with this. I hope themoney was good."
2,Fine for Four Year Olds,"Painful to watch if you are the parent or grandparent, but my 4 year old grandson adored it. He identified with all the babies and clearly thought he could be the Kahuna. He watched it 4 times this weekend. I suspect it would seem incredibly stupid to any child much older than 6."
1,I haven't even seen the whole thing and I hate it.,"Okay, first off, why make a sequel to one of the worst films of all time?Second, why pull an E.T. and remove the guns from the movie?Third, why even consider greenlighting this film?I rest my case."
1,como se llama?,"hello there world. why oh why must we make the poor llama suffer? what did this poor llama ever do to deserve such a cruel fate? this reminds me of a stuffed pet monkey i had once, long, long ago. i was just a child then. i was from a poor family, but everybuddy did the best they could. i remember having to walk uphill, barefoot through thorny rosebushes, and snow to get to school. during my hardships my stuffed monkey, harold, comforted me to no end. i liked my monkey harold. i liked him a lot.i need to go floss my teeth now. please leave the llamas bee.thank you for your attention to this matter.bye-bye world."
5,"If you love the Navy SEALs, you gotta read it!",It is a very well written book that takes a good look at the SEALs in Vietnam. It is very detailed and makes you think you were really in these situations.
5,"Wonderfully romantic, with a touch of suspense!","With Janet's new ""Calder"" books out, I wanted to reread the first three of this series. I just finished reading ""This Calder Sky"" for the third time since it was first written in 1981. There is only one author that I have liked enough to keep their books and Janet is the one. I still have all the original books of hers that I have read. This third time around, I found this book to be as entertaining as it was the first time I read it. I can't wait to get started on the second and third books of this series so that I can purchase the new one and begin reading it. Romance in a ranch/western setting is your specialty - so please keep them coming!"
3,A Standard Book on Salads,"The outstanding feature of this book is the numerous beautiful photographs. Aside from this, though, the book is fairly routine in terms of information and instructions. Still, it is a fun way of passing an hour or two one afternoon during the depths of the winter."
5,lovely ideas for beautiful salad gardens large and small,"Lovely ideas for unusual salad gardens like salad in a wheelbarrow or an Easter basket, lovingly photographed. A gem of a book.Havi Hoffman"
2,Not Quite What I Expected,These raisins were not really what I expected or wanted in taste. They tasted a bit off and too sweet for my liking. I guess I will be only buying organic foods from Klein's Naturals as I find the organic foods taste better and are less likely to have things like preservatives in them. I normally do buy organic but I decided to make this one exception and try these raisins out. I won't be buying these again. I will stick to their organic raw cashews and craisins.
2,"Intermittingly interesting, mostly dreary","I didn't pick up on the fact that Wanderlust was pretty much all about ho's, and it made me depressed to slog through all that commercial sex and exploitation. After a while there was a monotonous sameness to it that was even more numbing, in spite of the interesting--even occasionally profound--points scattered throughout. Overall, I found it more degrading than engaging."
3,for children,"This is a kids video!! It is cute, fun dance steps. I just wish the write up would have said that is was for children since we really can't see the cover ."
1,Vocabulary growth,Text books that are extremely used/exersices done should not be sold for it becomes useless for learning.
5,The Mountain t's rock!,"Heavy cloth. Non-fading print. quality t's with cool pics. Long reviews are for novels and epic-length movies, not t-shirts. Word."
4,Almost Awesome,"See, that's a pretty cool dragon on the shirt made even more bad by the fact that it's all in monochromatic styling. Plus the way it has it's arms (or whatever you call a dragon's appendages) up like it's just about to spring on you...I'm literally almost scared. But then I notice there is no fire coming from its mouth and I start to wonder...why is he not burning my eyebrows off? Does he have a sore throat, maybe some bronchitis or something that's keeping him from turning the snow on to vapor? Because, if that's the case, then I'll have plenty of time to take out my bow and arrow and pierce his heart. For I'll have no fire to fear!"
2,Too small and too long,"Unless you are in the NBA this shirt is way too long and yes, it does run small as another reviewer stated. What are you thinking about with this length?, how can you sell this shirt the way it is?"
5,JOE,REALLY NICE SHIRT. GREAT QUALITY. VERY PLEASED. LOOKED EXTREMELY SHARP ON MY 2 YEAR OLD GRANDSON. PUT A LONG SLEEVE WHITE TURTLE NECK UNDER T SHIRT FOR CHILLY DAYS AND CAN WEAR JUST T SHIRT WHEN WEATHER WARMS UP.
1,BEWARE! DANGER LIES WITHIN!,"I caution one and all. Please I beseech and implore you all to not, I repeat NOT wear this shirt at a renaissance festival. My good chum, Helbert, traipsed about to a ren faire wearing one of these shirts. In short time he came upon a knight at said faire whereupon he was duly smoted by the knight and his broadsword. Helbert did put up a gallant fight but alas the knights prowess was too much for old Helbert. May he rest in peace.So, I hope you all take heed of Helbert's tale of woe and if you insist on buying this shirt please refrain from wearing it near knights."
4,Nice shirt.,I bought this as a gift for my son. The fabric was good quality and the art work was great.
5,MORE MOER MORE-PLEASE,The Queen of Beale Street and the movie Cookies Fortune Mis Ruby Wilson deserves so much MORE. THis voice is begging to be listened to by a much wider audience.....id give her 10 stars if I could...go get the movie and see whay I mean.....
2,Pagis Pro 2.0,"There is probably nothing wrong with this product. It was just not compatible with my computer and was therefore unable to use it. It was all right to return it for a refund, less the shipping cost."
4,Jane Eyre,I feel that this is one of the better film presentations of this literary titles. It stays closer to the book content than any other movie about Jane Eyre that I have seen.
5,Faithful and Classic,Wonderful movie! Excellent adaptation of the classic of the orphaned teacher who fell for the seemingly cold yet altruistic Mr. Rochester. You could honestly feel the love between the two. Highly recommended!
4,Jane Eyre,"This movie was great. It was first intended for tv. I wish it did not give the credits at the beginning and end of every ""episode""."
5,Where's the DVD?!?,"I agree that this version is the most true to the book. My only problem is that I would like to purchase this film on DVD, not on VHS. So where's the uncut DVD version?"
5,A love story at it's best!,I was totally taken with this version of Jane Eyre. There is such contrast between Clarke and Dalton that makes the story so interesting. I've watched this video several times and consider it one of my favorites. If you like a good love story as well as interesting characters I recommend this video.
5,Loved it.,"I just loved this version of Jane Eyre. It was the best. I have seen many versions, but this is the best. Very well done. You will not be disappointed. Take the time and buy this version. Loved it, loved it, loved it."
1,received a defective dvd sent it back & got another defective dvd,"Just love this version of "" Jane Eyre"" but each dvd I received was defective and wouldn't play the last 11th chapter. It is so frustrating to get right to the ending and not view the outcome. I went to walmart on line and ordered the same dvd. I got it right away & the dvd was perfect. It took forever to get the dvds from Moviemars, plus had to buy mailers to send them back & ship. Unfortunately I have sent for more dvds from Moviemars and going through the long wait to get them & hope they to aren't defective. Kirbys from wilton, Me bought dvd at amazon.com"
1,An Error for Eyre,"The horrible quality of this production is a disgrace. It reminds me of when grandma watched Dark Shadows. The interior shots look like a bad soap opera. I kept praying for more exterior shots so I could see some sort of quality. If you are thinking this will be a Colin Firth Pride and Prejudice, trust me you will run SCREAMING for the nearest moor. Timothy Dalton, an outstanding actor in my opinion, loses all appeal. Even he can't overcome the tragic quality of direction, lighting, sound and set. But really who could."
5,The best version,"I have been looking for this version for quite sometime and was thrilled to find it here and for a reasonalble price. It is 311 minutes long so be prepared for a long time infront of the tv. However, you can watch it by chapters and there is only one dvd so you only have to flip it when you are ready for the next chapters. Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clark is excellent. I wish that Zelah had made more films. Enjoy if you are as much a fan of Jane Eyre as I am."
3,1983 Jane Eyre,"If you had to do a book report on Jane Eyre but didn't want to read it, this is the movie to see. Very acurate comparison with the book, but a little lacking in imagination as far as art direction goes. The acting is fair. Die-hard Jane Eyre fans would love this movie. My biggest complaint with it is the fact that, as it is a television series, there is a break every 20 minutes where the credits are given and the chapter displayed which makes it even longer. If you are looking for good cinematography, script and acting, my favorite is the 2006 Masterpiece Theatre version. It doesn't follow the book as closely, but it is a beuatifully done film."
1,"Jane Eyre (BBC, 1983)",I am hard of hearing and this video is labeled CC. However there is no way to access any closed captioning on the one I received. My player tells me that this DVD has no captioning imbedded. I had to return it as not usable for myself.
2,A Theatrical Soap Opera,"This adaptation was painful to watch. First off, it's like your watching a play not a movie. Secondly, every scene with Timothy Dalton is straight out of 1980's soap opera. It was all I could do to not laugh out loud. This version is true to the book, but with none of the passion or sentiment. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone; it was so disappointing."
3,See the Masterpiece Theatre version instead,"While the dialogue and action follows the books quite closely, I do not think that is necessarily a strength. A movie should take the best of the book, pace it right, and add strong actors. I do not feel this lived up to its potential. The recent Masterpiece Theatre version is far better."
2,"Zelah , No Jane Eyre","I've watched this adaptation many times, and am always moved by Timothy Daltons performance. Zelah Clarkes interpretation of this character is VERY ANEMIC. Very poorly cast. Mr Daltons portrayal of Mr. Rochester was excellent, he gets a full 5 stars, but unfortunately Zelah Clarkes very pale acting for a part that requires such fine tuned emotions fell very, very short of expections for those who love the book and its main character."
3,Timothy Dalton Saves This One,"I kept losing interest in this version mainly due to Clarke's portrayal of Jane...way too unemotional and bland. Dalton was very good as Rochester, a little too handsome though. Yes, this version is very true to the book but due to Clarke's performance, I felt there was absolutely no chemistry or passion between the main characters which is very important to the story. Also, the interior shots - the direction, camera work and editing seemed clumsy and were definitely lacking in quality."
2,Just OK,"This is the first production of Jane Eyre I've seen. I was rather disappointed in the story. If you like the story, the presentation itself was good. Seemed a little long and boring.Also, they said several times that the Timothy Dalton character was not a handsome man--but then they should have gotten a less handsome actor to play it.This is not a movie I will watch again and again. Maybe once every 5 years."
5,BBC Drama Jane Eyre : a must !,"Like most BBC productions of classic novels adaptations, quality is at rendez-vous in this Jane Eyre version.Compared to the VHS the DVD footage is longer by 25%.The casting is remarquable introducing tiny actress Zelah Clarke giving Jane a shy, self-effacing, sensitive and generous touch but never submissive nor resigned in her mind playing opposite tall actor Timothy Dalton giving Rochester an authoritative, imposing and unpleasantly teasing stature but often vulnerable and tormented in his heart.The slow rhythm of action emphasizes the oppressive atmosphere of the situation and lets yourself immersed in what life could be in both wealthy mansions and modest cottages of 19th century Britain northern countryside.This Jane Eyre television drama is the one I like better."
5,True to the book and moving!,I highly recommend this version of Jane Eyre. It's the closest to the book so it will make sense and is so superbly acted. Why wait!?
5,Jane Eyre (1983) is brilliant!,This version is by far the most accurate to the beloved book (which I have read 7 times) Although there are a few differences it is all around very accurate and I love the acting on both parts. This is a great buys and I highly suggest buying it!
3,Not What I Expected,"I purchased this version of Jane Eyre because I love almost anything period put out by the BBC. At first, I was under the impression that this was a movie, however it was actually a mini-series based on the novel. It was reminiscent of some of the early 80's soap operas (you'll notice this from the first scene to the last). I thought the actors were well suited for their roles, and the series was well put together, overall. I was just expecting that this would be in a movie format (such as Emma, Pride and Prejudice, etc.) and not in 13, hour long, chapters."
3,slow and expensive,this movie is slow and ridiculous to have to pay the regular Amazon fee for watching a movie at $1.99 for a half hour episode. very very slow
1,Below average adaptation,"I've watched this version a few times and tried to like it but unfortunately I can't. Some of the scenes are quite disapponting, there is so much to work with in this novel but they just don't capture anything. The 2 main actors Tim and Zelah don't in any way suit the roles they are playing, so immediately I can't warm to it. Tim acts well but isn't Rochester and Zelah is just well, strange! Even Pilot the dog seems disastrously miscast! If you want to see a true, classic adaptation of a fine novel with outstanding acting, then go no further than the 1973 version with Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack, simply outstanding in every way. I think the fact that it has been released after 30 years due to popular demand says it all! It's a complete joy to watch and proves that you don't have to cast a young, tall dark and handsome actor as Rochester to ensure that you produce a fine adaptation."
4,well done timothy,"what can i say he was brilliant i wish i could say the same about zelah clarke, she was not the idle jane. too old, jane was just 18- she look 35 if she was a day, jane was very slight- she looked 14stones in weight and i wanted to put my hand into the tv and ring her neck because she was spoiling the wonderful acting by timothy dalton, he was beyond perfect, he brought edward rochester to life for me, i started reading the book 20 yrs ago & timothy was ideal for the part.the only other fault is that it finished rather lamely ie: no kiss no smile etc"
3,I'm still waiting on the real thing.,"I have yet to experience via VHS the deep emotional, spiritual journey of the novel. I'm still waiting on the real thing."
5,The Best of all the Jane Eyre Movies!,"I read Jane Eyre in high school, and every winter since! It is a favorite book that I never tire of. I've seen the Orson Welles version- and found it dark and foreboding- other versions chop the book to pieces and do not follow the story line completely. With this version a person can practically read along in the book! I love the way the characters are portrayed from the child Jane and her companions at Lowewood school through the wonderful adult Jane and Mr. Rochester and the others throughout the book. St. John is portrayed beautifully and just as I pictured him in my teenaged mind! I love Jane's simplicity and stubbornness towards integrity and living as she wants to live. I love Mr. Rochester's brooding yet loving face and actions. A wonderful diversion whether you watch it all at once or a little at a time. A note to teenagers who want to write a book report without doing the reading..... you can watch this and do just fine! =D 5 stars all the way!"
5,Dalton is Rochester,"Timothy Dalton is great as Mr. Rochester. At first I thought he would be too handsome, but he was so into the character that his looks weren't noticeable. However I think that Zelah Clarke was not as good as Ruth Wilson (masterpiece theatre) as Jane Eyre. Still I thoroughly enjoyed it. Yes I did read the book."
4,GREAT!!!,"I saw this movie while in high school just after having read Jane Eyre. It is a great movie and I think it is worth watching over and over and over!! Timithay Dalton is just wonderfull as Mr. Rodchester, the best actor I have ever seen play the role. If you like Jane Eyre this is a must have!"
3,JANE EYRE REVIEW,"I DO LIKE THIS BOOK. ITS ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT SOMETIMES THE AUTHOR DESCRIBES THINGS MORE THAN SHE SHOULD. SHE SPENDS TOO MUCH TIME ON UNIMPORTANT AND UNINTERESTING THINGS.THE BOOK AS A WHOLE IS WORTH READING, YOU SOMETIMES JUST HAVE TO SKIM OVER EXTRA NEEDLESS DETAILS ABOUT CERTAIN SITUATIONS. SHE DOES DO A GOOD JOB IN DESCRIBING JANE'S THOUGHTS AND FEELINGS. SHE REALLY EXPRESSES HERSELF THROUGH JANE, AND MAKES JANE SEEM AS I SHE WERE REAL PERON."
1,Dont waste your time,"I have seen many 1800 movies, this is like a play not a movie. It dose not have dancing, partys, an all the rich stuff that go into it. Like these I have Buccaneers, The Duchess, Frenchmans's Creek, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall,Dangerous Beauty, One Night With the King, The Libertine w/ Johnny depp, Now these are real good 1800 hundred movies."
1,Surely you jest. What a bomb!,"Someone should inform the casting department at the BBC that a forty-year woman with bad teeth and wide hips does not look nineteen just because she's short. She resembles instead a forty-year old, wide hipped dwarf. This overlong adaptation of Jane Eyre is absolutely risible, and I challenge anyone to hum a single line of the elevator music. Look, folks, people back then had little do but read books they could barely lift; it was either that or play dominoes or charades, but that does not mean a modern adaptation should last as long as it takes actually to read the book. This turgid production is two hours too long and stupifyingly dull to boot, suggesting that the director was either paid by the hour or had to fill up two nights of programming. Stick with the elegant version starring Charlotte Gansbourg, an actress with immense sex appeal and backed up by a terrific musical score."
3,Jane Eyre DVD with Timothy Dalton,"I love this production and have awaited the DVD version for decades!!!! Unfortunately, this one kept changing formatting size throughout the entire DVD. It would glitch up and black out, then shift size back and forth throughout the display, which is particularly annoying.The production itself is stellar, independent of the POOR DVD quality."
4,Simply Amazing,"There has been some dispute over the length of time this film spends on Jane's childhood. I however found it to be an appropriate length because the book does spend at least 100 pages in it, so granted it should be 1/5 of the movie since it is 1/5 of the book. They did a very nice job capturing it, especially since it is so important in who Jane becomes. However I did think they should show the closer attachment to Jane and her friend at school and show her dying, since that is what made me cry when I read the book.I loved the movie and thought it was so great. The last hour is probably not my most favorite but I love building up in the movie and waiting over 3 hours until they finally kiss. It is after all my favorite book :)"
2,Jane Eyre 1983,"After watching the recent version of Jane Eyre presented by Masterpiece Theatre, I was hooked on everything Jane Eyre! I immediately read the book and then purchased and watched this version starring Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. After watching and immensely enjoying the Masterpiece Theatre version, this was just plain awful. It is a multiple-episode TV version in which the acting and stage settings reminded me of a soap opera. While I found it very truthful to the book, it lacked the wonderful acting, lush settings, beautiful music and cinematography of the Masterpiece Theatre version. I watched it once and probably will never watch it again. Invest in the Masterpiece Theatre version starring Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson, you won't be sorry."
3,"Dalton is great, but....","Jane Eyre is my absolute favorite book, so I've seen nearly every film adaptation of it, including this one. Timothy Dalton couldn't have been more perfect as the dark, brooding Mr. Rochester, but Zelah Clarke drove me nuts as Jane, one of the best literary heroines ever written. Clarke is WAY too old to play 18-year-old Jane, and she misses the whole idea of Jane's coming-of-age. She acts like what she is--a 25-30ish woman. She's not a terrible actress; she's just not a good fit for the character.And the look of the film itself bothers me a bit. The cinematography makes it look as though someone took his/her home camcorder and taped the whole thing from one vantage point in each room. Don't expect sweeping vistas or a rich soundtrack, but on the whole it isn't a bad adaptation."
2,Pass this up and get the latest adaptation,"I bought the Masterpiece Theatre adaptation of Jane Eyre, but it doesn't ship until later in the month. I decided to puchase the 1983 adaptation in the meantime to get my Jane Eyre fix. However, I was very disappointed in the settings and the portrayal of Jane. I thought there was no chemistry between Ms. Clarke and Timothy Dalton, and at times it was almost painful to watch the two of them together in certain scenes. I did like Timothy Dalton as Rochester, but he definitely needed another Jane to play against his Rochester."
2,This production has expired,"I was disappointed in this production of Jane Eyre. I purchased it to compare with the newer version and I found that came up short. The lighting and production values were distracting, and the actors had little chemistry."
4,amazing movie,"mr dalton and ms clark have great chemistry together.you get to see who they really are.i love the fact we see jane early abuse by a unfeeling family ,then stay at harsh braoding school that would break any child ,she become a strong loving moral compassionate woman.her heart slowly change a man who given up on ever finding happiness.this bbc production was well done.it's worth every cent i paid.it's a great rain day movie with your best girlsfriends."
5,Faithful Interpretation,"This is still the best and only really faithful film adaptation of the book, even though Timothy Dalton is really too good looking and sexy to play Rochester - oh well! (Sigh)"
3,"Excellent production, but incomplete","I absolutely adore this version of Jane Eyre. I've watched it several times on PBS, and was excited for a chance to buy a video version. However, in order to fit the program on two tapes, scenes have been ommitted from the original production. That disappointed me greatly. I'm in hopes that it will re-run on PBS again so I can have the full-blooded version."
2,My favorite Classic of all time Poorly portrayed,"I was so disappointed in the television series of Jane Eyre. Timothy Dalton is known as a great actor, but you would not be able to discern that from watching this. Jane Eyre is a book that I have read, reread, and read some more. The actors cast in this series were not the actors for the job. They turned one of the biggest romances of all time into something that I am not sure I recognized as Jane Eyre."
3,Jane Erye w/ Timothy Dalton,"I have not seen this version in a very long time. It's a little drab, but oh Timothy Dalton is great! I love that gypsy scene. It was priceless! Timothy it made this worth watching."
5,The Best Jane Eyre Version Ever!,"No film maker has ever been able to successfully bring Jane Eyre to the screen. Thank god for the BBC! The quality of this version surpasses all others and is very successful. Timothy Dalton is a great Mr. Rochester and Zelah Clarke is a terrific Jane Eyre. Other actors have done a good job, but it seemed that compressing the story and making it fit a 2 hour slot caused the story to be incomprehensible and lessened the emotional impact of the story. I was very pleased when the BBC's Jane Eyre was put on DVD and ordered it from Amazon.com as soon as it was released. I bought the video version earlier. The story is very moving and faithful in the best way to the book."
4,Jane Eyre,I have seen several versions of this movie and this one goes along with the book the best.
2,Severely Shortened Version of Mini-Series,The original UK release of this mini-series consisted of 11 30-minute episodes (330 minutes of footage) while the running time of this video is only 239 minutes. As you see the startling 1.5 hours of film were cut! Since I had a chance to see both versions I can assure you that the cuts subtract from your enjoyment of the series. And it's a shame as this is clearly the definite adoption of the Bronte's celebrated novel.
5,Very well done!,"This is my favorite make of my favorite book, Jane Eyre. This movie was really very well done. Definitely a good watch, and definitely the best make of the book I've seen so far."
3,Format Stinks,"I LOVE the VHS version of this movie and I agree that this is the best version of Jane Eyre ever made. I have been waiting for the DVD version to come out for a long time. Now having said that, I have to say I was very disappointed as I started watching it. It is broken down to 11 episodes with beginning and ending credits on each one. This is very distracting. Why did they not take the time to edit these out and present it as the VHS version does, as one movie. I have many mini series in my collection and none of them has handled going from one episode to another in this manner. Keep your VHS tape of Jane Eyre and hope that they will release another DVD with these problems fixed."
3,Jane Eyre,"This version was pretty good. It seemed like a soap opera set. I wasn't impressed with the set at all. I felt like I was watching a play. I did like how the script was very close to the book. Timothy Dalton was a wonderful Rochester. He got it right. Zelah clarke was good, I thought a little old to play the part. All in all it is good, just a little dated with the set and the filming."
3,Sorry Timothy Dalton,"This could have been one of the best versions and is quite true to the book. The only thing that keeps it from being four star is Zelah Clarke (Jane Eyre). She moves like a snail, has this down cast look and sound as if she is about to be beaten at any moment and has absolutely no expression of emotion. Even when Rochester confesses his love for her, her expression never changes. Pity."
2,Video release makes great injustice to the marvellous series,"I've seen a lot of people noticed that film is too long and certain characters are underdeveloped. I was even more disappointed than most of you with this video release since I saw ""Jane Eyre"" the way it supposed to be seen as TV series.Because you don't watch everything at once but over 1 week adaptation you don't feel that adaptation is long. The editors of this release left out huge chunks of original footage throughout the movie, especially Jane's childhood and Lockwood scenes and later at St.John's. That's why you don't see much of Jane's relationship with Helen and found that actress young Jane is somewhat lackluster though actually she was very good."
3,Good to OK,It was entertaining but not worth buying. I like time peaces and enjoy the costumes and household furnishings. Would rather see on PBS.
3,illustrations,"I purchased this DVD for my mother (a big fan of the novel) but although the actors are good it does not tell the story well , just follows it with picturesand is much more like a screen play."
1,So mis-cast,"Zelah Clark's Jane is middle-aged and looks like she's already had children. Her manner toward Rochester rings false, because she is too mature. Timothy Dalton, in addition to being too pretty, sounds and looks stilted. Yes, the dialogue is quite true to the book, but the lines sound completely unnatural. At times, I thought of skits from Saturday Night Live. Last but not least, where were BBC's legendary production values?"
3,True to the Book; Difficult to Enjoy Zelah as Jane,I watched this again as this is one of my favorite stories. This version is the most faithful to the book but I did not like Zelah as Jane; I did not feel any chemistry between her Jane and Mr. Rochester. Maybe because I saw Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens in the Masterpiece Theater version first and their chemistry was so strong and believable (in my opinion). That version (to me) was the most entertaining of the 4 versions I have in my collection.
3,It's like watching a stage production,"This version is like watching a video of a stage production. It's okay, but the Masterpiece Theatre version with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens is so much better."
3,Why Is An Actress Who Looks Like She's Between 35 To 40 Years Of Age Playing A 18 Year Old Girl?,"I agree with the previous reviewer that this was a good but not great production of Jane Eyre. Timothy Dalton was a perfect Rochester and totally believable but Zelah Clark was too old to be playing an 18 year old girl, and I think she looked a lot older than the 25-30 year age range that some reviewers are guessing at. I thought she looked more like she was between 35 and 40 years old. I'm not trying to seem like I'm being mean but Look at what looks like the start of wrinkles and crows feet under her eyes! The filming was also a little too stagy but at least Dalton was good as Rochester!"
4,Definitely worth watching!!,"This is another example of a classic period romance that is definitely worth watching. The acting was excellent. The dialogue was excellent, especially for the two main characters. This lacks the flash and cinematography of modern movies, but the story, the acting and dialogue make this an excellent choice for those who appreciate substance over style."
4,Jane Eyre,"This is, in my opinion, the best film made of the classic book, Jane Eyre. She was, in the book, a ""plain Jane"" and the actress in the film is not a raving beauty, so the producers portrayed her properly. Timothy Dalton is perfect as the master of the manor and is also the ""hottest"" actor to play that role. There is another new production out in the theaters right now and I have no interest in seeing it. Most likely will be full of special effects, a gorgeous Jane and other treats but I will stick with this film. I also don't think that paring it down to 2 or so hours does the book justice."
4,Mr. Rochester buckles my swash,"There are a zillion versions of Jane Eyre and they all fall short when compared to this one. Timothy Dalton is a swash buckling Mr. Rochester. Tall, dark and brooding. Zelah Clarke is a petite, perfect foil. I never try of this one. It's as timeless as the romance itself."
1,Dreadful book,"This book is worthless; I finished reading the first chapter, and I cannot bear to go further. It's that bad.I am an attorney, and much of what the author writes is simply wrong. There are countless times when the author misapplies the law, and his description of our legal system is unrecognisable. The author apparently thinks that basing his argument almost entirely on fictional novels and movies is a good idea. His other main source seems to be himself, but the legal system that he describes has nothing to do with the one I know. Judging by the introduction, the author's career involves civil law and writing novels, which might explain why he fumbles so badly when discussing criminal law and morality.Don't waste your time with this book. There is nothing of value within its pages."
1,The plural of anecdote is not data,"There is not much more to say than what is said by the other 1 and 2 star reviewers. The book is filled with the way Rosenbaum wishes the world could be, but is completely divorced from how the world actually is. There is no support for his arguments outside of fictional creations and conclusions drawn from anecodotal stories. Nor does he even try to explain how the world he imagines might come into being."
1,Disappointing...,"Always looking for a BIGFOOT item for my young Monster Truck enthusiast, I was psyched when I saw this...and disappointed within the first five minutes of opening it. Very cheaply made, broke almost instantaneously after slaving to put it together...never even got around to applying the stickers. Not a good choice..."
1,Sorely lacking,"If there was something less than 1 star, this would get it. It was more of a kid's video than a serious way to learn disco dances. It was extremely disappointing, with lots of kids doing the dancing, and when the instructors show the dance moves, there are many times when you can't see their feet as they do the steps. Jamie Lee Curtis and Adam Baldwin have a very minor part of this. Save your money!!!!! I just hope that Amazon.com will take this back because it is useless to me."
1,Contains Mercury and Arsenic!,Parents beware! It was recently brought to my attention that these contain high amounts of Mercury and low amounts of Arsenic. Why is Alex toy company putting this junk on store shelves for our kids to play with? This info was found on the [...] site and is listed in the Worst Toys catagory.
5,There's no other home plan catalog like this,"This plan catalog is unlike any other you'll find - it's a portfolio of designs that were originally created as custom buildings for architect James Weisman's clients. Unlike ""stock"" plans, these homes and outbuildings show the care of a good designer who listened to his customers and created unique buildings for their needs. They are also inspirational examples of how contemporary buildings can reflect the traditions of their place. The homes have balconies, lofts, lookouts, great spaces and unusual layouts that seem exciting and efficient at the same time. If you enjoy dreaming about a country home or a vacation getaway, you'll love this book."
3,Don't expect much!!,"Nicely organized book. However, does not explain all the items present in the SPSS menus.The author concentrated on the statistical part of the software, and in a very simple way. If you never used SPSS before find another book."
5,Hunter 20511 Savoy 52-inch 5-Blade Ceiling Fan,I am very satisfied with this product. In fact I purchased three of them; one for each of my bedrooms. It is quiet and circulates air very well.
5,Whisper Quiet,"As an owner and installer of many fans over the years, this Hunter fan is one of the easiest to install and is whisper quiet."
3,"""Some assembly required"" is an understatement","Hunter 20511 Savoy 52-Inch 5-Blade Ceiling Fan, Antique Pewter with Black/Cherry BladesThis product should be marketed as a KIT. Its innumerable parts required a couple of hours of assembly, and the mounting screws provided were too short.It functions well, and eventually we may forget how long it took to get the fan in place, but don't figure on taking it out of the box, putting on the blades, and installing it. It isn't rocket science, but you'll gain some experience you may not have anticipated."
5,Just made my day,"I pick out this Hunter fan on-line to place in a condo where it's much needed in San Antoio, Tx. The price was great and it really cools and circulates the A/C in the room. I'm so glad I found this."
2,Everything from China is so CHEAP...................,"My last Hunter was purchased in 1993 and has run 24/7,one of the bearings went out. This new fan was a little of a pain in the ass to install and I have done over a 200 in my life time....I bes an electrician. I doubt this one last 20 years...the old one was made in Tawain....this new one in China...It's made alot cheaper...you can see it in the materials.....gona see if I can find 2 new bearings for my old Hunter !!!!!"
4,Beautiful fan,"The color combination with the oak blades and black base are beautiful. The quality of the fan is excellent, very quiet and stable."
4,Good Product,Works the way it was described to work. Was using Audacity (very buggy and had to re-install 3x...P.I.T.A) before and this is much easier to use. Definitely a good Sound recorder/editor
1,bob the builder lacks safety sense,"i was really excited about bob the builder - i think it's a great premise! but when i watched it, i was appalled! bob follows *no* safety procedures whatsoever! this may not be a problem for city parents who want to teach their kids about the construction they see going on around them, but for rural kids, like mine, this is a very dangerous example. if my children ever behaved around our tools, tractors, and farm equipment the way that bob acts around his equipment, they'd lose body parts or risk their lives. i'm so glad i watched this before i allowed my children to see it (or in this case, didn't allow them to see it)!!"
2,"There is a reason for all the cheap, used copies of this","This particular video features Lofty and Muck more than any other characters from the show. Nearly all of the episodes deal with one or another phobia (Lofty's fear of heights and general tentativeness, Muck's fear of the dark...and mice...and sounds at night). Both characters are shown whining on and on and on about their fears. It's truly annoying. Shows that deal with phobias can potentially help a toddler get over those fears, but this video simply reinforces them without showing characters that have overcome their fears. Each new episode starts with the same rediculous amount of fear and trepidation. Can we fix it? ""Uh, I think so....""Other features I dislike are scenes of Spud the scarecrow taunting Lofty about his fears, and Bob exhibiting poor judgement about safety.My husband and I think Lofty should be fired. Please rent this before buying. Let's not encourage them to make any more copies of it."
3,Not quite up to snuff,"I'm a big Bob the Builder fan, looking forward to new episodes almost as much as my two-year-old. (I should probably be embarrassed to admit this!) But this video is not one of my favorites. The stories seem to focus almost exclusively on the various fears of Lofty and Muck, and consequently there's more than the usual amount of whining and crises of confidence. Several of the characters are seen telling ""white lies"" which they are never called to rectify. Also, there's very little of Travis (my son's favorite) and Farmer Pickles, and in Spud's one appearance he transcends mischievous to become downright mean.It's still good. The usual Bob attention to quality is intact, and there are good messages to be gleaned. But on the whole it's a somewhat negative experience for children. You'd do much better with ""Pets in a Pickle"" or ""Can We Fix It?"""
2,I agree--Wendy should be a psychiatrist,"My three year old son loves BTB and is collecting quite a selection of the toys and videos. My wife and I share the concern about the phobic equipment. This is the only video that seems to concentrate on fears of darkness, height, and weather, and since my son has not expressed these fears, I'm not interested in encouraging them. The other videos are great and I particularly like that Wendy is an equal partner with Bob in many respects."
4,Cotton Candy in VCR form,"And my 2 year old son just eats it up, over and over. I dont know where or how he first discovered Bob, but since he did, his life resolves around him and his friends, spud, lofty, scoop, and the rest. The movie has a odd claymation type animation, but seems to work well with the material. The messages are good and honest. I like the fact that fear is shown as something that we all deal with and we each have different fears and strengths."
2,"Not ""Great"" Condition...","The price of this DVD was definitely not the issue, but the description was. It was described as ""in great condition"", and it should have been ""good"" at the very best. The DVD did work, but it was very, very scratched."
3,It's OK,"Like all the other Bob the Builder videos ""it's ok"" is about as nice a thing you can say. There's nothing much memorable about any of the stories. And the characters can get grating after a while. If I was forced to find one good thing about it I'd have to say that the clay-mation is good. That's about all."
2,Difficult DVD with poor instruction,"Any instructional martial arts or juggling DVD should, of course, show the techniques in slow motion so that viewers can see and learn the techniques. This DVD, however, seems to be more interested in showcasing the speed of the instructors rather than allowing viewers to learn anything. Most of the action on this DVD is little more than a blur of spinning wood.It's cool, yeah. But you can't learn much from it. Audio levels are far too high, and there's a lot of audio clipping on this DVD. This is a very poorly produced DVD and I don't recommend it."
4,Brilliant Comedy,"In most of my reviews, I have noted I'm not a fan of comedy anime, and other such wacky series. However, my taste has branched out of late. And it led me to take a look at Miami Guns, which ran across via the wired. Nevertheless, this anime is beyond brilliant. It takes cultural perspectives from Japan, to America and blends them into a matrix of pure laughter and gut busting gags. Making fun of Die-Hard, to Wrestling. This anime by far, has class, intelligence (stupidity) and just flat out fun. This is a series any anime fan should own. Trust me once you purchase the first DVD, you'll want the second DVD right then and there."
3,Good for the price.,Not the best product on a market but the price is good and the quality is reasonable. The dril bits got worn after using them 4-5 times but for this price theyy are ok
1,Save your money.,"If you are using this set on aluminum or wood, it might be a good buy. I got it for use at work and have already ruined two bits on the first try at drilling. I should have sprung for a more professional set, instead of trying to go cheap."
3,"Not great quality, one bit wasn't left-handed!","Okay, so they are (mostly) as described. One of the bits in my package was right-handed instead of left-handed. Don't know why, but of course it was the one bit I needed to use when I bought the pack. That was very frustrating. The case is decent, and the bits do work when they are left-handed."
2,review of left handed drill set,I should have bought better quality drills --- had to use in a drill press --- could not use with a hand held drill.
3,A bit long-winded,"Tiles is a progressive band that blends the long instrumentals of Dream Theater with the vocal stylings of Rush. While this CD has some decent material on it, it is too long-winded. Tiles has taken about 25 minutes worth of good melodic ideas and stretched them out to over 60 minutes. This album would have been better if it had been more concise."
3,What was the author thinking?,"Really BAD ideas throughout history. A collection of tales, some of which really look like urban legends, which show that intelligence in the human species tends to be rather scattered. However, some of the tales told out of context when looked at with a little bit of sympathy could easily be construed as the best the persons involved could come up with at that time and in that circumstance. It does make for interesting bathroom reading, somewhat like reading a joke book or a book of trivia."
5,Ok saw for the home,9.00 saws but decent saws for a homeowner. They cut a straight line and have a decently small kerf for what they are. They come with some funky teeth and a funky looking set... sort of a wavy set if you know what I mean. I planned on filing one rip and leaving the other crosscut....but it looks like after a while Im going to actually file the other one as crosscut...Handles are huge...so I wouldnt recommened the saw for women or men with small hands.
2,popcorn popper,"The handle on this item broke the first day it was used. It isn't very sturdy. However, it was fixable and can still be used. Other than that, it does a sufficient job of popping popcorn over a flame."
4,A fine piece of equipment for camp.,"The quality, size, and design of this item is functional for popping popcorn over a campfire. Not liking ""unitask"" cookware in my own kitchen, much less when camping, it has done well heating beans, boiling water, etc. when used on a grate over the fire. the extending handle is a nice, and often necessary, feature when using it for popcorn. I have had no issues with the lid staying on, and it is just heavy enough to keep the popcorn from popping out. I have often used it dry and it works just fine, and it works even better when I am so decadent as to use a mix of butter and oil. The interior is fairly cheap nonstick, so don't use it for anything that might burn on and require scrubbing."
4,Delta Force Action,"The graphics were definitely not PS3, more like Desert Storm for PS2. The gameplay was good. Challenging. Easy to get killed. Inferior players will hate this game, because it will be too realistic and hard for them. Advanced players will find it challenging. Some levels will require precision firing and tactical capability to succeed. I wish they had better selection of weapons, and better graphics, of course. It will be a good game if they make it for PS3. Black was a fun shooter game with plenty of medical packs around, but not this game. So you better watch your health, fire accurately, and don't walk into ambushes. Fun game overall."
4,Solid pickup,"Personally, I really like this game. It is realistic & challenging. I don't like games that have ""health packs"" that immediately heal you upon touching them littered all over the battle field, and this game is not like that. You need to use team members intelligently to set up fields of fire and cover each others advance and such. It is not very forgiving with aim & hitting targets, which is more realistic as well. I really enjoyed the game, and you will too, if you enjoy the challenge & can get past the learing curve early on."
1,poor on every level,"Maybe I am spoiled by Black but this game has every possible problem.Cant see the bad guys till they are right on top of you so you die before you even know where they are.Jerky movements,very slow weapon switch.I could go on but you get the idea."
2,Complete Waste of Time & Money,Bought this game on a whim. It looks as though every short-cut possible was taken when designing and programming the 'plot' and gameplay. Take a pass on this one.
3,"Slow, boring read","This book was a very difficult read. Too much drivel to make me want to read it. Had to force myself to pick it up to read. The whole book was as cluttered and messy as the primary character Jane. Chaotic, unorganized ramble."
3,eh........,"let me start out by saying , i love count basie live.....but not on this cd....the sound sucks and it just did'nt move me like Breakfast and BBQ....I LISTEN IT ONCE ,TOOK IT OUT OF MY CAR CD PLAYER, AND CHALKED IT UP TO, SOMETIMES OTHER REVIEWS ARE VERY RIGHT....."
2,Crappy and poorly designed,"Other than the fact that these headlight covers look good on the car color wise, they suck. Covers don't cover headlights completely. They curve around the headlight all around the headlight except for where the signals are. Making them look retarded up close. These smoke covers will hinder the amount of light coming from your headlights dramatically. I ended up breaking one of the covers while re installing because I pulled on 1 just a lil to hard. No where on the internet is there an actual ""car specific picture"" of these covers. Just a lame stock picture everyone is using. Don't waist your time with these. I'm going with the ones made by Auto VentShade."
1,Lousy sound quality,"Too bad I can't return these! I use these with the Sony Bluetooth iPod Transmitter/iPod. After my similar Insignia Bluetooth headphones started falling apart within less than a year (still functional, but flimsy, lost ear pad, coming apart, etc), I got these hoping for a good replacement. They seem more solidly constructed, but the SOUND QUALITY is atrocious. It's stereo, but it's like listening to your music over the telephone. I fired up the old Insignia pair to make sure I wasn't imagining it, and it's a substantial difference in sound quality. I wouldn't recommend these for listening to music."
2,"Could be better, a lot better","I bought these to use with my laptop so I didn't have to have wires and could get up and move around. The sound quality is fine for casual listening of music and basic computer needs. My real problems came with the uncomfortable fit of these headphones. I can't wear them for more than maybe 15 minutes before they start hurting my ears. Also, the on-the-ear- design rather than a over-the-ear- design adds to my discomfort. They also have a habit of cutting in and our, yet I know that it's the headphone's fault because I have other bluetooth devices synced with my laptop and they all work great.These headphones are allright for the price, but I encourage people to look for another brand."
1,My Bad,"I was unduly harsh with the 1-star: I'd give it 2 upon reflection. However, now I understand why Moto is tanking. The sound on these music oriented headsets is awful.There are 2 Bluetooth profiles. If you chose the stereo profile the sound improves but the high end is still very thin, the bass distorts, and the overall volume is quite soft."
2,Not impressed,"The fit is very uncomfortable, and for some reason, I constantly have to re-pair these headphones with my devices, as they don't recognize like they should. The ""Bluetooth"" logo on the back of the headset band fell off while still in the box. I highly recommend that you DO NOT buy these terrible things."
2,Intolerable to wear,"A non-adjustable band and behind the neck style make these over-weight head phones impossible to wear working-out or jogging.Impossible for multiple reasons. A fall to the floor will result during any activity. Having awkward fit and heavy batteries will keep these headphones from staying on your head. The over-the-ear wrapping causes pain after 15 minutes, and will bend your ears out making you look like an elf missing chromosomes.Non-ergonomic features are outstanding: great battery life, wireless range, phone and music features, but none of those matter if you can't wear them."
3,Vito,- good battery life- good sound-very very uncomfortable-very very very heavyI will not advise it to my friend
5,Great product for its price.,I love my headphones. The sound is very crisp and clear. Very awesome headphones especially for the price. Although sometimes it would get disconnected with my phone for reasons unknown to me but that rarely happened. I would recommend this headphones to anyone.
1,Very Good and some Bad,"I have done years of strenuous aerobics. From that point of view, this program is very slow moving and very easy.On the other hand, I am an older female having a baby for the first time and cannot do any strenuous aerobics. Also, my coordination has seemed to have completely deserted me. I also have no idea of what I can and can't do for exercise when I'm pregnant. If anyone is in this state, this is the video for you. All the talking in between just gives you a bit of rest and you get a nice easy workout that provides you a benefit in keeping your muscles stretched and toned for labor. It helps with back pain and general fatigue. Also, it helps prepare your abs and ""pelvic floor"" for labor.I would highly recommend this program to the following pregnant people:older than 30, out of shape, or those having coordination problems."
2,Not what I thought.,I thought that this DVD would be more of a cardio stay in shape video but it's more for the gal who wants to get in shape for delivery. It offers great muscle toning workouts for the muscles you will use in the delivery process but unfortunately little else. I also found things were over explained but again this could be good if your just starting out.
2,Ur babies attention span!,My daughter lost intrest quickly and it is near impossible to do all the floor moves with a wandering baby or one that thinks ur a play toy cuz ur doin floor exercise's! My 5 yo wanted me to use him as the baby...that was intresting! I now do work outs while she is napping and really like the buns of steel post natal work out!
5,I have devoured your books!,"Your whole family is an inspiration but Victoria, you have really inspired me. Your motherly love to heal your son and hence the rest of your family plus your determination to find a method to help people stay raw is AMAZING. I have devoured your books, 12 steps, Raw Family, and your children's cookbook in the past week. The 12 Steps was exactly what I needed."
2,Not for me,"I guess I just can't jump onto the raw food bandwagon and actually, I have no reason to as I'm healthy. I read Carol Alt's awful book and then this one. This one is a little better than Alt's, so I gave it 2 stars, but frankly, I do not believe that fasting for what, 2 weeks, is good. Especially not for kids and definitely not for anyone who participates in athletics--I find it really hard to believe that her son could participate in marathons while fasting.It's just a little too much meditating and philosophizing on the wonders of the human body for me in this book and other raw food books. I'll stick to my fruit, salads and cooked potatoes & bread with my meat as a side dish."
5,Wonderful family!,"I read the book and I fell in love with the whole family. I could relate so well to Victoria and what she went through. I am now reading her other book, the 12 steps to staying raw."
4,"Easy, joyful, inspiring read","I read this book in one night, and have not yet tried out the recipes, though I want to do so over time.I really liked the flow of the story. Different members of the family takes turns telling parts of the story of their journey. It's kept very simplistic, which is a little unfortunate but also helpful in gathering the message they really want to convey. I get that message as: Be free, Be honest with yourself (and others), Follow your gut wisdom (body and intuition), Experience unconditional love (giving and receiving), Have faith in the Universe supporting you, and Have fun!I am considering going fully or close to fully 'raw"". this book gave me a simple story about people with serious health problems that truly were alleviated by their change of diet and lifestyle. The adventures they embarked on are really real and really inspiring, posing deep questions for us now in our society... Thanks Boutenkos."
4,Very interesting!,I really enjoy reading about people who've come to a cross roads in life and have turned it into a complete positive. This entire family changed their lives and seem to be truly happy and healthy. Also inspirational!
2,Little Disappointed,"I saw Victoria Boutenko speak on The Simply Raw Encyclopedia dvd and was quite impressed. So, I think my expectations were a little too high for this book. It's tiny, barely more than a pamphlet. It's poorly-organized, interview-style format was cumbersome to me. I wanted information like she had presented on greens in the dvd, instead it was this airy-fairy tale of the Boutenkos adventures with little in the way of solid info., you can sink your teeth into. A lot of people have been inspired to make positive changes in their lives after reading this book though, so don't go by me. Read it yourself. I would suggest you borrow it before you buy if possible."
1,A HUGE DISSAPOINTMENT!!!!!,I bought this book thinking i would get some good practice..instead when i opened it i thought some questions looked familiar...so i took out the 2006 version of this book and compared the two.....BOTH ARE EXACTLY THE SAME...ALL 12 TEST..ALL THE QUESTIONS...THE ORDER...THE ESSAY...i was supremely angry....So if you have the 2006 version of this book then definitely dont purchase this book....If you dont have the older version(s) of this book...then buy it if you want some good practice....depite dozens of errors...you will still get some good practice....i just wish that i knew this book would be the exact same as the 2006 version...then i wouldnt have bought it...
2,"A lot for the money, but on the other hand...you get what you pay for!","As another reviewer noted, this book is largely identical to the previous version. Less acceptable, to my point of view, is the utter failure to correct mistakes that occurred in the previous edition. Number 17 on page 124, for example, is unsolvable as written and the answer is incorrectly reasoned. I e-mailed them about this last year and they agreed that it was unsolveable as written and assured me it would be corrected in the second edition. Well it isn't! Number 12 on page 491 remains uncorrected (in addition to the answer they note, it could also have length of 85 and width of 1). Several other typos HAVE been corrected, for which I am grateful, but one would expect much greater editing accuracy in this edition, given the complete overlap with the first edition."
1,Waste of money,"This book is full of errors. The answer key will state, for example, B as the answer, while the explanation will say the answer is C. The questions are often repeated- for example, the EXACT questions from Test 5 with the EXACT answer choices in the EXACT order will appear on Test 10.Buy a better book unless you want to go in circles solving the same problem for dozens of pages."
2,Pretty bad.,The tests in this book are nothing like the real SAT. Don't waste your hard earned money on these and go buy the official SAT study guide with tests made by the ETS.
3,It fulfills its purpose,"Even though it may have some inaccuracies, this book serves its purpose in helping to practice the SAT Test."
4,My Child's View,"I have no idea what is so apealing about this video but my four year old son began begging me to buy it when he first saw the tape on a store shelf, as soon as we agreed to buy the tape he began chanting ""Bob the Builder"". He has re-run this video at every opportunity for the last three days, and in his words ""I can't wait to get another Bob the Builder""."
2,Bob the Builder - Can We Fix It? DVD,"Just in case you were wondering the actors displayed in the product info are not the actors doing the voiceovers. Very dissapointed with this asspect, as I specifically bought it because of the British voiceovers. My 2 year old couldn't care less however so all is quiet in our house!"
5,My son love's this video,"My son love's this video. It was his first in the ""Bob"" collection and he still watches it often."
1,Stay away from Bob!,"My child likes these videos, but I have not seen very much value in them at all. The construction vehicles lack confidence and indulge in every fear. They whine incessently in extremely patronizing adult voices that are trying to sound like children. Forget this and buy Thomas the Tank Engine - a truly wonderful English import."
1,American Bob,"I bought a couple of Bob vidoes through Amazon for my son, age nearly 2, who loves the series. We were crushingly disappointed by these videos, though. The wonderful voices of the UK version (Neil Morissey et. al) have been replaced by American voices. WHY do they do that? For us it means the videos are unplayable because they just ain't Bob. British shoppers and anyone familiar with the original Bob should be warned. (Can I get my money back?)"
1,bob the builder lacks safety sense!!,"i was really excited about bob the builder - i think it's a great premise! but when i watched it, i was appalled! bob follows *no* safety procedures whatsoever! this may not be a problem for city parents who want to teach their kids about the construction they see going on around them, but for rural kids, like mine, this is a very dangerous example. if my children ever behaved around our tractors and farm equipment the way that bob acts around his equipment, they'd lose body parts or risk their lives. i'm so glad i watched this before i allowed my children to see it (or in this case, didn't allow them to see it)!!"
5,A great story to wrap up with for an evening.,"Finding out WHO'S SUSAN? becomes a critical issue when Susan is forced to search alone for her son. The daycare insists that Susan herself picked up Timmy, but Susan knows better. Yet no one believes her and one by one everyone turns against her, the police, her husband, her friends and sometimes even Susan herself. Susan has a secret. The first eighteen years of her life are a mystery. slowly she starts remembering and she starts wondering: could she have picked Timmy up and not remember? This is a two thumbs up novel guaranteed to keep the reader turning the pages. Once you pick it up, you won't be able to put it down. Get a cup of cocoa, and settle in for a good read."
2,First Hogue item I have been dissatisfied with.,"While I am generally very pleased with hogue products, this one simply falls short of the high standard I usually hold hogue to.I love the overmold design, and is sported on my 870 and one of the 10/22s.However, the grip it to large, and makes a very concealable firearm...BIG! I may as well carry a 4"" GP100 if I keep the hogue grips on. They are of high quality, but in my opinion really kill the purpose of a J frame.I wanted more traction, a slightly larger grip, and the ability to get my hand higher, up to the bore axis.The grip is too large, and I can't get my hand up high enough.Oh well!"
3,hogue grip,"grips arrived fast, fit well, look good, felt good in the hand, felt good while shooting, rubber has good texture"
5,hogue gun grip,great product for my 38 S&W special. Gives you a firm hold on your gun and protects your hand from the recoil with extra padding on the back. Love it!!!!!
1,"Mediocre, at best.","I had high hopes for this book, having just moved to Oregon from Colorado. First off, this ""book"" is more like a magazine in size and quality, although the cost is $15.00. Having read the book description, I was led to believe that there would be lots of information on ""where to go"" for big game hunting in Oregon. Much to my disappoinment, there is much more information on survival skills in the Oregon woods, availalable big game animals (types, species, etc), Oregon weather and stories from local hunters. No information on wildlife areas, BLM lands...nothing !! Also, the apparent lack of maps in this book is really, really disappointing. The book actually seems more like it was written for elemetary school children who know nothing of hunting than for serious hunters who want to know where to go inb Oregon. The photos, what few there are, are of extremely poor qulity and black and white. Not worth the money."
5,"A reader from Portland, OR","Being interested in taking up hunting, I found Hunting Oregon quite informative as well as enjoyable reading. The full color photos were great!"
3,"Quote: Billy Block, Western Beat Entertainment","""Chelle Rose is one of the pleasant surprises of 2000. A wonderful voice who expresses her emotions with honesty and dignity."""
4,"Quote: Peter Cooper, The Tennessean","""Nashville is supposed to be a town of weasels and jackals, but then Chelle Rose walks onstage, sings plaintive sweet but jagged country soul music and smiles like Minnie Pearl. She sings it like she means it, most likely because she means it."""
3,Spellforce: Order of the Dawn Platinum Edition,"A very fun and enjoyable game once you get it installed. Nice plot-line with different modes of strategy/tactices needed on different maps to win. All in all, rated excellent.Installation on the other hand, as mentioned above, can be a real bear. Due to the copy protection, any hidden hook process (i.e. Anti Virus/anti spyware... ick!). I almost had to start with a fresh install of MS Windows to get the game installed and running."
1,Boycott Aspyr,"Until Aspyr stops using Starforce drivers which have caused this game and Stubbs the Zombie (which I both bought) not to work on my computer and cost me around $80 total, I am boycotting their company. Starforce is an invasive copy protection system which denies you the ability to use certain LEGITIMATE functions of your computer and often causes games not to work for no apparent reason. The drivers also grant themselve administrator level access making them a very tempting target for virus programs. I had to all but reformat my computer from the damage Stubbs did to it."
1,"No Starforce, but does not work.","I have a pretty decent computer (Athlon64/3000+, Radeon X550), but this game does not work at all. Even after I download and install the patch from Aspyr (though there is no excuse for the game to not at least load straight out of the box), spellforce.exe just sits there and sucks up 99% of the CPU until I kill the process. Aspyr support is unable to help.That said, despite other reviews here, this game does NOT install Starforce. But maybe that's why my version won't work..."
2,"All these songs are included on the ""All Shook Up"" reissue","All four of these songs are included on the reissue ofAll Shook Up, which sells for $11.98, so there's no point in picking up this pricey EP."
3,Legends of the past,A fitting retrospective of the legendary stars of the past. The content is fine however the quality is uneven. Images too dark at times. M [...]
5,Makes me wish I were in my late 20's again.,"I bought this book based on the recommendation of Stephen Green (Aka Vodkapundit.com) and loved it. It was one of those rare moments where I actually slowed down my reading so I could enjoy it longer. The honestly written male character is very refreshing. The ""laugh out loud"" moments aren't bad either. Big thumbs up!I'm definitely going to follow this author and see what other gems he has out there."
2,Unexpected disappointment,"I love Troy Denning, and have enjoyed many of his books. That's why I was very surprised by this book, which really disappointed me... I kept reading only hoping that it was going to get better. I found that I didn't really care about the characters, that the story didn't do well at holding my interest, and that the ending was very unsatisfactory. I would definitely recommend Troy Denning as an exceptional author... just not this particular book."
3,FACES OF DECEPTION by Troy Denning,"I found the basic premise of this book very good. I cared about the character, his friends and their adventures. However, he never seemed to learn from his mistakes and the last part of the book just left you hanging. Nothing was really explained...the identity of his parents, the real motive Sune Firehair had in the task she set for him, etc. I would read a sequel that tied up the ends, but otherwise it was a disappointment"
3,"Worth reading, but about the end?","Being a big fan of Forgotten Realms books, I really liked this one. I would have given it 4 stars, but I was so upset with the end (it left me with to many questions) that I gave it 3 stars. All along the story, the author writes everything in details, why has he changed this for the end of this story? I wanted to know at least a bit more about how it finished. Despite the end, I recommend this book to whoever likes to read fantasy, especially all the ones that are fans of Dragonlance or Forgotten Realms."
2,Swing and a miss,"An excellent book from the first to the second-to-last page. The characters are wonderfully fleshed out and Troy Denning writes some of the best action in the business. Unfortunately, he must have realized what an impossible situation he wrote his characters into. Instead of coming up with a remotely satisfying ending, he cops out. This is not even a tragic, sorrowful ending. He just stops writing and leaves the reader with an empty pit that Denning dug but didn't fill."
2,Very disappointing,"I have read three if Troy's other FR books and enjoyed them all, but this one was a big letdown. The story was vaguely interesting, but there was no payoff (good or bad). And what the heck was that ending about?"
3,What happened to Denning?,"I became a Denning fan after the Athens novels, where he did his best works. I had high hopes for this book, and the story I thought was great, but the ending? It just ended out of nowhere."
2,Left Hanging,I started to care about the characters until the very end. It just leaves you hanging. I would definately read a sequel that could tie up all the loose ends and questions that it leaves you with.
4,A well done book with good imagination.,"""Faces of Deception"" carried with it a possible masterpiece of a tale but fell just short. ""Faces"" brought more of the Utter East's landscape but no more detail that what was seen in the Double Diamond Saga. The characters portrayed excellence individually but I thought that they lacked a 'togetherness' better seen in Mr. Denning's previous novels. Overall, the book held a steady ground in what was being shown, perhaps too detailed, and framed what the characters were doing and feeling with excellent wording and emotion. I gave four stars partly because I like Mr. Denning's work and partly because of the story. All in all it was a good read and I recommend it to anyone who reads fantasy."
1,Trash,Pure hype in the world of metaphsics. Not believable. a way to sell a book. Don't waste your money or your mind thinking of bending spoons. The mind is much more valuable than that.
5,Superb!!! Gorgeous!!,"If the housever catches fire, this book will be grabbed on my way to save the dog. Fabulous photos and recipes. Great reading pleasure"
5,Best In Many Ways,"I received this book as a gift a few years ago and have used it often. The recipe's are imaginative, easy and always well recieved by family and guests. The recipe's ingredients are basic and credible. And of course, the presentation in this book is a knockout! The food, the scenery, the dishware. All top drawer."
5,"Ah, Tuscany!","This is a book that lives up to its name in all respects. The color photos (250) are warmly, rustically lit. These carefully composed still lifes entice the earthier senses with taste and aroma and give the reader a yen for this beautiful region.And the recipes, arranged by course, highlight regional dishes from the simple -- Chicken in Red Wine, Chestnut and Rice Soup to the unusual -- Salt Cod and Mint Soup, Spaghetti with Sea Urchin Sauce to the sublime -- Snails with Sausage and Tomato Sauce, Pheasant Broth, Ricotta Tart."
5,Fabulous!!!,"The best cookbook I've ever bought! Every recipe has been great and easy to follow. They are also very healthy and delicious. I just moved on to the Mexico book from the same series and made a ""killer"" Fish Veracruz. I highly recommend both these books!! I feel like I've gone from a ""clueless"" everyday cook to a gourmet!"
3,Tuscany the Beautiful Cookbook,The photographs and historical narratives are very good. The recipes are not complex. The recipes just don't appeal to me and I highly doubt that I will ever make anything from the book. It is more or less a great photo-tour-guide of Tuscany will be practical on the coffee table.
5,we love this..,"book and the song that accomanies it. Even though my kids have gotten a bit older we still have fond memories of the book. We even sing the song to other children we meet!Thank you, [...]"
4,Enjoyable for nearly 2 year old,Purchased as Valentine gift for 2 year old grand daughter. She loves the book and Mom gets to sing the song often. Good for family interaction!
3,Wheels on the Bus,I expected this book to be a regular size board book but it is tiny - about 3 inches squared...good for the diaper bag though.
5,Lives up to the hype!,"I read all the reviews before I ordered this book and it sounded great. However, when I first took it out of the box I thought I must have ordered the wrong book - could this little book be the one everyone on Amazon raved about? The answer is - YES! My 14 month old son loves it when we read (correction: sing) this book to him and asks us to do so over and over. The illustrations are full of little details that he loves to study and point out: apples rolling on the floor of the bus, dog licking the driver's face, etc. A wonderful little book!"
3,Very Small,"The size was a little smaller than I expected. It does say Pudgy Board Book, but I didn't realize how small it would be until I got it."
3,Fun stuff,It's definately fun and enjoyable if you like to sing and dont mind looking a little foolish.
4,Sisters love to help read this book,My son loves this book. He loves to watch his sisters act out the motions when we read it.
2,Disappointed!,"The quality of the music in this book is poor. The music is the old, annoying sound, not like the newer books. There are greeting cards in the store with better quality. It arrived already beginning to ""go off key"" so I have no doubt it will wear out very quickly as others have said, but this is a feature my children and I have decided is just fine with us (the book is for my grandson.)I am hoping to one day find a good quality music book (with replaceable batteries) that plays ""Wheels""."
4,"ONLY 5""X5"" BOOK","BOOK is very cute but was disappointed it is so small it is only 5""x 5"" thought it looked bigger in the picture but all in all it looks enjoyable for the kids and I guess it will fit in carry along bags for church etc. It just wasn't what I was expecting. maybe I missed the size written someplace but just so you know it is not a regular size book...."
2,Lacking a wealth of insight,"If you want to get a better understanding of workers and the economy in the contemporary world, there must be a better book out there than Kapstein's. ""Sharing the Wealth"" seems to have been put together in a hurry, and consists almost entirely of paraphrased quotations from other writers. I have no idea how Kapstein got John J. Sweeney to recommend the book on the back cover; in fact, I have no idea how Kapstein got this book published, since he seems to have put so little effort into it. My recommendation to the left-leaning, economically-untrained reader (like me) would be to check out Dani Rodrik's ""Has Globalization Gone Too Far?"", a much more subtle, thorough and concise look at the way international trade is affecting the distribution of wealth in the world today."
1,Misleading picture!,This box is tiny! It is of such poor quality that I am surprised that Singer put their name on it. None of the spools are large enough for a sewing machine and the thread quality is laughable. The wood is scratched even though it is new and the side fold out trays do not work. I don't recommend this to anyone unless using it for an older child's toy.
4,"Great album, especially in this earlier CD edition","I hadn't listened to this album in many years and was pleasantly surprised. Usually things aren't as good as you remember them, this was actually better! There are a couple of clunkers but the quality of the remaining tunes more than makes up for them.I chose to buy this older CD edition over the mid-90s remastered version because this one actually preserves the dynamics (soft-to-loud ratio) of the original recordings. With some songs it doesn't matter as much but Elton John made great use of the slow-build in his 70s stuff which suffers in the later, more compressed remasters.I've compared the versions and songs like 'Better Off Dead', 'Someone Saved My Life Tonight' (plus 'Ticking' from Caribou) are WAAAAYYY more effective here than they are in the louder more-processed remasters. You have to crank the volume knob up a little more on this edition but it's well worth it!."
4,Enjoyable but a bit uneven,"Excellent songs like ""Dead Opera Star"" and ""Midget in a Junkyard"" make you realise that some of the other songs are a bit more 'throwaway' and not as well developed. But hey, it's an EP of non-LP songs. Thats what you should expect. Necessary for the hardcore Sparklehorse fan. Others can probably get by with their two full length CD's."
2,Irrelevant companion,"2 1/2Tiny EP has a few decent songs and a few disposals, nothing that really appealing for non-hardcore devotees to discover."
2,WAY TOO BIG FOR MY HAND,"I'm not sure if there's one-size-fits-all here, but the mitten is way too big for my hands (which are normal sized). This means that it's difficult to wiggle the fingers, and before too long my fingers begin to ache and I have to take it off.I'd recommend checking out the size before purchasing."
2,Over-Rated,"I think this product was over-rated! I thought that it sounded so perfect, but when I received it, the glove was too big. I have normal to big hands! There is no reason that glove should be that big! Plus, maybe my cat is different than the others, but it scared him to death. He hates the Kitten Mitten."
4,Easy to Install and Configure,"This is a nice little key lock box that provides a discrete and easy way to store a small number of keys. The four-digit combination was easy to set and the whole things was easy to install. If installing on a concrete or sheetrock wall, you will have to supply your own mounting anchors, since the lock came with screws only. I gave it four stars out of five only because I have not yet experienced anybody actually try to break into it. I live in a relatively high-crime area and I installed the lock with the intent of it being very hard to break into. Time will tell. Otherwise, I am very satisfied with it."
4,Careful with the screws,"So after forgetting my keys for the 2nd time, I purchased this item. I've always trusted the Master Lock brand, and to me, have always produced quality products. This product is solid as expected, but I was quite surprised how easily the screws striped when I put them in.. Yes, I predrilled the holes.. I had to remove 3 of the 4 screws and used my own screws to get it to mount on the wall.."
5,"Great lock box, easy to change combination",I run the Sleigh Maker Inn Bed and Breakfast in Westborough MA and needed a way for guest arriving after hours to have access to the key for entry. I purchased two of these lockboxes and they work great. The only problem I have is seeing the numbers if it is dark out. If the numbers were painted a different color it would be easier. Very easy to change the combination and large enough to store more than 1 key on a key ring inside.
4,Excellent Key Safe,This little key safe does the job it is intended for very well. It can be a little quirky to close if you have more than a couple keys in here but it does everything I hoped it would do.
4,A bit hard to open,I installed this as a more secure version of a hide-a-key on my car. Works as planned. Seems to withstand the elements (I have yet to test it in ice). The door it a bit hard to open. When the correct combination is dialed in you then move the black lever on the left downward to release the door. The black lever has a very small prong to hold onto and then it can be a bit of a trick getting the door to swing free. I am happy with it overall and less concerned than some of the low reviewers about security since it seems far easier and less noticeable to break a window than try to pick or smash this box open (assuming you know to look for it).
4,Key Storage Box,"THIS ITEM IS Well built, easy to set THE COMBINATION and change THE combination. I will probably buy another one for our church."
5,exactly what you would expect,I manage vacation rentals so i know a thing or two about lock boxes. I have switched over to this type because the front does not detach from the box - so people cannot accidentally lock half the lockbox inside the rental. I had been forever asking housekeepers and guests to not take the lockbox inside to no avail. Having a lockbox with a hinged front solved the problem. They are also a bit roomier inside than the standard 10 button lockbox. It is also very quick and easy to change the combination. The only drawback is that the black tab you need to pull down to get the front to release is a bit small.
1,Poor Quality,The combination lock is of extremely poor quality. Hard to turn wheels that are not firmly seated. Master lock once had higher standards.
1,Master Lock 5401D Select Access Wall-Mounted Key Storage Box with Set-Your-Own Combination Lock (Purchased on 09/26/2009),"This product does not live up to expectations. I purchased several of these boxes. One for my own use and one to use at my mother's house. One of the boxes I hung at my mother's, the door would not stay closed. Then once we got it to stay closed (had to slam it numerous times), it would not open, even when the correct code was lined up on the dials. Unfortunately, I do not have the receipt so I can not return it. I would not recommend this product. Spend the extra money and buy the ones with the keypad."
1,Can't Unlock,"After being exposed to the elements for about a year, the combination became stuck and the Master Lock unopenable."
3,My bad.,"Nice unit, seems well built and sturdy. Will hold quite a few keys (Master says 5). But...the numbers are small and will be hard to read in the dark. My bad for not noticing. If I had to do it over again I'd buy the push button, keypad style - where you can enter the combination by ""feel"" if needed."
5,Master lock wall mounted key box,This is an excellent key box. It is very well built and easily opened with the combination. The combination is easily reset if needed. This was a very good buy and I would highly recommend it for anyone needing a secure place to store a key.
2,Not for cold weather!,"For a few months I thought this was an elegant, safe and even somewhat attractive way to store a key at my camp. But once winter rolled around I found myself locked out a couple of times and have now gone back to storing a second key at a remote but safe location (nail on tree). I will give a graphite treatment before completely condemming this product but you should think twice before you buy this gadget, read the reviews and keep a second key around."
1,Poor item,"After purchasing this product at a local store, it was difficult to open, and yes, it does not want to unlatch in cold weather. That is hard to understand, especially when this is used for children. Now I am unable to get the master lock open and in order for you to remove it from the wall you gave to get inside it. My key is stuck inside and permanently mounted. Very frustrated and disappointed in this product"
5,Nice lock box,"Easy to set the combo, easy to hang and easy to operate. It holds the newer, larger keys without a problem. Some reviewer said his would not stay shut and that only after slamming it several times did it shut. No need to slam it. If the combo is still set on the opening combination, it will not close but remains open because it is on the opening combination. Move the combo off the opening combination and it closes everytime. They don't make these idiot-proof but it's pretty close. Real nice piece, built sturdy and should work for years to come."
5,Key storage lock,"Easy to install but did come with cheap screws that were too soft so I had to get better screws to install lock. Otherwise, happy with the product."
1,do not expose to the elements,"We had one of these, and it worked very well for our one house key.Unfortunately I found out how hard it is to break into. After 2 years it refused to unlock. After drilling and using a hammer and cold chisel I finally got it open so I could remove it. Great if you need a lock box indoors for one key."
3,Almost great keysafe,"Easy to mount and works fine, but...A)in our lighting situation (overhead institutional flourescents) the numbers on the combination wheels are hard to read, especially because some numbers are shaped a little odd (2 almost looks like 7). Would be easier to read if the numbers were white on black background instead of black on a silver background.B) the combo wheels are stiff to turn and the opener-latch is also stiff, and ladies can break fingernails on them. We fixed this problem by attaching a little stick on a string to the keysafe so that the stick is used to turn the wheels and to push the opener-latch in order to save fingernails."
2,"Lacks a ""key"" feature","A good product, with one important feature missing. You can't close the lock unless the code is entered. So, you can't let someone work at your location and then leave the key in the box without giving them the code. Yes, you can change the code anytime you want, but then you have to notify all those who have it! Maybe they'll fix this defect on the next iteration?"
3,"OK product, next time I would go with the hanging version","I bought this for my son and his five college housemates so that none of them would end up locked out of the house for the night. It was kind of awkward and hard to install. Plus we were all kind of worried that their landlord would not like it that we mounted it on the (completely beat up and falling down) back porch railing. But we did it anyway. It was easy to set and change the lock combination. I was sure that the first person who made use of the hidden key would promptly lose it, so I mounted the key to one of those retractable chains and double sided foam taped it inside the box. Once that was done, you had to be very careful how you lay the key in the box so you could close and lock the lid. Anyway, the product does what it said it would, so far. Just next time around I would get the kind that hangs around the doorknob."
2,Not so impressive.,"It took me 45 mins to figure out a way to put the keys (a car key & its remote) in the box without it moving when I tried shutting it. When the keys moved, it wouldnt lock. I almost gave up but was determined to make it work. The description claimed that it could fit up to 5 keys. I find that very unbelievable. I also tried putting my lock box key in there (from the bank, the flattest key there is) & couldn't manage to fit that in along with the car key. The product is rediculous and I plan to return it or just never take my keys out of the box."
1,used item,the mechandise i recieved was used. i payed for a new item. not good business at all. that is why i gave this item one star. hard for me to return it because i have family coming and i dont have time to wait for another.
4,good stuff,"This lock box was purchased for my child going on a trip with the school. Cash & credit card was to be stored inside. Credit card did NOT fit. Box is too heavy. Combination works good.A four star product, that works well for storing an emergency key outside the house or car for instant entry."
1,DO NOT BUY,"The dials are rough to turn, don't seat accurately or solidly and on the very first attempt to set the combination and reopen, the box would not open.I unfortunately bought two of them after seeing so many good reviews ... which makes me think those reviews are staged. This is a crappy little box,do yourself a favor and look elsewhere."
1,Lock is easily defeated,"Search YouTube for Master Lock 5401D to find instructions to fairly-easily defeat this lock. The video is named ""How to decode a master lock key safe??"" Fast-forward to 2:15 for the start of the procedure to determine the code. Bummer, I had high hopes for this Master Lock product, and love the idea of a 4-digit programmable combination."
4,Outdoor security lock,It is exactly what I expected. I was looking for a small product that could be mounted to a wall that would hold a set of keys to my home for emergency purposes.
2,"Low-cost, but easily jams and easily smashed.","I purchased four of these. After a three weeks, one of them jammed and would not open even when the combo was entered correctly. I used a crowbar to remove it easily from the wall. I then set it on its side and hit it just once with a sledgehammer. The door broke off instantly. The lever was now free and moved easily when the correct code was entered. If all you need a cheap key storage box that gives the illusion of security (enough to deter honest, curious people), this is a great bargain. If you need protection from people with crowbars and sledgehammers, don't purchase this product. Also, if you don't have your own crowbar and sledgehammer to break into this if it sticks, don't purchase this product."
4,Nice security option,"After having tried to hide keys in various places outside the house for years I decided to try this storage box for more convenience/security. The box is well made and easy to use. Four screws will securely hold it to a wall and thwart any simple attempts to gain access. However, a bad guy with a 5 pound hammer could break it off/apart with a few hard smacks. For this reason I mounted it in an area within plain sight of neighbors, but not easily seen by someone passing by. Also, I remove the key whenever I travel out of town. My family knows to keep an occasional eye on the box to be sure it's still in place and undamaged. For the convenience and peace of mind it provides I think it's worth consideration."
3,Solid but Finicky,"Very solid box with secure mounting. Easy to set your own combination. Opening the lock box can be difficult. Even when the right combination is set, it sometimes won't open. So far, with repeated attempts, it has opened. Also, usability could be improved with a larger lever to open the box."
5,Master built,"Quality is good. Pretty solid, but the small lever on the left side of combo is small. It's not difficult to open though. Large compartment for many keys and can fit a car remote too."
4,Handy Key Storage,"Purchased the Master Lock 5401D Select Access Wall Mounted Key Storage, to secure a couple of keys from our teenage son, it's easy to use and change the combination works well for our purposes."
5,House Key Lock Box,I bought one and mounted at my front door so if someone I wanted to let in while I was not home I could give them the combination and they could retrieve the key inside. The box allows you to change the combination at any time you feel to make yor house more secure. My son saw it like it so much that I bought another one to give to my son for his home. A quality product.
4,Not completely trouble free,"After two years outside I did have one incident with the unit. The lever would go down when the correct combination was entered, but the door wouldn't open. Some WD-40 and a light tap with a hammer and the door popped open. No problems since."
4,CAPACITY,"YOUR KEY WILL BE SECURE. I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT FOR A RENTAL CONDO. IF YOU HAVE OVER 2 KEYS, IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO CLOSE THE LID AND LOCK."
5,"Great for ""Just in case""","As a person who has been known a time or two for getting locked out of my home, this is a great way to keep a spare set of keys safe outside. We mounted this on the front screened in porch - out of sight from the road. We have 2 separate house keys and a set of car keys in this unit - no problems with storage space. Great product."
1,NOT A SECURE BOX!!!,This box takes 2 seconds to break open with two hand tools. I am not going to say how but its pretty obvious if you look at it. Do not buy this box if you want a secure place to have a key.
2,Very small for keys.,"He is very convenient, but the inner space is very small and it does not allowed to place keys of cars with remote control."
1,Lock box that does not open easy,I got this box thinking everything would be easy. well when it was first used by the police they were not able to open it. The numbers and not easy to read between the 6 and 8 digits. they ended up breaking the door down becasue the code was right but the numbers were to hard to read when changing the roll numbers to open. I would look elsewhere for something easier to open by law enforcment
1,Easy to crack combination.,"First thing I have to say is that I don't actually own this product. I was thinking about purchasing it because I'm in need of such a device, however after doing some research I have concluded that this lock is just to easy to crack. I wanted to make sure that everyone is aware of this before they end up buying this product and getting their things stolen.[...]"
5,Already came in handy!,"I left my house one day and realized I forgot my keys... I started heading back towards my house fearing that I had already locked the door. Fortunately the door was still open, but it still gave me a bit of a scare! Everyone else who had a key was off at work and I would've had a very long and sheepish wait outside of the house on a cold day.That's when I resolved to buy one of these key boxes. I installed it out of plain view and set my own code in a matter of minutes. It's a good thing too since about six month later, I found myself in the exact situation I had feared (yes, I'm an airhead) and was very happy that I had installed this!The quality is perfect - doesn't seem to leak or anything. A great product overall!"
4,Nice lock box for in or outside your garage.,"I purchased this lock box to store and secure copies of keys to my house and vehicles. It works perfectly in conjunction with a keyless pad for your garage. I mounted mine inside of my garage but it is constructed such that it would work well outside as well. You can change the four number combination quickly and easily. It comes with rather short screws for attachment, but they can be replaced with much larger screws for more security. The box is small so it can be mounted most places and hidden below steps or in other crevices easily. It is a good buy for the money."
4,works great,Works great! Seems like it would be hard for someone to break into it. I do agree with some other reviews that it would be nice if there was a little hook or something in there for the keys to hang on. I only have one key in there most of the time and sometimes have to retry/reposition a few times before I get it closed because of the key falling. But overall I'm very satisfied and would recommend.
1,"Not impressed, easy to smash or crack According to YouTube","Bought because it was recommended as a tough safe. Examined it at home, looked ok but back plate looked weak and supplied 1"" screws seemed inadequate. With longer screws thought it would be ok.Then watched YouTube. One attack was a hammer attack and the castings that affix the rear plate bolts sheared in a few hits. Second attack was a standard combination lock pick and was all over in a minute or so.Not sure I'd want to trust anything to it now, especially not as an external key safe for a property...."
5,Great product!,"My husband installed this storage box on our screened in patio about a year ago. We keep an extra key to the house in the box, just in case we get locked out - which has happened several times. It's also great to have if a friend or relative is stopping by while we're not home to drop something off. The combination works perfectly every time, and we have not had any problems. I definitely recommend this product - I need to put an extra car key in the box...just in case - would be great to avoid a triple A call. I think it would make a great stocking stuffer :)"
5,Good Lock,"You get what you see here very good lock easy to change the combination which I need because I use it to hold a key to my guest house that I rent out to various people. I wall mounted it pretty easily. Just keep in mind if you accidentally set it to a combination and forget it you will have no recourse but to replace it the company can't provide a back door way in. Don't worry its not easy to do that accidentally or anything you have to actually set it to a combo then scramble the dials then be like hmmm what was the combination I just set again. Anyway I have bought this twice now because of that but thats a user error not lock error, both locks i bought worked as expected."
3,great lock with one problem,I bought this to use as a back up key holder. It works fine during the day but I can't see the dial (numbers) at night. The design of the numbers dial is recessed and any light from above (I installed it below a light) is obscured and the numbers are very difficult to see unless you have a flashlight shining directly on the numbers.I don't recommend this lock if you think your primary usage will be a night unless you are prepared to carry a flashlight to help illuminate the dial. Too bad because it works great during the day when there is plenty of ambient light.
4,"Works nicely, but only hold about 3 keys",This item works well. It was easy to set up and seemed strong. But it won't hold that many keys. Plus there is nothing to hang the keys on inside. So you have to sort of prop the keys up or hold them with your fingers and then slam the thing shut before the keys fall into the edges or hinges and you can't latch it. But it does work nice to just hold them securely until I need them. Only closing it back is a pain.
2,Too easy to reset!,"I bought this because we have a lot of caregivers/nurses that have to come help my father-in-law while we are away from home. Well, the other day, one of the nurses accidentally reset the combo, locked it and now we are stuck having to buy another lockbox! It's nice to be able to set your own code but they need to put the reset button in a different place. That, or the universe needs to stop creating so many stupid people!"
2,Book order took longer than expected,"The book itself came in great condition, but when I ordered this book, the seller didn't even ship it until 2 weeks later! I needed the book for my class and ended up having to borrow my friend's book since the book came a month after I ordered it."
1,worst season,"I know I'm in the minority, but I can't stand Tiffany Wells. I cringe every time I see her. To me Sabrina, Kelly, Jill, and Kris were more real than Tiffany. When Tiffany laughs she acts like she is high on something. I just don't like her. The storylines of Season 4 are great, but it's Tiffany that makes me not like Season 4. The packaging is great. At Wal-Mart they started selling 2 Seasons of some shows for $20. I bought Seasons 1 and 2 in one package and Seasons 3 and 4 in one package. I had to get Season 4 to get Season 3, I don't regret buying it because $20 for Season 3 is still pretty good."
3,Error in Amazon's editorial review,Cheryl Ladd was NOT the new angel in season four; Shelley Hack was. Clearly whoever wrote this review didn't watch the DVD. Tsk tsk tsk...
2,Disappointing,"The story lines aren't as strong as seasons 1-3. Shelley Hack's acting isn't so great, but I don't think that's why the ratings were low. It's mainly the writing. There were too many Kris Munroe episodes giving Shelley Hack and Jaclyn Smith mere ""supporting roles"" to Cheryl Ladd. If they had balanced it out and given all of the angels starring story lines the season would have been more interesting. Plus, people wanted a chance to see the new angel Tiffany shine, which we didn't get to see. And Jaclyn Smith's role was greatly reduced after Kate Jackson left which is disappointing."
3,Certainly not the best season,"But if you were a fan of this show, you've still gotta have it. Of course, the best (and now saddest) part of this set are the 3 episodes that Farah Fawcett guest starred in as a part of her settlement with the show for leaving after the first season. The season opener also features a guest appearance by the Love Boat and crew.This was Shelly Hack's only season on the show. She was fired after this season, mainly because it was felt her character was ""too boring."" I would disagree with them on that. I'd forgotten how elegant and classy she was.Charlie's Angels was one of those unfortunate series that got progressively worse as it went on. But the formula of 3 beautiful women fighting crime still remains a crowd pleaser after all these years."
4,Charlie's Angels Hair fan,"Finally, Season 4 of Charlie's Angels! As a fan and collector of the series, it brings back memories of the 70s, as a hairstylist and make-up artist, it is an interesting look at 70s fashion, hair and make-up as we approached the end of the decade. Overall, just fun, nostalgic viewing. I look forward to the release of season 5."
2,Broke After Wearing Three Times,"I really liked the design of these sunglasses, they fit well and the gradient level was perfect. But I took them on vacation with me, and after wearing them for the first few days, they broke right at the hinge. I was so disappointed since I liked them so well. Had the quality been a little better, it might have sustained years of wear."
1,This movie tries so hard to be so different...,"...it's pathetic. And so of course it becomes so sudden some cult favorite among Murray-fans, and people who love movies I find it hard to believe that they really ""get"" in the first place. I bet the filmakers have a good laugh now; ""Would you believe they actually bought it!""This movie did not require much from the actors, not in a million years it did. I am a big Murray-fan, and I love a good comedy, but... This was not funny, witty or whatever the average person normally would expect from any filmmaker.Easy money, Murray?"
1,Sorry,I was really looking forward to this film. Eneded up falling asleep......The only reason I bought it was because a friend had leant me the DVD and my bulldog ate it.......I hated spending the money on this
1,COMEDY??? BUT NOTHING FUNNY,I sow this movie because in the back case said; BEST COMEDY OF THE YEAR that's is not truth..... is the WORSE COMEDY OF THE YEAR this movie can't get do smile my son i put one star because Amazon ask as minimun 1 star!!!!This dvd need comes with $20 insert in the case!! and thank you note to watch it!!!
5,I now lead a life of crime,I simply cannot stand when my enemy has an expresso maker and I don't! Since watching this movie I have started compulsively stealing expresso makers wherever I go. My fun red hat does not go unnoticed. They are coming for me!
5,love it,i love this movie. wes anderson is a genius. steve zissou is a god. luke wilson. bill murray. ned. red hats
5,I'll order you a red cap and a speedo,"I believe too many are quick to write off the film as bad or not as good as Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, etc. Part of the genius of this movie is Mr. Andersons contrast of childhood fantasies with adult realities. The whimsical story, ridiculous outfits, and a brief shot of, well what young boys think of serve to spark the inner ""eleven and one half"" year old within all of us. Yes this film is odd, and sometimes stupid but in the end i found myself moved by the sheer beauty and innocence of the film."
4,Love this movie,i bought this movie for my husband for father's day since it's his favorite. he loved it and has watched it several times already.the movie got here quickly and i was pretty happy with everything except that now i get a bunch of emails from amazon.
4,Intelligent comedy,"Personally, I'm not a huge Wes Anderson fan. Didn't really enjoy Rushmore or The Royal Tennenbaums. So I think it's a testament to the quality of this film that I really, really liked it. Anderson is getting more confident and creative, and I feel like his sense of humor (always dark and ironic) fits perfectly with Bill Murray's delivery.A very fun, silly movie. (Previous posters should understand that just because you personally don't find something funny doesn't mean it has no value, or that there's no humor in it.)"
4,It took a while.. But..,"Well I gave up on professional reviewers a long time ago, most seem to follow the flow.. and I doubt many have actually seen the movie!..Well, I got it on DVD and at first I was rather bemused by it all, I put is aside and later had another peak, and found so much I had missed the first time.. like many films I suppose, you need a second chance to really see whats happening.Well this film is ""fake"" to the end, is definitly not serious, but I did have a few hearty guffors, some real sad moments, And just when I thought I knew where it was going.. it went somewhere else!.. It certainly wont be my most favorite of movies, but when I want something light hearted, good fun, with some tears I will drag it out again..Take it as it is, fiction, fun and god knows what else actually.. You will like it or lump it, but see it! .. May be twice.. if your not to sure the first time :)Best wishes all.. :)"
2,This movie totally sucks.,"I'm a fan of Wes Anderson. I mean, a repeated movie-attender, and DVD buyer, of everything he's done.I own Bottle Rocket, The Minus Man, Rushmore, and The Royal Tennenbaums. I just bought The Life Aquatic. Here's the deal: they hit their plateau with Rushmore, did more of the same, and more, with The Royal Tennenbaums, and ran into a wall with this.It SUCKS.I'll own it, for the same reason I own Terry Gilliam movies, but I'm hoping for better. This was a piece of artistic masturbation, and I really don't appreciate what ended up in my face."
1,Buyer beware,NOT CRITERION COLLECTION! cheap one-disc knock-off made in Mexico!!!I'm so disappointed because i love this movie and i love the extras you get with a genuine Criterion DVD.
3,"Way too slow, but lots of great humor","I understand it's a parody of Cousteau's many flicks. But this movie, shot in a low budget docu-drama format, was far too slow moving. I hit the FF button more and more. Tons of insider and Cousteau jokes. If you're not a cousteau fan, you'll miss most of 'em and wonder why you spent twenty bucks.I purchased the DVD but dount I'll watch it a second time."
3,The Jaguar Shark!!!,"I liked this movie and everytime I watch it I catch something that makes me laugh. Bill Murray was great as Steve Zissou the burnt out Jaques Cousteau like adventurer. I didn't care for Owen Wilson and his crappy southern accent. If you liked Rushmore and Royal Tennenbaums you will like this movie. Bill Murray is dead pan, dray and hilarious."
3,Deeeeeeeeeep Philosophy,"This movie is about a journey in the past, beneath ocean surface to find something for fulfilling the sweet feelings of friendship an adventurous tycoon might never ever be experiencing in the rest of this life.Pirates, sex, plenty of shaped, body-built males and many crouches clad into tight swimmers.Perhaps, a heavy advertising reflects rather who were involved in creating this work rather than on a feature itself symbolising a life journey of outgoing persons, or?"
1,Ghastly,"There must have been many times during the filming of this movie when the director said to some cast member: ""Go out there and say something...anything, just so it is not amusing and you utter it with a total lack of expression. Pretend you just wandered onto the set. Later we will try to figure out how to market it.""The DVD of this abomination would be more useful as a coaster."
1,Maybe it was too deep for me,"If there was humor in this film it was over my head. I found nothing in this film to be even mildly humorous let alone down right funny. I think the joke is on the people who paid money to see it. Someone who says they see the 'genius' in this film is either deluding themselves, lying or a heck of a lot more thoughtful than I am. My advice: Avoid this garbage at all costs."
1,"Pass the chips please, and crunch the empty packet.","Sorry folks. I've struggled with Wes Anderson, probably more than I should have, at the urging of my nineteen year old daughter. No more. The Tender bums were boring. Rushmore gave a feint giggle. But this is the last straw. And if these films aren't meant to be comedy, do they pass as some inditement of their genre? Undeveloped characters, feeble plots, script thinness, Anderson has the lot. And I feel his cleverness has triumphed in an under graduate kind of way. Whoever suggested going to the beach instead of wasting away before this is on the money."
1,"A complete waste of time, money and film","The Life Aquatic was SOOOO BAD that we didn't even finish watching it. The movie is completely disconnected, as are the actors, the script and the plot. Bill Murray's acting was definitely 'lost in translation' but not in a good way. This movie had no plot and did not make any sense. It is pure crap. Don't waste your time!"
1,Ugghhhh,"I love Scuba Diving, like Bill Murray, loved Cousteau, and like Spoofs usually......... but this was horrible despite the extravagant set work.After 30 minutes my wife threatened to kill me if I didn't hit the EJECT button.Uggghhhh........ horrible film"
1,The emperor is naked.... again!,"This movie sucks. Stop kidding yourselves.Too bad there aren't any JD Salinger stories about oceanographers to rip off, eh, Wes? You really coulda done something great if you had some more Salinger to rip off! Or maybe some undiscovered John Irving novel... or maybe a little E.L. Konigsburg...?P.S. -- How dare you steal from Buckaroo Banzai. Bounder."
2,It was ok,"This movie was ok. It was the same people that made ""the royal tenenbaums"" and i hated that movie. This one was a little bit better. It kinda had some good action in it but it wasn't that great. Bill Murray can do a lot better. I don't understand why he's in this movie with other people who are funny like the owens brothers. I thought this movie was going to be a lot better than it was. A lot of people say, you have to be smart to like these movies, but who wants to be smart to like a comedy. The whole point is to have fun. Realisticly, this movie was pretty unfunny."
1,this is so horrible,"good luck trying to make it to the end, there's a reason this is not on tv, Wes Anderson's worst movie, I guess all good things come to an end, Murry's character is just plane stupid"
1,Worst Ever,"Bill Murray has been on a downhill slide ever since Meatballs, he has finally hit bottom! Fortunately I just rented this stinker. Oh my, did it suck. If you liked this then you'll like ""Glitter""..."
1,Skip this movie,Their is no life in this movie. Save your time to watch something that has a story or comedy. This has neither.
2,went fishing,"except for watchable and amusing performances by murray and glodblum and some intriguing sets, this sea-going turkey rips off everything from jacques cousteau to jaws to moby dick to your favorite pirate/kidnapping/terrorist film and never quite arrives. if only it were funnier."
1,"Trust me, don' t be a fool...","It's a disgrace they charge money for this DVD. Producer and actors should be ashamed this is sold.Fine if people want to experiment with filmmaking, but to release this film with big name actors and charge consumer, unforgivable.I prefer to have rated this with no stars."
3,Arch and detailed jokery but nice casting,"A bit of a filmwanker's paradise, and all the little goofy touches and exercises in visual cleverness strain at (and rip open) the fabric of an artificial and day-glo story-world.People who like to analyze all the clever arch little details will really like it. Definitely something to irritate those who demand cohesive and believable dramatic experiences in cinema. That's what Kieslowsky and Wenders are for, sorry!If you're the sort of person who is super-anal about how people are alowed to make films, just steer clear of this director or put yourself out of your misery. OR ELSE I will be forced to lambast Peter Greenaway's many failures here, be warned."
4,Wonderfully put together,The life Aquatic was a very enjoyable and colorful movie. Bill murray is great in this film and so is Owen Wilson. The female actressess were not very into their characters as the male actors. Plus the movie kind of went on and on. Thats why i only gave it four stars. But it was a entertaining movie none the less.
4,Brilliant but frustrating.,"Late in the film, a kid comes up to Bill Murray, who asks him how old he is. The kid says, ""eleven-and-a-half,"" to which Murray says something like, ""...that's the best age.""That is this film in a nutshell. It's as if it were made by a daydreaming, precocious eleven-and-a-half-year-old. Fanciful creatures. Cutaway diagrams of impossible vessels. Pirates. It's a mish-mash of ideas in a shaggy-dog story. I enjoyed it, to be sure, but I found its desultory, haphazard nature frustrating. I can't wait to see the DVD, though, because I'm guessing that it will get better with repeated viewing.I loved Rushmore. I loved Bottle Rocket. I liked Royal Tenenbaums. And, despite my lukewarm response to Life Aquatic, it must be said that it's better by far then 99.99% of the crap that's issued by Hollywood at the moment."
4,Unique Film Starring the Brilliant Bill Murray,"This movie makes up its own rules and I appreciate it for that, as well as the great performances. Bill Murray has been on a roll lately, and his range is proving to know no bounds. This movie has a very quiet acidic humor and underneath it becomes a thoughtful tale of redemption and rebirth. I recommend this film for people who like pure originality like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind."
4,One of my all time favorites,"The first time I watched this movie, I recall laughing a lot. Watching it again, I didn't laugh at all, but I enjoyed the movie just as much. I really admire what Wes Anderson did with this film. The story line does not seem the least bit contrived. The variety of characters adds to the enjoyment and the visual tapestry is always interesting. And, of course, Bill Murray delivers an outstanding performance."
4,Good movie but a little too long,"My wife and I watched this movie last night, and while Bill was great; I loved the music and we both loved the visuals we both agreed that this movie is suffering from a lack of editing. It was about a half hour too long! Now neither of us are one to shy away from long movies (some of my favorites...Branagh's Hamlet, the extened editions of LOTR, Apo Now redux, etc) but it just seemed like it was dragging. Cut about 30 minutes from this movie and it would be Five stars."
2,Wes Anderson's worst,"I thought Bottle Rocket was very original and loved Rushmore and Royal Tennenbaums. Thus, I was eager to see Life Aquatic. Unfortunately, I found the movie to be utterly unenjoyable. Bill Murray is out of his element. The dialogue is silly, but rarely funny. The characters aren't interesting and you don't care about them.There is a feel to Wes Anderson's other movies that make them so appealing. It's absent in this one."
2,Quirky is no substitute for funny,"I usually love Wes Anderson movies. This was disappointing. It was quirky for the sake of quirkiness. It was like there were random sketches squished together with no thought given to an overall picture. I don't remember laughing once... OK, once, when I saw William Dafoe in short pants. But that was it."
2,About as interesting as an episode of Gilligan's Island,"About as interesting as an episode of Gilligan's Island and about as funny. The all star cast, the soundtrack, the sea creatures, and the harsh and varied use of color add interest but the film never quit comes together."
3,Funny characters in need of a plot,"Have you seen the Royal Tenenbaums? Put them on a boat and you have The Life Aquatic. Willem Dafoe never ceases to delight me, though his part as a German research assistant is relatively minor."
4,A real grower of a movie!,"I don't know what it is about this movie, the first time I saw it I wasn't too impressed but a few years later I gave it another try and it made a real impression on me. I think you just have to be in the right mood. Regardless, this is one of my all time favorite movies and one of only a few which I watch repeatedly. Also a great movie to ease you into bedtime, in a good way."
4,"Wes Anderson's weakest film, still good though","Bill Murray stars in the lead role as Steve Zissou, a washed up and past-his-prime ocean explorer and documentarian. His best friend Esteban has been eaten by some kind of ""Tiger Shark"". Basically the movie follow's Zissou's misadventures, but becomes way too enamored with the frills and embellishments that Anderson loves to put in his movies, and the plot is a bit meandering, but all in all, not bad at all."
1,commentary is terrible,"Before your buy this DVD I want to warn you about the poor quality commentary. It was recorded in a restaurant where Wes Anderson and his collaborator met to write the screenplay. There is all sorts of background noise from plates and forks clanging to people placing orders. I found this incredibly distracting. Also, they tended to talk about their relationship as collaborators instead of discussing what was happening on the screen. I really like this movie and saw it twice in the theaters but the commentary was a real disappointment."
1,Boring,"Great cast, great locations, visually appealing... ZERO story & awkward scenes abound. Do not waste your money on this movie. Not Bill Murray at his best."
2,I'd sooner have watched 'Splash' again.,"If Besson or one of those other French guys had got hold of this material, maybe it could have amounted to something.But they didn't and it don't."
1,The worst movie I ever saw,"Despite the fact that I really like all of the known actors in this movie, this has to be the worst movie I have ever watched. It was as though they were trying to make an artistic movie with a dry comedic twist, but failed on both accounts. Thank goodness it was a download rental and I didn't buy it."
1,Dark and Intelligent Humor?,"There is little humor, whether it be dark or otherwise. I was not prepared for the immense boredom that set in during the first 15 minutes. Characters are one-dimensional, the story is slow, the acting uninspired. I think I laughed more while watching the looks on the faces of all 6 people in the audience."
3,fgr,Great show..Great sh ow..Great show..Great show..Great sh ow..Great sh ow..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great sh ow..Great show..Great show..Gre at show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..
3,This film grows on me,"I disliked this movie the first time I watched it. I'm not sure I even finished watching it.The second time I wanted to give it another try. I didn't finish it, but it went better.I think by the third time I'll simultaneously finish the film for the first time and like it very much. But I may never want to see it again."
3,"Quirky and original, yet flat at times","The whole Zissou Society schtick was hilarious and a few one-liners as well as the obligatory Zissou Society uniforms that you can't help but enjoy. That being said, the movie itself was somewhat flat and devoid of humour at times...almost bordering on sleep-inducing in my opinion. Owen Wilson (as well as Bill Murray) was not at his best, although he did muster some genuinely funny moments. The all-star cast wasn't given much to work with in terms of screenplay originality. I expected more from Wes Anderson. Oh well...it's worth a rental at least, although I must say the Criterion edition comes chock-full of incredible extras to make up for the lack of substance in the movie itself."
2,It's a great movie but it is not the product described.,"just to clarify I am not reviewing the film, I am only referring to the product. The product is described as a 2 disk, special edition but one disk. Also the title on the disk in inexplicably written in Japanese; yet, the menu and audio options are in English. Needless to say that description is as misleading as a wonderbra. But if you don't care and just want to own the movie it's fine."
2,Don't waste your time!,"I just rented this and wow, I want those two hours of my life back. Me being a marine biologist myself, I was interested in this movie but it turned out to be downright terrible. I barely cracked a smile during the whole thing, and this was disappointing because Bill Murray is one of my favorite actors."
1,There's a favorite scene,"My favorite scene was watching final credits roll. To think I gave up 1:59 minutes of my life for this movie. If you must watch it, at least have the wisdom to cut your losses after 30 minutes. It really doesn't get better."
2,"""I Wonder If It Remembers Me?"" ~ A Film I Would Prefer To Forget","`The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou' ('04) is one of the most boring films I have had the displeasure to sit through in a long time. Believe me, saying that is as much of a surprise to me as anyone. I'm a longtime Bill Murray fan and really looked forward to finally viewing this movie. Not only do I generally love his films, but I also like Cate Blanchett, Willem Dafoe and Owen Wilson, so I thought this one was a sure thing. Boy was I wrong.To be blunt and to the point; the film is not funny, the dialogue is uninspiring, the actors don't illicit any emotional attachment to their character and the plot wears thin long before this 118 minute albatross finally comes in for a landing.My recommendation, pass on this one and go to the beach instead."
2,Boring,I'm not a big Bill Murray fan i have to admit but i am a Kate Blanchett fan so i rented this.There were a few funny moments of Calypso parody but overall i was pretty bored by the end.I usually enjoy low key comedy but this was just bad.Guess it's one pof those 'love it or hate it 'type of things.
1,How Best To Put It?,"It could be said of this film that, under the guise of loosely connected, funny vignettes, it shines the klieg light of absurdity on supposedly - but not actually - serious matters; that it crafts a sardonic microcosm of life's misadventures, sometimes as a dryly humorous rhapsody, sometimes as light-hearted elegy; that it tries nothing more ambitious than to entertain with a string of offbeat, funny, but teleologically connected jokes that playfully pokes fun at itself and its audience.Or, it could be said that it is a really tedious piece of aspiring pomo bilge whose producers wasted a fine cast, to say nothing of having fleeced ten bucks from movie-goers nationwide."
1,Watch This If You Have Trouble Sleeping!,"I like to think I'm pretty open-minded when it comes to movies. I love Bill Murray movies, getting hooked on his comedy stylings from Caddyshack, Meatballs, Stripes, and Scrooged.But this movie, which got a lot of acclaim started out with a lot of promise (the dolphin scene made me cry I laughed so hard). But from there it was a free-fall downhill and I found myself wishing for the ending to come along.Other reviewers found the claymation styling retro, and maybe I missed the point there, but I found the plot to be non-existent, and the actors seemed to be lost trying to figure out where their characters were supposed to be or do.Rent this movie, you'll thank me for saving you the money of a purchase. Or if you have to have a Murray fix, buy Caddyshack, Meatballs, and Stripes and enjoy Bill at work!"
1,Stunning,"Incomphrehensibly terrible. I was mouth agape as I waited and waited for even a chuckle. None, nada, zip. Classic example of what happens when a director is taken too seriously and has obtained power to do whatever he wants. Like the Emporer's new clothes. Anyone who tells you this is worth a second of attention is selling you a line. He's naked!!!"
1,There is no zero star option,"I am a huge Bill Murray fan, but if they showed this movie in prison, crime would go down.. The movie is not worth my time giving it a more detailed rating.."
1,The Life Aquatic sleeps with the fishes....it's Dead.,"No wonder we have a split congress, if we can have mixed reviews on this, this, this I don't know what. Come on people this is the worst of the worst. My son watched it first and warned me not to, but I told him there must be some good in it. I was wrong."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"THIS MOVIE IS A STINKER EVEN FOR A BILL MURRAY FLICK. A POOR PLOT ,STIFF ACTING AND NO REDEEMING VALUES MAKES THIS A NO-SEE FOR ANYONE OVER 18 YEARS OLD. BILL MURRAY STINKS AT STAND UP COMEDY AND HE'S EVEN WORSE AS AN ACTOR."
3,"It sukkd, but in a pretty way","Yeah, there were witty moments. Yes, there were very slyly placed insights in to human nature, animal nature. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was good. It was also amazingly indulgent, asked the viewer to accept the movie completely on its' own terms, feigned no interest in cultivating a relationship with the viewer in terms of conventional narrative technique, but, yes, it does offer insight, from a highly abstracted perspective, about age, youth, fragility, indulgence and the most heinously underacted action sequences ever constructed. So, you could say you were wiser for watching it. Yeah. Meh."
5,"A sweet, funny, slightly dark movie","I like Bill Murray, I love Wes Anderson, so it makes sense that I'd love this movie. Add a soundtrack of David Bowie songs sung in Porteguese and I'm sold. Highly recommended."
2,"Slightly amusing, but sorry I bought it.","I liked the other Wes Anderson films that I have seen, so I bought this one. His other films are much better. We watched it, and now I'm giving my DVD of it to somebody who loves film, as a gift. I'd suggest renting it instead of buying it. It's only slightly interesting/amusing."
2,What Happened Wes?,I've seen every one of Wes Anderson's movies and this one was untrue to his talent. He is as good as a director/writer gets and he put out a piece of MERDE like this! I couldn't believe what was going on when i was watching this movie. How did he get the actors? I expect better from a pro like Wes Anderson.P.S.Rushmore is the best movie ever made!
4,Three-Legged Dog,"This is my second Wes Anderson film. I don't mean to be snooty, but you have to bring your film- and life-appreciation to the table to really enjoy the delicious satire presented in this film. Otherwise, your experience with the film will be like walking out of the store with the wrong-sized pants. Do you really know what you're doing? Gets funnier every time I watch it. Truly, there's a lot of high-quality craft employed here in the areas of comedy, writing, directing and acting. 1-star and 2-star reviewers, please return to insipid comedy efforts such as SAVING SILVERMAN, IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU--or TV reruns of FRIENDS--and start over. Thank you."
3,Probably his most average film.,"I like a lot of things about this. The Bowie covers are great, there are definitely some awesome scenes, but I think the overarching theme and cohesion suffer a bit. Murray is great as the lead but at times the script seems to be too wild and packed with too many things to resemble any kind of whole that you would be looking for after viewing his other films. Maybe that is the point. Some of the film can even get a bit boring and I don't usually say that with Wes Anderson films. Try it out. I'm leaning towards 3.5 stars but overall it is not bad at all just a bit average."
1,"$622.99, are they on crack?","I love this show, but the studio people must have been smoking crack when priced the box set. No wonder so many people choose to copy instead of buy. The only way I would buy this if they brought the price down below @200.00 so I'll just wait! Wake up and stop being so greedy!"
1,new and still don't play right,I wanted to see the old series again so i spent the money and I started playing them and I am finding it frustrating because the disks stop playing constantly I go back and again it happens. What a waste of money.
3,Review,"There have been a couple of disc's that do not play., and 2 disc that skips programs. My wife is very disappointed and I am as well."
3,Bad packaging is a great disappointment,"Voyager is a very good Star Trek series and the 40% discount is fantastic. If you buy the set before 4-30-05, there's even a $25 rebate offer.Still, the packaging is horrible, and possibly detrimental to the DVDs themselves! I've never seen such terrible DVD packaging. I took out each individual disc and found several of them with smudges and possible scratches. Also one of the tabs that held a DVD was broken and the DVD was loose. Truly, this is the worst package set of DVDs I have ever bought. It is also very hard to get each DVD out of its holder, and it's also very hard to put back DVD slip case (actually only half a slip case).The only good thing I can say about the seven season series is that it is Voyager and the price is is deeply discounted.When Enterprise comes out in May 2005, I'll read the reviews before I buy the DVDs.What a shame. A good series presented very badly."
2,Watch out for Counterfeits!!!,"I love this series (owning 3 seasons already) and decided to buy the entire series at a much cheaper price. NEVER AGAIN!If the product comes to you inside a Cardboard box rather than Plastic Tray style case and the writing on the front of the DVD is in Black rather than White -- IT IS A CHINESE BOOTLEG!!!It appears that these sets have been flooding the internet recently, but here are the problems you will find with the forgery.#1 the picture quality is only about half as clear.#2 Not all the discs will play correctly. Many will automatically go back to the main menu.#3 The sound quality is not as GoodIf you find one report it!"
2,Worst made DVD set ever,"Packaging is so lousy, you wonder how a big company could have produced it.There were at least 8 episodes that would not play at all or hung up after 5 or 6 minutes.No amount of reloading, cleaning or coaxing would get them to play.They hung my DVD player up so badly, that each time I would have to turn the unit completely off to go on to the next episode.Shame on Paramount Home Entertainment for the poor production of this set and for the high price to go along with low quality.The show, of course is great."
4,$700 for 7 Seasons ?!,"A hundred bucks a season. That's a bit steep I think. Why so much money for this series. I just bought the complete season to ""FireflY"" for 17 bucks at Target. $17 for Firefly or $100 for Voyager.Don't get me wrong I loved this series, but for that price I'll watch it via Netflix."
2,boot leg copies shoudl not be allowed,"I'm a big fan of voyager and though it would really be nice to get the whole series set. It was advertized as new and I thought I would really get a bargain for 150$. but I got a lot less than what paid for and then some less. This is apparently a boot leg copy, apparently form China. I have to constantly keep taking off the Chinese subtitles off and the images freeze up sometimes.I am really upset that you allow such things to be sold throuh you. I could understand if this were pre owned or used but it was clearlely advertized as a new copy set and I was expecting just that.Not really good Amazon. I've always had a positive experience in the past."
2,Big Questios,This very good Star-Trek-family series is interesting throughout and enjoyable for its relationship-centered plotlines. But... why would anyone bother to pay full price for the series set when buying each season in the series individually is actually about $100.00 cheaper?
3,Show was so derivative,"If you must buy the show, buy them individually as you will have a better collection.However, and I know the teenage males will not like it despite the truth, but the show really only drew an audience when they brought on the 7 of 9 character. There wasn't much there that wasn't highly derivative. Hmm, a stuff-shirted hologram character... maybe Red Dwarf, a far superior show despite a dwarf of a budget.I remember one show that really made me mad. The one where the Captain was explaining to Leonardo Da Vinci that although he was smart for his day, his brain was incapable of understanding all the things they knew in her day. She just couldn't even be bothered with trying no matter how much he begged. Come on, Voyager writers, get over yourselves. The only thing seperating the modern person from the ancient, is the education. If anything someone with Da Vinci's intellect would grasp things better than a modern person with average intelligence."
4,voyager,I enjoy the Voyager series however the transaction thru Amazon was not completed. It was cancelled & I purchaased the series from a different business.
4,entire series of voyager,great price for all movies just wish they had put movies in individual sleves. other wise no problems with this product
5,Lost in the Delta Quandrant,"Voyager is Star Treks version of ""lost in space"", albeit it's done a lot better. Voyager had some great storylines and has a good cast of characters. I really enjoyed the show. I got into Voyager after catching its daily reruns, and in IMO it's a very good show. The loss of Kess in season 4 and the addition of Seven turned out to be great for the show, as Seven became one of the best characters, and provided some of the shows best storylines. This show also has the advantage of being able to introduce a lot of new threats and aliens, since it takes place in a different part of the galaxy. The shows overall theme of ""getting home"" spans the shows 7 seasons, and is well done.The collection is made up of the individual seasons and the packaging is not very good."
2,voyager,While we enjoy the series the quality of the DVDs is lousy. This is the third time we have ordered this. This last time we decided to pay the premium price and order from Amazon instead of one of their vendors hoping maybe they would play better. Unfortunaely it is impossible to watch 7 seasons in less than month and still work fulltime to we did not get to the problem discs before the return window closed. Very disappointed with Amazon!!!!!
3,Poor Packaging and Picture Quality,"While watching the first season, I had an uneasy feeling that this product may have been pirated, as there were times that the picture was scrambled. I am well into Season II, and there continues to be problems with the picture once in a while--it looks as if the digital bytes are scrambled. I don't know whether pirating is the case or not, but I am not satisfied with this product. In addition to poor picture quality at times, the packaging is pathetic. The discs are inserted into small, plastic bag-type sleeves, and dropped into the box...I had purchased the complete seasons 1-7 of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and I was completely impressed with the presentation, packaging, and picture quality...this does not compare (except in price). I would recommend checking into who released the series before buying it on-line, and ensure that it is a legal copy."
3,Finally a price break,"A 3 star review may not be fair becuase I haven't watched a single episode of Voyager, but have bought the first three seasons here at Amazon. Finally a price break down to $35.50 per season. I will get them all not and watch them.I had to collect all TNG and DS9 over a long time on eBay never paying more than $50/season (shipping incl.). It took forever to win them all that way. Now I can just buy TOS, VOY and ENT for $35/each with free shipping. This is as good as I can expect.Thank you Amazon for finally dropping the prices."
5,AM I CRAZY?,"Hi All, I loved this series and I am a big one for getting dvd's of favorite shows, but I can not believe these prices!! Amazon has them for over $700, new and $370 second-hand...I am sorry, but as much as I would love these, I can't afford these prices...and ebay is not much better...what happen to getting a good deal for being a fan and wanting to buy the bloody show, just to watch and enjoy, instead of making a huge deal off them......I think I will be waiting a long time for these prices to go down, if ever..."
1,Too highly priced!,"No actual stores sell ANY Startrek Series anymore because they marked them up so high in price, no one is buying them. I asked the Best Buy guy, and he said they sat on the shelf, and no one bought them, so they got rid of them.Why they are $98 is crazy. Maybe if they lowered the price to $49 a season, they would actually MOVE their stock.I swear, were they not like $56 a few weeks ago? I was coming to buy one, then saw $98 and was like ""um, no."""
1,Never delivered - no response from email,They never delivered the product. They did not respond to my email inquiry. Tracking number with Australian Post said - no results found! You want to buy from them; go ahead! Tell me if you get your product!!Star Trek Voyager: Seasons 1-7
5,Just got it.,Just got it. Haven't been able to view it yet. I'm a star trek fan and I'm looking forward to viewing it
1,"Look out for ""cheap"" version","Ordered a cheaper version here. The picture and description were of the collection of individual seasons with all documentation. I got a cheap single box, no separate seasons or documentation. It looked to be copies, I did not open it and I have put a request in for return / refund. This review is about the set, not the seller or the series."
3,Voyager,"This product was okay. I have not gone through all of the disks yet, but two of the disks had problems. The episodes on one of the disks(i think it was disk3 ep178 random thoughts ) in season 4 were messed up. They seemed like the disk was scratched but there were no markings on the disk(i know it is the disk, i tried 3 different players), i might have just gotten a disk that was bad and managed to slip through quality control. i think one of the other disks had a simular problem, but it was so minor that i ignored it becouse i was hunting for the problems at that point, i probably would not have noticed it if i wasnt looking."
4,BAD PACKING,"What can i say, i love the show... but gaaaad... should the packing be that bad.. its even worse than DS9 packing, or maybe the same.anyway, the show is great, its nice to have it."
3,Not what we exspected.,I purchased this for my husband and It was not what I exspected. The cases are falling apart and held together with tape. Some of the movies do not work on the computer and some do. My husband likes to watch them on the pc while at work. I did alot of research thinking these where the good quality ones for the price! I do not blame the seller as they where new but when you open them every disc one has a nice scratch on it. It all depends on what your looking for as for my husband he collects Star Trek dvds and he is picky about what he has and was not happy with these dvds.
3,Watch Out For Bootlegs!,"Watch Out For Bootlegs of the Voyager set! There are many! If it's not the clear plastic box, but a cardboard one, you bought a lower quality bootleg! Ask the dealer before buying, and proceed with caution! Beware the ones selling much cheaper new. I was duped, but thankfully Amazon refunded me."
4,Bad packaging but pretty good product,The DVDs seem to play very well so far even though the packaging wasn't great. I would recommend this seller for they got the item to me very quickly and at a very good price. I loved this and all the other Star Trek series so if you're a fan I recommend this show. Not the best of the series but still a very good one.
2,Problem DVDs,"I loved this show and decided to watch all the episodes again. However, a full 1/3 of the DVDs were unreadable! This is a cautionary tale. The quality of the product is not up to snuff and should be avoided!"
4,I love this series.,"Product arrived very quickly, and was very good..I am in the middle of series 7, and I have only found 2 episodes that would not play,due to a scratch on one of the discs..."
1,Really bad vendor,"Over half of the DVD's in this set wouldn't load, or were flawed after they did load. It was so bad, that the seller, bently-west, didn't even want them back!"
3,TOO EXPENSIVE!!!,"Why does it have to be sold at $600!!! What is up with that, I will never get to own this because it's so much freakin' money. Do they assume all Star Trek fans are millionaires?"
1,"wow, is this a Chinese knock-off?",if I wanted a set of disks that don't work...I could have saved a lot of money.
3,not 2 bad....,for the price it isn't bad at all considering that at the retail cell phone stores they range from 10 bucks and up ... nice feel ..good snug fit also
5,Durge Dead !?!,"In the Clone Wars series this has to be the top collection, or at least next to it. Nearly everyone makes an apperance. We finally see Anakin and Padme together, alone. Anyone who owns a lightsaber gets to ignite it. Jedi and Sith alike learn that the cost of victory is so high sometimes, that it is a defeat. And Anakin figures out how to put Durge down so he stays down."
3,Graphic SF Reader,"A Star Wars adventure set around about a few months before the last of the not very good movies. Jedi masters abound, and Obi-Wan is on the hunt for one of the bad variety, who he suspects is not actually dead.General Grievious kills a jedi - Master Bayts, I kid you not.Apart from that, a lot of killing clones and busting up of droids and Obi-Wan and Anakin just making it out of places.One really cool double page spread of a space battle, too."
3,The weakest book of a great series,"The clone wars series is absolutely fabulous. It has a superb story and great art. It fleshes out Jedi characters that we don't see much about in the movies and does so in a very moving and exciting way.This volume is unfortunately the weakest so far in the series. The story continues to be excellent, exploring the relationship between Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker. However, the art in this volume leaves something to be desired (particularly when compared with previous volumes).Still worth the read, but don't expect to be floored by it."
3,"Decent, but not great...","Not the best entry in the series, but still pretty good. As others have mentioned, Obi Wan acts a bit out of character, and the art is somewhat sub-standard. Still, a decent story, and a necessary addition to anyone following the Clone Wars story."
2,Translations incorrect,"I just started using this book to augment my knowledge of Polish vocabulary, and I randomly started on the section of ""Shoes and Accessories,"" and it was to my regret that I found some typos, right off the bat. For instance, boty is not the Polish translation for boots, but for bots. Also, both words that are used as translations for hiking boots are incorrect. Trzewiki are boots, but for formal wear. Wysokie buty are the extremely high boots that women wear. The correct translation should be obuwie turystyczne. I was wondering if there might be corrections listed on the publisher's website, but the title is no longer available through the publisher."
4,adventure DVD,great video of places I love to travel to in CanadaI would give it a 5 star if the DVD did not skip at one point
1,Defective cable,"I bought this to connect a phone or laptop to my stereo system. The cable looks very good and appears to be of high quality, but I apparently got a defective one because only one channel works. I replaced it with a similar cable of a different brand and everything works great now."
3,"Lacking key statistics, more historical than analytical...","I have been active in many fantasy football leagues and Danny Sheridan really misses with this book. The point system he suggests becomes the theme of the book, so if you're not using his system, 80 % of it is useless. There is not much in depth analysis, and no real predictions! He continually mentions what players he has forecasted correctly, without making any new predictions! His Quarterback section completely skips Peyton Manning, a QB that in 1999,could be as valuable as a Drew Bledsoe or a Mark Brunell!"
4,Danny Sheridan knows Fantasy Football,"Once again, Danny Sheridan's fantasy football book is right on the mark. I have relied on his rankings religiously for the past 5 years, and have won my league 4 times. His commentary teaches you how to evaluate the true fantasy value of a player, regardless of your league rules. Plus, the tips provided in his rankings are extremely useful in evaluating which players to draft for the upcoming season."
1,Boring,"This video was not fun at all for me or baby. There was no music, and it seems like she just taped it in her basement. I agree that it was not interactive with the baby at all."
5,Excellent,"This book is wonderful-- gave me some of the best feelings I've ever had. You fall in love with the old shepherd and his crew at the outset, and the story completely hooks you in. I found myself laughing and at times crying out loud. It is about and old white haired shepher who wanders on the hills. Each December he returns to his cottage-- which is just a crumbling old shack-- for shelter from the cold. One year he returns and finds a young woman and her daughter living there-- a poor woman. This is a great annoyance, but over time, something beautiful develops-- but not what you would expect. This is a great book."
5,Wise and Wonderful,"The Wisdom of Shepherds is the best book of its kind. It is written in very simple terms because it is a story about a simple man who enjoyed a simple lifestyle until the day it was disturbed by the intrusion of a stranger. The stranger is a young woman with red hair. While the shepherd was away, the woman moved into his cottage. When the shepherd returns and finds her there, he is afraid the woman may discover the object he buried beneath the cottage when he was a young man.Over all, The Wisdom of Shepherds is a great story from the genre of wisdom-literature and, I believe, a true must read. Only be aware that the language is ultra-simple."
5,Kept Me Awake,The plot in The Wisdom of Shepherds is so strong that I stayed awake until the wee hours reading it. The story is also full of some really good wisdom. It is about a shepherd and a difficult circumstance he faced. The story made me laugh and cry-- very emotional stuff here but very wise. Really a must read story.
2,Not as advertised!,"Midwest Air Technologies 901114A Earth AnchorItem was not as described. The rod diameter was 1/2"" plus something for the red paint, Not the listed 5/8"". The auger plate diameter was 4"", not the 6"" that was listed. This item is 40"" long, but that is the opnly place where it is as described. It will not meet the holding power of the (as listed) larger ground anchor. If you need the anchoring power of the larger anchor, go some where else to purchase it."
5,Fun Tunes from Fun People,"This CD is fun and light-hearted music from a band that was a true delight to see live. I miss their gigs which always drew a crowd of people to dance, sing along, and laugh. In the years since I bought this CD, it has kept my fiance and I entertained on several cross-country drives and makes me smile whenever I slide it into my stereo. My favorites are ""The Princess and the Horseman of the Apocalpse...(aka ""the Unicorn Song""), ""New Jersey"", ""I Met a Man"", ""Green Glass"", ""Driving on 9"", ""Swiss Chard"", and ""Calypso on the Beach"". I even bought a tee-shirt at one of the gigs with the cover art and lyrics to all the songs... (sniff!) I miss Ed's :("
3,Read this book after watching ten of his films,"I would just go ahead and watch ten of Kurosawa's films. Then it is somewhat interesting to read this book to understand some connections between the films and techniques employed. The book is written in an accessible style, yet serious. Many books about films have a very academic style of writing, not so this book. Only three stars because it is better to watch the films than reading books about them. And even the best books about film are not the most exiting reading."
1,"Skip this and get ""Doc""","Awful, awful book. Might just as well have been written by the deviant doctor himself. Totally non-objective and biased, and certainly not fact-based. This author seems to believe that whatever she thinks is a fact, evidence notwithstanding. Skip and get Olsen's well-balanced account of this crime."
2,"Interesting Hypothesis, No Facts","The good news is that Campbell asserts an interesting and provocative hypothesis: all hero myths have a common storyline. The bad news is that from the examples given in this book we'll have to take his word for it. While entertaining, the myths he uses as examples simply do not prove his point. Written in the middle of the 20th century, The Hero with a Thousand Faces uses Freudian and Jungian psychoanalysis to further his interpretation - something that today would inspire a few chuckles. Most readers encounter Campbell in college and believe it's a ""profound"" experience. It may be, and Campbell might be right, but only English and film school majors looking for plot lines and Psychology majors still needing a shot of Freud and Jung will be convinced by the evidence as presented in this book. I finished the book astonished that it had received the praise it has. The idea of the archetype is brilliant, the supporting evidence lacks rigor."
4,The Hero with a Thousand Faces,"The book arrived on time. It was, as advertised, in ""very good"" condition. It did have a few (very few) yellow highlighted sections which were not indicated in the description, but, as I will be the professor using the book, this is not a major issue."
1,Am I reading the same book as everyone else?,"After hearing about how so many writers were influenced by this work, I figured I'd take a look. And I just...don't get it. This thing is pretentious and bloated; it's full of metaphysics and discredited Freudian and Jungian psychology. It makes no attempt to connect with the reader; it just rambles on and reprints obscure myths and legends that have no real bearing on the subject of the book. I don't understand how anyone could find this book influential, or even coherent."
4,"Brilliant, rather boring book.","When I picked this book up, I realized that it wasn't a beach book, and this was not leisure reading. Unfortunately, I don't have time for non-leisure reading. The stuff I read in this book is fascinating, and a must have for any writer of epic/sci-fi/fantasy fiction, but I took it out of the library, and just didn't have time for it. Also, it probably would take many readings to retain all the knowledge in this book. A good one to buy."
5,Love his works,"- As an author myself, I recommend that you purchase this book for personal study. ""The Hero With A Thousand Faces"" is a fascinating book and video that helped me understand philosophical conceptions of life, death, and the hero.Author. ""Knowledge For Tomorrow"" Quinton D. Crawford"
5,A classic!,One of the great books of our times. An inspiration to anyone who is willing to live their life instead of just exist
2,Scrambled Eggs,This book seems it has plenty of good information in it. It just is NOT assembled in a form that is even remotely engaging. The storytelling is choppy and is hard to follow. I read the whole book (because I don't like to put one down once I've started) and suffered through the whole thing. Big disappointment!
5,Classic,"Its Joseph Campbell, a work that never gets old. After being a Star Wars fan this book was a must read."
1,I could only take reading a few pages of this book.,"Wow, this guy is way out there he is brilliant, but what is a pain is that he doen't follow any one story through when he is discribing it. He trows in so many different sotries, parables, ect. and jumps around I had a very difficult time following what he was saysing. The Keys section of his book is worth the price of the book, it is about 4 pages long. And really good, I wish he could write the way he did in that section in the whole book, but unfortunately he did not. You have to be way way way into mythology to be able to make sense out of this book. Good Luck! I agree with the fisrt revewier, rent the trilogy."
1,Hard Reading,"This should be the most interesting book ever written - after all, it purports to summarize myths across cultures with a mononmyth theory as the unifying force. The problem is in the execution, and probably the underlying theory, which is certainly out-dated. Campbell writes poorly. He is hard NOT to put down. And so, alas, as with earlier editions, I could not even plod through this tome. It is useless to my understanding of the world."
1,Hero Of A Thousand Feces,"This is a good general introduction to the barest basics of mythography, recommended for jr. highschool students or adults wanting to get their feet wet before diving into actual texts and theory.However, this book is no more than a New-Age philosophy manual - far closer to Deepak Chopra than the works of say, Roger Loomis.This is best for Star Wars-headed armchair 'mythologists' i.e. hobbyists with no true inkling of what the research of cultural evolution is all about. If you're looking for a quick fix to your 'deeper' questions about Star Trek and Hobbits, or a framework for your million-dollar Hollywood script project, this is for you!If you are serious about mythograhy, however, you'd better get a serious grip on linguistics and begin tackling the extant texts in their original languages. Any other approach is a waste of time."
1,Not well written,This book isn't very good-the author is very naive and needs to take notes from C.S. Lewis-a fellow whom shared the same degree and taught the same classes. Joseph Campbell is no good... read C.S. Lewis.
5,One of the Most Important Books Ever Written,"Despite what several other reviewers here have said, Campbell's style is vibrant and compelling. This is a fun and weighty read. It will change how you look at everything you have read and everything you will read."
4,Highly effective,"Very interesting book! If you're a movie aficionado, you can't put this one down. Excellent tool for screenwriters creating heroes."
5,Learn from this,"Joseph Campbell really does have some knowledge to impart. He must have been an interesting person and I would love to love what he did to become as great as him - learning myth to heal the human self. If every household in the world owned this book, the world may well be a better place..."
4,Rites of passage for every hero around the world,"Rites of passage essential to every epic, every religion's basis: call, refusal, trials, atonement, boon, perilous return, mastery of 2 worlds. Explains how the Good News is common to other religions."
1,Freud & Jung applied to mythology?,"The table of contents is the best part of the book. It outlines the stages a hero goes through on the path to enlightment, and agrees with our intuitions of how a hero develops.The main problem is that Campbell uses Freud and Jung to justify his theory of the hero. These theories are outdated and make it very difficult for anyone trained in psychology to take seriously. Moreover, the writing style is boring and the long examples combined with Freudian analyses belabor points and make the book drag on longer than it should."
3,more religion than fiction,"this edition from bollingen series its beautiful, nice letters, and has wonderful illustrationsif you want to read this book this probably be the best possible way...but this book its not really about storytelling or mythology and its power,its more about religion, and oriental faith than how to shape a character like the great character of the past; its much more about shiva than ulises..."
2,Outdated material,"Purchased for a Mythology of the hero college course.The writing is pompous and over done. He spends chapters on concepts that could have been said in one or two sentences.Based strongly on the outdated material from Sigmund Freud, this book uses a lot of his concepts and theories that have been completely discredited. Yet the book hasnt been updated or edited for that.This was often discussed in the classroom prior to class starting, so many other college students felt the same way.If this is for personal knowledge, or enjoyment there are other books out there."
3,Not sure what all the fuss is about this book,"I got this book because many people mention that it is the way to learn how people tick. It has been mentioned that this can help with character development in writing.I couldn't read it.Maybe I am just not cerebral enough because I thought it was full or obscure references and difficult passages that lost me time and again. I could boil down what I got out of it, which is basically Freud's doctrine about how we all want to sleep with our mothers (or fathers).There has to be something better out there than this.If you don't enjoy Psychology / Mythology textbooks you won't like this.I give it 3 stars because I didn't read the whole thing. Maybe all of the good stuff is after the first 100 pages..."
5,Very good author,"My wife has every single book that Wasserman published. While most were written before either of us were born, the books have ""timeless insight"". We even have a few first editions....."
5,sharp cut,"DEWALT DW3985 10/14TPI Portable Band Saw Blade - 44-7/8-Inch, .020-Inch, Matrix Ll- 3 pack did a great job slicing thru many 32' joints of old oil field pipe."
5,Dogs love it!,"I absolutely love this product, and I am very sad that I can't find it in stores anymore! My dogs LOVE this stuff - they think its a treat, so they LOVE to get their teeth brushed!! It also helps with doggie breath. All owners should brush their pets teeth, and this is just the product to make it easier. Your dogs will practically beg you to brush their teeth!"
3,Not as well-written as it could be,"Reportedly this is the best biography of French neurological pioneer Jean-Martin Charcot available in English. Charcot is a Napoleon of medicine and a fascinating man, so it is unfortunate that this biography, while thorough, is not terribly engaging. One feels it could have been so much better.There is significant focus on academic and medical politics in 19th century France (i.e., career advancement, credentialing etc.), which may be of interest to a minority of readers.The authors have not tapped all of the available, still-unexploited, material about Charcot, so there is room for others to add to his story.It is surprising that this incredible medical pioneer has not been the subject of more books. He was far more than a precursor to Freud, but was a giant in his own right."
1,2002 only!!,"well, really couldnt do anything with this, since it is fir FS 2002 ONLY... something that the description failed to mention... it wasnt much so not such a big deal but it still was a bit dissappointing though..."
1,Unusable,"I seem to have received something very different from the other reviewers. The plastic covers that are supposed to screw off to reveal the set screws-- they would not come off, even using pliers. Into the garbage they went, and then I took a walk to Radio Shack."
4,The Cable - Wanted more,"The Transatlantic cable was a topic that I knew of, but not much about. As I read ""The Cable"", I realized that this was as big in the mid 19th Century as the Moon Landing was in the mid 20th. I had hoped to feel more of this excitement in ""The Cable"", but then that's me. It is well-researched, well-written, and brings to the fore some of the great yet unheralded geniuses of the era. I just felt I wanted more detail about the technical end, and the illustrations could have used a larger-size volume."
3,Fair description but a little dry,"I was a little surprised at the lack of books on this topic, which I think is a rather important technological step for humankind. I think this book gives a fair description of events, it seems unbiased and fairly complete from what I can tell. However, the text is a bit dry and there isn't much prose or literary freedom with the text - not much pizzazz with the descriptions. I know it's a historical text, and from events far enough back that there likely isn't much information available for the author to work with. But I've read a fair number of historical non-fiction books and it can be done. I also wish there was a tad bit more technical discussion as to the challenges they faced and how they fixed it - you really don't get much of that. But I am a scientist so I have that bias. So overall it's a decent reference book but don't expect to get too engrossed with the story."
3,Pulls to the Left!,"I got this jogger as a gift and although I love all the bells and whistles - it is very difficult to jog and continuously adjusting because it pulls to the left. I've tried inflating, deflating, readjusting the front wheel. Does anyone have a solution??? I think the manufacturer really needs to look into this problem as I have talked to many people who have this jogger and EVERYONE has mentioned that it pulls to the left."
3,Thought we had a great jogging stroller!,"Until a week ago, we bragged about how great the Reebok jog stroller was. It has everything we like and perfect for both trail runs and park walks. Unfortunately while on a run, my husband was pushing my son (on a smooth, paved road) and a bolt sheered right off just above the right shock. Thankfully neither my husband or son was hurt. We are no longer able to use this jogger anymore."
1,DO NOT BUY - AWFUL,"This stroller does pull to one side and did from day one, and once it's together it's difficult to get parts or refunds, tires also keep going flat and it has to be brought to a bike shop to repair. I hate to use it because of the pulling problem, and usually never do. Do Not Purchase this it is a waste of money, don't be fooled by teh Reebok brand name it is not a quality item!!!"
1,piece of crap,"i agree, this stroller pulled to the left. after six months of using it the rear axel broke in half and no one will send free parts or do anything to replace it. i strongly recomend that YOU DO NOT BUY THIS STROLLER."
1,terrible,"I wish I would have listened to the reviews warning me not to purchase this stroller. I frequently jog (4-5 times a week) and was very eager to get a good jogging stroller for me and my son. I did read that this stroller pulled to the left, but I also read there was a way to correct the problem through re-positioning the front tire. I did everything the instructions suggested and then some. In the end the pull corrected to its best still made jogging impossible. It is a waste of time and money, I am returning it."
1,Terrible jogger,"I loved this jogger at first. Then it started pulling to the right. Then it broke on the right side where it bends when collapsed. I had only used it for about six months on flat, paved terrain. I wrote Baby Trend a letter and was ignored."
4,Good,"I run nearly everyday during the warm months in a local park with dirt paths. So far the stroller is holding up just fine. I do find that my baby doesn't bounce around as much as children I have seen in other stroller, but it's a it heavier than a friends model (Trek) bought at a bike shop."
1,Don't Buy Reebok Strollers,"This was a good stroller until the frame cracked in half, like others have reported. Luckily, my child was not hurt despite being strapped in when it happened. Pretty frustrating. My child didn't even make it in the stroller for a year. I do wonder how a large company like Reebok puts their name on a stroller that has such low craftsmanship, not to mention the safety implications of a frame braking at the wheel? So many bad things could have happened to my child! I do wonder if there is any recourse to take with Reebok, but now it seems I have to pay THEM to get a new frame. Really?"
1,Shorted,"This is a very nice tool however....I only received one of them, not two as advertised. I have contacted Amazon, and await their response. I will post another comment if they come through with the additional T Square."
5,the best book on yoga,"I have never found a better book on yoga anywhere. This book is written by a great teacher who came from India. It has a comprehensive set of yoga postures, breathing excercises and meditation. The only flaw in the book is that one should study under a teacher. For those who cannot find a teacher or would rather work alone, I strongly suggest working with inner guides. A good book on this is The Inner Guide Meditation, or a similar book. A teacher is necessary, because contrary to what others may say, yoga and other spiritual excercises do work. They work for anyone who has the time and patience to do the excercises even for a short time. Results may take years to come, but they do come. But given a teacher to see the results through which can be frightening at times, this is an excellent book and I strongly recommend it."
5,Stretch Your Mind With The Book of Yoga,"The Book of Yoga addresses yoga from a mental physical and spiritual perspective. It is a thought provoking publication on a practice that is taking the western world by storm. I was most impressed with the illustrtations. Some yoga books are limited in this area. However, the Book of Yoga delivers."
1,Comic relief,"This book is best used as a contrast with Iyengar's. To see Vishnu's hands and feet uncoordinatedly splayed in all directions is simultaneously comical and sad. Like many people from India, he is very supple. Unfortunately, he also seems to have very little awareness inside his body. And body positions without mental involvement are the antithesis of yoga. Besides Iyengar's, check out Vanda Scaravelli's book. She once said to me, ""Yoga is the religion of the spine."" Vishnu's spine is supple; but again, without awareness. When I used to teach yoga, I would bring this book to class as an example of how NOT to do the asanas."
4,Great for practising and theory,A good and useful book for yoga beginners. It gives you an indepth of yoga. I used it for my daily practise and also to do new poses.
2,beyond over priced,"I'm just shocked that this very small, practically weight less collection of articles cost me a total of $94 used. That's all. Shipping was good and the little thing was in fine shape, just still shocked by the price. I feel like it should read itself to me for that price."
5,Very Good Tool,"This is a very good tool, especially for the price. It was a great investment. When in need of couplings, you don't need them with this tool because this expands the pipe to slide another pipe into the first pipe for a permanent connection. For flaring, if you have carpal tunnel or arthritis, it eases the tension in your hands."
