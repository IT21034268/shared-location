4,Solin Sekkur,O boy this albums is in a way really good. Although it containes about 2 or three songs I don't like but it is really good. It doesn't sound like her previous albums and sounds a bit boring if you take a first listen. When I bought this and put it into my cd player I was like this album [stinks] it doesn't sound anything like Homogenic or Debut then i listened a couple times more and then this album is probably one of the best albums released 2001. If you wan't an album that relaxes you and takes you into a journy this is indeed an album for you. It could change your life forever and sometimes it will. If you're going to start with Björk I suggest don't buy this album buy Debut or Post. Then after that try this one. this woman is a genius and an artist.I hope this review helped you.
5,Fabulous!,"Well worth the wait! Bjork's music is so strange and wonderful, you feel like you are seeing through someone else's eyes. A brilliant creative expression! Heirloom is one of my personal picks... great song. The words (which are included in the CD) make the music even more colorful. You won't be sorry for buying Bjork's latest."
3,"Gorgeous, but suffers from monotonous pacing","This CD sounds absolutely gorgeous. But all of the songs are roughly the same slow tempo, and nearly every song has a serpentine, stream-of-consciousness melody and lyric that makes many of the songs hard to grab on to. This CD could have been so much better if Bjork had chosen to include a couple of uptempo songs or a couple of hooks to keep us singing along. The most singable track is the first.I do admire the unity of sound and concept here, and the arrangements are stunningly beautiful. I just kept waiting for her to launch into a toe-tapper or really belt out a song, as she can so well."
3,"Drop all your Expectations, this one's SLOWWWW","many people give this album 5 stars claiming it the best of 2001! Well I am here to judge this album as a fan of Bjorks first three albums, and this one comparitively sounds like a snoozer. I literally fell asleep after the 5th track and woke up at the end of Unison. Unison is the best track on the album, followed by Its Not up To You and HEirloom.U may notice that these three tracks are the ones with some UMPH in them. Call the other tracks genius if you want, but I like music to move me, but this cd happens to be way too slow."
2,LOVE SONG FOR MATTHEW,Vespertine sounds the same throughout which is not bad except it gets kind of boring. I know that this must be her love song to Matthew but girl get a grip! Just wish she would have put a few more upbeat songs-Pagan Poetry could be remixed nicely.
2,farily Ordinary,i have listened to past Bjork Albums&thought I'd give this set a full listen.well needless to say this album was very Muzak to me on so many levels.She has a Vibe about Her that you will respect Her Voice&Creativity.but this set is like Annie Lennox Meets Enya in a Blender&gets all mixed up without bringing anything to the mix.I Respect Her Overall View in Music Creation but this set doesn't work for me.
1,A Cure For Insomnia,"Reading these other reviews, I feel I must of missed something here... but I'm not a blind fan. Together, Bjork and Radiohead have discovered a cure for insomnia. When I listened to this CD, my heart rate fell so low my roomate thought I was dead. I also don't hear anthing new here, Hidden Place sounds better on Homogenic than Vespertine, and I keep on hearing riffs of Venus as a Boy in there somewhere. I cannot connect with any of this music, I need a melody, and there are none to be found in Bjork land this time around. Bjork strings out her vocals so long that halfway through the sentence you forgot what she was saying in the first part, and then don't really care about the last part. I don't even think that the French are going to put up with this one very long, even they like a beat you snap your fingers to. This sound would be good as one or two tracks, but not a whole CD. Listen before you buy... and yes I'm a huge fan who is very dissapointed."
2,I love Bjork but...,"this CD is boring. The energy, the oomph of previous Bjork music is gone. I fell asleep during the first listen and couldn't stand to finish several songs. There are a couple of gems, ""It's Not Up to You"" being the brightest. But all the songs are of the same tempo, with much the same instrumentation and themes. She could've at least thrown in one four-on-the-floor rave up. Instead, we get a bunch of pretty, beautifully sung, melodic yet terribly boring songs. The critics love this CD, which is fine, but I've been a Bjork fan for years and have enjoyed her growth up until this point. She feels stifled here. Restrained somehow. The jubilance that she usually conveys is absent, as is much of the scatterhearted creativity. Good for sleeping and not much else."
2,It's All So Quiet...,"In the past, Bjork has tempered her eccentricity with a pop sensibility. Even though the last album, Homogenic, was somewhat histronic, there were some great moments, like Hunter and Alarm Call. This album is too personal. I like Bjork when she's iconoclastic and edgy, like on Army of me, or when it's pure pop fun, like Big Time Sensuality.I still salute her for being 180 degrees away from N'SYNC and Britney, but I've always believed that truly great music is both profound and likeable."
3,"Better than most, but not Bjork's best.","I like this album, but I will only listen to it another 3 or 4 times. It has no sing-a-long songs. They are mostly slow songs with good beats. NOWHERE near the genius of ""Homogenic"".This release redeems her from the fault of ""Selma Songs"" but does not make me super-happy guy."
5,pure bliss,"Surely Bjork's lushest yet...teeming, as any self-contained eco-system should be, this is an audio landscape complete in its union of the organic and the mechanic. Bjork has found true love, and perfect balance at last and so will you! ENJOY."
4,"Imaginative, but not Bjork's best","Bjork rules...no doubt that she is ahead of her time and one can always expect the enigmatic. However, not her best work to date. Definitely surpasses the pop flava of the week ANYDAY!"
5,Her best yet.,"Though cliched, this album is truly a breath of fresh air in an ever-increasingly stale musical environment. Simply beautiful, but give it a few days to sink in... it's THAT different from all that you've heard before... but definitely worth it. ;)"
2,disappointing,"Not nearly as compelling as Debut. I breathlessly anticipated listening to this album for the first time, and when I finally did, I thought that most of the tracks sounded like cheesy electronica ripoffs of stuff that was done by other people a couple of years ago. Not worth purchasing."
1,Yuck,"I know its her style of performing. I know her music is not for everyone, but I have loved her previous cds, this one just is not good. Sorry."
1,The Worst Bjork Album To Date.,"I sold my copy after two days. I was looking fprward to this album all summer. I love Bjork. I have bought all her cds and maxi-singles. I have ""Dancer In the Dark"" on DVD. Bjork's music is some of the best work out there. But with the release of ""Vespertine"" I shed a tear. Missing from this record is the fun, lyrically rich dance tracks that have made Bjork a household name. The lyrics are deep and penetrating, but the somber music drowns her style out. Bjork's voice continues to impress me, sadly this album does not."
1,B(j)ore should wear a turkey dress,"Bjork is Icelandic for bore.I love Debut, Post and Homogenic. I really like Selmasongs. But I absolutely hate this tinkly, crappy, boring CD.I wasn't going to post a review, but after seeing all the 5 star reviews I just had to provide some balance. It seems like the reviews are mostly written by rabid fans while everyone else just doesn't bother.Bjork should have worn a turkey dress for the cover shot, because this CD is a real turkey."
1,"Is there Life after ""Post""?","I had hoped that there was Life after ""Post"". I Loved ""Post"". After playing ""Vespertine,"" I went to vespers. I walked to the edge of the cliff and threw off car-parts, bottles, cutlery, and whatever I found lying around-- my CD. ""Vespertine"". I listen to the sounds they make on the way down. I follow with my eyes till they crash, slamming on the rocks. I possibly, maybe probably didn't like this CD."
2,Tedious,"A tedious, bland and pretentious book.It has the air of being thrown together on a couple of long distance flights. The structure is weak, analysis superficial and exercises peurile - and de Bono knows it.Although there are a few worthwhile ideas to take away, de Bono over-promises and under-delivers. Predictably he scatters references to his other books and fatuously points to his achievements from the days when he had something original to say.An exercise in self-aggrandisement and shameless self-enrichment. He would do better to think creatively for a couple of years and distill that wisdom into something useful."
4,The Tale of Two Disks,"This is my first Ministry of Sound disk and it is great. You have two good producers/DJs, ATB and George Acosta, that chose a great selection of tracks to mix. Both will get you into the music from track one, you are not going to want the disk to stop. But only George Acosta will get you to that point. ATB, no disrespect at all, he gets you going from track one, the clubb mix of his 'Let U Go,' to half-way through 'Played Alive,' track seven. But the transition from that to 'Castles in the Sky' is not smooth. And from that point on, it takes you out and you never get back in. The mixes he chooses for the remainder of the disk just does not pull you back in, especially the mix of 'On the Move'. But if you are a fan of both, you won't be wasting you money. You will find some high points, especially with George Acosta."
4,Awesome CD,"Its so easy to give a good CD 5 stars... in reality, I give this MOS release a solid 4+. The ATB disc is very good with some standard trance stuff that overall is enjoyable. But the Acosta CD will grab hold of you and not let go... its an incredible mix that never lets up (the CD blows up with Derb). If you like trance and want that let-it-rip-at-3-am feeling, Acosta's disc will take you there... the energy just doesn't stop. This double CD is WELL worth the money. It will without question find a home among your favorites."
1,YOU CALL THIS TRANCE?,"In no way is this trance. Complete and utter cheese. ATB rears his ugly head once more to bring us a cd full of E'd up puky cheese. Acosta follows with more E'd up puky cheese. No wonder TRANCE died, it was because of these type of dj's. Ministry of Sound, continues to show they nothing about trance or progressive music. They should stick to garage and tacky house. Areas where they have shown their expertise."
5,great mix,"This cd didnt dissapoint me one bit. ATB as uaual did a phenominal job of mixing the songs and he had a great lineup of songs as well. George Acosta played good tracks too, the cd he mixes on this ablum is much better than his ""History of Trance."" If you are a trance fan then this cd will definitley fit nicley in your collection."
3,A pretty good read,"The story line has been done before in different contexts, but I enjoyed the cruise through the generational waters .. For me the real benefit is to absorb some of Belize's 20th century history painlessly. Ditto for the cultural information"
4,Good read!,I go to Belize alot and I really liked this book. It combines historical facts with fun and exciting fiction. I highly recommend it!
2,Love Radiohead - Not those wanting to be. .,"I found out about these guys from a friend and gave the disc a listen. To be honest, I'm tired of this whole ""I wanna sound like Radiohead and The Doves"" vibe coming from so many bands these days. It just screams a lack of originality, and it's sad. Tinkers Punishment is good. . . but not something I'd strive to listen to ever again."
5,See All says it all,"These things are easy to install, the only caveat is the hooks that are supplied with them... they are too short for drywall and studs. They probably are meant to be fasten directly to wood so I just used other hooks. All you do is install the hooks and then pull the springs up and onto the hooks, and that's it. If you are installing into drywall with no stud behind it you need to use a hollow wall anchor and something that the spring can hook to or around. Most of the time you have the top plates of the wall framing that a hook screws into, the hook should be something that is 2.5 inches long. These mirrors are not heavy but the spring does have some tension so the hooks need to be installed securely."
4,security mirror,"A little pricey, but worth the money. I work in a world of cubicles, and it's ideal for seeing down the hallway to see who is coming in the door."
2,lousy sound quality,The sound quality of this CD reminded me of late 1950's television. It truly detracts from the listening experience. Too bad.
4,Another winner,"Progenitor continues the saga of the Stargazer crew that was began with Gauntlet. In this book we continue to see wonderful characterizations. As in Gauntlet there are no great enemies to defeat no planet to save just great characters working together. Picard, Greyhorse, Ben Zoma accompany chief engineer Simenon to his home world and help him with a ritual he must face. We continue to see the developement of Victoria Wu as she commands Stargazer as they attempt to rescue a stranded starship. Ensign Nicholas learns the hardway that an Asmund sister isnt helpless. What is the mystery concerning Ulelo Dikembe? All in all an excellent addition to the Stargazer series."
3,"No bad, but there's better","There's several books with basically the same theme and roughly the same hikes - e.g. those by Alan Fisher and those by the Appalachian Trail Club. This one does have more hikes described than any other single volume I've seen, but it doesn't have enough maps or sufficiently good trail descriptions to make it a hiking ""bible"". Only recommended for those folks who've already exhaused the other available guides and are looking for more."
3,Rent it,This was another PS2 game which is very short to run the campaign. Don't get stuck buying the game with out renting it first.
1,NOT VERY FUN AT ALL!!,"this is definitely not the game you will want if you are looking for an exciting, entertaining game, which i think most people want. it has pretty good graphics, but it is pretty boring after the first hour after you have played it because all you do is the same thing, over and over and over again. i am sorry i wasted my money on this game because it was a TOTAL waste!"
2,save your hard earned cash,"this game blows chunks! don't let people kid you, this game is not worth your time. i was so thankful i rented it first. the game practically plays itself. there are better games to be bought."
1,Very boring,"I thought this was going to be like Ghengis Khan for the original Nintendo, but on a grander scale.... it turned out to be more like chess on a grander scale. The graphics are alright, the game play is lame, and the movies are pretty much the same. It's not as advertised."
2,"Beautiful to look at, not much to play at","I consider myself an average video gamer (no hardcore by any means). For some reason, I found this game incredibly hard to play. The game itself is a very beautiful game. Graphics are top notch. But like everyone else who commented on this game, that's about it. In the first week that I played this (first day just watching the history part), I was rather confused that all I did was keep hitting the X button. I couldn't even tell if I actually won the battles or if I lost them. I even bought the matching guide for it, but even the guide was confusing.As an average gamer, this is a purchase I regret."
1,Borrow it for a couple of hours. This game is lame.,"This game is definetly not for strategy game lovers. It has defined wars between 2 tribes, in which the blue tribe is better. The game doesn't allow any customization options or even level selection. It doesn't have the open end game like in AOE2 random game. There is no economical side to the game and the political side of the game is dictated.So u basically don't have to do anything except hit x to pass to the next scene. You can skip the repetitive video clips by hitting the triangle button. This game has a few good video clips but it just doesn't make up for the ... strategic design aspect of the game. This game couldn't be more poorly designed."
2,"Uhm, thats it?","I'm not an avid Koei fan, but i was very interested in trying out this title, and in less than four hours i have beaten the entire Eastern Scenario, the controls to go from map to overview to ground level and back were cumbersome for me and it wasn't nearly what i had imagined from the reviews/previews i had read. a game thats 1000x's more fun, and looks better is Dragon Force on Saturn, probably the most underrated of any system, it has so many amazing high-endthinking (rpg /stradegy) games.. soooo uhm.. Koei seemed to forget people wanted replay value and lots of time/painstaking effort in enjoying their game... both Dynasty warriors and this were less than i expected."
2,¿Que tal?This game is not fun,I got this game for xmas.Thinking that it was good I playedit.Graphics-good.Playing-boring. ...
3,"Fun, but short","I must agree with other reviewers who cite the game as far too easy to beat on the first go-through. Unless you are a hardcore strategy fan, I can't see replaying the game on the higher difficulty levels with the same scenarios. Rent it from Blockbuster and play it over a weekend; 8 hours of solid play and you'll be finished."
3,Save your cash,"Koei was and is the master of turn-based strategy games, so why have they stopped producing them in the US? This game is visually arresting, but the battle sequences leave something to be desired to gamers more used to a hands-on control of troops (from games like Starcraft, etc.) Point, click, kill isn't as fun when you are just a spectator. I grew tired of the same video sequences often replayed during battle. The game is too easily beatable, and I'd recommend rental for all the same fun, and one-tenth the price. Old school Nintendo games like Nobunaga's Ambition still have much better replay value, and once you've beaten this game, you've seen it all, and there's no increased entertainment from added play. I'd much rather a turn-based game that allows you to raise your own army as opposed to inheriting everything from the grace of the programmers. Despite all my gripes, it is still a fun game, but don't bother buying it. Rent."
3,Makes a better movie...,"Game is visually stunning. The graphics blow you away, the music is sweet, and the voiceovers are awesome. But you don't really play. You tell your guys what to do, then spend an hour (or more) watching them do it, hoping that your computer powered guys fight better than your computer powered opponent. Don't get me wrong; everyone should try it, and it is immensely fun for awhile. Just rent it or borrow it, don't buy it. If you like this sort of game, I definitely recommend going with Dynasty Warriors 2 over this one."
2,Rent it first!,"This game is probably one of the worst I've played on the PS2. There are some cool movie sequences at the beginning, but thats about it. I going to keep this short and just say don't waste your money and rent it first."
1,This game is terrible!,"I am a fan of strategy games and was really looking forward to playing Kessen. However, this game is the worst game I've ever purchased. In fact, I'm furious with myself that I wasted my hard earned cash on this game without renting it first. I personally didn't find the graphics that great, the game was too easy, and the pace was exceedingly slow. Don't make the same mistake I did, avoid this game and save your money."
2,boring!!!!!!!!!!!,When I first played this game I was excited to play it but when I did it got so boring. First of all I like strategy games but in this one all you mainly do is watch. If you like to watch how your directions and orders come out you'll probably like this game but if you prefer games where you fight and you control the characters try the game Dynasty Warriors 2 which is one of my favorite.
2,VERY BAD GAME PLAY!,"My 1st review:Yes, it is true this game may have killer vidoes... but that's all it is basicly, When you start there is a tutorial that takes about a half hour to go through, (the whole time you're pressing X and reading) then you finally get to play and you are totally confused, And you don't really do much though the whole game but watch fights so it gets old VERY fast, because its always the same.And for those people who think you can fight from a first person view in the battles that take place, just so you know you can't, and this game is for 1 player, (they could have made it two) The only thing this game really offers are good dvd films and a good sorty line. (based on true events in chinse history)So in conclusion I give this game an over-all 2 stars."
2,Good at first but too repetitive,"Graphically this is a nice game, but the gameplay becomes repetitive and boring. The cut-scenes, while visually impressive, become annoying very quickly. Also winning battles is far too easy, and there is little story line in the game."
1,What a bore...,"Alright, So i go throught Blockbuster looking for some interesting game to pop-out at me, and this cover just looks soooo Cool! So naturally the game must be! I mean with all that effort into the cover, the game has to be spectacular! Wow was I ever so wrong... The game is basically about 6 levels long and it is just about impossible to lose unless you have no idea about strategy at all. The game took me just a little over an hour to beat, which is saying a lot, cause I dont usually beat things fast. The only cool part about it was how you can use your different *forces* with different guys in sync... But, its just way to easy to beat. I guess if you just want something to make yourself feel good to say Hey! Im amazing at games! This is for you, otherwise you serious gamers out there wont appreciate it at all."
5,intro into rts,"Yes the cutscences are repeatative but look past that and u see a bland rts,not to much strategy. Iwould of liked it better if it was a simulation of war. The game is give u story,give u the plan(which u cant change),puts u into war,rince repeat. Its a pretty short rts. It is addictive and fun so that justifys the score. Good game for begginers of the generation, like me."
2,this game could have been better,this isn't really a fun game it is basically a look at how great the PS2 graphics are for one of the first games I think its ok but still thsi game isn't really worth the money get Dynasty Warriors
2,Well....I guess its OK....kinda.....sorta,"If your a stratagy lover and have patience of steel perhaps you will like this game. It has alot of history to it if your looking for a social studies lessen and decent graphics, but other than that...well...thats about it for this game, theres not to much more i can say about it."
3,Better to look at than to play,"Kessen is a beautiful game in spots. The cut scenes and battle sequences are amazingly rendered and by far are the best part of the game. On the negative side however, most of the actual game consists of you moving little blobs of color around a map. Additionally, the interface is confusing and frustrating at times, althought the game is easy enough so that you can win every battle on your first try without really doing much of anything, making any attempt to simulate a strategy somewhat useless. .. If you want a graphical showpiece for your ps2, kessen is good, but if you want a game that you can play again and again, look elsewhere."
2,Ok game...,"Ok game but the setup is very bad... If you don't have a memory card then don't buy this game... First of all the first board takes 30 minutes to get through and you don't get to do anything because it is a tutorial... So if you don't save the game you have to play the first board, and also the gameplay isn't free enough, it practicly plays itself... If you have a memory card, it's a good game, if you don't i wouldn't recomend it."
2,Home Improvement,"I have to agree with the other negative reviews I've read about this band here on amazon and by local Chicago press. Although I don't hate them as passionately, I have to agree they're music is very generic. The worst of it is the guitar player, everything he plays sounds like the opening music to the Tim Allen show ""Home Improvement"". The vocals are pretty lame as well. Check out Liquid Soul if you're looking for better quality Chicago funk."
3,Pretty damn good,"It's unfortunate that the type of music Bumpus represents is on its way out, for this album is a decent example of the genre. It is well-crafted, Yamagata's vocals are soothing, and the horns are well-timed. I can attest to prior reviewers' assertions that their impressive live shows are almost as tight as this studio effort. That's a rather impressive feat for such a young and relatively large ensemble. Some may find it hard to get past the ""nasal inflection,"" but as any native Chicagoan can tell you, it's hardly fake. This album is fun, so spin the disc and funk away!"
1,bland,"This band is BLAND. Sounds like suburban rich kid fake funk. The heart of funk is real emotion and soul, two ingredients this band lacks. Don't waste your time, I promise."
2,Poor Man's Jamiroquai,"Someone told me to get this CD because I'm a fan of Jamiroquai and they thought I would Like it. As soon as I started listening I realized I had heard it before and done better by none other than Jamiroquai. These guys need to move on and find their own sound. They sort of remind me of a bunch of guys from your office singing karoake. Overall, better than some stuff, but much worse than the good stuff. Buy the real stuff instead."
2,Heard it done better before,"This album is another example of been there done that. It feels more like a copy of a copy of a copy, rather then anything new and fresh. It is lifeless in its attempt to get funky. This band would appeal to people who like to be spoon fed and don't really care about the music that is shoved into there ears. Stick with the masters and avoid this flat piece of plastic."
1,Bumpus,"I accidentally saw this band twice and all I can say is why doit? Bumpus is a shining example of a generic Midwestern boring souless ""funk"" band. If you are interested in picking up a real funk album, anything from James Brown or Parliament kicks the hell out of this wack plastic. These guys are a poor man's Jamiroquai at best. The lyrics are self rightous and generic and the singer sings with an annoying fake nasel inflection. P U !END"
5,Fresh Funk for the New Millennium,"This CD will support the assertion that Bumpus is an exciting new band that is worth a look from any serious music lover. If you are lucky enough to catch them live, do not pass up the chance. They perform with such skill and joie de vivre that you will immediately be captivated by the great Bump machine. Buy it today."
1,... stink,"Do not get this game because the pictures look like little people running around and if you want little people running around why dont you just get legos iam telling you this game ""is bad"" so dont get it"
4,burnin love,"Roy Roberts blues style is smooth and funky, much like Johnny Rawls. This CD is has its fair share of straight ahead blues shuffles (""The Next Time"", ""Dirty Old Man"", ""That's Alright"") but the real highlight is the more soulful material like ""Burnin' Love"", ""Couldn't See the Tears For the Rain"", and the funky-blues ""Leave My Woman Alone"". Roberts is no Latimore or Wilson Pickett on vocals, but his covers of ""Let's Straighten It Out"" and ""I'm In Love"" are quite enjoyable. Overall, a solid disc by a solid soul/blues man."
4,I am impressed,"I am impressed how jewish people know what's happening and admit it, this means we still have hope the palestinians will one day be ok and take over about some of their stolen land back and give them freedom. This also shows that this war on terror is just a game for the big terrorists to keep on controlling and giving excuses to all of their deeds."
4,Explains the US Unqualified Support for Apartheid Israel,"Predident Jimmy Carter's courageous new book, ""Palestine,Peace Not Apartheid"" has gotten much undeserved fallout for its truthful telling of Israel's theft of Palestinian land as the basic cause of the ongoing Mideast Israel-Palestinian conflict. He is the first and only US politician of national stature to tell the truth to the American people about Israel faults. As an evangelical Christian with probably unsurpassed historical involvement and perspective on this conflict among US politicians, you might wonder why he is getting vilified for this important book. This book explains why. Read it---after Carter's book."
3,Review of The Politics of Anti Semitism,"Found most of the articles well written, informative and even if disagreed with opinions and ideas the presentations were professional so that one could be able to debate without getting too emotional.The one big downside is the whole book is very one sided, thus by half way one is inclined to view it as propaganda and then start to doubt the integrity of the authors - are they trying to better our world or just shove their point of view down our throats."
2,Totally unbalanced,"This is getting really old. Look, if you're going to discuss an issue as mind-bogglingly complex, and desperately important, as the Isreali-Palestinian issue, one should not blindly take sides and view this(or any)issue in black and white,""one side is Right and the other Wrong"" terms. This book puts far too much blame on Isreal for the plight of the nationless Palestinians and ignores too much historical evidience that demonstates that this assertion is simply not the entire story. Villifying Isreal and the ""Jewish Lobby,"" and conciously avoiding all other facts, as a means of addressing this problem is ridiculous, totally unfair, and quite misleading."
1,The Politics of Anti-Semitism,"I have been an avid reader and listener of the Arab-Israeli conflict for two decades. Of these many hundreds of articles and programs never once have I heard a major Jewish organization or leader call those merely criticizing Israel anti-Semitic. At the same time I have heard people like Noam Chomsky, David Duke, Amy Goodman, Robert Faurisson, Norm Finkelstein, Alexander Cockburn, Robert Fisk and their followers repeat this unfounded claim. Why would all of these people repeatidly make these false claims. Let's think about what the above people have in common and why they would create a lie about Jews calling those who merely criticize Israel anti-Semites. I assure you the above mentioned names know exactly why they have created this canard. Someone help me to figure this out."
5,Great Devotional,This book has been great for my fiance and I. Our Pastor recommended it to us when we got engaged and we love it. This devotional as really been a great relationship builder with God and with each other. Make sure you buy one for each of you as you do most of your devotional time just between you and God and come together at the end of each week and draw close to God TOGETHER.... Believe me you guys will fall in love with each other MORE and draw closer to God more... It's a great tool. Planning on getting the devotional for my brother and his girlfriend.
3,Good devotional with a slight relationship tilt,"Don't get me wrong, the devotional itself was good, but my girlfriend & I were looking for something that would be more relationship-focused. In my opinion, it was as if they took a good devotional and sprinkled in some dating-related topics. Only Week #8 on Purity had a significant relationship focused.So for those couples looking for something to start with in order to began reading the Word & praying together, I would suggest this book. For couples that already have that practice in place and are looking for more spiritual insights into your dating life, I'd recommendBefore You Get Engaged"
5,Good buy!,"I bought this for me and my boyfriend. We've been dating all throughout high school and are getting ready to go to college this year. It does a good job of dealing with some important topics, so I would recommend it for any Christian couple who want to start out doing devotionals together."
4,Great Book!,"Great book, my boyfriend is in the military and is now in a different state. This has been a great book and we are really enjoying it!"
4,Book review,This is a very good daily devotional for you and a spouse or girlfriend. It has a lot of insight and opens it up for some good conversation.
5,Couples Devotional,"I loved this devotional. It's simple to understand yet has profound truths that are the basis of our faith. I loved the questions after each chapter, makes you think of application and not just knowledge of the word and it's a great tool to discuss faith issues with your future spouse.I'd recommend it to any christian couples out there, it's a great way to build your faith together!"
5,love Love LOVE this!!,"This devotional has been SUCH a blessing to my boyfriend and I. The conversation it has given us each Saturday for our devotion time together has been amazing!! We always have great conversation, but this devotional has really helped dig deeper into our relationships with Christ, and learn how to talk about it in a deeper level together; which then makes our relationship deeper. I definitely recommend this devotional for anyone who is in a serious dating relationship!!"
3,A non-threatening primer,"My girlfriend and I were trying to find a book that would just help us get in the habit of doing devotions together and praying together, and for the most part, this book did the trick. While some of the topics covered will seem old-hat to people that have been raised Christian or been Christian for years, they sometimes serve as a nice ""refresher course"" - something every Christian needs now and then.Overall, I felt this book was very non-threatening, and a good way to accomplish the goal we were trying to meet. If you're looking for a way to introduce devotions in to your relationship without making it seem like a chore or a source of conflict, this book is a good bet."
5,Great study!,"My Boyfriend and I are almost through this study, and we have learned a lot about God, and about each other through it. It is great doing something like this together and being able to keep each other accountable. I recommend this to any dating couple who wants to grow closer to God and to each other!"
4,A good starting point for couples,"My girlfriend and I were at the 9 month mark when we started this book together. During that time the book did a very good job about covering various aspects of our spiritual lives in the context of our dating and within our personal lives. Each week was on a different topic (Prayer, Forgiveness, Grace, Purity, etc..) and that really opened the conversation more to look deeper into our personal ideas of our faith and discuss openly. The book is very basic in its content, but that's ok. It does a good job of addressing fundamental areas of our faith and has helped us understand each other better and also has been a personal help for my daily devotional life, too.Don't let the cheesy photo on the cover fool you. :)"
3,Just Okay,It was not a super good/ challenging book but good as a starter but me and my girlfriend were not married or engaged so we felt a little left out! but its better than nothing!
4,"great, but not quite what i expected","my boyfriend and i are wrapping up our last week of this book. we loved the book because it reminded us of things that we need to be thinking about in our own Christian lives, but also allowed us to grow spiritually together. we liked it because we could each do our own part during the weeks, so it was easy and we could fit it in when we each had time and on the weekends we always planned in time for us to do our devo together. i think the only thing we weren't as impressed with was that there was really only 2 or 3 of the devos that really focused on us as a couple and i guess we were maybe hoping for sometime more couple-focused instead of just sharing our own individual thoughts on that topic.overall, an excellent book to grow both individually and as a couple!"
3,"Completed with my girlfriend, a good book","My girlfriend and I did this one together. It's alright, but not great. if you're in a relationship and are looking for something to connect you spiritually with your s.other, then read this. Don't expect anything life changing though."
5,Excellent Record,This band and album are what good rock-n-roll is supposed to be about. These guys are good for the same reasons AC/DC (though they sound nothing like them) are good: the songs are pure and fun and the lyrics show off a great sense of humor. The musicianship is top notch and I'm not just saying all of this because I know these guys personally and went to high school and/or college with 2 of them and Eric is always good for sending me their Camel Cash. Buy the album and see one of their shows and you'll be hooked for life. Support these guys so they can get the recognition they deserve.
4,Very good singing,"If like me you are trying to get to know Rimsky-Korsakov's operas, then you should buy this performance. The storyline is made apparent by the dramatisation and the sound is not too bad, though you may also want to buy a more recent performance on CD. I have watched it several times and still go back to it."
3,Well acted & sung,"This is a black & white movie from the 1960s and uses a dual cast (actors play the rolls while unseen singers do the singing). This presents some minor lip-sinc problems but during the sections where the actors are not moving their lips at all, I find it quite annoying. Singing, acting, staging,& conducting are all very good. Video & Audio are very good (for the 1960s). Since Rimsky-Korsekov is not one of my favorite opera composers, I would only give it 3 stars."
5,Works Well,"My first unit went bad after a few uses but I contacted the seller and they swapped it out very quickly. What's to say other than it works pretty well. I use it on my jet ski primarily for curiosity uses, ""I wonder how deep it is here""? It shows what are supposedly fish at various depths and is a great design. Fishermen may want something bigger but for the casual user it works well."
3,First time was awesome,I took this to the lake where I usually fish. We weren't catching anything so I threw it out and it showed no fish. I moved up the bank and worked with it until I finally saw a school. We moved our gear and got our limit of rainbows in about two hours. It was absolutely incredible. The next day I took it out again and the sending unit had stopped working. It hasn't worked since. That was in June. Yesterday I ordered the rf45 sending unit. I'm fishing at a new spot this weekend (September 19) and could not stand the thoughts of not knowing. More to follow next week.
5,beautiful,"Is there a better writer out there? I cannot imagine one. Ozick is a powerful writer -- a magician, in the truest sense of the word. This short book is actually two long stories that originally appeared in the New Yorker. Both segments contain mostly the same people, but at 40 years distance. In the first part, Stella and Rosa, along with Rosa's baby, are force marched and then imprisoned as Jews by the [...]. Through a sort of fantasy, the baby is kept alive for a period of time through the use of the shawl mentioned in the title. 40 years later, Rosa is spiritually still in the camp, though she lives in Miami Beach. When asked about her life, she says it was stolen from her. I won't say anything else except to say that this is so affecting that you won't be able to read it unmoved. I highly recommend this book."
5,A disturbing and moving work,"This short work telling of the death of a child in the Shoah, and the subsequent life- destroying effect on the mother of the child is a disturbing and moving one. The symbolic 'shawl' connects the two parts of the work. It had helped keep baby Magda alive in a concentration camp, , and fifty years later the Mother Rosa holds on to as if it contained within it the life of her dead baby. Ozick's writing is brilliant especially in her depiction of the aging survivors in Miami. A note of hope enters in the figure of an elderly suitor Persky who attempts to woo Rosa back to a life of her own. But as Ozick makes painfully clear the message of Rosa's life is that what has been most loved in the past is far more real than any present or future can be."
5,Short but haunting Holocaust novel,"""The Shawl"" by Cynthia Ozick actually contains two stories. i.e. ""The Shawl"", and ""Rosa"". In ""The Shawl"", readers are taken into the nightmare of the Holocaust as experienced by Rosa, her infant daughter Magda, and Rosa's niece Stella. Rosa uses a shawl to hide her infant from detection and almost certain death, but this arouses Stella's resentment and leads to an act that proves tragic.In ""Rosa"", the story moves forward 30 years - Rosa is now a Holocaust survivor who resides in Miami, but whose past very much haunts her present. She is still clinging on to the shawl and misses her past life - the life she had before the Holocaust. There is so much anger and pain here, that one cannot help but be emotionally affected as the reader is drawn into Rosa's anguish.Though a short novel, Rosa's story is a compelling addition to Holocaust literature."
2,Dont read this book unless you have to!!,"Being that I'm enrolled in a Holocaust Literature course there was no recourse but to read this book. I would not recommend this book otherwise lol!! Although this book is about 100 pages, it reads like a 300 page novel.Initially, I couldn't discern Orzick's message. Everything in the first chapter was encoded in metaphor. When our class held discussion I had nothing to contribute besides....huh? Eventually, I sought a book by Joseph Lowin simply entitled ""Cynthia Ozick."" It broke down the metaphors for me and then suddenly the book made sense. So if this required reading for you, I suggest you read ""the shawl"" along with Lowin's book. Goodluck!"
3,Decent read...,"Cynthia Ozick's ""The Shawl"" tells the story of Jewish women, her fourteen year old niece (Stella), and infant daughter on a death march to a concentration camp. Rosa, the mother is afraid that if her infant daughter Magda is found by the Nazi officer's that she will be killed, therefore she keeps her hidden away in her shawl throughout the entire march, and much of the time that they are in the camp. Rosa's fourteen year old niece, Stella, is jealous of the comfort that Magda has with her shawl during this horrific experience. Stella decides to take Magda's shawl one day while in the camp to warm herself from the cold, thus causing her to be discovered and killed. The characters in a story may give you a sense of actually being present in the events taking place in the story.However, the section titled Rosa was a bit more confusing as one has to read in and out of her open verbal thoughts (speaking) and personal thoughts about those whom she encounters."
3,Short story; long-lasting impression,"Although the pages are few, the lingering emotion from this intimate WW 2 story is remarkable. The writing is also beautiful."
2,Nasal Spray,"Disappointed. The product shown on the picture is not what was shipped. I thought that the seller had the product that was shown. I received what I can buy in the grocery store or the local pharmacy. Apparantly the company doesn't make the extra strength spray any more. What I received was extra strength cold & sinus spray, not the extra strength spray."
3,worth the price,product was smaller than expected but well worth the price paid. Also it arrived faster than expected.
1,scary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i read this book ,and it scared me! don't read this unless you are over the age of 19"
2,Wanting to scare children is worse than peculiar . . .,"Tailypo is not a favorite childhood memory in our household. A school superintendent told this 'ghost' story to elementary students year after year after year, and the ""value"" forever eluded this mother. Why must children be unwilling victims anywhere? Stranger yet, it was published earlier by Seabury which I believe is an Episcopal press.On the other hand Joanna Galdone's 'telling' & Paul Galdone's expressive illustrations are well-done; drawings have shown off his skills to many children through the years.If you must get scary try ""Little Orphant Annie"" by James Whitcomb Riley, a stand-out of mcHaiku's childhood . . . and I would search for a copy of Paul Galdone's ""The Three Billy Goats Gruff"" (isbn *0899190359); you can insinuate plenty of scariness into your voice (if you must)."
3,Scariest picture book ever!,"I honestly can't remember much about this book, but over 20 years later I still recall that it scared the dickens out of me! Even now, I'm not sure I have the nerve to try again. There are very few things that have left an impression of being truly scary on me, but this one I will always remember."
5,R. L. Stein never scared me like this,"I remember not being able to be alone for the first 3 novemembers of elementary school, because the school librarian read this book every Halloween. 15 years later my sister and I still can't refer to the book by name. It's always ""as scary as...the book?"" and the response is always the same. "" Almost."" I can't wait to traumatize her this Halloween. Is it weird I'm nervous about having ""the book"" in my house?"
5,absolutely amazing book,My mother use to take my brother and I to the library every year at Halloween just to read this book. So I just purchased it to surprise her since she hasn't been able to find it anywhere. Maybe she can read it to her grandchildren so that they too will have scary but fond memories with my mom. I say this is a must read and a must have. Maybe not for the really small kids but definitely for the 10+ age group. Still am amazing book with a great story line. LOVE IT
4,"Good, creepy story.","As far as creepy, yet appropriate for children, picture books go, this book is awesome. Missing a star because paper back is pretty flimsy. But that only matters if you wanted it to look good on your library shelf in the ""nostalgia"" section (am 32, had this same book - though earlier printing ((same illustrator and everything)) - read to me in grade school, left an impression)."
3,art book,not what was expected but it is a helpful and insightful book for those starting art therapy
4,great!,"I love them! They keep my baby's legs so warm, he doesn't even need socks. Only thing I don't like is that you have to hand wash them and air dry. I placed a pair in the washer under ""gentle cycle"" and it still came out fuzzy looking."
4,"It's very cute, keeps the legs warm and easy to use","I bought this set for my newborn and I really like it. Its makes diaper changes easy and it's easy to slip it on the baby and quite soft. It looks adorable as well.The only thing I didn't like was that sometimes the elastic leaves marks on the baby's legs. Baby skin is sensitive and as much as the elastic is of good quality, it does leave red marks on the thigh. I tend to put baby lotion immediately. My baby didn't seem to be too bothered while wearing it but complained as I was taking it off.Other than that, I think it's really great. Also, you can use them as hand warmers when your baby grows out of it. :)"
3,looks like they shipped a second,"came with bent leg, missing bolts. Shippers did not deliver on time. On the other hand, it is just the ladder I needed, and I got it faster than most alternatives. Further, Amazon provided help in tracking down the shipment and getting it actually delivered."
2,Prime? NOT,The steaks they showed were not what I received. They were not prime and they were really thin. I would not purchase this again. :(
5,One of My Favorites,"Having been born in Idaho, I grew up with these. I absolutely love them!!! I have not lived in Idaho for years but my grandmother and aunt used to send me a box of these every year for Christmas. I guess my opinion may be a little biased because I feel a lot of sentiment toward anything that reminds me of home - but these are truly tasty. If you can find them, this company also makes small, bite-sized Spuds that are pretty good as well. I like the actual candy-bar sized Spuds better because you get more of the chocolate marshmallow flavor, but if you like the chocolate/coconut outer covering then you would probably really like the bite-sized ones a lot."
5,A Unique and Amazingly Delicious Candybar,"It's a coconut-crusted chocolate coating over chocolate marshmallow, in the shape of half an Idaho potato. Yes, it sounds strange, but if you like chocolate, coconut, and marshmallow (and it isn't truly marshmallow but a bit more jelly-like), you may just love the Idaho Spud like I do. I ate my first Idaho Spud candy bar in 1964 at age 5 at the opening of a new bank in Moscow, Idaho, and I have been enjoying them ever since. When I lived in Spokane I would buy them by the boxful at the local grocer's outlet; now I live in Phoenix, and yes, I could buy them from Amazon, but this time of year they'd arrive in a puddle of chocolate goo. So I'll wait out the summer and start buying them again, and this time I'll buy enough to last over the summer in the freezer. They freeze very well!"
5,A Must Have Book,"The Handbook on Animal-Assisted Therapy edited by Aubrey Fine is a must have book for anyone really serious about Animal-Assisted Therapy and its incorportaion into your profession. It is well written with articles by the ""who's who"" professionals currently in the field of AAT. I have been waiting a long time for this book and I'm glad it's finally here! It's worth every penny you pay for it."
3,Another good novel by a social satirist/horror writer,"Jackson certainly knew the world she lived in- and how ugly it is too! The mean grasping people, the mad, the infirm, the crazy, the malicious, the greedy ones, the envious, the whiners, they all live here in this book. Funny too! Interesting how their little minds work around the prospect of getting each other,while they try to get happiness for themsleves always at the expense of another person. Little Fancy and her mother and the mother in law, all dysfunctional we'd say today, but Jackson was too honest and clear eyed to sic a therapist on them. No, they just destroy themselves bit by bit, along with the darkly humorous satire Jackson lathers up with full suds this time. Go for it. Its funny"
4,Dark humor at the expense of the snooty,"This is a really good novel. It's too bad it's out of print.It's unlike most of Jackson's other novels -- it's more of a comedy among the upper class than her other work. Um, ""comedy"" might be misleading. I don't know how to describe Jackson's sense of humor. It's just shy of completely dark. People behave very badly. And yet you laugh.Try it!!"
5,You can't go wrong with this knife,I own several buck knives. I got my first one for my 10th birthday (over 20 years ago) and I still use it regularly. I've only had to sharpen it twice.You cannot go wrong with the Pathfinder. It is the perfect size. (probably why I had to order it online - I could never get it in stock in stores)
1,Don't waste your money,"I have had the same experience as one of the other reviewers . . . this game continually locks up on me while I'm trying to play. And, since the load times are unbearably long, it's quickly become my least favorite game to play on the ps2."
2,Falls short of other Amusement Park games...,"I was a big fan of the original ""Theme Park"" game, so I grabbed this one as soon as I got a PS2. It's not bad, but definitely falls short of other Amusement Park building sims, such as Rolle Coaster Tycoon and the original Theme Park.My biggest complaint is the restrictions in themes. Each location has its own theme. You don't get to choose the theme. You can't mix themes. I think it would be a lot more fun if you could just choose from a pool of rides and buildings like in others.The interface can also be a little awkward at times. About the only really fun part is the 3d walkthrough of the park, and riding the coasters you design. But that feature is available on far better amusement park simulation games."
1,What a horrible disappointment!,"Before buying this game, I suggest you rent it if possible. Theme Park Rollercoaster is no where near worth the price I paid for it or even 50% off. I was expecting ""real-life"", ""sim"", or ""Rollercoaster Tycoon"" like coaster game, but no. This was designed for little kids who are capable of keeping track of 30 things at once. For an adult playing this game the cartoon characteristics are annoying. Essentially, I wouldn't pay five dollars for this game. I'm selling mine, you want to buy it?"
1,most boring game ever!,"nobody should buy this. it is just absouluty boring and really *BAD* comic-like graphics. don't rent it. don't buy it. i know my grammar is bad but please take my advice don't ever rent, buy, or even glance at this game. however bullfrog does make some good games like the populous series but not this one."
2,"This game is for young, and I mean YOUNG gamers only.","The graphics in this game were good, but the gameplay was down right childish. See I'm 17, and I was expecting something close to Roller Coaster Tycoon, but its nothing like that. I'll just sum it for you : if your ages 0-12 this game is for you. If your ages 13 and up and have a PC get Roller Coaster Tycoon. But if you don't have a PC just pray that Hasbro Interactive makes RCT for PS2."
2,Disappointment around every turn,"As an avid fan of the Rollercoaster Tycoon series, I had high hopes for this game. Every aspect of this game is a disappointment. Graphics are mediocre and they betray the power of the PS2. The game play itself takes a while to get used to, and the controls are very unatural. While the intricacies of Roller Coaster Tycoon made the game exciting, the business aspect of Roller Coaster Theme Park slows down the game to an unbearable pace. When I play a video game, I shouldn't have to be a CPA to emjoy what is going on.Sim fans should stay away from this game."
4,Pretty cool game for a beginner to PS2,"I really can't describe how addicted I am to this game. I've been playing it all week and I really think it's neat. It's a good one to start with if you are intimidated by the Playstation 2. This is the first game I bought and it has really helped me get accustomed to the controller. This is pretty good since the last gaming system I had was the first Nintendo system. The first one! It's not too complicated and, although the little assistant is a bit annoying, it's an enjoyable game."
4,Kewl,"I tried this game at a friend's house.It is so much fun!She had to yank me out of her butterfly chair were I had planted it in front of the PS2! Anyone who dislikes this game was not meant to be an engineer, so just stick to your chess boards folks..."
1,theme park roller coaster,"After seeing theme park roller coaster on playstation2 , i thought it would be alot of fun , after buying the game and playing it i was very dissapointed. All parks are basically the same and all parks have similar attractions and the same shops over and over for all parks. Probably the most fun in this game , would be building and riding rollercoasters and eventually the ultimate rollercoaster ,which is very hard to build and even this becomes boring after a short period of time. Do yourself a favour people , if your after a good theme park game you cant go past Roller Coaster Tycoon on P.C it has more themes and is a very enjoyable game to play, add the expansion pack its basicaly unlimited with so much to do. My choice is easy , roller coaster tycoon , is the best theme park game available , compared to all the rest.Dont even bother buying Theme park roller coaster, consider renting before buying , that way you wont waste $$$ on a game that becomes boring within an hour."
3,A great game that gets boring,"Theme Park Roller Coaster is a really fun game. I was excited as I first put it in my PS2. Then, reality hit me. The game is great for about an hour and then you get really bored. It's the same thing over and over and over. I suggest you rent this game before you buy it."
4,"""Some Prankster has Left a Stink Bomb of f in the Park""","The game is real addicting if you like to build and create things. I will warn everyone that the little man that delivers you messages gets real annoying after he has said a thousand times ""Some prankster has left a stick bomb off in the Park, you better get a janitor over there to clean it up before the visitors get sick!"" I only know this because he only said it a thousand times through out the game. Other then the message sender it's a really fun game. I would recomend this game to girl friends that are sick of watching there boyfriends playing PS2 continously and want to make them watch you play for a change!"
2,Not for Grownups!!,"Im a 20 year old male who thought roller coaster tycoon was awsome so when i recieved ps2 this was the first game I bought. To even put the two im the same sentence is ridiculous. The ps2 version is looney and requires no actual creativity and skill. The rides are all predone for you and building a roller coaster is childs play. Although my 5, 8, and 9 year old brothers do enjoy it even though the all prefer tycoon also."
1,Gameplay Just Plain Boring,"I have this game and let me tell you, it stinks, not only because it's slow, occasionally locks up but my biggest beef is that even though you change scenarios (lands) each and every attraction is exactly the same only themed for the new land, there is no different (special) rides or attractions unique to one theme. Don't buy this game, get a pc and buy RCT"
2,Fun game when it doesn't LOCK UP!,"This is a port from the famous Rollercoaster Tycoon - Then Sim Theme Park.My only complaint is that it locks up randomly. Therefore, you need to save often, and basically reboot the system and reload the game. A big hassle considering this is a console unit, not a computer. Hopefully they will fix this in the future.On another note, I was dissapointed with the graphics. The fun factor is there, but the graphics are not."
4,A lot of fun!,"Build roller coasters, ride them, get them rated...straight-forward, family-friendly fun!The only way I could see a person being disappointed with this is if they had some mistaken expectation of what the game was. It's not action, it's not really role-playing, it's building theme parks and trying to make them profitable by having satisfied customers.It is difficult to get the best rating for a coaster, but I know I'll figure it out eventually. Currently mine are all too fast, making the kids sick, but at least they are exciting! Here's a tip (so stop reading if a tip will ruin it for you,) earn money early on using your side-shows. People will pay a lot for the side-show games as long as the chance of winning makes the game satisfying enough!"
2,Burning smell,"I baught 2 compact tops for and one of them had this Moonlight Glo Bulb, It started melting my compact top and had a burning smell...Even the ring of the bulb had brnt marks. Becareful with this product.."
2,Works... for a VERY short amount of time,"I have gone through 2 of these in less than 6 weeks. After the first bulb burned out so quickly I bought a new 75w hood from Lowe's and a new light. I run 2 - 100w bulbs during the day for my 2 red slider turtles and expected this bulb (Night Glo 75-w), along with the water heater, to provide an adequately warmed tank at night. With both bulbs burning out in less than 21 days, I am looking for an alternative. All of my lights are on timers. I've had different reptiles throughout my life and know what they need. The day lights run from 7:30am til 8:30 pm so the night lamp only has to run for 11 hours. With a less than 3 week life span, I give this product a double BOO!"
4,purple light,they do go out quickly since we use them 24/7 but does it's job...dilivered the item quick and on time!
2,It was broken,It looked good on the outside - but was broken on the inside. Haven't gone to all the trouble to return a light bulb. ): I will never buy light bulbs on the internet again.
1,Only 6 bucks and still not worth it.,Moderately difficult to charge. Full charge lasts less than five minutes. Doesnt turn right. ALways left.
4,Another great book from one of the best chefs in the U.S.!,"Charlie Trotter shares a little of his culinary philosophy and the passion that helps create some of the most innovative dishes in America. His interpretation of classic dishes, such as, Cobb Salad are beautifully prepared with step by step instructions that can be understood by cooks of any level. Most dishes prepared by Chef Trotter are completely original and innovative. The use of the freshest ingredients during peak season is one of Chef Trotter's secrets.Beautiful photography as we have come to expect from Charlie Trotter's books. Kitchen Sessions is an excellent teaching tool"
2,Difficult to follow format,"This is an ambitious cookbook , even for a good cook such as myself who normally has no difficulty following recipes. I made the meal on page127, roasted cornish game hens, and was sent to the back of the book three times for sub-recipes to complete the main recipe. I found all of this flipping back and forth very bothersome. To make matters worse, when I flipped to the back to make these ""basic recipes"" I was sent to yet another page, which turned out to be the WRONG page! Frustrating. All in all the meal was good, but definitely not worth the time and trouble. I think that this book should have been proofread more carefully, and tested more thoroughly."
4,"These books are good for ideas, but...","...don't get the impression you are going to cook like Charlie Trotter. Buying a paint by numbers book will not make you Michaelangelo, neither will buying these cookbooks make you the chef that Mr. Trotter is.Having flown this past weekend to Chicago specfically to eat at Charlie Trotter's I can tell you I have never had a dining experience like that before. And I would have considered myself somewhat jaded with regard to fine restaurants!Also, we were given a tour of the restaurant and his award winning wine cellar afterward that was awe-inspiring. We got to see where the TV show is taped as well.The books are OK and a nice reminder of the dining experience itself... But if you want the penultimate dining experience - go eat at Charlie Trotter's restaurant."
3,Homedics Citrus Air,I love the smell of this item. It makes the whole room refreshing. It is just extremely expensive for how quickly it is gone.
1,"Nice Smell, Good Unit -Rediculous Prices",These prices are insane. Your can buy this unit with 4 different scented bottles for 50$. You can use many different brand scented oils in the unit so i wouldnt spent 15$ on one refill.My Advice buy the entire unit again and you will save ten dollars or buy essential oils from somone else.
1,"Vanilla NOT vanilla scented, more like a ""clean"" scent","The machine does work great, but the the aromas are not at all as promised."
5,takes away odors,So far I have tried every scent for my Brethe Air Revitalizer and this one has to be my favorite. It masks any odors that my house might have. Living with 17 companions this makes a great addition to my home. I can't imagine living with out it.
1,Disappointed,This product smells horrible. I wonder if they use a different solution for the trial size bottles that come with the product. It literally smells like body odor. I do not recommend this product.
2,not a solution,"I wasn't happy with the humidifier/purifer or the solution. It does not humidify, and this product irritated my eyes and allergies so much I couldn't use it.To be honest, I would not recommend it."
1,air revitalizer solutions,I purchased 4 different scents. They all smell exactly alike. THEY STINK! I mean they stink BAD. They smell somewhat like the old original Lysol only worse.
1,how do i use this?,very unhappy as I didn't know i had to but another product to use this...the wrapped came off when I opened it and have no idea how to use it....Homedics BRT-s130 Calming Lavender Brethe Air Revitalizer Solution 8.46 fl oz
2,Not what I expected,I purchased it be cause I like lavender smell. While this can will last you long time it is not what I expected at all. There are no small opening for drops. Only big cap can be opened. But the biggest problem for me was it did not smell like lavender at all. The smell is more like some sort of chemicals and unpleasant at best.
2,Seems to cause unnecessary pain.,"I am currently using this for arthroscopic microfracture knee surgery. It worked fine while I was on pain pills for 4 days,and the angle was only 30. Now that I am on day 12 it is irritating me so bad I hate it. I get a weird static feeling to my skin when it is in retraction, and it rubs my thigh ad calf no matter how I adjust the thigh and calf length. If I lengthen the thigh it gouges under my knee,. If I shorten the thigh it rubs more. In addition the controller/pendant gets quite hot. This is a rental unit, and the first unit had to be replaced because it made a noise racket when going into extension. I think there is some basic design flaw."
1,Unfunny navel-gazing,"Chonda's attempts at humor are usually at someone else's expense--usually her husband's. Her audience seems too easily satisfied with her minimalist humor. Pity she doesn't stick to singing, as she has a very good voice. In all, self-absorbed evangelical candy-floss. I was very disappointed with this DVD and will not repeat my mistake in the future."
1,Can't play it in HD DVD player,"I put it in Toshiba HD-XA2 player a few times - disk format not recognized. It has HD DVD labeled, but doesn't have the HD-DVD log like other HD disc I have. Had to return it to Amazon."
5,It's performance continues to excel,"I thought I would write a short comment about this measurer, since the prior comments are a couple of years old. Suffice it to say, that the performance of this product remains as excellent as the other reviewers described. It works, and it works flawlessly. As a DIYer, I thought this unit was overkill, but after using it, I am very glad I bought it. I have cheaper model that I bought about 3 years ago, but the Stabila unit is much better. The Stabila never fails to acquire a measurement, and the reproducibility of the measurements is remarkable. I'm sure there are better models of laser distance measurers, but this Stabila unit is a great buy for the price. I gave it five stars."
5,Great price,I found this on Amazon at a much better price than I could in the store. Just wish it came in more colors. I have to make sweet tea and unsweet teas everyday so it would be nice if you had a choice in color of the lids.
1,mold,I wash this pitcher between every use. The last few times I have found mold and a foul odor around the edge of the lid. Not something I want to drink from anymore.
4,Nice pitcher - wrong color!,"I purchased two of these...they are really nice and big for those cold drinks on hot summer days. Just note, the description says white...however, the lids that came with mine are red! Not that big of a deal but odd that it says white and it wasn't."
1,"Ordered clear with white lid, got blue with blue lid","Since this product is only $8.80 it is not worth my time to send it back.I will simply donate it to Goodwill. In addition, I will never order from the seller, Better Linen & Bath, whose name is apparently an attempt at irony."
1,Item not the one pictured or described.,Item not the one pictured or described. I looked everywhere for a white one but they sent a red one. I could have got the same thing at our local store. Very disappointed!
1,Lost in a Roman Wilderness of Pain,"The snake is long. Ride the snake.The West is the Best.Father? Yes, son. I want to kill you.Mother, I want to aaaaaaauuuuuuurrrrrrgggggghhhhhh!!!!!"
5,Classic southern-fried album,"Amazing beats and lyrics. Standout tracks 2,3,9,10,11,12. The others are hot too.Pick up this one, as well as their previous album, Mystic Styles, which has a more raw sound to it.Haven't heard much of their newer stuff, but it probably ain't as good as their earlier works."
4,THIS ALBUM IS MY BEST BY THESE MC'S,"STOMP,PLUS THE SONG GLOCK IN MY DRAWS FROM DJ PAULS ALBUM...IT DONT GET NOBETTER!"
1,boring.,"like their newer stuff and mixed stuff, but this cd sucked mostly. not worth 10 bucks at all. vocals sounded like wierd montras. beats were okay on some songs. definatley not pumped up on this cd at all"
3,Why the white eagle is the badge of Poland.,"This book was originally published during World War II in Scotland, home of the Polish Armed Forces in exile. There are eleven legends in this collection. One tells of a Duke who united the tribes and helped Poland develop and grow prosperous. Once, when he tried to take her eaglets from a mother eagle, she fought him so desperately she was wounded but would not give up. The Duke made that white eagle the badge of Poland, to symbolize freedom. Her blood was the symbol of bravery. Although most of the legends in the book are new to an American reader, ""The Story of Popiel"" is reminiscent of the stories of the Mouse Tower on the Rhine. This story is much more detailed than the German one. Familiar, too, is the story of ""The Trumpeter of Krakow."" A reader welcomes a new version of these two familiar tales and is all the more eager to read unfamiliar legends that are just as interesting as the known ones."
5,Just As Good As The Charlton Heston Version!,"The Ten Commandments starring Charlton Heston is a wonderful movie but so is this overlooked movie about Moses starring Burt Lancaster who really gave a great performance. This movie may not be as glossy as the Heston version but in my opinion it's just as good and I highly recommend this underrated, underappreciated movie!"
5,Honest,"This has long been my favorite book - inside its genre, it'll probably stay that way. I love this book because it maps out a world in a honest and clear way; Mel is a multidimensional character, and so are most others. Barnes doesn't shy away from issues, (storywise) instead he does very well at explaining them as Mel :would:. It's also the somewhat utopian society he spells out. I suppose I got some of my (stubborn) ideals from this book. This worldlet's good and bad times; In a way, also because of its relevance to today, it is more realistic and personally intreagueing than most books i've read. Like the comment on the front, i parallel the writing with Heinlein even though it's a different style."
5,Great book in the style of Ender's Game,"John Barnes has created a complete, intriguing world,and he shows it to us through the eyes of a child. Wellwritten and wonderfully imagined. Full of interestingideas to play with, this is set far into the future. Thescience is real and plausible."
2,Pretty terrible,"Awful coming-of-age tale. If you are interested in an adolescent girl describing her orgasms in a science fiction setting, this is the book for you. If you are looking for solid entertainment, look elsewhere.Even worse Barnes' clumsy and cliched ""A Million Open Doors""."
4,"Enjoyable, classic SF reminiscent of Heinlein","This book is a worthy addition to the sub-genre of SF which focuses on the young man or woman growing into themselves within a new frontier of space. It stands well alongside books like Heinlien's immortal ""Have Space Suit, Will Travel"" and ""Space Cadet,"" Or Clarke's ""Islands In The Sky."" I have found it to be entertaining, stimulating and as good as anything written in SF in the past 5 years. Anyone who enjoys this particular sub-genre will enjoy Orbital Resonance immensely."
4,Good early work by John Barnes,"If you're a fan of John Barnes and haven't read this book, it's about time you did. This book, more than any other, to me establishes his style of thinking, plotting, and writing.The story is engaging; the characters are well-drawn; the setting is imaginative.One of the things I like best about John Barnes is his ability to write science fiction novels that are actually about people the reader can identify with and care about, and Orbital Resonance is a good early example of that ability."
4,"Good Plot,nice Characters, Somethig missing...","I start with this is a good book, not the best and not a must reader. But if you like Scifi at all this book is good. And it is true that he wrights like Robert Heinlein(the in your face way). I was not aware of this book being in a series, that just what i think it needs. What i have seen looks to me as if the second is not all that good, but this first book was not bad and even good so i will try the second one and get a review on.Hypno signing off3.6 Stars for Orbital Resonance"
5,Good Debut,"This album came correct, skinny had never sounded this great this and will probably not again. If you like 3-6 or skinny pimp u should buy this. The rest of his albums dont match to this,the beats are bumpin too mainly cause it was produced by Paul & Juice. Check out songs like ""Ya'll ain't no killaz"" ""I don't love em"" and ""All about them prophets""."
5,Great live session from one of the best electronic live acts,"If you like dance music, you are going to love this CD. The final track; ""Rez/Cowgirl"" justifies this investment big time. What a perfect remix...I am still playing Rez/Cowgirl in parties and the crowd always gets crazy. This CD is definitely a must buy."
5,Underworld making classics outta classics,"Simply awesome. If you're a long-time Underworld fan, you'll love this album and, as is the case with most live albums, you'll probably be able to appreciate these cuts more than someone new to them for the plain fact that you'll have the history of these cuts replaying in your head as you listen (remember the first time you heard ""Pearl's Girl""?) I love the mix of ""Juanita"" on here, OMG. This is simply a great mix of Smith, Emerson, and Hyde's talents. I can't wait to get the DVD; I NEED to see their live show!"
5,Better than the studio albums,"Having every underworld song on albums and singles, I thought there was nothing more to hear from Underworld. Well it turns out that this album is the best one yet. I would rather listen to the versions of songs on ""everything everything"" than on their original albums. This is truly a disc to own, especially if you've heard all the songs before. They're done with more energy, Hyde's vocals sound cooler, and Emerson mixes in some great techno bits that are exclusive to these live versions. Pick this one up for sure."
5,I can't say enough good things about this band,Underworld are great. I love to smoke and watch their home video. They can tear it up live. Your endorphins will arise and swim in the beats.
3,Decent techno,"I tend to like up beat bubbly techno to dance to. This had some good stuff, but I should've paid attention to the fact it was live. Oops."
2,I must have missed it,"Before buying this CD I had never heard Undeworld before but they came recommended by one friend who has turned me on to lots of good music such as Orbital, Kid Spatula, BT, and Moby.This must be one of those CD's where you had to be there. At the concert that is - in order to appreciate it. My first gripe is that the sound quality is lousy. The second is that while there are high points, there are many low points that are boring.My guess is that if you are familiar with their music and you have heard them live, you might like this CD. However if you fit neither category approach this CD with caution. Anyone want to buy a slighty used copy?"
5,A tour de force!,"I'll admit, I'm biased to electronic music. Underworld has made a phenomenal live album with this CD. It contains some of their best-known tracks like Res/Cowgirl and Born Slippy.nuxx. The energy of the live album VS a studio album can really be felt in this CD. I can't stop listening to it."
3,Actually 3 1/2 stars. Should have been a double.,"This should have been a double CD. I have a two disc live set they played in Hamburg I got from Napster. To me that is the real live CD. Yeah they reworked tunes on that play also. That's what they do live. This Cd serves well as another document to repetroire of live Underworld and is therefore very worthy of your collection. There are some sparkling moments here but I felt overall the editing on the CD was a little strange. Like they were trying to cram in as many different tracks as possible before the 75 min. time limit was up. Should have been a 2CD! It takes away from the intensity of the music. However, I'm expecting the DVD will be twice as long and a beautiful production. I've never seen UW live so I am grateful to the techno-gods for granting my wish on DVD. Depsite the shortcomings, this CD will snuggle into my 300 player right next to the Hamburg recordings. Underworld is incredible."
5,great my highest rating,Michael Deangelis has an amazing voice I know my music and his voice is just great. The band that plays with him (Hoar of the Dog) is great too Both this album and all Hair of the Dog's albums have my highest recommendation.
5,sexy and comfortable,"I bought this boot in black. It's sleek and attractive, but the heel is low enough that I can wear the boot all day. Perfect for work! I found that this runs true to size."
2,Not true to size,"I have a pair of Kenneth cole boots and they were the same size that I ordered. However, these were so big I had to send them back. They did not have a smaller size for me. They were nice to look at, but I believe something was wrong with the sizing."
4,Social history At Its Best!,"Get a taste of the 1930's with this winning review of Louis /Smelling & much more.The author can write and certainly did lots and lots and lots of research. More important than Jackie Robinsons'baseball triumph, Louis'Lose and later victory brought America to an important point in bettering race relations.There is quite a bit of star studded name droping at ringside, most of whom the 20th Century historically deficient reader may not recognize.The author sometimes assumes the reader is familiar with a hundred phrases, terms and names such as Neville Chamberlin,Etheopias plight,CCC,Leni Reifenstal, and ""brownshirts"",though He briefly clarifies some of these at least once.Well worth reading.!"
2,Not enough about boxing as a sport.,"Sorry to say, but I did not care for this book. I was well aware of the history of the Louis/Schmeling boutsand I thought this book would have spent more time talking about the actual two bouts. It did not.I have now read Roger Kahn's ""Dempsey"", Jack Cavanaugh's ""Tunney"", and Jeremy Schaaps's ""Cinderella Man"",as well as this book, ""Beyond Glory"".........and Max Baer cited constantly in all these books. Somewriter should write a book about Max Baer. He sounded like a great guy."
5,Excellent music,"I, too, bought all of the Highwaymen albums in the 1960's, and I still have them but othing to play them on! My only complaint is that they did not re-release the other albums on CD as they did their first two. I especially enjoyed the songs that they played in French and Spanish."
5,Excellent and funny music.,"Want to get happy...get this Music love, love, love it. Some songs have humorous adult themes, so don't play around prudes."
2,"Not what I expected; not the Johnny Cash, etc. group.",How can two totally different groups have the same name? This group I never heard of. I thought copyright laws protected against this.
2,"looks well made Intermatic FF60MC 60-Minute Spring Loaded Wall Timer, Brushed Metal","this switch worked in my garage for about a month , then hangs up at zero. needs more spring tention. I have replaced this switch with a solid state timer"
3,Switch works well but is not metal,"I bought this switch to have a timer on a bathroom fan and also to match the existing metal electrical plates. This item was described as having a color of ""Brushed Metal Finish"" - which is not inaccurate but a bit misleading. The base of this switch is plastic made to look like metal and it looks better in the picture than in person. While it's not bad looking it really doesn't look well next to real metal. Having said that, it was easy to install, shipped fast and works well."
2,"Mechanically sound, Aesthetically disgusting.","I'll say that I wish the implementation of the device were different; I wish it were an up-down sliding switch that wound the mechanical timer.Most people use these for heaters and exhaust fans, in bathroom applications. I've heard about them used on saunas and tanning units too. I wanted to use them in a more robust capacity, and in a way that most people wouldn't.I wouldn't use them for the normal reason people buy them, though, either: The sound they make is awful, it's a constant ticking sound, for the entire duration of the time-set. Why couldn't they have made these silent?"
5,imediate relief,"What a great little design that fits into your pocket just like a chapstick. No matter how stuffy I get, those Vicks vapors clear me right up allowing me to use my nasal spray to keep the airways clear. There are two things you should definitely avoid with this product. First, you should not over use the inhaler, as it will cause nasal irritation. Second, you should store the inhaler at room temperature because if it gets too hot the vapors will be stronger and also cause nasal irritation. The only other concern is that this product has an ingredient that will show up as an amphetamine on a drug test. So, you should keep the card with you if your boss gives you a drug test. If you follow these guidelines, then you'll see this product is a real lifesaver when you're all stuffed up."
5,This product gave me the best relief that ...,This product gave me the best relief that I've ever gotten for my congested sinuses! Got my son one -- and he got immediate relief too.
4,I found the Vicks Vapor Inhaler to be ...,"I found the Vicks Vapor Inhaler to be a great alternative to nasal decongestant sprays. The Vicks name in itself is reassuring, as I've come to trust their products. I like the soothing vapors of the inhaler, which come from camphor and menthol. They provide me with instant relief from my stuffy nose without over-medicating me. This product is easy to carry and easy to use."
1,Not Proctor and Gamble,"I bought this product under the assumption it was the ""real"" Vicks Inhalor but when I received them from out of the country, I soon realized they are a generic product. :(."
3,Vicks Vapor Inhaler worked well to help clear ...,"Vicks Vapor Inhaler worked well to help clear up my nose, but it had a somewhat unpleasant smell. I wouldn't use it again and wouldn't run out to tell all my friends about it. I don't know if it had any advantages over similar products, because I've never tried anything similar to the inhaler."
4,Not bad but not great,"If I could have given it 3 1/2 stars I would have but I rounded it to 4 because I feel nice.Likes:*Compact*Easy to use*Works well enough*Wont leave you feeling like you want to dry heave like some sprays can if you have a weak stomach like meDislikes:*Not as effective as a nasal ""spray""*Could be mistaken for a ""spray""*The cost probably doesn't justify what it is.*You could probably make a home made one for less cost. It is a small plastic sized finger with some vicks vapor rub in it except probably in powder form."
3,This product was easier to use and carry ...,"This product was easier to use and carry with you than the typical nose spray, but I didn't feel the product worked as well. The stuffiness returned sooner than with the typical nose spray products. I'd buy it, since it's easy to carry and use."
2,"I like it, but for the wrong reasons.","Whats great about Vick's Vapo Inhalers are that they smell nice, are a little soothing, and they easily fit in any pocket.The problem however is that they can't and/or don't work the way I expect them to.A stuffy nose is due to swollen membranes in the nasal cavity. If you're COMPLETELY stuffed up, then you can't even inhale the product through your nostrils to work. This is flaw #1 as you can't use a nasal product if you can't even breathe in or out of your nose.The 2nd reason for me that I'm not impressed by the product is that if I'm only partially stuffy, the product DOES NOT reduce any inflammation at all, at least not in me, and even if it could, the effect is only temporary on levels of only a few seconds. Not even a minute later, I'd be right back to stuffy levels.I like the product because of it's portability and smell and may buy it again because of that, but its not any solution to my nasal congestion problems."
5,GREAT book!!,"This book was excellent! I loved every bit of it and didn't want to put it down from page 1. The struggles of all the women of catawba were so interesting and wonderful to read. Right after finishing it, I picked up the sequel so I could keep reading into the Marston's life. If you see this book, please buy it and the sequel because they are worth every penny!!"
2,Had to return shoe,"This was my third pair of Skechers and I loved the first two pairs, bikers, and had great hopes for this pair, but after two attempts to wear them, I had to return them. But first I compared the length of the Velcro strap to the length of the strap on the Skecher bikers, and it was an inch shorter. I really need that inch, because these would pop open when I walked. They won't stayed Velcroed throughout the course of my day. So now I am nervous about buying another pair of Skechers mail-order without knowing how long the strap is."
4,HEY,yo richelle they are like so big right now they used to just play at the u-turn and then now they are going to the warped tour and just growing
2,Undistinguished,"Shakespearean criticism has many brilliant works that span the centuries and retain their value for current readers; unfortunately this is not one of them.Gregory T. Lombardo MD, PhD"
1,Severely Warped LP,"Couldn't listen at all to the record because it was so warped and the needle doesn't get a grip on the grooves at all I received it wrapped well and in a timely manner, I just wish I could listen to it. Should I put a penny on my stylus or any other suggestions?"
5,D-E-Licious!,"I was very impressed with the quality and flavor of these candies. The cute ""bee"" packaging is also a plus. I would definitely purchase these candies again in the future."
4,honey queen bee,These candies are very good. The honey inside is a nice honey filling. I use these candies in my work candy jar. THey go very fast.
3,Candy,Candy was okay. I like another selection better. this had very little honey taste. Order was prompt. I really don't have any other words to write. the candy was okay but nothing to write home about.
2,Cup Half Empty,"Per Amore is dissapointing for those wanting classical or regional favorites of love. The CD starts with this promise and does it well, but the many latter recordings are permiated with the current pop vocal formula. The creshendos are not emmotionally beleivable, the octive drops too frequent and accessible. The direction of the music seems more driven by new market considerations than Andrea's heart."
5,"""Best Of"" Album From the Greatest Unknown Artist Ever","I have everything Frankie Miller ever released and although my list of his ""Best Of"" would be a lot different than what is on this album, it is still a 5 star album. He is that good. All the basics of Frankie's music are here covering most of his albums. For those that haven't heard Frankie, I always described him as a cross between Rod Stewart and Bob Seger but with his own distinct sound. Some are bluesy others more rock, some that have a country sound, and many great ballads. He is one of the all-time greatest voices and was an in-demand song writter. Outstanding combination. Absolutely 5 stars for this album."
4,This is a classic.,"I'm writing this review because the only other customer review gave it a one star rating. Clearly, the book did not meet that reviewer's needs.I do, however, want to alert graduate students and teachers and mental health professionals to Stone's book. Published in 1993, it is now far too old to be a primary text on personality disorders. And the fact that it uses DSM-III-R diagnostic criteria makes it even less palatable to students.But I thought that the book was superb when it was published, and I still recommend it to graduate students in clinical psychology for its discussion of psychopathy and of personality traits that are difficult to treat.Graduate students in clinical psychology should first learn about Robert Hare's work on psychopathy, but Stone's book is a great resource."
1,Mental disorder with personalities changes.,"I have a friend that her daughter has MPD switiching into seven defferent people within their own mood changes, good and bad. Would like to know how commom is this disease?Would like to know more about the MPD. Whom to talk to, Doctors, hypnotherist, whomever that can give some insight on MPD Thank You John"
2,thanks professor ...,"This is the first book I've read on the topic after a few days getting a feel for RDF through web resources (W3C et al). I'm a nocive for sure, but have experience with XML/XSD and I'm an accomplished programmer / developer. This isn't a ""Developer's Guide"".Though the author shows mastery of the topic and makes excellent points that have helped me in design issues, the general text is hard to read and hard to folow. This may speak more to my (lower than average?) reading skills but frankly I'm not sure. If I were well versed in RDF this may be a good book for opening academic discussions, but it's a bad read for beginners (and I'd consider myself a rather advanced beginner)."
2,Okay but confused,"This book is okay but needs work. It has neither good examples of RDF or programming with RDF. A better background to RDF, more examples, and better explanations are required."
3,It works,"I bought a '99 Grand Marquis and ran into the space problem. The alternative to this small console was a bench seat console for 75 dollars. I had to do some modifications (cutting) to this console to make it work. They should provide some attachment mechanism to it. It will slide all over. Other than that, it is a good alternative to very expensive stuff."
1,Poor Buy,This is a very flimsy console. Drinks fall over and console itself will fall off the hump in car on every turn. I have already thrown mine in the trash.
4,raise your hand if you love horses,i am a big fan of pat parelli.i enjoy most everything i've read from him and his wife linda.
5,Amazing program,The only way to be with horses. This book is an easy read with great insight into horses. A must have for any horse owner!
1,Not the real story,"I was disgusted by how this writer tried to make what was already horrid into something even worse by interviewing a few people and making what they said sound like it represented the entire town, county, and state. I'm a former newspaper editor and I was appalled by this book (and the other one, also). My mother was on the jury."
2,"The Story that Didn't Need To Be Told, Again!","My family sent me the book to me here at colege at SMU in Dallas, Texas. I was very frightened when I read it. I didn't need to know more details about the terrible people who committed the murder of James Byrd, Jr. We needed to put that murder behind us, heinous as it was and not dwell on it but heal from the murder. Now I find it unthinkable that someone would sensationalize and market and profit from a book that the family of Mr. Byrd. For one thing, I pray the proceeds went to the family as they need it, much more than the author who wrote it would."
2,I wonder,"Got this book from the library and I thought it was good reading. However, I've never been to Jasper but have been thru Vidor on Interstate 10 quite a few times and it certainly is not norhtwest of Jasper as the hardback version I read said on page 142.Check out a map of Texas. Also on the same page it says Vidor was named after King Vidor the movie guy. Search for Vidor Texas on the Internet for info on how this place got its name. Also on page 16 I think instead of Highway 59 it should be highway 63. Other discrepancies I missed? I wonder."
4,Great Piece of Work,"I typically would not write a review, but having grown up in Jasper I felt compelled to applaud the author for this book. Temple-Raston does an excellent job of capturing the underlying attitudes and perceptions that many people felt following this crime. She captures information from all sides, giving a true picture. History and other events are intertwined with the main storyline in just the right mixture, providing the reader the necessary background.The only thing that may detract from the credibility of the story was some obvious mistakes in geographical references. The author and editors should have caught many of these. But these will go unnoticed by readers not familiar with the area.Overall, Temple-Raston has taken this nationally covered event and presented it in a manner allowing everyone to understand the struggles that still exist today."
1,Totally offensive,"It doesn't need a genius to figure that the book is only a sort of a revenge for the 12 years the author had spent in Saudi. The language varies from sarcastic to humiliating. And it's obvious that the story sums and magnifies most evil that can exist in such community, and then spices it up with some lies. The book is too offensive and indecent."
5,Wonderfully fun!,fun stuff. makes for an interesting image. You never know what you're going to get. On time and great condition.
4,sketchy but thought-provoking,"The two short essays collected in this book serve to complement Bookchin's history of anarchism in Spain leading up to the revolution, titled ""The Spanish Anarchists: Heroic Years 1868-1936"". These essays do not serve as a proper overview on their own of what happened in the anarchist movement in Spain in the years of the revolution, for a capsule version of that history I recommend checking out sections of Martha Ackelsberg's ""Free Women of Spain"", or the section in Guerin's ""Anarchism: From Theory to Practice"". For an in-depth history, check out Broue and Temime or Bolloten's The Spanish Civil War. But Bookchin does draw out some important lessons here about anarchist organization, leadership, charisma, and bureaucratization, and the havoc wreaked by Stlainist influence on the revolution. For those interested in the topic, Vernon Richards' ""Lessons of Spain"" is another good source."
4,Liar's Club Hoodie,"Great heavy-weight quality goods, only one remark: they come out rather large, so it's best to order 1 size smaller than your actual size!"
4,Summer help,I ordered this book to use with my kids over the summer. It's an easy to use format...a mini lesson on each page and usually 12-15 problems. Kids can spend just a few minutes each day reviewing skills so they don't lose ability over the summer. This book has been working perfectly for us.
4,Short video-16 Mins,"This video, although short, contains perhaps the best songs (4) that Whitesnake ever recorded in the early 80s: Fool For Your Loving (1980), Don't Break My Heart Again (1981), Here I Go Again (1982), and Guilty Of Love (1983).No one could ever accuse this band of being insensitive to women!!"
2,Wasn't drawn in by the characters,"As others said. Typical romance, mediocre. Underwhelming.I realize that I don't like main characters who have problems expressing love (and here we had 2 of them). I'm sure the storyline appeals to some, but books I truly resonate with are the ones where the characters are warm, loving and involved. Or even if they are anguished, as were these 2, they are still aware of their hearts and yearnings. People I could see as being my own friends. Cat, the older sister, had some of that, but on the whole there was too much mental ""steeling"" and not enough openess. That was really the characters' struggle (so the author achieved her goal), but I guess I don't like either living it or reading about it. Give me a book that pulls my heart strings any day."
2,typical women's fiction,"The good:The writing is clear and evocative without being fussy.The bad:38 is old. Okay. Gah.Two sisters in their 30s with preternaturally understanding long-term boyfriends can't commit because their father left their mother, ergo All Men Leave. I'm rolling my eyes here. Get over it already.I hated all the characters.The verdict:Basically a typical women's fiction story, which reminds me why I loathe this genre in general."
2,A great Disappointment visualy,"I expected from Readers Digest some clear images digitaly done as mentioned on their cover , but in effect especially Pearl Harbour is avery poor example of quality footage . To be honest their are two discsand I have only viewed part One , and I am in no hurry to look at Part Two . I have seen enough of very soft images and running scratches todo me for quite some time . I respect greatly what the American ServiceMen and civilians had to do during the war , and the sacrafices involved .If you are going to tell their story , they deserve much better than this ."
5,A n important song from an important historical moment,"This is the Fatima Mansions best song by far. Doesnt fit into any one niche, which is probably why they didnt do well in the USA. Not to get nostalgic about how the end of the Cold War came about (Romania, Bulgaria...), but this song hit the spot when it came out. Still one of my favorites. It has a kind of bouncy roughness, plus a great closing sample form David Lynch's The Elephant Man: ""sounds like something out of a dream"""
3,NOT Advanced D&D!,"Buyers Beware! This is NOT the ADVANCED Dungeons & Dragons manual, as is stated in the title description above. It is in fact a very simplified version of the BASIC Dungeons & Dragons manual. It is not in hardbacked book form, but comes in a box with some flimsy paper rulebooks. Which is all OK, but note that these rules are clearly aimed at people - children, in fact - completely new to D&D, indeed to the whole idea of roleplaying games. If, like me, you were looking to start generating your own characters with some new players, you won't find those rules in here. All the characters are pre-generated and are somewhat middle-of-the-(ancient cobblestone)-road. Still, it found some use: for my two younger siblings (six and nine), who found it was a fun starting point!"
5,Exactly as it was in 1999.,"I bought this from a bookstore in 2000. I was very small so I naturally almost completely destroyed it.So, to regain some of my lost childhood, I purchased this ""new"", which of course means still in the plastic wrapper.I gleefully tore that asunder to reveal the delicious AD&D-Lite; that was within.Plastic TSR-dragon branded dice bag, a set of polyhedral dice, rulebook, adventure book, pregenerated characters. Everything you could possibly need. For an afternoon or three anyway."
5,"Healthy, Happy Hair","I have really fine hair and I love this stuff as a pre-shampoo hair treatment. After using it my hair feels moisturized and sleek. While the label says you can use it as a styling aid, I find the smell a little strong and the product a little greasy for this usage.I also like that it's cruelty free."
5,Avocato butter,I love this product. It helps keep your hair healthy and nourished. It's part of my daily routine. It is just hard to find in stores now.
5,Perfect,"Lucy Irvine is a deeply underestimated author,perhaps because of her exotic and unsettled life. Her examination of the culture of Pigeon Island is extraordinarily sensitive. She is unsparing and intense in her search for the truth that underlies the Hepworth's relationship with the inhabitants of this Pacific corner and, by extension, all cultures with an unknown counterpart. Lens-like,she misses nothing that is humane or fragile or beautiful. This was my favorite book for a very long time. For a while,Irvine was living in a remote corner of Scotland and now appears to be living in the Balkans.Whatever comes from her pen next is sure to be remarkable."
2,Blues should hold his head in shame!,"I went and order this before it was released. Waited in anticipation for another masterpiece like ""Plaid"" or ""Hairpick"" But NO! you can`t hear Blues play for some guy singing all the way thru so if your looking for Blues Saraceno,don`t look hear."
5,Alpha Centauri is sooo addictive it should be illegal,"This is without a doubt the game to end all other games. Once installed, you will not want to, or need to play anything else. I have lost years of my life to this game. In fact do not buy it, if you want to have a life too. Alpha Centauri will assimilate you completely. For more civ reviews: http://www.otterit.co.nz/games/games.htm"
5,Exciting and Engaging,"A friend let me borrow a demo cd with this game on it when I was thirteen. For two years I was addicted to this game until I got a new computer and no longer had the demo. Unfortunately I was only playing the demo so did not get to play all of the characters or go the whole game through so finally, at age nineteen, I stumbled upon the game here on Amazon and must say that the full version is double the excitement of the demo. It has a few new characters and a few missing ones from the demo. Two of my favorite factions ""the progenitors"" and ""the nautilus"" were cut out of the full version of the game that I have so I was dissapointed there but otherwise this is a very engaging game that I reccomend to anyone interested in colonizing their own new world and fighting for it against other very unique and objective driven factions with their own different personalities."
2,Don't believe the hype.,"Certainly, this game is by one of the best teams in the 4-X business, and it does have some wonderful innovations. HOWEVER, it is crippled by the decision to include Planet as a non-removable, non-controllable player. Even playing the greenest game possible, I find myself reaching a point near the endgame, where rather than savoring my impending victory and polishing my civ to near-perfection I am forced to a hurried ending. Why? 'Cause Planet doesn't like me, and 30-unit stacks of Mindworms start turning my cities to goo. Yay. How fun. This is the very definition of an addictive, stunning game that's crippled by poor implementation of (what could be) a clever idea - the idea of a semi-sentient ecology, capable of protecting itself. Too bad that ecology is ""magic"" and has unlimited units to crush whatever offending city it wishes, never mind that, compared to you, every other faction is an eco-hitler. Save your money, buy Civ2."
2,A Disappointment,"The reviews of this game looked great and I've enjoyed Civ I, II, & III. Unfortunately, there was not anything new or interesting in this game. I found the ""alien"" technology difficult to understand and stragetise. Civ III is much better. I am very glad that I did not pay full price for this item. If you have already played Civ III, do not bother with this game."
2,Just Another War Game,"I had anticipated more building, more great projects such as in the Civ games. Basically, you spend all your time making a bigger war machine than the Joneses. Diplomatic relations are simple, boring, and moot, as the real goal of the game is that you have to conquer everyone else before being able to live peacefully... and then there's nothing to do. I regret I shelled out 40 bucks for this game that's collecting dust."
4,Great Game for Turn-Based Game Lovers,"I really liked playing this game. Even though it was made about 10 years ago, the graphics don't take away from the great gameplay and concepts. I really suggest getting this game if you like scifi and turn-based games"
4,"Great Replay, this is one of the original Turn based stratagy games.","while the graphics are not that advanced it is still one of the best turn based strategy games available, the different cultures each have an individual feel to them and the advancement is both fast and enjoyable."
4,It gets better the more you play it,"My first few games of Alpha Centauri did not overly impress me. The gameplay was slow on my computer, the tech tree wasn't as interesting as Civilization and the ecological storyline wasn't compelling to me. The game was good enough to keep at, though, and now that I have a faster machine the game is much better paced. Once you pick up the tech tree the game makes far more sense. Letting the governor run your cities is anathema to many players but I experimented and have found the AI to be fairly solid and you can let the AI governor run your cities and you can just keep an eye on them while concentrating on achieving your goals be they militaristic, technological or economical. I do like the various ways victory can be achieved. It adds variety and winning economically provides a challenging diversion after playing a ""conquer-the-world"" type of game."
3,Fun for a little while,"I love racing games but am a little disappointed with this one. It was fun for the first 10 minutes but soon got both boring and aggervating after that. Maybe I just ..., but it's easier to simply pass the other bikers than to try to hit them. Trying to hit them always slows me down. The graphics are pretty good, and overall it really is a fun game, but you're go so fast that it's hard not to crash into things a lot, and then when you're running back to your bike, sometimes people run you over and you find yourself cussing at little video game men. So if you're a person (like me) who gets ticked enough to just about smash the Gameboy against the wall, then this isn't the game for you. Also, it's not really that big of a deal, but it ... how you have to enter a password to get to where you last finished, because the game doesn't save that sort of thing for you. But overall, this is an okay game."
3,Good,"Good watch, however all the batteries in the BIG AL watches are dead. Therefore when you purchase it.....a new battery will be needed."
4,wicked cd,"this cd has great songs, is the type of cd that i would love to put in my car, with full volumen before going to a massive exciting party, the first song is one of those songs that drug your senses without doing any harm to your body."
4,Trance Mix by Blank and Jones,"Overall i think that this CD is a pretty good mix of different forms of trance. Like all mixes it comes with the good and the bad. The first half of the CD is more light trance, kind of an introduction per se. For the most part the second half is faster, and harder...great for clubbing and dancing! Im impressed with Blank and Jones after this CD, they did a pretty good job. Id probably stay away from some songs such as Cygnus X ""Superstring"" and Delerium Feat. Sarah McLachlan ""Silence"". But other songs like RBA ""No Alternative"" and Comsic Gate ""Exploration of Space"" are awesome. And how could you forget ""Blood is Pumpin"", its a great one, hard NRG at its best (well, almost). Id definately advise people to go and buy it."
5,Awesome,This is a classic release from Prophet Entertainment. Theres no track on this CD I skip. It bumps from beginning 2 end. BUY NOW!!!!!!
5,Foever one of the greatest,"Gangtsa blac is one of my favorite rappers. He has a real tight flow, he talks about the real in his live and whats around him, and his beats are so off the hook that there the krunkest i eva heard. Can it be is my favorite cd by him and my favorite song is powder. powder is soo krunk that when i bump it in my car and pull it to the curb, folks just start dancin. 3-6 needs tha let him rap on they new tapes so people can hear him everywhere instead of just underground. peace......."
5,DJ PAUL & JUICY J AT THERE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"BY FAR THE SICKEST BLAZED BEATS EVER MADE. DJ PAUL AND JUICY J HAVE OUT DONE THEMSELVES ON THIS CD NEXT TO LA CHAT/MURDER SHE SPOKE ALBUM. THEIR OLDER ALBUMS ARE THE BEST COMPARED TO THEIR NEW ONES LIKE CHOICES 2, DA UNBREAKABLES, EXCEPT FOR FRAYSER BOY ME BEING ME. THAT CD WAS SICK TOO."
3,necessary evil,"I had ordered a wall fire place and my choices for fuel were limited. I had read the reviews on this product and while they were not 5 star went with it because it was the only one that didn't give off a fuel smell. That's the upside to this. They function for the job intended but the shipping time is way too long. I believe it took over 5 weeks to get the product and it was not back ordered. Fortunately for me, the quantity I ordered will last a long time, as I use the fireplace for effect only. Hopefully when I run out there will be other products offered to do the job."
3,other stuff is better,Stick with the better know gel-fuels....(don't play dumb--you know the ones I mean...) This brand does't burn as long--mostly because the cans aren't full! ALL of these gel fuels are so outrageously priced; you'd think they were made out of unicorn blood! There are 'recipes' on the internet that tells you how to mix your own--and it's a lot cheaper than buying these--and you get the same burn! Start using your fireplace again & mix your own!
1,STANKY!,"I am envious of all the reviewers who smelled no odor, because I thought I was going to asphyxiate both myself and my dogs with the strong burning alcohol smell. I will say, however, that each and every can was badly dented when the box arrived, so I don't know if that had anything to do with interfering with the chemistry of the gel or altering the way it burned. Either way, I'm not curious enough to order more and find out."
1,Incredibly disappointing,"First of all, this isn't a book; at 44 pages it's a bound pamphlet. Nowhere is this disclosed nor the fact that the ""book"" was originally written in 1914, with the third (and last edition) revised in 1916. Second, it doesn't cover the wars at all; it's a superficial treatment of the background to the first war with a total of 3 (!) pages alloted to the description (if it could be called that) of the war itself. Similarly for the second war. Finally, it's an amateurish reprint at best. For example, no maps are shown, just a tag where the map would have been shown along with a caption. For example on page 42 the following is listed: ""[Map: map3.png Caption: The Balkan Peninsula after the Wars of 1912-1913.]"". I suppose the publishers didn't realize that they needed to insert the map rather than the caption.At $ 20.00 this is a first class rip-off."
5,Convenient way to Save Energy,"Set it on and go away to work, play, whatever knowing that the fan will only run long enough to purge moist or stale air from your bathroom, then stop to save energy. Good to dry out bathroom to prevent mold. Built strong. I buy one for everyplace I live and have used them for years."
1,"poor quality, dangerous",Poor Quality. In less than 6 months the timer would get stuck at the 15 minute mark and bathroom fan would run indefinitely completely defeating the purpose of the timer. Overpriced junk. Do not buy>
2,Fatal Lack of Built-Up Suspense,"David Wiltse's John Becker thriller, BONE DEEP, tries to be more character-oriented than it really should. As before, Becker makes for one of the most intriguing characters populating suspense novels today, yet the story itself is a dog. Captain Luv is an uninteresting creation, never really eliciting much in the way of danger or dread, so the anticipation of Becker's eventual clash with him dissipates after about 100 pages or so, and all we're left with is wondering how long it'll take Becker to stop the ludicrous 'jealosy' subplot and unmask this dreary killer. Starts off rather well, with good pacing and interesting forensic detail to latch onto, but the narrative veers off course way too many times and the overall product is dense and flabby"
3,Starts out good...,"This is the first (and probably NOT the last) David Wiltse book I've read - I'll probaby read some of his other Becker books. This book started out pretty good - kept my interest and moved along quickly. Then, about 50 pages til the end, it just started to get boring. I had the 'villian' guessed halfway thru the book, it was that predictable. But, I liked the Becker character and his FBI-boss Karen. I will most likely read other books by this author."
4,John Becker strikes again,I have all the novels with John Becker as the main character. They are all very good if not excellent. Why Wiltse does not write anymore? Is he dead? That would be a great loss.
1,Horrified,"This book was very biased against George Bush and I do not believe what the author is trying to do. His writing is ok, I guess, but content leaves a lot to be desired. I'm going to trash my copy and remember the author's name."
2,Huge Book,This is very Huge book a lot of pounds but too little information. Did you ever read Oracle Documentation about Des 2K? Yes? You have already red this book. I recomend 2 new book within Oracle series (Des 2K Handbook and Des2k Generator) it is much better.
3,"wide coverage, but lacks depth","The examples in this book were poor. Several examples were incorrect, with steps missing and eronious references. This is a bread and butter book for the author as can be seen by the rapid publishing of other titles by the same writer."
1,Do not even think about buying this book!,"My instructor used this book to teach Oracle's CASE tool Designer 2000. If I or any of my classmates knew anything about this book before, we would have had our instructor fired for selecting such a TERRIBLE book. Why would anyone write a book on a Beta and the publisher publish the book? Just doesn't make sense! The first 3 chapters are the most important, and at the same time has the majority of the problems. My class (including the instructor (who is a DBA) individually tested the first three chapters four times and none of us got it to work more than twice. Many of of the instructions are obscure compared to actually using the released Designer 2000 product. And when you do follow the instructions accurately you do not always get the result needed. Overall this book deserves a negative 1 star. HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!"
2,"Good in parts, but those parts are hard to find","For such a large book the information content is not high. Some sections are quite good, but the style of the book is inconsistent and the index does not work very well. Still, this was the only des2k book I could find that claimed to cover version2 and the section on BPR was informative."
2,A brief coverage of the Designer Tool at best.,"I found this book to be superficial. I was hoping to find an in-depth coverage of obscure, important topics but was disappointed to find maybe about 80% of the required topics, and that only briefly covered. If the topics were covered properly then this book should have been at least 3x as thick if not three separate volumes (hmmm... there's idea!)"
1,You get nothing from this book,It's the worst book I have ever seen. Think about how you could get from the book and not about how many pages it have.
2,Doesn't smell like Spring Breeze,"I ordered the Secret ""Spring Breeze"" from Amazon as I couldn't find it in any store in my area for past 6 months. Use to be carried by several retail markets and drug stores, but seems to have disappeared. I was excited when my package of ""Spring Breeze"" arrived, but disappointed that it seems to smell like powdered scent rather than ""Spring Breeze"". I still can't come up with an explanation as to why it would smell so differently. There can't acually be a market for counterfeit ""Spring Breeze"" ... can there?! I called ""Secret"" product line toll free number to gain insight on the ""Spring Breeze"" and any changes in product or distribution. Reps were relatively rude and didn't provide any useful information.Would appreciate any insights that others can share.Thanx"
5,Wonderful,"I listen to a good deal of bluegrass, and believe this is one of the best albums I have ever listened to.This was my second copy since I lost the first one, and jonesed for it for years."
1,Worst litter I've used so far.,"Only buy this litter if you're interested in converting your cat urine into cement. It's not absorbent at all, if you don't scoop it the second the cat pees, it will turn into something you have to pry out with a metal tool. I'm not joking."
1,Warning!,"After reading the reviews of this game I could not wait to get it home and running. Alas, it was not to be. If you have a 16MB Voodoo3 3000D series AGP Graphics Card this game will probably not work on your system. My brand new Dell PC system had all of the proper specs and drivers and WW II Fighters still would not work on it. The game crashed back to the desktop no matter what I did. What a bummer!"
3,There's better stuff out there,"It's a good game, for 1997 standard. There are no training missions, and its way to easy. I dont know how to desribe the flight model, exept that its not so good.You never know where your wingmen are, and there are no wingman commands.Also, the ground objects look bland and boring.The guns look pretty unrealistic too (so why did I buy it? it was on sale for [X]).However, If you are an oassional user and dont are so much about realism, this is for you.If I were you, and wanted a good WWII sim, I would get IL-2 Sturmovik or MS Combat Flight Simulator 1&2."
5,THE BEST COMBAT GAME YET!,"It is the best combat game! You should fly the P-51. Theres 7 fighter-bombers the P-51,Spittfighter,P38,BF,FW,Me and P47."
1,Unable to get the program to print,"This program looked like just what I wanted to do Christmas cards this year. I am a Mac user and when the program arrived I loaded it and tried to do a sample card. After hours of trying I am still unable to get a card to print out. Searched the program online and was unable to find a ""help"" web site. I feel like I am throwing 30 plus dollars into the trash."
1,not worth it!!!!!!!!!,"Don't buy this game! Because first, you cant trade players or you cant sign free angets. 2nd the players look like they dont have helmets!!! 3rd there is no franchise and you cant make the gameplay hard. Every game you win by over 50 points. Your O-Line dosent block because when you wait in the pocket you will always get sacked! There is no person talking during the game! You dont here John Madden. Trust me during the season you will get very very bored! Listen to my advice and I hope this review helped you alot...."
3,not quite what i had hoped for,"well when i bought the game, i realized it was for the GB and that the graphics wouldn't be great. i accepted that fact before buying the game. my disapointment was in the game play. the first time i played i was blowing the other team out by the 2nd quarter. 90% of the passes are completions, so there is no challenge involved. also, i realized that there was no NFLPA lisence so the players would only be identifies by numbers, but they dont even keep players stats. i will say this, there is potential for a good game here, all it needs is players stats and difficulty settings, and if they do that i will buy it again next year."
2,this game ...!,"this is one of the worst games i have purchased. the players look like little dots. when playing the defense you cannot tackle very well if at all. there are almost no interceptions or fumbles. n offense almost every pass is a completion. you can pretty much run all over the computer and last but not least why even have a kicking game. to sum it up there has to be a better game with some kind of compettion, i mean i like an offensive game as much as the next person but this is rediciouls."
4,"Madden 2001, Great Game For GB",I think Madden 2001 is one of the greatest games ever for GB.The graphics are just ok but i believe you or your kids will like it.
4,It's a great game!,"I think it was a pretty good game. The graphics were great and the players were very realistic and they sometimes even talked! If you are into sports, this is the game for you!"
3,First Impressions,"This player is just slightly bigger and heavier than the Shuffle, and the battery life does seem to be as good, but overall is a very good MP3 Player for running.When I first got this player, it would only hold about 500 MB. I reformatted it by right clicking on the folder in Windows Explorer, and selecting Format... This solved the problem, so don't return it if you have the same problem."
4,Great for Exercise Music,"For what I need, this is great. It plays all my music, it charges quickly without needed any charger other than my computer, it's easy to use, and it's small. I looked at a lot of options and while this does not last as long as others, the price is right and it's perfect for going to the gym."
1,"Deceptive! Not item pictured, not accurate quantity. Buyer beware!","This is not what I received. I didn't get the yellow bottle, it's a white and green, and it's not what my mom uses. Horrible experience, buyer beware! They indicate that this is for more than one bottle, but that's a lie- they only sent one."
3,Good- but...,I was really happy to find a lanolin based lotion that would absorb nicely. My daughter has bad eczema and this has helped but the fragrance is TOO much. Most people who are looking for eczema help/relief are looking for all natural fragrance free products. This one just doesn't fit the bill.
5,Great kid's movie,"I love this movie! It is so cute and great for kids! The moral is that the meaning of Christmas is love and giving, not just getting presents. John Malkovich and Kelly McGillis do two of the voices."
2,Maybe it's me but I could not get it to fit my S&W 686P,"I purchased this item as I am very familiar with Pachmayr grips as I had one for my 357 Colt Python. Although the grip was good, and the feel is very comfortable, I could not get it to fit my 357 S&W 686p properly. The center screw that attaches the grip in place was hindered by the trigger spring that rest between the handle. Unless I bore a new hole in the grips there was no way it would fit properly. I had no choice but to return it and just had to contend with the original Hogue grips which was not bad but too small for me. Thank god for Amazon's fantastic return policy."
2,not up to par,The book is very badly written with lots of repetitions. The resumes presented are in the functional style that is normally used when you have something to hide. Not the favorites for executives or headhunters. The book is targeted for line managers or people with less than 10 years on the work force.
3,Don't be fooled...,"These are NOT Intermatic timers. They are Woods timers. The wires aren't quite as easy to use. We have found a slightly higher failure rate. They are generically equivalent, but should not be presented as Intermatic when they are not."
1,Completely absurd,"I've not read this Hardy story, but I understand from doing a web search that this presentation departs from the original story both in details and in plotline. The climax is simply crazy. My wife and I just shook our heads and said ""Give me a break."" Hardy must be rotating robustly in his grave.Look, we love period pieces, and have watched just about every one available on DVD or VHS. But sometimes, if they're badly done, they're just a waste of time. This movies ranks right up there with the most recent version of Mansfield Park as an adaptation crime. The story itself calls for remake."
1,IM PISSED,"Why was this Cd under Amy Lee from the band..... I baught if for my husband thinking it would be a great gift, but it wasnt..... Im really pissed I spent like 40 bucks for 2 CDS we will not listen to..."
1,WHAT A RIP OFF,"To anyone who thinks they are getting something new or unreleased by Amy Lee solo singer of Evanescence (like myself):DO NOT BUY THIS STUFF!! THIS IS NOT HER!!! IT IS SOME JAZZ SAX MUSIC, REALLY DOESN'T ROCK!!!!"
3,thank you Amy Lee fans!! Amazon needs to know!!,"Thank you, to all you fans for clearing up the fact the this isn't the Amy Lee from Ev!I was ready to buy it because I love her voice. However, someone needsexplain this to Amazon, too!! This cd keeps coming up in similar searches for Evanscence.It's sad that this Amy Lee has to hear so much about the other, but I wish her luck, too."
5,Delizioso - also yummy.,"Here in the heart of the midwest, Italian exotica like bottarga is hard to come by, even in local Italian markets. I fell in love with its salty, fishy, granular goodness in Italy a couple of years ago. It's wonderful on pasta, salads, omelets. It's not easy to find even shopping online. This dried tuna roe has been a wonderful treat, and an excellent value for the price.Dried Tuna Roe - Bottarga, Sicilia"
4,Excellent performance and value,"Full manual mode is great, plus RAW capability. Definitely a step up from point-and-shoots, but still simple enough for on-the-go snapshots. Beautiful LCD display."
5,Big Features but still very compact,"I love this camera. It has a myriad of features to control exposure and all aspects of lighting. It has a huge very clear display and the 10 mega pixels provide incredible detail allowing you to ""zoom in"" on your photos to an even greater degree. The battery lasts a very long time and with the 2 GB extreme card I bought you can create a video of up to about 20 minutes. You can also adjust ""speed"" to 100, 200, 400 or 800 as well as reduce the mega pixels. Making this ajustment increases or decreases th number of pictures that will fit on your card so it can be useful. Great camera, endless features and adjustments and still fully automatic if you prefer and it comes with a much larger lense than most ""pocket"" digital cameras. Enjoy."
3,pointless waste of 200 bucks,i have no problem with the actual camera --- only with the fact that the sister camera (panasonic lumix dmclx2) is LITERALLY exactly the same (except for the inclusion of photoshop 4 with the leica version) this camera is a panasonic with a leica lens no matter if you want to buy it for 400 from panasonic or 600 from leica...... i still own one and love the camera but cant understand why someone would be stupid enough to pay 200 more for the name (maybe 50 bucks for the leica name.... but 200????)
3,so so,"the camera is gorgeous. so is the leather case. but for a fancy camera with a lot of heritage, i found the dlux a bit of a let down. my canon ixus 5mp took even clearer photos."
3,un-chill,"Im so glad I payed [so little] for this. Its not that its so bad. This compilation just doesn't know if it wants to be new age or electronica. Best tracks are from The Orb, Moby, and Everything but the girl. But then a few tracks are just bad, and the rest is filler. If you want new age stuff, get ""Pure Moods"". If your more into electronica, go for the ""Urbal Beats"" volume one compilation. This just tries too hard to be both."
4,Chill All the Way Through,"Even though I agree that most of the songs on here are on other ambient compliations, I would have to say that this CD was well put together. I love the version of ""Moments In Love"" that was on here, as well as the Adagio song. There are dancey moments, but if you're looking for something to put on without having to flip through tracks, I would definitely recommend this release. It has the right combination of high and low tempo beats for those days when you just want to... chill, I guess."
2,Recycled and out-dated,"If you can't get the first song right on a compilation CD then what does that tell you about the rest of it. Usually, I am left disappointed when compilation CD's are promoting songs that are over a year old. THIS CD has songs that are ancient - and it's not like they are ""classics"" to begin with."
1,poor,"cardboard characters trudge through a predictable plot accompanied by leaden description and occasional paras seemingly lifted from old reuters reports, presented as unlikely dialogue. main achievement is making an interesting country seem dull. chiefly, i blame myself for turning each page until the end, stupidly expecting improvement."
2,This lady needs to choose songs with better melodies!,"Too often, Randy has chosen unspectacular materialto showcase her enormous gift. She is a greatinterpreter of any good lyrical idea but the musicsupporting it is usually unmemorable. If you wanta great Randy album, pick up ""RAW SILK"". She gaveher all vocally to that and the material was first-rate.The only song that was speaking to me on PERMANENTwas ""Tell It To Your Heart"". What a continual waste ofa career."
4,The Plot Thickens,"Closer to a true mosaic novel than the first book, Wild Cards II: Aces High brings new life to the comic book/science fiction trope of an alien invasion. I was hoping that the new ebook edition would have some new, expanded material in it like the first Wild Cards book did, but it's the same as it was in previous editions. The only reason I didn't give the book a full 5 stars is that it does feel like there are gaps in the story that would benefit from additional writing. Otherwise, an admirable tale."
4,Simply beautiful,"Considering the large amount of ground these DVDs have to cover, they do a great job. Every single national park is given time, with interesting facts and great scenery. I loved learning and especially *seeing* more of some of the obscure parks that you normally can't find much information about, such as Kobuk Valley. For National Park lovers, it's a great addition to your national park library."
3,It doesn't have good video quality,"I enjoyed watching the videos and discovering all the national parks. However, it has VCR video quality in digital format... no comments."
5,Bosch,Here's another product I have used many times. I put them in the 'ol Explorer and she came back to life. These are great plugs that make a nice difference in the vehicle.
1,"No tech support, Publisher is GONE!",The software wont work on any newer (win98+) systems. The book should be purchased seperatly for a couple of dollars. There is no technical support available for the product at all anymore.Almost looked good.
2,Pretty BAD,"Looks like an outdoor concert that could have been in your backyard with the amount of people there. Timothy Leary's comments make up most of the DVD and do not need to be included-he cuts into performances with his relentless rambling on about nothing--Canned Heat was good-Iron Butterfly was good-it had the original bass player (Lee Dorman) the guitarist Eric Braunn (who died a few years ago) was there but where was Ron Bushy(drummer) or Doug Engle (lead vocals)? The singer in this lineup was terrible -I saw this group a few yrs later when they had Bushy, Dorman, and Engle-lots better than this lineup--Electric Flag was good with Nick Granvities (only original member) on lead vocals-- I wish they had interviews with the musicians and named the current members instead of having to listen to the Leary Crap!!!! My advice is to stay away from this one--its no Woodstock material----"
1,As bad as it gets,"Absolute crap. You got Leary yammering on about whatever DURING many of the songs.You got ""It's a Beautiful Day"" listed as one of the performers but you just get to hear one of their songs while watching footage of an Apollo mission.You got some very old, very tired folks trying to play in front of a crowd of about four hundred people who just want to eat their sandwiches and leave.I wasn't aware that Grand Funk Railroad or B S & T or Iron Butterfly were at the original Woodstock, but then, there's a lot I don't know. Like what ever posessed me to buy this bus wreck in the first place.I thought it would be cool. It's not."
5,Christmas Gift,This purchase was a gift for Christmas for someone who is extremely hard to buy for. She Loveddddd it.
4,worth it,"this cd is really cool, nice buy for 6 bucks or whetever it costs. I really like the flow, the singer has funny rhymes."
1,"Dean Ween, you have so much to answer for","ANOTHER rock/funk band with a rapper with no flow. Gee, color me surprised. All the background says the band is fantastic live, and I hope that's the case because the energy on the disc seems forced and cliché. Sure, you can talk over a loud track, but that doesn't make you a rapper. You can throw swear words around, but that doesn't make you a rebel. You can talk about herding sheep, but that doesn't necessarily make you a shepherd. The music is all riffs you've heard before, which really surprises me. If Dean Ween is co-producing, he must have been asleep at the controls, because none of the sonic genius or creativity that marks their work is here. I hope Dean had a nice nap."
5,Works as advertised,It has a definate click when changing batteries. Best part was heavy terminals and switches batteries without loosing contact with power
4,Blue Sea 9001e Battery switch selector,"Quality product at a reasonable price! Easy install, clearly marked dial indicator with stout terminal connections. would recommend to friends!"
5,A must upgrade,"As for as simple economical handling upgrades this product when used on the inter rear sway bar mounts will make one of the best improvements in low speed maneuvering that one can do. It will eliminate any sense of under steering while making those many turns driving around in cities at city speeds. Thus, I have nearly eliminated most of that outer tire wear on the front tires, so much so I generally don’t have to rotate my tires but a few times during their life. The grease fitting is a good idea should one develop a squeak but I’ve yet to have that problem with the red type although I did grease it well at installation. Do note there are several grades of polyurethane so read up prior to ordering. Also, I’ve done this upgrade on nearly every vehicle that I owned in the past 20 years; from mini vans to sports sedans with the same results on each."
1,broke in first weeks,"i ignored the reviews that it would break, but i was wrong. it broke right away. DONT BUY!!!!!"
4,As Good As Plastic Gets,"This is a scale model M4A1 Assault Rifle made of plastic with full auto, double LED flashlight, fore grip, and a mock ACOG scope. The only flaw in design is the magazine does not hold the BBs. Instead, it holds the electric charge cable and loads from the top. The BBs are contained inside the ACOG scope sadly. Other than that, it is a great product."
1,Not good,I have owned this gun in the past. It works pretty well for the first week but then completely breaks down. Also the company is really stupid and you can tell they have no Idea what they have because if you look at the sample picture the fore-grip is put on backwards. Pathetic gun.
1,it sucks,this gun sucks for cqb and it has long barrel and the mag is the battery so dont buy extra mags
3,Fair,"It's fair. it looks good, and feels good. It has a low Velocity, (around 220 FPS) and it only goes about 60 feet before it curves toward the ground."
4,Retreat into nature to find a deeper connection to spirit.,Looking for a guide to make your own soul journey and retreat into nature. Emilie offers a guide to create your own spiritual journey facilitated by retreating from everyday life. Nature or the wilderness is the best place to find that connection to spirit that sometimes gets lost in the busy pace of life. Let this guide be your companion to create your retreat into the wilderness to experience the Divine.
4,"Fresh, clean vibe","I like the feel of this book - it seems to come from a world that is bright and clean and warm and tidy and quietly creative.I like the side-by-side comparisons of swatches in different weight yarns. And this is a good introduction to household items that are knittable - a different way of thinking for me.My favorite item so far though is the loofah mitt - knitted with sisal. That just wouldn't have occurred to me ever.This book isn't worth hundreds of dollars or anything, but I think it offers something fresh for those like me who are new to knitting."
2,"Two titles, two covers, one book.","I purchased this book after buying ""Simple Knits for Easy Living"" by the same author. To my surprise, they were the same book!! The only differences were the title and front cover. Needless to say I was upset.The book itself was okay. These are very simple knits for beginner knitters."
2,Disappointing,"Sadly, I have to say this book isn't worth buying.I LOVE Erika Knight's ""Simple Knits for Cherished Babies,"" and because I love it so much, I ignored the bad reviews for Ms. Knight's ""Comfort's of Home."" Then I got the book. Boy, what a disappointment.Not only is there nothing innovative here, but some of the stuff is, in my opinion, not very attractive. Knitters will be better off finding free patterns on the web for afghan's, washcloths, pillows, etc."
2,Pretty to look at but...,"It's a book to appeal to yuppies who want to learn to knit and no nothing about the craft. For those of us who already knit, it's nothing we haven't seen before. There's not enough technical info or tips to help a new knitter and the projects are pricey!! I found the photos to artsy, blurry to be of much use. I think a new knitter/learner will get real ticked off trying to use this book."
5,Top notch pop punk,"I'll admit to a bit of a bias, as I played bass on this record, but the songs are of the highest caliber and the production is excellent (Thanks, Mass!!). I may never see my 20% of the profits, but if you like good old fashioned poppy punk rock, this is the record for you. Dave Parasite resides comfortably among the pantheon of songwriters who deserve the highest honors within this genre. His work is catchy yet insightful, embodying all of the desires and unfulfilled wishes of the lovelorn. He can make you laugh and cry without forcing you to spend months in a van with him. Please purchase this record before you wind up in the band and incapable of objective criticism. SC"
3,LAME CHRISTMAS CONCERT WITH LA ROSS REPLACING BIG P!,"The entire Christmas in Vienna series produced by CBS/Sony in the 90s (with Placido Domingo and a couple of guest stars - in this case Luciano's place being taken by Miss Ross) was a rather tepid series of concerts. It consists of soupy musical arrangements, the singers propped up in front of mics, music stands, a big symphony orchestra and chorus ringing in the Holidays to a bored-looking formal European audience. Placi and Jose are definitely phoning it in. It's Miss Ross who is trying to pump some life into the dreary proceedings.This is a good one to have on the big screen TV if you're recovering from a big Christmas dinner and need a nap. And if you put on Kiri Te Kanawa's Christmas Concert after this one, you'll be in a complete holiday coma!"
3,disappointing,"There have been a number of Christmas In Vienna concerts with international star Plácido Domingo an changing international stars like Diana Ross, Dionne Warwick, José Carreras etc. In my opinion this concert from 1992 as the first one of this series featuring Diana Ross was one of the best. I was highly delighted at the release of this concert on DVD and I was deeply disappointed when I have received my order. When someone can trust in the indications in the credits the concert was taken in high definition. Therefore the DVD could have been produced in 16:9 at least.This issue could have got 5 stars easily. Since the DVD has been released in 4:3 letterbox and the videotransfer is not from the best possible quality I can give 3 stars only."
4,Just what my wife wanted!,She's been wanting this for years but until now couldn't find on DVD. Too bad it isn't available in HD.
3,working in 100 degree heat is bad for you. So are bullets.,"Poor casper. His character starts off as a part of a bank robbing team that goes horribly wrong. Next thing he knows, He's once again working as a guard in a bank with no air conditioning in the middle of Texas. A hot place? You bet. The only up-shot is the fact he's banging the bosses beautiful wife. Things go from bad to worse when he picks up a hitch-hiker with some very dangerous friends. Sounds like an ugly mess? It is. When the bullets start flying, you can be sure someone is gonna go down for the count."
2,Pretty Bad...,"Casper Van Dien (of Starship Troopers) is an ex-bad cop who moves to a sleepy town to retire after his lover died in a foiled heist. But he soon gets drawn into a new heist with a bank owner's wife.Throw in a Baldwin brother and some other unknowns, and you've got the makings of a pretty bad B-movie. Full of cliches and marginal acting, On The Border was really just a bore. Casper Van Dien has really gone downhill since Starship Troopers, and although the performances were tolerable for the most part, the role of his ex-partner (played by Bentley Mitchum) was so bad it was painful to watch.It was so predictable and dull, I fast-forwarded through most of the last 1/3 of the movie & all of the gratuitous love scenes.Only two things kept this movie afloat: the good performance of one of the bad guys, played by Bryan Brown (FX, Cocktail), and the promise of an interesting twist at the end. Otherwise I would have shut it off after 30 minutes and given it a 1-star."
4,On The Border...On DVD,"I am a guy who bought this movie on VHS a few years ago, it later broke and I did not have it. A few months ago I replaced it with a DVD version while the picture quality is mediocre the cast shines. The two that caught my eye were CASPER VAN DIEN and CAMILLA OVERBYE ROOS. Casper is one of the hottest guys around, in some scenes you can see his a--. He has great abs, muscles, and his body is so hot, and look at his face too. He is the hottest guy ever. There are some very hot scenes in this movie and the story is good too. As for the acting, you can judge that for yourself."
3,"frogs, snakes, and lizards",excellant educational product for projects and for play. My daughter used them to make a desert shadowbox for a 3rd grade science project.
5,McQueen Fun,I got this for my son for Halloween and he was soooo excited. After Halloween he still wears it around the house.
5,Expanding our own souls,"Readers of this comprehensive collection of soul-comunication stories are encouraged to expand their own soul awareness not only by the intimately revealing experiences of the many contributors, but also by the exquisite poetry and profound insights of the author/editor herself. Elisabeth's writing suggests a life-long familiarity with the greater Reality that is being opened up to all of us -- it is another profoundly welcome contribution to the awakening of Consciousness in every area of human existence."
4,Cult is back !!!,"I couldn't believe what I heard when I was watching the movie..... that voice... that voice... isn't the Cult ? but I never heard this song.... Surprise !!!! New stuff !!!!The songs are great..... but better is that The Cult is back and making good music, like in the old times."
2,Only lasted one Christmas,I bought this last Christmas and it worked fine for my holiday lights. This year I used it for a week and suddenly it stopped working all together. I wish these things were sturdier so I wouldn't have to buy them once a year.
4,Intermatic HB61RC Digital Outdoor Timer Photo Control,"Works great. This is my second timer from Intermatic. The first one is the predecessor of this model, which has lasted through 7 years of winter use. I am using both timers to control 1/2hp to 1hp electric de-icer motors which keep my lagoon from freezing during the winter months. Both devices are exposed to winter eliminates from November through March."
5,this band ROCKS!,"I have loved this band for about two years. Once i had heard this album (in spain, where i am from but i live here in england)), i had to buy all the others. They are just simply amazing! i love the whole heavy feel they have but then Cristina's vocals make each song so powerful and epic. The heavy metal-like guitar riffs and then the grungey style really go well together. the best song is 'Better Day'. Actually they are all great. I think everyone should hear this band, and i cant wait until they play another gig here in london. I've tried to convert some of my friends into Dover fans but they just wont. Oh well, i still like to think there is hope in the world and that others will see how special this band really are. i think they should sing more in Spanish though because the song on their other album,'Sister', thats in spanish is really good. TRUST ME. BUY THIS ALBUM. DOVER COULD CHANGE YOUR LIFE."
3,Good Pen,This is a pretty good pen. It's enjoyable and writes well. Ink flow is good. Get this pen if you are looking for a well made cartridge pen.I know the clip is their trademark but it is rather cumbersome. It's like a giant paperclip.For a little more money I would step up to the TWSBI 540 EF nib. It has a reservoir thus holding more ink and writes just as well if not better. Otherwise this is a fine pen.
2,Kind of Scratcy,"I really wanted to like this pen. After reading all the rave review, how could I go wrong especially for the price. I received it in the mail and it looked great. However, after filling the pen with Noodler Bulletproof Black, I started writing with it and notice it was scratch, a significant amount of pressure needed to be applied which made my hand sore and the ink flow was unsatisfactory. Maybe it's the fine nib, and to be honest, I have not tried the medium nib which may indeed make a difference. In contrast I also have a fine nib TWSBI demonstrator which writes much more smoothly than the Lamy. In my opinion, spend the extra $30 and buy the TWSBI. You won't regret it."
4,Lifeless Sound,Yes after waiting years for this treasure it finally arrived everything was great but what happened to the sound..Flate muddy DEAD I'm sure the CD was better but that was produced by SONY? I hope they can remarster this superb production
1,Don't buy it,"Ugly animation, annoying voices. I wouldn't buy it again and I don't show it to my daughter."
4,"Hayden Wedge Thong, Brown",I really like this sandal. The fit is good and it is very comfortable. It is very true to size.
1,Broken drawer slides- safety issue,"The plastic ring broke off of the drawer slide, so now the drawer does not track properly, and is a safety concern if my 2-year old decides to open the drawer. Nowhere can you find replacement parts or contact information on the Simplicity company since their matching crib was recalled. I couldn't return mine for the recall- I had to return it to another store that luckily took it back! Simplicity takes these safety issues so lightly."
1,"Shoddy product, frustrating as heck! Never buy this!","This piece took forever to assemble, arriving in no fewer than 30 pieces. The directions are vague... everything in the diagrams is a rectangle! But the actual parts aren't labeled, so you never know which of the 7 types of rectangular parts they mean. When finished, all of the front slats between the drawers fell out anytime we moved it... they have no bolts to hold them in, the just sit in shallow slots. The drawers are shaky and the whole unit is unstable. Also, as many of the holes are not lined up, so I couldn't even put in some of the bolts."
2,Boring,"Weak plot and cinematography. Could not watch it all. It may of improved, but I don't like waiting for a movie to ""capture"" me."
4,A Great TV Show. Cancelled Like So Many Others. Oh Well.,"I'm not sure where this show would have gone had it not been cancelled, it rather played itself out by the time it came to an end, but on DVDs or streaming, without the commercials, it makes for a nice long movie.This version of ""Robinson Crusoe"" plays like a bit of ""Swiss Family Robinson"" and ""Gilligans Island"" as he's not just marooned, he's inventively so. He doesn't just errect a shelter but a tree-top aerie of several wings, an architectural wonder in bamboo and driftwood, and parts of ships. Pirates show up; cannibals, everyone chased away.And for the gayboys and ladies, there's lots of beautiful chest shots of the two main actors.This is very entertaining, good for the entire family (provided they can sit still) and beautifully filmed. If only there was more TV like it. But, you can buy or rent the show and that's better than nothing."
3,Still unsure...,"I loved the idea behind the series, but I am not sure it is holding my attention. I am hoping the series picks up as I watch more episodes and I get more attached to the characters."
4,A Great Into into Slope Stability,"This book is great for engineers trying to learn Slope Stability Analysis on their own, or for instruction in the classroom. The book talks about field invesigation techniques, anylitical analysis, and new computer methods including X-Stable. This book is a must for any Geotechnical Engineer."
1,never received,"This item was never received. I placed an order for 2 items, including this product, but received only one item I had ordered, and one item I did not order. When I called customer service to get assistance with getting the order corrected, I was told that I would receive the Almond Mint Texture Balm, and a return order for the product I had not received. That was more than 2 weeks ago, and I have not received anything. I am in the process of returning the entire shipment. A customer should not have to do follow-up for an incorrect order."
5,Cannot live without it!!!,Most of the time I am not motivated to review any product ..it has to be exceptionally good for me to take the time however there are a few products that will make me want to tell the world :) This is one of them. I have slightly curly hair but when it becomes longer the curl tends to fall out toward the bottom. I am sure due to the heaviness of the hair. This product when used to scrunch your hair tends to defines the curl and lift up the ends.It takes very little rubbed into the palm of your hand. I can never be without it!!!!! NEVER!!
1,worthless,"This didn't do a thing for me. It was a bit sticky, but didn't add definition or separate curls or any of that nonsense. I have generally healthy, medium length, fine hair (and a lot of it). I use the cleansing conditioner and stick with my Matrix gel and mousse for styling."
1,okay...,"If your hair is thick, product helps with volume, but if you have fine hair, then it ends up flat and greasy. buyer beware. know your hair type."
5,texture balm,I absolutely love this product!!! When I ran out of the small texture balm WEN sent me in my collection I tried to find something that would work as well as this product...needless to say I spent a lot of money and went through a lot of different products only to be very disappointed! This texture balm makes my hair look shiny and healthy. I get a lot of compliments on my hair these days and I swear it's because of this product!---Thanks Amazon for carrying this line!
4,revised treatment,I tried the wen products I been hooked ever since. This product revises your treatment until your ready to wash your hair agian.
1,Should be titled Programming Windows(tm) Services in C++,"This book should have been titled ""Programming Windows(tm) Services: Implementing Application Servers IN C++"" I am a Delphi programmer and was misled into thinking that this book would help me in Delphi. I was disappointed to find one and a half snippets of Delphi code with little to no explanation."
5,This book is fascinating,This book gives extraordinary insight into one of the most undocument programming subjects.
3,Great title on a relatively less documented subject.,Writing windows services has always been tricky. The book: Right subject at the right time!
4,Programming Windows(tm) Services,I reviewed this book before it came out. It has some good technical material and advice to those that want to write Services in Windows. The Author tries to cover everything that a developer would need to write industrial strength window Service Servers.However just keep in mind that the author is biased in favour of Microsoft and most Microsoft technologies.Duc
5,A young guy who rocks,"I first bought the CD because I am a big fan of singer/songwriters Lowen & Navarro and I knew that they were part of the writing team for this new artist. The songs are great (as all Lowen & Navarro songs are) but what really surpised me was Young's talent. It is refreshing to hear a young singer actually sing. He reminded me of John Mellancamp--very rocky with just a touch of folk. If you like Mellancamp, you'll like him; and if you like them, check out Lowen & Navarro."
5,A Wonderful Surprise,"I am a General Hospital fan, which is what prompted me to buy this CD, but I honestly was not sure what to expect. Let me say, this CD is a must have!! This is not a pop album, the strong guitar and Jacob's raspy vocals are pure rock! There is an amazing amount of talent displayed here, especially for a debut album. Jacob Young is definitely an artist to watch, as I predict he will explode if any of the songs from this CD are picked up by radio. Whatever you do, don't presume anything about this young man just because he is a young, handsome actor. There are even times on this album where his voice is remniscent of Kurt Cobain. I just cannot say enough good things about this CD, so please, do not miss out on this one!!"
2,"Umm, trite",The plot-lines contrivedThe lyrics are triteHis voice isToo lowAnd consciously breathyBut he's YoungHere's hopingHe'll grow.
5,Review By a Philippine Nena Fan Who Understands German,This has the same tracklisting as the Nena cd album ?( FRAGEZEICHEN ). Please check that entry for my review.
5,A Warm Neighborly Feeling,"I found this book to be a pleasant surprise. In the wake of Sept. 11th, many of us have changed our perspectives on the world and what truly matters. Todd and Susan Montgomery have taken a very thoughtful and heartfelt look at what really matters most, our friends and family. I personally celebrated the pictures used in this book. Some made me laugh, some made me cry, but above all they made me think. The Montgomery's have contributed to our national perspective and truly aided in the post-911 healing process. Todd and Susan - thank you!! I'm sure you are both wonderful people, and I'd welcome the chance to say so in person."
5,A wonderful reminder of good in the world,"We all need reminders of why we're here and what's good in the world. You never know from where those reminders will come, but for me, it came from this beautiful book. Thanks to Susan and Todd Montgomery for sharing and providing a window to the world in which we live, but don't always see and appreciate."
5,Little book holds simple and profound message for all,"This little book, with its beautifully-crafted descriptives for each treasure of a picture, will be a constant reminder to me of what life is all about - the value of each human life, the incredible beauty of nature, and gratitude to God for giving us precious gifts every single day."
3,Biased,"After studying the piano market for the past six years, I have found it continuosly changing and evolving. I have seen major manufacturers go bancrupt, while nominal brands explode onto the market. It is very disturbing when freinds are mislead by outdated information. This is not the fault of Mr. Fine, but the piano market changes very rapidly and no one would be able to give a definative reveiw of currently produced pianos. This book is an excellent text on how pianos work and what to look for when buying a piano, new or used. Mr. Fines rating is not a fair assessment of some of the brands that are on the market today. So read that part of the book with an open mind."
5,Everything you need to know about a piano except how to play,"I'm purchasing a piano for my child, and know nothing about the instrument. This book dealt with every aspect of it in thoughtful detail without getting tedious. It covers everything from the instrument itself (function and appearance), to how to assess it as an amatuer, to when to bring in a professional. It lists manufacturers, production trends over time, and other such useful information. I would recommend this book for anyone who owns or is thinking about owning a piano."
1,This book is completely inaccurate,"I was recently privileged to have a tour in Europe, and to play on some of the world's exceptional pianos - Bechstein, Bosie, Hamberg SS, and Grotrian. And I am well familiar with NYSS and MasonHamlin because we have these in the halls, both antique and new.If I put my honest (still an opinion) ratings on how they respond, sound,and built, it'll not look like Mr Fine's list at all. And I'm not fan of Mason Hamlins (I'm SteinwayD person) but why is it down in tier-2? That is strange to me because, personally, the new Hamlins seem to sound much better than most on tier-1 list. and better built. I think Mr. Fine ""calculates"" the quality of piano and largely ignores the ""experience"" factor, which I think is important in choosing one. My opinion: don't pick a brand. Pick a piano!"
3,Very good except for ratings which are useless,"This is a very good book for people with little knowledge of pianos. The sections on construction, things to look out for, sales gimmicks and techniques etc. It is a very good source for most things related to pianos purchasing except his ratings. The historical information about the companies is interesting if not particularly helpful but the ratings which are based on biased opinions are essentially useless. It has created a tier system which basically just feeds people egos. the pricing secions are a little more helpful but not greatly.I recommend using the informations sections and ignoring the rating sections."
5,The Piano Book - Buy and Owning a New or Used Piano,Excellent book that saved me much time and possible grief if I had bought the wrong piano
4,Buyer beware!,"Buyer beware! This item is not the updated 4th edition of Larry Fine's essential book. It is instead the 1994 third edition. The 2008 fourth edition is far superior in format, coverage, and information. Unfortunately, the Amazon online identification blurb does not make clear the distinction between the two editions. Moreover, Fine's annual update volumes now contain virtually all the information important to any prospective piano purchaser. KNO"
5,highly informative,"When beginning to look for a piano, we read Larry Fine's The Piano Book at the recommendation of our local piano technician. It is superbly written and highly informative. It covers everything from the mechanics of pianos in general to the relative features and qualities of various makes of pianos. In the end, it was well worth the effort and helped us make a well informed decision on the type and make of piano we purchased."
1,Not what I was hoping for...,"This title is a bit misleading, I think. I was looking for a book on Internet advertising strategies -- how to decide where to advertise, develop effective ads, calculate the success of campaigns, etc. Instead, this book is an introductory primer to the Internet itself with definitions of email and surfing and very basic information on creating a site. If you've never been online, this book may help you but if you're looking for some meaty information about the techniques and strategies behind advertising on the Web, this is not the book for you."
1,Perhaps the worst SF novel ever published.,"I will admit to not having read this book in over 30 years, yet it still maintains a special place in my heart as the worst book I ever read. It may well be the worst science fiction novel ever published.I have actually stopped reading bad books, but somehow it this one was so bad it was impossible to put it down. Reading this book can best be likened to watching a train wreck in slow motion: you know things are bad and going to get worse, but you just cannot tear your eyes away.Spoiler alert: every plot complication is solved by an Ornio-""something""."
4,The right tool for the job.,This Makita reciprocating saw works well for cutting pipes in the wall next to a stud. The sawzalls sometimes just can not get it done in close quarters. I highly recommend it for light duty cutting in close quarters.
3,has old style battery,"Was dissapointed that saw had old style battery.Don't know why,but date of manufacture should tell something.Four years old ,but new !!!!On the plus side-easy to change battery- have bad hands. The 18 volt battery case takes 2 of us to change. Have 2 drills ,flashlite and now replacement saw.[...]"
5,Made a big impression on me as a kid,"This book made a big impression on me as a 7th grader. The girls in the book have to memorize Tennyson's ""The Lady of Shallot"" for their summertime homework. I went ahead and memorized it with them.The story isn't terribly creepy but must've had the right amount of mystery for me. The girls in the story are upper middle class and the vocabulary, behavior and atmosphere of the story is so vastly different from what modern schoolkids are accustomed to that I think this would be a very good learning experience for them. This book set me off with a lifelong love of all things British.Sit down with this book (and a dictionary for all of the obscure terms in Tennyson's poem) and I guarantee you'll have a good time. (You'll find out what 'brazen greaves' are!)On either side the river lieLong fields of barley and of rye...."
2,Some useful historical information..,"This book contains some useful historical information but if an in-depth study of the history of Colonial Algeria is required, one can find better works.Lorcin's simplistic thesis on the ""Kabyle Myth"" (Berber Good/Arab bad) really adds nothing to the reader's knowledge of the actual differences between the ethnic groups in Algeria. The fact that the European powers divided colonial societies along racial, ethic, and religious lines is widely understood.To gain a true understanding of the differences (something I sought but unfortunately did not find in this book) between the Berbers and Arabs in Algeria would require a study into the Algerian people and nation itself rather than just the colonial archives of French, British, and Belgium libraries."
3,OK,i really excited to get this rail an dit came in only 3 days but the connecting points arnt so good pretty sturdy though.really long :) was missing some parts though should of been 39.99
3,Lots a fun while its in one piece,A weld that allowed the use of the angled transition piece failed so now it is two short rails of different heights and doesn't get much use. The feet stick out to the side which hampers the approach to the bar especially when its short.
1,WARNING STAY AWAY,"This rail is Pure Trash it wobbles, moves all over the place when you try to jib it. I could never get it level and it had a nasty lip where the 3 rail pieces joined that you could feel every time you tried to slide or grind.. complete CRAP if you want to waste your money please just send to my pay pal account I Need it. STAY AWAY FROM THIS RAIL.. AGAIN STAY AWAY"
5,Very Good !!!!,"I only purchased track 7, 8, and 9 but I have listened to other tracks and they sound very good. Track 7, 8, and 9 stand out due to the amazing vocals of Elliott Yamin. You can purchase through Itunes for these tracks. I never get tired of hearing his voice and you won't either."
2,not the best example of Navajo culture,"let me just start by saying the author is mormon. you can make your own judgment. its not a terrible book at all, it gives a good example of an outsiders view of the culture and religious practices, and tells some traditional stories(a bit poorly), But, in no way should this book be used as a reference, or taken too seriously. there are much better books on this subject from writers who have studied the culture much more intensely or who have grown up surrounded by it."
4,the living dead,I was very pleased with how quickly I received this purchase. I would recommend this seller to others
3,Not for Pilates,"This mat is under five feet in length, which means (at 5'8"") I couldn't even lay flat and be entirely on the mat. In addition, it is less than two feet wide. This might be a great mat for aerobics where you are on your feet, but look elsewhere if you practice Pilates, yoga, or other exercise that involves laying down or sitting with your legs outstretched. (It did seem to be high quality and was very lightweight. If they had a larger size, I would consider buying it.)"
5,I GIVE THIS 10 STARS,"THIS BAD BOY CUTS FOR REAL, RIPS THROUGH 3/4 BIRCH PLY LIKE PAPER. BATTERY LAST A LONG TIME AND YOU CAN USE IT WITH ONE HAND, AND IT CAN CUT CURVES VERY WELL ALSO. I TREAT THIS THING LIKE ONE OF MY KIDS BUY THIS YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED"
2,Too slow!,I ordered this saw thinking it would be good for cutting Formica type laminates. It actually has too low a speed to cut without chipping the material.
4,Not Bad for the money!,"Yes, I read a lot of reviews on this saw and the cheaper one and glad I went with this one. Although not the high speed of larger ones, I have used mine on drywall, wood, molding and backer board and all with the stock blade so I can't complain. I really didn't think it would do that well because you know you can't afford to buy cheap tools and for $178 it was well worth it. Not many Mfg's make this size saw and it' s nice to have. Wish DeWalt would make one.."
2,disappointing performance,"I'm afraid that I can't agree with the 5 star ratings some of the other reviewers have given this tool. My intended use was to cut 3/4 inch birch plywood to rough size to make the parts easier to handle on the table saw. I usually cut 1 sheet of plywood in half. The saw is grossly underpowered and can barely make it through 2 passes. I never expected it to replace a corded circular saw, but this barely qualifies as a saw. The blade typically slows dramatically and frequently stops during the 2nd cut - and this is with a fully charged battery. My model is a 12V - maybe the 14V version will do a little better for you. This is not a rugged tool, and it simply doesn't have the power to produce anything but frustration - and it's way overpriced. It's OK for the occasional DIYer looking to cut nothing thicker than 3/4 material. If you're used to handling pro tools, skip this model. Makita got this one all wrong."
4,Great saw.,"As a owner of the 9.6 volt saw I am still getting used to this new 14.4 but so far I like it.TomMansfild, Ma"
1,"He's Dope, But the CD STANKS","Cannibus has 2 good songs on the whole CD. He looks so tight on the tv, but his cd is surprisingly bad. Yes, I bought it, but the only really good song is second round knock out."
1,This album stinks,"what a piece of garbage. His only good song lyrically is ""How We Roll"" even tho that was made about 1 1/2 years ago... 2nd rd ko was weak lyrically, just like he is physically.. to be honest, my 1 is a little bit to generous... to bad amazon.com doesn't allow .0000001 stars!"
1,can -i-bus,this album is wackk to the ninth degree simply because the lyrics are wackk each track is wackk from the first song patriots to the last song is a horrible experience canibus is one the worst rappers in rap history avoid all of canibus albums at any cost or if you have this album only listen to it if you are drunk!
1,This Is Really Disappointing.... Don't Waste Your Bucks!,"I am a lover of rap music. The beats and rapping in this album are lousy. I had to use the fast forward button many times when listening to this album. I spent 10 minutes listening to this junk and dumped it straight into my store room. I hope that I'll never find this album again, as it reminds me that I've wasted my precious money on this piece of junk.Don't buy this album, unless you're into weak rapping and beats. I'll recommend ""The Infamous"" by Mobb Deep if you can still find it. Compare ""The Infamous"" with this and you will know what I mean.In short, I'm angry that I am ripped off buying this piece of junk."
1,overhyped&rated,this disc is a waste of time&money.considering all the Hype this is a bad joke.Wycliff is a Hit&Miss Producer.when he is on it's on but when it clanks it rims off badly.and this is the case.Canibus lost the hype trying to rock the Mic againest LL.COOl J.he was embarassed then and never recovered.the Lyrics&music are pretty flat.
1,I'll put it in layman's terms for ya,"Nothing Canibus says makes sense. NONE OF IT. He uses big words that he doesn't even know the meaning of, such as ""serendipitous""...he compares battle rappers to serendipitous whores...now what the heck is that supposed to mean?Calling Canibus a lyrical genius is an insult to the 50 or so people in history who actually deserve the title...from Bob Dylan to Eminem. Canibus writes a bunch of nonsense. If you like a guy basically spitting about a bunch of nonsensical garbage and bragging about himself on the mic and using disgusting sexual innuendo 24/7, then fine, listen to him. But anyone with tatse will admit Canibus is, like most rappers, a waste of time, with absolutely nothing to say about anything."
3,Canibus is on of the rawest to hold a mic!,"My honest opinion of this album is that it is bangin! straight up and down. the lyrics? oh my god, they got me going coo-coo for co-co puffs! canibus is definitely one of if not the most gifted mc's i have ever heard. the production kind of slacks at times, but if you like lyrics like i do, you'll disregard the production and pay close attention to what canibus is trying to tell ya'll. the brother is ""deep like the mind of farakahn"" check out the track ""channel zero"" or even ""niggonometry"". he is dropping science for real! if ya'll don't cop this cd, ya'll ain't really hip hop fans. out."
4,not bad.....but not too hot,"yeah it was aight.....i liked some parts and like totally disliked others man.......see i'm trying to talk like all you mad G's out there....like ya'll peepz to my G canibus man, and like tight beats and that man.....yeah sick bros"
5,Lyrics Iz Tight,"I was anticipating Can-I-bus' album for a long time and he came strong. With tracks like Niggonometry, How We Roll, Patriots and espcially 2nd Round Knock it's impossible to disrespect this album. The beats may be short of what you expect but Can-I-Bus already said he ain't trying to make you dance. Beside Can-I-bus' lyrics will keep you captivated this whole album. Here is what rap really needs an artist who thinks and educates."
2,1998's Most Disappointing Album,"It was obvious from the start that Canibus' debut album would not live up to its Godzilla sized hype. There are a few nice cuts like 'Patriots', 'Whats Goin On', and 'Buckingham Palace', but most of the songs fail to impress. The most glaring problem with the album is the lack of big name productions. Wyclef and company's beats are way too mellow for Canibus' rough'ish voice. Also, many of the cuts have been heard elsewhere on mixtapes or on 'UNI-vs-All'.."
2,Wack lackluster production=a waste of a skilled lyricist.,"Before the release of his debut, canibus co-starred on common's and ll cool j album out shinining them both by far. Canibus became the new buzz of the underground with his unmatched battle style raps. I had alot of hopes for his album just before i copped it. I give canibus himself 5 stars, but wyclef's lack luster flavorless production killed the whole album. canibus's lyrical integrity couldn't even disguise the lack luster beats. With primo, rza and some underground producers on the beats the results on can-i-bus would been a ground breaking debut."
4,When people were listening,This is the Album by Canibus that had huge resalts but doomeda failure then he fell off the comercial map unto the underground map.Song by Song Review.2.Patriots-Back when he was a 100% Battle MC 10/103.Get Retarded-A country Beat with power rapping 7/104.Track 4-This is pretty good soft soozing Beat 9/105.Second Round K.O.-Great LL Diss top 40 10/106.Whats going on-Does not blend in 8/107.I Honor U-This is pretty good 9/108.Hype-nitis-does great Lyrically does not blend 10/109.How we roll-Again it does not fit him 9/1010.Channel 0-This one does fit good 10/1011.Lets Roll-Again the Lyrics are great 9/1012.Buckingham Palace-does not blend but nice 9/1013.Rip Rock-He does great Lyrically dumb beat 8/10Lyrics 10/10 Production 6/10 X Factor 7/10 Style 7/10 Voice 10Music 7/10 Innovative 7/10 Classic 6/10 Guest 5/10 Blends 3/10Overall 68 wich is about 3.5 Mics why not good producing to fit his awesome Lyrical Ability.
3,umm @ music fan toting Aesop Rock,"I doubt any artist on the Def Jux label could match the lyrical tenacity of songs like 'Buckingham Palace.'The only truely perfect song on the album is Buckingham Palace. Get Retarded, Niggonometry, and Patriots are all decent songs, Second Round KO is decent more or less because of it's beat, and hungry battle lyrics.What's Going On, and I Honor U are some of the more average songs on the album, and even though Hypenitis is pretty bad, How We Roll picks up with a bad chorus, but ill lyrics and a passable beat. Channel Zero, Let's Ride, Rip Rock, and Hypenitis take away from the album, to the point where the pros are equivalent to the cons. 2000BC is a better album, but this album has some worthy songs for any underground head.Pick up Rip the Jacker, Mic Club, 2000 BC, and Can-i-Bus for ill lyrics and production."
4,some real standout tracks,"all things said, cannibus is a monumental free-styler, unmatched. download some freestyles and you'll see. what he lacks is a monumental album. cann-i-bus isn't monumental, but there are some standouts. . .""Buckingham palace"" is one of my favorite rap songs. its one of the only songs that meats cannibus' superior lyrics and sharp delivery with a memorable beat- hypnotic, ambient, otherworldly. Next standout is ""I honor you"" which also has a great beat and solid female vocals, showing more depth than the average cannibus track. ""get retarded"" and ""nigganomentry"" are both good, but there's not enough strength here to make the album a blockbuster (obviously it never turned into one). I love cannibus, i recommend downloading said tracks. as for buying this cd, that's 50-50."
4,Hype lyrics!,"The man Canibus is hot. full stop. His lyrics are deeper than most wack freestylers out there. Buckingham palace, and hypnitis are my favorite cuts from the album. This man has proven that he can hang with veterans like ll cool j and others. did you here the cut from ll's phenominon? 4321? Canibus cut it up for real.hey get this album. Its critical to your health."
3,"Great Lyrics, No Beats!","Canibus is the best master of ceremony out right now. however, most people can't get into a rapper if he doesn't have good beats. the production team did a terrible job making beats that match canibis' rhyme style. you don't take a battle cat like canibus and give him slow, mellow beats. he shoulda got beats that enhanced his style. however, on the lyrical end,canibus held it down. a decent album over-all. better than most i have heard this year."
3,blah,"Unfortunately Wyclef did a *** job producing what could have been the greatest rap album ever. The beats were weak and didnt match the lyrics he was dropping. Fortunately, what ive heard of the newer cd C-quel coming out. Its much better. And atleast one track is featuring all of the Four Horsemen. When the Four Horsemen, Canibus, Ras Kass, Killah Priest, and Kurupt, release an album hip hop will be forever changed. With the 3 greatest lyricists of all time, No group, not even Wu Tang will be able to stand to them"
2,Can I Bus,"This CD has great lyrics, which Canibus has been come to be known for. The beats are extremel weak thouh. Canibus has appeared in many other great songs before this CD (Boys to Men, Beast from the East, Uni-4-form, making a Name For Ourselves, or any of his freestyles). Either get a hold of these tracks or wait till the second CD comes out, this one just ain't worth it"
2,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!,"I was anticipating this album for tha longest time, finally got it....and almost cried!!!! It sucks! There were a few good songs, ""I honor U"" and ""2nd Rnd KO""....I still say Canibus got tha illest lyrics of any MC out there...but his beats just st8 suck!!! He's gotta get his voice meshed with some phat beats and he'll blow up no doubt."
3,I tend to agree with what's stated above...,"Okay, being a hip-hop head myself who doesn't like R&B, I found it only making sense that I check this album out. I agree with what everyone else seems to say: good lyrics, good flow, BAD BEATS! Wyclef is NOT the right producer for Canibus. Can-I-Bus needs someone like Daz Dillinger(my favorite producer), Da Beatminerz(they would sound good with him), or maybe even DJ Quik. Just get someone who produces for people like Canibus, not Wyclef. Anyone, I mean ANYONE would be better than WYCLEF JEAN(well, okay maybe not Puff Daddy)! Their are some good tracks like ""2nd Round K.O."", the LL diss(I hate LL), ""I Honour U"", ""How We Roll"" and ""Let's Ride"", but the rest aren't quite as good, production wise. I suggest that Canibus get DJ Premier or another producer I stated above."
3,"Shows potential, but the beats wack","I can not complain about the lyrics,but the beats are weak. But I would probably still buy his next joint even if it had no beats. But I heard Premier was going to produce so I should not be blue."
3,CANIBUS,"I JUST WANT TO SAY THE 2ND ROUND KNOCK OUT SONG, I WOULD RATE OUT OF A 100 WOULD BE 110.ANYWAY AS I WAS SAYING HE'S A LEGEND JUST LIKE RAKIM. GOOD ON YA CANIBUS.KEEP IT REAL."
2,BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME!!!,"All real hip-hop headz know Canibus is one of raps best, he keeps it real and the man can hold is own. Canibus has been on various mix tapes ripping every mic he touched, his album was the most anticipated in 98 but weak production caused for the failure of this album. Canibus still gets props from me because I know what he can do so I'm not going to hold this WEAK album against him, please do not waste your money on this just wait until he drops his second album."
2,"Why'd you do it to 'em, 'Clef?","Wyclef took a skilled lyricist' album and covered it up with the worst beats he could've thought up. Buckingham Place and Scond Round KO are tight. The other wack beat kill my patience, and everyone will miss many of his sharp, thoughful metaphors because of it. He needs to hook up with someone that knows how to link a hard beat with razor-sharp lyrics. His words are on point, but it's hard to sift through those garbage beats on this LP."
3,Almost there,"Everybody anticipated Canibus' album, and i think most of us were let down. It wasn't on account of a lyical lacking. The lack came in the production of the songs. He didn't have any ill beats to spit over. Letting Wyclef have control of production was a mistake. There are some songs on the album that will spark interest such as: ""Patriots"" ""Get Retarded"" ""2nd Round KO"" ""I honor U"" and the lovely joint ""Buckingham Palace"". Is it worth buying? Ehh. You might want to see if you can dub it from somebody who already bought it before you spend any money."
3,Great lyrics...wack production,"Wyclef produced this and that ruined it theres like laid back type beats with murderin' hard lyrics from Bis yeah there is some dope tarcks but not many ""Secound Round KO is dope with Canibus rippin up LL if you want to here better Bis buy his other CD's"
5,art personafied,"this is/was, by far, Canibus' best album. the storytelling skills as shown on tracks such as ""I Honor U"" and ""Channel Zero"" are astounding. he has such a raw and lyrically gifted presence on the mic. i have yet to see him duplicate the talents he displayed on this album. tracks like ""Get Retarded"", ""Let's Ride"", ""Buckingham Palace"", and the smooth ""Hype-nitis"" have been gettin steady airplay in my deck since this LP's '98 release. oh and i cant end this review with failure to mention the notorious LL diss track ""Second Round KO"" or the mesh of rock and rap on ""Rip Rock"", which brings this album to a very nice close. then you hit repeat, and hear it all over again. all day, every day. if you haven't already, i highly suggest you pick this album up. its definitely in my top 5 all time favorites. i give it 5 stars!"
4,Under-rated/Under-appreciated,"Many reviews have been dogging the beats on this album. They are different and at first listen might sound goofy, but they grow on you. I also want to remind everyone that the great hip-hop albums aren't about beats but about the rhymes. Canibus doesn't let us down in this department delivering solid flows thru-out the album. This battle-hungry MC isn't going away, and with a tighter production next time he'll have himself a classic. The hype has died down and the pressure is off his shoulders. He's just waiting to blow us away again."
3,Canibus was a bust,"Canibus is my fav. emcee i was dissapointed by the production of his cd. he should have stayed wit The Lost Boyz (RIP Freaky TAH). I bumped Canibus back before he even made the cd, when he was on the underground tip. Beats was thight, just, flow dog, dont get all hypothetical, and ***, do more freestyles, i love that. peace"
4,Good stuff...,"While Scorn (Mick Harris) can get excruciatingly monotonous and Dead Voices on Air (Mark Spybey) is just simply hard to like due to lack of structure, this release brings out the best of both artists. Wicked drum patterns (ala Scorn) topped with a lot of interesting distorted effects and horns (is that what they are?). Something you can definitely groove to.It's generally good, and definitely my favorite out of the Threesome series."
5,An absoute must for the experimter,"This is an absolute classic. Used as a college text, it is still very relevant to the backyard scientist."
2,Not great for certain devices...,"Be warned that for certain devices, the renewal batteries don't last too long. For my visor, it lasted about a day, and for the Intel mp3 player, it lasted about 5 minutes. I belive that this is a because renewal batteries are alkaline and rechargable alkaline batteries are not designed for high-drain devices.So maybe, for electronic toys this might not be a problem but avoid this charger if you intend to use this recharger for high drain devices."
2,"Good, if you like Britten.","This is a nice recording and a pretty opera. Don't buy it if you're looking for Einstein on the Beach or Wozzeck; the music comes from Britten's lineage (with Corigliano's special effects). However, I'm guessing that this opera would be best heard live, otherwise it sounds too busy and attached to the stage action -- almost a bit cartoony. To this listener's senses, the whole opera is a bit old-fashioned but certainly enjoyable."
4,how Vexations can vex u!,"There are few recordings on the market of this exceptional piano piece by Erik Satie. This version by Alan Marks does almost 70 minutes of Satie's Vexations, and is currently probably the only version on the market. Vexations is a piano piece which ought to be repeated 840 times. The piece itselfs takes about 90 to 210 seconds. The fact that it should be repeated 840 times is vexing. Play this recording repetitively and you're getting close to what Satie wanted.Alan Marks's rendition is clear, the recording is flawless. This is one of the best recordings I know, fluent, laid-back and that is the way I appreciate it. Compare this with Aldo Cicciolini's recording (too fast) and Reinbert de Leeuw's recording (slow and concise, probably one of the best).Alan Marks's is today the best recording that money can buy."
1,This album is unutterably dire.,"No, really really awful. Listen to some of the 30-second chunks they give you - that's all I heard, or needed to hear. I gave it one star because amazon don't give you the option of awarding none. Undoubtedly the worst music I have ever heard anyone attempt to sell."
2,Not Very Realistic Puzzling,I finally forced myself to finsh reading this book and it was really weird It was confusing and not realistic And wats with the aliens that screwed the whole book up Cant flame and the boy have normal adventures I wish i hadnt bought this book i could have really saved the money but i did enjoy the parts about the boys friendship with flame
1,WORST OF THE SERIES,"I am a HUGE black stallion fan, but this was a shame to the series and the author. aliens? come on, get real. And a little far fetched with the crazy man coming after them. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. You will be wasting your money."
4,Walter Farley With a Twist,"I truly enjoy all of The original Black Stallion books that I read as a child. The Island Stallion Races is however one of my favorites. Many people might automatically discount a book that includes unexplained phenomenon. Even though this book includes two extra-terrestrials in the character list, the story is captivating. Many of the reviews that I have read comment on how they don't like the predictable plane crashes and shipwrecks that are in many of Farley's books, however, when he gives them something new and exciting to read about, they complain about that too. I for one thought that this book was outstanding and definitely worth the money, expecially if you want something just a little bit different."
5,captivating and imaginative,"I read this book not too long ago. I had not heard about the book before hand and did not read the summary of it on the back cover, so I had no idea what to expect from it. What I got was something completely unexpected. I thought I was going to hear about Steve Duncan taking Flame from the island to race but in a similar format as in the first novel, The Black Stallion. When the extra-terrestrials showed up I was happily surprised. This is the only novel in which Farley ventures into the world of science fiction. I think he did a marvelous job with it although I do agree with the other reviewer that it is somewhat difficult to understand and may not be and easy read for younger children like many of the other books in the series have turned out to be."
1,I read this 30+ years ago and still remember it.,"Maybe the fact that it is so memorable should make me rate it higher, but I was an avid Farley fan and had read all his books that I could get my hands on, in both the Black Stallion and Island Stallion series. But this one above all others stands out in my mind because it was the only one (that I recall anyway) that involved aliens. I can still taste the disappointment that I experienced as a child when aliens got introduced into an otherwise reasonably realistic though somewhat implausible series.Now that my daughters will be reading over the coming years, I hope they read the entire series, but I hope they don't experience the disappointment I did over this book."
1,A big disappointment,"I had read a good review and the Lehar and Kalman songs sounded interesting. Her pronunciation of various languages is good and that's about all that I can say that is good. Thin little voice with no expression, no verve. We listened once and never will again."
2,Orff - Carmina Burana,I bought the CD of Carmina Burana to replace the tape I had of the same performance. The major draw back of the CD is that the sound / volume is inconsistent. This reduces my enjoyment of the CD and I have considered buying another version of Carmina Burana which will hopefully have better sound quality.
5,Exceptional Media on Indian Contributions,"It is rare to find such a truthful, unvarnished presentation of the influences and contributions of American Indians that is intertaining and suitable for both adults and children (a little long for very young children.) Narrated by N. Scott Momaday, it covers advances by Indian people in the western hemisphere and the impact those influences and contributions had on the cultures of Europe and the whole Eastern hemisphere after contact, from food, language, maps, guided explorations, survival skills, sports, medicine and many, many other things. Well photographed, written and scripted. Highly recommended for schools, but every Indian family should have this video."
4,A very solid knife.,"I found this knife to be a very solid platform. I appreciate the heavy weight of this knife and the larger frame. The pinned frame of the knife is the way to go. Recently I have had a few of the knives with a screwed frame, and they hold up to just about nothing. The larger knife is more comfortable in a larger hand. The ""Made In America"" stamp is more appreciated these days... not just for a pride factor, but getting replacement parts if needed, I can access them much easier.Pros: Large frame, solid construction.Cons: Thicker blade thends to keep a larger edge, making razor sharpness not an option, but it does hold a nice edge."
5,Pure Awesomeness,"I used to collect these with my dad when I was younger. I had the collection, but they were stolen. I had not been able to hunt them down until now. Came in perfect condition just like in the picture. Seller sent fast and got here in a very timely manner. So cool that I can buy these again. I purchased 2 and am purchasing another as I type this"
5,Soldiers' Heart,"The horror of war, the memories of lost friends and lost innocence, have haunted the survivor of violence since the days of Homer's Iliad. The experience of the twentieth century has been preserved by poet-soldiers such as Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon, who revealed the horrors of World War I, and others as far afield as Wolfgang Borchert describing the terrors of the World War II German soldier. Now in the same vein comes Charles Patterson, whose collection of poems ""The Petrified Heart"" reveals again in all its horror, anxiety, exhilaration the nature of combat in Vietnam. Read these poems and you'll understand how - why - those who experience war can never forget - the friends they lost - the horrors they saw - the lives they took. Read and try to understand."
4,Released,"I met Chuck Patterson, the lawyer, while researching a story about a death row inmate that he agreed to represent pro bono, because the man had been a fellow Marine at Khe Sanh.I met Chuck Patterson, the poet, when he slipped me a poem he had written on a battlefield after the death of a friend. I've read a few of Chuck's poems since, but I did not realize how good they are until I read them in the context of this collection. I loaned this chap book to a couple of colleagues who are Vietnam veterans; neither man could read it in the office, choosing instead to take it home where they could read alone.These poems have the feel of something alive, something sired by the poet but entities independent of him. It's as if they lived in a cage in Chuck's chest then broke out; the result is poetry on the prowl, poems that are sleek, dangerous, and beautiful. It is an important work, done well."
5,A drop of the Dharma,"This unpretentious little book, printed in its paperback edition on slightly rough, newspapery paper, is humble about itself, but it is so full of warmth, love and heart that I can't see how anyone could *NOT* fall in love with it. The author injects her personal quest for a teacher, for answers, and for a good relationship with her mother into a series of interviews with Tibetans. I found the down-to-earthness absolutely refreshing. Her encounter with the Dalai Lama reinforces my extremely high opinion of him (he jumped down one step and told Sandy ""Now I'm on the same level as you!"") But all sorts of little vignettes shine forth... This book also has some really practical advice strung throughout, told by Tibetans themselves, instructions on how to meditate, how to honor a guru, how to live with a loving heart. I will definitely read this book again someday soon!"
1,Words fail me.......,Rare footage? No..... Elvis music? No.... Laughably bad pseudo-Elvis impressionist screeching along with a plethora of factual and historical inaccuracies?? YESSSSSS!!!!! The Ole Colonel himself seldom managed to foist an equally schlocky compilation of dung upon an unsuspecting public. Stay Away Joe!!!
5,This book has brought meaning to my life!,"Better than Money Can Buy: The New Volunteers is a wonderful moment by moment look into the beautiful world of selfless service. Not only does it discuss what selfless service really is, but it offers practical tools that the reader can put to use in daily life. These tools can help the reader become of service wherever he or she might go - whether it be in the workplace or in the family or wherever one might volunteer.This book offers the inspiration to know that there are people out there doing things to change the world for the better and they are doing so joyfully, energetically and purposefully. Thank You Dr. Danziger and Mr. Kilpatrick for assuring us that we work not alone!"
5,A fast paced interesting story,"The 'Warrior Brothers"", a two thumbs up sci FI tale of time and space,that embodies all the elements of future space travel,and still reflects all of mans present day interpersonal conflicts and dreams. It is a fast paced interesting story that takes the reader to the end with no dull moments.I highly recommend this book to all!!!"
1,poor quality; works intermittently - NOT HEAVY DUTY,"The only ""heavy"" thing about these timers is the weight -- not the performance. One of the two timers works with relative regularity (interesting that regularity is relative for a clock of sorts). The other quickly gets off time and does not turn on/off as a function of the little pins it is constructed to respond to. I would STRONGLY recommend buying a different product."
3,Product is nice but not the price,"Works fine, but you can get it at half the price in a big box home improvement store. Also, it does not work with three-pronged plugs."
4,Good low price timer,"I have these timers and I just want to point out that the receiver on these timers if made for a 2 prong. I went out and got a grounded 3 prong converter at walmart for 3 for under $2 and it works fine now.The only thing is that whenever I go near the timers, to plug something else in or whatever I always bump the time of day dial and have to reset it.... so if you have the money it might be nicer to go with a digital. But for the price of these timers... it works just fine."
1,bad product description,"This clams to be the heavy duty timer, this is just the normal two prong unit I thought that I was ordering the unit that includes the grounding prong. To send this back I would have to pay the shipping which would be almost as much as the cost of the timers to begin with. Be sure you read the description on what you are ordering, not just what you think you are ordering."
5,Great for Culinary Arts students,"The book is broken down into regions of the world. Within each region, the foods and beverages are discussed. Each region also has a wonderful map with native foods printed onto the map. In addition to the regional cuisine information, there are also recipes for each region. The second part of the book contains information on major classifications of a food item. (mustards, herbs, coffee) A must have for any culinary arts student."
2,Concise but Euro-centric,"I gave two stars to this book because it puts more emphasis on European food than non-European food. For example, its France section has pages after pages of recipes while the Japan section, has only a few with simple dishes, which to me, does not seem to introduce the multi-dimentional aspects of Japanese cuisine. Thailand is not even included, which is another example of the Euro-centric nature of this book. When the book's title bares a word, world, I expect equal representations of all of the countries.Although it is helpful to read brief summaries of each country's cuisine in this book, before recipes, due to the skewed representation of countries in the world, I started to wonder whether the summaries are even true.I find maps with regional cooking ingredients helpful."
4,It's a good thing,"As for reviewer Sluitjer's pan of this performance, just how many available recordings are there to validate a judgement of ""worst possible""? To cross-compare versions of Harris symphonism practically requires sticking entirely to the over-programmed #3. I will agree that this is really Ormandy music. But I love this piece enough that I wish it would get more trials like this. I think I will keep this Keenan NZSO version along with the classic one from the 1950s. It is less emotional, but the sauce isn't quite so gooey."
1,The worst possible Harris!,"This is absolutely the worst possible performance of Roy Harris' Symphony #7. It doesn't even sound like Harris! If they only would have listened to Eugene Ormandy's recording of this work with the Philadelphia Orchestra (Albany TROY 256), they would have known how this symphony is supposed to be performed. That 1955 mono recording may be a little shrill, but nevertheless so much preferable to this dreadful first stereo recording of this neglected symphony."
5,The best of the bunch,"I have purchased 11 books to plan my trip to Montana. I do not wish to write reviews on all of them, but felt compelled to comment on this one. It is far and away the best book I have found for planning a driving trip through the state. It listed 3-4 times as many motels (apparantly all of them)as any other book. The same is true for places to eat. It listed every gas stop. None of the other books listed any. Its maps are much more thorough, and they have maps of small towns as well as the big ones. The quick reference charts are priceless, and it is the only book to offer discounts from the states merchants. A truly priceless book, and I highly recommend it to anyone even thinking of going to Montana."
1,disappointed,"I was extremely disappointed at the low quality of this product, which I can only contribute to poor writing by the co-author Magoteaux."
5,Final Touchs for Winning,I have been Barrel Racing for 2 yrs with good success . After reading this book cover to cover I was able to shave 1 full second off our time in the same arena . I hope to put all the information to good use and keep shaving off thoses seconds . May be the NFR Next Year ?
1,Another Dell Dud,"Unfortunately, like other Dell Dimension models, this one is a dud. We purchased a 4600 and within 15 months, the power supply had died--just three months after the warranty ran out. Dell's customer service on this model was just as bad as on its others. We'll never buy another product from Dell, that's for sure."
5,Met Needs,Good purchase. Gave me the bases to build a better computer. With a couple of update it's work just fine.
1,don't buy dell,"I bought it directly from Dell.Now, I am having problem with activation problem.Factory installed software supposed not asked product key when you reinstall OS.However, this one did and I put number it came with the computer.Guess what? It took it and the installation completed.Problem not ended here. Computer asked me to do activation.I put COA and got the message ""invalid""It took COA when I installed and not taking for the activation?I called MS and they said OEM is manufacturer's responsibility.I called Dell and got the answer that Dell is not responsible because that is not hardware problem. If you want software support then pay for the service.Is it making sense to anybody?If you don't believe my word go Dell forum then you will find someone have same problem.If you are unlucky, you will be stuck with that matter too."
2,Dell 4600 another power supply,"I am really glad I read reviews before we put out a lot of money to have our computer fixed! One month out of warranty, our computer wouldn't turn on. Customer service in India was difficult, we ordered a new power supply and bingo! The customer service is why we would not buy a Dell again. Too bad."
2,Motherboard vs Power Supply,"I run a small computer company out of my home, and had a client bring me her Dell 4600. It was about a month out of warranty, and would not power on. Dell Tech support (after 4 hours on the phone) told her it was a bad motherboard. After reading some of the reviews posted here which indicated a bad power supply, I pulled a generic power supply off the shelf and installed it, and that solved the problem.Why does Dell keep telling people this problem is the motherboard?? Obviously there are times that it COULD be a motherboard, but it's remarkable to see the number of people who have posted in the last two weeks with identical problems, and identical solutions."
1,why do I have to pay tax on out of state order,"I just don't understand why I have to pay California tax on a online purchase outside of the state. First, let me say I have purchased 3 computers from Dell before. I have NOT pay any tax on those computers and that's the thing I like about it. $2000 to $3000 computer save me a lot on the tax. If I have to pay tax, I am going to buy it from a local store. In a case where there is a problem, I can just bring it back to the store."
2,My First Dell...I should have stuck with Compaq,"When it works, this is a great PC. Unfortunately, every since I purchased it, there have been frequent hardware and software conflicts that will give me the Blue Screen of Death on a regular basis.During the first year, I was a frequent caller to Dell support, and always got the same answer...reinstall the operating system. You can only do this so many times before it gets really old. I have since decided to live with the flaws and try to squeeze as much out of this system as I can.My normal cycle is to give my old system to my kids when I upgrade every 2 years. This time around, I'll just have to buy them a new one as well, because I can't pass this headache on to anybody.If you don't count the frequent hard crashes, this PC is very fast and will do a lot of great things for you."
1,4600 Dimension,"I have one and the power went out and now I am also being told that the motherboard has to be replaced. I can't understand how this company has stayed in business. I thought that this company had better customer service, but everytime I call I get someone who can't speak English and had a hard time trying to understand what they are saying. I would NEVER BUY ANOTHER COMPUTER FROM DELL, AND IF I CAN FIND A WAY I WILL SUE THEM SINCE I CAN'T GET A REPLACEMENT FOR PRODUCT THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN PUT ON THE MARKET TO START OFF WITH.The funny part is that they are still selling this but with another name put on it."
2,Power Supply Failed,"I bought my dimension desktop in Nov 2003, and the power supply failed in Feb 2005, 3 months out of warranty. I never even bothered to call Dell tech support given the horror stories. I just went to CompUSA, bought another one for 24.95, and it seems to work again."
1,Faulty Power Supply,It has been 4 months since my 1-year warranty expired the system would not power up since yesterday. I could not find any useful posting on DELL's website but thanks to google saw these postings. when I got my computer originally the microphone would not work. DELL troubleshot it as a motherboard problem when in reality it was a problem with the sound card driver which I found out myself. I realized how pathetic DELL's support is then. So I am not going to waste time by calling them now. I am off to Fry's to get a power supply. Any recommendation on what brand/type I should look for?
2,Power Supply Boogaloo,"Wow, apparently the same problem as all the rest with this pig! One month out of warranty and the machine is deader than a post. The Dell folks say ""sorry, Charlie, not our fault we use inferior components"" and leave you to wash with the tide.I will try replacing the power supply. My next computer? I'll build the darned thing myself!"
2,Beware! Defective power supply in this model.,"I bought one of these in October 2003 from Dell. In December of 2004 (1 month out of warranty) it would not turn on. Dell tech support insisted it was a bad motherboard and wanted over $264. to install a new one. After searching Dell's Forums I found out that many, many customers had the same problem. Dell refuses to recognize that the power supplies on the 4600 are defective. I bought a new power supply at Circuit City and it solved my problem. I shouldn't have had to spend $50. on a defective part that Dell has been made aware by many customers. One thing strange about the problem is that the power supply doesn't fail until right after the 1 year warranty is up. It's sad to see how the quality of Dell computers has declined."
1,Avoid Dell at any cost,"My computer is ridicolously slow and there is clearly a problem with it. After spending countless hours with service representatives running diagnostics they decided to change the hard drive which caused nothing but having to backup all my data. The computer performance still is terrible, so is dell's service"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS IT WILL DIE ON YOU DELL S*CKS!!!,Only had this for two years...bought it brand new...lights and fan start flicking on and off on front of tower and on keyboard...then powered it up..worked fine..turned it off..lights and fan started running again...finally IT JUST DIED...Dell has the ABSOLUTE WORSE customer service around (from india)..they don't know s*it..I know more then them morons..they will not admit that this model (and who knows what any other model is going wrong with only time will tell)..they tried to sell me a whole new front assembly cover said it was the switch going bad..had a tech look at it and he doesn't even know what's wrong with it..don't know if it's the power supply or the front switch...what a big WASTE OF MONEY this pc was..WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER DELL and beware people when looking for a new PC stay AWAY FROM DELL FROM HELL!!
2,yet another 4600 Power Supply Issue!,"I googled ""power supply for dell Dimension 4600"" and found this page. I'll chime in that mine just died...1 month out of warranty! dell's support really does suck now, i'm not sure how they continue to get high ratings. I have an HP laptop as well and their support is excellent. i may be done with dell...."
2,Yet another power supply issue,"I spent almost 2 hours with tech support trying to diagnose something that they already know... the power supplies have a problem. My warranty expired 5 WEEKS AGO!! so I am ordering a new power supply. Hopefully this will fix it. If not, this PC will become target practice and I will not buy another Dell."
1,Another Faulty Power Supply,"Purchased on October 03, power supply failed in March 04. Check out the forums on the Dell website for hundreds of other posts on this issue. Dell is ignoring this issue so you should ignore Dell."
3,power supply issue here too,"I purchased mine in October 2003. Power supply failed two days ago, so I managed to go about 8 months after warranty expiration. Will replace it on my own. (based on everyone's issues, I am going to assume no motherboard problem)Other than that... computer seems okay. I did have the floppy drive jam while it was still in warranty. It was a pain in the butt to use their phone service because we had communication issues, (I couldn't understand him, and vice versa) finally he gave up and placed an order to have someone come fix it in person."
1,Unbelievable,"Wish I had seen these reviews prior to buying my Dells! My 4600 won't power on now, and I have had the motherboard replaced in my Dell laptop, too! Needless to say, I feel like a chump for buying 2 Dells. NEVER again!!"
2,"bad computer, bad service.","Same as the others. My guarrantee expired on january 12, after 1 year of purchasing, and bingo... by february 8 I kept on having blue screens and constant shut downs. They told me it was a motherboard problem, and That I needed to buy a new one. No way I am spending that money and giving it to them again. I rather get a new pc from another company. Tech support was pretty attentive I'd say, but half the time they knew what they were talking about. I am bringing my complaint, together with this webpage, as a proof, to the BBB."
2,Power Supply IS DEFECTIVE,"Four months out of warranty, my power supply died. And yes, Dell tried to tell me it was tech support. Stay away from this model, at least. I'll post an update if Dell decides to help me out."
3,4600 Power Supply Issue,"I just read somebody's else review on this, and I wanted to add my own 2 cents. I just had the same issue last night (computer would not start, and I called tech support). I am Computer person by trade, so I was just trying to get the parts sent to me. I knew the problem had to be the power supply, but even I have to go through all of the mundane and ridiculous steps that everyone else does. After getting through the language barrier (she wouldn't listen to what I was saying), she diagnosed the problem as a bad mboard, which I disagreed with.I then remembered that my wife's cousin (who had been living with us) had the same computer. It was in our basement not being used. I decided to try and switch power supplies, and boom! It worked. All I need to do is buy a new power supply. Dell's support has become terrible IMO."
2,Dell Dimension 4600 Pentium 4 P4 Motherboard,"I also thought Dell was a great computer because my company only buys Dell computers and I use 3 on the job and never had any problems. So bought a Dell Dimension 4600 Pentium 4 in September 2003 and it just died completely; A friend from my company verified it was was the mother board and said there has been alot of problems with the 4600's from the end of the year of 2003.Dell knows about it but won't publicly admit it or rectify the existing problem with customers; So I say to Dell you can ""Kiss my hard drive"". I'll try to repair mine but I won't buy another Dell nor do I recommend them. Ask yourself do you want to buy something from a company that's only concern is how big of a bonus can their exec's. get at the end of the year by selling junk and not standing behind their product"
1,Guess what failed?,"Am preparing to replace the power supply to a 4600 built 09/29/2003. Went online looking for a guide at Dell and lo-and-behold found that this is a systemic problem to 4600's built in last quarter of 2003.What chaps me is that Dell happily SOLD me a new power supply for a known issue with a specific computer built at a certain time. This is outrageous given the size of Dell. They have a problem and they should just send out power supplies at no charge to 4600 series purchasers from that time frame when this problem occurs.Something should be done, need to find some consumer advocate with influence."
3,Bad Power Supply,"I have had the same problem reported by others. Two months out of warranty (purchased 11/2003), I could not power up the Dell. The tech support folks pointed me to the motherboard as well. Since a test kit showed the power supply was actually OK, I almost believed I needed a new board. But after reading comments here and elsewhere, I swapped out the power supply and the Dell fired up instantly. Obviously, Dell has at least one bad batch of power supplies in the 4600 series. I hope they are able to recognize and compensate those who have had to supplement the hardware at their own expense, just outside the warranty period."
2,Dimension 4600 Power Supply,"Three months out of warranty and power supply failed. I see no reason to bother with their customer ""support"" given its notoriously poor quality.As for Dell in general, I decided never to purchase from them again when they failed to supply replacement packing slip to allow (...) my purchase of the 4600. Long story made short -- Dell has no integrity."
3,Inspiration with Ego,"All in all, ""Thinking for a Living"" was an inspirational and motivational read. Mr. Reiman sights some excellent examples of Big Thinkers throughout the ages. It's a little heavy on ego, as Joey pats himself on the back many times... but overall it's an interesting book"
2,Disappointed,"My impression is that this book is more about the author bragging about all that he has accomplished and thought about, than anything else. There isn't any really practical or specific advise on how to actually make a living by thinking, only very general tips and anecdotes."
1,BRILLIANT!?,"The only thing Brilliant or revolutionary about this book is ""How does someone turn PURE DRIVEL into a top selling book?"" This is a self congratulating gush from the world of 1998 about the ideas that the author IS GONING TO implement soon. There is no real value in terms of real world applications or guidance as to HOW. Worked for him. DRIVEL!!!"
4,Excellent Resource for Free Thinkers,"A look at ""out of the box thinking"" from one of the most dynamic, super-charged entreprenuer/free thinkers of our lifetimes.Explains how the principles of this century's greatest business and spiritual leaders can empower our own lives.Only complaint: Too short. Didn't want it to end."
1,worthless,"This book has nothing to offer ,don,t waste your time reading it.you could give it away to your local church or someone you ...p.s if you take a look at the reviewers,s user id,s ( mostly by a customer)and some other cue,s you could easily find out why this ridiculous book got high ratings."
1,not helped,I ordered this clips to hold the curl. it doesn't work with me although that my hair is too thin.it doesn't hold the section very will. i wasted my money !
4,"One the few I deeply connected with, beautiful symboligy","Of all the decks that I have looked through, this is the one that I most identify with. I find it easy to work with and the art work is beautiful. The text is very descriptive and helpfull."
3,Mixed review,"Like many of the reviewers here: Love the style, hate the battery. It would start losing its charge after 1 call and if left off the base would die within a few hours. Customer service at FunPhones (the seller) was horrendous, both in responding to shipping issues and returns issues. But, then I called the manufacturer and they were fast, friendly and professional. They sent me another phone right away that I got in a couple days and it works well. The phone is great looking and functional. If you don't care about how your phone looks, I would recommend getting another one that is more reliable. But, I think that since phones are present in your living space all the time they should look good, so this one is worth the extra hassle."
2,Batteries won't charge or hold a charge,"I returned first set and tried again. Same problem. Charged first time for 24 hours, after that batteries still would not either old a charge or take a charge. Still unsure of the real problem. Took second set back and bought Uniden. I would not recommend this product until they fix the proble."
1,Poor Excuse for a cordless phone,This is the worst cordless phone when it comes to battery life. I can't even leave it out of the charger overnight. My older Panasonic phones would be uncharged for the better part of a week and I could just pick it up and talk. This won't last overnight or 1 long conversation. That makes it a bad choice. I don't want to have to run to the charger during the day or be offline all day if I forget it at night.Good lucks but little value.
1,Worst phone ever,"Bought this phone exactly a year back at Radio Shack. The phone does not hold charge, and looks really cheap. The voice quality is alright which is not the only thing you'll look at when you buy a phone. There are other phones that'll offer you the same voice quality. In summary, don't buy this phone. You'll regret it."
1,Does not hold a charge,I purchased this phone mainly because I needed a phone for my Vonage service right away. I didn't do any research on it which resulted in me eating the cost of the phone because I couldn't find the receipt. I bought the single handset system. The worst thing about the phone is that it will not hold a charge. My computer is set up upstairs which is where the phone needs to be in order to charge. I would have the phone off the charger for not more than 3 hours and the low battery tone would beep. I went to sleep with the phone a few times next to me and woke up to a dead battery. Do not buy this phone. It sucks! Instead look into the Vonage multi-handset phone. I bought it for about $80.00 and it comes with 3 handsets! It is great!
3,Different than I expected,"I'm a huge Billy Sheehan fan - from the days with Talas through DLR and Mr.Big. So I was really excited to get this. Billy's playing is, as usual, amazing, playing almost all of the instruments and singing himself. At times I have to rewind just to really hear what was just played. My problem with this album is that it is so busy it's hard to hear much of a melody. The bass is jamming, the drums (sequenced) are extremely complicated and the guitar is all over the place. I was hoping for the melodic fluidity of the Sheenhan written Mr. Big tunes and they just aren't there on this album. Don't get me wrong, the musical ability on this album is awesome. Just don't expect the ""songs"" from his previous efforts."
1,I wouldn't pay to see Eddie Van Halen tap dance....,"Compression isn't a bad album, just not what I was expecting. I knew Billy would be singing this time around, but I expected at least some musical interludes (Joe Satriani - Flying In A Blue Dream perhaps). Billy does have an incredible voice, but he's one of the undisputed bass heavyweights. I wouldn't pay to see Eddie Van Halen tap dance and now I wish I wouldn't have paid to hear Billy sing."
5,Power Metal Rules,Pantera's album Power Metal was awsome and Phil's first album with Pantera. Power Metal is the album made before Cowboy's From Hell. Get this album if you don't have it. I really recomend this cd.
2,Not good,"I read in some other review that this album's music style was a mix of early Metallica and Judas Priest. Well, there may be some truth in that, but the quality of the riffs and melodies has a much lower standard than with the 2 abovementioned bands. I find little of interest here. 3 of the songs are almost good, the rest is below average heavy/thrash metal. A disappointing album."
5,AMAZING ALBUM!!,"Contrary to what some people say this is by no means a glam rock/metal album. It is a full force thrash metal peice of artwork. I wasn't really sure what to expect when i got it but was very pleasantly surprised. I am 32 years old and have been a huge fan of oldschool bay area type thrash since i was 16. of course at that time it wasn't old school yet. The guitarwork of Dimebag is amazing on this one and it just really goes to show what a huge talent he was. Phil's vocals are very different than on any of their later releases but is definitely a huge improvement over their previous singer. Power and intensity wise this one comes pretty close to matching cowboys from hell, but not quite."
4,And it all started HERE!,"After three RATT soundalike LPs (Metal Magic, Projects In the Jungle and I Am the Night) Pantera got Phil on vocals and gave us Power Metal. This sounds more like the band we all knew n loved in the 90s than their other 80s efforts but this 88 album still hardly predicts their 90s sound- although at times it does sound like a rough ROUGH blueprint for Cowboys From Hell. Worth buying for hardcore Dimebag fans."
5,1ST CD with New Singer Phil A.,"This is where the band changed and went really heavy. Power Metal is an excellent classic and the best new line up the band could have ever made. Shipping was fast, seller was on top of it packaged very well. Always a pleasure shopping on Amazon"
1,Poor Quality...don't bother!,"Looked good in the picture but when it came time for assembly I knew there was problem. The ropes are nylon, and are looped through a little pocket to hold the end of the cross bars an then threaded back into the nylon rope itself by scrunching the nylon rope to make the weave open and then shoving the end up in there. It holds only when pulled down on. If you move around in your chair or take a bit of time squirming to get comfortable you can easily find yourself on the ground. It didn't happen right away, only after repeated use...I think I sat in my chair for a couple of hours for perhaps a total of 10 days before I found myself on the ground this afternoon when it fell apart. I am returning it. I think I will try an ENO."
2,poor directions and confusing setup,"I cannot believe how difficult this thing is for me to put together. The directions are poorly written and not intuitive at all. looks like it'd be nice if I could assemble it properly, but it has ended up being a waste of money and royal pain in the rear end to try to put together. I want my money back."
2,poor,I own two similar chairs but this is not the same product and is of a lower quality overall. This product came with no packaging but shipped in the product's battered box. The box says that it includes an inflatable pillow but there was no such thing in the box. The cup holder was moldy. There is not enough rope to hang this and it does not come with the required hardware. Disappointed.
2,Cradle Chair,"This chair took forever to arrive. I ordered two. Arrived with no instructions and we found it very difficulty to figure out. After the company that makes the chair emailed us the instructions we attempted again to set it up. Before we could sit in it the string holidng it at the top BROKE! The cording is nylon and was ""melted"" together. One of these areas is where it broke. Sent them back!!"
1,Poor Quality,"This chair was poor quality. The wood was soft wood and was not well finished. I bought a more expensive one, a brand which I have used for years and it is much better quality."
5,Buy this product,We love this chair. It is hot as heck here and it still held up through the summer.
4,They have gone crazy alright...,This is alot of very sexy girls getting very crazy. You get what you pay for here. Not as good as Girls Gone Wild but it's pretty good.
4,Great HD Picture,"HD is the way to go low cost and free HD dvd`s on this purchase.Why pay 400.00 for Blueray ? Not everyone wants a game console.Sharp picture with HD DVD and Regular DVD .A little slow loading first DVD on start up , second DVD OKOnly had for 1 mth hope it lasts many years.Easy hookup to HD TV HDMI ."
4,"For the price, this is an obvious buy!","This is one of the cheaper HD DVD players out there, mainly because it is 1080i and not the greatest 1080P set out there. Here is a news flash: if you have a 720P set, it doesn't even matter! A vast majority of the TVs out there are 720P, and with one of those, you won't even notice an increase to 1080P, but your wallet will. This DVD player is a great buy, and the HD movies I watch on mine are simply stunning. The remote has many buttons, and I think, a little too many. That along is a dumb reason to write this off. however, another minor thing that could get a little annoying is it's long start up time. It takes probably 30-40 seconds for the unit to come on and eject the bay to load a disc. Once you place the disk in there, the load time is very fast. About 10 seconds until the disc begins to play. That's not too big of a deal. Right?A really good player! use HDMI if you can!"
4,Good player for first generation,The quality is great. The movies are crystal clear. Very easy to use.One drawback is the amount of time it takes to load a disc. The player will take several seconds until it recognizes the disc and starts to play it
5,Great buy,"This player is an excellent value for those early adopters who only need 1080i output for their display. I received this player, hooked it up via hdmi, updated the firmware to preempt any glitches (simple if you have an ethernet cable), and tossed in Batman Begins (load time did not seem a big deal). Incredible color and level of detail. Also The upconverting chip set in this player is tough to beat so regular dvds look exceptional as they are converted to 1080i. Overall a great buy!"
5,Glad I bought it!,"I have had this player now for about 3 weeks. Love it. No issues with HDMI connection. I use an HDMI switcher and it has worked without problems. I was going to wait until they worked out this format war, but when I saw the price so low I thought ""why not"". Glad I did. Our set is over 50 inches and I try to only watch HD content, if I can help it. If the Blue-ray players come down to the 2-3 hundred dollar range I'll probably get one of those too. They are cheaper than my first VCRs back in the early days."
1,Using HDMI? Buyer Beware!!,"Con:Player only works if I run HDMI directly from player to TV, will not work if I run HDMI to receiver. Called toshiba, had to upgrade the firmware to 1.6 over the internet, and still did not work. Called Toshiba customer service twice, were very helpful, informed and friendly, but said there are some issues handing off the signal via HDMI, and it just might not work with this receiver. Have to return player.Con:Takes forever to boot up."
5,One of the best products money can buy,"I just love this machine since the very first moment. ""Casablanca"", being an old movie, looks incredible, all the aditional detail that went in the HD edition gives it a feel of profundity totally new. And the efect in more recent movies like ""King Kong"" results even stronger and amazing, almost 3D. With this new technology the difference between seeing a movie in a theater and seing it in your living room is no longer of quality, but of size, an advantage less important than many people tend to believe.The other feature of this player I'm most happy with is the upscaling capabilities. I own a copy of the international version of ""Kagemusha"", and while it looks undeniable crappy in my samsung upscaler, the Toshiba makes it look sharper and the colors more saturated and vivid. I have lots of DVDs, and I'm now happily rediscovering many of them.I cannot recomend this product enough. For the quality and the price you can't go wrong."
4,Toshiba HD-A2 HD DVD Player,"The original unit sent to me did not work from day 1. Was very, very unhappy with it. However, because Amazon was so understanding and without hesitation sent me a new unit which works just fine, I rated the unit a 4. The HD-DVD player was very easy to set up and after seeing approx. 5 movies, it has been working with no problems."
4,Seems pretty darn good.,"Well I just got my HD-A2 and I had it out of the box, up and running in a matter of minutes. Watching the HD DVD of King Kong is pretty awesome and I have to say the upconversion is pretty excellent on most of the SD DVDs that I tried. My assumption with upconverting is that the newer the DVD is the more noticeable the difference. My only question is whether I should have went with a 1080p model since I have a 1080p television but I am guessing the difference is probably fairly small. Besides I would rather wait to see the outcome of the ""format war"" before shelling out any more cash on this small hobby of mine."
5,this could help win the format war!!,"If you can't wait for the war to end, go this route. This player is great for the money you can't go wrong."
5,works GREAT !!,"Just a quick note to say that it works perfect out of box. no issues at all. Great , stunning picture. 5 free dvd offer came without a hitch. I would recommend it to anyone on a lower budget for hd player. Just gotta hope I did not pick the ""beta"" hd version this time..update : 2-21-08 I did get a beta...rats!wait to buy blue ray as ver 2.0 is due soon. 1.x is not upgradeable ...beware!"
5,Toshiba HD -A2 player is awesome!!!!,"I purchased the Toshiba HD-DVD HD-A2 player in January 2007 and it is awesome. The picture and sound as viewed on my Hitachi 42HDX62 Plasma TV and Sony 5.1 receiver is fantastic. I strongly recommend this player! There are slight delays in startup before loading a HD-DVD but otherwise works like a champ. From what I hear about Blu-Ray performance (on line reviews) and cost, for the money, the Toshiba is far superior. On my Hitachi TV I compared the standard King Kong DVD in a standard DVD player, to the same DVD that was upconverted through the HD-A2 player, to a HD-DVD version of King Kong and the difference was astonishing. The upconversion version was excellent (far better than standard DVD) but the HD-DVD version (displayed in 1080i) was 3-D quality! The 5.1 sound is super! For my viewing pleasure this player meets my needs (until something better comes along)."
4,"Excellent picture, a little slow.",I am really happy with our new HD DVD player and am glad we bought it. The graphics are amazing. The only thing is that it seems to take a little while to start up and delays just a little bit when you try and skip chapters or something. But besides that we haven't had any problems with it. I would say it's worth it to get one.
5,Toshiba,Great DVD player Great price. I waited but I do not think there is going to be a clear winner between BlueRay and HD. The price was too good to wait any longer.
4,Very nice!!,"This thing is really cool! Yes, it does take about a minute for it to ""turn on"" and be ready, but that's only a minor inconvenience. The main thing is that when you're watching an HDDVD movie, the picture and sound are awesome! Of course, some disks look better than others, but that has nothing to do with the player. It is does an excellent job of upscaling regular DVD titles (again, depending on the disk). The one thing that could be better, I guess, is what happens when you stop and ""rewind"" (like when you missed something that someone said, and you want to just back up). It isn't very smooth when doing this. You get about 1 frame per second when scanning backward (and probably forward as well, although I can't remember for sure). I guess it is just a lot of data and probably just the nature of HD-DVD technology in general. That's the only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars. But I have to say that overall, I am not disappointed in this purchase!"
2,"Great image, BUT...","With HD DVD The picture is stunning. Period. But you have to be lucky if you don't have technical problems. You are enjoying a lot with the incredible picture, and suddenly the image freezing...Then you press stop and think ""I'll fix in a minute"". Don't. Then you try to turn off the player, but you can't!!!! The freezing continues on the screen. Then you have to unplugged from the AC connection!!!! Other problem: sometimes the image skip, like when you press fast forward.OTHER QUESTION: PEOPLE OF TOSHIBA, WHERE ARE MY HD DVD's from the Rebate? It's time to know something about it. My father and me send all the facts required almost one month ago."
1,"BLUE RAY WON , DONT BUY HD DVD !!!!!","IF YOU NEED MORE INFORMATION GO TO GOOGLE AND TYPE BLUE RAY WON, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS HD DVD, TOSHIBA ANNOUNCE RETIRE ALL THEIR PRODUCTION!!!!!!!"
1,Very disappointed while watching SD DVD,"There are a lot of good reviews on this product, but my experience is not that good. I have a Panasonic TH-50PX75U 50"" 720p Plasma HDTV. I connect the HD DVD player and the TV by a HDMI cable. When I setup the TV shape to 16:9, it gives me a 4:3 picture (no widescreen). When I set the TV shape to 4:3, it gives me a 16:9 picture. The picture quality is very bad while playing SD DVD. I see no difference between it and my old standard DVD player. It looks to that the upconversion doesn't work. I did upgrade the firmware, but there is still no improvement. The picture quality is good while playing HD DVD, but I really want one that can upconvert SD DVD to HD DVD quality. I am going to return it anyway."
3,went to best buy and...was confused!,"First let me start off by saying I really want this because i have hd cable at home and everything looks absolutely awesome. so i went to best buy saw there display and was like... this promo looks no where near as awesome as my hd cable at home. i stood there and watched the whole promo disc over and over again and i walked away thinking huh, this makes no sense why would i upgrade to this when my panasonic up scaled dvd player looks exactly the same, also why would i upgrade when i am still going to see the black bars. and lastly why would i upgrade when my cable hd looks a lot better! i don't know you tell me. just so you know the 3 stars are from seeing it at best buy so i don't actually own one. i really wanted to get one but i really can't see the difference in my dvd player now. and oh yes i totaly see the difference in my dvd and cable hd cable hd is amazzzzing! reply please."
3,I must dissent from the majority opinion.,"There is more involved in the upgrading of dvd to hd dvd(or blue-ray) than is being discussed. Just as when dvd came in, I believe its manufacturers have failed to prove it or themselves worthy of replacing vhs. We watchers currently receive many millions of dvds loose in their cases, scarred and inoperable. Or, perhaps, in an organic case that wasn't designed to protect it since it's not stainless steel. Dvd players seem to have a very limited life also, primarily I beieve because of the clouding of the laser? lens. Somehow, vhs, when it came out, was expected to last for many years, like ms-dos or early windows versions or phones that weren't ""done-for"" when their special battery went low. Personally, I've been through 2 players in the last three years. It is tedious, I'll admit, to watch things quit working here as well as abroad. I watch, less than ever, I think because there has been less to tell."
3,Nice Player but by with caution!,"I purchased this player about a year ago. I have enjoyed it and have had no problems. It provides a great picture on Hd Dvds and serves as a nice upconverter for regular dvds. However, HD-DVD is losing the format war with Blu Ray. In the upcoming year you may find fewer new HD-DVD titles available. I would wait and see you how the format war plays out. Sadly, I dont believe Hd-DVD is going to have much support from the movie studios which means the end is near for this format."
5,YES IT'S SLOW TO LOAD UP BUT WORTH THE WAIT,I've had my player for about a month now and am very pleased thus far. I've watched about 10 movies in HD and they all looked great. Even older ones like Goodfellas & Purple Rain looked better than the standard versions. If you watch a more recent title like Blood Diamond or Hot Fuzz you really notice the clarity of the picture. The scenery in BD looked fabulous in HD. I also like the idea of having all the xtras on one disc. Hot Fuzz has 3+ hrs of xtras alone!! If your not ready to spend more to get a Blu-Ray player then this is a good introductory product for the HD market. Enjoy!!
3,good,"good, but could've gotten it for way cheaper elsewhere cuz HD wanna get their dvd players in everyones house hold."
3,Better wait for a while to get this.,"Hi,I got this HD-DVD player from Toshiba at May 2007. The price was aboce $300. To be honest, I think it is not a hurry to get this. Wait for price drop would be a better idea. Since after I get this and watched several HD-DVDs, yes, they are better but not worthy of another $300 if you already have a progressive dvd player. The drawback for this is it power up slow, read disc slow, and sometimes it will stuck there and even can not power off. All I can do is unplug the power cord."
3,Havent seen the difference,"I bought it a month ago and have watched ~ 10 HD movies and cant really tell the difference. The only thing i noticed is that it takes 5 times longer to boot up than a regular dvd player (event if you just want to take the DVD out) so I will only use it if the DVD is HD, otherwise I use my old player. Sound is better specially when I am using my home theather.HUGE CONS: if you stop the movie and want to play it back, you have to either select the scene from the menu or fast foward the movie. It really sucks if you want to stop it and continue the next day."
4,Works Great... Too bad Toshiba Screwed Us,Love the unit but it is worthless now. I would not be surprised to see a class action suit against Toshiba. I will not buy Toshiba products ever again.
1,This is actually a rating on Amazon more than the dvd player,When an item drops from $240 down to $140 in 2 months you would expect some kind of relief from a company like Amazon. Especially given the fact you have purchased 60 items plus over 2-1/2 years time. All I got from customer no service was I sorry I cannot do anything about it. Oh well there are other places to spend my money that want to make their customers happy. So long Amazon.
5,Awesome HD DVD Player!,"I shopped around for awhile and decided on this HD-A2 and I'm glad I did! I read the many great reviews and dived right in with Amazon's great price. The image quality with my Samsung LNT4661F LCD 1080p truly delivers sharp and crisp resolution. Sure, slow start up, but, whatever...it doesn't bother me. The results are amazing. I currently have the 2.1 firmware upgrade. Make yourself happy and get this HD DVD player! Enjoy!"
2,Hate the thing,"The picture is outstanding, but lately it has been crashing on me. It will just stop at a random point. Brand new discs even stop and give me an error code; then, I have to go around back and unplug the player just to get the disc out. Going to return it and hope for the best, but from what I've read, other people are experiencing similar problems."
2,Good but locks up almost every other disk.,I wasn't too impressed at first with this player until I put in Planet Earth which was filmed in HD after which I was amazed.I do have a few major gripes.....it takes forever to start up. I turn it on and I am stuck looking at a blank screen for minutes till it finally glitches a bit then I see the intro screen. It just takes WAY too long to start.I also found that it locked up every other disk or so.....many times hitting eject locks it up. Turning it on locks it up many times. Pausing it locks it up but it is not always.......just what seems like every other disk.When it locks up all I can do it either physically hold down the power button on the player for 30 - 60 seconds till it eventually turns off or unplug it from the back and cross my fingers that it won't lock up when I turn it on again.When it works it is a fine player.....but when it doesn't it just pisses me off.
3,Aggravating player.,"Picture is great. But, there are several issues that are a pain-in-the-butt.First off, if you are watching anything and hit stop to go into the setup, or even shut the player off, and then go back to the show, the player starts the show over. Most regular players will pick up where you left off. I've called support. They tell me that not all discs have that option. Huh? I have 8 movies and none of them do it. I don't have the problem on a couple of SD DVDs that I've tried.Secondly, if I put in a SD DVD and try to start it in anything other then 480 an error message will be displayed that states it is an illegal operation and will automatically change the setting to 480p. If you are playing the disc and stop it to enter the setup to make the change the player will automatically turn the format into 4:3. Support says it's normal. I also have a Sony DVP-NS90V for upconverting and I don't have a problem with that.[...] Great picture, tho."
1,Extremely Poor DVD Player,"We purchased a Toshiba HD TV and this HD DVD player in 2007. It was the single worst choice on my part. Considering other reviews and the compatibility factor, this should have been a slam dunk. Let me tell you - first it takes FOREVER to turn it on and be able to insert a DVD - then the sound starting going silent when I would forward too much at one time. Then, no sound. The disc had to be restarted to get the sound back! The other major issue is the remote. Who actually tested this thing out? The remote control is sleek and BLACK. So, if you're thinking of being able to pause, fast fwd or find ""menu"". you either memorize where these buttons are - or turn the lights up considerably in order to read them! This is the first time I've experienced such a piece in a Toshiba product. I always read Amazon's product reviews before purchasing - Please don't waste your time and money on this one."
3,Can't put a disc in for 35 seconds after power on,"So, after hooking it up (which, let's face it, you only do once and with HDMI it's pretty trivial), what's your daily interaction with a DVD player?Why, you turn it on, change the disk, and start to watch it, right?Prepare to be frustrated EVERY SINGLE time you do this sequence. My old DVD player would open the drawer within about 3 seconds of power on. This one takes 35 seconds (I timed it). This really irritates me, as I'm standing there waiting to watch a movie.The trailers and legal disclaimers at the beginnings of movies are bad enough (but every player has those). This one adds another half minute of frustration to every movie watching experience.FYI, it's a linux-driven system (so that 30 seconds probably represents system boot time)."
2,"Very, very disappointing.","Most of the issues have been covered here, in short, this player is not ready for prime time. The issues that I have experienced include:- Very long boot and power down times.- Impenetrable rigmarole to connect to the Internet (I ended up downloading the firmware update on my PC and burning a disk).- Random lockups that require removing the power cord.- Display of regular DVDs in an odd letterbox mode. Hard to describe, imagine a letterbox image that does not fill the screen either top to bottom or side to side at the same time. Does not happen for all DVDs. Toshiba Customer Service never responded to my questions.- Most annoying is the lack of ""memory"" if you remove a disk without finishing it (or turning the machine off). What happens is that rather than starting where you left off, you have to chapter search. Really a pain.It really would be worth your while to wait until this machine leaves beta test."
1,Very little difference,"After having purchased this particular brand of HD player, I only had a few days to watch it before it refused to operate any more. However, after watching a few HD movies, I cannot see what all the fuss is about. There is a little difference in the vividness of colors, but other than that, there is so little difference between an HD DVD and a regular DVD, it just doesn't seem that it's worth the price to change over. One thing that is extremely aggravating about this HD player is the time it takes to operate. Every action on the player seems to react in slow motion. Maybe it is just a fault in this particular player, but waiting 2 minutes for the disc door to open is just a bit much. This is only my second purchase of a Toshiba product, but as of this writing, it is probably going to be the last."
1,"Buyer Beware, not truely HD","I purchased this product to work with my hi-def TV set and found out this player can only play video in 1080i! Why in the world would Toshiba make a HD-DVD player output in interlaced 1080!I want the highest resolution in progressive, not interlaced!The flickering in interlaced is annoying, I returned this product and purchased a real Hi-def player that can output in 1080P.Don't even think about buying this player, the price is too good to be true!"
2,not impressed,"1. Takes more than 30 seconds to boot2. The GUI for changing date/time is non-intuitive. Expects you to enter dates and times with the numeric keypad, but does not tell you that on the screen.3. The internet connection is useless. I expected to be able to get a web browser to control the device by, or be able to query its status via SNMP or something. But it does nothing of the sort. It appears to only be useful to update the firmware and limit my choices using DRM.4. There is no way to select NTP servers in the network setup; they are hard-coded and cannot be set from DHCP. Lose in today's NAT'ed world.5. The stupid box refused to oversample a regular DVD without an HDMI cable.I can only hope that future revisions of the firmware will address some of these issues."
4,Best Bang for your Buck for HD and regular DVDs,"Upconversion is better than any other similarly priced regular DVD player on the market including the overpriced OPPOs. Yes, the boot time is slow, but you get used to it. Bought mine for $130."
4,"Great, low-cost HD-DVD player","This item has been replaced by the HD-A3, but has nearly identical specs.Pros: Cheap, great image quality, ethernet connection for downloading firmware upgrades and for online content, HDMI output, upscales your old dvd's.Cons: Not 1080p (1080i), slow to boot up.Got this and the Samsung 1400 Blu-Ray player for around $525 combined. A great way to be format-neutral for high definition dvds. My friend got the 1080p version (for $300 more), and I can't tell the difference, although he swears he can. Looks great on my Pioneer plasma, especially with ""Planet Earth""."
5,Superb!!,This is the unit you need for hi-def source. Why bother to pay more for Blu-ray for the same video quality?
4,"Great player, a few flaws","Believe everything good you read about the picture and audio from HD DVD. Stunning and etc. Better than anything you see as ""hi def"" from your local TV station, satellite company or cable TV. Full-tilt high definition.However.Early HD and Blu-ray players have issues. They are getting better, and this one is much better than Toshiba's last model, for sure.But they suffer from longish bootup delays (~1 minute from power on to tray opening), and jerky fast forward and rewind. This is probably due to the computer-based system inside each unit. It's not Windows, of course, but it still takes a bit of time to boot up, and has processing delays that show up when you change the direction of play.Almost there. Then again, at the price, it no longer hurts so bad knowing you're going to want to upgrade in a couple of years."
2,Not that great,"Picture quality is great when you are playing an HD disk. However, playback for regular DVD's is spotty. Half if the time you need to turn off the deck and restart it, just so the signal is sent to DVI. Most of the time, the deck also gives a message something like this disk is not authorized for 1080 output, reverting to 480. Thus you lose the upconvert capability. It's ok for the price and being one of the few HD players out there, but as soon as something better comes out this thing is toast."
4,"Amazing picture quality, but troublesome","When everything works, this machine makes a gorgeous image on my Sony crt hdtv. It is slower to start and load than a standard dvd player. Updating the operating system is very inconvenient and time-consuming. The 5 'free' hd-dvd movies in the special offer took over 3 months to arrive and they didn't send all the movies I ordered, but made a substitute without explanation. Rented hd-dvd's are frequently flawed and won't play - the hd-dvd's seem to be more fragile than standard dvd's. Standard dvd's look very much better played on the Toshiba than they look when played on the same hdtv using a standard dvd player."
4,Almost perfect...,"The HD-DVD videos are amazing. My only gripes about this machine is the super slow startup times. Even my windows desktop loads faster than this box! Plus, it has been about 2 months and I haven't received my free HD-DVDs yet either. The same goes for the PS3 free bluray DVDs."
1,"Buggy, unreliable, noisy.","Don't believe the free HD-DVD offer. After you wait the 8-10 weeks and call for info about your discs, you will receive the same answer over and over again - ""Your DVD's are ready and will ship very soon"". I have been waiting for nearly 4 months and have heard that reply each time I have called. Went through this a few years ago with a different manufacturer and never got anything per their agreement. Don't look to Amazon to help you resolve the problem, you will have to go directly to your credit card company and have them force a return/refund of the product. Believe me, $240 for a unreliable HD player (only plays 3 out of every 4 discs on a good day) and no free discs is not a very good deal. Shop elsewhere and ignore the free disc bait. A friend went the free disc route with a another HD player earlier this year and by the time he got his discs, they were out of the ones he wanted, so they sent ""alternates"". AVOID. AVOID. AVOID. Nuff said."
4,"Great picture, a little slow",The HD DVD pic is great. The only criticism (minor) is that the loading time is a little slow.
2,"Nice at First, But Severe Durability Issues","So this product is a pretty neat thing. It's classy looking, and it does keep drinks nice and cool. I had some cans of pop in here for a couple days with ice, and even when it was warmer out, the ice lasted. I was impressed. Until, that is...the sun shined on the cooler. BLAM - the lid cracked and exploded into about 10 pieces. I was quite surprised when I came home and walked out on the deck to see that. I'm bummed. I've written Coleman customer service to see what they can do, and will update this review accordingly."
5,Nice Cooler,"This is a classy way to keep your beverages cold at a party. No need to bend over to get your beers. Even though the lid does not contain insulation, it keeps everything cold for a very long time (as in overnight)."
3,"Nice cooler, but not durable","I loved this cooler when we first got it, but after a week, the top of the cooler broke in about 10 pieces because of the heat outside. Since this is an outdoor cooler, I didn't even think this could happen, and we were very dissappointed with the quality."
3,"Good, but not great","I cannot say that I would recommend these, or buy them again for that matter. They seemed to feel good for about a week, and then the elastic started stretching, and the metatarsal pad seemed to wear thin. I will use them every now an then if I am in extreme pain, but am still looking for something better."
2,sore feet,These are clunky to wear and clean. they are a waste of money. I need more mortons neuroma help! I wish there was more out there
2,disappointing,The sock doesn't pull onto your foot as far as the picture shows. You can not pull the sock on far enough to get the pad to the position it needs to be in. It's also a snug fit on a women's medium width foot.
2,Not comfortable,I have a large women's foot - size 11 and these are way too small. They start to cut into my skin after a little bit of wear and become incredibly uncomfortable. Especially in the seperation between the big and second toe.
2,Bad for Mortons Neuroma,This item was said to relieve mortons neuroma. It made it worse by squeezing the foot and placing more pressure on the nerve. Made it terrible!
5,Foot saver,These are GREAT. I have a neuroma between my metatarsal bones. This really relieves the pain. I wear these in my dressy shoes/boots- too thick for high heels though.I don't recommend them in your running shoes-feels weird. But I have worn them during weight training and they are fine. They really relieve my pain. I definatley recommend these.
3,FootSmart Metatarsal Sleeve,The Metatarsal sleeve was adequate. The cushion isn't exactly as the picture shows. The cushion is very thin and pretty much decreases to just a little bit of cushion when worn. So I am giving it three stars. Thanks for asking.
3,Soft and ugly,It does what it's supposed to but it's like a half sock and gets loose throughput the day. Ok if you don't walk around a lot and are mainly standing in one spot
4,Helps alot!,"I recently started have alot of pain in the metatarsal area of my left foot. I am a hairdresser and am on my feet for 8-13 hours every day. I purchased these pads and they help so much. I wear them every day and they fit in most of my shoes. Since I only have the problem on one foo,t I filp the one around and switch them off and on so I can wash one ( I recomend letting it air dry). It is very comfortable and easy to wear. It will slide a little if your shoes do not fit snug. I also walk 2 miles almost 5 days a week and that was getting unbearable, this fit great in my walking shoes and I am back out on the road. Hopefully this review helps. ;)"
1,Try a little harder,"This is a collection of simply processed electronic long-winded jingles. He starts with monotonous theme and continues on and on and on using sounds created on an inexpensive electronic keyboard. I love soft atmospheric sounds, but this is repetitive music without soul."
3,"Attractive piece, but not heirloom quality...","While from a distance this is an attractive piece it is your typical ""Made in China"" quality with (upon close inspection) poor craftsmanship. These include visible glue overage, joinery imperfections, & missing screws. I am not dissatisfied as I believe the price represents the quality. Just understand there is not a single piece of wood in this unit as it is manufactured entirely from particle board."
4,Mission Style Jewelry Amoire,"Very nice style, item shipping and delivered with no problems.Heavy to move around but quality of drawers and hardware nice!"
2,Not well made,Item arrived extremely damaged in several places. Not packaged well had to send it back. Very disappointed with the quality.
1,Cheap.,"I recieved the armoire in seven days. Very fast. But, I could tell there was going to be a problem, because the box was smashed in and I could see the armoire before I even opened it. It took my boyfriend and I to open it. When opened, the back top of the armoire had been previoulsly damaged. It had glue on it. The left side of the door had broken off, and there were many scratched on it. Very disappointed. Sent it back. I did order the Wilmington Cherry and Burl because the shipper has high ratings. AtHomeMart."
3,Armoire,"The Mission Oak Jewelry Armoire is a very pretty piece of furniture. The color is a little different than I was expecting; it has more red in it than the picture suggest. The drawers are on wood rails, so they do not glide very easily and the doors on the side do not open with a fluid motion that I was expecting for the price. The Cabinet and drawers are made of press wood, so be careful when handling."
1,Timer is short a few hours!,Timer does not let you use a full 24 hour cycle.You are limited to 9 AM to 12AM....
1,Ridiculous error,"I just started reading this book. On page 2, the author says:""...Neptune's moon Mirander's scarred..."" The planet is Uranus and the moon is Miranda. This is poor editing and a stupid error.I hope this is corrected in future or paperback editions."
4,"This is not Beverly Crawford's ""He's Done Enough"" but another version","This is Tim Bishop Brown's sister Mother singing ""He's Done Enough"" not Beverly Crawford. Beverly Crawford's ""He's Done Enough"" is featured on her CD ""Live from Los Angeles"" on JDI Records. Both are wonderful since it is a great song!"
5,OH.....MY.....GOD!!,My girlfriend didn't want to stop for nothing until the battery on the ring died out.
2,It's like novocaine for my crotch....,"This was fun for the first minute or two, after which it had a numbing effect...Not exactly what I was hoping for! I don't think we'll be using this again..."
1,Didn't work,"This thing just didn't work. At all. I recieved it, opened it, and couldn't use it. Very disappointed!"
3,The High-Performance Two-Stroke Engine,Good read - technical but not necessary to understand all the theory to appreciate the book. Most references are 15 to 20 years old. I was disappointed in no direct application to an engine.
2,Stopped working,"I used this and it worked ok though like others have mentioned it did itch. I did exactly as the instructions said and the first day I did not sweat. Sadly day two I did but not as much as usual so I decided a little bit was better than a lot so I kept on with it. Finally after about 2 weeks it didn't work at all. So I actually thought maybe I did something wrong, I waited a few months and even bought a new roll on in case my first one expired. It didn't even work the first day. So I'd say it's cheap enough if you want to give it a shot but don't expect it to work forever."
1,Temporarily great.,"I used Certain Dri for the first time over a year ago, and the results were fantastic... for a little over 6 months. After that, it was completely ineffective, and actually made my sweating WORSE."
1,Use the Certain Dri Solid if the roll on burns/itches,"I tried the Certain Dri roll on and it burned and itched for well over two weeks. It was so painful that I finally gave up. Luckily, I came across some reviews suggesting the Certain Dri Solid - WAY better! So, if you find that the roll on is painful (and the pain doesn't go away within a week or so) just go straight to the solid. It's amazing!"
2,Doesn't help at all!!!!!!!!!!,"This antiperspirant just the same one as all another, that doesn't keep you underarm area dry. After using my armpits are more sweating, than without!"
1,certainly-break out,"I have a horrible armpit odor problem, I have tried everything it seems like so I bought this and tried it out and it gave me horrible bumps on my armpits, it took forever for them to go away, i was not able to wear anything on my armpits except for Bromi-talc which helped for a few days but stopped as well. I am not sure what to do about my armpit odor problem, it is embarrassing and i just want to find something that works."
5,No better product!,"I used to have a real problem with underarm wetness and those horrible circles on my shirts under the arms. I had tried everything and nothing worked. I've been using this product for about 5 years now, it is incredible. I'm at the point where in the winter I only need to use it once a week, twice a week in the summer and I am totally dry. I put on a deodorant-only product in the AM after I shower and I'm good to go all day and night."
5,It ain't called CertainDry for nothing!,"This product is possibly one of the best OTC items I've purchased to date that's actually effective. If you suffer from excessive sweating from your pits, to the point that you're forced to wear a sweater in scorching temperatures (ya'll know who you are and what I'm babbling about!!) to hide the embarrassing wet marks, this here product works miracles. Anybody who's having issues with excessive sweating that, should at least give this a try. Great stuff!"
5,AMAZING!!,"This stuff really works! I have been suffering from wet armpits since I was 11 years old, and finally at age 35, I found a solution. This 1.2 oz. container lasted me five months. I apply it every 2-4 evenings and am ALWAYS dry! It is amazing."
3,Just doesn't reduce the wetness like it used to.,"When I first got this product, it worked like a charm. I always made sure my armpits are shaven, so it can make full contact on the skin. I never experienced wetness again for a month & it was fantastic. However, these past few months I have been getting more wetness everyday. Don't know what I am doing wrong now compared to the past, I just can't figure it out. So I will rate this 3 stars since it DOES work, but in the long run it might not."
4,MEH!,"Alright, so my sister and i have both had a problem with excessive sweating for a couple of years- me being the one with the worse case. So searching for an answer and solution i came across Certain Dri. I live in Canada and realized it wasn't sold just anywhere. I began looking and got REALLy discouraged because it wasn;t anywhere. And then one day I was in my doctor's office and the pharmacy sold it behind the counter. GREAT! I'M IN LUCK! so i take it home and try it out.. of course my little sister gets to too. IMMEDIATELY my sister saw results and only used the product twice and continues to be sweat free. Although i have seen an improvement, it's been about 2 weeks and the results aren't as good as my sister's were in her first try.SO whatever! i guess i'll continue to be patient.. wish me luck"
5,THE BEST!,"This product SAVED MY LIFE. (This kid's review thing is handy if you don't want to go into a hassle about making yourself a member,huh?) I used to sweat excessivly, for years - it was such an embaressment. I used to wear sweatshirts every day so no one would see. It was horrible. I worried about it constantly. And then I saw this ad for Certi-Dri, and I decided to try it. The rest is history. Although I would add that using it after shaving is a terrible idea (it burns like anything) and it doesn't work so well, on me at least, around my period time (that is, I sweat a little bit then.). Otherwise, it never fails! I love it! I use it every other night (or every third night) and it's fantastic. If you have a sweating problem, BUY THIS! You'll never regeret it.-A 19 year old Fan"
5,No longer break out in sweat.,"So I used Certain Dri. It works! Now I can wear T-shirts and not have to contend with intense sweat circles. It is the early summer and I am able to go about with ease. Yes, it does itch a little bit. Yet perhaps it is like taking some medications-one has to take it at night, and be prepared for some discomfort."
1,Had really high hopes :T,"Im a senior in High School, and I was really hoping his would work for me.I've been using it for about a week, and nothing.It's not as itchy as some people claim it to be, well to me that is.Maybe it just takes time for it to work."
1,no difference,"I bought this with high hopes, but have found that my sweating hasn't changed. Maybe it has decreased slightly, but I still can't wear colored shirts during pressure situations (public speaking, dates) without getting sweat spots. Maybe I got a defective one or it just doesn't work for my body."
2,meh...was hoping for more,"After all the 5-star raving reviews of this product, I was hoping for better results. Maybe I just require something more than the average sweater, because I have always had a SEVERE problem with underarm sweating. So I was excited to try this product. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now, and while I will say that it works better than any other over-the-counter antiperspirant I've ever tried before, it doesn't work like I wanted it too. I still sweat, especially in stressful situations, which is really where I needed it the most.I will continue to use it, b/c it still works the best out of anything I've tried so far, but overall not too pleased.Also, stings like hell when you put it on."
2,Doesn't work for me,bought this because of the previous good reviews but too bad it doesn't work for me. i was about to return it but let my husband give it a try and luckily it did for him for a while.
5,It works!,I have one thing to say. Its works!Just apply at bedtime and its done! I'll buy more and more!
5,Exactly what I needed for my excessive armpit sweating.,"I have tried several kinds of anti-perspirant deodorants in the past, the best of which has been Degree for men (which has Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex GLY at 18.2% vs others around 14%), and none of them were enough to manage my excessive armpit sweating. Many of my t-shirts quickly develop stains in the armpits that never fully wash out and within minutes of putting on a shirt it becomes visibly wet. I've used this (Certain Dri) deodorant three times now, every other evening, in conjunction with daily morning Degree anti-perspirant deodorant, and it has completely solved my sweating problem. At first I was concerned about the health of my pores but so far I've had no irritation or any problems. I do still sweat but at a totally acceptable level and the armpits of my shirts no longer become damp."
2,"Reviews are old, product stops working after a few weeks.","I wanted to give this roll on a try for a few weeks before I'd jump into a definite conclusion. I've been using Certain Dri for about 8 wks now. I bought it at a local pharmacy, wasn't cheap. I followed the instructions and I gotta say that it only helped for the first few applications. After that I started having irritation, itching, skin staining, clothes discolored and the perspiration was back.I stopped using it for about 2 weeks to see if my body had gotten used to the ingredients and perhaps that made it stop working. But that didn't do it. I still wash 2-3 times a day with antibacterial body wash and wear antiperspirant deodorant. Certain Dri seems a temporary fix for a permanent problem. Won't buy it again, it's just wasting money."
5,This is so heavenly,I was desperate to try anything because I was tired of wearing only dark shirts so my sweaty armpits wouldnt show so I tried Certain Dri and it is the bomb. Please give this a try if you have issues with sweating even when you are not that hot.
2,Caused a Psoriasis outbreak in my armpits,"I have mild plaque Psoriasis on my elbows and knees. I never dreamed I would develop new spots in a place like my armpits! But there is was, a couple of days after I started using this product. Sensitive skinned people beware. I wish I had never picked this up."
1,.,"The product does not work. It first came in the mail partially open and all wet on the inside of the package. When trying to use the product, it didn't even work."
5,A PERFECT PRODUCT,"My daughter had a terrible problem with excesive underarm sweating, and thanks to Certain Dri and Certain Dri AM she is free of wet blouses! now she can use dark color blouses and t-shirts with all the confidence of the world. This is a product worth trying."
3,too many side effects,"this product works when it come to stopping sweat. but it leaves the skin in bad condition, it broke my skin out really bad when i was younger my doc. gave me cream to correct it. i tried it again recently because all else started to fail. side effects weren't as bad this time but still, it's too strong, although it helps(the price of beauty i guess). Im going to try something else like maxim for sensitive skin hopefully that works best."
4,Works ok,"I've been using Certain Dri for a few weeks now. So far it is performing much better than anything I've used. I apply it at night before bed every 2 days. There is some itch but not unbearable.I've been mostly dry with it's use, however in stressful situations I still find myself sweating, just not as bad. I dream of the day when I can wear a button down shirt without a t-shirt underneath. That day may never come though."
5,WOW! This stuff works!,"I suffer from a condition known as hyperhidrosis that causes me to have excessive underarm sweat. I would only wear baggy white or black tshirts because I could never wear anything with bright colors b/c I worried I would sweat through them. I could be sitting in an air conditioned room all day and still be sweating. I found Certain Dri on the internet and decided to give it a try. On my FIRST DAY I saw a 150% improvement! I didn't have a single patch of sweat on my shirt! It does itch slightly, but it's nothing unbearable and it is SO worth it! Now I can wear form-fitting COLORED shirts! It makes all the difference in the world!"
2,Certain-Dri PWND,"Applying this product was like experiencing the battle of Thermoplae in my armpits. Have you seen the movie 300? This product was like the spartan warriors holding back 300 thousand Persian warriors. They managed for about three days with fierce fighting (stinging sensation under my arms) and then on the third day they were utterly decimated by the hordes of Persian sweat. It was like if the Hoover dam imploded and wiped Las Vegas off the map. Since that time my sweat glands have ""leveled up"" to ""grandmaster sweat wizard"" status and can thoroughly vaporize a shirt in 4 minutes flat."
3,Kellie,"I used this product for the first time 10 years ago and for a few months it was like I had been given a new life...I could finally wear whatever shirt I wanted without the fear of sweating through it, and the odor that came with excessive perspiration as well. I could finally wear clothing that made me feel like a woman rather than large black or white t-shirts looking like a man. Sadly after a few months my skin became very irritated by the product, I scratched myself raw and the sweating continued. I give this product 3 stars only because of the disappointment I encountered after a few months, if the product had not caused me severe irriation it would have been 5 stars without a doubt. Ten years later I am still battling excessive perspiration, I am now trying the drionic...fingers crossed."
5,Thank you Certain Dri!,"I am a 13 year old girl who had the problem of excessive sweating. I could never wear form-fitting shirts because I would develop a ring of perspiration that was very embarrassing. I would wear sweatshirts and loose shirts to avoid those icky sweat stains. I went through many a deodorant, trying to find a good one. I tried Secret, Suave, Ban, Soft & Dri, and Lady Speed Stick. None of them even reduced my sweating! So I saw Certain Dri and got some.This product works wonders! I just tried some last night, and today I wore a form-fitting shirt. NO embarrassing sweat stains! My shirt and underarms are completely dry!! I didn't experience any discomfort or stinging like other reviewers, just dry underarms!If you sweat more than you like, I highly reccommend this product!"
2,"It Works a Bit, but OWwWwW!","As a female, excessive sweating I think is almost worse than it is for a man. Mine is pretty bad. I turned to Certain Dri, hoping it would help - and it does, a little. It's not a miracle worker by any means, but at this point, even a little something is a big help.But don't listen to the reviews that say there is some 'minor' irriation - it burns and cause a red itchy rash. This is made even worse if you put it on freshly shaved skin - YiKeS! I'll never do that again! Seriously, it can be very painful. I only use it when I absolutely have to."
2,Can't Tell a Difference,"I've been using this product for about a month now and have not been able to tell a difference. I'm going to keep trying it until the canister is empty, but at this point I'm pretty disappointed."
3,not happy,"I have been using Certain Dri for a week now and i saw a decrease in the amount of sweat, but i still have about 2 inch sweat rings. I am very upset because I thought this would work considering all the good reviews. I do not know of any other deodorant that I can buy at a drug store that is as strong. If anyone has suggestions, please notify me. Believe me, I will be VERY grateful if I can solve this ongoing problem."
2,works as a regular deodorant,"I purchased this for my husband and he says that it works as a regular deodorant, not for excessive perspiration. He sweats a lot and unfortunately this did not work for him."
4,Certain dry works well!,"Works well, don't skip a night or you'll stink the next day! Better than ""regular"" antiperspirants/deoderants."
1,Total waste for me...,"I ordered this product online in the hopes that it would work, based on the great reviews I've seen. I've always had a problem with perspiration and neither the Secret or Degree Clinical worked with me. I applied it as directed, but the product is like water! It was hard to use the dry little roller top because there was no type of lubrication...it just seemed like water. It ran down my sides, actually. Quite messy. It did not sting or itch and I even used it after shaving. Took a while to dry, and didn't work at all. I felt sticky all day. I'm very disappointed. And the price is totally unwarranted, especially since there is no deodorant involved, just anti-perspirant."
1,uhh...,"It doesn't work for me, at all. I followed all of the instructions carefully and I haven't seen any change."
3,Hear good things,"This past summer, I was looking for something that would keep me from sweating so much under my arms and I came across this product while I was researching online. Although, I have yet to try it I believe it can do what it says that's why I related it as just okay."
5,hmm,"well by looking at the other review, it seems to me that it should work unless u have a chemical imbalance in which cause u'd need oral medication."
1,A normal 14 year old girl,"I am you typical 14 year old girl, and my underarms started over persperating about 4 months ago. I thought Certain Dri would help my problem, but instead it made my arms sting, and it did not help AT ALL! One thing that helped me though was Secret Deodarant. Do not waste your money on this product."
5,This product changed my life,"What can I say that already hasn't been said? I'm in my mid 30s and have been battling pretty serious underarm sweating since high school. I tried *everything* to mask the problem...multiple shirts, jackets, undershirts with underarm pads, you name it. Nothing worked - I simply soaked right through anything I threw at the problem. At work? What a nightmare. I either avoided or escaped situations where I had to get in front of a group. Talk about a career limiting issue.Then I found this product, and.....wow! The sweating has *completely* disappeared, even after 2 or 3 days without usage. Certain Dri is a miracle in a 1.2 fl oz bottle. The only complaint is underarm discomfort if too much product is used, and a little compensentory sweating in other areas.I would easily pay 4x time price.Thank you Certain Dri!"
5,Finally......,"After trying just about every product on the market and stopping short of trying Men's deodorant, I had given up hope that I could find something to stop this embarrassing problem. Everyday (for years and years) I have had the problem of excessive underam sweating and was just desperate to find something to stop it. Every shirt has pit stains, I was terribly self-conscious when even slightly raising my arm. I would be soaked from the minute I left home until the minute I changed after getting home from work. Until now! This product absolutely works. From the very first day I have had no underarm wetness. I never thought I could find something like this! I would absolutely (and already have) recommend this product to people with this problem. Like many others have noted, there is some burning and itching when you first begin to use it, but it tapers off after several uses. I can handle a little burn to get results like this!"
4,wow!,"Hi everyone, i bought this priduct from cvs not online, and ive used it so far for 3 days and had a decrease in sweating, allthough it doesnt get rid of sweating all together, read the fine print on the back it ""reduces"" sweat, which is fine with me cuz nothing else out there has the same effect as certain dry does.i apply it on at night and apply deoderant the next morning which combined is the perfect solution.since last year i have been sweating alot not like anyone else, and day after day i would be made fun of because the deoderant i was using was not strong enough and it was making me smell bad, and everyone was makng fun of me day after day, i wanted to kill myself, until i started using this stuff, it works!!!!, now i could have my life back!!!"
5,"Finally, a product that works!","Worked like a charm for me. I've used it every three days at night for two weeks and have not had any underarm sweat issues. Finally, I can relax about annoying armpit sweat. I find that it stings a bit. I don't know if this would work for someone with profuse underarm sweat though. It's worth trying though."
4,Seems to work,"I hate sweaty armpits at work and it seems to happen to me a lot! Its embarassing being in a meeting and trying your best to remember to keep your arms down! I've started to use this and it really seems to help so far. It doesn't burn like the Dr prescribe stuff did years ago when I used to use that. I use it at night with dry armpits (which is important so it doesn't burn!) I would sugges wearing a white shirt when you put this on however because it will ""bleach"" a colored shirt. I will continue to use this product."
5,The best book for DYI wood finishing,"In order to make our kitchen remodeling dollars go further we bought unfinished oak cabinets. After looking at lots of recomendations online I found some tips by Bob Flexnor. They were so well written that I decided to buy this book before attempting to finish them. I was not disappointed. Bob writes from much experience and his techniques are easy to understand. I would highly recommend this book for anyone considering finishing their own cabinets or furniture. BTW, the cabinets look great and it was easy."
5,Literally classic,"A superb book, every woodworker should own it. I don't understand how anyone could possibly rate it less than 5 stars. I'd give it 6 if I could."
4,Ancient Wisdom - much to ponder,"I think that proverbs offer a treasure of wisdom and practical advice. This book does exactly that - it's a compilation of ancient Japanese wisdom which very applicable in the 21st century. Fantastic translation but I wish there were some notes that gave a little explanation to at least some proverbs that are hard to understand.Overall, 4 stars for the collection and translation."
4,Claudio Arrau - Wonderful Chopin,"Claudio Arrau is widely considered by many to be one of the greatest pianists of the 20th century. This collection contains many of Chopin works including the rarely performed pieces for Piano and Orchestra such as Rondo a la krakowiak, Fantasy on Polish Airs and Variations on Mozart's La ci darem la mano. Like most of Arrau's works, the Chopin is played very seriously, at slower tempo, but nevertheless is superb. The Preludes, Nocturnes are recommended the most, but this collection is a must have for any Arrau fan. Other Chopin fans my want to consider works performed by Artur Rubinstein, Samson Francois or Maurizio Pollini."
3,Hilarious,"Remember ""Whoomp, There It is?"" Seven years later, 95 South managed to create an album with no discernible amount of progression from their original 1993 hit. Every song on this album sounds the same. Every song is about booty. And every song is hilarious and completely danceable. At $0.01 (current lowest price for this CD), how could you go wrong?"
4,hmmm....good....,"Well, these are not Awesome cds, but they are good.The sound quality is not the best.Anyways, the songs selection is pretty good. If you want to hear good live stuff buy this.Also I recomend Liveage, which I think is better than this cd."
1,Burnt out after a short time.,"I bought 2 of these. The first one lasted less than a week and the other one, not even a couple of months. Big waste of money!!"
1,It burnt out in 35 days!,"This light bulb burnt out in 35 days which was after the 30 return window, so I guess I am out of luck. I have bought them at the reptile store and they usually last 6 months. Very disappointed!"
1,Second Bulb Just like the first... less then 40 days of life,We are now on our second bulb for our Bearded Dragons. This time the bulb lasted less then 30 days. The first one lasted 35. Don't buy their products. They are cheaply built with no quality control. Stay away!
1,Horrible,"Definately not worth the $. I wouldn't of even spent a dollar on it. I don't know if I got a bad bulb or what but I just got my bulb in not even a week ago, and it just blew.Definately not worth it....."
5,Nice and bright!,I opened the package and the light wasn't broke like I had feared it would be. It screwed in nicely into the lamp and it lit up lovely and kept a nice steady glow. Loved it!
1,Dud of a lightbulb,"I've had many, many bulbs for our turtle as he's 5 yrs old. Bought this, thinking it was a good deal. Unfortunately we've only had the bulb in since New Year's Eve (10 hrs a day) and it's already burned out. Not a good lifespan. I will never order anything from Exo Terra again :("
2,they do not last,"They simply do not last and are not worth the cheaper price. I bought 8 of these and all of them were gone within 6 months. After the first 3 went out so fast i even bought a new lamp thinking that was the problem. Buy a longer lasting flood lamp light that does the same thing as a ""reptile"" bulb for 2x the price that lasts 8 times 1 of these."
2,Short life...burned out quicky,Purchased from B & J Pets and Aquariums. Bulb burned out only 90 days after putting into use. It only lasted 720 hours. Would not buy from them again.
2,Very disappointing,While the scale works as a scale the USB connection is completely non-functioning and worse the company did not respond to any of my emails and phone calls.Avoid this company and its products!
4,This works better if you have the hardware,"This book does offer a lot of suggestions for wearing scarves, but a lot of them require the use of a scarf clip, slide or pin. Plus, I don't know about the other women out there, but I'm just not interested in using a scarf as a belt--or to accentuate the hips! It is nice, however, that she gives examples for both square and oblong scarves."
2,""". . . and my next move was brilliant!""","If you liked the movie ""Searcing for Bobby Fischer,"" don't read this book, because it will totally destroy your image of Josh Waitzkin. He was egotistical and hell-bent on winning, not the sweet boy who simply loved to play chess. Why did he retire from chess at age 15? Maybe because new, more talented players were coming on the scene, and he couldn't stand to lose. I don't know. Now, about the book: besides the annoying, egotistical narrative, he simply doesn't explain chess very well. His famous teacher Bruce Pandolfini did it much better, so I recommend Pandolfini's books instead."
2,"Great Player, lousy book","Like many younger players, I'm a fan of Josh Waitzkin, but it seems like he didn't really try to do anything with this book. The book should actually be titled Waitzkins Best Combinations, as that and some good prose is all the book contains. In essence, you won't learn to attack like Josh Waitzkin by reading this book. Skip it and go to Vuvoviks The Art of Attack in Chess, the best on this topic. And if you really want this book, you can have mine."
2,More basice than I thought it would be,If you know nothing about Chess -- this is a great place to start. If you have an average level of knowledge about the game -- you will quickly become bored with this.
3,Worthwhile tactical review and stories.,This is by no means for Advanced players. I enjoyed the stories and found it a useful review of some strategy and many tactics. I suggest you don't look at the solutions/game continuations till you have worked out a reasonable idea on your own. If read in this manner the book can act as a challenging test. Not the best I've read. Mainly because it was aimed at to broad an audience. May have been better if the scope was narrowed. I recomend you try to find it used for under $8. It isn't worth more than this even new.
4,Josh Waitzkin,"Heh, I just played Josh W in a 3 grueling chess games....I'm an average player, and hes a grand master...and ofcourse he won...Oh yeah about his book, buy it if you're a beginner, but as for pre-interm and higher, don't bother...goto the library and look up chess... also pick up Chess Master 7000 from the stores, it's a great version to help you with your passion of chess."
4,Entertaining Coverage of Chess Basics,"Josh Waitzkin, the inspiration for the main character in the film ""Searching for Bobby Fischer"" presents the theory and principles behind his style of chess. He was an outstanding player, and although never having reached the heights of some of the most prominent Grand Masters he is still of immense intrigue.Waitzkin is both engaging and informative; he truly communicates the beauty and complexities of the game. The book is a compilation of both chess principles mixed with a bit of autobiographical commentary as the vast bulk of games and puzzles presented are his own. The material is weighted more for the beginner chess player, those rated 1500 or below. But even for those well above, Waitzkin's presentation is engaging enough to make it worth a quick rehashing of ideas."
3,An easy read. Light on Chess,"This is a nice interesting book and an easy read. It is pretty light on chess. Waitzkin shows you about two games per chapter and asks you to figure out his next move based upon the theme of the chapter. So in the chapter on pins, you get to think through a couple of pin problems.However, he doesn't really generalize to any rules to think about. You won't walk away really knowing anything well.Given that, the book is kind of fun and light. Waitzkin (either Josh or Fred) is a good writer and the book is enjoyable."
2,Fortune Children - Stand-in-Bride,"Book looks in excellent condition. Have returned to school so I am personally grounded from reading for recreation until 2010. Read ""The Wolf and The Dove"" of the Fortune Series and got intrigued with the murder plot of the grandmother. Will be very interested in how it turns out."
1,Two bulbs have burned out within 2 months,It seems that these bulbs have about 30 day usage with limited number of hours per day. Have to find different brand.
5,Good Light,The light is working well. We have not had any problems. I would order this light again. I give it an A+.
5,Excellent stuff,"This is an outstanding piece of work, A must have! I listened to it everyday for 2 weeks after buying it first and it still got a twice a week listen after 6 months. Now as the years have passed it has become a firm favorite.Soulful voice, Clever lyrics, Beautiful melodies, Reminders of Elvis Costello & Paddy McAloon at their best."
5,Reformation Study Bible,"This is a wonderful translation, an ""easy read"". The introductory essays and footnotes are marvelous study aids. I use this Bible daily. I plan to give one to my mother for Christmas. I really like the leather cover, but I think as much as I will be using this, the hardbound may have been a better choice, and be longer-lasting and more robust."
5,Great Bible in paperback format,Ordered this paperback format to give to an inmate - Great study Bible on Reformed tradition - well worth the cost
4,One of the Best Reference Bibles,"The description was stated as ""new condition"" although it had quite a few notes written in the front few pages as well as in the margins throughout Genesis. Not that big of a deal because we love this version which lays out the covenants of God very clearly."
5,Great Bible,"I love how this is written and is close to the original Hebrew and Greek, as well as the Sovereign God and Grace oriented study notes."
5,Good seller...Beautiful Bible!!!!,"Excellent. Bible. I don't collect them, but I do buy them to give away. I like to buy a Bible that I would like to keep for myself, so that I don't give away something that I wouldn't want. What would that be? It works for me anyway. Thanks for the beautiful, very good selection!! PTL!"
5,Excellent Bible,The ESV is an excellent combination of accuracy in translation along with readability. The theology of the study bible commentary is very sound and consistent with scripture. The only change I would make is to add the reference tabs.
5,A must have item.,This Bible is great! It really brings so much info and understanding. It is truly a must have for anyone serious about bible study.
5,The Reformation Study Bible,This is an excellent quality made Bible. I have the NKJV version of this Bible and I have enjoyed it for years.
3,Great Notes and Version QUALITY poor,"I love the ESV, I love most of the notes that I have read so far. The leather on this bible is not of top quality, marginal at best. There are no color maps in the back of the Bible. Words of Christ are not in red. The paper quality is average. Overall I would wait for the second edition of this Bible to come out or wait for another ESV study bible to come out. I wish it was of better quality, my Bible gets heavy use and I can not afford to mark one up and memorize where passages and notes are only to have it fall apart in a few years, which is my fear with the quality of this bible."
3,I'd buy the hardcover edition if I had to do it again...,"The binding, though ""genuine leather"", does not look or feel very well made. The craftmanship is more of an award Bible with a genuine leather cover, unlike Bibles you would buy from, say, Oxford University Press or Zondervan."
3,"Great Translation, Weak Notes!","I was hoping for more. While I love the ESV translation I was looking for a comprehensive study Bible that really brought out Reformed and Calvinist theology for comparison with the text of Scripture. I found it lacking specifically on the difficult passages where little or no notes were given to adequately defend or even promote Reformed theology. I was hoping for in depth, coherent and informative notes from beginning to end. While helpful and a great translation I believe it comes up short of the title ""Reformation Study Bible"" in regards to Reformed theology anyway."
4,"Sansa e260, e280 Flexiskin","Not bad, but it is a bit tough to slide the player inside. But you don't want to have this too loose otherwise it may drop out while running. It is tight, so it makes the rotating volume knob soemwhat tough to operate, but you can get used to it. While wearing it it stays firm on your arm, the armband is very comfortable, it velcros all the way so there is nothing flapping in the wind or catching your body. There is a cutout for the docking slot, and for the memory slot. The 4 buttons are covered by the rubber, but they are marked, and they don't bother the operation much. The power button gets covered by the rubber, so you may want to remember where it is in case you want to turn it on/off while the Flexiskin is on. In all, it is worth the money, it works well, and enables the use of a much smaller unit than some of those old Sony running radios/walkman, etc."
1,Creased paper,"I've owned Brother printers in the past. I bought this as an upgrade. Unfortunately it creases paper randomly and regularly. I can't use it for anything but personal printing (where I can overlook the creases) unless I print multiple pages and use the ones that aren't creased. Wastes a lot of ink and paper. If you're in the market for a printer, look elsewhere."
2,Bad Brother,"This unit is practically new,purchased from Brothermall May 4,2007. Arrived making a very loud squeaking noise which ran us crazy.They were great and sent down a new drum and toner assembly.When the toner ran out this week I ordered another at $99 from Brothermall. When their new toner would not fit their new drum I called and was informed that I would have to buy a new drum at $188.99 since the one they sent in May was out of 90 day warranty !!! So...to get this almost new $160 printer running I need to spend $99 + $188.99 , a total of $448 in 6 months !!! Beware of this company."
2,Forget printing envelopes,"I have been a Brother printer user for years - and have had good experiences with all Brother products except my current printer, an HL-5240. In spite of following every Brother guideline and telephone instruction, and in spite of trying many different kinds of (#10) envelopes, this printer simply cannot print a #10 envelope without creasing it. For my purposes, this makes it just about useless. Brother has been no help; its customer service people merely state the obvious (about how to print envelopes) and suggest using different kinds of raw stock (which I have - even though this obviates using my own printed stationary). Nothing has solved the problem. If you don't need to print envelopes, this is a fine printer -- if you do need to print envelopes, look elsewhere."
3,when you already have full cartridges- a new printer is a buy,Our old HL-5240 worked great for three years and then died suddenly and completely. Plenty of newer more capable printers & printer combo's out there but adding up the sunk cost of three brand new HL-5240 cartridges waiting in our cabinet to be used makes the decision easy. Plus the HL-5240 price point dropped to $169 from the $260 range. All we do is print black & white real estate documents so this unit works for us.
1,Common Defect in this Printer - AVOID!,"I purchased this printer for it's fast printing speed and long life in toner and drum, but it's really been a let down. The printer has this habit of creasing and wrinkling the paper on the first 2 pages of every print out. So now I have to send 3 copies of everything I want to the printer, wasting paper and ink. I've tried different kinds of paper, and every troubleshooting option offered to me by the fine folks at Brother, but it continues to do this. I've looked around the Internet, and found this is a common defect in the 5240 and 5250 models. It's really an inconvenience, and now I have to purchase a new printer because it's such a pain. If you love to be frustrated and angered over print quality and paper use, this is the printer for you. Otherwise, avoid at all costs."
1,"Creases paper, Jams",Have two of these printers. Both began creasing the center of paper after a short period of use. Creases got worse and they started to jam. Went to Brother online tech support. Was told to use other paper. Emailed back that I used high quality paper but was told that was the cause. Not so. This seems to be a common problem with this printer and Brother will not acknowledge. Past Brother printers work great. Not sure I will try another Brother.
4,An excellent low cost high-speed laser printer,"After a couple of weeks of use, this printer exceeds my expectations. It is a truly an excellent low cost high-speed laser printer. The quality of printing is superb. My only negative is the high wattage of electricity that it draws when it awakes from the sleep mode. Each time it awakes,it causes my battery backup to beep."
1,wrinkles paper,"Like the other reviews you have, above, this line of printers wrinkles paper.The trouble shooting is of no help.Using the two-blue tabs at the back of the printer and flipping themcan be of temporary assistance.Beyond that, the Brother line of printers appears to have a defect thatthey just cannot correct.Brother: There is a bug in the printer. There is also a bug in the process bywhich people are able to register these defects. So, the printer is buggy andthe people are defective for not admitting there is a bug. How about putting up aweb page to allow people to register their bugs with this printer?All: Perhaps it is time for a class action lawsuit."
5,Great emergency light,"Great emergency light. The night light burns yellow and works well, but it's a bit bright if you plan to keep this in your bedroom. Love the outlet plug in front of the light. Liked it so much I bought a few as gifts for my family. Nice bright light when the power goes out!"
1,They're dead when you need them..,"The flashlight stopped working after 3 months, probably due to low quality rechargeable batteries that wont recharge any more. Who knows.Bottom line - chances are that when you'll need it, it wont be working.Unless you swap them with new ones every couple of months of course..These lights are dangerous as far as I'm concerned, because they are giving the illusion of safety when it comes to an emergency situation.I recommend spending a bit more on something more reliable than these."
1,"""FAILURE "" being the key word!","I ordered 3 of these lights at once. I followed the enclosed instructions to the letter....very simple...then I turned off the main breaker switch in my house (creating same conditions as a power failure). Two never came on; one came on very briefly (less than 3 minutes) and then went out. Complete failure! I thought I could give it 0 stars, but the lowest you can go is 1. It really didn't deserve any stars. Enough said.Intermatic PR3C Three-in-One Emergency Power Failure Light"
3,A little behind the times,"We received one of these from my employer (Earth day giveaway, I believe) back in 2000 or 2001. It is supposed to act as a night light while the rechargeable battery inside ensures that, when the power goes off, the night light stays on. When unplugged, it can be used as an emergency flashlight. Additional convenience is provided by its pass through front power outlet.Many years later, the rechargeable battery is completely dead but I do remember having used it as a flashlight a couple of times in the past. It's still acting as a night light in one of our bathrooms but the light it produces is no longer bright enough to be used on a staircase.At this time (2009) this item represents old technology. Current LED-based lights that usually turn themselves off during the day are a lot more power efficient. As for emergency flashlights, a wide variety of inexpensive, usually LED-based crank devices are available - we have a few."
4,Safety lights that work,These light so far...do what they are supposed to do. Great price for additional safety lighting.
1,Extremely unreliable,"I bought a number of these for the obvious reason of providing emergency lighting in a power failure. Regrettably, most of them were defective and didn't work at all. It would be a useful device were it not for the sloppy manufacturing."
4,Intermatic PR3C power failure light works well,"The Intermatic PR3C power failure light works fine. The "" Three-in-One"" description is a bit confusing, but when the power goes off, the light comes on, and it's bright enough for the purpose. When the unit is plugged in and the power is on, it gives off a yellowish light which is not bright enough to function as a night light , so I don't understand what that light is for. The unit only takes up one space in a receptacle, and also has a ""pass through"" feature , so you can plug any 2 prong plug into the front of the unit, and therefore not lose any net receptacle spaces.This is a much better unit than the AmerTac lights I also bought."
1,Does not work or works for few days,"Not good. I bought three. Two of them do not turn on when power goes out. It does not have a light sensor, stays on all the time."
2,2 out of 3 work,"I bought 3 of these for use around the house. Out of the package, only 2 of the 3 worked. The 3rd one is dead."
2,Intermatic PR3C Three-in-One,The light from this is so little that it perhaps is just suitable for providing lighting by a few step stairway if the power goes off. I would say that the item just borders on effective.
4,over a year ago i purchased these lights,"purchased for the yearly huricane seasson , for me, my mom, and brother. last year with the heavy season , our power went out alot , and this light workd like a champ. and helped my kids feel more secure."
3,If your power goes out a lot,"I've owned these for a few years and I just purchased another here on Amazon.Basically, these lights are plugged into an outlet and have a little neon pilot light that lights up. When the power goes out, the flashlight comes on. There is a switch on the bottom to control this behavior, so it can work completely manually.I find this is useful for lighting area that you need to walk in the dark at night with no power. It's also useful to use as a quick flashlight if you need one in a hurry.The light lasts perhaps 15-30 minutes at full brightness and it will gradually get dimmer. I can't say how long it takes to go down to something too dim to be useful. However, if you want a flashlight, this is not the best choice.The neon pilot light always stops working on these after a few years, and they're a little expensive for what you get. But this is the only low-cost emergency lighting choice. They're pretty much no-fuss."
1,power failure light fails,"After a night time power failure and my youngest daughter freaking out because she was upstairs and we were downstairs. I decided to purchase several of these lights for the house. One came and did not work right out of the packaging. The rest of them have stopped working in ""flashlight"" mode, they only work in ""night light"" mode, when plugged in. They are supposed to change to flashlights when power goes out, however that function has failed on all 4 after 1 week. And yes, I've tried the switch in all different positions and at night; no joy. Now, I have four new night lights - whoops, make that three, as that one doesn't work at all."
5,Great little light!,I had one of these before and it stopped working correctly so I had to buy another one just like it. I like the orange light that is the usual night light and the fact that when the electric goes off it is a bright white light.
2,"Functional, but lacks quality","I purchased several of these for use in a business office setting. They were within the budget I had available to me, and they seemed to fit the requirements for emergency lighting in our windowless, interior-walled restrooms. A few of them didn't work when they arrived, but a few simple adjustments on the battery and/or light bulb contacts remedied that. I also learned that the lens twists off (not snaps off) to provide access for replacing the bulb. The Ni-Cd batteries are replaceable at the end of their useful lifespan, but the Torx-bit (star-socket) screw heads require special or creative tooling to access them. The device comes stock with a #14 (-watt) bulb--a bit too dim for my intended use. A #41 (1-watt) bulb will fit in its place, but I've not yet tested one to see whether it has any adverse affect on the fixture itself."
4,Its what I was looking for,"The power alert seemed cost effective. The Night light is a little bright but is handy in some situations. When the power goes out the light comes on,just what I needed."
4,"Intermatic PR3C Three Way Power Alert, Flashlight and Night Light.","This product works as advertised...it comes on when the power goes off, makes a handy flashlight, and also makes a nice nightlight. So far so good."
1,complete waste of money,basically what you're buying is a night light. I've had this things plugged in for three days straight and there's no flashlight at all. I'm disappointed because that's what I bought it for. Complete junk. And I can't just throw them out due to the rechargeable batteries inside - will have to see how to dispose of them properly. What a ripoff!
2,Not enough emergency light,The light came on when the power went off at 3 AM but the emergency light did not last long enough even though the battery had four or five days to fully charge. This will do for now but I would not purchase any additional.
5,Great safety feature and easy to install,"We own a new condo in St. Maarten in the Caribbean and because we will be renting it, we felt that having a security feature for our guests was a must. It serves it's purpose and so we are pleased. We purchased 3 units. The nightlight feature keeps the hallway lit at night and if there were to be a power faiure, our guests would have some security in knowing they have some vision to get around until power is restored. Because it's removable, it serves as a flashlight as well. Great product to have handy in any household.[..]"
5,Learn to play and play to learn with this play on words!,"I loved this book based on a play of words. It also introduces some incredible works of art, masterpieces to children! I have many, many books on art and this is one of my favorites. Children love it, too"
5,Does the job,Installation was a snap. Used pliers to tighten timer on and off tabs as suggested and have no problems with them staying in place. This is a great product and works perfectly!
5,Well worth it,"Easilly installed, works well. I really believe it saves me money on my electric bill. I had one at my last house i had bought used, It never gave me any trouble. I expect as much from this one"
2,Too Loud,"I agree with the other review. I use it for a 220V air conditioner. While the AC is louder than the timer, the timer is running all the time, and especially annoying inside."
5,Cost Effective!,"Excellent, sturdy product for 220V HW heater. Easy to install. Silent operation. Already saving me money on the electric bill. We just switched to on-off peak electric billing, and this device makes a difference. Likely payback in less than a year."
1,Not Jumping,Installed unit in water heater closet. Unit works fine with manual control.Automatic control does not work. The timer motor runs but does not turn allthe gears due to defect or damage.I would be happy to send it back if I had something to install in it's place.
1,too noisy,"Although the product functions well, it better be used in a garage or other remote area. Mine is in the laundry room and the clock groaning can be heard in the adjoining bath as well as the laundry room. It was relatively quiet for 2 years then became noisy. in addition, unless you live in an area with extremely expensive electric rates the $56.00 cost plus installation might put your payback time in the distant future. Fortunately I installed my own but remember it is 220 volts we're talking about here. I have been told that the efficiency of current hot water heaters (better insulation etc.) makes the use of this clock to save money a dubious endeavor."
1,timer off,"does not keep correct time, so it does not turn off and on when I want it to. do not buy this item"
3,It's noisy,"I've installed them in previous houses for the hot water heater and now I've got to replace my current one after 19 years. They do save money (about $20 per month for my 50 gallon 220v water heater) but it operates by using mechanical gears and switches and consequently is very noisy. They are easy to program and reliable, but put some thought into where you mount it, due to the noise it makes."
2,WHO WANTS A COLD SHOWER.....,purchased appx 1 1/2 yrs ago. timer is still functioning properly and does not seem too loud where i have it located in my basement. I like the manual on/off switch on the outside of the case when you want to bypass the timer this works well.Im giving it 2 stars simply because ive had the time trippers loosen up and move 3 times now over a 1.5 yr period. 1st time was after i put it in so i figured it was my fault not making the trippers tight enough.Than it happened again of couse my wife was the one who took 2 cold showers and wanted to rip it off the wall after that. I read the instructions and tightened the trippers using a pliers and was ok for 10 months. Sure enough my last shower i noticed the hot water was dropping off quickly. I checked the timer and the on tipper had loosened up and slide off the correct time.I will try to loctite the trippers and see how this does.
4,"Good content, bad layout","A great collection of trivia! There are a lot of questions that are very tough even for a longtime diehard such as me, but still not ridiculously obscure. The jersy numbers section alone makes this book worth owning.The layout could have been better, though. The questions are in the first half of the book, the answers in the second. The question pages lack a reference to the page number of the answers so if you're just picking the book up to flip through it, it's difficult to look up the answer to a stumper."
1,Not for pets,I bought a second one as a gift for my mother's dog. But my Westie was peeling this within 5 minutes. I would not buy this again for a pet.
2,disappointing,"The ""Wham-O Superball"" was advertised as if it was the ball that has been around for a long time. I was purchasing it as a stocking stuffer for a very old BOY who remembered them from his childhood. He described how far they bounced, etc. What I received was a superball clearly made recently to specifications that were far less than the original ball. I know this because the BOY then went on eBay and found an ""original"" ball and purchased it, then demonstrated for me how different the bounce is on the old version vs. the new one. Disappointing as the person giving a gift!"
2,NOT INCREDIBLE,"This ball BARELY bounces hire than the 25 cent ones you find at Pizza Hut. Don't buy this ball, find the old school version."
1,Whammo power ball sucks,The whammo super ball I purchased was too small and broke into a million pieces upon the second time I bounced it. I wish I could seek somekind of damage for the frustration of that crappy product.
3,Smaller than I expected,"Just turned 50 and remember owning one as a kid. Bought this out of nostalgia. Truth be told, I was somewhat disappointed when it arrived. Smaller than the original and NOT made out of rubber. Some material called Zylon or something. Didn't they fight in Battlestar Galactica? That being said, the product did its job. It brought out the inner child in me as I enjoyed throwing it against the garage wall. For the price it can't be beat, although I wish they made it in the original size. Choking hazard or not. And in another color other than black."
1,JUNK,"I BOUGHT SEVERAL OF THESE...RUBBER WAS FULL OF IMPURITIES, BOUNCE WAS LESS THAN 40% ON ALL OF THEM. STARTED BREAKING APART ON SIMPLE DROPS. PURE JUNK, THRU THEM ALL OUT. DON'T BOTHER. ABSOLUTE CRAP!"
1,Item different than what pictured!,"The toy is fine. But buyer beware - the product is not what is pictured. This item is actually for the vehicle shapes, not regular shapes. I was so disappointed. Now I have to reorder this toy for what I thought I bought, snap-lock beads in 12 SHAPES, not vehicles."
1,Don't buy this DVD or VHS.,"This DVD could easily be rated R. The naughty bits that show on the screen are covered up by the film editors with a banner unlike a lot of other DVDs such as ""Nude Yoga"" and ""Nude Tai-Chi"". Wild and Crazy Bikini Babes volumes 1 and 2 are a complete waste of time."
2,An intensive word study,"While this was an assigned textbook, by the author himself, I feel no obligation to patronize him or other potential readers.Dr. Weatherly himself has said this book was hastily written - and frankly, if he had more time he might have more developed the theological and historical implications of the letter to the Thessalonians instead of focusing so heavily on the Greek words contained within the scripture.It is not a book for someone wanting a quick and practical tool to learn about these epistles - but for the scholar, it is a well researched commentary dissecting word by word and phrase by phrase what Paul intended.Buy it, because Dr. Weatherly deserves it. :)"
5,Judy Grahn is the best living American Poet.,"It is good to see Grahn's work is finally getting the general recognition it deserves. As a feminist poet of the 1970's, her work was much overlooked by the general literary community. That is finally changing. Wands and Swords are wonderful examples of her work, but I wish she would finish up the Tarot with Pentacles and Cups. But, her work is about struggle and strength, not money and sentimentality. So if there are only two ""queens,"" Wands and Swords will have to do.Don't miss her other poems. ""A Woman is Talking to Death"" should be in more anthologies. You have not read contemporary poetry if you have missed this example of her laureate level work."
3,Certainly not the best of Jane Heller!,"I was in love with Ms. Heller's books after first reading ""Sis Boom Bah"" and ""Cha Cha Cha"". I also loved ""The Club"" and ""Princess Charming"". I love her sense of humor and writing style. However, with ""Infernal Affairs"" she started going downhill and continues on that same slide with ""Crystal Clear"". IA was way out of the mainstream and CC is just too way out for me. Way more than I ever wanted to know about New Age."
2,A predictable romance,"This book was about as predictable as romances go. The professional business woman, Crystal, goes out to the dessert to think about her job, which is in crisis, her lame boyfriend, and to try to relieve herself from the stress which is caused by her lifestyle. While out there she goes on a jeep tour and the driver just happens to be her ex-husband. Then one of the passengers on the jeep disappears, so Crystal has to team up with her ex. They solve the mystery and fall back in love. Each page is more predictable than the rest, and I suggest not reading this book, because of that. Unless, of course, you like boring, predictable, romances."
4,Sedona's Best Travel Guide,"My two best friends and I all read Crystal Clear before our trip to Sedona. It was better than any travel guide I've every read. We ate at L'Auberge, took the jeep tour, had lunch in Jerome, and basically did everything that Crystal did, except solve a kidnapping. Although none of us would have minded being kidnapped and kept in Sedona for a little longer. A fun read."
1,Very disappointed,"I too ordered this Ten-Eighty Quarter Pipe manufactured by World Industries, Inc. for Christmas for my son. The weather here is dreadful and we didn't open the boxes until today for assembly and promptly recycled the box as we also cleaned out the garage (it was huge). We are just now realizing that like other customers that have purchased this item there are NO assembly instructions (at least 30 parts) and NONE of the required hardware or end covers was included. What is the deal with that?? After 45 minutes on the web site there does not appear to be a way to contact the vendor (the option to contact seller is apparently removed with time) and even if I had the box I am unable to return it. What a huge disappointment and waste of money."
1,10 - 80 1/4 Pipe,I ordered this product for my son for Christmas. We get it outside to put it together and first there are no instructions at all. So how hard can it be we get out the poles and then realize there are no parts nuts bolts locking caps nothing he was so diappointed we had to box it back up what an awfull way to begin an 11 year olds Christmas this was bad. You have to rate the item by stars I would have put none but it does not allow it.
4,factor X quarter Pipe,"Kids love this quarter pipe. However, did not ship in a timely fashion due to amazon delay in ordering and had NO directions. Luckily a friend had almost the same thing and we pretty much figured it out after a phone call to the company. It did take a while to assemble."
1,A waste of time and money,"I picked up this book about five months ago, and I have to say I was truly looking forward to a complex plot mixed with fly-fishing. Unfortunantely, the book contains neither a well written plot, or beautiful descriptions of days on the water. The Snowfly is not worth your time or money, unless you have a severe case of insomnia."
4,Health In A small Bottle,"I took all kinds of herb pills, gave up sugar ,gave up all Carbs, still my blood sugar was just above borderline of being Diabetes. After 4months taking this It showed decline in the number of fasting blood sugar and HgA1C.After 12 months, I surprised my doctor with Normal range of HgA1C and fasting blood glucose. It is very affordable price.Taking Gymnema is part of my daily routine now."
4,Probiotic for Women,I like this product. It actually works and pills are very small. I just take 2 a day and the bottle would last for 30 days. The price is reasonable and the quality is good. I just wished they had 120 or more capsules. I also use the regular probiotic from Sedna Lab and it works just like the other one.
5,It gives me energy and ambition,"This is the best probiotic I have ever used and I have tried some pretty expensive brands.I read the book ""mold worriors"" from amazon and even though the doctor did not mention this product I decided to try it.I believe I am in the 24% who cannot break down mold, fungus or yeast and this does for me what my body cannot do on it's own.It gives me energy, ambition and drive. I take about 4 or 5 a day. They only suggest 1 or two daily, every other week and maybe someday I will do that but right now I need more and later I will try to cut down. If I need them and they make me feel so good, I'm going to take them.It is a miracle pill for me.Thank you Sedona Labs"
4,Great ways to connect with God!,Awesome and insightful material and if you really want to learn more I found their website at [...] very informative.Any true christian will find a lot of revelation in this series and become closer to God. I cant wait to really apply some of these principles in my own life and see where God leads me ;)
3,not for many shrader valves,"Really hard to get metal T pieces in various sizes wrong so I just tell you that this is not worth a penny over a $100 and I wish I had paid less. It works just ok on most older vehicles but it does not have the proper threaded adaptors for schrader valve pressure test ports on many european vehicles made after 1993 and probably many US vehicles too. It would appear from the picture that with so many pieces in the kit that checking fuel pressure would not be a royal pain in the @%# but it is a nightmare of tiny adaptors, hoses put together in various combinations to suit different vehicles. What happens when one gets lost?"
2,no way,I have this fuel pressure test kit. it was purchased by the company not me. I just saw its list price and have to say that I would not want to pay $50 for this. The other review mentioned the nightmare of putting tiny bits together to fit different cars and its true and its also true that it doesn't fit many cars after the early 90's. It is also true that losing a piece or two makes the whole box worthless which is exactly what has happened. The problem here is trying to cover too many bases and the truth is that it would be better to buy a fuel pressure test kit that covers your needs only.
4,Excellent History Book of Nova Scotia,"If you want to read a very good book of Nova Scotia's history, this is an excellent book to start with. I find it is a easy read and the chapters are layed out well making it a breeze to follow. As an American citizen, good history books a hard to find in the states on Canadian History. Nova Scotia history is very interesting. Excellent READ."
4,A good book for introduction,"I have recently bought this book. I have been studying on evolution of the test particles in a particular planewave spacetimes, and I have realized that the system admits a non-integrable structure. I should investigate whether the particle motion emerges chaos or not. But, my knowledge on chaos was almost zero, before buying this book. Now, I am going to complete the full analysis of the book, and I am much more familiar to the concept of chaos. However, this book can be used for just begining. To proceed to the advanced problems you should look for other materials, especially to the articles about chaos. I advise this book as a first book to start chaos.Dr. Izzet Sakalli"
5,Colleen Donovan Skinny-Dipping scene,"This is a very sexy Video! I love every scene. Each and every single girl in this video is gorgeous! I can't think of anything I dislike about it. My favorite girl in this video is when Colleen Donovan from Boyertown, Pennsylvania. She's gorgeous! My favorite scene is when she goes skinny-dipping. I would love to be in the water with her. After a hard works day on the farm, she goes skinny-dipping. I'd have to say she's a lot like me, she works hard and loves to skinny-dip!! She's someone who'd I'd love to go skinny-dipping with. She is smoking hot!"
4,Fine tune your banking,"This book doesn't go over the many techniques used in banking systems, rather it takes that you know this and then tells you how you can more accurately antipate 'collision-induced-throw' and manipulate banks that wouldn't otherwise work (by using different cuts and english).The books take on an aiming system is well thought out, it takes some getting used to though, and requires an aiming system as a guide. I've used the aiming system, on canned shots, and can see the techniques and it works for me. I will still require many hours to master this book though."
2,Bad Auto Subwoofer Detection,"If your system was unable to detect your wireless subwoofer, follow this steps...1. Ensure all connections are completed.2. Turn on your wireless subwoofer.3. While pressing the SKIP BACKWARD from the main unit, press the number 3button your remote.4. While P is displayed press I/D SET. Turn off the wireless subwoofer,then turn it on again.Thanks to Panasonic Customer Support but I cannot recommend this Home Theater System to other people. This wireless system can cause radio frequency interference to other wireless appliances (phone, routers, laptop, etc.)"
1,James,Home theater arrived with a defective subwoofer.I had to return it to 6avenue the vendor that Amazon shipped it from.Horrible service-still waiting for the replacement subwoofer(3 weeks).6ave has told me 6 times they would ship in 24 hrs.I had to file a A-Z gaurentee claim with Amazon.(still in progress)Stay away from anything coming from 6ave.
4,Overall Good Purchase,"I selected this sytem based on the reviews, the wireless capabilities and the price. Since receiving it I am pretty happy with it. The sound is good and despite some of the other reviews it was pretty quick and easy to set up. There are a couple things I think everyone should know about this system before purchasing though. The wireless sytem is not really wireless. The rear speakers work off of a receiver that they are wired to. So basically you do not have a wire going from the main unit to the rear of the room but you will have wires going from the receiver unit to your speakers. Also, when this system is turned on it does indeed affect my wireless internet signal. In order to use my computer on the internet I have to turn this sytem off. All in all I think it's pretty good though."
4,Good for what it is,"Sounds good for a wireless home theater system, and an excellent value for the cost. Does not sound as good as our wired system which cost voer 4 times as much, but you get what you pay for. Fine for most of the time viewing. No problems expierenced, but DVD up conversion not as good as we hoped, true HD signal, such as HD cable, provides a better picture."
4,Great buy,We tripple love this home theatre. only complaint about it would be losing wireless connection to the laptop sometimes when it is on. I highly recomed it to everyone.
1,Sony Reader Daily Edition ClearTouch Anti-Glare Screen Protector (Single Pack),"Completely unusable thing. I put it over my PRS-900 and than drop out to the trash bin.Same and even worse glare, impossible to put this protector withoout bulbs. I bought original protector for Nook and doesn't have any of this issues.So I will never buy any thing from this prodcucer - don't spend your money on this junk too."
3,"does its job, nothing more and nothing less","i bought this screen protector for my Sony Reader Daily Edition and it does its job - i admit it could cut down glare even more and i hope the manufacturer will improve the protector in this aspect next time around. but the protector does protect the screen and i haven't had any problems with it. it takes a bit of patience to put the protector on without getting a bit of air bubbles, but not too bad - included is a plastic card and small microfiber wipe to help you apply the protector onto your Reader. the product works fine but a bit pricey, in my opinion."
1,Sony Reader Anti glare Screen,"This arrived in good shape but is totally useless. Couldn't fit it over the screen, it got damaged in trying and we ended up throwing it away."
5,Fantastic Heater!,"I bought this to stay warm at my daughters house on the Mainland as they don't heat to save $$. I have tried many space heaters and this is fantastic. Did not expect 400w to do such a great job heating a room and I didn't want to burden them with the 1500 watt price of electricity-- so I feel like I won the heater lottery. I love the instant heat, the ability to maintain a great room temp at 400watts, use the timer before I go to bed, use the remote if I want a blast of heat or turn it down/off from across the room or bed, carry it easily around, adjust it's height.... don't know if I believe the ionizing worth, but don't care... it's quiet too, and not a blinding or annoying light source... obviously, I can't say enough in it's favor... I use it in a small room that is open to other rooms in three directions and it works great."
1,Is it Worth it?,"My girl friend just brought this product 2 month a ago and works great.The only problem we had was its broken now, it take 2 month for this product to break. We only used this heater no more then 3 times a week. I think this product is over price and if you all thinking this would worth this much of money... I don't think so.Warranties was such a crop... They want you to pay all the shipping cost back and forward that would cost a lot of moneys."
4,excellent,"i didn't like the movie that much, but the soundtrack is awesome. definitely wait until the movie comes out on video to see it... but get this CD, its the best."
2,nena,"not great ,but o.k. i guess? she should have stuck to 99 luft ballones!and i understand german!"
4,Arnold caputures the key questions and answers them,Clinton Arnold has captured the essence of the issues surrounding spiritual warfare. He iw well versed in the issues relating to the topic and is well able to balance the variety of thoughts. He is taking an assertive yet measured approach to spiritual warfare and this book serves as a good primer on the topic.
4,An introduction to the focused ion beams (FIB) technique,"The Focused ion beam (FIB) technique has come to be considered particularly useful, both as a method for fabricating transmission electron microscopy (TEM) samples, and as a way of patterning surfaces. FIB is increasingly important in electronics research and development, from the sputter profiling of integrated circuits, to extracting cross-sections of devices for analysis by TEM. The authors lay the theoretical foundation for this technique, including the physics of ion optics and scattering, and the design of metal ion sources. This book also contains a number of figures illustrating the results of FIB fabrication."
3,Invacare Tub Safety Bar,"This product is sturdy and has an easy-to-grip upright handle. The handle could be a few inches taller, and it was not easy to unscrew the clamp to attach it to the tub. At first I thought I would not be able to fit the clamp over the tub, but I finally unscrewed it enough to fit. I think an elderly person would have trouble unscrewing it, fitting it over the tub rail, and tightening it. Now that it is in place, however, it is a good safety item. The person I bought it for has Parkinson's Disease and balance issues. The safety bar works well to help him climb in and out of the shower."
1,Poor binding,"I agree with the previous reviewer, this is a fairly thin treatment of the US for an atlas. I would have given it a higher rating than one star, though, except for the quality of the binding. The first time I opened it, the back cover tore loose from the body of the text, from top to bottom, even though the book had been shrink-wrapped. The Brits who published it might want to check the QC program of their Hong Kong printer. I got this at a bargain price (under $4) so I hesitate to complain further... but those of you thinking about giving over $30 from another seller might want to reconsider."
4,Twist One Complete Revolution,"The timer is very good; the instructions, bad. I thought mine had broken until I went out and bought another one and had the same problem with it, when it was time to change my clocks. Well, the instructions had faded off of the first one, but were clear on the second one. One of the things I realized while reading the instructions is that to reset the time, you must turn the ""setting"" one complete revolution. You can't just inch it forward or back to set the right time."
3,"Good timer, but buy a digital timer instead","This works fine. After a year or two, mine has developed a tiny grinding noise that is not noticeable except when the room is very quiet. It sounds like a diesel pickup truck is idling way up the block. It sounds like a pair of tiny flamenco artists, clapping away rythmically, somehow happy to be trapped inside my cheap plastic timer. I would recommend buying a digital timer instead."
2,I know you haven't made your mind up yet.,"This CD features actors and actresses singing lullabies. Most of the actors here actually sing pretty well. Unfortunately, the arrangements of the songs are pretty dull. The songs by Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Irons and Eric McCormack aren't bad, but the rest of them are pretty boring. But a lullaby is designed to make you fall asleep, and these dull songs may very well bore you to sleep, so mission accomplished."
4,Overall a great product,"I give this item 4 stars because the quality is great, but the sizing was off. I am not a large person by any means (5'6"" 135 lbs), but these ""one-size-fits-all"" leggings wrapped around my thighs in a most unattractive manner. I peeled away the non-slip lining from the inside of one of the leggings, and then it fit fine, and very attractively. I can see how thinner customers would greatly benefit from this, but if you're rounder around the edges, order similar leggings without the non-slip lining. Other than that, a great quality item."
2,one size fits all (toothpicks),"these are well made for the price but they are too tight in the thighs! i am by no means big (a size 6) but i have thicker thighs and these were way too tight on my thighs, i couldn't even get them up all the way! for one size fits most, they don't even fit an average size... disappointed that i wasted the money and that i couldn't even wear them for my man. don't buy if you dont have very slender legs."
1,did not stay up,"nice quality but did not stay up keeps sliding down kind of annoying, just sitting in my closet, consider that"
3,"TIght for 5'11""","not so good for a woman thats 5""11"" and 160 pounds. Seems like the quality is fine though. can still wear this but I squeeze out the top a bit. :("
2,Disappointing.,"Upon receiving the product, it was disappointing to learn that the actual stockings are not true to the picture, which is a flaw. There is nothing ""fishnet"" about them."
3,Sexy stockings,I found the fit on these to be nice and they seem to look sexy. They have only held up average but I still think they are worth the money.
4,A solid American made knife. A piece of living history.,"I love my Buck. It came razor sharp & holds an edge well. Although I have heard of some people receiving sub-standard 119's, mine was fine. Either way, I know the warranty on this knife would cover any serious defects. This knife should last for years as long as you maintain it properly. If anything, I do wish the handle could be improved as grip can be difficult when it is wet."
1,Not As Good As They Make It Sound,"This book is apparently for high school or below. There are drawing illustrations, but they are not helpful. Information is basic, at best. One area states that a woolen dress was preferred by natives as well as mixed breeds in the 1820's. They show the typical Regency style dress and make it sound like it was native only. Only basic information, of which anyone can find out when attending one reenactment, or by doing basic research on the web. Very disappointed because of the hype on how authoritative this book is. Don't waste your money. The book has a really bad drawing of the Indian mother in a Benjamen West painting. I suggest that anyone interested, look directly to the painting for better information. I would have never purchased it, had I known before hand."
5,OMG this is really good stuffs!,"Sugarcult is awesome! And I just want to say that Avril sucks soo much. I don't get why people like her. Anyway, this album is really really good and you should get it. My favorite song has to be ""Stuck in America"" it's a great song. Amazing album!!!!!"
2,Ok but not great,"I bought this CD after hearing two of the songs on this CD ""Bouncing of the Walls"" and ""Stuck in America"". I really like both of them so I figured this would be a good CD. It's not a bad CD but I found most of the songs to sound sort of the same. They were all ok but pretty mediocre."
3,"Shaken, but not stirred","In the tradition of great bands, like Warrant and Fleetwood Mac, Sugarcult has this special glow about them-- you just know they'll turn into something big. Unfortunately, that glow doesn't come across on this album. I've been a Sugarcult fan for years, and I really felt let down by this album. Since when did Rob Thomas start writing their songs for them? And, hot tip for the singer, it stops getting interesting when EVERY SONG is about your ex-girlfriend. Do more lesbian stuff. Survey says: better than American Hi-Fi and white bread."
3,"Good, Solid Pop-punk","Sugarcult is not profound, but they sure know how to write catchy hooks and scream-along choruses. If that's all you're looking for, this is truly a great CD. If the listener is willing to surrender to the fun vibe and not worry about pretension, this purchase is money well spent.The band is at its best, though, when it steps ever so slightly out of the tried and true conventions of pop-punk. Not to say that ""Stuck in America"" and ""Bouncing Off The Walls"" are not infectious tracks, but the all-out assault of ""You're The One,"" the slightly reggae-inflected ""Pretty Girl,"" and the quiet, but (thankfully) not emo ""I Changed My Name"" expose a more interesting side of the band, just as the early independent track ""Debbie"" did.These songs plant seeds of hope that these boys might grow more comfortable testing new ground in the future, though seeing as their career is built on pleasing the teenage crowd, it's not entirely likely."
5,A punk group that actually know what they're doing,"I first saw Sugarcult on MTV2 with their video for 'Stuck in America' . I was instantly impressed by the fact that not only were the lyrics good, these guys seemed to actually know how to play their instruments, which isn't a common thing in the punk pop scene lately. A few month later, while looking for new music I decided to buy their cd.The first thing about them is that the intros to their songs are ""great, especially on ""Bouncing off the Walls"" and ""Pretty Girl"". ""Pretty Girl"" is probably the best song on the cd, not that the rest are lacking. There's a quality to this that is lacking in most music of the same sort."
3,Heard this before,"About this release I have to say: Just listen to the clips and you'll know if you dig this album and its sound. Yes, it's that approachable and unfortunately shallow and at times generic. Not complex, and not bad, but it has that 'you just heard the same song earlier in the day' feeling that makes the release a disappointment. The guitars are at times just lifeless, and if that element alone were improved this release would leap forward to compete with All American Rejects, Ataris, Motion City Soundtrack and others leading in this genre. Do check out the release that came after this one (sophomore release I believe), as it is filled with more interesting guitar work and songwriting that speaks to great potential for this band. If you just want some tasty post-punk junk food, this release will also satisfy."
4,..Rock..Emo..Pop..,"I looked everywhere for this CD. Over the course of 2 years I had finally found it at a Bust Buy. There was one left. I didn't really stop to think about buying it, so I just grabbed it. I put it in my CD Player and was amazed to here such good music by this band... this band i thought was just going to be another hunk of scum on the CD market. Actually, the suprise came to be that it wasn't at all. Sugarcult's Start Static has a cool kind of thing in their music.. i really dont know what there is.. but i find it similar to American Hi-Fi ( Comparing BOUNCING OFF THE WALLS to FLAVOR OF THE WEAK ) ... Anyways, majority of the songs on this CD are ' superb ' and worth buying for just the few that really stand out."
5,Wow,"This is actually the best cd I have ever listened to. Usually I like only a few songs on a cd, but I actually love every single song here. I'd classify the whole cd as pop-punk, but each song has an underlying musical element. Their earlier release of Wrap Me Up in Plastic, is also fabulous."
3,Sugarcult (probably the best pop-punk out in the mainstream),"Sugarcult arent really a revolutionary band but none the less are alot better than most mainstream pop-punk you hear such as good charlotte, new found glory etc.. With Sugarcult you get experimental elements in alot of the songs which is alot better than the usuall every song sounding the same type album which you tend to get alot of. The lead vocalist is a good singer which combines well with the melodic catchy music that they play and while you will get alot of people claiming that Sugarcult have sold out it seems clear to me that they havent due to the effort they put into touring and the band etc..It's refreshing to see this in the mainstream and is an improvment on some of the material you could find before start static so if poppy punk is your kinda music then without doubt this is one of the albums to pick up."
3,Cliche Is The First Word That Comes To Mind,"I love most of the songs on this album (Pretty Girl being my favourite along with Stuck In America, Bouncing Off The Walls, and Hate Every Beautiful Day). The lyrics are pretty good, but I've heard them all before in one form or another. I've fallen in love with Tim Pagnotta's voice, so that helps this album. The music is fun to listen to especially when you're feeling down I suppose. But the lyrics are the same as everyone else's lyrics and that makes me a little angry. Fortunately, the songs are perfect for some of the stories I write...definitely inspires some stories as I listen to it.But, I still like this album and I recommend it if you have some extra cash and want to spend it on something."
1,No thanks,"I like pop-punk, but this is just to extreme to the pop side. This is as poppy punk rock as you can find (even more so than GC and SP)in fact i dont think you can associate any part of punk with these guys. I was sick of it after 2 listens, its so irritating. I don't know what to say except this is not for someone looking for a good rock album. Try: Yellowcard, Rufio, Taking Back Sunday, Starting Line, Dashboard Confessional."
1,be aware that this is not punk,"It is bands like this and Distillers that make punk out to be a bad genre. Which it is anymore anyway. All these are are cheesy love songs and what isn't is usually a Green Day rip off. ""Stuck In America"" is particularly horrible as is that new single they have out. This could classify as Green Day wanna-be (not to mention punk wanna-be) pop. Needless to say, it is completely unoriginal as well. Well, that's all I have to say. Bands like this keep it up and destroy your little scene."
1,This is a perfect example of what is wrong with todays music,"I can't say enough about this mindless junk. All the tracks have the same subliminal message: ""Let's be stupid simply because we're young, and that will make us cool."" If you want fun and energetic music with catchyness, listen to some older Santana songs. (Black Magic Woman comes to mind)"
4,Local Bands Rule Again,"Since sugarcult is from my town I must give my props to how much I love this album. Some good rockin songs, and a few ballads, a nice balance. The vocals are good, the music is well put together and original. You cant loose with this cd"
3,a soso attempt,"this CD is okay. Most songs are bland, sounding quite the same. The one I enjoy the most is Hate every beautiful day. But the other songs just don't have much to them. If you want better music, try the band yellowcard. If you want better lyrics, as theirs are shallow, try Dashboard confessional."
3,Ok I guess,"I bought this cd after listening to the clips and their songs that they play on the radio, and judging from them, I expected something a little more punk than this. Maybe more ""Green Day"" and less ""Lifehouse"". Nonetheless, its not a horrible cd, and there are some really awesome songs (mainly #1-#6). Their style has some unique elements, but overall the formula is the same. Bottom line: worth listening to, but not worth the [$$]."
3,Ok....,Yeah I thought this CD was pretty cool and all but it sounded sort of... copied... And I feel sort of.... alone... Am I the only one who likes the hidden track? I thought it was tite. O well.... Theyre old stuff is a million times better
2,Nothing New to this Listener,"Having a strong affection for all that is great in the world of Mod, Post-Mod and Punk, I expected much more from this cd. Instead of hearing a band who might pay some homage to the Jam, Clash or Stiff Little Fingers, I've been left with a band which sounds no different than hundreds following in the wake of Lit or Green Day success. Too bad those A&R folks care so much about finding clone bands without considering a band's song-writing abilities."
4,"Not the best, but good.","I saw Sugarcult live awhile ago when they opened for Good Charlotte. I really enjoyed their performance, they had great energy. I bought their album, and I was satisfied with it. Although there are a couple of songs that aren't so great, overall, it's a good album if you like pop-punk bands like green day, blink 182, sum 41, good charlotte, or mest."
5,The BEST band EVER!!!,"Ok, usually i am into r&b and rap and stuff...Sugarcult is great! I think everyone should hear them at least once! This is one of the only cds where i can just put it in and play it all the way through without having to skip songs. It is seriously the best cd and i recommend it to everyone no matter what music you listen to. I hope that they make another cd."
4,Star Static,"This is a great cd,I really liked it.Would recomend to any one who is a fan of other bands such as New Found Glory,Simple Plan,Sum 41 and Good Charlotte,to get this cd.SugarCult has a very good sound.Enjoy."
5,Easily a five-star!,"Vivaldi steals the show as usual but Fischer brings down the house with her performance. If this disc was Bluray, it would get an extra star."
4,Quatro estaes,Ótima apresentao além de uma constatnte modificao do cenário lembrando a aparencia das estaòes que tanto se diferenciam tanto na natureza com música. Parabéns Julia.
2,What do you want?,"I have many different versions of ""the four seasons"" but after hearing on TV Il Giardino Armonico play it. I just had to buy the CD. So I had high expectations and was expecting to see the orchestra all the time. Enjoying the beautiful music and divine performance. But most of the time I just see Venice. That information was not clear when I bought the DVD. If you like to look at a tourist DVD about an overrated Italian city while listening to divine music, then this is maybe your choice. But if you expect to see a great orchestra perform the best classical piece of music, then you will be disappointed."
5,should have been a double disc,"This is an essential recording, period. However, I wish RCA had taken it to the next level and expanded it to a double disc. Some of the arias were curtailed in the original CD release, in order to make it fit on one disc. Additionally, a few arias could have been added, to round out two discs. Morro, Ma Prima in Grazia, for example. They could have even taken from the duet recital with Placido Domingo.Still, what you have here is miraculous singing. I don't think Verdian singing would have been fully comprehended without the contribution of Leontyne Price."
5,This is the one you're looking for....,"Those of us who grew up in the late 70s will remember these Oscar Wilde specials that used to air on Sunday afternoons.Often these would be aired around Christmas time although none of them are a deliberate ""Christmas"" story; ratherstories which move and have a strong moral thread.These movies will not be forgotten...not even after one viewing. Exercise caution, however, when deciding to show these movies to very youngchildren since they are all quite profound and sad in nature. I remember back in the 70s when many a sensitive child had bad dreamsafter watching ""The Happy Prince"" that many a network took it off the air...never to be seen again...Finding these again is a goldmine and well worth the money."
3,tv show full season,"This was a gift for my daughter. It's not my style, but she really liked it. She doesn't think vampires should ""sparkle""."
4,Love ShyFy from Canada,"I love the shows from Canada made in the '80's,and this is a good one. The lead actress was made for this genre and never disappoints. She strong and believable."
3,Sastisfied,"This purchse came new and on time no damage to disk, no scratches or anything and it plays well. It was packaged as should be and therefor I'am happy with this purchase."
5,Something for Everyone!,"I love this series! Its a great combination of history, fantasy, and drama that brings to life an otherwise forgotten character in history. A modern day vampire solving supernatural crimes with a retired cop turned private investigator is a plot that should entertain everyone. There's drama, romance, sexual tension, and fantasy all wrapped up in a nice two season series.The series' focus is on Henry Fitzroy, the illegitimate son of Henry VIII, and a private eye in modern day Toronto. The series suggests that Henry Fitzroy did not die of consumption as history believes but instead became a vampire."
2,Great Series but...,"Why did they split up the DVD into two seasons? I know that's how Lifetime aired it, but it was filmed as one season. The UK version released it all together. You can currently buy the complete 22 episode Region 2 DVD set from Amazon UK for just over $10 including shipping! Thanks to my Region Free DVD player, I did just that."
4,Great whether you have read the book series or not!,"My husband had not read the book series and he loved this show. We never missed an episode - and we were so upset that it got cancelled. One of my coworkers gave me these books to read. She had watched the series first then grabbed the books. If you haven't read the book series (The Blood Books by Tanya HuffThe Blood Books, Vol. 1 (Blood Price / Blood Trail),The Blood Books, Vol. 2 (Blood Lines / Blood Pact)&The Blood Books, Vol. 3 (Blood Debt / Blood Bank)) get them today. If you haven't watched this series - you should check it out - you will not be disappointed."
3,"Good Show, low resolution DVD","We had missed season one when it was on US TV so I was anxious to get this season set. Unfortunately I'm disappointed with the quality of the DVD. On TV (at least from my provider) the show was letterboxed for a 4:3 TV. I was expecting the DVD to be widescreen 16:9, but unfortunately they created a DVD product that was that same letterboxed 4:3 screen.I don't understand why they did such a crappy digital transfer. I wasn't expecting blu-ray but I was expecting a widescreen DVD. Obviously it's probably stated on the Amazon listing but I didn't notice it.I'll keep the set as it's a great show, but I won't be buying season 2."
2,not as advertised,"I love the series. nuff said. however, the dvd leaves much to be desired. the product description says 'closed captions'. the box says 'closed captions'. however, there are NO captions. I have returned the first dvd set and have received the replacement set. still NO closed captions. NONE, NADA, ZILCH, ZERO. the SERIES is still a delight. but the PRODUCT itself really is a disappointment. this DVD set belongs in the hall of dvd shame."
3,disappointment,Having never seen a episode of Blood Ties but reading the reviews I ordered seasons one and two. The acting was wooden. Nothing flowed as it should and for some reason the characters seemed to be reading from scripts just out of sight. The theme of the show sounded good but the reality was just too poor. After watching 3 episodes I shot the season 1 into the circular file and cancelled my order for season 2. This show may make it for you but I was just bored.
2,Wake me up when its over!,I have been watching thr True Blood series which I thoroughly enjoy. I purchased Blood Ties thinking it would be good with such outstanding reviews. OMG.. I have yet to stay awake for one whole episode. I am not sure if I will even try to watch the rest. All I can say is B O R I N G !!!! Season 2 forget it!
2,Get Smart (1995) - not so smart...,A disappointment...not enough of Max and 99 in the series - their son (Andy Dick) does not have the presence nor timing that Max had in the secret agent role - the same one liners while well delivered did not have the same impact for me. Elaine Hendrix (Agent 66) looked bored for most of the time...a situation where they should have quit while they were ahead.
4,Watchable.,"I initially read some reviews on this show,and the impression i got it was pathetic.But i actually enjoyed it,but it obviously didn't have the laughs the original series had.Now some people have knocked the cast,and it was always at its best when Max and 99 were in it,although Zack and agent 66 were in it for the most of it.Bernie Kopell as Sigfreid made an appearance in one episode.I do think they could have found a better character than Andy Dick as Zack,while some parts he was ok,overall i think it was a mistake.When it ended i couldn't help but ask why the show had to end like that.I mean they go through so much trouble to assemble the show again,only to run 7 episodes.That was the disappointing thing.Wasn't so bad after all."
1,Deceptiive labeling,"We'd just seen the movie, and my wife brought me this in a bookstore assuming it was the original series. I knew it wasn't, but the front of the DVD claims ""The Complete Series"" with the title ""Get Smart"" with *no* indication that it is the remake other than the fine print ""the Smarts are Back in Control"". This is somewhere between dishonest and deceptive, and is certainly sleazy. Buyer beware: the real complete series is ~$200 for a boxed set of multiple seasons. Shame on Sony marketing."
1,Terrible,"I was initially very disappointed that the show on this DVD was not actually the original Get Smart. I still gave it a shot though. It may be that I was already looking at the show negatively based on my initial reaction, but the show is really not very good. It is hard to give specifics, the show is really just bland. Owing to the fact that there were only six episodes made.On the slightly positive side Don Adams is still very funny. It is also nice to see Barbara Feldon as Agent 99 again. In my opinion the buck stops with a little bit of nostalgia."
2,Thought it was the original series!,I didn't even know there was a sequel series where Don Adams had a son following in his footprints. Surprise; that's what this DVD is.
1,not as advertised,this is advertised as the complete series. this is not the original series from the 1960's but a remake of the series which was produced decades later. i was very disappointed as this is not what i expected.
1,bad marketing,"Get Smart video was not original series, as I'd expected. Totally disapointed and a waste of money."
3,Not The Original Series,"I saw this in the DVD section at Wal-Mart awhile back..Common sense tells you that you arent getting the original series for under $20.00, though they could have put ""1995"" on the label..Max and 99 look considerably older on the package..Just recently saw some of the series on YouTube..I think Andy Dick was miscast as Zack, though it was good to see Don Adams and Barbara Feldon again..It could have been a little better than it was.."
2,Not The Original Series,This is the Fox version and not the original NBC/CBS version. Not as funny. Spend the money and get the original series. It's much better.
1,Nothing like the original series,I used to love the original series. This was a huge dissapointment. The chemistry between Smart and Agent 99 is nowhere to be seen. She looks old and lost her charming innocence. The new characters are not funny at all.
4,Get Smart review,"I like the original Get Smart tv series, this series is not bad. Sad to say that some of the people from the original series are gone now. It is hard to bring back an old tv show and try to capture the same feel, most times it just doesn't work. I do like the 90's version of Get Smart anyway.Chris."
1,"Don't buy this...buy the ""original"" series",I bought this when I couldn't get any of the original Get Smart series unless I bought the all of them. This is awful and not funny. They try to dress-up the old shows with modern sex and slang and it just doesn't work.I really wish they would release all the originals on individual DVDs so I don't have to buy the whole set (it's too expensive for my budget).
5,"Am getting Smart, I think","Classic Get Smart, with the Control vs. Choas choas. Great laughs, classic scenes, and twisted plot and dialogue all make it the best!"
4,MUY BUENA!!,"La producción me hizo recordar buenos momentos que pase divirtiéndome con la serie original, y aunque no es igual ya que los artistas ahora son mas viejos, la gracia se mantiene y los nuevos entrantes actores le dan una semblanza diferente y buena a los capitulos. Me parece una buena compra nostálgica y a la vez de un paso hacia el frente."
4,The Best of Three,"I decided it was time to invest in reachers for the rooms in my home that I use most, so I oredered three more from [...]: the Invacare Multi-Pik Reacher, the PikStik Pro Aluminum Reacher, and the Medline 31"" Reacher. I put them all through several tests of common uses I have for reachers: pulling books down from shelves, picking up bits of paper and coins, and unloading the dishwasher. The results? I found the Invacare to be the most useful for me by far. The Medline seems to require more muscle power to grasp things, so it comes in a close second. The PikStik feels flimsy and I had a hard time grasping things. It has been consigned to the pantry where things are organized so that I do a minimum of reaching."
1,inferior reacher,"This is the worst reacher I have ever purchased and I have owned more than 10 in the last 9 years. The pads don't meet when closed, making it impossible to pick up small objects. It is flimsy and unsturdy. It is also the most expensuve ibe I have ever bought. I thought I was buying a quality product that would last. i AM AN AMPUTEE AND DON'T LIVE NEAR A SHIPPING SITE OR I WOULD HAVE RETURNED IT. SO I AM STUCK AN OUT OF $29. DON'T ANYONE BUY THIS REACHER. IT'S NO GOOD!"
3,"Good, but . . . .","It works great, and is light and grabs firmly, but one of the litle rubber pads fell off the gripper and got lost."
2,Not worth the money,The rubber tips came off within a few weeks and the entire gripper end broke off after about 3 months.
2,Poorly Made - broke during first month,"I liked this reacher, but it broke apart the first month of use. I really wish it had better durability because I like the larger grabbing paddles. I have one I got from the hospital that has a magnetic tip, so I won't be replacing this one."
2,to pick up,disappointing product - does not pick up as advertised. It is well made but too heavy for a senior - which I am. Was also expensive for something that is supposed to pick up items.
5,Egg poacher,Eggpoacher I did not think I odered that item and I was suprised when I got the notification that it was on the way. It shold have a grip ointhe middle. ii purchres one similar and it does have a handle. Well i shall have to stick some one with this aborition. Theothewr items are very useful
1,Not very sturdy!,"I have purchased three of these reachers. The first one was a favorite: just the right length and seemed sturdy, so I purchased two more. Now two of the three have broken. There's some little piece of plastic or metal inside that rattles around in the broken ones, but I can't seem to get them apart to figure out what's gone wrong. So it may or may not be fixable.I wrote to the merchant I bought them from, but it had been over 30 days since the purchase, so they suggested I contact the manufacturer. I did, and they have no warranty or help whatever. These reachers are relatively expensive, and 3-4 months use from this product is just not acceptable. Invacare actually offered to give me the names of local dealers who could sell me a replacement. Not likely, since I won't be purchasing any more of their products!"
1,Terrible - Very frail,Don't buy this product. It is very frail. We made homeade lasagna pasta and it can't hold it. It is a very frail and probably only good for very thin pasta. NOT RECOMMENDED.
2,Adequate drying rack but flimsy (very flimsy),"This product fits together and you can dry your fresh pasta with it. But it is flimsy when correctly assembled. Have been thinking of using wood glue on it but that would defeat its disassembly. So, what's a guy to do?I have been kind of regretting this purchase, mainly because why the devil would I wish to dry my pasta instead of cooking right away?So, the unit works, is pretty flimsy, and I was probably foolish to buy it (or ANY other drying rack) in the first place."
5,Worth the Wait,I had to wait a while for these to become available. Terrific product. Well worth the wait.
2,Pencil grips,I use these handgrips at work. I love the feel of them but they are pretty pricey for the amount you receive and they are not very durable. I bought them last month and two of them are already worn down and will need to be thrown away soon.
3,Only For Die-Hard Wu-Tang Fans!!!,Coming off of No Said Date i'd call this album a giant step backwards. This coming from a man who considers himself to be the #1 Wu-Tang fan. Of course the lyrics are on point from every member of the clan. Even the kids get in on the rhyming and deliver pretty good lyrics for their young age. But it's largely production that holds this one back from being labeled classic like it's predecessor. From tracks 1 to 13 the lyrics are poignant and flawless. But from tracks 1 to 13 the production is botched and flawed. This just goes to show that Wu members can always work with other producers but their most classic albums are largely produced by RZA. This is by no means a weak album with weak rapping. But it is hindered by it's production.
1,Hardly Tolerable,I would've gave it 0 stars but his kid ripped it in the intro. Wow what can I say... How do you go from a dark TRUE Wu Tang MC and make a wack song like Lovely Lady??? This dude fell off a long time ago. The LP is only worth copin to hear the sick production from Pete Rock (Track 8) & Metal Fingers (Track 2) and/or Rae & Ghost drop some ill verses. Wu tang Fans beware!!!
1,Classic????,"Come on can you honestly think this is a wu classic? just compare it to Liquid Swords, Only Built For Cuban Linx, Tical, and Iron man. if you can say this is up with those releases you are on crack!!!! For the cd, i just couldn't get into it. ya, he got some good production but he just couldn't hold it down. personally i think masta killa needs to have other wu members around him so he can shine on the track, but by himself it just makes me shake my head. A big let down as well as no said date. Not recommended at all"
2,What I Expected The First Time (2 and a Half stars),"Masta Killa shocked me with No Said Date. That album was my favorite Wu album since at least Supreme Clientelle, which was suprising because I always kind of ignored MK when listening to the Wu. This new album is what I expected from him the first time out. I did like a few songs Iron God Chamber, Pass The Bone, and Its What It Is, but the rest were kinda skip material to me. A little too much singing and skits, not enough of that straight up hip hop that we got on No Said Date. Just my personal opinion."
1,"C'mon, made where? Brooklyn deserves better rappers.","First and foremost, I have the previous album ""No Said Date"" and liked it. I can't say Masta Killa is able to touch the majority of Wu or associated cliks lyrically. He is mediocre in that department and not at all versitile. What his previous album had was probably years of accumilated material to choose from. This time around ""Made in Brooklyn"" is in my opinion garbage. Rae, Rza, Meth and Gza had great verses and Bronze Nazarath had great production which should have been used for the entire album. Masta Killa should have been the featured artist on this album because his presence is weak. When it comes down to it I traded this album and Pharell's 'In My Mind' in, getting about $3.50 each the day after original purchase and bought Bronze Nazareth's ""The Great Migration"" in their place. Oh well, the pain of being a hip-hop fan."
4,Some Serious Fun From An Old Mother!,"This CD compilation should be of interest to fans of Frank Zappa's tighter sounding ensembles dating from the 1973-74 period and beyond. There are a number of Zappa-esque instrumental numbers, a Weather Report inspired tune, some keyboard/electronica explorations, and a funny vocal tune about Zappa rumors and fanzine assumptions concerning Frank's lifestyle and personality.The music spans several decades from the late 60s through the 1990s. I've listened to this disc about ten times, and so far I'm enjoying it quite a bit. There isn't much here for those looking for music similar to the original Mothers band, but if you're a fan of 70s and 80s Zappa, and keyboard oriented jazz/rock, you might want to give this cd a listen."
4,Good Texas movie,"This is a good Texas movie. My dad was a Land Man (secures the leases to drill) so I grew up in this milieu. Two guys really can bring in a well if the pay is not too deep. All of the high school guys in oil country worked as roustabouts (general labor) or rig hands during the summers. When two guys get together, we discuss who missed what block or who jumped offside before we talk about women. Some of the minor characters in the movie have the names of real oil men and women. Good stuff."
4,Fun little romantic romp,"I saw this movie years ago. When I ran across it on-line I bought it to see if it was really as good as I'd remembered. It is. Screenplay may be a little ""hokey"" but the story is fun."
3,Waltz Across Texas,"I have seen this film and enjoyed it many years ago. With my failing memory, I thought Ed Harris played the lead role and I wanted to see some of his earlier works again. Unfortunately, Ed Harris was not the leading man but real life Anne Archers husband. I purchased it anyway, and it was not as good as I remembered, the age of the film is showing and it has the low budget look. The chemistry is there with Archer and her husband and the towel scene is still classic. Mary Kay Place was a delight to see as supporting actress. I just loved her accent in this film even if it was a bit over the top. I own it now, so I may look at again when nostolgia occurs to see Anne Archer or MKP. Last film I saw with Anne was her film with Tommy Lee Jones in ""Man of the House"". If your looking for an old TEXAS romance film, this just might fill the bill."
2,ONLY A FEW GOOD SONGS,I ONLY LIKED A FEW SONGS ON THIS THE OYTHR LIKE THE BACKSTRREET BOYS JUST TAKE UP ROOM. AAEARO CARTER IS THE BEST ON HERE.
5,THE TEN INCH MEGA MAN ROCKS!,this is the ultimate ultramega MEGA MAN Toy EVER!If you are gonna get your child a MEGA MAN toy get this one!this one is awesome!it's big and sturdy and has a little weapon that actually shoots a projectile at least a foot or two ;)It's a great toy.. I'm 28 and I own this!
3,Project Selection,"I thought this was a well written book. The models were explained simply, and with a logical progression. I got several ideas for a project I am working on - the original point of purchasing this book. I'd recommend it for anyone not experienced in this field."
4,Good introduction with useful pointers,"Models and Methods for Project Selection presents techniques to select projects according to multi-objective criteria (say return and risk) in deterministic and stochastic environments.The books is well-written. The chapters are concise and build on top of one another. The book makes use of concepts from different fields. It introduces the concepts and explains the relationship between them clearly.I'd like to point out that this is a theoretical book. Although algorithms and applications are presented, the book is of little direct use to project managers. It is targeted at researchers in the project management field. Also, the book assumes a certain familiarity with concepts from finance (e.g., net present value), utility theory and mathematical programming (e.g., simplex).One strength of the book is the many references. I knew many of those but I still learned about new (to me) ones.I recommend reading this book."
2,USAAF Mosquito operations,Aviation researchers are forwarned to check official USAAF documents and records to verify information before quoting anything from the chapter describing the USAAF Mosquito operations.
2,"Roomy and lightweight, but not durable","The Jolly Pet Tack Trunk is large enough for most supplies, although I certainly wouldn't try to cram a saddle into it. It does an adequate job of keeping supplies clean and organized, but the lid does not fit tightly enough to keep out dust and insects. The trunk is lightweight and sturdy enough to sit on, but the plastic piece of the lid which holds a padlock is brittle and breaks easily. This piece is part of the molded lid, and fits through a metal plate on the lower portion of the trunk. It can not be repaired, and there is no other way to attach a lock. This trunk could be improved greatly by using more durable materials where the lock is attached."
1,False advertising,This trunk is pictured incorrectly. It does not come with a tray with a wooden handle. The picture and description are both wrong. Amazon was no help with this problem.
4,Particle Editor Experiences,"I have had the Editor for over 6 months now and use it regularly. It uses over 70 events which can be customized and saved for future usage. There are many things that can be changed such as direction, coming toward you, away from you, speed, the number of items, colors used and so forth. All are 3D color graphics and the variety of them is large. The levels range from 0.0 to 1.0 for the SCL readings which can go lower or higher depending upon how tense or relaxed one is. There is an i for information for each graphic which is drop down and gives the essentials. It is sophisticated but easy to use. When I send an email for help regarding the usage it is answered quickly. I sent one question in on a Saturday and it was answered on a Sunday. The program starts up fast and has 6 different readouts that cover the 6 items that can be tracked. A user can track from 1 to 6 items as desired. Everything works as described and it is a unique experience."
1,"deceptive packaging, questionable Clapton content.","I was given this 3CD set as a gift and at first was very jazzed but that quickly faded. For the listener who might not know much about Eric's early years would have assumed that Eric is on all of the tracks in the 3CD set, but this is not TRUE ! Yes there are some great track in this set, the Sonny Boy Williams live tracks, but I also feel that someone has dubbed in keyboards and maybe a drum machine on some tracks. If you want to discover Eric's recordings with the Yardbirds to Cream then look up releases under those bands. And remeber that Eric's time with the Yardbirds was very short. Most releases of the Yardbirds have Jeff Beck and/or Jimmy Page on guitar. And if you want to really learn about Eric's recording history check out a book by Marc Roberty, The Complete Guide to the Music of Eric Clapton, ISBN: 0711943052. Hey you might like what you hear on this but for the hardcore Clapton fan you can find much better options...."
5,awesome!!,AWESOME MOVIE!!!I am expecting this to happen one day!!eg an asteroid or comet!!I hope I am not around when it happens and if it does MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A CHANGE IN CLEAN UNDERWEAR BECAUSE YOUR GOING TO NEED THEM!!!!
3,Classic George Pal from the early 1950s,"This movie (based on a novel written in the 1930s) was made around the time I was born. It reflects the curious combination of apocalyptic and utopian feelings about science that permeated the world of my childhood. It is a gorgeously colorful rendition of the end of ""old"" Earth and the search for a new one. Of course George Pal's special effects are not up to today's standards, but neither are they jarring enough to detract from my enjoyment of his work."
4,One of my favorite 50s sci fi movies,"A great film that aired on Family Classics on WGN and yes even the 330 Movie on WLS in Chicago.I'd love to see a remake of this movie, the script is awesome."
4,George Pal does it again,"I purchased this film along with Forbidden Planet and This Island Earth. Forbidden Planet was given the special treatment as a 50th anniversary edition and even though the other two were not they still look good. The version of this film I got has the earth and a larger red planet crashing together with the rocket as shown in the film escaping the crash. I enjoy these older films because they make me feel good inside. They take us back to a simpler time in history when things ""seemed more sane"". Maybe its my age? Anyway if you are a film fan and like science fiction you will enjoy this. The special effects look dated but thats part of the fun. Try to put yourself back in 1953, turn the lights down, get your favorite snacks and drinks etc. and escape from the morbid reality that is our current day world."
5,Great Classic Movie At A Fantastic Price!,"""When Worlds Collide"" is one of my very favorite Sci-Fi movies. It is based on a book by the same name, co-written by Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer (which is a great book with and enjoyable sequel, ""After Worlds Collide""). The movie is appropriate for all but the youngest viewers and rates highly on my family's ""Lazy Saturday"" movie list. The plot is fast moving, the acting is good, and the ""classic"" special effects are enjoyable (matte-paintings :-)This is a bargain priced DVD for a fantastic movie! Highly recommended!CFH"
5,A great Sci Fi classic,"When the end of the world is revealed mankind makes plans to carry on on a new world, but not all can go and those left behind decide that they should go instead."
4,Worlds Collided Way Before Deep Impact and Armageddon,"Deep Impact and Armageddon wowwed the masses with eye-popping special effects...In fact, they both make When Worlds Collide look cheap...But this movie, based on the famous novel, has to be the grandfather of the cosmic-impact genre...The danger, every bit as real as more modern movies, is unfortunately an impossibility. Planets just don't smash into each other...But the premise is fun, and the storyline, though hokie, makes for classic Hollywood entertainment...Look for appearances by some actors who would later become famous, including Hayden Roarke (Dr. Bellows from I Dream of Jeannie) and Frank Cady (Sam Drucker from Petticoat Junction)..."
4,CLASSIC SCI FI,"I'M A BIG FAN OF SCI FI. THIS CLASSIC IS VERY GOOD IN TERMS OF PLOT, ACTING, AND EVEN THE SPECIAL EFFECTS. I'M SURE IT WILL BRING ME MANY HOURS OF ENJOYMENT."
4,No doomsday for Barbara,"I could go on and on about this movie. About the silly aspects (Richard Derr's South African-ness, the to-the-second timing of the gravitational effects, the so-obvious painting of the landscape). About the serviceable acting. About the B-movie production values. About the less-than-successful special effects.In a pleasanter vein, I could go on even longer about the loveliness of Barbara Rush and her unappreciated acting talents.Besides Barbara, this movie's good points are it's thoughful plot with good characterizations and conflicts. It's a successful blend of exposition and adventure. And, it's a good procedural for the ending of the world.A lot of the thoughfulness was inherited from the British novel it was based on. But the novel was less colorful than the movie, so I'm glad for this incarnation. Especially, since this film freezes the youthful Barbara Rush in Old Hollywood's saturated color for men to dream on -- like some distant heavenly object."
4,George Pal is the granddaddy of sci-fi filmmakers,Good movie about the impending doom the world faces as a renegade red dwarf star hurtles its way on a collision course with the earth. A good screenplay which is only loosely based on the novel produced in the thirties by Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer. Special effects presented were state of the art at the time of this film's theatrical release; but they appear cheap and crude in comparison to what we have today.
5,One of the best scifi movie of it time.,If you are an Old scifi movie fan. You need to buy this movie.
5,Classic SF at its best,"When Worlds Collide is one of the finest science fiction offerings of the 1950s. It is the product of two great producers, Cecil B. DeMille and George Pal, and it is an excellent testiment to their work. The storyline is superb, the matte paintings beautiful, and the acting excellent."
3,They Collide REAL Good,"I've seen almost every 50's sci fi movie in a movie theater when I was a kid.Yet, I never saw this one. I was very interested to see how much I'd like it.It's pretty good, not great. The special effects are very good in some places and not in others. The plot is fairly interesting but far from classic.The DVD is worth getting and watching if you love 50's sci fi movies. If you don't, then pass."
2,Not exactly the best,"I'm not sure how long George Pal worked on this one, but it's not too good. It lacks credibility. Some of the SFX are good, others are appalling...like the view of the ""new Earth""...clearly a water color matte painting. Also, did George Pal ACTUALLY believe that the people of the Earth would submit to a ""lottery drawing"" as to ""who can go and who can't"" without a single protest until the very end? HARDLY BELIEVABLE."
4,When science tells a tall tale..,"A runaway star has tossed a few planets into our solar system. The second planet will slam into the Earth, destroying all right after the first alien planet does a close bypass, causing destruction and confusion.Scientists try to warn the governments but they fail to react, fear a panic, and the men of science turn to private businesses, who have the wealth, the smarts and the wish to survive. Doomsday gets nearer and nearer, mankind runs against time and fight off the fall of civilization as they build a spaceship to escape the doomed world.Great movie, while a tad outdated, I only took away a star because the DVD had very little in the way of extras. Nothing but the theatrical trailer. The DVD could hold so much more."
4,When Worlds Collide,"I wanted to see this movie, as I am a Model Builder and there has been a model of the Space Ship recently released, and I wanted a reference for it. The Movie was pretty good also"
3,"OK, But Not Among Pal's Best","The special effects for this film were considered good for 1951 but now appear to be obvious miniatures. Still the blast-off of the rocket was done quite well. The acting is generally two dimensional and no great depths are probed. There are no really gripping scenes as Pal would achieve in some later films.Pal's best picture was ""The War of the Worlds"" two years later with ""The Time Machine"" (1960) a close second. His earlier film ""Destination Moon"" was quite prescient -- during the Moon landing phase, the auto-pilot malfunctions and the captain has to take over manually similar to what actually happened with Apollo 11."
4,Terror thriller science fiction camp.,"I saw WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE as a kid, it disturbed me. The movie was made in the 50's at the height of doomsday fears generated by the threat of nuclear annihilation. It's a movie about human nature on a theme of Revelations and Noah's Ark. For people who think they have advanced scientific minds the movie may be regarded as naive and banal. This is obviously to miss the point. The movie is so extreme as to be amusing and yet it has a perverse sophistication. Suspend your critical faculties and drown in your apocalyptic imagination."
3,"Glencoe Geometry, Practice Workbook misses the answers","Glencoe Geometry, Practice Workbook misses the answers, it is difficult for parents to help their cildren. But in general it is O.K."
3,Not much of a help,"I love Joyce Meyer, she has helped change my life. But, this book was a big disappointment.Joyce has obviously not had a problem with binge eating or a thyroid disorder.She only needed to lose about 20 pounds and was never overweight in her childhood. She's really not a good resource on this topic.Buy all her other books, but not this one."
2,Practical,This book is practical. It did not tell me anything I haven't told myself. Guess I was looking for something more to be said that would help my conviction.
5,I love all of her books.,This is a very good and informative book. I would recommend it to my friends. I love all of her books.
3,For fans or historians,"Familiar tunes sound a bit fresh with these remastered early tapes. A treat for those of us who have listened to ""Never Mind the Bollocks . . . "" a thousand times."
5,Jazz Writing Simplified,"Ted Pease has been teaching jazz composition at Berklee for 25 years, and it shows in ""Jazz Composition"". I was amazed at how easily Pease broke down the process of writing and composing great jazz pieces. The CD was for me, the most influential component due to the fact that it includes music-writing exercises that have greatly inhanced my writing ability. This book is a must have for any student in a theory class."
5,Amazing book... Good explanations !!!,"I highly recommend this book for jazz analysis and composition, with the condition of understanding your chord/scale theory. It has sectional explanations which comes with exercises.The book is divided into major chapters like Melodic Considerations, Harmonic Considerations, Blues and Song Form, Arranging and Formatting Considerations, Metric Considerations, Fusion, Episodic Form, Extended Works...My favorite major chapter is MELODIC CONSIDERATIONS ( Melodic Rhythm, Interval Patterns, Melodic Variation via Modal Interchange, Melodies Based on Intervallic Patterns, etc etc etc)This book has detailed a lot of new concepts to me. However, I do not recommend this book for total beginners in Jazz."
4,Another mid-80s ECK classic OOP!!,"If you're a true fan of ECK, then you own this amazing mid 80s soul on LP or the very rare Japanese CD, as it's been OUT OF PRINT for a loooong time - WHY? This is one of my favorite ECK albums, featuring some of ther strongest material ever, including JUST FOR THE NIGHT (hear how Patrick Leonard's production would pave the way for later cuts by MADONNA) and several key tracks written & produced by THE SYSTEM, like electro-funk closer ""SO IN LOVE,"" which could be called ECK's take on YOU ARE IN MY SYSTEM! Also contains classic club tracks like HEARTBREAKER and OUT OF CONTROL, etc. - ECK's lung-busting vocals raise the roof - but sadly, RCA has chosen NOT to reissue ECK's old catalog - cmon!"
2,Bikini Zone Anti- Irritation Shave Gel,"I absolutely love this stuff it works great! The reason I only gave 2 stars was because when I received the box, 4 of the 6 tubes were busted which made me very angry. I had to use duct tape to keep it from all seeping out before I could use them. Next time I think that they should carefully examine the tubes before they package them. That is my only complaint. I will buy again, just hope this doesn't happen again."
3,works as advertised,"Although this item works as advertised it takes quite a bit of getting used to. Even after having used it for a while now I still am not comfortable with it. It does the job and I paid a reasonable price for it. If you must do editing on your umpc, pda, etc. then it will work. Battery life is good. If you purchase this keyboard keep your expectations reasonable."
3,Portable Keyboard,"Although I believe this is a good product, it did not work with my particular PDA (which was not a Palm)."
2,hummm,"i own the nokia n80 and i was wondering if it works with the nokia fones as well ? , one more thing i want to raise is does it have shortcuts to calender, notes etc??????"
1,Don't buy for the Centro!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM TO USE WITH A PALM CENTRO!!!! I ordered this to use with my Centro, and it doesn't work. After spending quite a bit of time on the net researching this problem, including on palm's own forums, and spending quite a bit of time on the phone with palm, it's become apparent that this is a well known problem with this device working with the Centro. You download the drivers, and it works the first time, but after you fold the keyboard closed, it won't work again unless you reload the drivers or maybe even have to do a hard reset!!! And palm calls this being ""compatible"" with the Centro!!!"
4,"Great BT Keyboard that works with the HP iPAQ 211, and does what I need.","Great product that actually works with the iPAQ 211 and at a cheaper price than the HP equivalent. The extra features on the keyboard do not work however for the iPAQ 211 but I didn't buy the keyboard for that, I bought it to just be a straight forward BT keyboard for the iPAQ 211. If that is what you are looking for then this is your best bet, if you want bells and whistles you'll have to look elsewhere.On a side note there are no drivers for this device that work with the iPAQ 211. To connect you have to create a bluetooth keyboard shortcut...DO NOT try to Pair the keyboard first, the pairing should take place during the creation of the shortcut. If you have trouble linking it to the iPAQ 211, try connecting it to a PC."
3,BT Keyboard is the boom diggidy,"Okay so I've just upgraded to a TX and needed to get a new keyboard, the Palm 3245WW Wireless BT keyboard answered all my questions with out breaking a sweat. Installation was a breeze, and it was operational in less than 5 minutes after a hotsync. The functions are rather easy to see in blue on the KB as well as the added benifit of being able to recharge in the cradle while I was still using the device. The down side of all this is that the keyboard it self is rather flimsy so if you're not going to be using a flat surface you need to be carful. But all in all it's a good buy for the money."
5,New Life for the Palin Bluetooth Keyboard - with HP TouchPad,"I used the Palm BLUETOOTH KEYBOARD WITH the Palm TX for several years. It and the Palm TX fell into disuse. Recently I obtained a HP 32GB TouchPad. It comes with Bluetooth built in as a standard feature.I put fresh batteries into the keyboard, turned it on and enabled Bluetooth on the TouchPad.A few min later I AM USING it to look up the users manual. While browsing I found this page and wondered what they cost.I am using it to type this review on the TouchPad. It is a great deal more convenient than the on screen keyboard, it is large enough to allow touch typing. And folds in half to make it small enough to take with you anyplace that you will want to take the TouchPad.I give it a full 5 stars."
3,Ok...ish,"I got this keyboard as a birthday gift to connect to my Treo 680. I works fine most of the time but it has this annoying way of disconnecting from the Treo at the most inconvenient times. The problem here is that the only way to reconnect is to disable bluetooth and do the whole ""reconnect dance"". This particularly frustrating when I am in class typing notes and it happens.I also think that it sometimes resets the phone and this is even worst, because at that time I have to wait until the phone reboots (and if you own a Treo 680 you know it can take a while to come back up)....When is does works though, it is a beautiful thing to have. Just beware."
4,Majik Does It Again!,"J. Majik has never failed me. I love all his stuff and this CD is no exception. Near the beginning, the music pauses to present a non-musical segment. This reminds me of when this happens in Bjork's song ""There's More to Life Than This"" from her ""Debut"" CD. I love how non-music oddly enough ends up enhancing the music. It gives it a syncopation, or some term like that. This disc has more songs than your average continuous mix. Thus, if you love a cut, it may feel too short for you here. But I like what I'm experiencing. I'm a terrible latecomer and novice to DnB, but I like how this has added to what little I own."
4,You get what you pay for...,"Like all Timex Ironman watches I've owned, this one has so far met the challenge of the abuse I put watches through. All the features & functions work well, but I should have wondered at the low cost. It's not just the 20-lap memory difference between this and the 50-lap model: this model has only one alarm, and only 2 time zones. So, for basics built like a brick chickenhouse, this is a great watch. It's just not the fully-featured watch I'm used to in other Timex Ironman models."
5,Great Watch,"I bought this watch to time me while riding and running and it does the job. The lap feature is great, though a little difficult to understand at first.It looks nice and the size fits my wrist well.Overall, I love the watch. I only wish it had a longer countdown timer, but its other features are great."
5,awesome tool!,while it doesnt come with instructions it is very easy to figure out and works every time on at least the 3rd try!
2,Rat urinates from above,"We got this for our pet rat so she would have more room. For a few weeks it worked great: it's huge, she can climb all over it, and, though a little big, it fits securely on our aquarium. Then disaster struck: she discovered that if she urinated in the corners of the cage it would land outside her cage (and she would have a cleaner cage) all over our kitchen floor. This expensive topper is now in storage."
2,"paint chips, awkward lid.","The lid never lined up properly no matter how I tried to fix it, it's always hard to close because it slides back and forth on the 'hinge' (that is really just O-rings). The spring locks (to lid & to tank) are a pain in the rear... the tank spring locks popped off randomly so I stopped using them. The paint is chipping off everywhere even though its only about a year old... I clean with 50:50 vinegar/water & dry well, can't imagine why the paint is falling off so bad..Don't bother with this topper...(I'm shopping for a new topper or a larger tank... thought I'd share my opinion on this one since I've had it for a year & it's already getting shabby)"
5,Excellent and really for beginners,"I learned a great deal from this book. It's well-written, and the explanations are in plain language and easy to understand, yet not dumbed-down. It gives the how-to's without requiring expensive equipment and explains how to do things with simple equipment so beginners really can learn how to use photographic lighting professionally."
1,Photographic Lighting Simplified,Do not buy this book. She simply states her opinion about random name brands and what she thinks you should buy without explaining any of the reason why.
3,Good beginner book but black and white pages,This book has some simple lighting set ups to help the beginner but the reason I only gave it 3 stars is I found the book boring to look at. Most of the book is in black and white photos. I like a writer that gets to the point pretty quick and simple and found some of the reading monotone kind of like the black and white pictures.
2,Pretty good information,Good basic information but not very detailed. Not for the intermediate or advanced photographer.
3,Oldsmobile91,"If you like music videos you may like this one. It's ok they have some good single videos by Ice Cube like ""The Game"" ""Wicked"" ""We be clubbin"" the only thing is the tracking was not to good on the video. Jay Z will never be as good of a star as Ice Cube, he just does not have the talent. Cube won in this video."
5,not a cloud in sight,excellent album painting a secure mix of singer-songwriter passions. harry explores many facets of everyday life intermingled with savy childhood memories we'd all love to have.
5,Fantastically subtle and methodically intense.,"Im so very sorry to see so many low ratings for such a fantastic film. I'm sure this is due to people just wanting more of the same garbage that is already out there and being disappointed by something they almost certainly found to be boring and empty. However this film is incredibly sophisticated, subtle, methodical, and intense. This is not a fast paced action film. This is a meticulously crafted work of art by one incredibly talented filmmaker. A character study where the viewer must be on his toes to pick up the paranoia that the protagonist is experiencing. It's gorgeously shot, handsomely acted by Clooney, and an absolute delight to watch. This is for people who love sophisticated yet subtle cinema. I can also see this films roots in the 70s and can only hope this is the start of a building trend. This is a 5 star film and is being misunderstood and misrepresented by those giving it 1 star."
5,american,"M. Oleson,I completely agree with your review of this gem of a film.Clooney knows how to act!This is not a crowd pleasing action/thriller movie but rather in the vein ofFrench (European) movie.I also agree with your assessment of 'I'm not sure a little Italian village would be home to so many gorgeous prostitutes. 'But I really enjoyed this film."
5,A serious movie,"This is not ""Oceans 11"" or any such thing. It is a serious, suspenseful film and a very moral film. A film about a fall from grace.Superb performances all the way around. We don't expect this sort of film from Clooney so some looking for light-hearted farewill be disappointed."
4,"Interesting characters, intense theme, slowwwww revelation","""The American"" is a foreign film. Yes, the main character is American and over half the dialogue is English, but the structure, pace, plot, and script is decidedly European. If you enjoy foreign films, you'll enjoy The American. George Clooney plays a cold assassin seeking warmth and human connection in his life. His struggle is immediately apparent as the movie intensely protrays the lack of trust and absence of intimacy an assassin must have to stay alive. The women in the film are sexy and hot. The scenery is beautiful. The supporting characters simple and honest, sharply contrasting with the dark secrets pulsing through the American's veins. The film builds nicely to the end but it might take a bit of discipline to stick with the film to the conclusion. Things happen quickly as the film wraps up so it is worth sticking around."
2,Not my cup of tea,"the hero isn't suppose to die in the story. It was ok, but I didn't care for the ending. It sucked."
1,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"This movie was just plain terrible! It was pointless and watching it, was like watching paint dry. Clooney hardly speaks, everything was predictable, nothing made sense or was explained. It was just a complete waste of time. The one interesting thing I did want to mention is that throughout the movie, director Anton Corbijn shows everything done so methodically and wants to be as realistic as possible, however Clooney is seen driving on the left side of the car and on the right side of the road in Europe. Like the movie, even the setting has a huge hole in it. Honestly guys, dont even waste your time on this one."
3,Love scene,The two ladies in it are great looking I like about anything George is in Good Ky boy enjoy watching him
1,Slow moving and lame plot,"If there are redeeming qualities of this film I missed them! It was billed as heart throbbing thriller! It was not! Slow moving and hard to follow. More disjointed than the descendents.Who were the swedes? Why go to the trouble to build a gun to kill ""the American""A waste of time unless you are 15 years old and like graphic sex!"
2,Slow unoriginal Italian Landscape,"Simply boring. If you need to watch another movie and have already seen the others, then this will do.OR...if you want to see a beautiful young woman having sexual ecstacy and walking in the nude then this might serve. She gets 5 stars, but the movie not so much. Actually, maybe Solaris is a little better, but I remember it as being very slow as well.The Italian landscape and village areas are very nice...it's like an easychair visit to Italy so on a large screen it's very nice to see."
1,What were they thinking?,"oh my goodness!How painfully boring! The 'meat' of the movie could be told in 5 maybe 10 minutes, but to add time to make a movie it seemed they chose to add one incredibly painful, long, exaggerated traveling shot after another, as well as the incredibly slow, painful shots of 'building a gun, picking out tools' etc.! UGH!Added to all this, there were no characters one could care about. Filled with cliche's, like the prostitute who dreamed of meeting a rich man to take her away from it all.I watched to the end to see if there might be a twist or some punch added, but it stayed a completely, painfully boring movie to the very, very end!"
1,What a waste of time,"****SPOILER ALERT****This review is of the movie, not the dvd. This movie was a complete disappointment and waste of time: two hours of basically following a depressed George Clooney around....a bit of sex with prostitutes, a bit of suspense while trying to figure out what the story could possibly be about, a bit of action at the end.... and then he dies. There wasn't a storyline to catch onto. One wouldn't even know he was a ""hitman"" except the small blurb on the online movie schedule. This was based on a book, but I don't remember the title. Perhaps the way the book was written was too difficult to translate to a movie...."
1,A waste of time...,"I kept waiting for this movie to get going... It never did. It was boring mixed with gratuitous, unnecessary sex scenes. Even the ending was horrible. I am much relieved I rented and didn't buy this terrible film."
1,Stinks,"If you like movies about nothing with no point, or watching clooney speak about 10 words despite him being in every scene, have a blast. This movie is worthless."
1,Boooooring,"Seeing the previews for this movie made it seem like an exciting action movie. Well, it was anything but. The plot developed slow and I was forcing myself to watch it hoping something exciting would happen. I was so bored I quit watching the movie and went off and did something else. I came back to it with fresh approach only to have my original impression reaffirmed. I am fan of George Clooney own several movies he stars in, but this is by far my least favorite."
1,Previews Are Not What They Seem,The most boring movie ever. Waste of time. I kept waiting for it to pick up because the previews made it look like a pretty good spy movie but you will feel duped if that's what you think it is. Clooney spends most of the movie chewing gum and assembling a gun that will eventually be used to kill him. Why not just kill him and get it over with. The sex scenes were over the top and rediculous. The ending stinks as well as the rest of it.
1,wasted wear on my tv,"This is the worst film that I have seen in 50 years. My wife asked me to turn it off and let her watch the cooking channel, and if Rachel Ray had fried chicken feet with feather pastries on the side I could have enjoyed that over the end of this movie. The next morning my wifes' first question was what did I want to do with ""The American"" blu ray disc. I thought of people I dont like, then said that would be unfair to give it to anyone except George Clooney who I was sure had discarded his copy of it by now. Finally I suggested that we double bag it [in case one broke] and place it in a box outside where the dogs could relieve themselves on it for a few days and then perhaps, we would have found some useful purpose for this film disc ""The American""."
2,don't expect fast pace action!,no vibe here.. i thought it was boring.. very very slow pace.. action almost next to none.. but i did enjoy seeing the boobies =) all in all.. it was shot beautifully but story and character development was just down the hole. some people says you would need intellectual to understand the movie but i say WRONG!
1,An Excuse for George Clooney to get a Paid Vacation In Italy,I watched this today on Netflix and when it was over I gave it.... One Star. I would have given it less if I could Have.Mike
3,Excuse to be in Italy,"Too slow and downright boring at times. It gave George Clooney the opportunity to film in his beloved Italy, and granted, the scenery was lovely. Trying way too hard and possibly nostalgically to reproduce that '70s film effect. Where were the police in Italy when everyone was getting shot up as in an old spaghetti western?"
1,Reminded me of 2001 space odyssey,Very little action just slow moving without (Much) Dialog. I kept wondering why I stayed watching this movie. 4 of us started watching this movie and my wife left 30 minutes into it and started doing chores pretty boring. Also had nudity for no apparent reason which sucks if you have kids running around the house.
1,2 hours I'll never get back,"The trailers for The American deceptively made this film look like an action/thriller it is neither. This movie quoting my wife ""was boring"" and I totally agree with her. The only redeeming value of this film is the nudity (I know juvenile, but true) Save you money, time, and sanity and don't bother watching this even when it comes to TV."
1,THE OUTHOUSE STINKS,"I've taken a crap more interesting than this. The best part of it was the nude scene of Violante Placido, and that wasn't worth the money. Whatever he got paid for this wasn't enough to put his name on it let alone be in it. Sometimes even big name stars can't carry a movie, and this one is a back breaker. I'm not saying don't watch it, just don't buy it if you don't have to, cause even at the used prices it's not worth it. They should have taken the money it cost to make this movie and flushed it down the drain. I've seen a lot of boring movies, but I can't remember any being this slow and boring. You find yourself wondering who's going to get shot, so you can shoot them yourself just to get this thing over with. I've seen documentaries faster than this, and I'm not much on watching documentaries cause there usually slow, but I finished watching this and I can't remember why, what I do know is that I didn't get my monies worth. ONE STAR FOR NUDITY, mostly because I had to."
1,Boring Movie,"I got the movie in great condition, but was horribly disappointed with the most boring movie I have ever had to endure."
1,Totally Boring..don't bother,"We gave this movie a chance...it made no sense, it was so boring . Totally stupid. This must have been a ""pet project of Clooney"". Pass the Pepto Bismol..."
1,Boring and pointless.,"Boring and pointless. . .This is not a thriller, or a character study. It's slow and boring and should not have been made into a full-length movie."
1,Slow and Boring,"I don't understand why did George Clooney accepted this role!!! The events in this movie move so slowly; I actually fell asleep in the middle of it. What is the point of this film? I don't get it. The plot is very weak, and shows lack of technical knowledge of the weapons used. I expected a film with this caliber of star and director to be better written. The only good thing about this film is the cinematography, which showcases the beauty of the Italian country side and it's old tiny villages. Add to that the constant extreme close up of George Clooney's face and his naked behind (who by the way looks very old in it). Finally, what is the point of all the nudity and sex scenes? does it add to the story besides trying to proof that Mr Clooney is still a sex symbol and can get any European Beauty to bed!! I am very disappointed with the steady stream of bad, hastily made Hollywood movies."
1,Just really slow and boring,"This is just a very slow paced, somewhat boring movie. I'm not interested in any of the characters and have no sympathy for them either. Clooney has the dimension of the movie poster and is just about as animated. I don't know what to call this movie. It's not action, hardly drama, not a love story, not a thriller, just kind of boring and plodding.I think the best word for it is sterile."
1,What A Waste,It trys to sell itself as an action movir but it is not. It plan and simple sucks do not waste your time or money on it. I am a Clooney fan.
1,Not worth your time or money,This movie was a huge disappointment. They made the trailer look like an action movie (I was picturing something like the Bourne movies) and it was nothing like that. It was very slow and boring. Nothing much happened in the entire movie and there was no point at all. Most of the movie was Clooney driving around and shots of him looking into the mirror.Bottom line...not worth your time or money.
1,Life Is Too Short ....................,Life is too short to have to sit through this hugely disappointing film. Clooney is Clooney but the film is a total bore.
1,Just awful! Not what we expected at all!,"We had such high hopes for this so called 'thriller', instead we were subject to too much nudity, no plot, very little dialogue, just a dumb movie all around. He has done such good work, and wasted his time with this one. At the end of this movie I can tell you that the majority of the movie goers in our theater, said, 'Thank God, that one is over!"".. We actually laughed with each other at spending our money on such an awful movie. Throughout most of the movie we kept saying, is this going anywhere? Well, it didn't, it just got worse. I have not seen such an awful film in a long time due to the fact that I watch reviews closely and I am not sure the great reviews given here were for the same movie! Don't waste your time."
3,Slow moving,"Like what the rest of the reviewers said, this is not an action movie so, set your expectations correctly before you watch it.Pros: This movie is more European than American. Its use of symbols is more prolific than a typical American movie. Gunsmithing terminologies are quite accurate in terms of the specs of the rifle and needs of the buyer. The live-firing is somewhat controversial, though. Artistic side of things, in terms of how the scenes are composed and the use of landscapes, lines and geometry, were quite nicely done.Cons: It takes its time to develop the characters, although I wished the dialogues are more creative and interesting. Plot was pretty shallow and negligible. Way too much sexual scenes. Those scenes were also too long. Additionally, I failed to see how they contributed to the film."
4,Low-Fi Middle Age Spy Drama,"You'll not see amazing jumps from one floor to the next through windows and then rolling across the floor and out the door stunt moves, nor the entire entire geopolitical structure hanging in the balance while it awaits a last second salvation by an all too prescient secret agent. This film is about what happens when a person awakens to the hard truth of what their chosen occupation has done to them and of the difficulty in removing oneself from such a predicament. The cinematography gives stunning views from many aspects, the R rating is not for language or violence, it's an adult film dealing with ugly subjects for a time when you have about 2 hours to sit still and take it in; just don't expect Jason Bourne or Jack Bauer on this job."
3,a thoughtful character study,"some people may find this film slow.granted,it's not action packed.but it's not intended to be.i think it's more of a character study than anything else.George Clooney plays an assassin living abroad who agrees to one last job,and then wants out of the business for good.the film deals with his internal conflict,and shows what a lonely sad existence the character has.it's a bleak existence,to be sure.the pacing is very deliberate,but the film isn't what i would call boring.it is well acted and well directed.the tone of the movie matches the existence of the main character.if you don't have a lot of patience,this movie is not for you.otherwise,id say,give it a try.for me,The American is a 3/5"
2,"Not bad, but it tended to drag in parts.","Simply put, this movie was a little slow. It felt like a few themes were left unexplored or unresolved or maybe I was just too bored to notice they had been resolved. It looks like the trailers over-marketed this movie as they commonly do with Clooney films. If you're a diehard Clooney fan, this movie might be a subpar diversion."
3,An action film minus the action,"A hired assassin finds himself to now be a target, and he commences one final mission in Italy. While there, he develops a relationship with local prostitute, and suspects that she may be involved in attempts on his life. The thinking man's action film, this movie's slow pacing saps the thrills out of what could have been a riveting action drama. All is not lost, though, as the movie does just enough to keep the viewer interested, and how the film plays out is an interesting topic of discussion as you leave the theater."
3,Better for European Audience,"We Americans are so used to a fast pace and a bow tied around a closed package at the end. It's not what you'll find here. I admire Clooney for taking chances; sometimes they achieve more than imagined, sometimes less than intended. This film, unhappily, falls into the latter category, even for this reviewer who has spent much time in both France and Italy and knows her way around European cinema. The entire film has an underlying tone of existential angst with a pinch of Antonioni and, though not sung, the lilting ennui of Demy's Umbrella's of Cherbourg, which worked brilliantly 50 years ago. The ambiance is retro but today just doesn't hit a resonant chord. Cloony is always easy on the eyes, and his love interest is pure whipped cream. The Abruzzo hill town is a feast for eyes. And the music is good. Whatever you might expect from the film, however, it's not what you'll get."
2,Not the best,This film is not a thriller by any means. Very slow with some action thrown in to wake you up. It seems like an artsy European film that you need to be very patient with. If you love to just watch George then watch the movie. The plot is OK but could have been done much better.
1,HORRIBLE,It seriously hurt to give this movie one star..I'd recommend you do not waste your TIME or money on this movie..
1,boring piece of doo doo,"this long boring movie was a a disappointment in many ways. It was boring and long, had no plot, and ended badly. What was George Cloony thinking when he made this? Dont waste even 99 cents on this dud."
1,More of a documentary about castel del monte and coffee,"It depends how many of these kind of films you have seen before, but I found it terrible.The film seems more about Italian landscape and drinking coffee than anything else.The acting at one point was terrible. Here is an example.George Clooney is minding his own business having a coffee (what else ?) in a coffee bar.His prostitute friend and her friend both drop in on the off chance.She asks him if they want to meet that night. Here is the dialogue:Pros: Where shall we meet ?long silenceGeorge. The usual placelong silenceProtitute: where is that ?even longer stoney silencegeorge looks at her friend. Her friend smiles in embarassment.george: Lets meet somewhere newprostitute: okthe prostitute and friend leave the coffee barend of scene.I had to cringe. The film is just full of these kind of disjointed scenes.The best way to describe it is like the Bourne supremacy but without the action and suspense.Sorry two thumbs down."
1,A complete waste of my time,"I love spy/thiller movies.Believe me,this ISN'T one.One of the most boring movies I have ever seen.Don't waste your time or money."
1,SEE George Clooney...,SEE George Clooney take out multiple hired assassins without breaking a sweat!SEE George Clooney experience angst and doubt!SEE George Clooney gaze soulfully into the middle distance!SEE George Clooney gaze stupidly at full-frontal female nudity!SEE George Clooney have kinky sex with prostitutes!SEE George Clooney sit handsomely at restaurant tables!SEE George Clooney manufacture an impossibly accurate rifle from random parts taken from a garage!SEE George Clooney have ptsd flashbacks!SEE (and hear) George Clooney's bizarrely tangential conversations with a Catholic priest!SEE George Clooney walk the streets of an Italian village!SEE George Clooney commune with nature!SEE George Clooney do calisthenics!What you see is what you get.Be warned!
2,George Clooney Being Quiet In Nice Suits In Europe,"This movie should air on The Travel Channel. It's very clean and everything is just so and Clooney keeps getting this very fresh haircut and doing sit-ups and the pseudo-sophisticated ladies will love it and the men will get to see some shooting and there's nice vistas and then it is over.For a movie star, Clooney has made shockingly few great films, as a leading man or director.This one is like bad Bullit.Anton Corbjin makes quiet, good looking, hollow movies that feel like the celeb photog and music video guy he is."
4,Misleading advertising done for this movie!!!,"Of course I AM GOING TO LIKE THIS MOVIE... for the genre, it's as realistic as a movie can get...the world of espionage is not how 95% of the movies would have you believe...rent this if you like you action psychological, your adventure with a mix of paranoia, your characters flawed but hopeful, filled with the lust for life we all crave...To bad they advertised it as a ""balls-out non-stop action rollercoaster ride"" type flick; because thats the REAL reason why people are disappointed by the movie...I wish hollywood made more movies like this!"
5,Good European Thriller,"This film reminds me of some of the really good European style thrillers of the 70's: for example, classics like George C. Scott's ""The Last Run"", Nicholson's ""The Passenger"", and more recently ""Ronin"". It has a very realistic European feel, with Clooney really the only American actor on scene, captured especially well on location. The pace of the film is suspensful with Clooney underplaying every scene with terse minimalistic dialog. The co-actors are all very good, and Clooney is at his very best, playing out of his usual cynical and gregarious character. The cinematography, as some have noted, is outrageously good. Overall, an extremely entertaining film, with a unique feel."
2,Disappointing,"What a very slow and uninteresting film. It's pretty easy to figure out the plot so there's no real surprise there. The dialogue and action are minimal. I suspect this is some type of homage to the old spaghetti-Westerns of decades past. If you're into more ""artsy"" films, then the camera-work will probably appeal to you. (The whole movie has a certain European feel to it.) Otherwise, this is a very disappointing movie.Not recommended."
2,This got three stars??,"I just wasted two hours of my life. I thought ""How bad can it be? It has George"". Flawed thinking. Don't do it."
2,Sorry George,"Normally any movie with George Clooney is a better movie simply because he is in it. True, he is easy on the eyes, but I also think he is an amazing actor. But even George could not save this one.First of all it is a very quiet movie. There is way too much time with no dialogue going on. From a plot perspective, it was very thin. Anyone could guess how this movie was going to end and who the bad guys were in the first 15 minutes. How many movies does Hollywood have to make about ""the one final job and I am out""?Even the ending you see coming has more holes than a pasta strainer. I don't want to give away anything to anyone who has the patience to sit through this, but George decides he wants to start a new life with a lady of the evening - but the film shows almost no interaction between them other than physical The character George plays is way too smart and complex to fall in love over a physical encounter.Sorry George. I will try and not let this affect our long term relationship."
2,It stunk....,I was dissapointed that Clooney would have signed up for this movie. Definitely not the caliber of the Oceans series. I think they made the movie up as they went along !
2,Difficult to follow,"By the time the movie ended, I finally understood some of the premise, but I was lost most of the movie."
3,Falsely Advertised as Another Bourne-esque Espionage Thriller,"I think this movie got a pretty a bad rap from people who didn't know what they were walking into. Let's be fair, it is a Focus Feature. They're not really known for action now, are they? I agree that the trailers were very misleading, but that does not take away from what the actual product is. It's a quiet, slow paced homage to Italian cinema, and a character study of a lonely assassin. As a suspense thriller, it has its moments, but I wouldn't say they were great. George Clooney was pretty good as Jack. Not his best performance, but it didn't require much from him to begin with. I have to say, Violante Placido is a reason for any male to sit through this somber film more than once. She seems too beautiful an actress to be so willing to show it all so much, but there it was, and was, and was...Rental."
2,Not a Thriller,"Short and to the point, you HAVE to be a fan of film noir in order to like this movie. (Noir is French for black) It is SLOW, has impeccable acting and cinematography and will keep you very straight faced the entire time because there is not ONE moment of levity in it. If you want to feel good after watching a movie watch something else."
2,What a drag...,"Very slow. We almost turned it off in mid movie but hoped it would take a turn for the better; but found out we should have followed our first inclination and turned it off without further wasting our time.Beyond being a depressing film, some sections are subtitled (poorly). Half the time the subtitles were up, we couldn't read them because they were very small, white letters against a light colored background. You can get the gist of what they say but it is irritating nonetheless. I feel like I need to watch another movie just to lift my spirits."
2,Ultimately Disappointing and Unimaginative,"I too was mislead in thinking this was more a thriller that what it turned out to be. Yet that wasn't the problem with the film. Nor was the slow pace, scenic cinematography, the symbolism, occasional subtitles, the full frontal nudity, the minimal action scenes, the acting, the problem at all. It was kinda like a ""Lost in Translation"" of hired assassins last job movies. The script is what ultimately leads you astray from potentially a good film into a semi-predictable ending with some head-scratching subplots. Clooney was great in his stoic demeanor aching to break free from his life and actually connect with someone for a change. The smoking hot Italian prostitute he eventually falls for is his lifeline out of the nomadic solitude he leads. Yet the film makers throw some incomprehensible and unexplained actions along his way and never give the audience a proper payoff."
2,Disappointing,"After having this movie on my to-view list for what I thought was far too long, I finally sat down to watch what I thought would be a really wnticing movie.Whilst George Clooney's acting is indeed, captivating, the rest of the movie drags on painfully. \nothing really happens and nothing is really being said on any level. The ethical sub-text that could be attributed would be far fetched in my oppinion.The aim of the movie was, I think, a quiet but strong story. Unfortunatley, I think this was a seemingly endless film reel with no conclusive storyline or idea. So if you have an hour and a half at your dispoasal, do yourself a favour and watch any other George Clooney film where the acting will be as good (as it was here), but the story will sustain that."
4,"Great scenery, especially in blu-ray Hi-Def...","Decent movie with great scenery, especially in blu-ray Hi-Definition. Reminded me of an old time Spy Movie. No explosions, and really no car chases. Artsy, but good. I would like to mention that only one disc comes in the case, and not two as stated. Apparently, the ""Digital Copy"" has to be downloaded via Internet, and is only available for a limited time...Pete"
3,"Good, not great, and NOT innovative","The positives: Beautifully shot in Northern Italy. If you've ever been there you'd understand. Great interplay between the characters - the burnt-out hitman who'd like to move to a paranoia-free life, the prostitute who's looking for a permanent connection, the priest who really wants to free a darkened soul from his torment. The negatives: you could see the plot ending from miles away. George Clooney's one-expression-fits-all-situations acting is a detraction, but the interaction of the characters makes up for it. Overall: I'd watch it again."
3,So Kay,"Not the action thriller you would suppose it to be. Very slow, plodding kind of movie. Lots of technical and plot problems for me. Yet, I still kinda liked it. I never really figured out who or what he was, assassin, terrorist, murderer, weapons dealer? Wife almost gave up on this one twice and in the end she said it was awful. More of a psycho thriller maybe. The whole movie is plot and character development I guess. Would not watch again but it filled a couple of hours on a cold day."
1,Doesn't Make Sense,"Why did the guy who wanted to kill Clooney's character enact such a complicated set up? He could have just put a bomb in the car that Clooney gets into at the beginning of the movie and finished him off without a problem. And the hitmen that tried to kill Clooney's character throughout the movies were hilariously bad. Instead of shooting from behind cover they just stand out in the open and let Clooney gun them down. Finally, the movie is ridiculously slow and boring. I wish I could give it negative stars."
3,What do you like?,"I have already written about this movie in one of the discussions here. This movie seems to provoke some pretty heated discussions. There are 18 five star reviews, being lead by one reviewer in particular. There are 29 one star reviews, some of which are difficult to make sense of. I am sort of in the middle. It is the kind of movie I like, but it has the kind of ending that I hate. But it doesn't make any difference what I think. It doesn't matter what anybody else here thinks, or any critic thinks. In the abstract, there are good movies and bad movies, but it's just that we can never all agree what they are. There are only movies that we either like or don't like. Just never purchase a DVD of a movie that you have not already seen in a theater, or viewed as a rental. You can only decide for yourself."
1,Pathetic,"This is by far the worst movie I have seen in years. The plot is nonexistent; the acting is abysmal and the fake emotions sickening. One watches this movie for its entire length without a clue as to what is going on. But its worst feature is its entire lack of plausibility. In the end it is,nothing but a cowboys and indians shoot em up movie . . . who can draw first. This movie,is beyond pathetic, an insult to any intelligent person. Stay away."
2,none,"the plot is confusing, George Clooney plays an agent of who, or what. the scenery is not as i expected very little shown of the city or place where it was filmed. Didnt like it much. I expected a better role for George Clooney other actors dont know who they are."
2,good for the insomniac,This is not what the trailer seems to sell. This is more a film noir except it doesnt make much sense and does not develop into anything particularly interesting.
1,Horid!!!!!!!!!!,"Without question the single worst waste of time and single biggest waste of money all rolled up in one. Clooney has really never made a good movie, but this movie sets the low bar lower. It just goes to show how desperate worn out actors are for money to agree to ""act"" in this pathetic movie. Don't waste your time on this one,."
1,Waste of time,"I'm not even going to waste my time with a thorough and in depth review of why you shouldn't waste your time with this movie, although I could."
1,wish i could give it NO stars,total wast of time. just dont watch it. i got more mad as it went on. after it was over i thought just resell it but i dont want to do that to the next person !!!!!!!!
2,Empty Promise,"In the 1950s, Miles Davis introduced something called modal music. A simple melody was the foundation for highly skilled and creative musicians to solo around. I assume that was the concept behind this flick. A simple, uncomplicated story: a highly competent assassin loses his taste for the job, falls in love with a prostitute, then, well the ending (I won't spoil it). OK, pretty mundane story, I thought this was to be the backdrop for some pretty serious acting chops to be offered. Umph, wrong! Clooney and company were not up to the challenge if that was in fact the idea. After chatting a bit with my wife after it was over, I suddenly realized why this movie was really made. It was a tax write off for Clooney's Italian Villa. Two stars only for the beautiful Italian country side. Bottom line: skip this dreadfully boring, journeyman level exercise in acting and film making."
1,"Paint-by-numbers ""thriller""...","I have never seen Clooney look so out of his element. Not a drop of character in this guy, no edge. When he's in bed with the hooker, the sex is even worse than most Hollywood fake sex & that's saying something.This film looks like it came out of a beginning filmmaker's kit. I think someone dropped a few of the pieces opening the box.Well, some people collect paint-by-numbers paintings so I guess there's always a market as good old PT Barnum once said."
1,Boring,"This is the most unthrilling thriller I have ever seen. By the end of the movie I could have cared less for any of the characters, and the ending was completely unsurprising as well.Have I mentioned how very boring it was?"
1,Sucked,Worst movie - total dissapointment. Advertised like an action / spy flick and grabs you with the opening then just hits the wall. Drags you through crap for the whole rest of the film. Total bait and switch. Pissed that they advertised it as an action flick instead of for what it is.
1,Clooney Bust!,"I'm usually a fan of most George Clooney films, but this movie was terrible! Very Slow, for a movie about an assasin. It never really came together to make any sense! Never really tied in any of the other characters and to how/why they were involved."
2,Not my genre,"I purchased this book for my book club. While interesting, it is not my typical read. We have not yet discussed the book."
3,Africa and all its contradictions,"This book presents a segment of war-torn, third-world Africa and all its contradictions. Africa and its peoples are seen at their best and their worst - ignorant yet wise, ruthless yet compassionate, impoverished yet resourceful, war-scarred but hopeful. The tales told through the eyes of an outsider, American relief worker Jack Diaz, are compelling and thought-provoking on many different levels - this is the book's strength. To me, the book's weakness is Diaz as a main character. He is aimless, incredibly and shamelessly irresponsible, without his own moral compass, and has absolutely no idea what he is doing in Africa. A ""perfect"" or saintly main character would have been unbelievable and annoyingly patronizing, but Diaz's flaws overshadowed and distracted from what I believe to have been the strength of the insight into the lives of this war-torn region."
4,"Le blanc la, c'est un fou!","I don't know how much of this book is fictionalized and how much is based on reality, but it makes Tony D'Souza out to either be the best or worst Peace Corps volunteer ever. As an RPCV myself (Cameroon, 2005-2007), I read this book with a heavy sense of recognition of themes from my own service in francophone Africa - fufu and peanut sauce outside your neighbor's hut, for example, or the constant juxtaposition between the expansive grandeur of the African sky and the monotony and grinding pettiness of daily life on the ground. D'Souza made me remember much of that.For someone with no experience living in Africa, this is an entertaining and, at times, bewildering book. For those that do, it's still very funny, but sometimes also has a poignancy that stems from the emotional honesty of its author. Tu as bien fait, Adama."
3,CLARK CLIFFORD: COUNSEL AND SELF-FLATTERER,A very easy read. Interesting anecdotes makes large book manageable. Clifford has a tendency to cite flattering assesments of his input to history. Still very worth while reading for amateur historians.
3,Top-notch Anime - Volume 5,"The fifth DVD volume of the Robotech series contains six excellent episodes concerning various efforts to bring peace among the Humans and the Zentradi, including the eyecatches to and from commercial breaks. In the late 1980s, F.H.E. had released a videotape of these same episodes edited together to form one ""movie;"" while that was okay, this presentation by ADV Films is far superior, allowing easy access to any particular episode on may wish to view.This is one of my favorite anime series. However, I can only rate this DVD as a ""3"" for two reasons. First, concerning the DVD construction, the main menu begins with a brief clip from the series without any actual menu selections immediately available, which can cause confusion for some users. Secondly, and by far the most significant downfall, this DVD is NOT compatible with the PlayStation2, whereas the first DVD in the series worked flawlessly with the PS2."
4,Beautiful,"My husband bought this beautiful dreidel for me. The 1t one had a chip on one corner, so I returned it and ordered another one. It is perfect. Great addition to my collection."
4,This rules!!!!,Last month I went to a cheapo resale store and bought a black sega sports dreamcast and it rocks!!!! Who care about specs when its fun! The graphics are sweet and Jet Set radio is really fun!This is a must have for any video game finatic!!!(I gave it 4 stars because the games are kind of old and they dont make it anymore)
3,Software needed here but what is there is great,I bought this set last Christmas because the PS 2 system was not available and this had the most advance graphics out at the time. The system is great. The VMU offers the opportunity to play against another player and keep strategies in confidence. The NFL and NBA games will leave you drooling for the updates.There is a good inventory of used games but not the variety as in the PS2. This lack of games is what lost it two stars
1,bad deal,"I found a dreamcast with NFL2K, WorldseriesBaseball2K and NBA2K a controller for 99.99 at JCPENNY"
3,A Gamer from jasper florida is wrong,"ummm hello there is no way that the dreamcast is as good as the playstation2 I have them both an x-box and a Game cube, i admit it is a very good system but not as good as the playstation2. For one SEGA totally pulled the plug on this system I'm pretty sure that they dont make games for it any more, and if they do it will stop shortly. It's a good system w/good games but not as good as the ps2. and i think that the ps2 is worth the ca$h with."
3,"Way Better than PS2, but 1 Controller?","Okay, finally DC comes with a game included, but there's 2 probs. 1.) Not everyone likes sports, having NFL2K1 as the only game to come with it isn't really fair. But more importantly... 2.) Why include a 4-player SPORTS(!) title with only 1 controller? It doesn't even make sense! You get the system for ..., but then you need ... in controllers to fully enjoy it!"
2,THE REAL FACTS,"Ok you people can't just compare the dc with xbox, no way DC is better then PS2, Xbox, GC. Nintendo is making crapy games that suck and some of them are borring.

1,Ripped off,"I ordered the 2 2gb sandisk memory cards and neither one worked, would only let me load 145 pictures on either yet showed I had loads of room left on disk just won't load. then would give me errors...and my camera couldnt even recognize the disks. a big rip off as I was buying it for photo frames for my sons graduation present to load all his college photos on."
5,The right product fopr the right camera,Certain older cameras - older nowadays means a couple of years :-( - handle no more than 2-gig Flash Memory Cards. That's it. For our Canon PowerShot A540 this is the proper product. Writing to and reading from this card is fast and reliable. The price is ridiculously inexpensive. We are well pleased with it and recommend it to anyone using similar cameras.
5,Meet my expectation,"The SanDisk SD card meets my expectation very well. My old Canon SD500 camera takes only SD card, 2GB is the highest I can get. I find it convenient to order online since most brick-and-mortar stores nowadays only carry SDHC cards."
3,Space,"I completely understand that if you buy a 2GB storage medium you never get the entire 2GB of space, but this disk seemed to fill up way beyond even the half way point?Not sure what went wrong there."
5,Flashcards For Digital Camera,I purchased four packs of 2 cards each. They arrived in a timely manner and were exactly the items that I ordered. I am using them in a Kodak Z950 digital camera. At the maximum size setting each card can hold up to 400 pictures. This capability exceeds the battery charge. But having a second charged battery I am able to shoot pictures all day while out. Recommend buying from this seller.
5,They work,If you need SD cards then these will work for you. They are cheaper in price than any where I have seen
4,Great memory card,"These cards work great in my game cameras. Also, that is a very good deal for the price of 2 cards."
5,Works in my camera,"My camera's age means that it will not take a memory card of more than 2 GB. In most stores, the smallest number of GB's you can buy is 4 so I was glad to find an internet source where I can purchase what I need. It seems foolish to discard a perfectly usable camera because of the size of the memory card."
1,price and decription,The decription and price were confusing on both items I bought. They cost twice what I thought they would. The decription said two for a price but ended up costing twice as much.
4,Excelent price and quality,"Good quality, excelent price, but when I ordered them it was supposed that it was a 2-in-1 package instead I got two packages of one Memory"
5,San Disk Flash Memory Cards,"I have and have used this brand for years,....... Never a problem they last & last and at this price You can't Go Wrong."
1,NOT SD Cards,"As a previous reviewer mentioned, I also received the wrong kind -- 2 separately packaged 2GB Sandisk SDHC cards. Do not buy unless you are okay with SDHC (and have SDHC compliant devices.) Back to searching Amazon for ACTUAL SD Cards..."
2,these are sdhc not sd,"I don't know a whole lot about memory cards but I own quite a few. My creative zen player will only accept sd cards. not these high capacity ones. I can't figure out why they would even make a 2gb sdhc. But you have to look close in the product description. it says compatible with sd devices(which it isn't),then under that it says sdhc compatible. This may not affect you if your device takes sdhc but my zens do not and some older cameras don't. Luckily I got my money back for these and bought kingston regular sd cards"
5,Great value!,Flash memory is so much more affordable these days and I prefer to use SanDisk flash cards. Operation is very smooth and no glitches along the way. This was a great value!
2,Watchout for Totally Ridiculous Shipping Charge!,Good price but I put a quantity of 3 - 2 packs in my cart (6 disks) and the shipping charge was $20 !!No Thanks!
1,DONT BUY!!!!,I bought these for my husband to use in his game cameras and all of them were defecting and giving me messages in different languages. I formatted them multiple times and still had not luck with them!
5,These are getting hard to find.,"These low volume chips are to find at local venders. However, some of the older cameras and devices require them.This vender's price and service was exc llent."
5,value,"Work well. good value, bought for an older digital camera, and was satisfied. would buy again if I had to."
5,Haven't used them yet,"This was a great deal. Two cards for a fantastic price. I haven't had a chance to use either one yet, but they were exactly what I ordered for my camera."
4,Does what it is intended to do.,Does what it is supposed to do without problem. Price was right. Good for storing pictures. Amazing how these things have come down in price without quality offsets.
5,great,"Greatdeal! Decided i needed to get myself a few extra adapters for my camera . so i thought about this! Ordered it online, shipped fast and before you know it, it was here and I WAS USING them! Great service and prodct, would recommend"
5,2G SD cards,These 2G cards are getting hard to locate. My game cameras will not recognize anything bigger. The cards came as expected. They arrived earlier than expected. I am totaly pleased.
4,sandisk sd mem cards,The cards are good. Only problem i have is the 18 dollars and over 2 weeks for shipping. ^ sd cards don't weigh over a 1/2 pound. Got hosed real good. Will never use the 1 click checkout again.
3,Not great Not Bad,Some of these players I had forgot all about. Some of the players were role players. They didn't really impressed me when they were playing. But some did some didn't. But either way Roll Tide Roll.
2,"So much potential, so little delivered...","The other criticisms are all valid and I won't add any. My title says it all.BTW, there were 19 reviews for this book at the time I wrote this one. It seemed to me that the overall rating (4+ stars) was not reflected in the reviews and the number of stars assigned. I decided to calculate the rating for myself. Here is what I calculated (stars * count):(5 * 11) + (4 * 1) + (3 * 2) + (1 * 5) = 70/19 = 3.684.This is almost a full star _below_ the overall rating as reported by Amazon. I have noticed before that Amazon's overall rating for materials seemed too high for the reviews, but this is the first time I ran the numbers myself. Seems one must take these things with a pinch of salt..."
2,A Good Comic Book,"Good ideas rarely go far unless they're executed well. In this story, the author has a good premise for a story, but the whole concept would probably have worked far batter as a comic book. Villains with sardonic smiles and grotesque ideas vs. the nebbish anti-Hero learning only too late what lies in store for someone who follows the party line is a caricature of the Orwell original and far more suitable for the ""graphic novel"" world than mainstream literary efforts. This isn't written well enough for a ""summer-reading-at-the-beach"" list, but could easily be re-cast into alternative literature.On the other hand, if you know going into it that it's written like a comic book, you can make it through to the end, and the journey is mildly entertaining. On the other hand, if you feel your reading time should be spent reading works that have been meticulously crafted (AND edited!), then please look elsewhere. You won't find that here."
4,Heart in the right place,"This is a quick and ""fun"" read. Its targets are squarely hit, if a bit tpp obviously so. The adventure story thrills, regardless of its purported relationship to the Orwell classic, and the characters, though not extravagantly developed, are credible. This satirical volume is a true and valuable cautionary morality tale for our age."
4,Vengeance is ours,"There was writing on the 1st page of the book, which was not mentioned on the web site, but the book and shipping time was great!Carolyn"
2,One important detail left out,"This COULD be a fun, simple game, especially for a beginner. However, the cars are only controlled by the directional arrows. The stick does not work. My daughter won't even play it. (...)"
1,Shame! Shame!,"I can't believe they turned it into a badly animated musical. The first one was so nice...you could tell they worked hard on it. From the second one on (I saw them all when my brother had his phase), it all went downhill. This brings shame to the Land Before Time. And Gabriel Damon."
4,Baby loves it,"Erika is 30 months and she wants to watch this one over and over. She likes the songs. She likes the baby T-Rex hatching from the egg. I sometimes put the songs (DVD) only so she could try singing and not watching too much of it. The only bad side of this video is the red eyes T-Rex, its a little scary for a 2 yrs old make sure a parent is there to watch it the 1st time."
1,Embarassing,"This text is the equivalent to the movie ""Triumph of the Will""...that is to say, it is a shameless propaganda piece. Worse, it serves to make fun of and dehumanize a whole country. Over three million non-Jewish Poles were murdered during the war. What about their story? Most Jewish people are ignorant of the plight and suffering of Poles. I think more understanding is what is required in this world, not more hate. This text promotes hate. If I were Jewish I would be very embarassed to be associated with this viewpoint. But if this text has done its job, I would be too full of hate for Poles to care."
4,An Austin Band Ahead of their Prime,"This single lp from Octane is exactly the kind of rock you expect from a great Austin, Texas band. The guitar player, David Beeson, is phenomenal. His driving licks on ""All By Myself"" will force you to drive faster if you listen to it in the car. If you miss great bands like AC/DC and Kix, you should definetly invest the small amount of money it costs for this disc. Also, be on the look out for a new CD from this band, I have heard a new song of the album and its great."
4,Very good fountain pen,"It is a big plastic pen. The Vista Demo Clear is practical that you can tell how much ink left. I used it with the Z24 safari converter with Parker Quink ink. The Extra Fine nib is wider than fine, not extra fine. The width of it is mainly depends on the paper you use and the speed you write. In brief, it is a very good fountain pen."
2,Disappointing point,"I just received this pen and was pleased that it was immediately usable, as there was an enclosed cartridge. However, I was strongly disappointed that this pen, advertised as having an extra-fine nib, actually wrote a thicker line than most of my fine-nib pens. I would categorize it as being closer to a medium. So if you are considering this pen for accounting or artistic work, you should think twice or look elsewhere for your needs."
3,Dries out quickly,"When used with this pen, the ink dries out within 30 seconds of the pen being left uncapped and also seems to dry out even when it is capped. It's extremely hard to get it flowing again. This will probably be the last time I purchase an extra fine Lamy nib."
1,This ain't the Movie with Jack Hawkins !,"Returned this to amazonia after they initially mis-listed this as the 1950s cinemascope epic staring Jack Hawkins... plus a somwhat porky if zoftig Joan Collins, and James Robertson Justice. Disappointing that only AMC seems to have access to the restored widescreen version and such is not yet released on DVD."
2,boring,"The story drags on and on. It jumps around in time, but doesn't really make you any more interested in the story. The action isn't all that great either. I stopped watching after the 3rd episode. What a waste of time."
2,Boring,The anime is very long and boring and confusing. I've had 2 chances to watch this series and each time I've watched about 10 minutesof it and ended up stopping it because I didn't know what was going on.
2,Too slow and no proper ending but the action is cool when it happens,Starts off too slow and does a lot of abstract scenery shots that begin to get a little aggravating. Then when the story finally pics up after introducing too many characters too fast it does get a lot better and the fights scenes are really cool then it ends with no closure and much like trinity blood no final battle the whole series builds up to
1,Simply awful!,"Horrible! Unwatchable. I wanted to like this series and I sat in my seat as long as I could but it was unbearable!Rent this if you like to see characters not moving any part of their bodies except their lips. It's very well drawn but there's no movement.I noticed a pattern:1. Characters sit or kneel, talking or thinking.2. A bad guy smiles and giggles.3. Someone looks very surprised.4. Repeat 1-3.Stick with ""Samurai Champloo"", ""Sword of the Stranger"" and ""Moribito"" for great colors, animation, character development and ACTION!"
3,Never finishes,"Awesome premise, doesn't exactly come full circle. It is not a story of two samurai and their battles, but more of a story of HOW two samurai's become rivals. The ending will not satisfy the basic the story telling rhetoric, and leaves the story open and not quiet done. It seems like the anime was an half baked idea that was not thought through."
3,Decent but could have been better,"I was very excited for this DVD to come out. When it came out on Blu ray I was elated. However this is definetly one of those anime series that is a better rental than a owner title. The ending leaves you hanging and there is not enough action to keep anime junkies satisfied. Overall it is a great series, but it really needs a second season to make all the loose ends come together."
2,lame,"me and my girlfriend usually cant wait to watch anime series when we buy them, but with this one we watched one episdoe and there it just sat. we finally finished up the other episodes but i only made it thru the first 3 and then i went to bed."
