2,You get what you pay for,"This recording just doesn't achieve the fullness and cohesive complexity of two works that are extremely challenging, although in completely different ways. Both performances sound rote and oddly passionless. The Nashville Symphony certainly gets an 'A' for effort, but it has a way to go before it can be accepted as one of the premier orchestras in the country. Look elsewhere for your recordings of Ives' 2nd and the Browning Overture."
3,Lionel,"Not at all what I expected.I found the music rich and full of sub melodies and thematic excursions. Unfortunately, I did not find a discernable transitional approach between movements.Not as expressive as I expected. Perhaps the term explosive is better."
5,Good Ives Recording,"I was raised on movie soundtracks and scores from the likes of Bernard Herrmann, Dimitri Tiomkin, Alex North and others. As we have lost many of these composers and music they may have left us through the years, I have been slowly looking at 20th century composers from the ""classical"" arena to fill that void for my listening pleasure. I have discovered Charles Ives and Morton Gould after reading up further on Aaron Copland and his foray into many diverse areas of musical composition. One thing leads to another. Ives' Symphony No. 2 seems to have come up very frequently. It certainly doesn't have the melodic quality of early Copland yet it does seem to have roots resulting in American musical motifs very strangely orchestrated resulting in some twisted profoundness. What attracts me is how the music almost seems as if it were composed for film. The music is growing on me and the fact that the technical qualities of the recording are so superb it makes the recording more appealing."
3,Amusingly flawed,"Considering her reputation as a perfectionist, I'm surprised that Streisand let the many mistakes in this film get past her. Fans who have the soundtrack will catch how Streisand messes up the lyrics in the finale, but presses on anyway. In the scene where she wrestles in the mud with Kris (in her expensive white outfit), she has mud on the back of her outfit before they even get down in the dirt. Jon Peters is shown in the background of one of the concert scenes. And the ""concert tour"" takes place almost entirely on the same stage - at least she changed outfits a few times.All in all, I still enjoy this movie once in a while. It reminds me of how over-the-top the 1970's were."
1,About as much fun as a...........,"... I tried to like it , I really did, but just can't. Miss Streisand is so full of herself from shot to shot she makes me sick. How can anyone love themselves so much? I saw it in the theater years ago and decided I would try it again. Sorry I just can't make it through this film ...The musical numbers are suppose to be rock n'roll? HA HA HA! .. On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it -100! Get Funny Girl if you must see Streisand at her best! Ciao!"
5,"Cuando lo tendremos?, Roberto desde Paris.","Ha sido anunciado en varias oportunidades como pronta salida comercial, esperamos y esperamos.... y seguimos sin novedades, hasta cuando sera la espera para tener este maravilloso filme en casa?????, gracias!!!!."
2,"DATED, DATED, DATED","I remembered really liking this film many years ago, so I bought it. But it was so dated, I couldn't wait 'till it was over. Also I think some of the scenes were added or changed. At least, that's the way I remembered it. The music was awful, especially the Kris Kristoferson music, if you could call it that. Most of the time he was too drunk to sing. And the tales of his down hill collapse was nothng short of boring. Barbra's songs were fair. Evergreen is still remembered as a nice ballad, and Barbra did sing one OK rock tune. But most of her stuff was also boring. The two stars instead on one is for the song Evergreen, not the film."
1,DVD - A Star is Born,This was a difficult title for me to find with Streisand and Kristofferson. This item was in-stock and shipped quickly. Quality is as good as any other DVD I have purchased.
5,My Mother Watched it and Loved it Again,Never seen it. But I will be sure to. So thank you Hollywood for teaching us about how our dreams can come true.
3,Not quite as good as I remembered,"I bought this for the music. I never bought a CD to replace my vinyl record of this, so it had been a long time since I listened to the music. Re-hearing and seeing Streisand perform ""Evergreen"" is a treat, as is her performance of ""Woman in the Moon"" - but the rest of the music was vaguely boring and even a bit irritating at times. To do over again, I would have been better off downloading the MP3's of the two songs I liked. If you really want to spend over two hours watching ""A Star is Born"" I would recommend getting the Judy Garland 1954 musical - lots of great songs and definitely better acting."
4,A Star is Born for the 70's Generation!,"The Classic James Mason and Judy Garland version of ""A Star Is Born will never be topped. And I don't believe that they tried to in 1976. A Star is Born in 1976 was an incredibly popular movie, and although it was shunned ,and skewered by the critics, it played in theatres for 6 months. So in the 21st Century you have to have the wisdom of watching this movie through a 1970's lens. I ENJOY watching a rather young Barbra Streisand rocking out on the Finale-Watch Closely Now."
3,Not as I expected,"This movie was a dissapointment.Streisand didnt prove to be a good singer in the rock genra but her acting is really good.She is better off singing pop or broadway songs.This movie is only worth to watch for the song ""Evergreen""."
5,A STAR IS BORN,"GREAT MOVIE,GREAT VOICE,GREAT LIVE PERFORMANCES THAT TODAYS SINGERS CANNOT DO.BARBRA IS ONCE AGAIN AT BEST HERE!!!LOVE THE ADDITIONAL COMMENTARY."
5,One of my ALL-TIME favorites!,"Ok...I'm a sap for a love story. I saw this in the theaters 5X (on TV several more) and bought the original LP then everything I could find on it music-wise. Needless to say, I LOVED IT!Now that I have a DVD player, I want the DVD...and will probably wear it out. No, I don't particularly care for Kris K's singing (love his song writing), but he's not a bad (SEXY) actor. I was at the age, movie-wise, that I saw him as drop dead gorgeous! I had occasion to work FARM AID with him years later and found out he's a nice man, too.Barbra is...well what can I say? She was superb! ""Evergreen"" is a classic. I loved the other songs, as well, but this was my favorite with ""Lost Inside of You"" being my second favorite. Her acting was great and I thought they made a great movie couple.OK... so I'm an incurable romantic, but I'm jumping at the chance to get this on DVD. If you love a love story, you'll love this!"
2,Stick with the 1937 or 1954 versions,"Poor Barbra.The best part of the DVD is her comments; they are beyond over-the-top to show how her sense of reality is gone. Yes, she is literate when talking about design and lighting and casting; but from her tone you would think she made a film to challenge Ingmar Bergman.Instead this is a film so bad and so banal; she is basically playing herself--an unsympathetic woman who can sing her a** off. At no point do we know why she and Kris fall in love with each other. At no point does she seem at all sympathetic or even grateful for her success.And why doesn't Kris get to write and sing his own songs???"
1,A really bad remake!,I'm a big Barbra Streisand fan but this movie remains such a bad movie remake of the original two. It was a disappointment in 1976 and remains one today. The writing is truely awful. A movie to avoid--rent the 1954 version instead. That version remains one of the best movie musicals of all times.
5,A star is born 1976,"This was a great remake the one in 1937 was very good too, I can not wait 'till it comes out on dvd. I loved Kris & Barb I have seen all three movies and like this one best. Good god I hope they don't make one with J-lo it will be as bad as the Judy Garland one! They would only give me five stars I would give it 10 stars! A must see for folks who like Kris I also like Alice doesn't live here anymore."
1,Not for me,"Maybe this match-up worked in the seventies, or whenever this won best picture, but I found Kriss Krisofferson and Barbara Streisand to be bland and boring. The songs were horrendous and the storyline stilted. The dialogue was absolutely moronic. Maybe the film is saved in it's third act, but I wouldn't know because I stopped watching somewhere after the midpoint."
1,Directed by a high school kid,"This movie is terrible. It is one of the most poorly directed films ever made. It looks as if it had been directed by a high school student. Oh no, here comes a closeup on Barbra I bet. Sure enough, there's the closeup on Barbra. The directing is embarrassingly horrid. This trash gives chick flicks a bad name."
3,Sad Movie,"This is one depressing movie! It's good, but if you're looking for something to pick you up and leaving you feeling good, it's not the one. Dark, depressing, but good acting."
3,Predictable,Movie is good but sooo predictable. Bonus part Streisand talks through the whole movie instead of specific parts...why watch both.
2,Not Fine Wine,"This movie has not aged well at all. I never felt comfortable with Barbra Streisand in this role. After 20 years, its only worse. She should have never tried to portray a rising rock star. And that tight permed hair, yikes! Kristofferson would never have looked at her twice in real life."
4,A Star Is Stupid,"I remember when this came out in the late 70s, it seemed like an alright movie then, I even remember Elvis was suppose to play the supporting role. After watching it again in 2011, I now remember how wrong the 70s were and why we are so screwed up now. This movie is a symbolic time capsual. This would have been a degrade for Elvis, apparently he degraded on his own. This movie is an example of what we no longer tolerate because we just don't care anymore. And Gary Busey still had a brain in this one."
4,old time favorite of mine,"i always loved this movie, no one can compare singing to b. streistand..she is incredible, and i have always been a fan of kri. love the two together"
3,"Catch the musical numbers, fast forward thru the rest","Book Bin's beautiful description of the ""Evergreen"" recording studio scene is dead on, except for one major error; this scene WAS infact recorded live.... no lip-synching here. There is no bigger Streisand fan than I, but I must agree...this movie is just a mess. I suspect the problem lies in the editing. It's common knowledge that hundreds of hours are shot and then scaled down to make a 2 hour movie flow and make sense; it fails miserably. You can't blame Barbra for the silly looking era, because as many here mentioned, this was the way of the funky and oh-so-tacky 70's, then considered chic` and glamorous. The acting isn't bad, but it's hardly Oscar callibre either. Hopefully the DVD will improve this mess or at least explain a few things."
1,It should have been called A Star Is Still-Born,"Or A Star Is Boring.Being a fan of the three previous versions (Before the Gaynor version ,there was a film called ""What Price Hollywood"" that contained many of the elements that we think of as A Star Is Born), as well as a fan of Striesand's I went to the film's premire in NYC back in 76 hoping to be blown away .Instead was just appalled at how uninvolving this turkey was.On the other hand I've enjoyed the soundtrack album over the years, so I tried to watch the film again recently.Lowered expectations didn't help.Now it's not only boring but dated as well.If they really wanted to update the story for the 70's Barbra should have played the Norman Maine role.I think this film ties with Dino DeLaurentis' big monkey movie as the worst remake ever.Even the musical remake of Lost Horizon looks good by comparison"
1,My error,"I thought I was buying the album and not the download, I have tried in vain multiple times to reach someone , anyone to correct MY error. But Amazon is impossible to get on the phone . Hopefully someone will contact me now."
4,I've never seen Streisand perform this good,I just loved the movie even thought it and old one i like it very much
5,Love Barbra Streisand,"The story line is great, and so is the music.If you like Barbra, you should enjoy this.It really shows her range in music."
3,Oh come on....it's not THAT bad,"It seems to me as though most of the reviewers are anti-Barbra rather than against this movie. I've read reviews that criticize the wardrobe, the songs.... sorry to point this out, but the clothing and hairstyles WERE in style when the movie was made. As another review pointed out, this was the era of Carly Simon, James Taylor, etc., so to say that Esther's songs wouldn't have been accepted by a ""stoned-out"" crowd is not necessarily true.It's completely camp, but still fun to watch. I wish Kristofferson would've done a better job singing, but I thought he was effective portraying a man out of control. Like Esther, I was repelled by his actions but felt I could like the person. In that respect, he's spot-on. The film has decidedly too many close-ups of Barbra, which can be annoying, but I recommend it to anyone who wants a little cheese with their wine."
1,Box Office Bonanza-Artistic DUD,"Barbra's biggest film, moneywise, is also probably her worst film to date. Self-concious and strained, it's just difficult sitting through it all. Kristofferson comes off the best. Barbra, trying to bring to the screen a youthful/contemporary character, fails miserably. A couple of nice songs, but the whole affair is, sad to say, a waste of time for all involved."
1,Hilariously bad,"Caught this again on cable (I saw it originally in 1976). It has not aged well, unsurprisingly. Now it's a prime piece of cheesy 70's camp. This is not the movie to bring any fence-sitters over to La Streisand's camp; this is easily her most unbearable performance."
1,A Need for Therapy is Born,Oh. My. God. What a horrible movie. How this ever got made I write off to the 70s and Streisand's ego.
3,Cher should have done it!,"As much as I enjoy Barbra and the film, in all honesty I think that Cher would have done a better job. It is her genre. Streisand is great with her songs, but she just can't get rocky and rough enough for this role. The MANY Barbra fans plus a few more will love it (as I do). But again to be honest... Cher would have done it better!"
5,STILL WAITING!!!!!! & WAITING!!!!! & WAITING!!!!!!,This is when I truly fell in love with Barbara! She finally showed us all that she wasn't always all about bee hive hair doo's and broadway. SHE ROCKS!
1,Good but rather...,Hi. I have read this book in the last 2 weeks. I think you are an inspiring writer and think that you will be the next shaksphere... when's the sequel to this coming out? i can't wait.. and thanks for keeping me company with this book...
4,This Book Rocks!,"The author knows his stuff and presents it in a clear, logical manner. He's a regular cop, not some champion marksman that names all sorts of techniques after himself, like the ""Suarez Squat Shot"", like some other shooting authors do."
1,Dated material from an ex con,"Suarez not only did jail time for worker's compensation fraud, but claimed on the 700 club that he was on his way to shoot his fellow officers in their sleep when God appeared to him and talked him out of it.Get the magpul pistol DVDs insteadhttp://www.amazon.com/Magpul-Art-Dynamic-Handgun-DVD/dp/B00373PEVWOr Kyle Lamb's bookhttp://www.amazon.com/Fight-Warriors-Guide-Combat-Pistol/dp/0615428363/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1357438155&sr;=8-2&keywords;=green+eyes+black+rifles"
2,What I Learned About Shooting At The Police Academy,"The contents of this book are largely lifted from Police training manuals, and are not suited for the average citizen, unless you happen to be in a militia(...). I can't imagine why ordinary gun-enthusiasts would be interested in combat with fellow citizens, clearing and entering houses with hostile foes, and all the other techniques on offer here. Suarez makes a big deal about how he is a decorated officer, but no police officer worth their salt would put out books teaching citizens to be members of a tactical SWAT team.The author obviously isn't a police officer in good standing anymore because no commanding officer would permit someone to profit off the tactics presented here.If you are a gun-enthusiast, you would be better off buying something by John Farnam or Andy Stanford. Their books are written for citizen gun owners, and they don't teach how to indiscriminately kill people."
4,Cute but a little floppy.,"This is a cute little basket. The only drawback is how it attaches to the handle bars. It uses two strips of plastic with slots for a notch. You slip the plastic strip through the basket and loop it over the handle bar. The notch has a tendency to come out of the slot and the basket kind of flops forwards on the handlebars. But, for a little girl that isn't going to ride a tricycle for long, it's good enough just not totally great. It also comes with a matching bell which is better constructed and has a more solid attachment. Something that can be transferred to another bike when it's time for a 2 wheeler."
3,Ok--not great.,"The basket itself is fine and small enough to fit comfortably on my daughter's tricycle. However, the plastic ties that came with it are not very useful. We used our own plastic ties--smaller ones that fit tighter and without getting in the way of the handlebars. Once we used our own ties, it fit fine. It was cheap enough that we didn't mind having to be resourceful."
2,Bad smelling plastic,It's nice that this basket is cheap and cute but the plastic smells terrible with a rotten fishy oder. Washing it helps some but only temporarily. The worst part is the bad fishy smell transferred to the stuffed animals that my daughter put in the basket. Avoid the chemical exposure and spend your money on something else.
4,Bycicle or Scooter Basket,"It's to soon to tell, we just put it on the scooter in April 2010. Bought it April 1, 2010. Seems sturdy enough for now, we'll see how it holds up over the summer being outside in the heat."
4,Disney Princess Basket,This is a cute little basket for the perfect little princess. I got one and then I had to get another one for my little princesses.
3,Cute but hard to put on,This basket is so cute but it took 3 people and several tries to get it on my daughter's tricycle
5,Princess basket,My daughter loved this basket. It fits just fine on her small 12 inch bike. I just had to take the plastic padding off the bicycle to get the basket straps to attach. No problem. We have had this for over a year now and it is still in awesome shape. Nothing broken or falling apart!
1,Not what I expected,"First, to use this product ""right side up"", the configuration is like sitting on a soft dinner plate (with the edges up) -not my idea of comfort for a long row [ I tried this on a 10,000 meter row and found it very uncomfortable--a small folded fleece blanket works better than this]. Second, the ""gel"" pads aren't gel, they're bags of some kind of powder--not the same feel at all [I took mine apart to see what modifications to it or parts of it I could use for something else]; it still allows more pressure on the ""sit"" bones than I find comfortable--the seat pad concept2 sells as an accessory is more comfortable than this product."
3,Nice WALL BANNER but not as described.,This flag is NOT two-sided as listed in description. It also is strictly a wall banner and does not have a slot for sliding a house pole through for vertical hanging outside a house. It is sewn as described and is actually a very nice wall hanging/banner. It just is not what you are looking for if you desire a two-sided flag to hang from a horizontal pole outside.Update: Since the review was first posted the description has been updated and now more accurately reflects what the item is.I am still returning it since it does not meet my needs.
2,they used to be a lot better...,"when listening to ""Some of Us"" i can't help but feel a profound sense of sadness and nostalgia. Primitive Reason, with the music of their first 2 albums (""Alternative Prison"" and ""Tips & Shortcuts"", only available in Portugal i think), had a really strong influence in my 'teenage years'. they once were one of the best Portuguese bands, now i don't know if i can still call them 'portuguese' anymore.along with drastic changes in the band's line up came (predictable?) changes in their music...for worse, in my opinion. they totally lost that appeal, that seductiveness of their early years.""Some of Us"" lacks the innovative ability, originality and raw power of their first albums...a truly disappointing record! they should consider the possibility of changing their name...they quit being Primitive Reason with this album."
1,Foxfire 22 pocket vest,"Good features include many pockets.Bad feature is the poor quality of the vest lining. As a result, the two pockets where I carried car keys developed holes after a couple of weeks.Avoid this product if you intend to carry keys in the pockets."
5,Fantastic,"Great vest for fishing, camera equipment or as the total man purse! Great quality. Will order two in the future."
3,Phase IV,"When an unusual event takes place, thousands of ants are seen to build unusual ant hill structures. A modern science facility watching them is invaded and a Praying Mantis is set upon them, but the ants are far more clever than realized. The entire fate of man will in fact lie with the ants. This movie was so unusual that I have never forgotten it. It had almost a surreal feel to it. Most fans of intellectual SciFi movies should enjoy it, but even non-fans will probably find it interesting. This is a bare bones DVD with no extras at all. It is a clean copy but it seems to me that Legend Studios that released it may have cut a brief nudity scene at the end. Other than that it seems like the original release. Ashame the vendors are so pricey or I wouldn't mind having a copy. I will wait for lower prices, and until then I will just rent it. If you enjoyed this catch ""Logan's Run"" and ""Soylent Green"".CA Luster"
1,one of the most boring movies I have ever seen!,"First off alot of great reviews for this snoozefest, and alot of people commenting on being stoned while watching this, well I guess you would have to be to enjoy it on any level. Some good photography doesnt compensate for card board characters, stupid dialogue, completely unsuspensful drivel that was I must admit agonizing to sit through. I would rather be bitten by ants than watch this lame movie again."
3,Macro Cinematography of Insects,"The film was a Nature/Horror genre (a la Godzilla, Them, The Mysterious Island, Food, of the Gods) about scientist that are studying an Ant colony, when their presence upsets their territorial boundary, so they aggressively eradicate the new threat.The scientists use poison to protect themselves, which is then adapted into the ant kingdom, leaving the desperate scientists at wits end."
3,The ants fight back,"This is a great old 70's B ant movie. I like it because the ants fight back after the humans provoke them. It's fun watching the human Vs. Ant strategies. Has some pacing problems, but is a good B movie to watch on a Sunday afternoon."
4,Brilliant SciFi,"This is one of those thinking SciFi movies that has you in discussions with other open minded people. I saw it at the theater when it was first released. I was amazed at how well the effects were done for the time and the great acting. When scientist study ants and the effects of chemicals on them things take a twist they don't anticipate. The story will have you going Wow! at the end. What you think is a battle may only be a lesson of survival. I believe Nietzsche said, ""That which doesn't kill you, makes you stronger"". This movie will make you stronger."
4,great old film,i never saw it intill my boyfriend said to watch it. it was a little slow but the idea of ants being smarter than us great.
2,Not up to this author's standard,"Normally I would not give a bad review to an author that is usually so terrific, but some scalpers, (yes, you know who you are) are asking ridiculous amounts of money for this book! I got an interlibrary loan for the book and I was so glad I did. I was not impressed with the hero at all and I found it to be not near as enjoyable as her other books. I had came close to spending twice what it originally cost until I remembered my library option. Now, the cost has skyrocketed even more. Don't spend the extra money, ladies. Although I liked the heroine, I got half way through the book and gave up. Her other books however, are fabulous."
1,Couldn't Finish This Movie,"I tried for three consecutive nights to make it through this movie and couldn't do it. As the Amazon reviewer noted, it is hard to tell the characters apart, and this adds confusion to the boredom and repulsion. The plot didn't capture me at all, and the so-called sensational action was very predictable and campy. I guess if you're into seeing a woman have sex with a dog, and other defilements, this might be of interest to you.I love all types of obscure stuff out of Japan, but this falls way short. I advise that you rent before you buy as you may be disappointed by this even if it sounds like it might be in one of your collection genres."
2,Cute ending for Yakuza bore-fest,"Don't get me wrong, I really like Miike and would recommend Audition or Visitor Q any time but I fell asleep about halfway through this. I've probably watched too many of these ""es muy macho"" Yakuza films over the last year which has made me very sensitive to the cliche's of this genre. There are two good scenes in this movie that take place in the final 10 minutes, the car bomb and the destruction of the earth but otherwise you would do better to buy a Beat Takeshi film."
2,Wannabe Takeshi Kitano,"I thought Takashi Miike was the bomb after watching AUDITION and FUDOH. However, this effort seemed like regurgitated Tarantino and parody of his better works. Kitano seems like a strong influence but Miike lacks the poetic filmaking style in such works as SONATINE, FIREWORKS. Dead or Alive was a big disappointment."
2,"Tryed to Flush it, but It still Stinks","You know you're in trouble when a film starts off with a fast paced, disjointed montage equivilent to a bad music video, complete with horribly dull, not-so-heavy metal guitar wanking and noodling. Set this luke warm music to random images of the 'ol ultra violence and a little ""T &A;"" thrown in for good measure. Yawn. This over hyped [stuff] will have you hitt'n the fast frwd button after the first 6 minutes to get to all those crazy, outta this world fight scenes that you keep reading about, but the pay off just never fully comes. Trust me, you've seen all the fast cutt gun shoot outs a millon times over if you're into this genere.What you do get with ""Dead or Alive""i s a few really great, yet quick, random, taboo""shock"" scenes that Takashi Miike is known for, but their inclusion in the film feels a little forced. Unless you are a hardcore fan of this type of action film mediocrity, save yo money and rent this first."
2,Overrated,"I can't believe I wasted a free Blockbuster movie rental coupon on this P.O.S. The 2 stars is for the cool beginning, what happens to the cops family, and the ending. Everything in between isn't that great. Very little dialogue, and poor character building. Rent/buy it if you don't care about dialogue, and whether or not the good/bad guys die or not.This would've been a lot better if it were a short film of the ""highlights""."
4,"""oh shxt""","I just finished watching the movie and I must say that I haven't had a movie that actually made me say, ""oh shxt"" outloud so many times by myself. Although, I must say it's probably my least favorite Miike movie I've seen so far, it definately was a great movie. It does get rather slow, but that does make you appreciate the parts that jump out at you a lot more. Loved the ending. lol."
4,A DVD zone APOCALYPSE WOW !,"Takashi Miike belongs to this new wave of Japanese directors who appeared in the mid-nineties. Hysterical editings, almost unbearable scenes of torture and sexual perversions, heroes who seem to have jumped out of a comic strip are the main trademarks of the cinema of these directors.Now are they worth the time you'll spend watching their movies ? In the case of DEAD OR ALIVE, the answer is definitively YES. The two main actors, Riki Takeuchi and Sho Aikawa, are surprisingly good and the ten first and last minutes of DEAD OR ALIVE proove that Takashi Miike is a director deserving an international recognition. Anyway, it has given me the wish to see other films of Miike.The KINO DVD offers as extra bonus a 10 minutes interview with the director who's as crazy as his movies and a bunch of trailers of japanese movies. Sound and images average, no more."
4,out of control,"Dead or Alive is a truly strange satire of the Japanese gangsta' film genre, with MANY surprises. Not for the faint of stomach, but also not to be taken seriously, this film has one of the most fitting Japanese film endings of all time."
4,artsy b-grade yakuza flick,"This movie is worth watching. It is. It will not be entirely pleasant, it will not make very much sense, it will leave you debating the merits of vomiting, screaming, or laughing, and questioning whether any of these is a sane response to the montage of the grotesque you just witnissed. Like a car crash, though, you can't turn away. If pure emotional effect is what you want, if confusion and mild psychosis is your ideal net benifit from watching a film, you can't go wrong with this. Takashi Miike makes good on the tradition of artsy, transgressive grade-b movies in a way that would warm the fifty-foot woman's heart."
3,Ripstop durable kite. Everything you need is in the box.,"The kite is made of ripstop fabric which is very durable. Compared to other kites, there is no frame which makes it much easier to store and very portable. It even comes with a similar ripstop pouch bag. My kid wants a rainbow colored kite because our old almost broken kite is made of such colors, so this is just the right one for him.I am surprised that a 120-foot string is included. I thought I would have to switch the string from the old one, now I don't have too. Assembly is a no-brainer as you just have to attached the quicklip at the end of the string to the kite.Cons:- Needs stronger wind to fly. Not the easiest kite to fly. It dives down at times for no apparent reason.- The bag is just enough for the folded kite and will not fit the string and spool inside it."
4,Nice kite for little money,This little kite was most pleasing. Durable with nothing to break and with a good wind this kite flies solidly. All for under $10. This is a great choice.
5,The Food Lover's Guide to France,"I found this book in Paris, translated into French, and so was very surprised after a few weeks of using it to finally notice that it was not written by a native Parisian. Ms. Wells makes very detailed comments about each restaurant's menu, service, as well as ambiance and history. The write-ups of the restaurants and other food places are interspersed with brief articles on French lifestyle, cheeses, wines, customs, and other foodie points of interest that I wouldn't have thought to look up but which I found extremely interesting. I had bought it simply as an aid to finding decent food but as it turns out, The Food Lover's Guide is also a wonderful mini-guide through French life and history."
5,"good book, has ruined a lot of good places, though","PW knows her stuff. I bought this after going to PAris several dozen times and found that most of what I liked she had recomended, as well as many many places that I didn't know.The only problem was that every where I went, even to places I had never seen a tourist in, were now full of tourists with her book on the table, ordering the exact meal she had recomended.a truly powerful pen"
2,Many other good places,Not so sure she is fair about who she rates highly. I went to a few places that were way below average. I do like like some of her sidebars.
3,Neat audiobook,"This book was okay, well performed, but after I got it, I realized it was not what I was looking for. It is more of a performance, acted out on stage in front of a live audience. I believe that before ordering this book, I read somewhere that it was performed live, but I guess I didn't know what to expect. I would not order another book by this author, only because I did not like the live perfformance."
4,Andrea Bocelli: Verdi,"I enjoyed the recording. Andrea works hard, and his beautiful voice is always distinctive. His interpretations of classic Verdi pieces really reveal nothing new, but his voice itself yields a freshness that is often enchanting, always listenable. I love the control and coloring he can exhibit throughout his entire range, which is remarkable. He is reverential to Verdi, never interpolating what the Master didn't request. Mehta's sure hand is evident here; the conductor does not allow liberties but appreciates Andrea's strengths and lets them shine through."
3,Bocelli not so luminous on this CD,"Don't get me wrong. I absolutely LOVE Andrea Bocelli. However, this CD works him very hard at times and thus doesn't give me the opportunity to enjoy him singing these pieces like I did when he sang his ""Sacred Arias."" I found many surprises here simply because I loved Bocelli (taking a cue from the Editorial Review) and I appreciate those surprises (such as that kick-[butt] high D on ""Possente Amore""), but really I'd rather much listen to ""Romanza,"" ""Sogno"" or ""Sacred Arias"" than workout pieces like this. Sorry!"
5,One of the best!,"While Pavarotti and some other tenors may be more famous, I much prefer Andrea Bocelli. His singing comes from deep within his soul and very being. It touches the spirit and stirs me to feel deeply all the emotions one can in any sense feel in listening to moving music. Perfectionism may be what some listeners want. Music, I feel, should have depth and meaning which is what Mr. Bocelli provides not minimally, but amply."
2,I can't hear it,"I thought that if I heard Bocelli away from the Nightmare Woman, Sarah Brightman, I might hear something I liked. I did. Verdi. But not this performance. Face it: This man cannot sing opera. I'm sorry he's blind. I'm glad he is popularising classical music, but somebody should tall him he has no voice for this. There are hundreds of wonderful, starving tenors who could use a tiny bit of this publicity. I have heard some of them passing the hat for half-pound coins in the Covent Garden marketplace. Charlotte Church is a novelty also, but she can sing. Zubin Mehta should be ashamed of himself for jumping on Mr. Bocelli's gravy train. Mr. Bocelli should limit himself to the ""Love Theme from the Godfather,"" or to singing with Ms. Brightman, next to who he sounds ggod."
1,I really tried,"I tried to give him a chance, but there is no way this guy can sing Verdi. First he lacks the powerfull voice for Verdi. His high notes are absolutelly white and shrill, his interpretation is dubious at best and his technique is underaverage. You hear better singing in most music schools, and it is a pity what passes for professional opera singing nowadays.As a Verdi tenor, I think he should stick to ""con te partiro"". At least in popular music we don't form expectations for the singing that he can't possibly begin to fullfill.Listen to Franco Corelli or Mario del Monaco in the same repertoire!"
4,Bocelli Shines,"Do you want to know why Bocelli isn't one of the Three Tenors? He's not quite in their class. However, I could not agree less with the people who say that he's not you to most peoples tastes, because he's anything but tasteful. His arias are great. He does not quite have a grasp on some pieces that others have, unfortunately. ""Di quella pira"" was not nearly dramatic enough, nor was ""Ah, is, ben mio"" sad enough. I could not picture him playing the part of Manrico, the Duke, or Radames in a full-scale opera performance, but in some arias he is great- for instance, ""Di tu se fedele"" or ""Ella mi fu rapita."" In all, I think that he is a great singer and a hero for doing so much while blind. I enjoyed this cd a lot."
3,Andrea Bocelli: Verdi,"I believe I own and love every Bocelli cd available. However, I find ""Verdi"" (his latest release) to be the most difficult for me to listen to. I almost wonder if some of Verdi's compositions are the right choice for Bocelli's voice. I think the cd will grow on me, but this is my knee-jerk reaction."
1,Not a Verdi singer,I believe Verdi's music requires a bigger voice that Bocelli's. He is a good pop singer and should keep singing pop.
2,I can't hear it,"I thought that if I heard Bocelli away from the Nightmare Woman, Sarah Brightman, I might hear something I liked. I did. Verdi. But not this performance. Face it: This man cannot sing opera. I'm sorry he's blind. I'm glad he is popularising classical music, but somebody should tall him he has no voice for this. There are hundreds of wonderful, starving tenors who could use a tiny bit of this publicity. I have heard some of them passing the hat for half-pound coins in the Covent Garden marketplace. Charlotte Church is a novelty also, but she can sing. Zubin Mehta should be ashamed of himself for jumping on Mr. Bocelli's gravy train. Mr. Bocelli should limit himself to the ""Love Theme from the Godfather,"" or to singing with Ms. Brightman, next to whom he sounds good."
2,Bad versions of exquisite arias,"Andrea Bocelli possesses a beautiful, dark voice but, sorry to say this, I don't consider him a tenor. This collection is the clearest proof of that. For common listeners he is ideal but for any experienced opera listener he has a rather flat, ordinary voice. If one compares his singing in these arias with the versions that Bergonzi, Bjorling, Domingo, Carreras, Kraus have given us, he'll at once realise the difference."
5,The public speaks,"My wife turned me on to Sr. Bocelli the first time she'd ever heard him. She discovered him through his pop recordings. I'd always been an opera fan, so I was surprised that his cd appealed to me. And his voice and range have only improved. This is quite evident in his newest release, Verdi's arias. He sings each aria as it was written, and meant to be sung...with beauty and passion. He feels each word he sings, and conveys that feeling to the listener. From the quiet beauty of ""Ah se, ben mio"" to his rousing rendition of ""Celest Aida"". How many opera singers do you here drop an entire octave from one phrase to the next, as Sr. Bocelli does in ""Io la vidi e il suo sorriso"" with exquisite perfection? If you want to hear opera sung by someone who loves it as much as the person who composed it, this is the cd for you. Run, don't walk to your nearest record store and pick it up. You won't regret it."
1,Is there an Italian word for Chutzpah?,"It's a shame that many people will come away from this experience thinking that this is the way legitimate operatic tenors sound. I must say that my reaction was stunned disbelief that this was actually being offered to the public as a serious contender amongst the vast array of truly gifted Verdian interpreters. That roster is long, distinguished and well known (or so I thought), and nothing is to be gained by listing it here, except to say that Mr.Bocelli certainly does not belong in that august company. The painful truth is that this is a tiny, reedy and weepy-sounding instrument. That he can muster a certain amplified heft in his upper register doesn't come close to salvaging this vocal and artistic disaster. The fact that this will probably be a commercial success is depressing, but rest assured that Verdi will survive even this ignominy."
4,Enjoyable Listening,"Bocelli doesn't have what I consider to be a top tenor voice. What he has is a personal flavor about his voice that shows he enjoys singing. With Verdi tunes it is hard to miss and he has selected some of the favorites. It keeps him in the ""pop"" circuit without taxing power or notes. For a stroll in the park with your trusty disk player, most enjoyable. For home listening by the fireplace and on a built-in player, he does not jead the list."
3,Nice voice,"Bocelli has a nice voice for pop music, art songs, and maybe sacred light music, but Verdi is too much for his vocal ability."
1,Talent or Marketing,"The marketing suits will tell you Bocelli is the greatest tenor ever - certainly he's sold more than the Three Tenors combined. If you love his story - overcoming a physical challenge - then that's great for you - I will politely disagree with the Marketing Department about the quality of his artistry. If you want a great story and a great voice, check out Thomas Quasthoff, the talented bass-baritone. He doesnt have anywhere near the number of marketing suits that Bocelli has AND he has an inspiring story of overcoming physical challenge. OR of course you could ignore the marketeers and try a new tack and just buy music by talented musicians regardless of their personal story (what a concept)"
3,Verdi,"Verdi is my least favorite album by Andrea Bocelli. I am not sorry I bought Verdi, because he does a superb job in this Opera. His voice is sacred, a gift from God to share with the world. If you are an Opera lover you would truly love this album, but I enjoy his love songs more than his opera."
3,Wrong,"""Mercè, diletti amici"" IS an aria for tenor from Ernani. There is a soprano aria from the Sicilian Vespers with the same opening phrase. If you want to hear THAT sung to absolute perfection, check out Beverly Sills' version."
3,"Sorry, but.....","....even if it was Andrea Bocelli who's singing the songs of the man and his music, I'd have to say this album (not the composer himself) isn't all THAT great compared to say Sacred Arias. Since I'm an Andrea Bocelli fan, I do appreciate the dozens of surprises here, like those high Cs on tracks like ""Di Quella Pira"" and especially the high D on ""Possente Amore"" (I swear, he blew me away). However, ""Io La Vidi,"" ""Mercé, Diletti Amici,"" and the last track (from La Forza Del Destino) don't cut it. On others, I don't see too much revitalization of the music that Andrea loves to death. There's one good thing about this album, and it's Andrea Bocelli. My taste--no big surprise--leans toward his pop side, on which he's SO much more accessible. Even Sacred Arias gets my two thumbs up because it's music from heaven. Still, if you Andrea Bocelli fans out there prefer his pop side over his opera side, I'm with you. Romanza is by far the BEST AB album I've heard."
2,Ordinary Monsters,"Started this book and read the first 3 chapters and stopped...it's poorly written, boring and the characters are not interesting at all; I didn't care about any of them, so the book is not worth reading, in my opinion."
1,So just how awful can this DVD set be?,"Very... so I picked this up for next-to-nothing, figuring, it's got to have _some_ redeeming features, gratuitous t&a... _something_. But, there is simply no good reason to own this DVD, unless your you and friends made this DVD on a lark, and you're actually in one of the four movies! Wanna-be Blair Witch meets goth crowd, meets weekend acting club meets poor production quality."
4,not bad for a b movie,"brain damage films have done some interesting takes on the vampire story. blood sisters was one this si another. this darkness is not a great film, not brain damage best but its worth watchin. the scientific parts are a bit hard to grasp if you dont have a science background but its interesting how this guy accidentaly became a mad scientist. apparently his dna experiments went awire and resulted in mutated humans that are similair to vamps. more sci fi than horror. check it out"
4,Good little flashlight,Good little flashlight that stays where it should and shines light where I want it to.
5,Contact lense storage solitiom,This is the best contact lense product I have ever used. It was dificult to find. Only could find it on line. My doctor recommended and she was absolutely right.
1,Don't use this product!,"I thought I would try this product since it was a cleaner and soaking solution in one. This is the worst eye product I have ever used. Only after a few hours my eyes were dryed out,became very red and I could not wait to go back to Boston solution."
4,Just be sure to rinse it off,"I have worn gas permeable contact lenses for 40+ years and used Boston products. Since the original wetting/soaking solution has been tinkered with, I have had a problem with the lenses clouding. I switched to Optimum and did not realize that the storage solution needed to be rinsed before wetting and inserting (contrary to the Boston system). Who can read the small print without contacts? OOOWW!!. Burns and in fact I had to keep lens out for 24 hours. The Optimum wetting solution did the trick. Just wanted to warn others not to make the same mistake I made. If I can't be a good example, let me be a terrible warning."
5,The Gold Standard,"My opthamologist recommended this to me many years ago. It is hard to find in a retail or drug store. It does a fantastic job of cleaning the lenses with just a tiny amount of fluid. One bottle lasts me over a year. My gas perm lenses have been clean for as many as 7 years, and the only reason I got a new lens is because I lost it. When an eye doctor looks at a 7 year old contact lens and remarks that it is spotless, and this is the product you use, that pretty much says it all. It is also exceptionally gentle for senstive eyes. Combined with Unisol for rinsing, it can't be beat."
5,Just what I needed,I bought these folders to hold various lesson plan materials and art supplies.I'm in an Elementary Education program and I make TONS of materials for my lessons that don't fit in typical folders.These hold lots of things and allow me to organize more.They are very sturdy.
3,Before you get those training wheels . . .,"If you know absolutely nothing about trading, this is a good place to start. However, don't expect to make any money without a great deal more work. Ms. Harris does a pretty good job of listing the things that need to be done before starting to trade, but doesn't treat any single topic in sufficient detail to really cover it. That said, this is still a pretty good book, as long is it is viewed as a study guide, and not the real text."
3,Missing basic explanations of terms,"If you already know the terms used in trading and are looking for a reference to other authors, this book is for you. If you are looking for some one to explain the jargon of trading, look else where. A lot of repeat information spread between chapters. Very general in nature."
3,"A light intro, Trading 101 delivers on its' title...","A light and quick read...good introductory coverage of technical analysis, money management, and a few insights into the psychology of trading. Also a reasonably organized source of information for further reading and research (books, software, web sites et al).What pulled my rating down were two things: the editing was atrocious, with reams of paragraph repetition; and the author's tone was overly simplistic (but I can overlook this somewhat given the general overview nature of the work).If you want a book which gives you a good introduction and more fodder for additional reading, this will do fine.."
4,ITS OUT ALREADY!,"THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE,BUT IT NEEDS TO HAVE MORE ACTION INSTEAD OF MORE DRAMA.MORE HYNAS ALSO! I LIKED IT ALOT CAUSE IM FROM WHERE ALL THESE GUYS ARE FROM .THE ONLY THING I DIDNT LIKE IS THERE WERE NO VIDEOS ,OR INTERVIEWS AT THE END,THAT SUCKED!"
5,"Tacky, smart and fabulous.","Good for several laugh out loud moments. The book's cover can also be folded out to display the page, or ""thought"" of the day. A very funny book."
5,Gotta love it,This is a great birthday gift for anyone with a sense of humor and thinks being a b..... is normal!
4,Fun,"Great gift for a friend...I gave to my Mom, she absolutely loved it! Not for everyone, especially if your Mother or friends are big Church going, republican voting, stick up the butt types. I think they sell Bibles on Amazon for them?!?!?"
5,Very Informative,I didn't know that cotton was such an interesting subject until I began reading this book. It was well written and contained so much information.
3,Too much about the author,The beginning was kind of slow - it was about how the author grew up in Lowell. Fine but not as interesting as the real meat of the book.
3,Mo' Horizons - ...And The New Bohemian Freedom,"Mo'Horizons returns to colonize Latin-American music once again. It's definitely well-worn territory, but they do their best to keep things fresh. ""Drum'n Boogaloo"" gives a nice boost of funk with the Latin horns, and ""African Sunset"" takes us to that southern continent with a bit of harmonica thrown in for good measure. ""Shake It Loose"" is actually more of a shimmy, while ""Morning Bay"" lets loose the sitars. But overall, there's a been-there-done-that feeling on this album. I would have liked to see more stand-out tracks, instead of nice-sounding but plain retreads."
2,cannot listen to it,"I bought it and thought it was an audiobook of CD, but it is actually a cassett. My mistake. So I don't have a cassett player and I may have to wait till later to get myself downgraded to a cassett player in order to listen to it."
1,Dental Fresh Review,"I tried the Dental Fresh product as instructed and both my dog and cat had episodes of vomiting. My dog literally refused to drink her water afterwards. I have a well and neither of my pets are used to exposure to chlorine, which the product contains. Apparently, they don't tolerate this chemical any better than I do. I passed it on to my neice who had recommended it. Thanks, but no thanks."
5,terrific net,This net is light weight and I use it for cathing baby chickens that have been living in local parking lots.It's great for just about any small animals.Including small fish.
3,Soundtrack Great...origin not so great...,So many people don't know this but there's a loop hole in international law that allows Copyright protected music to be illigaly sold to the United States via Taiwanese companies. Basically they make illigal copies of the CDs and sell them at discounted rates. They do this because they pay no royalties back to the licence holders. MIYA Records is one such company. I thought given the price I would be getting a genuine product. Guess not... The only way to ensure your getting a genuine product is to go thru a Japanese retailer that ships internationally like CDJapan and pay and arm and a leg.As for the OST...it's terrific! Music is beautiful and worth owning if you like BGM or modern classical.
3,Hell With the Ladies,"As far as books go, this is purely a beach read. I think I devoured it in a day knowing only Julie Kenner as an author. Honestly as far as her works go it wasn't her best but it was entertaining. Out of all of the stories, Dee Davis' was the most suspenseful. It's not a bad book to buy but as I said it's nothing more than a beach read. Light and fluffy only dark because the subject matter deals with Satan and soul stealing."
3,A Hot Romance!,"Andrea ""Andi"" O'Rourke is a fire Captain and she has worked hard to be seen by her men as a strong person...not as a woman. But, now something or rather someone has changed that. His name is Tucker Fields and he makes her melt and challenges her at every turn. She's not used to not having the upper hand and Tuck is not used to being submissive. Will it work out between them?Tucker is a arson investigator. He has been called to help Andi and her crew solve several suspicious fires. He is not expecting a fire of a different kind to flare between him and the sexy captain. But, will he be able to walk away from her when it's time for him to move on or will he finally find a reason to stay?This was a fair romance but what kept it from being great is Andi. This character was just too strong and it made the romance between Tuck and her seem forced and less then romantic. Still the heat between the characters is hot and the mystery of who is the arsonist is engaging."
1,Definitely NOT worth the money.,"Yet another author (like Lori Foster) that's more interested in writing as many graphic sex scenes as possible at the expense of plot or character development. Come on ladies, if you want to write porn, write porn. But if you want to write romance, as this book is classified, build up the characters first and don't have the sexually expclicit come-ons and thoughts (of the characters) happen by page 5. I found this so annoying I only made it to page 43 before throwing the book down in disgust. I'm even more disgusted knowing that I paid $14 dollars for this. Wish there was a money back guarantee on these things."
2,Only helpful if you are in a class,"The book is very informative and insightful. The workbook, however, is really only good if you are taking one of their classes."
1,Not what I expected,"I ordered this for a friend, thinking it was the same Bruce Fisher book I bought when I divorced. It is ONLY the workbook and really needs a workshop (or maybe just a book) to go with it. It was a total waste of money and not what I expected when I ordered. Make sure you are ordering the book, not the workbook, when you order."
4,"Good workbook as companion to ""Rebuilding"" book","Although this workbook is meant to go along with the ""Rebuilding"" workshop, it can still be used without the workshop, in conjunction with the ""Rebuilding"" book. It has some additional information to think about and exercises to do as you are healing from the loss of your relationship."
5,Excellant service,This produce was everything I expected and the service was fast and professional. I would always have confidence using amazon as the result of this purchase.
5,Fascinating!,"I used this book for a paper on cognitive differences between men and women. It is a very interesting topic and the book's easy-going, compelling style drew me in and made me want to read more. It gave me a new perspective on gender differences."
1,Better products available - fell apart,"Purchased about two years ago. After 18 months the brush came off the handle due to using nonwaterproof glue. About 6 months later, the blade attchment came off the razor. Probably the same glue problem. The cup lasted 6 moths before the silver eroded off the bottom to bare copper. A product like this should last at least five years."
4,yum,"I bought the 10 pack 6 months ago and just finished it. Kraft was offering a special so I bought this and a few other items that are still around. I found the kits to be the same as the store, but cheaper, and the fact that I haven't had to buy a taco kit in 6 months is great!"
3,Good Meal!,The tacos are great. We love them and can't fing this dinner at our local stores. Plan on buying extra taco shells though because about 1/2 will be broken on arrival.
2,What ever Happened to the Little Dog......,"OMG...Please save yourself...these are Terrible!!!! BEWARE...Step AWAY from the CHEESE SAUCE..WOW! My Kids talked me into buying these, since we have no Taco Bell within sight (thank you, thank you) I suppose if you are literally STARVING they ""might"" be good...but otherwise, look for the box they come in for a wholesome meal! I have never had a problem with Amazon or their shipping practices...but Taco Shells do not fair well..I don't care how many air pillows they put in there..It's just not gonna happen! I did not give it 1 star for the fact that I did prepare the meal, and we all ate..so at least it gave us SOME kind of feeling of moving our jaws up and down while swallowing harshly. And back to the topic...I think these were the reason for the poor dogs demise......."
4,These tags are fine,"They are luggage tugs -- nothing too exciting. But, they have a nice look that is both bold and yet complements my luggage. One thing I didn't realize when I purchased them was that they are ""privacy"" tags. So, from the outside, all you see is your name. You have to slide the unit open (or add another tag) to have additional information (like phone number, address, and email) listed. Not really a big deal -- I actually like the privacy that it affords."
3,"Not ""real"" great","I was really looking forward to Phil Ball's take on the greatest soccer club team in the world after Morbo--his brilliant history of Spanish soccer--but this was a tad disappointing. It's a good book, for sure, but I didn't get the relevance of references to how each Real Madrid great rated on the 100th anniversary fan poll. I also thought there'd be more than a little over 200 pages. I understand brevity but this book deserved about 200 more pages.Whereas Barca--A People's Passion by Jimmy Burns rocked. This history of their great rivals fell a bit flat despite a lot of good info in here. It just needed more fleshing out to get a greater feel for each era in the club's history."
2,Disappointed,"I have to agree with Brian Maitland's review. In addition, I can't believe this book does not have a single photo. I mean, a book on one of the most important soccer teams in history and not ONE photograph? That is just ridiculous..."
5,Big Bang-Little Buck!,"I bought this for my 17ft. Bayliner boat that was equiped with a nice Kenwood receiver and four, 6 1/2 two way speakers. The system needed some bass in the worst way. The the Bazooka 8-inch 200 watt marine subwoofer delivered big time. It fit neatly under the rear seat, was easy to install,(under 30 minutes), and sounds great. Purchased it through Ship Sound for about 1/2 of retail price and I couldn't be more pleased! If you want big bang, for little buck you can't go wrong here!"
1,Too short in front,"I have 2 pairs of these shorts from a couple of years ago and I love them, but this year's edition is a different story. The shorts are extremely short in the front, maybe 2.5 inches from the top of the chamois to the waist. Very uncomfortable and if you were to sit up and raise your arms it would be, lets just say not very pretty."
2,"Beyond me, folks","I have a fairly comprehensive Zen library (at least 100 volumes anyway) and bought this on the strength of the gushing reviews on the back cover. Big mistake. Zen koans obviously aren't supposed to ""make sense"" on the rational level or be susceptible to critical analysis in the same way you might analyze a poem, but the vast majority of these are simply dumb and unenlightening, followed by an equally dumb and unenlightening series of questions, followed by an equally dumb and unenlightening ""commentary."" I frankly stopped reading after about 200 of these. ""Huang Po asked Zen Master Fu Hong why Bodhidharma came from the West. Fu Hong replied, 'The stone cow sits in a green chair.' Question: What did Fu Hong mean by 'green chair'? Commentary: Fu Hong made a big mistake. Grow up, fat boy."" If that's your idea of the path to enlightenment, add this book to your library. If not, buy ""Repo Man"" and watch it eight times."
1,Unenlightenment,"After reading this book it was clear that koans are not a useful practice for pursuing the truth. The author lists numerous koans, and then gives some ludricrous explanations in the form of pretend wisdom based on his view of the doctrine of Buddhism. Daily life will give a Zen student all the koans needed to pursue ultimate truth. Studying koans only helps fill a student's head with more fake ""knowledge"".Zen is the ultimate psychology of self knowledge, and it's misleading to think that koan study helps achieve anything."
3,Not very specific for FJ60,I bought this book because I have an 85 FJ60 but I don't recommend it. It has more information and pictures of the FZJ80 but very little on the FJ60. Just look at the cover.
4,excellent DIY manual,"If you own a land cruiser, this is a very useful book. My only gripe is that it spends a lot of time detailing stuff we already know, but that is probably intentional given the target audience. Very handy stuff that always remains in my glove compartment!"
3,Must have if you own a Land Cruiser,"Good manual with strong electrical schematics and diagrams. Well documented so it's easy to follow. It does span several years (80-96) and at least 3 models (60, 62, and 80), which can be confusing. Be sure you are looking at the proper diagram for your model. I've found it quite helpful."
3,Poor recording quality. Not with the original comets.,"Recording video and sound quality is not good at all compared to today's standards. I guess considering the age of the video it's OK. Haley is not backed up by all his original comets, but the band is doing a good job."
2,A shaky review book at best,"This guide is a shaky review guide at best. Using my experience of the test, the essays, and my excellent teacher, I can successfully say that this book WILL distort your image of the real AP test. The one compliment, if any, I can give, is that the outlining and notes of each section was sufficient. Besides that, the practice tests were absolutely awful, and the sample grading the author provided was inaccurate. In one edition (I think it was 2nd), I scored about a 30/80 on the multiple choice section, and freaked out. The only ""5"" essay the author provided was absolutely stunning---so stunning that the only way someone could have written that was by totally cramming on that topic and that topic alone, then getting lucky on test day. I don't recommend this guide at all. And I certainly didn't get a 30/80 on the multiple choice on the real test, seeing as how I got a 5. I recommend Princeton Review or Arco for AP Euro."
2,"I kept an OPEN mind for this book, but it didn't MAKE the CUT","I was keeping an open mind while reviewing this title because I KNOW everyone has different learning methods, but I don't think being presented with spaztic, unorganized material is one of them. This is one of the most poorly organized books I have every studied. But in all fairness, I WAS subconsciously pinning it up against the Cliffsnotes and Princeton Review which are FAR more efficient to study. The essays that are presented are FAR TO DETAILED and not a good indication of the expectations of the College Board, especially with the few minutes given to write the essay (DBQ and free-response). I was very surprised at this Barron's book, because its SAT and other AP exams preps are among the elite."
2,HARD TO READ WITH USELESS FACTS,Just took the AP Euro exam today- go for the Cliffs AP European History review book instead of this one. The writing is very hard to read and the review section skims over important facts while covering minute groups and details. The multiple choice and scoring for the free-response are much more difficult than on the actual exam. The only good thing about this book is the large amount of practice free-response topics with the answers. Feel like I got a 4 or a 5 with the Cliffs-I'll find out in July!
3,Average...,"Barron's can be very boring. It is just a list of all the essential facts that you need to know for the exam. However, it is a good refresher of everything you've learned. I would recommend getting this early in the year so you can use it to review for class tests as well. I didnt use any other review guides, however I had an amazing teacher and a great book (McKay), and I managed to score a 5. So I think the point is, that if you study, you'll do well...But as for Barron's, it comes out as just average."
2,Eh...,"Okay review guide, I bought this trusting the Barron's name and after glancing at it a little bit. I hate how the multiple choice explanations don't tell you why the answer is wrong but what kind of question it is. It's only a month into the year but I'm pretty sure I'll be buying a new book to use with this one."
4,"Wonderful design, good but not great execution","I was looking for a comprehensive introduction to creativity research for students that combined a mapping function--showing what is out there by whom trending where--and a grounding interest function--showing how the research really does elucidate and give insight on insights, creation, etc.. Well..... The table of contents was perfect--absolutely perfect. But half of the articles served purely as mappings, with little or no insight provided. One does not know immediately whether to ascribe this to a fault in the articles included on in the research surveyed. Students who happened to get assigned good chapters came away excited, but those who happened to get assigned purely mapping chapters were bored by creativity research and hard to keep motivated. So now I have to use Sternberg's earlier book on Insight along with this Handbook. I apologize for the honesty of this review. It is a great mapping book and a moderate insight provider in sum."
2,too blue,"I bought this item in hopes of being more ""green"", but what a disappointment. The light given off by these bulbs is blue and cold. I would never use it indoors. Maybe it's suitable for a garage, attic or an underused basement space."
4,Good value - tricky tuning,works as expected but tuning on an analog display is tricky. Especially on this small radio. However once you are tuned reception is good and sound quality is OK (considering this is a pocket radio).I use it on my desk while I work and 99% of the time I'm tuned to the same station so this is perfect for me. If you change stations more frequently I would consider a digital tuning radio.
3,Unpleasant sound but OK for an emergency radio,"For ten bucks one shouldn't expect much. The radio works, pulls in nearby stations with minor background static. I would rate the sound as poor (about what you'd expect from a ten dollar radio) with a very harsh tone that grates the ear. As an emergency radio for power outages I would grade it as acceptable; for general listening I would rate it as unacceptable. I also own the Sony ICF38 radio which offers much superior sound (size does matter) for about ten bucks more and would highly recommend purchasing that unit over this one."
1,Don't buy it,Volume goes from no sound to extremely loud with only a slight touch of the wheel. Can't pick up my favorite local station. Definitely not worth the bucks.
4,Good little guy!,"Great reception. Left ear out only. Volume very sensitive, goes from zero to loud in the haed phones but flows ok through speaker. Only complaint is earphone jack is on the side, would fit better in pocket if it was on top or bottom. Recommend!"
2,not great reception,I was looking for a radio that would get good reception and bought this based on other reviews. I was disappointed. Since then I've bought a little Sansa clip MP3 player that has an FM radio - it gets better reception than this Sony. Neither are as good as our Bose radio/CD player for getting marginal FM stations.
5,Looking for an AM/FM pocket radio? You found it.,"Based on all the great reviews here, I bought two of these a couple of years ago (when they were still $10). I keep one on my workbench and one next to my easy chair. Both radios get an hour or two of use per week, and both are still on their original batteries. In an era when no electronics sound good unless they cost at least $300, these radios are amazing. Of course you can't expect them to be something they aren't - but you can turn the volume up a long way with no distortion and for a mono pocket radio the sound quality is quite good. I still think it's a bit odd that they use a pair of AA batteries instead of the 9V ""transistor radio"" battery that was invented just for radios this size, but that's OK. Highly recommended."
5,Sony ICF- S10MK2 AM/FM Silver,"For 10 bucks you can't beat it.I live in a rural area in southern Ohio( hill area), get stations at night as good as my GE Super Raido, day time is fine as well. I listen to 700- Cin, 650-Nas,1260-Port, many others.If you wanta good raido get this one."
4,Great for 10 dollars!,"I was looking for a radio that was cheap and high quality. I live in a rural area so I needed something that had very good reception. This is a steal for 10 dollars!Okay, so here are the PROS: It's ten dollars. It can receive about 20 stations on AM, and 30 stations on FM. The speaker is quite loud. It fits into your pocket easily. On the dial, it is pretty accurate.Here are the CONS: The digits don't always show up correctly. It is a bit bulky. I've had it for a year and when you try to turn it on, sometimes it does not always turn on. It scratches SO easily. It needs a Mono-Stereo converter, but you can just buy one of those for $2.69 at Radioshack. Also, I would like to have known that there is no power adapter jack in it.If you listen to the radio on an average of one hour per day, then the batteries last you about 5 months. Is great for hiking or biking."
2,Does it work well outside of USA?,"I bought this to listen on my vacation in Istanbul,Turkey.Unfortunately,I could only hear few stations without static and background noise.Does anyone have any idea why this wouldn't work in Istanbul?I figured out that there are many more stations in Istanbul than Seattle,but is that the reason or is the technology not suitable for outside of US?"
5,Definitely worth $10,"great reception, great sound, works especially well at work when listening to a ballgame, only need one ear bud since it's not in stereo."
4,Emergency radio,"I needed a new battery operated radio to use in case of a power failure. The Sony ICF-S10MK2 Pocket AM/FM Radio had fairly good reviews and the price was reasonable. The radio arrived as promised. It's really good looking and the sound is good, too"
4,Very pleased!,"The product works very well for what it is. It is great for talk radio and listening to sports. If you want it for music, you will be disappointed. I knew what I was getting from reading the reviews."
4,SONY FM/AM PORTABLE RADIO,"WELL PLEASED WITH THE SONY RADIO (2 PURCHASED). I ALSO PURCHASED (2) BELL & HOWELL 9 BAND RADIOS, AT THE SAME TIME, & ONE DOES NOT WORK!! DISAPPOINTING, TO SAY THE LEAST...."
3,Pocket Radio,The radio is fine for the price. The antenna should articulate 90 degrees from the way it does so that it would not cause the radio to tip over when extended.
3,Fantastic Sounding with ONE MAJOR FLAW,"This radio brings back memories of the original transistors that I grew up with. It has a sound that cannot be matched by any other in it's class. However, it has ONE MAJOR FLAW that is hard to overcome.The earphone jack is placed on the SIDE of the radio instead of at the TOP. Thus making it just about impossible to put in a shirt pocket. I have gone through two sets of ear buds in less than a month. By the way, does anyone sell an ear phone set up with only one ear bud?"
5,MUD PROOF!,"I have three of these things, used to have four but one was stolen by a low life drug-head burglar. When the police returned it to me it had been burned, scratched up , and the tuner dial was messed up, who knows what kind of sick things Robert VillaLobos (the multiple convicted burglar in Garden Grove, CA) did to the thing. That was the one that was broken beyond repair. Anyway, I knocked another one into a pool of mud while gardening. I pulled the battery, opened it up and hosed out the mud, let it dry out for a couple days and it still works great! For $10, you cant lose on this radio!"
5,Awesome Little Radio At A Great Price,We have power outtages here during the tornado season and you really have to have a battery run radio to know what is going on. I bought this little beauty for just that reason. Not only is it a very attractively designed radio but it works perfectly. It even has a headphone outlet! The long antenna makes for a clear reception and it folds up neatly. I am very happy with it. It only needs two AA batteries.
4,"Works fine, but not as I intended.",This works great as far as receiving radio signals and playing all regular stations. It's small and light weight. The disappointment is that it does NOT play in stereo when attached to headphone/earbuds. It only plays out of one ear.
4,Good little radio,I've enjoyed this little guy for a while now and it seems to get good enough reception for a low cost unit. It's getting tough to find really good portable radios since so much has gone to smart phones. Good deal!
5,works great!!,"I purchased for my mom who had a Sony boom-box in her kitchen since the 1990's that just stopped working. She loves this radio because she only uses the radio fm function and it is so small and compact. It hardly takes up any room on her counter. It has great reception, it plays very loud and clear. Sony makes great quality and long lasting products and I'm sure this radio will live up to Sony's longtime and wonderful reputation. It runs on 2 AA batteries which last mom a pretty long time as long as she remembers to turn down the dial all the way :) I have searched through many stores but only Amazon seems to carry this style and model. Thanks again Amazon, you have the worlds greatest shopping selecion and I'm never disappointed with any of my purchases!"
3,not bad,Not a bad little radio....but for a similar price....you can get a Panasonic or RadioShack pocket radio with better sound quality.
2,ear bud problems,"Nice radio, however when using ear buds, you can only get audio from one of the ear buds. I have never owned a radio where you could only get audio from one ear bud. Sony should fix this problem."
2,You get what you pay for...,"I bought this radio after reading some good reviews on how great the reception was. They must have gotten a different radio than I did. The radio doesn't lock onto stations at all, and it's very difficult to get it tuned in to even a strong station because the analog dial has very little play in it so you need to get the setting just perfect since even a hairs-breadth off means lots of static. The only thing worse than the reception was the sound quality which has a very tinny sound. The only reason I am giving it two stars is that it is so inexpensive you can't expect much. And on that point it delivers."
3,Not As Good as some reviews say!,"Pros: Battery Life, PriceCons: The tuner is kind of too sensitive, Lot of static even with local FM stations, Poor reception depending upon location (my FM radio bought at dollar store has better reception at these times:()"
5,Sony pocket Radio,I was in need of a small radio and sony gave me just what I needed. Easy to carry and a great sound for a small radio
5,well worth the ten bucks,"sure, its cheap plastic with a battery door that can get lost, but for $10 its the best cheapie radio i've found. rated at up to 45 hours on a set of new 2xAA batteries, i instead run mine in ""used"" batteries that don't have enough power to run other electronic items with more draw. yet i get hours and hours of additional use out of those ""used"" batteries. i like having this radio that tunes in stations with a thumb dial because i can dial in stations that my other automatic-tuning radios can't, because the signal isn't strong enough for them to lock on to. sound is a bit tinny but what else would you expect from such a tiny speaker. all in all, its a fine radio for $10."
3,Small portable,"Bought this radio for use during power outages. Reception is great and sound better that I thought it would be. As with all small, non digital, radios station tuning is a little difficult, particularly FM stations."
3,Amazon's Sony radio,Was pleased with appearance. Had trouble with antennae - couldn't get it upright. Was satisfied with it considering the price.Bernie.Rutgers@gmail.com
5,I love this radio,everything about this little radio is a 5 star .. it far exceeds my expectationswould definitely recommend it to anyone.
3,Worth every penny of the 7.35 from Amazon,"OK for the money. Selectivity and sensitivity are fine. Has mono output on headphones.Volume dial has weird way of not gradually getting louder; happens all at once at one point. This SONY portable replaced a ""No Name"" brand and is about the same."
5,fantastic for the money,"I've been looking for a few months for an am/fm radio like this. I felt silly waiting so long and spending hours searching and reading reviews but it paid off. This radio not only gets my local stations, the only reason I really wanted it, but gets ones over 50 miles away with the antenna not even fully extended! If you are in the market for a tiny am/fm radio with decent sound, don't even hesitate, just get this one.edit: it's just about 3 weeks later and I'm very disappointed in the battery performance. It's used less than 10 minutes a day and is already dead and yes they were fresh batteries. I have a no-name radio at work and it's on over 7 hours a day and the batteries last longer than this radio.8/7/09well the other batteries must have been duds because these are going strong and it's been a few months. I'm happy with the reception of my local AM station."
2,Not like the good ol' days...,"Poor sound, very tinny and lots of background noise. Difficult to get stations, even with the antenae. . Wouldn't recomend it to a friend."
3,Very nice with one flaw,bought this on sale from a brick and mortar store. Works fine rugged with good tone but dial is very small and difficult to use.Sony quality is there in a nice form factor but not for use in dimly lit areas. Saw this model in a Brazilian movie apparently it has become iconic. The AM-FM portable for the early 21st century.
5,Great radio for news,"I use this radio in the bathroom to listen to NPR when I'm getting ready and showering. It is loud enough to be easily heard in the shower, and the sound quality is adequate. High-pitched sounds can be a little grating, but this is not frequently a problem for me when listening to the news."
1,ZERO Reception,"If you love listening to static. Please, by all means, pick this up. I have the Sony Walkman Radio (SRF-M37V) and have some trouble with reception in certain areas so I figured I'd buy this due to the ratings given by other customers and the fact that this one has an antenna. My Walkman doesn't.However, my Walkman picks up stations. This one picks up NOTHING. Don't be fooled by thinking the over foot long antenna does anything but look stupid and dated. I'm thoroughly disappointed with this purchase and can't help but feel contempt for the other people writing reviews on this item. Maybe they're content writers working in the Internet Marketing division of Sony?I couldn't rate this item with zero stars so unfortunately I have to give it one. One it doesn't deserve. Be warned. If you don't live at the base of the radio antenna, don't buy this item. I'm not even sure it would pick up a signal there either."
1,NG,"A typical pocket radio, but with an inconvenient FM antenna.Not long after purchase the volume control became noisy and continued to deteriorate with time. It is now almost impossible to adjust.I have many Sony products (TVs, FM tuner, CD player, DVD player, etc) but this little radio is a ""bummer"".My next one will be Panasonic."
1,Not very good,"Poor, bulky design with monaural side mounted earphone jack and no included headphones. Difficult to tune and tinny, flat sound. I guess much more than this should not be expected considering the price."
2,sent it back,Does not work properly with headphones and didn't feel the need to have to buy an adapter to get it to work.
2,Earphones do not work,Really a pretty good sounding radio for the price. Right earphone sound does not work. Would cost more to send back than the radio is worth.
2,radio review,"This radio would be fine in a pinch. It works okay for a basic, inexpensive radio. I think it's worth the money and I'm glad to have it in my home."
4,"Very Good Small, Inexpensive AM/FM Radio","I was close to rating this small radio a 5 because it is such an excellent value at $10. It has worked well for us, not disappointing us on the number of stations it brings in. The sound quality is adequate even with it's small size, but it is better for speech like talk shows and the news than for music."
5,Sony FM/AM 2 Band Pocket Radio,I purchased this little radio to listen to my favorite talk-shows on AM radio. I am completely satisfied with my purchase. It was delivered promptly after my order and in perfect shape. It plays loud and clear and will accomodate a head-set for private listening. It is exactly what I had wanted and hoped to get! I would recommend this if you are in the market - great product!
3,Scratchy volume control,"At the lower levels I like to listen at, the volume control is quite scratchy, with ""dead spots"" that make it hard to adjust to a comfortable level. The sound is also tinnier than I have experienced on other radios of similar size. It's OK. Not worth returning. Seems quite sensitive to AM and FM stations."
3,Sound OK Basic Radio,This is a good basic radio. Sound is only fair and having to turn the volume control off to shut of radio off is a pain. Would love to see an electronic instead of the manual station selector.
4,Sony radio,"Small, compact, good for the price. Hard to get in some stations; but again, great for the price (I paid 9.99)"
2,Mono sound,"I just bought this radio and it only gets mono! It tunes well to a station and keeps the signal even at the gym, but the sound is in mono!"
5,VERY GOOD VALUE FOR MONEY,"I live in a rural area and this radio is great. Looks like an original ""transistor radio"" from the 60's except it sounds much better and has much better selectivity. The ""tuning"" light really helps centering the frequency on AM and FM to get the best quality. Gets all the local AM and FM sharp and clear, and also grings in the DX from Portland and San Francisco. I am an advanced class radio amateur and this radio will see a lot of use at the beach or work site where I wouldn't want to bring a more expensive of my radios, like the high=end Sonys or Icoms."
5,its sony has to be good,I bought 5 to bring as gifts when I went to Dominican Republic to visit my mother. Was good on battery life and had great reception and my mother lives in the mountains about 485 above sea level very happy with product
2,AM BAND SUCKS!!!!,"Okay, I bought this for the news stations, and really, living in an earthquake prone area, to have in case of emergency. Out of the box, even with the the antenna fully extended, I can't get one single AM station to come in. I live in southern california, in a semi-metro area, so I don't understand why it doesn't come in! I can get fm reception...which if there really is a major emergency, I guess will suffice. Bottom line, I can't recommend it."
2,You get what you pay for,I knew I should have paid more for a radio that I could use if the power ever went out. I was right. This radio is not very good at picking up stations other than ones that can probably be picked up on Mars - in other words forget AMs.
5,Wonderful quality for a small price,This is the second Sony pocket radio that we purchased. My elderly Mom wanted one in case her power went out. The radio is small enough to slip into a pocket. It is sturdy and has a wrist strap. But best of all is the sound quality. Both AM/FM come in crystal clear. Sent for a second one because we were so pleased.
5,Perfect for what I wanted,"I purchased this actually so I could keep up with the news while at work. I am unable to receive any AM stations. So I did find an FM to keep up on the news. I like the size, not to big or heavy. It fits right by my computer and it's a perfect little pocket radio. Yes, I would recommend this to other people, that are not looking for only music. I would use an ipod for that. This is great. I purchased a small comfortable ear jack,ear phone. Fits great. Good sound."
3,"Bigger than expected, probably better choices out there for disaster preparedness","Just an FYI: This radio is bigger than it might seem in the photos and description. If you think back to the early 1980s, the ""walkmans"" that you saw back then, then you have an idea of it's size. Given the option again I would pass on this particular radio and locate something much smaller for my disaster preparedness bags."
3,"OK at low price, bulky","When I take a walk, I like to take an AM pocket radio with me. I do this daily. The tuning and volume controls are very sensitive dial type. They won't stay on correct volume of station if I stuff it in a jacket pocket, so If I want to take it with me, I have to carry it in my hand."
5,Very Pleased.,"WE have received the Sony pocket radio, and it is being used regularly, as my wife listens to Hockey games while our team is playing out of town.The reviews were valuable, & were extremely satisfied."
4,"Shockly good radio for the price, unfortunately won't bring in FM on a bike","I was duly warned by the amazon reviewers that I shouldn't count on this radio for great FM service. I'm in Minneapolis, and it works very well in my house. Unfortunately I was taking a chance that it might work on my bike, but my station waxes and wanes beyond my patience. That said, I listen to the local public radio affiliate whose signal isn't as strong as some FM stations which do come in fine, even on my bike.I wish I could give 4 3/4 stars because this radio deserves it. It's made with care from quality materials...almost as good as the first transistor my dad had back in the 50s. If you want a radio for the bathroom, garage, yard, this is the one to buy...QUALITY PRODUCTS DESERVE OUR SUPPORT."
1,Silence is not golden,Nothing said about sound only coming through one channel only when earphones are used. This is annoying. Returned the items.
3,needs improvement,"I only get mono, so with earplugs, only one works. I tried with new earplugs, but still only on works. But otherwise it is fine."
1,0 stars,I bought two of these at Sears after reading these reviews. I accidentally broke the first one after a few weeks when I tried to re collapse the antenna in the dark and broke it at the base.The second radio lost sound after only a day. All that works now is the glowing red light. I could have bought a nice chicken dinner for my family for the $20 I wasted.Buyer beware.
2,good name no so good reception,"I LIKE THIS RADIO,I LIVE IN A BIG CITY AND THE RECEPTION THERE IS NOT SO GOOD, HARD TO FINE TUNE IN, PACKET SIZE?HARD TO WALK WITH ANTENNA OUT THIS RADIO IS GOOD FOR COUNTRY SIDE BUT FOR BIG CITY NO WAY.GOOD SOUND NICE LOOKING,CAN'T USE IT WHEN RIDING THE BUS,SONY SHOULD MAKE A RADIO FOR PEOPLE IN THE CITY."
1,Horrible,"This product is huge! There is no way the cheapness justifies its size. In addition, it doesn't get all the radio stations. How ridiculous is that?!"
3,Cheap but okay,"Price was right, but the outer case is cheesy plastic. Would have liked a metal case to protect the radio."
4,It is good radio,Everything is good except the ear phone output which is mono only. The radio is easy to be used for senior people and it is precise for all the channels.
5,AM FM Radio,The sound is a fine quality for such a small and convenient carrying radio. The battery life lasts a long time so I find the use and convenience well worth the price.
4,I like it,This product has all the features I needed.It keeps me up to date on the local news and has good music stations.If this is all you need then I would recommend this.You certainly can not beat the price.
1,Did not expect this kind of junk from Sony.,"I bought this radio to have something to listen to while walking. It stinks. The reception is lousy even with the antenna fully extended. The antenna is so hard to move around it has practically broken off in the first use and I had to straighten out the clamp with pliers. I have no idea how it could have gotten so bent with just trying to extend it and fold it back up - but it did - because it would not collapse and go back into ""storage"" - so out came the pliers. Maybe it was bent to start with - don't know - all I do know is that it was almost impossible to move around right from taking it out of the package. I really thought I could trust the Sony brand - but this radio stinks."
3,Good but not great,"Radio is small and well-made, but it is very difficult to tune in to a specific station. Tuner not sensitive. Easily moves over a station without actually accessing the station."
1,Pocket AM/FM Radio,Reception is poor. I get a few stations on FM and almost nothing on AM. I am about 30 to 35 miles from most stations.
1,Very disappointed,"I purchased this based on the outstanding reviews. I was looking specifically for AM reception of a station that is about 60 miles away. Due to the short physical length of the radio's tuning dial, there isn't enough space to separate out station signals. Therefore, stations whose frequencies are at different numbers on the dial blocked the station I was trying to receive. I think this radio would have okay reception as long as you were trying to receive a strong signal that is close to you."
1,Lousy FM,I bought this only for its touted FM tuning ability. It is hard to tune at all to any public radio station and useless if I move it at all. I wanted to be able to carry it in my pocket.It was so inexpensive it was not worth the return shipping cost. Very irritating
1,This cheap toy isn't even worth $0.99,"After all the great reviews, I purchased one for listening around town. Now, Boulder, CO isn't the greatest radio town what with mountains and the NIST blackout zone but my car radio works fine all over on a lot of stations I like. I couldn't get this clunker to stay on any station. The dials are the really cheap kind which never work smoothly. The volume was either inaudible or ear-splitting; the comfort zone was maybe an arc-minute wide (OK, not quite that bad but you get the picture)."
3,radio,Gets good reception except in the morning. Receives to many radio stations so it's super hard to turn in.
4,Great little radio,"This radio has very good reception, picking up FM stations 40 to 50 miles away. The sound quality is good and clear for speech. Music is a little ""tinny"" as you have to expect from a small speaker. The dial is easy to read and the controls simple to use."
5,So much for so little...,"I think I've now purchased at least 5 of these little radios...for all the members of my familly.Amazing AM reception, and really decent tone from such a small device.Makes a great ""emergency radio"". Never had any trouble with any of them. I don't know how Sony does so much, for so little money...but I hope the keep making this little gem.Dave O."
5,"SONY ICF-S10MK2 POCKET AM/FM RADIO, SILVER",Excellent radio for the money. Quality product. I am very pleased with my purchase. This radio is as advertised. It's unbelievable the number of stations this pocket radio is able to pick up and the mono speaker has a very good sound.
2,my loss,this radio is the size of what used to be called a transister radio. I wanted to carry in my pocket to listen to at work. could get no reception inside a building. my loss. do not consider this a pocket radio
5,pocket radio transitor,great product person who received it as a gift loved it. listens to old time classics at night by her bed. great gift or for yourself.
4,Good Portable,It was larger and heavier than I would like. About too much bulk to carry in a shirt pocket. Having a speaker is more comfortable than a set of ear buds. Reception is fair without extending the antenna.
4,Good little pocket radio,The wife & I needed a little radio so when we have a power outage we know what's going on. It's perfect & was inexpensive. Plays real clear.
2,Stereo problems,This little radio has some good points. It is sturdy and a nice small size.My big problem with it came when I tried to use it with headphones.I have 4 different sets of headphones and had the same problem withall of them. Therefore the problem was the radio itself.One earphone blasted the sound and the other whispered it.So it's basically nonuseable with earphones. Disappointing.
2,Oh Please!,"Due to the reviews here I went out and bought this radio today at Kmart. What a huge disappointment. I can't imagine what the other reviewers were smoking.This radio has horrible adjacent channel isolation. One example is that I listen to a lot sports radio and the local station is 97.1 FM, but the Country Music station at 95.5 drowns it out. This happens with other stations too.I have a little larger Sony in a bathroom that gets much better reception. In fact the FM radio on my little 1""x2"" Sansa Clip MP3 player (with no antenna) gets better reception than this thing.Hard to tune, but you would expect that.My guess is that most people who have reviewed this radio listen to one favorite station with a strong signal.Only saving grace here is that you won't be out much money. Or perhaps you have use for a knockabout you can leave in a shed with no electricity, but be prepared to have limited station choices."
5,Great value,"Separation between stations is narrow, but if you have a steady hand, you will have no problem. Sound quality, given the size of the radio, is more than acceptable, although not great. Hint: lie the radio down flat on top of a magazine or other material that dampens the sound somewhat. Probably a good idea anyway because the radio is not all that stable in the vertical position. You really cannot go wrong for the money."
2,pocket radio,"This filled a need for an easily-carried reliable battery powered radio for situations like last year's Hurricane Ike (2 1/2 weeks for electricity.) This radio has clear sound, good reception, and a good price."
3,"works well but ""Pocket"" radio description misleading","This radio worked well enough and served it's purposed before I lost it. However, I am not sure why it would be listed as a ""pocket"" radio. With that description, it would make one think it can fit into a small-regular sized pocket. After all, the whole purpose of a pocket is to hold something small. When I received it was shocked to see that the only pocket it would fit in would be if I had a pair of JNCO jeans from the mid-90's.... the ""pocket"" in the product desc. as well as the image definitely makes you believe it's a micro-device... until you get it... SURPRISE! you must carry this around in your hand if you want to listen to it.... which is ok I suppose if you want to look like Cuba Gooding in 'Radio'..."
2,Disappointing,"This product doesn't get the reception I thought it would. I live 22 miles from a 50,000 watt AM radio station, but half the time I can't get that in, much less anything farther away. Looks like we're back to using the TV as our radio to listen to baseball games."
3,deliver fee is expensive.,Product is new. I thought it will be OK. I will use it and know its function. I just want to say this.
5,Works great,I purchased this radio to replace an older Sony Pocket Radio (same model).The radio works well: Reception and sound quality.
2,LACKING QUALITY,HAVE HAD THIS UNIT FOR ABOUT 9 MONTHS.IT REPLACED A SIMILAR PANASONIC THAT LASTED 20 YEARS.SOUND ON THIS UNIT WENT HAYWIRE RENDERING UNIT USELESS.I HAVE REPLACED WITH ANOTHER PANASONIC.
1,Cheap Sony radio,"The Sony mark 2 has many good attributes, including price, but as a Sony, I would have expected better.The tuning and station dials are so touchy you can not get the sound or tuning right without numerous attempts.As one review said, it is either too loud or not loud enough. Just carrying it your pocket disturbes the settings.I do not recomend this radio in its present form.I will now be suspicious of all Sony products."
2,sony pocket radio,Did not like. Not as powerful as $5. one I bought at walmart. Antenna bent from frame so cannot lay it down flat for travel.
4,Good simple radio.,This is exactly what I wanted - a simple radio that I could thrash around in my tackle box and not worry about. It works great for the price - happy.
4,Emergency radio.,I bought this to replace a Coby CX50 radio which didn't work at all. The Sony works fine and pulls in a lot of stations. It will be fine as a communications link in case of a weather emergency such as Hurricane Sandy.
5,SURPRISE!!!,"I intend to use this little radio when I go camping - just for a little noise. Coming out of the box, I thought it looked pretty good. I put batteries (2 AA) in it and was really surprised at the big sound from a radio costing under $10. Even though it's analog and the tuning knob could be ""geared down"" to move the indicator a bit more slowly (it's pretty sensitive and moves pretty fast), it picks up everything available here and for some distance. I think it's a SUPER GREAT buy for the price and ideal for my purpose.UPDATE: I recently used this radio on a fishing trip in the ""boonies"" and it did a GREAT job."
4,LeeinOly,"I needed something to distract me while having chemo treatments and did not want to get into an Ipod expense or bother. This little radio has remarkably good sound, especially with an ear phone and it is small enough to fit into a shirt pocket. You do have to be very patient while trying to find a station because the dial is very sensitive and it is not stereo, so you will only get sound in one ear piece. But it is full sound and not ""tinny"" like I remember old transister radios. For the money, it's a great find."
5,Simple Technology,"Nice little portable am/fm radio, great in case the electricty goes out. I had one in my car for years but it got stolen. I needed a replacement and my husband lost his on his jobsite so he also needed a replacement. The radio works great."
4,Saves Money on Batteries,"Great if you're buying it for news, talk, weather etc. not that good for music since it's not stereo. It has a speaker so you can listen that way or you may want those ""dual monaural earphones"" listed on Amazon or a single earphone vs stereo earbuds. The best thing about the Sony ICF-S10MK2 is that unlike digital players this analog radio uses very little battery power, it seems to go forever on a set of batteries which almost outweighs the bad. It's the size of an average cassette/walkman, so harder to lose than some mp3 players, but also not as comfortable/convenient to carry around. Most annoying; the volume dial is super sensitive and can go from zero to blast with a simple touch, so adjust carefully if you've got earbuds on. Something to consider; it will get maybe one or two stations past 1600 on AM but not one closer to 1700 that I get on other radios. As far as being susceptible to frequency interence, it seems average for being what it is: Ten Bucks"
3,For the money....,"It is at least refereshing that you can buy something for $10 and it works pretty good. Having said that it is a $10 am/fm radio. I don't think you can rank the thing as good better best. It is what you'd expect for a $10 radio and that is OK. It sits on my desk, I listen to sports radio or NPR and that is what I wanted it for."
4,good overall radio,"Very good radio for size and price. Somewhat difficult to tune since stations are too close together in such a short dial.A little sensitive to interference, but just move it or turn it and it will sound great.Equally good in AM and FM.Good finish."
3,Sony ICF-S10MK2 Pocket AM/FM Radio,"I am a little disappointed with the radio reception. Its quite static-y but to be fair the reception in the area I live is never great. But, for the price it is fine."
4,SONY ICF - S10MK2 Pocket AM/FM Radio,"This little radio is just what I needed to listen to news, sports and weather. The price was right too. Cool silver look with an antenna and a jack for an earphone...Good sound... This is the one you want!!!"
5,"Great Reception, Great Price","This little radio has really good sound, considering how compact it is. The local FM reception is clear. Even some of the distant AM stations come through. Well worth the money."
4,very good,"Nice little radio, but while it is very good, a radio shack version (same size/price range) has slightly better ability to bring in challenging AM stations; on the other hand, this sony has a much better speaker than the radio shack model, so it depends what you need your little radio to do. Overall, very pleased with purchase."
5,"RF prone, otherwise great","This is a great little radio. The are others in our house that do a better job of rejecting radio frequency interference from nearby electronics like computers and portable electronic devices, but as long as you're a good distance away, or outside, you're fine."
3,Acceptable only,Price: *****Design: ***Reception: ****volume adjustment: ***Sound qulity: ****Earphone jack: *Be careful this radio comes with a monaural side earphone jack!
5,It's great!,"These two portable radios works just fine! I'm glad I bought them. I now listen to Coast to Coast a.m. in the bedroom, and hear it clearly. If I'm listening to an esciting show, I now take the smaller portable radio into the living room while I fix breakfast."
4,Nice little radio,"I needed something that was small and inexpensive to toss into my travel bag and have an alternative to the TV/cable in hotel rooms, etc.. This little guy is just the ticket. Sound is reasonable, reception has not been a problem in AM or FM tuning. For around ten bucks, you can't go wrong."
4,Little Sony AM/FM radio,This unit works well and has darn good sound for a small speaker. Two AA batts power it. Not sure if it will last the 40 hours or not the specs say but will try it out.I needed a radio for traveling and taking to sporting events so I can follow the play by play. Always nice to have a small portable around.I recommend it to anyone who needs a good basic radio.
1,No AM reception at all,"Bought this for occasional use, and to listen to the local emergency station during power outages. San Diego has about 50 AM stations.... this radio would only pick up 2, and both poorly. Wouldn't pick up the local emergency station at all. FM worked better, but that was not why I bought it. Sending it back."
1,FM unusable in San Diego,"I bought this Sony radio to replace a similar ""Studebaker"" radio (retro look radio sold on Amazon). Though the Studebaker was looked ""cheap"" it worked just fine until i lost it!The Sony has a nice look & feel, and AM perfomance is acceptable, but the FM tuner only picks out 2-3 VERY STRONG signals. These signals seem to bleed across all the FM band. This may be a defective unit, but it's not worth the shipping to send it back.If you need a small, simple radio, buy it locally, before you leave the parking lot, pop in the batteries and test it. If it has problems, walk it back into the store."
2,Disappointing For My Use,"I collect AM radios and was anxious to add this cute Sony to my collection. Had I not wanted to actually USE it, it would be fine. I like to listen to my radios in bed late at night and I don't want to disturb my mate. I hold the radio right up to my ear and listen at the lowest possible volume. This radio has no low volume! Ths on/off switch/volume control goes from zero to 50 - nothing in between! No low volumes are available. It's a defective control but who in the world is going to seek a repair or even a refund on a $10 item. If listening at very low volumes and a nice smooth, linear control are important to you... SKIP this poorly made radio. It is not worthy of the Sony name."
4,Solid Radio,"Had this radio for two years and best one I have used for $10. Reminds me of theportables from the 60's and 70's. Does everything well, exceptional battery life.Only flaw for me is it's not a DX machine compared to radios above $100. You can pull in some long distant AM at night on it if conditions are right. But, it won't replace a higher end Sony. Still, a solid performer for $10, and very durable. Dropped it several times and no effect."
5,"Great tone, great reception, great value!","This was another present for my wife whose previous bathroom radio finally died after some 15 years...and Mama's totally happy with it 'cause now she can choose from all kinds of stations, not just the three or four she'd been limited to for all those years. A happy wife makes for a happy house. Amen to that, brother!"
3,"It's a radio, it plays","This is a very simple radio that plays FM and AM stations. I think it has been a little over-rated in some other reviews as though it is some great powerful radio. It works, its fine and it pulls in the local stations I want to hear. If you want a good small radio that plays non-stereo reception, it should work well. The batteries seem to last a long time. Stereo headphones I plug in to it will only play thru one side, but probably because it is not stereo. No radio is going to have the same reception in every location where it is used. The price is about right for it."
4,As good as it gets for the price,"I am not a professional musician, uneducated in music, but the fact is I can hear what I want and for the size of this radio and the small investment, it is all I need when it is needed."
2,"OK, but ...","I bought this a little over a year ago to listen to news shows while I run or bike or while doing yard work. It worked well enough for several months, but now I'm having some of the same issues as other consumers. I find myself having to stop what I'm doing and try to tune in the station I'm listening to, as it doesn't get a clear signal. Sometimes the sound cuts out altogether and I have to play with the volume control. When I'm wearing earbuds and if I'm not careful, it blasts into my ears. But when I listen to it without earbuds, the sound at top volume barely comes through. The most recent problem is with the antenna, which is very loose at the screw where it is attached. I tightened it and it seemed OK for a couple weeks, but now it has loosened again, and frankly, tightening it doesn't seem to make any difference. Maybe this is all I can expect considering what I paid for it, but I did figure it would be more durable."
5,I use it all the time!,"Perfect little radio especially for AM listening, will pull in signals that most more expensive radios won't. Surprising value, recommend highly"
2,"Speaker works fine, earphone jack has problem","bought it from Amazon. Also bought a sony earphone. The speaker is quite good. However, when I plugged in the earphone into jack, only left side has voice. I thought the problem is with the earphone, then tried other 3 earphones which I have been using on my iPod and other radio, same problem.Called Sony support and they agree to let me send back the unit and they will ship a brand new one. However, I have to pay the one way shipping for this $10 unit!"
3,"Low cost, but poor sound quality","For $12 bucks there's no point in being too picky. It's not a bad purchase. However, I found the sound quality of the speak to be grating on the ear. I got a headache when listening to it for more than 20 minutes. It gets good reception though - AM and FM."
2,Not so great,I think this radio was made better years ago. But it is ok for listening to The New York Yankees when I'm lounging outdoors.
2,Not what I ordered,"Yikes, in reviewing the picture, I realized that the radio I received was not this one. I wish it had been! The one I received was much bigger. I am sorry, as I know it was my fault for not checking this out originally. I wanted a small radio and the one I received was much larger and not even a Sony. How I missed that I do not know. Shame on me........"
2,Ok for the price,I thought this radio would be a good value but the volume button is ultra sensitive. Small movements translate into significant changes in volume that becomes annoying when using headphones.
2,reception not good,may work ok in metro areas but not so good in a rural area. AM band is not good even on powerful station like 610 columbus oh.
3,Positive Review,"Radio is pretty much as expected. The volume control is a bit scratchy and the tuner is very touchy, but it does pull in all available stations with ease and is handy for sporting events."
5,Perfect for when lights go off!,This is the perfect little radio especially when you loss power. Can't find one at the stores anymore especially since they only carry 1 or 2. This radio operates on AA batteries that I always have and pretty powerful. Very happy since it was so reasonably priced!
4,sony portable radio,"great radio, better than the panasonic. Unfortunately, the tuning knob (Of both radios) is too sensitive"
3,Months later...,"After many months of use I am somewhat disappointed. Although very affordable, if you plan on using the item with any regularity, upgrade to a digital tuner. The thing is great on batteries, but the tuning is difficult and the volume adjustment is awful. Rotating volume knob yields static and the change in volume goes from low to max, with no in between. Also, max ain't very loud at all. Good for occasional use."
4,handy little radio,By Marj's husband: We have 2 of these. The one we got recently for my wife to use in her office. These run a long time on 2 AA rechargeable batteries. Getting them well tuned can be a little tricky but they work well enough and are a nice size. I hate any of these new pod things where you have to put stuff in your ears - much prefer these old fashioned transistor radios. Oh and their reception can be affected if they are too close to a computer ( less than 2 feet) otherwise fine. NO they're not top end stereo systems but they work fine for our uses.
4,Perfect small portable,"Exactly as expected for the small sum paid!! I wanted a small portable radio, that was cheap, and could use in emergencies, and got stations. And the bonus, it doesn't sound too awful. It isn't HiFi, ya know!! Exactly what I was wanting. Don't understand the other negative reviews, what were you expecting????"
2,Disappointed,"The other reviews touted this little, inexpensive radio as excellent. The old adage, when something sounds too good to be true applies in this case. This radio gets poor reception, is a flimsy, cheap portable radio, and is barely sufficient for stations with the strongest signal, providing poor audio quality. It probably cost Sony $1 or so to build and package and that's what it is really worth. I am keeping it in a draw as an emergency radio, but it is no bargain."
4,Great little Radio,"Listen up folks, for the price you can't beat this little AM/FM Radio @ $10 bucks. I live some 35 to 85 miles away from any AM stations. I bought this radio over 2 years ago and it still operates. Sadly, though, I'm going to have to get a new one. The volume knob is worn out. It wobbles and it creates only a max volume, (tough on your ear piece!). However, it IS over 2 years old! The only complaints I could have about this little radio, is that the AM has always been stattiky, (since I listen to talk radio 99% of the time), that it doesn't come mail-order with ear buds and it's not stereo. I use this radio daily, 5 days a week. FM, however, is no problem. Let me get out my CC to buy another one!"
4,Sony AM/FM Portable Radio,My previous portable would not pick up AM stations I wanted to listen to. The Sony works very well. Once it is set to a station it stays locked on. It performs as you would expect a Sony product to work.
5,what a bargain!,"This isn't my standard radio that I use all the time, but it absolutely comes in handy more than you'd think it would. Great for emergencies, for example. Also love that I can take it anywhere. Am using it more and more these days now that I've switched my music listening to computers and mp3 players, which don't have a radio included."
3,sony portable radio,"For the price, this radio is okay as an extra you might want to carry in the car to keep up with news/sports. It's small, lightweight, and easy to use. Sound quality is OK, however I noticed you tend to lose reception on some stations when you turn/move the radio. If you can spend a little more, buy the Sony ICF-M410V model instead and get real all around quality."
2,Poor sound quality,"Loud echo, you can feel the radio is vibrating in you hand.It is difficult to stand on the surface"
5,great little radio,bought this as a gift for my nephew. He just loves it because it fits in his pocket and he's surprised just how crystal clear it comes in for him.
3,OK product.,I actually purchased this for my elderly Mom who liked to hold it next to her ear as she was hard of hearing. She was not overwhelmed with this product although I thought it was a good buy for the money.
3,Ok little radio,It's ok for the price. It can't help the lousy stations around here. I wasted my money because of the lousy stations.
1,Not happy!,Radio was working fine. Great reception. Then I plugged in my earbud I found that the sound was only coming in to one ear. I thought it was my earbuds but I tried a different set and verified it was the radio. Great shipping! I had the radio for about 2 wks before I checked so the box and rcpt. had been thrown away.
4,Not bad.,"I like the unit. I'm probably the only review in the past year or two for this radio, but I enjoy sitting by the river front sometimes and listening to sports to take my mind off of things, and I like the fact that I don't have to waste my car battery on that. Anyways, that's why I wanted one."
2,Inexpensive Radio,The reception of this radio is poor except for very powerful stations. It drifts from the station. Using the antenna helps but using earphones does not enhance the reception. In future I would buy something more expensive.
4,Great to have during a weather emergency,"I have one of the ""crank"" emergency weather phones, purchased from the company up in Maine, but it doesn't tune in the stations very well -- too much static. This little pocket radio is just the trick -- sometimes simpler is better! I do wish, however, that we're not in such a plastic world -- I remember when transistor radios were made of sturdier material. I would've paid more for this Sony model in metal. But I trust the Sony name! The price was fantastic, too."
3,Didn't live up to other reviews,"I wanted something that I could pick up an AM station about 26 miles away, and based on other reviews, I thought this would. Unfortunately it doesn't but it will still be handy for working outdoors and listening to the FM stations. For the price, I can't say I'm surprised and it was worth a shot."
2,A big disappointment,"After reading all the reviews here and elsewhere I decided to buy the Sony ICF-S10MK2 Pocket Radio. It arrived today and I had 2 ""AA"" batteries ready to try it out. What a letdown!! I tried the AM band first and all I could hear was a strong static hash clear across the AM dial.. I tuned around and found six stations that were strong enough to punch through the hash. This pretty much eliminates searching for weak stations. To be fair, I considered that there may be some local interference and I drove out to the City park, away from all buildings and wires. It was the same situation, hash across the AM band. The FM is fine, stations come in clear and no static, seems to pick up a lot of FM stations. The little speaker does a good job for its size. I will keep this radio for emergencies, but that is it. I am now looking at the Sangean DT-400W as my personal radio. I am grateful that I only spent $12.00 for it."
2,Sony Pocket Radio,"This is a very basic pocket radio - something that would have been avaialble 20 years ago If you have ear phones, prepare for sound on one side only - No stereo. Fair reception."
4,great buy for the money,Love this radio! I use it to listen to am talk shows and news on my walks.It is nice and compact. I dont like the fact that you can hear only through one side of the ear phones. it is durable. I have already dropped it a few times on concrete/asphalt. no dents.no cracks. seems to chug along just fine.I love it!
4,"For ten, its a win.","It has very good am reception. I bought this radio for talk radio shows (mostly coast to coast am) and it works great for that. The speaker quality is ok. FM tuning works well but the speaker is just not good enough for music. It has a output jack but it only works for one ear. From reading reviews i believe you buy a mono to stereo adapter to solve this issue. I accidentally dropped the radio while i was cleaning the garage and it survived a 6-7ft fall but with some damage. The little tuning mark no longer moves so you have to listen for the station you want, but not too big of a deal if you don't need to find a small station. 5 stars - a half star for the ok durability. 4.5 stars. For ten it a win."
3,Use it at work on my desk,"I use this radio at work. I currently have it set to one station - which I don't plan on changing.I'm not sure if it's the location of my desk, or if it is the actual product itself, but sometimes I have trouble getting some station signals.When I do get channels, everything is crisp and clear. Sound quality is great!I'd recommend it. It really is hard to complain at a price around ten bucks. Pay attention to what signals you can get best in your car, that's what will pick up well on this radio."
5,VERY SATISFIED,THIS IS A TERIFFIC LITTLE RADIO.IT PULLS IN DISTANT STATIONS HAS MINIMAL STATIC BASED ON THE WEATHER CONDITONS AND THE DISTANCE TO THE RADIO BROADCASTING STATION.FOR THE PRICE YOU CAN'T GO WRONG.IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A LOW COST POCKET RADIO WITH GOOD RECEPTION BUY THIS ONE
3,Beware of manufacturing issues,I purchased this radio about 2 years ago and noticed the case had rounded edges which on the surface make the unit feel good in your hands. The tremendous downside however is the unit is tipsy on a countertop. As a result I routinely leaned the radio against the wall or another object but this then led to many falls. Ultimately the poor manufacturing of the base edges led to its premature demise. Although the AM reception seemed to be average to above average and speaker volume was good I would suggest considering other units if you plan to have it setting on a table or counter.
4,great,"purchased this as a gift and the person loves it. He uses it daily and has not had a problem with it. I like the fact that it's simply, it was hard to find a simply handheld radio."
5,For the money - can't be beat,"This is a great radio for the money. I bought one for my emergency kit and couldn't be happier! It uses 2AA batteries, so it's great!Pros-price-reception-signal strength-sizeCons-easy to bend antenna-the sound is ""small"" meaning no low range tones, but seriously that's not a big deal"
4,Very good reception,Needed a basic portable here on Cape Cod that would bring in signals I otherwise was having difficulty accessing; reception is much improved with this Sony radio. It is very lightweight. The only negative so far is in the design as the bottom is not flat enuf to stand the radio upright easily. I lean it on something nearby.
4,portable sony,A decent little radio for the price. Reception is good and battery life decent.The only downfall so far is the sound quality when you turn up the volume as loud as it will go.
5,Great radio at a great price,I really like this radio. The price is great at $10. It picks up stations well and has a nice external antenna and a good external speaker. It is great for carrying around the house listening to my radio talk shows!
4,Ok if you don't use headphones,"I am a fan of most Sony products, they just seem to work. I bought this radio to keep for an emergency. It is much bigger than the other radio I got, but the main difference is the headphone jack. The Sony only plays in mono (in one ear). The overall sound through the speaker is great, but if you use the headphones it is a little lame in my opinion."
5,Cute and handy little radio,"I listen to the radio whenever I can and this little radio, lightweight and compact, is perfect. I can listen at night with the earphones and not disturb the husband, take it on walks and jogs, or just put it on the grass while I garden. The sound is loud and clear even without opening the antenna. It only takes two AA batteries. Highly recommended."
1,Sony ICF-S10MK2 Pocket Radio,--Not the usual excellent Sony small radio product. Squeals at low end of station selector. Not happy with quality of reception
2,Can't joing the chorus of praise.,"I'm a little surprised to see all the glowing positive reviews. I got this radio to listen to my two favorite news stations on the way home now that I am vanpooling. The stronger station comes in a little bit when I am lucky. The slightly weaker station is not to be found at all. I'm glad it was only a cheap experiment. I get a couple music stations, but with sound in one ear only in the headphones and poor sound at that, it's not worth it. I thought the picture made it look a little more thin and stylish than it is. But frankly I find it a bit ugly and definitely bulkier than I expected. And yes, the reception problem occurred with the antenae pulled out, which is pretty unworkable in a crowded van anyway."
5,Excellent,I bought this as a cheapo radio to take to work and probably subject to some abuse. Now I can pick up stations that my former little radio wouldn't get in. A nice buy when you don't want to blow a small fortune on a radio (leave those at home) that you'll probably lose or abuse anyway.
5,Sony ICF-S10MK2,"This is a great little radio. I have mine on my bedside table tuned to my favorite FM station 40 miles away, and the reception is excellent. I live in an urban area with many FM stations, and unlike another reviewer I have no problems with interference from adjacent stations. And the price! How can you beat the price?"
4,Help in an emergency,"When the phones, internet and electricity go down, and your radio and TV are useless, this small portable radio is ready for the emergency. I just sent three of them (purchased on Amazon at a great price) to my daughter who lives in a California fire area. I have four in my house, ready in any room for talk-radio or just companionship. No worries with something stuck in my ear either. They don't wear out and batteries last forever. One of mine is so old that I can't remember WHEN I bought it. It's not even the same color as the ""newer"" ones which have been around for a very long time. (I bought my first one just after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.)"
3,Sony lovers?,"Contrary to other reviews I found the AM reception only slightly above average compared to other 10 dollar or less radios. I found FM reception was far worse than almost the all portable radios I had.Sound quality was also terrible compared to even mini radios that were smaller to almost half the size of the Sony in the same price range. I wasn't expecting wonderful sound from a small radio, but I was expecting sound at least as good as I get from radios almost half it's size & price.Recommended for AM talk-radio only where sound quality isn't needed, moderate DXing, & the strongest local FM stations."
5,The Truth...at last!,"The truth about Plato's Atlantis locale: now known as the Azores Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, these may very well be the tops of the mountains of Atlantis, which is now submerged"
5,Saved my arse.....,"I bought these because my current tire setup is a little wide so my rear driver tire slung up a rock and crack my mirror. I got them for a smokin' deal here on Amazon--$50 free shipping. It was an open box item sold by Amazon, but when arrived had everything. It was fairly easy to install. The wire insert feature seems to help keep shape at the sharper curves. It also saved my arse from getting a ticket. I was pulled over for a supposed non working blinker(it worked and I never got the ticket), but the cop circled around my car looking at the tires and said they were borderline, but looked to be ok, so he let me go. Had I not had them on, I'd definitely would've gotten a ticket."
3,Gets the job done,"I got these to keep legal in PA. They look like hell, but they arent $400 like some other flares out there. should hold up decently too, but make sure you trim them not only for looks, but to fit when wheels are turning and flexing a bit up and down. On a Cherokee with a 3"" ift and 31"" tires you will get some rubbing on these in turns at full lock if you follow the lines of the stock fenders."
5,"Gripping, WWII Sea Novel","The Nazis have built the mightiest war ship on the planet and on its maiden voyage its mission is to sink the ship that is taking Churchill to Canada to meet Roosevelt. From this premise emerges one of the best sea stories I've read in a long time. The author, with his authoritative knowledge of the sea, ships and the war, spins a yarn that is believeable, gripping and stirring. I haven't read Wilson's earlier book, but you can bet I will. As for this book, it's in the first rank of military sea tales, for my money."
3,"3 to 3-1/2 stars, Dramatic and Lively","Here is a short review. ""Between the Hunters and the Hunters"" is a good premise for the story during the grey days of WW2 in the North Atlantic. I felt the action was sufficient and the ending was lively and dramatic. If I could bump it up to a three and half I would. There is enough here to make me want to read another Steven Wilson book."
1,The Lovegevity Wedding Planner,"The planner was the biggest waste of money. It doesn't cover any important topics that a bride would need to plan her special day. At the end of the book, the authors try to sell their wedding consultant program which is also a waste of money. If you are interested in consultant programs, go through the ABC or Weddings Beautiful. All of their publications a terrible!!!!"
5,Thin Air by George E. Simpson and Neal R. Burger,"An excellent novel. About Naval experiments done to crew members and the effects these experiments brought about years later. Crew members having nightmares about a ship vanishing from under them and dissapearing itno ""thin air"". Crew members breaking from the safety of interconnected hands and ""going zero"" and ""getting locked out"". Well worth a read. Great plot with lots of twists. I have read it about half a dozen times and it gets better every time!"
3,Bad Listing,"This item was listed as a hardover of Thin Air by George Eaton Simpson, Neal R. Burger only after it arrived did I realize it was a completely different book by the same name. It is hardcover but not the book I ordered. It is quite readable and I will keep it, but buyer beware.This is Thin Air by William Marshall which is not science fiction but a mystery in a series.I was rather disappointed but a friend reads the series so it worked out For me.So be aware Amazon has a bad listing here!"
1,What a mix-up,"The book that these reviews are tied to are not the book they are talking about. George Simpson did write Thin Air, but they are liking it to Thin Air By William Marshall!!!"
5,ahh! so cute..,"This is a very sweet idea. Sutton brings Madison some sunflowers and a big box of chocolate, then they go on they're date to remember. I think this was a very sweet idea. A guy that brings a girl chocolates and flowers is soo romantic!If you are a My Scene fan, you should definetly buy this set! You should also buy a Madison doll because thats Sutton's girlfriend! Sutton is also very cute but dont tell Madison i said that! I love My Scene! Soon i am going to buy the party pad!"
5,Cutest Boy Doll I Have Ever Seen!,I love Myscenes they are the coolest doll yet.But Sutton is a cool myscene boy doll be sidas Eliss. tight doll yha
4,Great for those that eat many small meals!!!,"For those of us that eat many small meals throughout the day this is a *great* product. It borders on being too small--but not quite. I take three to work and they're perfect.They are heavy because they're glass, but I feel completely comfortable microwaving them, as opposed to plastic, which may leach toxins into your food.I'm ordering more even as we speak--it's just a dish, but it's *the* dish I was looking for."
4,Good buy,"Got this for packing lunches w/rice and entree. I hoped it would've been a little deeper, more room in the two compartments overall but i've been able to fit in decent sized portions for my husband. The glass is thicker (and heavier) than expected but I guess that's for sturdiness. I feel less of it would've meant more space."
1,Awful!!!,"This case does not fit the nuvi 295W, it's way too big! I returned it for a refund right away.I had a case lying around for a Samsung Blackjack II that I bought a few years ago that I don't use anymore which is made by Samsung and it fits the nuvi 295W like a glove. I don't know if Samsung makes them anymore.Unfortunately or should I say fortunately I don't use the nuvi 295W anymore as I use the GPS on my SGS II Skyrocket which is way superior. When I bought the nuvi 295W, it was for $74.99 a year and a half ago. It's out dated and the price is jacked up!!! Way over priced now! Why???? It's a POC!!!"
3,nuvi 295,"internet connection very slow, very slow emails, no traffic reports. used in NY city as pedestrian, lost signal quite a bit"
1,Misleading description,"I read the other review and said, ""nah, it was probably just a shipping error,"" and I gave it a try. Nope! What I got was a single padlock - not six. Unlike the other reviewer, I am returning it, and have indicated to Amazon that I did not get what was described. Amazon should take this item down before anybody else is bamboozled the same way, and I'd recommend a review of this vendor."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!,"First of all, I was suppose to receive 6 quality locks, keyed alike. I received ONE lock that felt like if I dropped it, it would break. I also chose this item because free shipping was offered. Yes, I could return my order but, as per Amazon policy, I had to pay around $7 to return it. I know it did not cost that much for actual shipping but I don't think I should have to pay to return an item that was sent to me incorrectly.By the way, I found a great set at a locally owned hardware store for only $7. I tried going to the big home improvement stores and found lock sets keyed alike but the problem was that they were keyed the same as the other lock sets on the shelf. I did not think it was wise to purchase a set just like my neighbor could buy."
5,"B&D 93008A ""DUSTBUSTER"" FILTER BAGS",Good product. Hard to find. Was surprised that the box contained two filters.
5,Excellent book,I had to read this book as well as Dangerous Minds for an Education class. This book is tremendously well written and worth reading even if you are not an educator.
5,"Great book, and great bookstore","The book looks great, although it has been 14 years old. I was satisfied with the shipment.Book is old, but the knowledge is as important as before.I give a five-star."
5,Marva Collins,Excellent book! I already owned a copy and purchased this one for a friend. It is one of the most inspirational and helpful book I have read in regards to my teaching career.
5,Great collection of singable French chansons,"This is a fantastic collection of French songs. If your French is a little rusty, this is a fun way to ease yourself back into the language. I've been amazed how much more French I understand as I listen to these cds! Much of the music is of the 60's variety, with some oldies thrown in, and as another reviewer noted, a great cd of songs sung in French, but from countries other than France.You just have to admire a collection of French Chansons that manages to pull together a bunch of songs that represent the genre really well, but doesn't contain any Edith Piaf. You won't miss her.This the best set of French music I have purchased outside of France. My all time favorite chanson is ""Harley Davidson"" sung by Brigette Bardot, which I found on ""Mega Retro"" purchased in Paris -- sadly not on this collection. But, you won't miss her, either."
3,Great family video,wonderful video....informative and amazed at the story line....everyone would enjoy this if they love animals...the history of these fabulous horses was quite amazing.
1,Miracle of the White Stallions,Kind of a slow movie. Would not watch it again. I bought it because I have visited the winter training grounds of the Lippizans in Florida. I was hoping to see more footage of what these beautiful horses can do.
3,"Muddled plot, but the dressage is amazing","During World War II, the famed performing Lipizzaner Stallions of the Spanish Riding School (actually located in Vienna, Austria) were in direct danger of being destroyed. Colonel Alios Podhajsky (Robert Taylor), the head of the school, does some fancy thinking and persuades a German general (Curt Jurgens) to define the horses as bona fide ""art treasures"" which would allow the animals to be moved out of harm's way. (The real Colonel choreographed all the graceful, spellbinding airs-above-the-ground performance scenes seen in the film.) Based upon the memoir The Dancing White Horses of Vienna by Colonel Alios Podhajsky.Staci Layne Wilson"
5,Miracle of the White Stallions,"This was a very entertaining movie, based on a true story. This makes a great gift to any horse lover."
3,Miracle of the White Stallions DVD,Nice Disney telling of how Lippizan horses were saved during WWII from people who only cared about war and destruction.
2,DISNEYFICATION,"I went to Vienna about ten years ago and saw the Spanish Riding School perform. It was wonderful and though I had heard that the Disney film was not particularly good, I was interested to see it to learn something about the background to the events that took place during the war. The film, starring a Robert Taylor who looks about 100 years old, is pretty pedestrian, but the story is there and as such I was glad I bought the disc."
2,miracle of the white stallion,I'VE ALWAYS LIKE THE MOVIE .BUT THE DVD I RECIVED FREEZE THOUGH OUT THE MOVIE THERE WAS NOWAY I COULD RETURN OR GET AHOLD OF THE PERSON I GOT IT OFF FROM TO SEE IF THEY WOULD REPLACE IT .
5,exceptional bit of history,"this movie shows how a small group of soldiers saved the lippizans from extinction. the show ofthe horses various abilities was very good, perhaps i should say excellent"
4,My sister is a happy camper,"My sister and I always talk about old movies; especially Disneys. She really wanted this film, and I hadn't checked for a couple of years to see if it was available on DVD. When I saw it was available, I quickly ordered it for her - she was so happy to receive it, she watched it immediately."
4,Miracle of the White Stallions,dvd worked fine and I have always loved the story. Have had the VHS tape for years. DVD quality really brings it to life.
3,Pretty good,Pretty good film of a courageous story. Dated of course but told the story of how the world did not lose these important horses.
5,wonderful story,"I first saw this movie at a theater when I was a teenager. Recently I took my nieces to see the descendants of the white stallions live. I tried to rent the movie so they could understand the history of the horses, but I could not find one in my town. I didn't think I could find one, I was very happy to find one on Amazon.com. This is such a wonderful story of how dedicated people can save a piece of history. We should not forget how devastating war can be on the innocent animals and people."
4,Miracle of the White Stallions,"I had known of the Lipizzaner stallions story for years, and even already had the video. My husband took me to see the Lipizzaner stallions perform recently for the first time, and I fell in love with them all over again. I decided it was time to up-grade from a video to a DVD. We watched it as soon as it arrived. It is an amazing story of devotion and heroism, and I recommend it to anyone who doesn't think everything has to be widescreen,Miracle of the White StallionsBlu-ray or Hi-def to be worth watching."
1,Miracle of the White Stallions,"""Don't give a hoot about Joe Public"" seems to be the mantra these days at Disney when it excitedly releases classics on DVD.Why don't they take a little more care and issue these films in widescreen format in the way they were supposed to be seen. Its just another way the public has been hoodwinked by a greedy mouse. I wouldn't purchase any of these ""new"" re-releases until they put product of an acceptable - as opposed to half-assed - quality. Shame on you!"
1,Tu adolescente y el SIDA,"El libro ""Tu adolescente y el SIDA"" es un arma del agenda mundial de promover el sexo entre adolescentes bajo el pretexto de ""sexo seguro.""En vez de recomendarle al adolescente que se dedique a sus estudios y que evite la vida sexual activa que ya se promueve en todas partes, este libro recomienda el uso de condones para evitar las enfermedades, entre ellas el SIDA, letales. Los estudios muestran que los programas que recomiendan el uso de condones para evitar el SIDA simplemente no funcionan porque a la larga, las personas sexualmente activas dejan de usarlos y siguen en el sexo promíscuo que los pone en contacto con sidosos.No hay nada como la abstinencia pero el autor ni la menciona.Este libro lleva un mensaje sumamente peligroso."
1,wack,man i aint pay to see ppl play wit them selves i paid to see some cheeks to get beat an whee was the monaing terrible just terrible
3,Do the Job,"Tis the old addage you receive in proportion the amount you spend. This wrench I wouldnt put up against a Craftsmn, but for the limited use I will show it, the product should work acceptably. The spine, shaft, in my opinion is thin. If torquing while holding this shaft, gloves would be my choice. Now own two of these products, both china shiny right outta the box, what else you expect for $10, longevity?"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,This CD-ROM has nothing to do with the ocean. The sounds are from someone sitting in a bathtub playing in the water. It is 66 minutes and 12 seconds of bathwater splashing.
1,Oh horrid,Thank GOD I didn't buy this CD but borrowed it from the library. What a crock! It's so awful that I just had to come to Amazon.com to warn anybody who would even think of getting this!It is totally true: it's someone splashing around in a freaking bathtub!
1,This Sucks,The person above me is right: it sounds like someone set their kid in the bathtub and thought they could make some money off of it. This is not even close to sounding like a real ocean surf. I've pulled more realistic sounding ocean waves out of my a$$ in a swimming pool.
4,A good map,"A very high quality map of Jasper. It is not really necessary if you are not going to stray from the roads or the main, well marked, trails - but it is nice to have for identifying landmarks."
4,Sauder Pedestal 2-drawer File Cabnets 401444,"Good quality for the price, nice finish color, easy to assemble. A good value for the price--very functional and looks nice."
5,"Attractive, does the job","Arrived quickly, easy to assemble. Attractive color, fits well with home desk. Drawers open smoothly, easy to roll on hardwood floors. (Haven't tried it on a rug.) Designed to have one drawer open at a time. Standard hanging files fit well. Nice Handles."
2,don't waste your time or money...,"I bought this book because I'm from northern Minnesota and thought it would be interesting, perhaps even clever and funny. Instead I found it unoriginal, poorly written, poorly edited, and not entertaining in the least. Furthermore, it bears little or no resemblance to the region other than place names."
4,Pretty Fire,It was an interesting look at serious events through the innocent eyes of a child. All performed by one woman.
1,disappointing,This is very disappointing product.1. the whistling part was broken in a day!2. the handle is just fixed and can't be moved. So uneasy to use and clean.
2,Not impressed,"Looks like I might have to do some repair on the whistler...- just doesn't work right. Also the lever on the handle that opens the pour spout/whistler is very stiff to operate. Glad it was on sale but I should have looked elsewhere, too."
4,its a tea kettle,quite sturdy and has great volume. The wife and I have about 8 cups of tea each morning and there is plenty of water left over. We got this to replace a 1 quart kettle and I'm happy with the size. Others have complained about the whistle but we never heat it that high so its not a problem for us. I drilled a hole in the side and put a cheap thermometer in there and heat the water to the temperature that we desire.
3,Pretty good for the price -- Not great,"For $19.99, this isn't a bad tea kettle. I would, however, consider going with something a few dollars more expensive.The kettle has a very wide base, which seems to help in heating quickly, however the metal is so thin I'm not convinced it's conducting the heat very well.Additionally, the handle (plastic) seems to get quite hot. I'm not sure if this is normal or not.The spout is somewhat clunky to open, however it seems to whistle reasonably well.I'm happy with my purchase, for the price, but i'm considering finding a more expensive tea pot in the future. I don't expect this one will last too long."
2,Doesn't Last - Self-Destructing,"I've used this teakettle every day for a few months. First the inside was just corroding away, even with rinsing and emptying. Then, the whistle stopped working. Then the handle cracked. That was it. Threw it out. I guess I got my money's worth, but it's not one to last any length of time at all."
1,Avoid this kettle,"I am on Amazon today shopping for a new kettle after owning this one only a few short months. The spout cover is already broken so I get no whistle. Plus, I have never liked the handle. You have to practically contort your whole body sideways to pour it. Going back to Revere!"
3,Whistle broken after six months,"It's a kettle so I really only care that I can fill it with water and put it on the stove to boil, but it's annoying to have a metal piece fall off from underneath the sprout cover after only about six months. It shows either subpar design or shoddy workmanship, perhaps both. Other than that the kettle's exterior looks nice and since the handle is fixed upright and the lid is a bit hard to pull off, I just tilt the sprout up to the faucet to fill the kettle."
4,Inexpensive and inoffensive,"I've been using this for several months now and am reasonably pleased with the purchase. I wasn't expecting perfection, after all, for a $15 sale item. The kettle is lightweight, the space between the top and the handle is wide and tall, making it easy to use with most faucet/filter attachments, and I like that the lid is completely removable. The kettle heats water extremely quickly in comparison to the Revere copper-bottom I had previously. The only downside is that the handle gets a bit warm when heating. So far, this has not been so hot as to require a pot holder, but I suspect if one were to leave it on high heat boiling for a length of time, it would become extremely hot (I normally remove the kettle from heat the moment the whistle sounds..)."
5,BEST TEAPOT EVER,"Let me be brief. I drink tea....I mean I drink it everyday. I have had many teapots/kettles both expensive and cheap. This is the best one that I have ever owned. It doesn't get too hot, it pours wonderfully and the size is just perfect. Stop looking and buy this one!"
4,good design - a little thin though,"i really like the design and the usability of this teakettle. it fits enough water for even bigger tea pots, has a lid to fill in the water and has a nice handling. the whistle is ok too. one note to the electric stove users (as me): the bottom is very thin and already slightly bulged. on the other hand it is even so thin that when you fill the kettle all the way up it straightens out the bottom. decide yourself if you are ok with that. on the positive side are still the nice design and a reasonable price ($40 would be a joke though)."
4,Classic Teakettle,"Great Product. I would have preferred brushed stainless versus shiny, but that is a preference that does not affect product use. It's a little cumbersome to open and close the spout (many prodcuts have a more ""user friendly"" mechanism). In general, a good product."
3,Loved it 'till I burned it! Whistle not loud enough.,"I have only had the pot for a little over a month. I was boiling a little water and went upstairs to check on the baby(located 5 steps up to the side of the kitchen) and forgot about the pot on the stove. Needless to say the pot turned a light shade of bronze after the water boiled off. I really did not hear the whistle go off. The pot that I had replaced was very loud.Overall, the Farberware Tiburon pot is nice ...easy to fill, pretty stainless look, and has an attractive shape. I would like to buy another one except that it still has the same quiet whistle. Still a good deal if you are extra careful!!"
4,Great value,"I've bought many kettles in the past, and I like this one the best. The handles are not hot, the whistle is loud enough, and the stainless great. I think it's a good product for the price."
3,Would be Great if the Whistle Worked,"Cheaper than others by leaps & bounds, heats quickly, pours without spilling, and lasts forever. Unfortunately, the whistle has never worked and at least twice it's been boiled dry which leaves a buildup of sediment on the inside."
3,Teakettle by Farberware,"I wanted a teapot that did not require using a potholder on the handle once the water was boiling. If you use a gas stove and turn it on High to boil the water, you will need to use a potholder. The only way you do not need a potholder is to heat the water at less than the High setting."
2,Avoid this one. Clumsy design.,Recommend avoiding this model because of these clumsy design features:- Difficult to take the lid off because the handle is too tall.- Too small a lid making it difficult to clean.- Awkward operation of the spout cover.I wish I had taken the negative comments of other reviewers seriously.
2,Good looking but not whistling,I bought this kettle from Aamzon because the good reviews on this product. This kettle look good to me. But it doesn't whistle after about just one week. So I need to check it very often when I use it. I planed to return it but can't find the box with UPC code.
5,Stainless Steel Tea Kettle,"Cute. Functional. Classic. What's not to love? If you are looking for a basic teakettle, I don't think you'll be disappointed."
4,Cheap and effective,"I chose this kettle because it was the cheapest one I could find. I'm thrilled with the price..., and it boils water just fine on my gas stove, with a standard whistle when the water is ready.The only issues I have are that I have to wipe it down more often than I'd like (I'm lazy, and the shiny surface shows dirt), and that the handle isn't the most ergonomic. But for under [$], I'm happy."
1,Poor Quality,Farberware made in China. The thinnest stainless steel i've ever seen. I ordered a 1 quart Farberware pot at the same time and it was both made in the good old USA and was made with high quality materials - heavy duty stainless steel with thick aluminum bottom. DON'T BUY THIS TEAPOT!!
2,Whistle Pops Off Kettle,"This tea kettle is nice looking and the perfect size for me, plus the price was good, but when I go to pour water after the kettle starts whistling, about half the time the whistle and spring mechanism fly off the kettle when I push down on the lever. It happened the first time I used it! If that didn't happen, I would give the tea kettle at least 4 stars instead of 2."
4,Pretty good pot for the price,Read other reviews and this looked like a bargain tea pot for the price. No problems what so ever.
4,Good for the money.,Bought this recently and it works OK. The whistle is very loud initially but does drop get quieter after a few seconds. Happy with my purchase overall.
3,Satisfactory!,"Convinient kettle ,doesn't weigh much..whistle is tolerable ...handle is comfortable ...won't have the trouble with spout once u start using it,maybe after a couple of times...the lid is a little flimsy,but the opening is sufficient enough for people with small hands and a small O-Cello soft spunge scrubber gets in easily...on the whole a satisfactory purachase which is worth its price."
1,Do not buy this!,"I was so discouraged. The product that was shipped to me was NOT new. Inside did have clear marks and stains with heated water lines. Also had some black paste-like spots which I have no idea about. Do not buy this, if you want a new one."
5,The best,"This is the second one I've owned after my husband overheated the first one and ruined it (and I mean serious overheating, not just a little). Couldn't find another kettle I'd rather own. Excellent."
1,museken,"This kettle was the worst kettle we ever owned. The handle got super hot. The plastic broke. The biggest thing is this kettle took for ever to heat up. In the morning you want to get out the door. This kettle would start to boil by the time you got to work. One thing, get a kettle with a copper bottom I'm not going to name any products in this review but Paul Revere was a great hero of mine. I love tea. For those that don't really understand copper is a great conductor, thats why its in the wire in your home. Heat and electricity are both forms of energy what would you want boiling your tea stainless steel...HA! No Way!"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT IF YOU WANT WHISTLING,"I bought this kettle from Amazon.com because it had a whistle. The whistle worked a little for the first time, but then it completely stopped. The design is nice, and the spout works fine, but if you want to have a kettle which whistles, don't buy it. You will be disappointed like me..."
4,Faberware Classic Tiburon Tea Kettle,"I stopped shy of giving this a 5-star review because I have not owned it for very long. But so far it's been great, you just have to be careful not to overfill it or the boiling water will splash out when you lift the whistle to pour. Speaking of the whistle, it's a loud, urgent sound that compels you to get the kettle off the burner as soon as possible!! The size (2 1/2 quart) was exactly what I was looking for and the price was unbeatable! In looking through retail stores, it was difficult to find this size for under $50. It's not as eye-catching as some of those more expensive kettles but it met all of my other ""wants"" and it is used daily...so far with no problems!"
2,tea kettel,the tea pot does not whissel good the tea pot is ok not that grate if you whant one that can whissel loud
1,total junk!!,Don't buy this.Cute and that's it! The whistle part fell off on first use. The handle gets hot. And the lever to open the spout is in wrong direction.
1,Broke after one use,I went to use it and the whistle mechanism flew off across the room. I was so disappointed because I loved the shape.
2,Whistle breaks,We've had two of these in the past 2 years. Both times the whistle broke. Won't buy another because the same problem presents in a short period of use.
2,2 1/2 quart whistling tea kettle,This tea kettle has such a large handle it is hard to get your finger on the trigger. Also the trigger is hard to push to open spout.
4,4.5 stars Excellent quality,"This kettle is attractive and likely to be of lasting quality. I've had no trouble using it on my flat glass electric stove, and it is easy to clean.update 1 year later: It still works and looks like new. Zero problems."
1,Safety Issues,"I've never written a review of a product before, but this one poses a safety hazard. The first time that I used the kettle, the metal piece that causes the kettle to whistle flew off when I opened the spout. So the super-heated disc flies across the kitchen every time I use it. Quite simply, this kettle is a piece of junk. Don't risk burning your fingers or someone else's--buy a different kettle. This one's going into the trash."
2,nothing special,"I paid $19.99 for this kettle in July 2009. The first time it was used to boil water, the spring which comes as part of the whistle-lifting mechanism fell off. The whistle sound is neither soft nor loud. It's not much of a whistle (imagine a person with no teeth whistling). Pouring water into this thing isn't convenient. I expected better quality especially since the retail price is quite high. There are better kettles in this price range."
1,Not as good as the reviews,Can you believe it? The opening of the kettle dropped off within two days of usage.How can this item deserve any stars?
5,Great Kettle,I haven't had a tea kettle in a long time. This is the one I chose to get and I love it. It's not heavy and I like the way the handle is made. My husband even likes it.
2,Cutest teapot but mine burned,"I was looking forward to using this teapot. It was the perfect size and had an adorable bell shape. I did read the reviews of the low whistle sound but decided to try it b/c it was such a cheap deal at the time...Well, needless to say that I burned the pot after the second use b/c I did not hear the whistle. My other teapot, a stainless steel... is really loud. But I liked the Tiburon for the heat resistant handle. Anyway, I did not get enough use out of it even at the bargain price. I give it 4 stars for style, handle, and the prop up spout but 2 stars b/c of the poor whistle that led to it's very short life..."
5,"Want to learn combustion, just grab this book","Well i was the first time user to Discreet combustion when i purchased this book and i found it very useful as a starter to the software. This book starts with the chapter to set preferences in the software and then the interface in depth, later on this book will make you understand the main operators of combustion (Particles, paint, text, edit, composite) quite easily, though all the operators are not discussed in the book such as channels, RE vision plugins used for morphing. Gary Davis knows where u can make mistakes and he pointed out that quite well. I found it ""easy to follow"" kind of book. If anyone who has passed the intermediate level of combustion and advancing to higher level then they should not opt for this book, as this book lacks in profesional techniques kind of theory. Overall this book is designed for Beginers and people at intermediate level of the software. I recommened this book 100%."
5,A Classic,"This is a classic book for the beginner-intermediate level player. It is to the point and clarifies obscure/essential concepts. I have been playing Go for several years, read a number of books, and this book helped immensely."
3,Interesting as a rarely heard opera,"Although this opera contains some nice music, It isn't a great opera. It was well performed and I found it interesting to hear an opera by Schubert. I would only recommend it for someone who has most of the standard operas and wants to impress friends by having an opera they have probably never heard of."
5,What an incredible read!!!!!!!,"Ms. Wells has a thorough command of her universe. She skillfully threads the reader through the streets, alleys and catacombs of her world. The ""people"" in her story are diverse, very interesting and very fallible. The only regret I have is that I finished the book too damn fast! I wanted it to last longer but I couldn't put it down!"
4,A great romp.,"Nicely drawn world -- love the 19th century + magic setting. Valiarde is a bit cardboardy, standard Stiff Upper Lip Gentleman Thief Male Lead type, but the supporting cast is excellently drawn -- the characterization just didn't spread to the protagonist for some reason.An improvement over City of Bones (which was also fun, but with weaker technique) -- I'll be keeping an eye out for future Wells books."
4,Well...,"This book was good, but not it didn't strike me the way Ms. Wells' other two books did. The characters don't seem as real. With Khat and Thomas, I could imagine them as real people. Nicolas seems a bit stiff and cardboardy to me, too. The only character that really got to me was Arisilde, but he (nor anyone else) was given the chance to really be developed. And as a personal preference, I prefer fayres to necromancy. So maybe that's why this book didn't seem as good to me as its 'prequel,' The Element of Fire. I didn't think it was as good as the completely different City of Bones, either. A good read, but not as special as previous books."
3,Too much description,"This author writes well and the book is mildly entertaining, but there is w a a y too much description. Is it there to pad the book? Please see below.""Madeline wore a plain dark dress with a white apron and had tucked all her hair away under a white cap. She had skillfully used makeup to change the long lines of her face from elegant to gaunt and to narrow her wide dark eyes.""""Heavy damask draperies of pale yellow framed the windows, matching the ivory silk panelled walls and the cushions and covers on the couches, overstuffed chairs; and the delicate little tables. The bed hangings made up for this restraint with embroidered garlands, silk blooms, and a crown of ostrich feathers.""The book is going back."
4,Tons o Fun!!!,"I loved reading this book - a great combination of fantasy, mystery, history, romance - i loved the entire cast of characters. I love reading ""team"" books, and this team, led by Nicholas Valiarde, is one of the best. Fantays is my favorite genre, and this was a great and unique spin on that genre. I'm going to check out the rest of Martha Wells' books, and i would love to read any further exploits that Nick and his merry men and women get themselves into!!!!"
5,Night Prophecies,This book was one of those you don't want to put down until the end. I just couldn't wait to see what the secret was. I'm sure you'll find it as interesting as I did.
5,"""NIGHT PROPHECIES, A Must Have For Readers""","What an exciting suspense novel! It was gripping from page one, and it held my attention until the end. I couldn't stop reading this book...from the intensity of the tragedies, to the Powerful message of Faith, Hope and Love, to the mind blowing ending. THIS NEEDS TO BE MADE INTO A MOVIE...HOLLYWOOD, ARE YOU LISTENING AND PAYING ATTENTION. I recommend this novel to one and all, please give this book a chance. I promise you won't be disappointed."
4,service manual,"Good delivery, covers so many models that it has diagrahms for models that didn't help me. Other wise has some really good info."
1,Not to me,"I had some major problems with it. I love the X-Files and I had huge expectations for this game. I was also excited that you could finish the game with both Mulder and Scully probably adding to the game's replay value. The story also appeared to be loyal to the show. I add an extra star only for the game's desire to be entertaining at most.The worst problem was the cheap graphics. You only have to compare it to any Silent Hill games to know how bad the graphics of X-Files were. Most of the times, I tolerate poor graphics if the game is intriguing enough, but that never happened. Frankly, I couldn't believe the zombie on wheels. I can't believe that was the best they could come up with after a long list of bizarre monsters filed up after so many X-Files seasons. This wasn't the X-Files. This was just another videogame.But I had to pass the first stage at least. Couldn't give up so easily. What I saw terrified me. I had never witnessed a Playstation game with Nintendo graphics."
2,Lame,"Beware of any new video game that is discounted from the typical $49.99 pricing. This game had so much potential, but the poor camera angles, the slow game play and the ripoff of Resident Evil makes this game a huge disappointment for this avid gamer and X-File fan and the only reason I gave this game two stars is because of the voice talents of Gillian and David."
5,Great way to still have fun with Mulder and Scully!,"I am not your usual ""gamer"", but was sooooo glad I had previously bought my son a Playstation 2 so that I could get and enjoy this game! Now that the series is over, and we are all waiting for another movie, there is a great way to still enjoy our favorite FBI agents! The game was difficult in some spots for me (really makes you think about the clues), but even someone like me can maneuver through and get through the game. Having the game played through Mulder's point if view and then again through Scully's point of view was a neat addition to the fun. THIS GAME IS A MUST-HAVE FOR ANY SERIOUS X-PHILE!!!! I would not hesitate to recommend it to any player of any age!"
4,Fun Game,I think this is a really fun game. It's like Resident Evil. It does have some problems like lots of loading screens. I guess I have the patients for all of these loading screens. Sometimes there's problems with the camera angle after it loads and you get confused where you are and you end up going back where you where and have to wait for it to load again. It's hard to control your character when the camera angle changes. It would be nice if I could use the directional buttons rather than the analog stick for moving. With all of these problems it still a fun game.
4,coolest survival horror game story,if only Silent Hill 3 could have had as excellent of a story and star power as X Files Resist or Serve. It is probably the coolest storyline in a survival horror platform that i have ever experienced. I will admit that the camera angles for each area never switch wether you are running toward the screen or away and can make it very difficult to play at times.
5,I has teh 1337 karate moves! w00t,"I think it's a fun game.. xD In my opinion the graphics are very good and I think it's pretty neat that you can choose between Mulder and Scully as being your main character of the story. Overall it's very creative, though the first episode kinda reminds me of parasite eve or something (*cough* I've never played that game but I remember seeing trailers for it way back when). Yeah but still.. It's fun kicking zombie-butt..! Literally sometimes. ^^;I especially recommend this game for all ze wonderful X-Philes out there who happen to own a PS2. =D It's fuuuuun..."
4,Better than the last game,"I got this game as a gift and wasn't sure if I'd like it or not. Let's face it, licensed games are notoriously bad (need I mention Enter the Matrix?). And, while this game is no work of survival horror gaming art, like Fatal Frame or Clock Tower, it is a helluva lot of fun. If you loved the show, especially in the early years, go ahead and pick it up.And kudos to Fox Interactive for publishing really good titles based on their licenses, such as the two Buffy games and Simpsons Hit n' Run. Just please, please, please don't make a Married with Children game. Thanks!"
4,More than words can say,"a good read, much information. Mr Goldberg offers reviews of the day and the reviewers were really harsh at times. With all the bad press the group got I wondered how they stayed popular for so long. Nothing changes. Reviewers review and fans enjoy. The book is an easy read, broken down by year, detailing Egos clashing, members coming and going, It wasn't all peaches and cream. Contains a very fine discography. Glad to have it on my book shelf. This is trusted reference material."
2,ehhh,"It is a big, red, USMC flag, (one star)inexpensive & fast shipping (second star) and at the time the best available on Amazon for purchase. However was thin, so thin in fact where it was folded it was already tearing on the creases and had 2 little holes, and is see-through, and when the wind blows the other way you see the other side backwards. Bought from the same supplier the annin-nyl American flag and it's great-heavy thick embroidered. I would have gladly paid the same price as the American flag for a thicker version of the USMC flag. I'm sure I could have sent it back but son is deploying and wanted the flags in front of the house."
4,Great Flag,Great way to show your Marine Corps pride. Good material but would only use it for indoor use only. It wouldnt hold up well outside.
2,Extremely Mis-cut,"The flag was very thin and had a cheap screen print of the Globe & Anchor on only one side. The worst thing about the flag though was that the bottom right corner stuck out at least 2 inches farther than the rest of the flag. It was very unsquare. I reckon it could be cut and resown but I shouldn't have to do that, they should have cut it right in the first place."
3,It is a bit weak.,"I have been flying it since I got it a year ago. Wish the material was a bit stronger, and that it was double sided. Other than that it is a okay buy for what I paid for it. It would work better as a tapestry rather than a flag."
5,merry xmas,"thank you,the flag finally got here.i wanted to say thank you its beautiful.my son is gonna love it.have a merry xmas"
1,BUYER BEWARE,"please do not go by the reviews listed on this product page ... even tho i only paid 78 cents for this flag, it really is worth about that much ... I am ashamed to have bought it as a gift for my 80 year old marine corp veteran father ... many of the reviews listed on this product page state that it is double sided ... is embroidered ... and is beautiful ... it is NONE of these ... BUYER BEWARE !!!!"
2,"Not bad for the price, but the eagle looks funny","The material is okay, but it definitely looks cheap, and I'm not hanging it because the eagle just doesn't look right. I'll try to put up a picture when I can."
2,product as advertised but.....,"Seller seems to be oblivious to the buyers good faith in them. So I buy a flag, and it tells me that it will take over a week to arrive....well ok, so I wait 2 weeks and they tell me that UPS jacked up the order, not them. They then tell me that they will send out another flag with tracking so I can account for the package. Why do I have to account for your package? It finally arrives, and I ask for expedited shipping and the told me no, they can't authorize that because I didn't rate it. Well, about the only good thing from this company is the customer service peeps answered my emails promptly."
1,Horrible and dissappointded,"Does anyone sell a decent flag anymore? This was the second time I tried ordering a replacement usmc flag that we fly everyday. Our last one lasted over a year. The add was misrepresented, it was supposed to be double sided print. It was Not, and paper thin. Might be ok if you're hanging on wall, but not to actually use. Very disappointed, not worth sending back to pay shipping and handling charges. I guess I need to physically see what I'm buying the next round. Beware."
2,UGHH Upset,I ordered this for my dad for fathers day on here it says its a united states marine corps flag but i got one that says united states marine corps retired and thats not what i wanted!
5,Marine Flag,These flags were beautiful and very well made. I was a little dissapointed to see that they were made in China.
1,Wrong item cheap material,"I received the flag for the state of Florida. Needless to say I am disappointed. Furthermore the quality of the material is thin and cheap. I would not recommend if you are looking for a more durable flag, let alone the one you order."
3,flag,not bad for the price pretty thin does not hold up in very windy areas bought multi flags because they didnt look like they would last long
5,USMC Flag,We were very pleased with the flag for the cost it was a very nice flag. we had been looking for a flag for some time and the cost no s&h and was delivered in a reasonable time
1,Extremely Poor Quality and Misleading,"First off, this flag did not come as advertised -- it's not embroidered or double-sided. Quite frankly I feel cheated. This is not what I paid for. The stitching was already loose when I opened the package, the material itself is ultra thin, and just all around poor quality. BEWARE."
4,Good book,"An easy read, from a good author, with great stories. Enjoyable and fun, enjoy her column in the local newspaper"
4,Wonderful essays,"Wonderful essays about family life, with its births and deaths, the marriages and divorces, and the children growing up and leaving home. I recommend this book."
2,Forgetable? Yes,"If you like cheap and cheesy sword and sandal epics then you love this. If you do not then it is as chessy as Italian pizza. Hercules (Vardis) has to rescue a princess from an evil witch and her evil son. Hercules rescues the princess and the baddies die. Complete with ultra cheap stunts and effects which make a school play look like star wars. It is also dubbed. Also the video quality is not so good, it goes a bit off pitch at times. But I like the 60`s fashion statements."
2,Not what I expected,"As a Trekie I wanted this as a desk toy. Sadly it is not quite what is claimed. The saucer section is plastic, not die cast, and the whole thing is a dark gray color with little white squares all over it. Maybe my TV doesn't work right, but the Enterprise-D always looked to be white to me"
1,RIP OFF,So i ordered these on Halloween and its now December 14th and i never got them...I tried to contact the seller but they didnt respond..DONT DO BUSINESS WITH!!!!
1,"AWFUL FRUIT SLICES WITH NO FLAVOR WHATSOEVER!!!,",THESE ARE SOME OF THE WORST FRUIT SLICES CANDY I HAVE EVER EATEN IN MY LIFE!!! THESE HAVE NO FLAVOR WHATSOEVER.....LIKE EATING PASTE.CANDY FRUIT SLICES ARE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A STRONG FLAVOR.........THESE BARELY HAVE ANY FLAVOR AT ALL...........TRUELY HORRIBLE!!!
1,Ouch!!!! Do not buy these shoes!!!,"I purchased these shoes a year ago - thinking they were sort of cool looking - especially after having loved a pair of Frye boots years ago. I am sorry to state that I have yet to wear them for longer than ten minutes. Last summer I wore them downstairs to greet guests and after settling them in with wine and appetizers, I promptly went back upstairs, removed them and put them back in their box to go nite-nite. I should have returned them. I tried putting them on again this summer and it is impossible to find any good reason to like these shoes. They are like little torture chambers for your feet. I might also mention that the ""natural"" color looks more like baby poop, as opposed to the nuevo leather color of Louis Vuitton purse straps, as depicted in the photos on Amazon. What a waste of money!"
3,cute but stiff,"Love the look, but won't wear often. The leather around the toes is very stiff and hurts when I walk....but they are still too cute to return. I will just wear them for sitting occasions only...Sofft shoes are still my favorite."
4,Works as expected.,"It's a mechanical A/V selector switch RCA cable connectors fit snugly and inside connection pass signal with no apparent degradation. Unit is heftier that others, a good thing."
5,Sima Does the Job Well,"Having had some success with the RCA Brand A/V selecor, I wanted and needed a reliable 4 input selector. The selector by Sima was reasonable in price, has an earphone jack and is reversable. It does the job and my only suggestion for improvement would be to have selector buttons light up or be color-coded so that the user could easily determine which input had been selected."
4,Works as it should,"I have a low-budget tube television with only 1 set of A/V inputs, and this device allows me to use DVD, VCR, X-Box, and a PC, all with the one input. It has very low interference, and looks great on each of the 4 inputs. I have a 5.1 receiver with A/V routing, but receivers tend to add a significant amount of fuzz/static. This is common with budget receivers, so I would recommend this as an upgrade from that specific application. This would work EXCELLENT as a video game switcher for older non-HD systems (gamecube, dreamcast, SNES, etc.)"
3,OK Switch,"This switch works OK, looks OK, and is easy to connect. The push-button switches however do not have a snap-action feel when pushed to give confidence that they are fully 'locked' in position. I find myself pushing on them more than once to be sure they are fully depressed. I rate this switch OK but there's room for improvement. Frank J Florida"
3,Didn't meet my needs.,I was hoping to find a selector unit where I could toggle between Hi-Fi and the audio from TV/Blueray. This wasn't it.
5,Very Good Selector,"I use this A/V Selector at our church. It freed up 3 other channels and it works flawlessly. I just use the audio portion of the selector, but I don't see why the video wouldn't work either.It doesn't require batteries, or need to be plugged in to electric.A+ in my book."
4,"works fine, just what I needed","I used it in the ""backwards"" mode mentioned by a previous reviewer: the switch connects one signal source (FIOS DVR)to destination A (my TV) or destination B (a device called ADS DVD Xpress that converts TV signal to USB format for computer). I like that the switch needs no power - I already have a jungle of power cords and ""wall warts"" for the TV, DVR, VCR, modulator (to convert VCR output to composite video), etc. This switch does not seem to noticeably degrade the audio or video signal quality."
4,Works as it should; Short Warranty,"I bought this to replace an ""automatic"" a/v selector made by NakiWorld that didn't work at all. This unit by Sima works as advertised, as another reviewer has said. However, the manufacturer's warranty is only 90 days, and this short period makes me wonder how long this product is expected to last. I hope it keeps working after a few months. I wish the manufacturer stood behind its product with a longer warranty. Then again, warranty repairs can be a bit of a hassle to set up, so that might not be a good metric for reliability.The product also comes with a surprisingly detailed instruction manual."
4,Good Switcher,"This product works as advertised. I use it in combination with a radio shack switch to change between TV input and computer input going out (through Radio Shack Switcher) to the computer speakers, to headphones, and to an additional output."
4,A Good Switch,I searched many places until I found this switch and I have not been disappointed. It is better built than any others that I looked at in stores and performs as it should. I recommend this switch as value for the cost.
1,"I have not, after 5 weeks received this item","so far I am not satisfied, So BAD, I have not received this item - Ippolita. What do you suggest I should say?"
3,QUALITY,"This product is probably satisfactory to someone that has not had a good quality tea kettle before. However I bought it to replace a much loved stainless tea kettle that was purchased at Costco many years back. It was simply discolored from burning over time and leaked a bit from an old washer seal.Anyhow, I purchased this tea kettle because it boasted quality and sleekness. Though it is satisfactory, I felt it was a disappointment in quality. The handle mechanisms are a hard cheaper form of plastic verses a nice soft rubber grip handle, and the stainless steel itself is not very sturdy quality like my older one. The top is a bit of a struggle to get off as well. I do not feel it was a good value for the price, however, for some it may be quite adequate."
3,OK,"Not my favorite piece as far as looks or weight, but fine for the everyday job we bought it for and for the price."
4,Almost perfect,"It seemed like I'd owned this kettle much longer but it's only been about 18 months.It's a good, sturdy kettle with a shrill whistle. I wanted a whistling kettle and that's exactly what I got.About three weeks ago something went wrong with the cap. It's as if a spring or whatever, that keeps the cap down is broken, so it doesnt whistle anymore unless I stuff something under the handle, behind that lever (if you'd call it that) to keep the cap closed. Otherwise I'd forget the darn thing was on the stove. It's whistling right now."
1,Weak Whistle,"I got this tea kettle because I was looking for one with a strong whistle so I can hear it from my office two rooms away from the kitchen. If I'm standing in my office feet away from the boiling pot, I am barely able to hear the whistle. I'm not sure if mine was defective or just the product had a poor whistle. Either way, I returned it shortly after buying it."
3,dissappointed,"Not the quality I hoped for -- and the ""whistle"" is more like a hiss than anything else"
2,You gotta have strong fingers for this kettle,"I don't know if I'll buy a tea kettle again online. I'm new to Amazon and probably should've read the reviews first. I just read a few about ""black goo""!? Uh oh, I didn't notice any black goo or particles. I did however notice that the little finger lever on the handle you need to pull to open the lid to pour your hot water is very hard to operate and you must have very strong fingers to open this thing. I have a hand like that of a young kid though and it is hard and annoying for me open this one. I am too annoyed to send it back and start over again. I make tea everyday multiple times a day and this is not ideal. Poops product. Other than that it's pretty good....but if you can't open it that good, that's really the whole thing! I'm wondering how long this lever is going to last, it barely opens for me now."
3,Meh...,"It's a nice kettle and it sings very loud. However, the spot is just too short. And when you are pouring very hot water you have to be careful not to spill. I will continue to use it but will likely replace it before its time is up."
2,Styling trumps ergonomics,"It does what it's supposed to do - it boils water, and it has a loud whistle. And Amazon's price is quite reasonable.But the handle isn't quite up to snuff. First, it gets hot, hot enough that I need a hotpad when it's been filled to the fill line. The finger latch also gets hot, and it's very awkward to operate with a hotpad.Second, when I'm pouring boiling water, holding the spout cover open with the finger latch, as I tip the kettle forward to pour out more and more water, the position of the spout moves UNDER my hand, so that hot steam rises and hits my hand. I'd move my hand further back on the handle, out of the way of the steam, but then I wouldn't be able to reach the finger latch to hold the spout open.Don't the people who design these things ever USE them???I'd return this, but, sad to say, its ergonomics aren't any worse than other, more expensive tea kettles that I've tried."
3,LIght weight tee pot,This item arived on time and was in good shape. Our only complaint is that is seems pretty light weight. It won't take long to burn through the bottom.
2,Disappointed!,"I really expected this to be a quality item but I am very much disappointed. It makes a funny noise the moment I turn on the heat to boil water and it ROARS and sputters water if I allow it to whistle, no matter how much water I put in it. There is a lip around the bottom of the kettle that collects black 'crud' and has to be cleaned on a regular basis. I would not recommend this kettle even though it has a nice appearance."
1,too hot to handle,"OK - so this isn't the worst kettle I've ever owned, but it has to be close.- The handle got too hot- The spout leaked- You burn your hand/finger trying to pull the spout opener backI threw mine away and got a more expensive but vastly superior Krups. Check it out and don't waste your money on this rubbish.Happy shopping.JB"
2,Arrived Defective,"I needed to purchase a basic, whistling teakettle. I chose a Farberware kettle because I had owned one previously and been very satisfied. Unfortunately, this kettle leaked lots of steam around the lid which I considered a safety hazard. The whistle was inaudible as well. The kettle was attractive and a good size, which earn it two stars. On the plus side, AMAZON furnished a postage-paid label for the return and credited my account promptly. I would not hesitate to order another teakettle from AMAZON."
4,Highly recommend,"My old Farberware stainless steel tea kettle lasted for over 25 years, but the plastic piece thatopens/closes the flapper finally broke...too small to glue. Thought I would miss that tea kettle,until I got THIS new Farberware one! I love that I can fill the kettle by removing a lid, no longerhave to hold & squeeze the flapper open, then line my faucet up to the little spout to fill! Onlyone slight negative (for me) is the squeeze-trigger that is used to pour water out is not ascomfortable for my hand/finger...especially with the on-set of arthritis. Still the pros outweightthe one little con!!."
1,Not Impressed,"This kettle looks very nice in my kitchen, however upon using it for the first time I burned my hand as the handle gets extremely hot. I now use a towel when pouring hot water for my tea, but I am incredibly unimpressed with this kettle and will soon buy another one that does not need a towel or pot holder when handling."
3,Good for the price,"The teakettle looks nice, is well-made, but the design of the handle and the trigger release for the spout make for an awkward pour. It will do for now."
4,Hard to Use,"This is such a very good tea kettle in every way Except that it's hard to use the lever to open the spout. I have to use two hands,so its impossible for my Mom to use. I would return it but I don't have the box anymore."
4,"Good tea pot, style and all but...","This large capacity teapot is goodd, however you have be careful using the handle, due to it primitive design leaving the hand prone to heat. I still think it's good but maybe the lifter mechanism could've been placed a litte further back."
1,hot handle,Handle gets way too hot. Tip of spout cover melted soon after purchase. Too difficult for my young teens to pull trigger on spout cover while pouring; fingers have to spread too far keeping spout open while pouring. Spouts and sprays water when too full and doesn't always whistle.
2,This tea kettle will rust !,"I've purchased 2 of these tea kettles. I purchased the first one at a discount store. When it rusted, I decided not to shop there anymore. So I looked at all the tea kettles at amazon.com, and this one really did have the look and design I wanted. So I purchased my second from Amazon, thinking the discount store had sold me a look-alike or defective kettle.However, now I am constantly fighting rust spots on this tea kettle too, and I know Amazon does not sell defective merchandise (except for this kettle)"
2,Bleaa,"Wasn't at all what I expected . . . Too much talk and not enough information that is helpful. I was needing more supportive thought in doing what ""I want to"" without being selfish and hurtful to others. Like . . . I can throw things at the door and cry, . . . or I can take the kids into the kitchen and work a puzzle. To not allow another person to control my actions. Although that is not the message in the book, that is where my heart went."
3,When I'm six,My children like the things Alexander plans to do to Anthony. But my 2 younger kids (4 and 3) do not understand that it is just day dreaming. They are also a bit confused that Alexander can do all these thing and still get away with it. The story is also a little too long. But for the older boy (6) this is a great book.
5,Great Book!,"Man, that Anthony thinks he's so great, well as soon as... uhh, the other kid in the book turns six things are gonna change. Hoooaah, he's going to make little anthony his little white faced reeces monkey! Exlamatory baby!"
3,Good for kids room,"I saw this online for $50 but got it at Wal-Greens for $30. Now I can NOT say they are the same thing but they look a hell of a lot a like.Best advise? Dont use them on the good stereo. These WILL work on any stero, iPod, computer,MP3 player, or even T.V. so long as there are head phones. BUT, the speakers are in the light show. So if you have system that is really good, dont use these. The speakers are not great.Another problem I had was that sometimes the music cuts out and I have to fiddel with the back connecting cord and that is a bum trip.But these would be cool for a kids room or as a gift for ur iPod loving family or friends. We LOVE anything compatable with our iPods!"
4,Great follow up.,"Banner of the Stars is the sequel to Crest of the Stars. Crest of the Stars chronicles the meeting of Jinto and Lafiel, Banner of the Stars reunites them and focuses on the actual war. There is plenty of action and exploration of emotions in this one. I think this is my favorite Crest of the Stars series. I have the first 3 installments and I have heard of a Banner of the Stars 3, but never seen it. Banner of the Stars 2 wraps it up pretty nicely though I think, so I'm not too worried about it. Anyway My only complaint is the animation. It's not much better than the stuff we saw in the 80's from anime like Robotech. It's obviously not that old, some of the special effects are pretty good. Like when they enter hyper space & stuff like that; but the character drawings are kinda rigid. The depth of the characters makes up for any other complaints one may have.I thoroughly enjoyed this anime and I think anyone could find something to love about it. Check it out."
4,Worth buying,I saw this mini series on tv around about 1987 (in the UK where I live). For some years I've wanted to have this in my collection (I already owned the paperback). I finally tracked down a website in Australia (previously hmv.com.au - now called sanity.com.au) & bought it. I'm glad I've got it at last. This is a quality production well acted & captures a piece of history (at least how it probably was). Worth buying!!
1,"Dear Playboy, Please fire all your editors","Typical Playboy nonsense. They've got the best looking women alright. There's no doubt about it. But they don't really want to let us get to see them. It's flashes and blurring and micro-second peeks... and black&white and all the other phony artistic side of the Playboy videos. When they somehow get it right, it's unbeatable (sorry) but don't look for it on thgis one."
5,Kitana Baker Is AWESOME,"Just having the hot Kitana Baker on this DVD makes it a great buy. I actually liked the home video she submitted herself the best, plus steamy bonus footage of her and another model going at it. A great buy with this is the DVD 'america's wildest bachelor parties.'"
4,sexy girls indeed,"this video tape is made of amateur sequences selected from thousands of tapes from girls eager to start a playboy model career.so picture quality is not always excellent,but this is highly overcomed by the quality of the models,among which the gorgeous kitana baker.Plus,the""hostess""in this 10 different playmate sequences is Deanna Brooks,a real cute one!worth the buying when you are already a fan of the playmates in question."
4,Dance CD,"This album is actually mostly dance music. My sister bought this CD cause she liked the songs they had in the charts, and while it had those songs on the CD nearly all the other songs are plain dance music, no words that is.I really like this CD cause im a dance music fan but if you think their gonna have more pop music on it then youve got another thing coming."
1,Ali as object of conspicuous consumption,"I revere Ali. I had the honor of meeting him for an author appearance for a previous photo essay book when I worked for a New York-based publisher. The Champion Edition at $10,000 and the cheaper edition at $3000 are antithetical to who the man is, or has been. He has always been a man of the people, and not a sycophant for the wealthy who buy books like they buy shares of Berkshire Hathaway. If there was any information about proceeds from the sale of the books benefitting someone other than the publishers and authors I would feel differently. As it is, this is just an opportunity for those who'd have sent him to jail for avoiding the draft to own him. I'd wager that they care less about what the man stands for than that they can now own something their friends can't afford. If you love Ali and have $3000 or $10,000 to spend, give to a charity in his name."
1,SKIP THIS AND BUY SOUL OF A BUTTERFLY OR FIND HAUSER'S MUHAMMED ALI HIS LIFE AND TIMES,"If you love Ali get his own SOul of A Buterfly or the other bio - if you can find it, as it really gest into the soul of this great man, and into his depp and abiding faith, which is a place no one any longer goes.Of course if any of the three thousand or twelve thousand DO get to Ali and his family it will make up in a SMALL way for all the millions managers and damagers stole form him, and will get distributed to good working charitable and humanitarian organizations that actually help people, as Ali gives it all away to those in need, unless Bush has declared him officially a funder of bad and dubious causesso if it goes to Ali, live large y'allsting like a bee"
4,This one will knock your socks off!,"Even books that have been on the market for quite some time still have that fire needed to keep you going through the night. And Weyrich is an example of that. Now, this is not your typical romance, but I think it's uniqueness may be what makes it all the more intriguing. Our heroine, Acte, goes through much before she finally meets Mr. Right, but the point is ladies, she does meet him. Take a trip to the library and look for this book, you wont be dissapointed, trust me."
2,"""Dynasty"" comes to ancient Rome","I don't know why I read this stuff- it's so BAD!!! But, I admit, it's bad in a terrifically juicy sort of way, so if that creams your twinkie, go for it."
2,Hercules vs. Incas?,"In this Italian sword and sandal picture, Hercules is transported to the New World, to fight some Indian guys who seem to be Incas or Aztecs or some such thing. He has to save the maiden who will be sacrificed by the evil king, of course.This beautifully unlikely premise, unfortunately, is undercut by the somewhat slow pacing of the film. The acting and sets are, well, what you'd expect in one of these films. Not one of the best in the series."
3,Mark Forrest this time as Hercules,"I enjoyed Goliath and the Dragon which Forrest (real name Lou Degni) made four years before this one. You can tell that the sword and sandal spaghetti films were winding down as the stories and sets were worse, not better.The story is rather silly and this film drags which is unfortunate because I am a fan of Degni aka Mark Forrest.I would recommend Goliath and the Dragon instead of this one for Degni and sword and sandal fans."
1,Only Look Good!,"O.K., they ""LOOK"" good. Their texture is spongy & just really weird. Could not eat them raw, as they tasted terrible and did not resemble any apple I'd ever eaten. (Grew Up in Michigan) I was totally disappointed, until my husband baked a pie with them. Their texture changed & the flavor did resemble apples, but I'll never order this brand again. Also, the lids were secured with the green shrink wrap, but once opened, the lids did not fit the containers! I should have trusted the previous terrible reviews. But, they ""LOOKED"" good."
1,"Poor Flavor, Leather Texture",Leathery texture. Tastes like the Apple flavoring is added in and not natural at all. Packaging date not made clear at all. I have had far better dried fruit.
4,Yummy,"As has been mentioned before, that seal on these needs a little work, one had opened in shipping. That being said, I love the apples and they make great dried apple pies."
1,Seals broken,Just like the other reviewer said the inner seal was broken for all but I dont think its totally because of shipping.
1,russia's abandoned children,"International adoption is a hot and relevent topic these days. Russia is a destination for many. So, any information about adopting from Russia and therefore its orphanage system, might be helpful and useful for those considering the country. However, this is not the book to offer any insight or educated, integrated, defensibly researched understanding of what you will be facing. Or even of what the book purports to explain. Unfortunately, this is a text compiled at about a B- grade level of a sophomore level research paper at a third tier university. Written by a diplomat's wife in collaboration with two others, I can almost see the disjointed quotes, on the index cards. Certainly not the ""pioneering work on child abandonment"" it purports to be."
1,Bought at thrift store and still a waste of money,"I picked this up because it's set in a ghost town, and I thought I would enjoy that setting. The setting is the only enjoyable thing about the book. It is the most poorly written published fiction--poorly written in every aspect--that I have read in years. Its worst flaw is that it continually violates what is possibly the first rule of fiction: show, don't tell. But there's more: the characters are cardboard, the dialogue is unbelievable, the descriptions are pedestrian.To top it off--though this is NOT the writer's fault--the cover depicts a ghost town in the desert, and the setting is actually in the California Gold Rush country."
1,An awful book,"I was in a hurry when I picked this book to read to my 2- and 4-year olds. The art work is nice and exciting but the text is awful. The kids in the book often hit the ""smart"" kid for his comments. I had to edit the text on the fly as my kids could get a little worked-up about hitting each other. Also, the environmental message is pretty shallow and doesn't really make much sense. They are on a river with sea turtles, dolphins and crocodiles. Huh?In a world of so many wonderful kids books, skip this one."
3,received in 3 weeks,"Interesting for me, but on a specific subject-matter that do not necessarily interest many people. The book was received in good conditions, but you can see that it has been read and consulted."
4,"great reading for someones, a brick in the bookshelf of others","It is a fundamental piece of work on the theoretical study of architecture and cities. The topic that Rossi documents and discusses is far from being concluded, which demonstrates the relevance of this publication edited for the first time about 40 years ago.I'd recommend this lecture to those involved in the formal study of architecture and urbanism, who might be looking for a solid theoretical basis towards the definition of a ""urban science"", or simply as a reference to understand the new ""urban artifacts"" (""urban facts"" would be a more accurate translation in my opinion) that occur in our days cities.As it has been mentioned, this is an excellent book, although I-would-not recommend it as a first approach to the subject. The topics are treated more with academic rigor than practical value, this might be disappointing to anyone who only wants a simple, easy-to-read book about cities and their construction."
3,Disapointing,"The poems are, as expected, very nice and clever,but the description of the book promises ""songs"",and I had hoped for some musical notation. Instead,it's just straight text. You could sing it if youwanted to, I guess, and if you already knew a songwith these lyrics, the book would be worthwhile, butnone of the songs I remember from my childhood wereincluded. I returned the book."
5,Just like I remember in Mom's kitchen.....,"If you like to put a pot of coffee on the stove, the old fashioned way, then this is a great pot for you. It makes a cup of coffee just the way you would like it to be."
3,Does what its suppose to do,The bottom is welded on leaving a crease on the inside which I can see becoming very yukky from buildup because you cant clean there. Would have been better if it was all one peice. The stem base is very thin so do not press to hard on the stem rod as it will bend and eventually break off. My stem rod was missing the spring
4,Good in a pinch,"Ordered this right after Hurricane sandy, if I lose power next time I can make coffee on the barbecue. A week after I ordered it, my drip coffee maker went kaput. Used this percolator for a week and it works well, if you like perked coffee."
5,Every coffee drinker's dream,"Wonderful product! I'm drinking my favorite coffee brewed today in this durable, easy-to-maintain, rugged perculator, which does not even need electricity in a power pinch or on a camp site. Sierra Club members take notice! LOLI chose to replace the plastic perculator top - where the perculating appears - with a glass version because of the heat-on-plastic issue, and Amazon was able to provide a followup link to a glass top which fit perfectly."
5,Great Percolator,"We've never had a percolator before, but decided to give this a try based on the good reviews. Love the fact that it's stainless steel, versus the plastic drip coffeemaker we had prior. Also, we lose power quite often where we live, so it's nice to still be able to make coffee on our gas stove.It's fairly easy to clean, and makes good coffee."
5,Wonderful coffee,"I love, love, love this pot. It makes the best coffee ever. I put my D&D grounds in it and it is better then when I go to D&D. However - it takes a while - you cannot turn the flame up real high - I use about 6 heaping tsp. of coffee. If you have never used a Percolator you need to experiment. Some work mornings I actually get up early just so I can brew this coffee - after I have my 2 cups I take a thermos to work. Mostly I just do it on the weekends because it takes about 15 minutes and I don't want to not keep an eye on it."
2,Disappointed in Farberware,"Of course, Farberware outsources its products like everyone else does, so this is a Chinese-made item. We were happy with it for two years, which is why I give it two stars instead of one. Still, I would once have expected a near-lifetime of use from a Farberware product.The handle is not bolted or screwed to the body in any way, although there is a bogus bolt there to persuade you otherwise. The handle is held on with four tiny spot-welds, which started to wiggle loose after a few months. One morning, the handle just gave way (in a luckily non-tragic way) when the last couple of welds let loose.The plastic bubble on top, that other people have had trouble with, was fine for the useable lifespan (two years).Now, while we're shopping for a replacement, my wife suits up in asbestos pajamas to pour scalding coffee from a handleless pot. Not cool, Farberware. Not cool."
2,Coffe Pot,I love using a stove top coffe pot rather than the new coffe makers. Unfortunately they are becoming increasingly harder to find. The faberware pots that I purchased (2) both have clear plastic knobs on top. After several uses the threads on the knobs become deformed making it impossible to keep them tight any longer. The old fashioned glass knobs were much better. Also I have been unable to find a site where replacement knobs may be purchased.
2,Stovetop coffeepot,"Because of the light gauge of the pot, it doesn't hold heat well, so after the first cup, it has to be reheated. The plastic see through top will not stay tight and after about a week of re-tightening, will not tighten at all, allowing coffee to come out of it when pouring."
4,"Good Coffee, plastic percolator top breaks","Like many other reviewers, I found that after a month of daily use, the plastic percolator top no longer fits securely in the lid and needs to be replaced. If it was glass, as advertised, this wouldn't be a problem. The coffee is great, and the percolator is easy to use, though requires you to monitor to prevent boil over. Same amount of time to make coffee as a drip, but can't just set and forget. I had already ordered a replacement glass top (through Amazon) at the same time as the coffee pot, but it's not as attractive, doesn't fit exactly like the plastic one and it ended up costing another $7.00 with postage."
5,Classic Stainless Coffee Pot,"Have looked at many styles and this is tops. Love the quality, balance, and look of the coffee pot. If you are looking for a traditional percolator, this is the one for you. Bought 3 of them ~ two for us and one as gift. You won't be disappointed."
2,A workhorse of a coffee pot,"A well made no frills percolator. It packs well,is quite simple to use and makes a great cup of coffee. The ideal coffee pot for camping or outdoor use. A superior product compared to the many flimsy coffee pots made for campers."
4,Farberware Percolator,"I really am enjoying my percolator, except the little nub on the glass top broke off so it won't screw on and stay in place. When I pour my coffee I have to hold the glass top in place for fear it will land in my coffee cup. I'm still wondering what happened to the little glass piece. However, it does make a GREAT cup of coffee!"
1,You Do Not Want To Purchase,"It was fine until the top broke off - the black ring around the top broke within two weeks of purchase. Also, the basket slits get stopped up quickly. Unlike the ""old fashion"" baskets which have round holes."
2,Farberware Perculator,"Everything about it is good . . . EXCEPT - - - The clear plastic cap is JUNK. It should be glass and is already stripped. We have had to improvise by using aluminum foil to hold it in place.Why would anyone make a product out of Stainless Steel and use a JUNKY plastice part for a critical item ?It makes excellent coffee but our friends thinks its CHEAP JUNK when they see the foil inserted in the top.If the top piece were glass, we'd rate it 5-Star"
1,Perked Off,"There's only one thing I like about this coffee pot, the lid stays on nice and snug and coffee doesn't leak all over my burner/camp stove like my previous two pots did. Three reasons I don't like it: (1) I can barely read the water measurement marks on the inside of the pot and it is therefore very hard to fill, (2) there are lips on the inside top and bottom of the pot and after washing it, it never completely dries out and a few grounds are always left stuck inside the bottom lip, and (3) it has a plastic cap on top and I would prefer glass."
5,Percolator Coffee Pot,"As soon as I received the coffee pot, I washed it and did a test run. I am happy to report that the coffee flavor was much better than my existing Cuisinart coffee maker. Just followed the directions and the flavor was so full. I believe the percolating process renders a fuller flavor than the drip of the my old coffee maker. I would highly recommend this product."
4,tap,"I forgot what perked coffeesmelled like on the stove.It is hotter than the drippot I have, easy clean up,no filters, A good buy."
4,hottest coffee you've had in a long time,"If you like hot coffee, well brewed...go back to the old fashioned percolator. Just bought this as a gift for a family member coffee hasn't tasted this good in a long time."
5,Excellent,This is a perfect coffee maker. No electronics to quit at the worst time. Perculates perfectly and I love the stainless steel. No filters to buy and to brew a perfect cup is all in the timing. 7 minutes of brewing is all it takes.
5,Faberware Coffee Pot,I am extremely happy with this purchase. Shipping time was quick from date of purchase. I've always used an on the stove top coffee pot and was happy to see I was able to get what I was looking for here. I would recommend this item to anyone who is looking for a coffee pot.
5,great coffee pot,i got this for my grandmother she loves it uses it everyday and it makes a great cup of coffee!
5,LUV IT!!!!!,"Simple and ingenious! Good quality and timely delivery. Very easy to use - practically idiot-proof :) Makes a very hot, well-rounded, robust coffee with a lot of flavor and little bitterness. The quality of the coffee and the simplicity of the design will make you wonder: How the heck did we decide to abandon THIS for that miserable (and ubiquitous..) drip machine??? Highly recommend it. If it ever breaks down I'm most certainly going to replace it!"
3,"Only one thing wrong, BUT","This percolator works fine -- BUT there are no inside measurement markings as stated in product handbook and/or as one would expect. I can live with this but it falls below what I would expect from Farberware and quite frankly cannot understand why this would happen. Also, I would rather pay $2 more for a glass percolator top than have to order separately from another seller."
3,"It's OK, but",This is a nice looking coffee pot. I've used it and found it to work well. It's kinda light duty but should be good enough for occasional use.CONS:1. would be much nicer if made with a copper bottom instead of alluminum.2. should have come with a glass perk top instead of plastic. I did purchase a glass top but this added $6.00 to my total purchase price.
4,Stove top percolator coffee pot,Attractive pot but I was disappointed because it is very light weight. For the price I expected something heavier and more sturdier. Coffee comes out weak so be sure to add extra when brewing. The great thing is that the coffee comes out nice and hot so it is not necessary to heat the milk first in the microwave as I had to do with the old plastic Mr. Coffee maker. The only two negatives is that the top is plastic and should be replaced by glass. The other thing is that when you dismantle the pot to clean it watch out that you don't lose the spring because it easily falls out!!
1,poor quality....,"I liked the design and size.But, when I boiled water, I found some metal pieces in the water. Of course, I washed with hot water before using it.I spent about an hour to clean it, especially, the spout part was very difficult to clean. But metal pieces are still being taken off."
4,Farberware Classic Yosemite,"Great little coffee pot !!...All stainless steel so no after taste from plastic parts ...There are a couple of drawbacks ...Coffee grinds when you are done making coffee that lay at the bottom ...Pour slowly and you don't get them in your coffee ... The metal top expands , and the see thru top loosens up ...They need to figure out a solution for that as the top can come off while pouring coffee ... It's great to go back to that full bodied taste of rich coffee again ...Using this pot does not dilute the coffee, and seems to smooth out the taste of the coffee .. Any brand I put into it tastes better than it does from a typical plastic drip machine ...I need a larger coffee pot now !!...I enjoy the coffee more , and want more of it !!...Great for home or camp !!....Jim"
5,Perk is the best!,"I always wondered why certain restaurants served coffee that was better than what I brewed at home. I spent lots of time trying different coffees, a Chemex coffee maker and a top of the line 14 cup Cuisinart coffee maker. Who would have thought the solution would be the lowly perk pot?Granted, the restaurants use big coffee urns, but the results can be duplicated with this little pot, so if you've been to a restaurant that somehow makes the most delicious coffee, soon you will be doing so at home :)Resign yourself to buying a glass top at the time of purchase. Just immediately throw away the plastic one... you're still saving money over a drip coffee maker. Also, wait till the pot cools down before you wash it, otherwise the glass top will break. Additional replacements can be found at your local Kohl's, and they're inexpensive."
4,Great Little Percolator,"I have had this percolator for a few years now, and it's still going strong! I highly prefer percolated coffee, and everyone who has tried mine has said it is great. Everything about this percolator (except for the sub-par plastic cap and metal fitting) seems high quality.The only problem I have had is that the plastic top that came with the percolator long since deteriorated. It was yellow and cracked, and had apparently shrunk, as it no longer fit the lid at all and just lifted/fell out. I was about ready to toss the percolator due to this, until I found the Fitz-All Replacement Percolator Top. It is an attractive glass top (with metal ring), that fits my percolator like it was made for it. It has been used about once or twice a week for almost 6 months now, and is still in like-new condition. Why doesn't the percolator come standard with this top? It has greatly extended the life of my percolator.Fitz-All Replacement Percolator Top, Small"
4,Works Well,"Perks a steaming hot cup of joe for sure. Yes, it comes with a plastic top so it loses one star. I ordered theClear glass percolator top, fits Farberware, etc.(Model #135) at the same time and they arrived together."
4,Easy to Use and Makes Good Coffee,"We searched through a lot of coffee percolators until we settled on this one. It worked great on the gas stove in our camper, and makes more than enough coffee for 4 people. Good quality, and I like that the inside is finished making it easier to clean than some other models. My one complaint is that there is quite a bit of guesswork involved in deciding when the coffee is ready - the instructions give a range of minutes when it could be done. We basically waited until the liquid bubbling in the clear bulb on top is coffee colored, and then gave it a few more minutes to make a strong brew. It would be nicer if there was diagram for how long to leave however many cups and on what heat level. However, we are generally happy with it, and of the choices available, I would say this is the best."
5,coffee pot,"This pot is easy to use, easy to clean and makes good coffee, I use it for making tea as well. Or just to heat milk for hot cocoa. I would recomend this for anyone."
4,Good enough,"Got this to take while staying with friends that don't drink coffee. Little difficult to see fill line on the inside, and if you like strong coffee don't fill up the water reservoir, but was good enough for what we got it for."
5,Stainless Steel Percolator,"I love this Percolator, because of the strong construction. If my electric goes off I can still have my coffee, on my natural gas stove. The weather patterns are unpredictable. Who go without their joy of coffee. I been drinking it since 2 years old. thanks for a great product. It does not pick up the metal taste! Martha"
4,Great for emergency,We bought this to arrive a day before superstore Sandy. Good thing we did as we lost power for five days but still had coffee ever morning on our gas stove top with this percolator and a match. Performed well and the coffee taste was excellent.
5,excellent product,"Initially I was looking for a not too pricey percolator, yet good enough. Well, this percolator has exceed my expectations. I have used it constantly and have not given me any problem."
2,Safety hazard,"I purchased this coffee pot a few months ago and have used it less than 50 times. I really liked the coffee. However, today when I was washing it, the handle came loose from the body of the pot. Fortunately, it held only warm water and was in the sink. If it had been straight off the stove with a hot pot of brewed coffee in it, it could have caused a very bad scald when it fell. The handle is only spotwelded and the screw in the handle does not go into the pot. Beware!"
2,High maintenance!,"Purchased this instead of a big coffee contraption. It is terrible. Or maybe it just requires more time and patience than I have, prior to my first cup of coffee. I couldn't really tell when the coffee was done. The directions say to remove the grinds before pouring... huh??? The pot is very hot and impossible to remove the grinds. I ended up with a bitter cup of coffee. I definitely don't have the patience for this thing - although I'm sure I could figure it out through trial and error eventually. I'm going to get a French coffee press instead."
5,Best of the stove-top percolators,"I love stove-top perked coffee and my coffee has caused many in my family to make the switch. I've tried the Copco and the Rapid Brew and they fell short of being a sturdy, long-term percolator for those who use it daily. I recommend this one as the best so far. I am ordering the glass dome, plastic will stain after a while and isn't a good match for a percolator. The Paula Deen without a dome is just playing a guessing game as to the strength of brew."
3,am I using it incorrectly?,I have been using one of those small Primula Aluminum Stovetop Coffee Makers because I love the coffee but needed something bigger so I went with this percolator. I have tried it 4 times now and the first two tasted awful and the second two were so so. Because everyone gave it such high reviews I am going to try a few more times.... it seems pretty dummy proof... but I am thinking about returning it.
2,knob broke in 2 weeks,"renders itself useless. nowhere to find the replacement, warranty requires to ship the item back with a $10 check, ~wow, what's the heck? Why not just get a new one or keep away from this product and/or this manufacture forever..."
5,the best coffee I ever made,I have 2 of these coffee pots and a 12 cup stove top percolator. This is the only coffee pot I will ever use. I use to use an electric one by Farberware but threw it out. I get more compliments on my coffee.
5,Best Camping Coffee Maker,I bought this coffee maker for a camping trip. There were alot of coffee drinkers that came up. Instant coffee didnt seem like a good option so I thought the old fashion coffee maker would be the best solution. Well the pot did a great job and the coffee tasted delish... Would recommend to anyone who needs an option when no electricity is a factor.
4,"Nice, sturdy percolator","I bought this to replace my Coleman red enamel percolator. I really like how sturdy this one is compared to my Coleman, which had very flimsy internal parts that quickly bent out of shape and made the pot unusable after a while. This percolator has no such problems with its parts. My only complaints are that I do detect a slight metallic taste to my coffee, and because the rim of the pot curves in, it's hard to get all the water out of the pot during washing. I do think that part of this is just me and that I need to get a better quality of coffee (I've been using Dunkin Donuts). Other than that, I am really pleased with this percolator so far and don't regret my purchase."
3,Okay pot except for unforgivable design defect,"It looks like everyone has trouble with the knobs on these, so much so that an aftermarket replacement knob is a recommended add-on. Given the long history of this type of brewer, this design defect really isn't forgivable. It's still a usable pot, but I had to de-merit it 2 stars. =( Farberware's product support isn't really helpful either."
3,"Okay product, not for me!","The product is not bad, works as advertized, but coffee is not strong enough for me. I tried with more powder, I just can't get it to brew to the strength I prefer!"
4,Awesome. Makes great coffee,"We just got a new Keureg. When I did the math per cup, I felt bad about a third cup o' joe on Saturdays. Hence, this purchase. It makes my kitchen smell great on a weekend and brews up to eight yummy cups.Clean-up is kinda messy, I can never completely empty the pot."
2,8 cup perculator - by Faberware,"Didn't realize that it made so much coffee, but it works like it is supposed to. takes a while to get the water boiling. Problem I had with this Perc was the flimsy construction of the handle. The one I got broke off after about three or four uses, and once it breaks off it can't be attached back on. Can't believe others haven't had this same problem. I wouldn't recommend this model to anyone, although it makes good coffee."
5,Makes Great Coffee,"Purchased this product to take on camping trips and it holds up well, is rugged and makes a great pot of coffee. Completely satisfied with this product. Five Stars to the seller and the manufacturer."
3,Coffee Hog,"This percolator calls for twice as much coffee per cup as our Cuisinart drip and produces coffee that is weak at best. My memory of perked coffee was ""strong and very hot"". This coffee is weak and very hot. Not really what I was looking for."
2,"It needs a mesh filter.,., Duh!","So this is a great percolator, made well and all, however, it still gets grains of coffee on the bottom. I have read all the directions and I am aware of the grind type of coffee I am to use, and still...My grandmother has an electric GE percolator from the 50's and even that one has a stainless steel mesh filter.. (and it works great after all these years).My point... if you chose to buy this, use a fine stainless steel mesh hand held filter when you pour the coffee.And...I bought this ""Clear glass percolator top, fits Farberware, etc."" and it didn't fit as well as it should have, it's okay but there are not enough threads to secure it on as good as it should be."
5,Great perculator,"We use this when we camp with our travel trailer and don't have access to electricty. This is a great stovetop perculator, and it makes great coffee."
5,"Slow down there, bud...percolators take a while","we love ours. Set it to high heat until it you hear in boiling and just starting to ""perk,"" then turn it way down and let the physics do the work. If you're pressed for time, this is NOT the pot for you. If you take time with your morning brew and like fresh perked awesome tasting coffee from ANY brand, this is your pot. The longer it perks, the more intense the flavor.Expect about 25-30 minutes from start to finish. Enjoy."
4,Definitely Classic!,"I've enjoyed using Farberware pots and pans for many years and have been using one set for better than 30 years. This coffee pot won't be any different. It's solid and hefty, even though it does have that plastic knob on the lid. Although I bought a glass one to replace the plastic, I haven't bothered to change them out yet. Besides, the plastic IS cool to the touch. Making percolated coffee just reminds me of my Dad Z'L who enjoyed and appreciated a well-brewed cup of coffee. Now I have to remember not to the grind the coffee as finely as I've been used to doing!"
3,"Fabulous coffee, BUT...........","We all agree this neat pot makes a grand cup of coffee, however the plastic insert on the lid soon loses its thread rendering the pot useless. Originally the review of parts mentioned a glass insert but I see that has been removed and not even mentioned.I was able to order a glass insert on line. let's hope it fits. $6.98 and no shipping charge. I'm giving it three stars for the inconvenience and expense of having to replace the plastic insert. My plastic insert lasted three months."
3,Lip Service,The coffee pot works fine with one fault. There is a curved lip facing inward all the way around the top restricting the flow of coffee grounds that have fallen to the bottom of the pot from being poured out. Very annoying when cleaning otherwise works as advertised.
2,Too much work!,"There was the occasional pot of very good, very hot coffee. That kept me trying for a long time. But there were more bad pots than good. I really tried to time it carefully and follow the directions exactly and frankly was baffled that the outcomes were not consistent. Eventually I decided it was too iffy and too much work, particularly when caffeine-deprived at the crack of dawn. Back to my aero-press."
5,COFFEE POT,MAKES REAL OLD FASHIONED COFFEE PERKS AND KEEPS HOT ! I HAVE GIVEN UP ON ELECTRIC POTS. WILL REPLACE THIS WHEN NEED BE.
2,Dont get it.,It makes great coffee but the screw that holds the handle in had only the smallest piece of metal to screw into. It would not hold the handle on the pot. I secured the handle/screw to the pot with head gasket sealer. Now it works fine.
4,great coffee,makes a great cup of coffee the good old fashion way in 20 minutes. I just wish that the perking knob was glass not plastic
5,"Finally, HOT COFFEE !","I bought this stovetop percolator to use on my propane barbeque grill just incase the power goes off for another 14 days (Hurricane Sandy, Long Island) and I just tried it on my stove to make sure I knew how to use it.The coffee is so much better than my drip coffee-maker! I intend to use this new percolator on a daily basis! I made the coffee, then put my electric stove burner on low (2 setting) and even after an hour, the coffee was still hot and not too strong!I highly recommend this pot, especially if you have Amazon Prime, because I paid only $20.00 for it.I cannot say how thrilled I am ! I used the round filters, and bought the glass top."
1,It should be taken off the market.,"It makes decent coffee, but the functionality of this paticular perc. is dangerous. You are supposed to remove the lid and take out the grounds basket prior to pour. It would be a little easier if the top from which you grab onto wasnt stripped from its steel lid. So you have to hold it a certain way and apply pressure at a certain angle so what little of the threads you have left can grab onto something to take the lid off. Then..... grab onto the grounds basket, with a pot holder mind you, we're dealing with hot steamy coffee here, lift and let drain a little and set into sink. I have had burns and hot grounds spills and frustrations just cleaning this thing. While looking for a different perc, I ran into a picture of this thing and had to right a review, my first, to warn people. I have had great experience with the 4 cup screw base perc. Im going to check out the 9 cup size and its reviews. Good luck."
1,Cheap Design Cheap Material,"No problems with the plastic cap like some people seem to have a problem with, but it's very poorly designed. Normal pot of water takes 4 or 5 minutes to boil, but with this water takes 25 minutes on an open flame to get hot enough to perk. Also, instead of putting a ridge to hold the filter at the proper level they decided to use a cheaply made loose spring (which got lost easily) which rests on, guess what, a ridge on the stem that couldn't have served the same damn purpose to just hold the filter level if they had bothered to put it high enough. I won't ever buy anything from this company again (I've had a ton of coffee makers including high-end). Farberware is a bad company that uses the cheapest materials they can possibly get away with. What a rip-off."
2,Not crazy about it,"I bought this percolator because the reviews were excellent, but I was unhappy with the unattractive/bulky look and the several parts that I had to take apart to wash every time I used it. Needless to say, I'm getting rid of it and getting myself a french presser instead."
1,Disappointed in this coffee pot,"I got this coffee pot as a Christmas present for my mother-in-law. She loved it at first. But when she used it for the first time after washing it she realized the bottom of the pot was made from aluminum. Because when she dried it with a white towel, black tarnish came off onto the towel.She asked me why I would give her a aluminum pot that would cause her to get Alzheimer's disease. Ugh! How was I to know a stainless steel pot would have an aluminum bottom? Boy, it was an embarassing moment to say in the least.I must say the basic construction and look of the pot is great. But if you don't like to use aluminum pots, then I guess you won't like this coffee pot. It's a shame because I really did like it. I will be returning it."
3,"Good Percolator, But Cheap Lousy Plastic Cap","As the title of my review suggests, the Farberware Classic Yosemite percolator is a good coffee maker. Unfortunately, the ""bean counters"" at Farberware insist on using a lousy plastic percolator cap on an otherwise excellent percolator.When I received my unit, the cap was already loose. I tried tightening it by screwing it into the lid, but that was a no-go. The plastic threads are apparently so darned flimsy that they wear against the sharp sheet metal of the lid opening. I suspect that somebody within Farberware got a nice raise or bonus for switching from glass to plastic on this part. Otherwise, I'd have rated it 5 stars.I went ahead & bought a Fitz-All glass cap from my local hardware store, which fits snugly and does the job that the original Farberware cap SHOULD have done."
2,Brewed Coffee is tasteful but lid is impossible,I purchased this percolator less than 2 months ago. I am not a heavy coffee drinker so I do not make coffee everyday. It does make very tasteful coffee but the so called glass top is not glass but rather plastic. Now the stupid thing has melted on one side and you cannot lift the top without the dome lifting out and it is very easy to get burned on the hot liquid if it splashes on you. I think if they would have made it glass there would not be a problem like this. Now I don't know what to do with it because of this. Really is not worth the money
3,farberware percolator,"some design flaws include small 1/2"" opening at spout, turned rim that prevents complete draining of pot,barely visible water guide lines."
3,Good coffee,"I have had this for over a year and it still works fantastic. There is no buildup and the coffee taste fresh every time. The clear thing in the top can be tricky to put back on- it is removable. And I always have to have 2 potholders to pour it because the handle gets extremely hot. Also, the handle can melt and stink of burnt plastic if placed on the bigger burner because it reaches pretty low."
1,Poorly made.,"I bought this based on the reviews on Amazon. Looked like a nice percolator. We took it camping. I noticed the first time we used it that the plastic handle was loose. I bought a camp screwdriver to tighten it. Unfortunately, the handle came completely off the second time we used it. It looked like it was glued on. Don't think that glueing a plastic handle to metal constitutes durable construction. I don't recommend this product, or any with a plastic handle. Returned this and am looking for a better made metal handled percolator to replace this joke of a coffee pot with. Totally lame to lose the handle on our trip. Don't buy this cheaply made product."
1,Farberware 50124 Classic Yosemite Stainless Steel Percolator,"I didn't have it long and the clear bubble top broke when washing. Really disappointing. I love Faberware products, but never get the Stove Top Model or a Clear Bubble Top no matter how cute it looks to see the coffee perking ;-) Not worth it if it goes quick like mine did. Get the 12 Cup Faberware Electic Perculator, it is more expensive, but totally worth every penny. Had mine over 20 years and have usable parts still to exchange when the other is dirty, Worth every penny. Thanks for allowing me to share my experience with you."
1,Thin gauge stainless,"As with many coffee drinkers who are rediscovering the percolator, my interest in this unit was tweaked by the demise of my electric coffee maker, and what I thought was the loss of my old GSI percolator in a move. I received this, and was quite surprised at the thinness of the metal. I scoured the boxes, and did indeed find the GSI unit. It was of a much thicker gauge and better built. The handle is also only attached at one point, and I doubt it will last. I sent mine back."
1,Percolator kit?,"I rarely review products, but I felt compelled to make an exception with this percolator, The reviews of this product that I read seemed to be good and reasonable over all except for the plastic, (easily replaceable with glass), top. I ordered it. I didn't realize I was getting a coffee pot kit. When it arrived the handle wasn't attached. There weren't even any holes drilled for the screw. This could have worked out OK If I wanted to be different and, say... mount the handle on the side. Then I put the lid on the pot and couldn't get it back off with any amount of force. I stopped short of snapping the plastic top off. I had to pry it off with a screwdriver. Needless to say I'm sending it back for a refund. P. S. I found a great percolator at ACE hardwear, IN THE STORE. It's a Fitz All rapid brew with a glass top. Good quality. Works great. Look around on AMAZON. It's here too, but why bother?"
3,Alternate purchase,I was not able to use this item as I purchased an alternative electric percolator from Amazon. I have returned this item for credit/refund.
1,Not your mother's stove top percolator!,"Garbage. And when I contacted the manufacturer, I found out that all Farberware cookware is now MADE IN CHINA. I couldn't believe it. I bought this percolator because it was Farberware, assuming it was the good stuff my mother had all my life. Farberware used to be made of top quality steel: you bought it or got it as a wedding present, and it lasted a lifetime. Not now. THIN metal, cheaply made, and all the pieces that used to be glass or heat resistant, are now some type of plastic. I am so disappointed in this product. :o("
4,Beware - The Top Knob is Not Glass!,"Ha ha -Amazon isn't firing on all cylinders with this one. I ordered this percolator because it was supposed to have a glass top. When I got it, the top was plastic. I sent an email saying ""Where is the glass top you advertised"" and got an email back saying ""You must have received a defective or outdated item we have shipped you a new item"". By the time I got the email the item was already shipped. Of course when it arrived it also has a plastic top. Why don't they just change their description? Who knows. The percolator works great, looks great, but if you are trying to get rid of plastic in the kitchen be forewarned - the knob on top is plastic, not glass. On the upside, I was able to get a glass knob at my local mom and pop hardware store for 2.00. A much better deal than ordering it from an independent seller on Amazon and paying through the nose for shipping. The small glass top from Fitz-all fits the pot perfectly."
4,Fantastic coffee!!,"Can't believe how much better the coffee is from this maker than from a drip maker. It would be a perfect product if not for the plastic percolator top, which I replaced with glass. That's the only reason for the 4 star rating rather than 5. Takes a little longer but coffee can be reheated and it's definitely more smooth and you get some of the essential oils that you wouldn't get with a filter."
1,Unusable out of the box,"For some reason, the handle was wrapped separately from the pot. There's a screw in the handle, but no hole in the pot for a screw so I can actually attach it. Am I supposed to drill a hole and hope the screw is long enough? Don't think so -- this item will be returned tomorrow."
1,Disappointing,Reviewer Fred Brack obviously didn't examine this coffee pot before reviewing it. The knob is PLASTIC not glass! It was fine until the plastic knob became discolored and no longer stays screwed in the pot. The stainless steel pot will last forever and become a permanent part of the environment while the knob only lasted a few months. What ever happened to the great corningware (I had a great one in New York but I accidentally forgot it when I moved to California) and pyrex percolators? I guess there's no such thing as a quality stovetop percolator.
4,Very Useful,"This percolator can brew 8 cups of coffee very quickly. While it may not brew coffee as fast as a Keurig, it brews a much more robust cup of coffee and can be used in the kitchen or outdoors while camping or tailgating. The only downsides that I have encountered is that the container itself must be hand washed although the basket can be washed in a dish washer and the measuring marks are on the interior of the container next to the handle which makes it a bit awkward to read when filling up with water. Other than those two little issues this percolator rocks and fills the house with an amazing aroma of fresh brewed coffee."
3,2 design flaws,"On the plus side, it looks better than the picture. It's beautiful! The problem is the inside of the top is curled in, forming a lip that not al the water can get out of, so when you try to dump it, there's always a little water left inside. The pour spout is small and does not have a natural drain construction, so the water cannot all get out that way either. Bottom line is you have to leave it out and disassembled for it to eventually dry. If you have room for that, you're gonna love it."
5,Great coffee maker!,"This is a beautiful and well made percolator. I decided to purchase a stove top maker after Hurricane Sandy knocked out my power for 10 days. Wish I had it then!I am convinced that perc is the best way to make coffee, if you have the time."
5,"I love perked coffee. and this is pot is easy to use. Goes right on the burner, easy access, not much in way of grounds in wate","This is pot is easy to use. Goes right on the burner. Grounds don't get all over the place or in the coffee. It is big enough to make enough coffee for two people and small enough to take with camping, etc. I would recommend."
5,YAY!!!,"ok, so I was one of the victims without power for several days from Superstorm Hurricane Sandy. I bought this right after I could access my wifi-lol! GOing without coffee was not a happy thing and I'm sure this will help!"
5,Great Percolator,I was very please with the pot it was everything I expected. I would recommend this to anyone good buy.
2,Percolator Problem,"I purchased this percolator several months ago and have had a problem with the boiling coffee belching out of the spout. I fill it to the 6 cup line. I sometimes place a drip type paper filter in the basket. The water starts to boil and the coffee begins to perc. Then it seems to build up pressure and explodes out of the spout all over the stove. I try to keep the flame low, but this happens whether its high or low. I may have to go back to my old beat up percolator."
4,"great percolator, minus plastic cap","this percolator is great - very little coffee sneaks through the filter, the coffee doesn't have the enamelware taste, and the see through cap makes it easy to tell when the coffee is done. however - the cap, contrary to the amazon.com review, is not glass - it is plastic. so for those who are health conscious when it comes to boiling water and plastic, go ahead and order the glass replacement cap on the page."
4,Great coffee pot!,Makes great coffee - much better than drip. One thing - a little hard to clean the pot - deep creases in bottom tends to escape the brush!
3,Only so-so,"The glass (plastic?) percolator top is already so loose that we cannot open the pot by gripping it but must pry off the top by the edge when completely cooled. It does still work fine (so far) and has not ""blown off"" the top when perking but I don't know how long that will last with the top being so loose now. It does perk a fine cup of coffee which is the most important part anyway and the only reason I still gave it three stars when I might have gone lower because of the loose top. We also purchased it because of wanting to be able to have coffee when the power is out when the electric drip therefore won't work (it seems to happen fairly frequently in our part of the country.) Can't give a very strong recommendation with the problems stated but did give three stars because of the good coffee we can still get out of it up to this time. Hope everyone else's has a better top because then a five star rating would be merited."
5,Excellent product,"The percolator brews an excellent cup of coffee. The only thing about it that I would like changed is the plastic top. However, you can order them online for about 3 dollars. Overall I rate this an awesome item. I will not switch back to drip brews."
2,"""ALMOST""","THE BODY, THE ACTUAL POT IS FINE ""BUT"" THE PLASTIC PERCOLATER TOP DOES NOT DO ITS JOB. AFTER A FEW SCREW ONS & OFFS IT NO LONGER FITS. I'VE BOUGHT BOTH THE PLASTIC & THE GLASS AND NEITHER FITS FOR VERY LONG. BUT NEVER SAY DIE, MAYBE IF I MAKE MY OWN TOP I'LL BE A HAPY CAMPER. UNTIL THEN I KNOW I'VE BEEN HAD. DOES ANYBODY EVER TEST ANYTHING ANYMORE.{R.T.W.}"
1,CHEAP<CHEAP CHEAP,"Dont waste your money. This is so flimsy and dangerous. The under lip of pot is sharp and if you are not careful, you will cut yourself when washing. The usual flimsy handle problem encountered with Farberware persists. Why they put a spring on the stem where the basket goes is beyond me.I bought this to replace my elderly moms older Farberware coffee pot, what a huge mistake. I am now going to buy her a Mr Coffee so i dont have to worry about an injury. This is definitely not the quality Farberware I grew up with. I have already given up on their cookware. Farberware I dont know how you're still in business!"
1,Warning: Has plastic top,I bought this to reduce the BPA in my life and was disappointed to find a plastic top that will be perced into your coffee.Amazon.com review only reference to the top in products description and said glass top. Poor job. Will return.
2,"The Classic Yosemite Look Is Appealing, But the Platic Top Is Crap!","Pros:* Simple classic look* Stainless steelCons:* The plastic top melts* The plastic percolator top ... whoever, the idiot, from the Farberware product development thought of using a plastic top on this boiling hot coffee pot should be whacked across the head ... what an idiot!"
5,Emergency kit,"A stove top coffee pot is MUST for every emergency kit. When my power goes out, even with a generator, my drip coffee maker draws so much power that I'd need to turn everything else off. This Farberware pot works great and looks beautiful too. It's definitely slower than an electric coffee maker and the coffee is piping hot! Great for camping too."
1,Still Searching For the Perfect Brew,"Like many other reviewers, I'm highly disappointed in this product. The measure marks are engraved on the ""outside"" of the pot, resulting in a poorly visible and reversed mark on the inside of the pot. I could understand engraving on the outside IF there was a clear window to see water level, but this is not the case. I'm also not satisfied with the fact that the clear knob for the lid is plastic. My main reason for buying this product was to get away from plastic and the uncertainty of BPA. Next, the construction is awful. There's a recession in the interior bottom as well as a lip on the interior top. Both make it very difficult to clean oil residues completely or to rinse and drain completely. Last, (I'm not sure where this is coming from) I notice a bit of a metallic taste in the brew.I may have to find a larger French Press to accompany the one we currently have when I need greater quantities of coffee to serve."
5,GOOD POT AT A GOOD PRICE,I ALWAYS LIKE A PERK CUP OF COFFEE.FOUND THIS ONE TO BE JUST RIGHT. IT CAN MAKE JUST 3 TO 4 CUPS OF COFFEE OR 8 CUPS OF COFFEE. ALWAYS RELIED ON FARBERWARE IN THE PAST AND IT STILL HAS A GOOD REPUTATION. CLEANS WELL AND SHINES ON TOP OF MY STOVE. EXCELLENT POT FOR AN EXCELLENT PRICE
4,Good Coffee Pot,"I bought this to use on the stove top of a travel trailer. This is much better than the aluminum camp mess kit pots I have also used. The stainless steel is sturdier and more attractive. There is a spring on the pump that pushes the basket tight to the lid, virtually eliminating the spill over of grounds you get with the simpler, mess kit percolators. And the plastic handle means you don't need a potholder or towel or sweater hem to safety pour from the pot. Since reading the other reviews about the plastic lid top breaking, I have been using my fingernails to help lift the lid from the rim. This is a good coffee pot, and the price is right."
4,Wash really well before use.,"I bought this percolator because my mom was always telling me how much better the coffee from a percolator tastes versus a drip coffee maker. It works really well. BUT when I got the percolator, I washed it just like the direction states. I boiled water with the filter and all, just before the inital use. Well afterwards, I looked inside and there was this black blob in the edge of the percolator. I assumed that it's from when the metal was cut and fabricated. Just becareful before use. Make sure to wash it really well, I ended up using a q-tip to clean in the botttom and top edges to get all the black stuff out. It did finally come out, which makes me wonder, if I didn't look inside. Wouldn't it effect the taste of the coffee? I'd be drinking black junk along with my coffee. I just think that the manufactor should have some warning that states it'd possible have some residue from the manufactoring of this product."
3,It's ok...,"I enjoy making coffee every morning in this percolator. It brews up a nice bold cup. My only negative remark is the plastic top is cheap and flimsy. I'm afraid it will break everytime I go to pull the top off. Other than that, it was a fair price. I guess you get what you pay for."
4,nice looking perc,"this form has great heat retention and distribution as it hit boil faster then my old pot did. the inserts seem a bit narrow for this pot, so care is needed to line up the vertical hot water lift tube with the inside lip of the top dome. This is basically a very pretty 3-star quality product, that I gave a bonus star for being cheap enough that I could afford to buy the separate glass knob to crown this properly."
4,Great percolator!,"I've had this percolator for almost 3 months now, and I use it almost daily. I have had no issues with the handle or the plastic piece at the top.The percolator has 3 (hard to see lines) in it for making 4,6, or 8 cups of coffee. I generally use the 4 cup - just enough coffee to start my morning! Getting the amount of coffee correct has been a bit of an experiment, but I think I have it now. Make sure you use course ground coffee."
5,Beautiful performance,"I'm listening to this right now - found it on the shelf and didn't even know we had it. It's just beautiful! The orchestra, the voices, the soloists - everything. I'm not a music expert; I will simply say that from my pov, it's a great album."
3,Karate For Kids I,"The camera focuses from the waist up, some of the time, so you can not see stances or whole body movements during some basic punch and block techniques. My 8 year old liked the music, instructor and the kids his age. He uses the streching exercises he learned from the tape. A good way to get a youngster motivated but not too good for learning techniques."
2,Nothing new,"I didn't get much of value from this book, nor did I get any new ideas about professional decorating. I think it would only appeal to a very upscale market."
2,Nina Campbell's Decorating Secrets,"Only buy this book if you like old fashioned English style of decorating. This book gave me alergies. Too much of everything. Except ""secrets"". . . There wern't any. Who lives like this and why."
1,"If you're over the top, you might like it!","I think if your decorating style is very ""over the top"" Brittish Proper, you may like this book. While I liked looking through this book one or two times, it is not one that I take off the shelf for inspiration very often. I didn't find any ""secrets"" on decorating in this book - except for putting fringe and tassles along the ceilings and in corners - YUCK! It is a book with pictures and tips you would expect to find in a five dollar magazine."
2,no ordinary man,Never read this author before. From the back of the cover it looked like a good mystery. When I began reading it I realized that it was a mystery but it was also a romance book and I do not like these. The writing was not great and it could not hold my interest. I never finished it.
1,Peachtree Pro hard to install - not for me!,"I purchased Peachtree Pro to use in my small business. Right out of the box, I am having problems installing the software. After three attempts to load it, I finally called Peachtree Customer Service and am in no better shape than I was before I called. After waiting on hold for greater than 30 minutes, I worked with a tech specialist for over an hour, but no resolution to the problem could be found. The main issue is ""conflicts with firewalls."" Even with firewalls disabled, the program would not load. I have now wasted more than 6 hours and still do not have a reliable accounting program."
3,Difficult for a novice,I have found this accounting software to be very inflexible and unforgiving when it comes to mistakes. Although my CPA likes it I would have been better off with Quick Books....
4,Runs awesome under VISTA with Virtual PC!,"We are actually running Peachtree Permium Accounting 2006 for Manufacturing, but I assume the same applies. Sage indicates that 2006 is not supported for VISTA and that 2007 may be...problem solved: Microsoft Virtual PC.[...]Peachtree runs better on the new hardware/software config than it did on our previous machine with just XP Pro.[...]"
4,I learned it in a weekend,"Had to learn this program in a weekend. Then, clean up the books by Monday. I did it without much sleep.Once you learn it's style of entry, its fast. I spend no more than an hour a day on the Peach now with no book keeper.I bought the support contract and have only used it once in six months. The guy helped me modify what printed on the payroll and a/p checks. I have since modified my financial statements on my own.Maybe my success was 'cuz I know accounting. All this bitchin about PeachTree seems weird??!! I guess you love it or hate it."
2,See the show live and skip the movie,"This show is much funnier on stage. It's supposed to be a spoof of Plautine comedy, and the physical humor is more effective on a smaller, more intimate scale than in this lavish production. The unchanging stage setting of the three house entrances (of Lycus, Senex, Erroneus) is essential for a lot of the humorous chase- and-hiding scenes, and the film ruins that aspect by taking us inside the houses and around the city. The soundtrack is fine with the big numbers (""Comedy Tonight,"" ""Everybody Ought to Have a Maid,"" ""Lovely""), but the filler music is dull. Of course, on the stage you don't need filler music."
1,Region two can not be played on US DVD players,It should be made clear that this product can not be used in the United States. Apparently Region two is Europe and Japan only.
2,Not So Funny Anymore,"I was prepared to really like this movie. I love Zero Mostel, Buster Keaton, and Jack Gilford. However, mostly it was a disappointment. The script was uneven, and much of the humor was either sexist or a bit raunchy in nature, which may be somewhat true to the Roman view of women, but it became tiresome after a while. My husband and son found it overdone, as well.That said, there were some really funny bits in it and many of the actors did a wonderful job. Buster Keaton was brilliant, as usual. Even in his older years and with a lesser role, he managed to milk the most from it. Zero Mostel was good, but I did like him better in The Producers.I think I was hoping for brilliant, which most of those involved in this movie are certainly capable of, but instead got uneven and definitely not something worth watching a second time."
2,Horribly Dated,"With apparently no faith in the pretty strong material, the filmmakers decided to do away with most of the aspects that made the musical charming in the first place (like, oh, most of the music!) and replace it with groovy 60's trickery that looks like something right out of Benny Hill (look, the action is sped up to make everyone look like they're running really, really fast...isn't that funny?)Zero Mostel does what he can, but he can't salvage this. No one else even registers.I saw this on stage, and that version blows the film version out of the water.Grade: D"
5,Perfect if you want a comedy tonight!,"Okay, I admit it, I'm biased. I love Sondheim, I love Roman / Greek plays, I think Zero Mostel is one of the finest comedy actors / Broadway performers the world has ever seen. But even if you set aside the brilliant score (all the best songs are kept from the stage version, and for those of you who think Sondheim is unhummable high-brow stuff, I have two words for you - 'Comedy Tonight'), the spot-on delivery of Zero, Michael Crawford, Jack Gilford and all the others beside, then buy it because the script by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart is an absolute gem. If you want farcical, hysterical, light and frothy comedy, you'll find little better than this."
5,Something Amusing,"I have seen this movie many times, and it never grows old. If you're looking for deep meanings, forget it. As the title song says, ""Weighty affairs will just have to wait"". Pseudulus (Zero Mostel) is a Roman slave who seizes upon an opportunity to win his freedom, when his somewhat dim-witted master develops a crush on the girl next door. Unfortunately, she is a concubine who has been promised to a Roman general. The movie is a carnival of sight gags, running jokes, and great one-liners. Sure, it gets pretty silly at times, but thats part of the fun. If you like the ""Monty Python"" type of humor, you will probably like this."
2,Cornball alacarte,"Fair to good comedy, but a long way from great comedy. Is it worth the buy ? maybe if your ready for some tall CORN, but definitely not a collectors edition. Buy it once, view it once but it will probably b a longtime before you would view it again, if ever ?"
1,Review for Movie Mars,"If I could give this company 0 stars for customer dissatisfaction, I would. I do not recommend purchasing anything from this company."
3,Miss the Sondheim score; Hate the slapstick,"Richard Lester, who was popular at the time for his Beatles film ""Hard Days Night,"" obviously had no affection for the musical theater. The score, which is one of Sondheim's funniest, is eviscerated. Only a few tunes remain, and those sound overproduced and canned.The rapid edits, the overblown mugging and physical slapstick were trendy at the time but are now tedious and stale, abandoned by even MTV, where early videos often mimicked the ""Hard Day's Night"" style.The comedians do their best to survive the bad directing choices. But the movie, for all its frantic ""Mad Mad World"" pace, drags and sags."
2,Not too many things funny happen . . at all,"I must say, I've seen this story played out in the theater twice in my lifetime, thus far. And in both occassions, I loved it! The theater productions offered more in the way of humor, satire and coordinated slap-stick. So it was with some disappointment that I wrote this critique. Where as I knew many of the actors in the movie and have come to enjoy many of there other work, this movie lacked the timing needed to make it work. I'm not sure exactly . . . but it seem watered down. See this in a play/theater form and I'm certain you'll appreciate the story much better. And yet, I'm glad I have this on DVD . . . a collectors gem.Q!"
2,DVD,"The movie itself is great, however the company sent me a European DVD that can only be played in a European DVD player. The company is in the USA and it was sent to me in NJ, USA so why send a European DVD? There was too much paperwork to return so I just took it as a loss."
4,Forget the critics and have a laugh!,"This movie is absolutely hysterical. The music is first-class and the laughs keep coming at every turn.This was a film that was done so the stars could have some fun and the audience would have some fun along with them. Zero Mostel is a riot in this movie and keeps you longing for more all the way to the end.Watch this one ""just for the fun of it!"""
1,FORUM FILM DVD,"wrong region. excellent service ultimate stage video , wish it was of whoopie goldberg production. right region came in time"
1,Not an American movie,"This movie was a EU movie and was not to be sold out of their country..not to be exported, and it will only let you watch it three times before you can't see it anymore."
1,wrong format,I only have one comment to make about this product. I amsure the dvd is wonderful as was the stage play. The only problem is I was sent the european version od the dvd which can not be played on american players. Ehen I called to return it for the right format I was told I could only get a refund and it did not coe from amazon. I do not want to have it appen again. The return process is great.
1,Defective Merchandise,"The DVD could not be played in my player. An error message stated this DVD cannot be played ""in this region.""The merchandise is defective.Sincerely,P Botos"
4,The Last Film Apperance Of The Great Buster Keaton,"I had a Buster Keaton marathon on TCM, and I taped four of his movies and a documentary. When I finished watching Buster's film SteamBoat Bill J.R, there was another film of his, what a treat to see Buster Keaton, who Played Errous(thats probley spelled wrong) the old man who was looking for his lost children. The film it self was pretty good. It had great music and a fantastic performance by Zero Mostel, Phil Silvers and Micheal Crawford. If your a Buster Keaton Fan, see this movie."
4,Good movie,I was not fond of the beginning of the movie but as the movie progressed it got better and better
2,This is not the musical that Stephen Sondheim wrote,"Regardless of how much one might like this movie, it is not the musical that Stephen Sondheim wrote or even an approximation of what was performed on Broadway under the direction of Harold Prince. This movie might have some of the same stars and the same title as the Broadway show, but like so many Hollywood adaptions, the heart was cut out. In this case most of the songs were cut, subplots added and the focus misdirected. Buster Keaton's role, for example, was trivialized compared to the stage play. You might enjoy the movie but do not think that you are watching what was shown on Broadway. With respect to the technical qualities of the DVD -- the sound is fine, the images clear, the color is good. There are no extras"
5,brilliant,"This is my all-time favorite film. It's almost beyond words -- a spectacularly gifted cast, a whole slew of hummable tunes, brilliant language play at every turn (every time I see a wine list in a restaurant now I'm tempted to ask, ""Was 1 a good year?"") and a plot that's so full of twists and reversals it takes about three viewings to sort it all out. It has everything: love, lust, greed, revenge, drag, confusion, magic potions, and the best chase scene ever filmed (on chariots, of course). It's gotten funnier every time I've seen it, which is probably a dozen times now. It's a real treasure."
5,"Something for everyone, a comedy tonight !!!","If you want a VERY funny musical,then you half to own this movie,it is SO funny,and I REALLY think it's funny when Hero(michael crawford)fell off his horse,ran after the fast going carage his girlfriend was in,and then ran smack dab in to a barn,fell out of the window,slipped into hay and then he grabed on to the carage and then he kissed his girlfriend and it was a very sweet kiss.So now all I can say is(after I just gave away a hightlight part,sorry)just buy the movie.PLEASE!!!"
1,Horrible!,"This is one of the worst (perhaps the worst) musical films ever made. The songs are terrible and the attempted comedy is not funny. All that comedic talent--Mostel, Gilford, Silvers, Keaton--wasted! According to people who have seen both, the stage presentation was far better than this butchered film version. If you haven't seen it yet, you are in an advantageous position--don't waste your time or money on this bad, bad movie!"
2,Wrong zone,For the second time I have received this DVD made for zone 2. Since I have a USA address I am puzzled why this wrong zone was sent? I was so certain that I ordered the correct zone since I went thru the hassle of returning a previous zone 2 some weeks ago!
4,When in Rome...,"This is a ripper film, as funny as I remember it from decades ago. To get Zero Mostel and Phil Silvers together on the one screen is almost too much bliss for a chap to bear. I put it on the DVD player and watched it twice straight off. I suppose that the politically correct need to be warned that this is very definitely a pre-feminist film in which all the females are either sex objects or castrating monsters. And the cine-purists had better be told that it is not in the correct cinema release aspect ratio. It is an anamorphic picture that exactly fills the 16:9 television widescreen. It must have been shot at 1:2.35, so we miss a bit on the sides. Pity. But the picture quality itself is gorgeous, one of the best discs I have seen. I suppose that I have to take off half a star for the cheating on aspect ratio. Apart from that ""A Funny Thing..."" on DVD is perfection."
4,Higly entertaining,"Like some of the other reviewers, I, too saw the play first, and I laughed so hard I literally had aching ribs for days. The movie captures much of the same sense of hilarity, but somehow the frenzy that you feel seeing the play live is lost in the movie version. Aside from that, the movie is full of sight gags, running jokes, slap stick and puns that keep you laughing. The actors look as if they truly enjoyed making this movie. This is definitely a film worth watching, but if you ever have a chance to see the musical live, take it!"
4,Great Information!!!!!!!,"This book is very well written and includes design and styling tips that cannot be found today , in current styling manuals. I think this book is very resourceful and will becoma a permanent fixture in my personal library."
4,classic and fun to play with,"this is a very nice representation of a Klingon Bird of Prey... It was put together very well, and the detail of the ship is very nice. The only thing I found disappointing was the lack of the moving wings.A nice piece for the avid Star Trek collector."
4,Well written,"I found this to be a an entertaining historical novel. Characters are entertaining and believable. She takes a few liberties with history like making the Mace the major hand to hand weapon when it was the Ax, She also makes the end of the 11th dynasty take about a year from what appears to be Mentuhotep II to Amenemhet the first 12 dynasty founder. I also have never heard that Set was a major religious cult under him. Another historical change is that it was the 12 dynasty that moved the Capital to the Nome on the border between Upper and Lower Egypt while the 11th stayed in Thebes.Those quibbles aside and probably only important to a history specialist the book remains fine entertainment with believable Ancient Egypt Characters that stay in reasonable 20th century BC behavioral type.Glad I bought it"
3,My Son Really Enjoys This,"Yes, It arrived as advertised, on time, safely packaged, and I had no issues at all.I would def do business with this company again.I bought the movie for my son and he loves it. -Jim :-)"
4,Two Weeks with Touring in Wine Country Provence in my Pocket,"We used this handy guide for two weeks as we toured Provence, tasting our way through 20+ wineries from Les Baux to Cotes du Luberon. This book provided a terrific education on the wines of the area, some great restraunt tips and most importantly ...how to find the vineyards! We used the companion Touring Rhone Wine Country as well. This is a well written and visually appealing book....certainly makes you want to stop at every opportunity. We found that we agreed with the writers recommendations almost without exception. The only area of needed improvement is in the directions to the vineyards and the detail of the maps. We sometimes had difficulty finding the recommended wineries. If one speaks French, the given addresses might be enough....but for those of us who don't...more detailed directions please. Also add winery websites...they are becoming more common."
5,mi chico latino is num.1 and its deserved to be bought.,"i think that geru second single ""mi chico latino""is abeautiful and succesfull ,i like it very much. people u must buy this single. the 2 other songs which do not exist in the debut album are good as well. people u must buy it this is enjoyfull music. geri,u r doing a good job."
1,Dumb!,"In the video Geri wants to be the sexy sexy lady. But indeed she's ridiculous. Would she need to press it to be sexy so much if she was sexy and interesting by nature? Of course not, brcause she's a boring person."
1,Disappointing product,"My product arrived in a timely manner, but it does not work. I understand the risk of purchasing a used product, but I was under the impression it was reconditioned and somewhat guaranteed to work. It did not. So I basically made a donation to the company rather than a purchase. I e-mailed the seller on 3 occasions and was never given the consideration of a response. So I guess this isn't a review of the product as much as it is venting my disappointment with the seller."
3,True Crime,"Crime Casebook from the Reader's Digest is a fair collection of real crime stories. I would have preferred a better selection, but for the time it was written, it is a decent grouping."
4,changed the formula ... not as good,"I have been buying this item for 4 years and absolutely love(d) it... great scent & moisturizing while antibacterial.The last bottle I opened is much thinner, not as moisturizing, and not as soapy.I will keep using it but I am disappointed with the change."
3,Liquid Soap,Ordered because of the Soap at Carrabas. However not the same Scent. Good but not Great...
1,"SEMINAL,FOUNDATIONAL FOR OPEN THEISM MOVEMENT","If you want to discover the primary source of the aberrant movement in Evangelical Theology today called ""Open Theism""""Free-will Theism"" or ""Presentism"", this is the book to compare with what Clark Pinnock,John Sanders and Greg Boyd have written to make their 'case'.'God at Risk';'Searching for an Adequate God';'God at War';'Trinity and Process:Critical Evaluation of Hartshorne's Di-Polar Theism Toward a Trinitarian Metaphysics','God of the Possible';'Satan & Problem of Evil' for instances.Hartshorne, especially in this volume, caused these once evangelical scholars to question,challenge,then revise many of the Attributes of God Biblically explained by the Classical Theologians for millennia. Their sincerity does not lessen how sincerely wrong their Biblical understanding,exegesis,interpret-ive techniques,conclusions are. Very enlightening to see the strong connection between PROCESS and OPENNESS. Undeniable."
5,A master piece,"For anyone on the self-realization path who have gone through the training provided through the Course In Miracles. Where the Course in Miracles handled mind training, this book takes it a step further into the realm of the heart and living through that space where the mind can be guided through love instead of fear. Highly recommended."
1,The Endless Summer Wall Poster,"When received the poster was in very bad condition. It was covered in wrinkles and unsuitable for framing. I had to return, I had to pay extra postage and I just hope that it will be in better condition when received this time. I am trying an exchange 1 time....if not received in good condition this time then I will not order anything like this again from Amazon.com."
4,Upsetter vibrates on,"Well, who would have thought that Lee Perry, at 64, would return to the mixing desk and put out one of his best albums since he torched the Black Ark in '79? Here it is anyway, one echo-drenched ex-Perry-ment, with The Upsetter delivering stream of concsiousness-vocals over some really dread riddims, ranging from drum and bass to serious roots. Highlights include the title track, loosely based on ""Punky Reggae Party"", the deep, rootsy ""Black Buster"" and the funky sing-a-long ""My name is!"". And ahh, his attack on Puff Daddy in ""Daddy Puff"" (""...' im a only a bluff""). Gotta love it."
3,Great idea and good execution,"What a great idea! Hundreds of your albums recorded onto this unit's hard drive and never mess with them again. It actually works - the IM-120 records a whole CD in about 10 minutes and it sounds good! It can record at 128kbps, 320kbps, or CD quality but the 320kbps sounds perfect!That display! That remote! For such a cool piece of hardware the main unit's display and the remote display are really hard to read. They get the job done, though - just have patience and let each keystroke complete. The remote's display is dim and the keypad seems a bit cheap.The IM-120's CD database is impressive - I've not had any CDs that are not in it, and I've loaded about 150 CDs. The CD player is quiet playing regular CDs but is kind of noisy when high-speed archiving.For its original list price ..., this was a cheaply-constructed, not-quite-ready-for-prime-time item, but for ...(Amazon's price) it is a cool repository for my CDs, if you can deal with some quirks."
4,Goose Pet Toy,"I actually use this with my cat, because he loves to hold things and kick them with his back feet. He tears this up every day, but it holds together well. He hasn't been able to destroy it yet. Besides which, the occasional honking when he squeezes it hard makes him go nuts."
1,Squeaker was not functional,"The squeaker inside the duck was not functioning correctly. This is a bummer, because it's the primary reason the dog likes the toy. Now he is going crazy trying to squeak it, which is wearing it out even quicker."
3,"Cute, but is no match to destructive terrier jaws.","My terrier mix pooch loved this toy, but it was completely dead and gutted within a few days. It may last longer for a calmer breed. Just beware."
3,too soon to rate,"I have only tried one recipe in this book so far and my family was't crazy about the results...but then, that isn't out of the ordinary for my family when we try new recipes...the book actually looks promising and I would have to try more recipes before I could write a real review of it; so don't go by my review"
5,Ability Development from Age Zero - Shinichi Suzuki,This is an absolutely ESSENTIAL book for all parents to read - and especially those who enter their children into music lessons with Suzuki Method trained teachers. Dr. Suzuki believed that all children were capable of learning to play music and could benefit from it in all areas of their lives. This book is an easy-to-read book that will guide any parent to encourage their child with love and patience.
5,Delicious!,These are by far the BEST gluten free brownie that we've tried in our home. It tastes like a gluten filled brownie!
3,"These reviews are Pre- company change! Good, no longer great","These were the BEST brownies and then the company was sold. Cheaper ingredients make for lesser brownies. I am ticked off that we celiacs, etc are paying BIG $$ for a product that is now being mass-produced and with lower quality ingredients. Shame on you. They are still good..not great."
5,These are AWESOME,I'm just starting g-free; I was expecting the food to taste weird/different. Well these are better than wheat brownies. I'd serve these to company in a second - and they'd just think they're really good brownies. Very highly recommended.
4,"Very Tasty, Very Simple","Don't want to over-hype this mix but it is very tasty and very simple. We have two active kids in sports and other activities. One of our biggest gluten-free challenges has been pot-lucks, team dinners, picnics... Lots of tasty things to eat, but nothing my kids can eat. We've started baking up a batch of these to take with us. Everybody gets something now. Highly recommended."
5,yummmm,These are just about the most sinfully delish brownies I have ever had..I made them with applesauce substitution and no one noticed they were fat free.....gluten free pantry makes the best mixes
2,what am i doing wrong?,This brownie mix came to us in a gift box and we loved them so we bought a case. Since then we have problems with them. Are they supposed to be oily and come out bubbly and liquidy? i don't remember them doing that the first time. It's like they separate- baked on the edges and goo in the middle- and it doesn't matter how long they are baked. We still eat them but i wonder if there's something wrong or if we're doing something wrong?!!
5,Brownie Heaven,"I have DH and need to eat gluten free, it's difficult. Many times I crave a good sweet and I feel deprived. Now that I found this brownie mix I make a patch, freeze them in individual servings, and have one brownie a day. The recipe is easy and the brownies are rich and flavorable. They're a chocolate lovers answer to having a yummy snack and staying gluten free. I love them."
5,Taste like the real thing,"These brownies are delicious, period. I didn't even follow the instructions (forgetting to whip the eggs before I added them) and they turned out wonderful. If only all gluten free products tasted this great!"
5,Yummy!,"These are so good, most people don't even know they are gluten-free. Very rich and chocolatey. My daughter loves them!"
5,Gluten -Free Pantry Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix,You can't tell this from the wheat brands. Mix makes a wonderful moist brownie. I sometimes add nuts. These are wonderful. Can be made ahead and frozen for a fast treat later or for lunches. Really wonderful Products.The whole family really love these.
5,Good Stuff,This is a great product. The price is really good compared to the off the shelf in the store price. It tastes like regular brownies.
5,Gluten Free Pantry,"These mixes are excellent for people with gluten issues. The Chocolate Truffle Brownie Mix is by far thebest of all their products and I have been using it for 3 years. These are superb, even though they aregluten free. Add chopped pecans and they are even better. Just make sure you follow the directions andfreeze before cutting.The price is excellent also, much better than any store I shop in."
2,Disappointing,"I bought the six pack case and after baking the first two boxes I am confident that I won't be purchasing this again. If you are looking for chocolate decadence, you won't find it here. The next box I will try with regular oil not melted butter/margarine as directed. Maybe then I'll get that chewy, gooey richness that this products claims. There is a strange aftertaste, not one that I wish to linger. Betty Crocker G/F brownie mix is by far a better tasting brownie and less expensive. My vote is G/F with Betty C!"
1,Did not like taste,"Kids thought it was just ""okay"", but I did not like it at all. Odd taste. Love their white cake/cookie mix. That's fabulous."
5,An Excellent View into a Career in Biology,"I am stuck in what can only be called (generously) a mid-career crisis and changing to a career in biology is one of the possible directions I've been considering. Reading this book not only helped me to understand what life would be like if I chose to pursue a career in biology but it also talked about the details of a life that are hard to learn from the outside: the world-view, the ethical code, the experience of the daily life of a biologist. One of the best things I learned from this book is that for a person interested in biology there are many options, including being a devoted amateur. I still don't know what the future holds for me. This book was only one piece of the puzzle but it is an important piece and the lessons I learned go beyond biology."
2,Soundtrack? What soundtrack?,"Why is this album called a soundtrack? Many of the tracks that were featured in the film were ""mixed"" to death so as to be unrecognizable and four tracks weren't even heard in the film, but were included in this album. And some of the music from the film never made it onto the album at all (""Such a Lot of Living"", the piano music during the softball games, the cover of ""Top of the World"").No soundtrack I ever bought was subjected to such a hatchet job. Maybe the producers should have called it ""A couple of tunes from 'The Broken Hearts Club'""--that's about right!"
1,Soundtrack....to what?,"As another reviewer mentioned, this is one big BAD cliché . Some of these songs aren't even in the picture! As anyone knows, music sets the mood of a film. I bought this soundtrack because I liked that mood, but that's not what I got. Instead its oneTRULY AWFUL dance mix after another. DULL DULL DULL. If you're looking for any of the songs from this film, better to find them somewhere else."
3,A question about the music?,Does anyone know what the piano music was during the first baseball scene. I think is was Scarlatti? Anyone? Thanks.
1,Yawn,"Yawn. Cliches galore fill the soundtracks to all ""gay"" films. Apparently every gay male worships disco and dance music and does nothing but part and dance, dance and party. Maybe one day there will be such a movie and soundtrack that will ignore all the tired old stereotypes, but this isn't it. Same old, same old."
5,thanks,Thanks for the good service! We received the book in record time and have so enjoyed it! We will probably find another book to order soon.
1,HORRIBLE TECH SERVICE,Bought the 250 GB product in 2007 for $100. Dead by 2009. I/O Magic tech support can barely speak english and spends more time trying to derail your attempt at complaining. HORRIBLE COMPANY AND HORRIBLE PRODUCTS.Beware of any product made by them.
1,Multiple Technical Problems - 3 device failures!,"I bought the 4GB product in Sep 05 and it went bad just before the warranty period ended. After a long drawn out process with technical support and having to contact Best Buy to get my original receipt (who saves receipts for these for a year?), they replaced the product for free. The second product lasted only two months. Same process again. They sent an 8GB at no charge. The 8GB lasted for 8 months. Now they won't replace it since it is well past the 12 months of original purchase date. Note however, that all three failed before owning them for 12 months. All data including my Master's Thesis, all pictures and music are gone. If you are looking for a long term solution for backup, I highly discourage buying this product."
1,Beware of the GigaBank 8.0 Hard Drive,Very poor quality; drive stopped working after 2 months.A Gigabank 4.0 drive I had also stopped working suddenly after 2 years-overheated. Data Recovery is incredibly expensive and difficult to achieve. You are taking a big risk using any GigaBank product from I/O Magic; never again for me (I made a big mistake trusting them).
1,Similar experience--AVOID THIS!,I bought one of these a couple of weeks ago and had the same experience of a dead unit and long wait for IOmagic support to tell me the thing was dead. I received a replacement and bought an extended warranty as I expect this to keep happening. AVOID.
1,Short life span!,"Guess I should have researched this item before I impulse purchased it. Like many others have experienced, mine worked great for 2 weeks then was suddenly unrecognizable by any computer. After talking with I/OMagic tech support for a ridiculous amount of time they concluded what I told them to begin with: it's dead. Fortunately I can return it for a full refund rather than getting a replacement unit. I'd stay away from this item if I were you."
3,Be sure to read the description well!!,"While I am sure this is a fine set, I was not prepared when I opened box to see that the saucepans and stockpot do not have the non-stick surface. The on-line description of the set provided does detail that fact but you might not read it carefully enough to really pick up on it. The on-line picture shows the saucepans with their lids on (so you can't see the inside)while the frying pans clearly show their black non-stick surface. Anyway, just be aware that you may not be getting what you think you are."
3,Stainless pots scorch easily,"We bought the set one year ago that did not include the non-stick frying pans, so we have no experience with those items. We were looking for a dishwasher-safe cookware set. This stainless cookware looks beautiful out of the dishwasher, except for the interior bottoms of the uncoated pots and pans. They scorch easily, which means frequent hand-washing with a scrubbing pad. Be aware that the non-stick frying pans are polished aluminum (not stainless steel) and will quickly discolor when washed in a dishwasher.Otherwise, this is a nice set of cookware. It just required more effort to clean than we wanted."
1,Absolutely useless,"They had spliced on the right cable, which was fine, but it was too short to reach the connector! an amazing oversight; fortunately Amazon made no trouble taking the item back.Has since been classified as not suitable for my vehicle, so might have been an Amazon problem."
3,It's ok...,"The dvd has some extra songs that weren't included in the original VHS, which is a nice little bonus. But a few of the songs from the VHS are NOT included in the dvd. Off the top of my head I remember there was a song about bedtime that is no longer included. I assume it was taken out because they have a dvd specifically for bedtime songs, but it's still a little annoying. The dvd has an option to put the songs on a loop which is nice, but we haven't tried it yet.The songs are old, from the 80's, and kind of silly, but they are geared toward preschoolers and are perfect for that age group. All in all it's a fun dvd."
5,the original and the best,"My kids 5, 2 and 1 love this DVD. I catch myself singing the songs along with them. Great educational entertainment!"
5,Baby Stops Crying!,Our little girl loves BabySongs. She can be in the middle of a tantrum and flipping this on will cause it to cease instantly! Our new travel DVD player makes this DVD even better on long car trips when she starts to get fussy.
5,Nana's best purchase,"My granddaughter goes to daycare everyday and has to watch this video every day. She, along with 2 other little ones, are about to drive the daycare mom insane. They have to watch it over and over. So I decided to step in and save the daycare mom. I purchased it for my granddaughter to view at home. Now my Son and his wife are going insane. I love being a Grandmother LOL!"
4,My son loves it ...,"My cousin gave this to us as a gift. It sat on a shelf until I finally gave in on videos when my son was 19 months. He absolutely loves it and will watch no other video. The video is engaging for a toddler--very low budget but of real kids running around doing stuff--and the songs range from entertaining to instructive. I only have one criticism. There is a song on the video about needing a blanket as a security object. If the blanket is taken away for washing, the child might be ""lonely"", ""scared"", ""get angry"" or ""cry"". The song does nothing but model insecurity for children who don't presently feel it and reinforce it for those who do. I was horrified when my son ran to get a blanket from his room while watching this song. He hasn't done that since but I could see this being a big influence on kids. The song should go. Otherwise it keeps my son out of my hair for a half an hour."
5,Baby Songs - original Hap Palmer.,"We had this VHS for my five other grandchildren, especially good for training them. Purchased this for twin 2 1/2 twin girls. So glad I was able to get another copy. Thanks."
1,Not Genuine,"This was NOT the version of Baby Songs as depicted in the photo. It was a poor quality copy of a later version of this VHS compared it to the original copy which I own from my own children. Wanted a back-up for my grandchild, very disappointed!"
4,does not contain all the songs from More baby songs,While I enjoyed this DVD. It does not contain the all of the songs from the video More Baby Songs as is reported in some reviews. I bought this based on those reviews because those were the songs my kids wanted (they wore our video out) and only 3 of the songs are included. Just be aware.
5,Baby Songs DVD,"Our kids have always loved this series of videos, but have worn our the VCR copies. This DVD is a compilation of three different videos, and has the advantage that it doesn't wear out when played over and over. An excellent choice."
1,not very brave,"Bob James - the mastermind of smooth Jazz. ""H"", ""Touchdown"", ""Grand Piano Cannyon"". Eternal pieces of Art. Brave and thoughtful new directions in Jazz. We owe him a lot.But the recent releases of Fourplay -including ""X"" - don't meet my expectations at all: predictable, repetitive, overproduced Computer-music.The typical Fourplay sound squeezed out like a lemon in another CD.Larrys guitar playing takes a nice direction on ""Tournabout"" - but then the song falls back again to old routine. ""Screenplay"" is a good one (one of two songs that were done by Bob). The rest, hmm... some nice solos constricted in predictabiltiy.Don't get me wrong, I like all of the guys. Every single member of the group has done great things in the past.So - a bit more breveness, Yes Please!"
1,Waste of money,"I was very eager to buy this CD. I have the CD Elixir and I love it. I saw and heard fourplay in Atlanta and they were awesome. However, this CD has too much computerized music. Too many sythensized voices. Very predictable. In my estimation, a bunch of tracks to play on smooth jazz radio stations or in an elevator as mindless filler. I didn't care for this one at all."
3,"When these four get together, magic happens (mostly)","(3 & 1/2 stars) This new fourplay disc is called ""X,"" as in roman numeral ten, I guess. Can it really be ten CDs already? (Actually it isn't... they must be counting their Best Of album too. I believe X is only their ninth studio album.) The musicianship is always excellent on fourplay releases, and X sparkles with superb playing from all four guys. At times it drifts a little too far toward the blander side of Smooth Jazz (i.e., near elevator music) -- the reason for my slightly lower rating. ""Twilight Touch"" and ""My Love's Leavin'"" are a couple of tunes that cross over that too-smooth boundary. Elsewhere, when that threatens to happen, as with the cheesy synths on ""Turnabout,"" the song is lifted back up by a lively melody and/or some inspired soloing from one of the quartet. I've always loved Larry Carlton's guitar sounds, and there's a lot of that good stuff to soak in on X. Overall, the CD has more up than down, but it's not a clean winner."
3,"All Great Musicians, but..........","This CD has some of my favorite people playing on it. It's my opinion that the project should have picked a path and stuck to it. I would have enjoyed either path. Michael McDonald is one of the best! Larry Carlton and Bob James need no explanation from anyone. They have earned everyones love and respect. Nathan East and Harvey Mason are two people I'm not familar with but if they're on the same project with the former two, well.... that says it all. All I would ask is-Do a project with songs like Michaels(a masterpiece, by the way!) or just songs like all the others on the CD. I like both, but I don't feel they are compatiable. Just my opinion."
5,Smooth Wonderland,"All the tracks on X are fantastic and so smooth that I find it hard to pick out a favourite. Since purchasing X, it's not left my car CD player. Although, a big Fourplay fan, I would recommend this to any smooth jazz lover or a new entrant to the genre. They say Kind of Blue must have been made in heaven. In my reckoning, X by Fourplay, is not far off from heaven as well.AghoghoLondon, UK"
3,X,"One of Fourplay's best album in years.I thought when I was listening to the song Eastern Sky, I thought it was Pat Methany playing instead of Fourplay. Nathan East's vocal/scatting work on some of the songs are getting a little tiresome though."
5,Just Awesome Cd of Fourplay,I feel this Fourplay just sparles & brings out all of there talents. What awesome grooves with the Guitars. This Fourplay is as awesome as there previous Cds they just keep getting better & better on each cd they put out. Its a must buy cd. I give it 5 stars.
2,A great book for twelve-year-olds,"The world is waiting for a comprehensive, objective, thorough review of the history and characteristics of the Countach. This isn't it. Dron manages to show a lot of (not very good) pictures, write a lot of babble, and skimp on substance. He also manages to throw in a few gratuitous insults of Enzo Ferrari and Ferrari cars... hardly a sign of objective reporting.It's a fine book for twelve-year-olds with Countach posters on their bedroom walls, I suppose; a serious student of Italian exotics or a serious potential Countach buyer will derive little of value from this volume."
3,"Some False Advertising, but has Heart of Humanity","The set is disappointing on one hand, because despite the advertising, the only silent movies that are really in the set are In the Border States, Birth of a Nation, and Hearts of Humanity- so Four Horseman and Hearts of the World are missing. But for fans of the genra, the set is worth it for Hearts of Humanity- a good transfer, at a good speed, with good music, of a good film."
3,Old war stories need to be clear.,"The features are good, but they need enhancement to a clearer visual view and more up to date audio to improve on the visual as well as the content."
5,Totoro,Great Totoro stuffed animal! It was larger in size than I expected. Totoro is so cute and cuddly. This was a great buy
5,Karajan's Phenomenal Wagner,"This CD contains the exact same performances and the exact same remastering as the EMI ""Great Recordings of the Century"" release. The only difference is that the tracks are reordered. I have reviewed that Karajan CD and my review stands for this CD too, since it is the same thing in different packaging.These are some of the most passionate, romantic and utterly thrilling performances of Wagner orchestral music you can hope to hear. Herbert von Karajan was the greatest conductor alive at the time these recordings were made and the Berlin Philharmonic was the greatest orchestra in the world. United in Wagner's music, they send chills up the spin. The sound is great, for such a cheap price you can't be without this recording whether you buy it here in the ""Karajan Collection"" or the ""Great Recordings of the Century""."
3,"Looks great, gasket sucks and bolts too long","Other reviews have said the bolts are too long for some Fords. I have a 93 F-350 and they were too long. The gasket is a piece of cardboard and I think I will need to replace it soon because its already leaking.ALTHOUGH, For this price for the quality of the cover itself this is a great deal. Looks Great!"
2,wrong part,"Amason said this part would fit my truck when I ordered it,However when I tried to install this it would not fit my truck. I contacted the manufacturer and they said it was the wrong part. Returned item for a refund. well made cover, good crome finish, great price, too bad it fit my truck !!!"
5,A Compelling Chronicle,"I picked this book up as a fan of Stephen Fry and Rik Mayall who was curious to learn about the Cell Mates incident. Simon Gray's book is a well written and informative look at the process of play writing and theatre production. Although I chose this book to learn more about Stephen Fry, I was surprised at the kind of insight given by Gray about Fry and all the actors involved in the production. This is especially true in the case of Mayall, someone largely forgotten in the wake of the play's failure and is portrayed as vastly different than he appears to his fans. He is according to Gray highly emotional and uncomfortable being himself which is a stark contrast to his onscreen and onstage persona. i recommend this to anyone interested in the Cell Mates disaster, Stephen Fry and Rik Mayall."
5,Careful!! Very addicting.,I saw these at a 7-11 and decided to try them. I am always tring new things. After eating a few I couldn't stop until the can was gone. Went back to 7-11 and bought the only other can they had. I have been stopping at every 7-11 I pass to look for them. No luck though so I searched the web. I shop a lot on Amazon but never thought about finding Wasabi Peas here. Shipping and handling a bit high for a 1.99 can so I will keep searching. Love these things.
5,One of my favorites of all time!,"This book was my favorite growing up. I read it when I was 7 or 8 and again and again and again. Somehow, I've lost my well-worn copy, but as soon as I find it again it will go up on my daughter's shelf for her to read, when she comes of age."
5,A must read for Junior Officers,"I found this book at a Community Flea Market whilst on holiday christmas 98. As an Australian Vietnam Veteran (1966/67)and a Retired Army Warrant Officer I usually do not read ""gungo ho"" war books.On reading the back cover of the book and discovering that this was a true story about this young platoon commander at the siege of ""Khe Sahn"" I could not put this book down, it is a must read for every platoon commander or officer cadet.I was glad that I did not serve at Khe Sanh, it makes my one year tour look like a picnic."
3,Good for Mobility,"I've been giving my aging dog this supplement for years, and it has been very good for his mobility. However, when we ran out recently, I realized it was also the cause of his acid reflux issues... we switched to something else.I'd say keep an eye on any stomach issues. Doesn't appear to be common - my dog is the only one in our senior dog community with any reaction to the Synovy."
1,Unsafe Product due to FDA failure by manufacturer,"FDA inspection Failed so the manufacturer was forced to stop production. It's not safe to feed to your pets. I ordered the same thing, just different type (tabs instead of granules) but was only informed after the sale why it was discontinued."
3,Didn't agree with my Heeler,"My dog ate this up with her dry food and a little water stirred up to make a gravy, for about 5 days she ate it and then she refused and would not eat it any more... I think the MSM (anti-inflammatory) may disagree with her stomach because I have given her another product in the past, a pill with glucosamine and MSM and she did the same thing. It's a shame because it did help with her getting up and down more easily and having more zip in her step, but I won't force it on her when she so obviously is repelled. I think I need to try something without MSM and wait a couple months for results instead of instant results like the MSM gives."
4,Synovi G3 Granules enhance movement,"I have used this product on two geriatric dogs with arthritis and one adult dog with hip dsyplasia for a year, and I can attest to the fact that it works. It is not an instantaneous cure... it takes about two weeks to kick in, but once it does, it makes the difference between your dogs being able to walk versus not being able to get up. It also is not cheap, but I believe you get what you pay for (though I wouldn't mind a coupon once in a while). I use the granules, and at first you start with two scoops a day and put it right in their dog food with a little water, then once you start seeing results, you can cut back to one scoop a day. I know it works because a couple of times I ran out, and a few days later, my dogs were feeling it and showing it."
4,"So far, so good.","The dogs don't really seem to mind this supplement, it comes in a nice little bucket with a scooper, and it looks like coffee granules.They eat everything in their bowl. It's kinda hard to tell if it's working,but they are active and hopefully they will continue to be that way."
5,Absolute Best for Ur Best Friend,"Great Price !Great Delivery Time !The Absolute Best Pet Suppliment for Ur Best Friend ... Your Dog.Buy Here, or pay more somewhere else."
5,great product,"I've been using this on my 2 german shepherds for years- one with bad hips and one with good hips as a precaution, the dog with the bad hips gets it twice a day and does really well with exercise, med and decreased weight"
5,Sadie loves it!,This product has dramatically helped my dog. She was limping and had a hard time getting up. Not anymore. Half the price the vet charges! I put one scoop on her food and mix hot water with it to make a gravy. She loves her soup!
1,"I love the popcorn, too bad I can't get it through Amazon","Twice they sent me cartons of the wrong variety. Once it was ""Movie Theater Butter,"" forgot what they sent the other time.I was credited back for my purchase, because they are unable to receive returned food products. They never were able to successfully fill the order, and we gave up.I love this particular product, it contains 0% transfats, low salt, yet it is delicious and tastes as sweet as candy to me.Unfortunately, I will have to rely on my local supermarket, which is often out of the product"
4,Interesting and sequential story of the economy,"I listened to this on the internet before I bought the DVD. I thought the DVD would have more information than what I could find online, but there is not that much other information available. It could be there is more information in the book. I was looking for some ideas in terms of a solution. There is really not much there. I thought the lecture was spot on historically and valuble to listen to."
5,Gotta See This,"I was born into a world of corrupt politicians, during the Kennedy assassination & the big Nixon Watergate scandal, so all I've ever known is how screwed up our own government is. I stopped watching mainstream television in the late 80's - and recently only watch documentary films, since they seem to be more of the real news that we are not getting in the media. This DVD ended up in my hands this past weekend and I am very thankful. It is an eye opener, big time. It is very informative and explains a lot of what I didn't understand. I highly recommend this film."
5,a fun education,"One of the best lecturers I've ever heard, he uses humor and everyday situations to illustrate some complex economic ideas. He makes it easy to understand the causes of the market crash in 2009, why it's defferent from the Great Depression, and how we can choose, as consumers, to avoid another recession. A few charts, easy to understand. He ends with a thought-provoking idea about using Marxian economics to build a stronger economy. Everyone I shared this with enjoyed it and had new revelations about why things happen in the labor market."
5,Ignore Marx at your Peril - Restore the New Deal to save Capitalism from Itself,"This is a great lecture that reminds us that Karl Marx would not be at all surprised at how deregulated capitalism is so good at imploding in only a few decades. So ok ok Marx's utopian solution fantasies dont work, we get it, enough already, but you cannot deny that the self destructive nature of capitalism was not analysed by Marx in excruciating detail and that Sept 18 2008 proved him right in his analysis. Professor Wolff argues persuasively that we always will need a New Deal type of structure to regulate capitalism to keep it from destroying itself by decoupling labor's productivity from wages to increase profits."
5,Nice basket,"I purchased this as a gift for my neighbor. It is beautiful, seems sturdy, and fit her stairs perfectly."
3,Kind of pricey for the quality,"I bought this basket for our cabin as we have one at home and have used it for years. I had trouble finding another stair basket, but found this one and decided to try it. It was a little expensive for the sturdiness of it and I don't expect it to last as long as the one we have at home. But it does serve it's purpose and it roomy enough to hold everything we want. Would have liked it to have a liner, though. The straw tends to get caught on blankets/etc.."
4,stair basket,"Great price but basket isn't as sturdy as the last one we had. Shipping was a bit slow (don't understand why it should take a week+ to ship out a product??), but I wasn't in a hurry so it wasn't a problem--just FYI."
2,Basket review,"I ordered this basket for my daughter for Christmas and sent it directly to her. When I talked to her on Christmas Day, she said she was very happy with it. It was just what she had in mind and she was very happy that it had handles for easier toting upstairs. Thanks."
4,The Stabbing in the Stables,"The Stabbing in the Stables was the third book by Simon Brett that I have read.I find the stories well written in a typical English setting. The main characters, Jude and carole, are recognizable and likeable. All in all a pleasant read.The Stabbing in the Stables (Fethering Mystery)"
4,read,I think this is crap that they make you write so many words when one will do! they need to change this or I am going to stop reviewing books! you should be allowed to say what you want to say even if it is one word!
3,Overall a good read,Good story line. I could have done without so much detail on the romance part of it. There's only so many times I can enjoy hearing about how great his chest looked. Definitely written by a woman. Overall a good story though.
3,Caught in the act critique,"This book is very avearge. Not one I had trouble putting down, but not awful. It is somewhat cliche and Jessie was a tad annoying, but there were points when it had me very curious. It's an ok read."
3,Soft Cover,This is somewhat a soft protective cover. It doesn't stay on very well. I was hoping to keep the cover on the fish finder/GPS while trailering but it will either blow or vibrate off.
5,"Great history, photographs,& biographies","This is a wonderful book for anyone with an interest in golf course design and construction or in the history of the game itself. First and foremost the book is about the people who shaped the game.Over 30 designers active from 1890-1940 are profiled with biographies, contributions to golf and examples of their work. Many never before published photographs are highlights of the book.You will see great views of the classic courses with scenes under construction and during play, and such unusual hazards as furrowed bunkers and chocolate drop mounds. Many original designers' drawings are also included.A series of original paintings adds color and life to some of the legendary holes. This is fascinating reading that will immerse you in the history of the great golf courses that are as viable today as when they were created."
3,Child's Seahawk Sweatshirt,After 2 washings the stitching around the Seahawks has started to ravel. For the price I feel this should not be happening.
4,Clara Schumann: Piano Music,Clara Schumann: Piano Music is a very good recording with the amazing Yoshiko Iwai. I dare say that I had never heard of Clara Schumann and I must admit that it came to me as a surprise that she too was a composer. Naxos has done an ok job with the book-let but the text is a bit small and the photo as well. The picture on the front is nice if a bit uninspired. The essay is well-written but the english section does not list an author. Even so I give this recording 4 well-deserved stars.
3,not bad,i bought this reciever about 14 months ago at best buy i thought it lacked a few features like on screen gui but otherwise it was a solid preformer about 6 months into owning it the remote stoped working then about 8 months into owning it when i had it on the volume would start to turn up or down on its own and then about 1 month ago it stoped working when you turn it on it displayes dsp ng what ever that means any how i think this one was a lemon i would still recomend pioneers products just get an extended warrenty with it
2,Wasnt the movie we thought it was,My husband and I go this thinking it was a different movie. We didn't like the movie... it got turned off after about 5 minutes.
4,We liked the show,"We liked the interaction of the actors, and the story line--but mostly, we loved the song of the movie, also entitled, Parellel Lives. Don't know why they didn't release the song as a single. We had searched for it, but guess no one ever recorded it. What a shame!"
3,Markets Unbound- Too optimistic,"This book makes some interesting points and is well written. I feel that the authors are too optimistic about the affects of globalization on the world economy. Issues like disparity in income and ravaging affects on the middle class are not given the attention they should. I would also have liked to see more opinions on what world governments could do to alleviate the sweeping changes the world markets are making. Still, the book is worth reading for anyone interested in the affects of globalization."
5,Good purchase,The book was as described. Was a childhood favorite of mine. Now my son can enjoy it as well. Thank you!
4,"This is a classic ""backwards"" story","This is the classic story where a girl comes home from a school trip and tells her mother what happened - but backwards and forwards in that roundabout way kids have, skipping half the details. Her mother has to try to fill in the gaps that way.The illustrations are a riot. This one is definitely a keeper."
4,a funny book for kids under 12,"This book, ""The Day Jimmy's Boa Ate the Wash,"" is a great book for young readers. This book is both funny and interesting in the minds of the little ones. It can also be used for a book for readers who have just learned to read. This book is about a field trip to a farm with an elementary school grade. It starts off when they have just got home and goes through the trip backwards. The illustration are used great to show what is being said when the family is talking. A parent with the child who wants to read, this is a must have book."
2,Story Yes...... Writing No,"Excellent story and thoughtful characters, though they are not lovable characters, the plot was great. Then the end of the story came and it was pretty pitiful for an ending. Ms. Hightower needs to work on her character development and continue to tell the story without getting side tracked like she does. The concept of the story is great and the plot keeps you glued to the pages, but that still does not save this book."
1,Poorly researched; poorly written.,"I was a bit surprised that I did not really care very much about the heroine, did not empathize with her. I was bothered by much of the plot; there were what I considered gratuitous killings-too many and not always necessary or predictable in the plot. The antagonist was under-developed as a character; the reader should have had more of a repulsion for her. Finally, as a Cincinnatian, I was appalled by the incorrect, sometimes ludicrous, information about Cincinnati. Since the author is from nearby Lexington, I was surprised, maybe amused, by this."
2,Great plot. Poorly researched. Poorly edited.,"Ms. Hightower has a brilliant mind for coming up with a plot. This story is great.However, for a Lexingtonian/Cincinnatian, she seems to know very little about the area, and after countless mistakes, it begins to grate on the natives.In a note to Ms. Hightower:1) The river separating Kentucky and Ohio, running through downtown Cincinnati, is the OHIO River, not the Kentucky River. 2) You cannot take Interstate 64 from Cincinnati to Lexington, as this is an east-west Interstate (easily known from its even number), and Lexington is south of Cincinnati (on I-75).3) In the 1990's, there was NEVER a mini-mart anywhere near Lynagh's, unless you are referring to the pitiful cigarettes'n'beer ""mart"" at the gas station behind it.Please see my comments regarding your next book in the review I'm leaving there."
2,*DID NOT LIKE*,"I WAS SO EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD A PRADA BAG! BUT IT REALLY IS LIKE ANY OTHER PLASTIC BAG...PLASTIC AND CRAPPY LOOKING. I LOVED THE HANDLES AND LEATHER TRIM BUT HEY, PLASTIC IS PLASTIC AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD FOR THE BEACH BUT I REFUSE TO PAY $125 FOR A BEACH BAG. I RETURNED IT."
2,Fan is not effective,"Ordered two fans. One was defective and other was n't effective.Another thing, they do not rotate."
1,HORRABLE GAYME,TIS GAYME WAHS HORRABLE! ITZ FUN-NESS WAS AZ GUD AZ THE GRAMMIR EN REVEWS ABOT IT! I LUVED TIS GAYME UNTIL EYE PRESD STRT! THEN I TUK A NAHP
2,Folk wisdom of Mexico.,I was very disappointed in this book. The Dichos have been sanitized and there are numerous mis-translations. Dichos as a rule are rather earthy.
4,Great toy,My son played with a similar toy made by Kenner over 40 years ago. Lego is great as is a meccano set but this toy provides an additional and different construction set with other buildings available as well.Glad to see it back on the market for my grandchildren now.
5,The Tekton Fire Station,"I haven't had this much fun building stuff since I was a kid! I recently found my old Girder And Panel airport set and saw the Tekton Fire Station set on Amazon via a search. I am so glad I bought it, it was like reliving old times and my nephew really loves it as much as I do. I am hoping to get another set to build an even bigger fire station. =o)"
4,Nice Clock & Thermometer,This is a nice outdoor clock and thermometer. It hangs nice and works well. I have had the hands get stuck a couple times but bending them back out fixed it.
4,Fear Reigns in Concarneau,"First one of the town's leading citizens is shot in the stomach in a doorway. Then his friends still inside the café barely escape being poisoned.Maigret shows his usual distain for evidence and deduction. He's more intrigued by the yellow dog wandering around the scene of the crimes - and the poignant face of the young barmaid who sleeps around a bit.More incidents occur. The reporters swarming all over the hotel seem to know more about the crime wave than the police!Maigret's flair for inaction, and his sensitivity to atmosphere, are nicely portrayed in this book."
2,Vera,"Was a bit disappointed with the quality of the recordings, but I suppose some of the songs were recorded many years ago ."
3,I Have Tasted the Sweet Mangoes of Cebu,"I am about ready to retire and have been doing background research on the possiblity of moving to the Philippines. On a website recently someone recommended this book as a way to begin to understand some of the Filipino mindset.This is an interesting book about a single man's efforts to ""return to his roots"" in the Philippines. The story, which at times is somewhat niave, does document the author's efforts to fall in love with a mail order bride.The book does give one a sense of the culture and of, I believe, the innocents of the sometimes Philippine ""hustle"". I recomend this book if one has any interest in the culture and of the people, both in the Philippines and those in the USA."
2,They break,"I had mine for less than a year and it simply stopped working and would not get a signal. I bought it from a [local store] which did not help things at all. I had to wait about a month before I actually came to the conclusion that tivo/hughes is bad. BR>I bought an UltimateTV 35hr and it is much better. It has nearly all the features that Tivo does, plus a program guide that goes further ahead, noticably better picture, slicker and slightly faster interface, and it's cheaper."
1,Don't buy! It is unreliable with no customer service.,Ours stopped working 3 months after purchase. Sent it back to Hughes for repair. 3 months later we are still waiting for a repaired unit. Customer service completely unhelpful.
1,LOUD? You betcha!,"I bought this unit as a second Tivo-DirecTV receiver for a really really low price due to the ""echo"" problem (if you have one Tivo unit and one non-Tivo receiver and both TVs are on the same channel---such as you're watching a sporting event and one person is cooking while the other entertains---then the sound comes out of the Tivo TV about one second behind the ""regular"" unit, which is marginally bothersome).I'm sorry I bought this model and it is going back. I love the Tivo service and my Philips brand unit is a dream. Luckily that's the one in the bedroom. This unit is identical in all respects but one: it has an el-cheapo hard disk with an audible hum. Audible over music. Audible 24/7. It's really annoying. Spend the extra bucks and get a real unit. You'll be very happy you did."
2,good unit - if you don't mind the noise,"altogether, it is a very user friendly receiver with great menu layout and tons of features. one major problem, though - it is LOUD. the noise that this thing makes while it is running is pretty incredible - a constant shrill, whining noise. and since the unit never powers off, you are forced to endure this noise constantly. maybe in a family room ... maybe, but certainly not for a bedroom (. . .)you get what you pay for. my advice is to spend the extra money and go with the sony tivo receiver (with mail-in rebate) - or go to ultimate tv for the better service and better receivers."
4,HOT Product - literally!,"Love my new Tivo unit!! Great features, easiest interface I've seen, very little noise as indicated before but it runs so hot it melted my access card! DirecTV has another on the way, but yikes! Make sure the unit has plenty of ventilation, especially when recording. I am now watching about 80% recorded content and 20% live - just opposite of before Tivo. There is occasional pixelation and the DirecTV guide is a little slow (better than my RCA), but overall a great product for the price."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.............,"A surprisingly dull and unimaginative group of dance tracks.I was introduced to Natacha Atlas' music through her album GEDIDA, which included a lively and varied mix of music. It seems to me that she's sold short by dj's who believe she should be used as one of a handful of instruments on these tracks, which are all glorified drum-machine solos with Atlas and synth-strings turned down low in the mix. I don't really think this qualifies as a Natacha Atlas album since her voice is only employed as a gimmick.I really can't even pinpoint one or the other of these tracks as a highlight; except for differences in tempo they are virtually indistinguishable from each other."
4,Sound Pitch a little off due to conversion process,"This is a great movie, I have it on VHS but wanted a version that would not wear out. However this copy was a conversion (Probably from PAL format) and the audio pitch is a little off, especially at the beginning."
5,Must see,If you love the 70's cartoons this is a series for you to watch. If you are a rick springfield fan don't miss out on the songs. The music is so catchy and the cartoons are what cartoon should be. My 6 years old loves the series and the music he starting singing along so kids will like it.
5,Mission Magic,"I'd give this one six stars if I could.Incredibly innovative sci-fi fantasy plots well animated by Filmation in the early 1970s. Miss Tickle (pun on ""mystical"") leads an animated Rick Springfield and her students on adventures into fantasy lands and alternate realms.Amazon also still has copies of the Mission Magic CD with the songs from the show, if you're interested.This one will be money well spent, and great kid-friendly material too."
4,Very Good Satellite Speakers,"I am using them in a space constrained home theater system as the left & right rear speakers in a 5.1 configuration. The front, center and sub-woofer are all JBL speakers and the Omnisats sound fine with them. I have the Omnisats sitting on end tables and they provide a reasonably realistic environment while taking up minimum space."
3,Nice but redundant,"This collection of hits from Dolly is a nice collection however, it is very redundant as there are already several hits packages out there with these very same tracks. The set is so redundant that it includes ""But You Know I Love You"" twice! Why is anyones guess. It's a budget release and really isn't essential to the die-hard fan."
2,dolly parton greatest hits,"I was dissappointed in this cd. it really didn't have the songs i wanted but, it was just ok."
1,A repackaging of repackaging!,"The one star review has nothing to do with the music, for all of the songs included are winners. But, RCA/BMG have repackaged Dolly's music so many times over the years, it appears that someone is getting so lazy that they're not even making the effort anymore. For this 2-disc collection is merely 2 previous collections: 1987's ""The Very Best Of,"" and 1997's ""Encore Collection,"" both two skimpy budget-line compilations. (That is why you find ""But You Know I Love You"" twice on here!) Save your money, there are many, many other and superior compilations of Dolly's music out there by RCA/BMG and Columbia/Sony (which have recently merged to one company, giving them shared access to Dolly's music from the mid 60s to late 90s!)"
4,Nice Product,"Have been using this microphone with the Fasttrack USB product to do home recording for the past month. I can find nothing wrong with it, has nice frequency range and sounds great on the recording that I have done so far. Works great with Session that I also purchased at the same time."
4,Solid Entry Level Dynamic Mic,"I am a hobbyist/non-professional musician who has used this mic for recording guitar amps as well as spoken-word vocals. Overall, it has met my expectations and suited my recording needs for half the price of the ""industry standard"" Shure mics.It has a full metal body with a quality feel. You will probably break the internal components before damaging the body. I've dropped mine a few times and have not had any problems.The cable they included was convenient, but the mic-stand clip that is included is a piece of garbage."
3,Kind of narrow,"These shoes are cute and will go with any outfit. They seem to run a little narrow, but I can still work with them. I like them non the less and will wear them often. Arrived just as the seller described and on time. Thanks!"
1,A Midsummernight Dream,This DVD is a travesty of Shakespeare. I have not one good word for it except that it is mercifully short.R. Bar-Chaim
2,CHEESY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS GAME WAS SORT OF STUPID (YOU SHOOT SOMEBODY 4 TIMES WITH AN AUTO-RIFLE AND THEN HAVE TO ARREST THE STUPID NEVER DIEING BAD GUYS AND IF YOU KILL THEM YOU`LL JUST ABOUT FAIL YOUR MISSION
2,rent it,This game has ok graphics for today's first person shooter standard. I don't like the fact that you can't just kill without saying freeze or something. It gets really old really fast. Rent it and beat it without spending the $50 or $40. Maybe wait until it drops down to $20. This game is cool because of the futuristic weapons and it's a squad based first person shooter. Just with some issues
5,This game will be awesome!,"After seeing various screenshots and multiple articles about this game, I think it will be very, very, very fun! You take the role as a SWAT team member and you command your team(actually BOTS) to do various things either through a headset or controller commands. The multiplayer on this game looks very fun because there are ten different levels that aren't in single player that you can play with a friend. There are gadgets, weapons, and as I assume, a great plot. I have NOT played this game but think it WILL be very cool!"
2,Poor SWAT sequel. Not the same standard at all.,"Wish I did not buy it because the game is really dull and not as good as the other SWAT series games because they have tagged on some sort of a silly story that is not as dramatic as ANY type of SWAT gameplay that we have done before. The graphics however are good and the control easy to use but the game lacks any serious tone or theme, does not have that many functions (3 guns, 5 types of grenades, some updates for guns earned by tokens after you complete a level and 4 or 5 orders you can give to your team mates [max of two only team mates!]). It plays more like some Arcade game as you move about the levels. It is a serious step back in the wrong direction for the SWAT series. I would recommend renting this before you choose to buy it. It is only just okay but the gameplay value is not there and it misses suspense completely. YAWN.Go buy SWAT 3 instead."
4,Nothing like what I expected,"If you're a fan of the Sierra computer series Swat then you're in for a surprise this game is really quite different from the Swat series.I was hoping this would be a take off from Swat 3 but it took a different twist. It's more like a shooter and I really didn't rely on by squad to much, rather I just had then open doors for me and when I was low on health I made them parade in front of me. One thing I didn't like about the game is the script, they had wierd lines were they were trying to act tough. It just didn't fit.One nice feture to the game is the gun upgrade, through out the course of the game you get points to use towards you upgrading your guns.This game could have been much better, oh well maybe next time."
3,"Serviceable, but a few drawbacks","The amount of space inside the oven was my main criteria for picking this product over others; most only boast enough room for a 12"" pizza, but the standard casserole and baking pans are 9""x13"". I have been quite pleased with how quickly it cooks food on the ""Convection"" setting. The ""Toast"" feature browns things on the top VERY quickly, so be prepared to flip your food after only a short amount of time. Also, it smells a little funny the first few times you use it.The burners on the top are a pain. They have only one temperature, high, but they take a very long time to heat up. My advice is to get independent burners with more options if you want to cook on a stove.The plastic knobs break off very easily, but a little Gorilla Glue fixes them well with no adverse side effects.Last complaint is that you cannot set the oven for more than 60 minutes."
3,"Great for makeshift kitchen, but poor quality construction","Purchased this to use during a kitchen remodel - the oven & 2 burners came in very handy and I could actually cook without relying exclusively on the microwave. Don't expect the same performance as from a conventional full-sized oven or stove, but it works fine. (I wouldn't use it to toast as it takes a while to heat up). Downside - the oven knob broke off unexpectedly - apparently cheap quality knobs. Overall it has served its purchase, but a knob breaking within the first few weeks of use is not indicitive of high quality."
4,Nice,Only used once for angel food cake. Hard to clean due to design. Pound cake would probably be fine though. Shipping was fast and easy.
4,Beautiful pan yields beautiful cakes,"This is my favorite pan for pound cakes and fruit cakes. The only trouble I've had is that the crust of the cake sticks slightly, be sure to grease and flour the pan generously (or use lots of one of the spray + flour products) -- use more than you think you'll need. It never seems to unmould 100% flawlessly, but with plenty of grease & flour the sticking will be so minimal as to be almost unnoticeable."
5,"Ogden, UT must like this Pan!","I noticed the 1st review of this item was from the same town where I live. Small world! This pan has a wonderful design, and it's quality is unsurpassed. I bake a lot, but around the holiday's it's a fun change of pace from the regular molds. Enjoy!"
5,Excellent Quality Cake or Jello tin,"I just love the design on this tin. The quality of the tin is excellent. No need for frosting as this cake's design is so lovely. Great product, great price and fast delivery."
3,sugary sweet yum yum.,"i bought this cd because i have way too many dark songs on my regular playlists. ie. morrissey, bauhaus, skinny puppy etc. which are awesome bands that have really stood the test of time with me, but i needed something a bit more upbeat and happy. this cd is perfect for that. happy upbeat catchy tunes with semi cheesy and a little bit sappy songs about love. great cd to get if you need a musical pick me up."
5,An inventive and compelling read!,"Rarely do I find a book that touches me the way this one does. It speaks to all of us who have felt like misfits in a world that cares so much about outward appearance and conformity.Benjamin, a young boy of 12, is a troubled child who escapes from his reality with his toy, a stuffed letter H he calls Elliot. It seems his toy is his only companion, and the only thing Benjamin allows to share in his imaginative but unbalanced life. Through letters from Benjamin's camp counselors, parents and from Benjamin to Elliot, we find how a lonely young boy adapts when his world is stolen from him. Moving and beautifully written."
4,A great look into a child's mind,"There are so many kids who just don't fit in and who live by rules set by their own minds. Unfortunately many people do not take the time to find out what's going on with those kids and dismiss them as troublesome. H's Benjamin is one of those special kids and luckily, the author of H allows us time to get to know him and to understand him -- and to see why he's worth getting to know. I can't recommend it enough."
5,H is a whimsical journey,"This is the most brilliant and cleverly crafted short novel, alternating between letters to and from a mentally-distraught boy's parents and his camp counselors and his diary entries, as he writes to his stuffed letter H. The premise is so imaginative, but most impressive, it captures the inner world of someone struggling with mental demons perfectly, and you, the reader, go there, too. It is impossible to put it down once you've picked it up, the lyrical writing captivates."
2,Wait for the next one,"Elizabeth Shepard has a lot of talent, but H. is not her book. Rather, it is a mixture of seemingly purloined stereotypes about idiot-savant kids, and fussily compassionate parents. In this collection of letters that centre around a ""retarded kid"", only a precious few really hit home. In most of the book you can see that the author ""wrote"" these letters. Books like Please Don't Say Hello and Fantastical Dr. Canterbury are much finer and more realistic portrayals of what most people would call ""madness"". In the meantime, wait for Mrs. Shepard's second novel."
2,Read the ingredients,"This is just a hyped up protein blend with leucine, creatine, and phenylalanine added. Adding ""gene"" after a chemically altered form of leucine doesn't make it any more active and no publicized studies have given any evidence that this is better than whey protein and a $5 bottle of l-leucine that will last all year. Mtech are greedy b@st@rds and I for one will no longer be suckered by their glossy marketing schemes."
1,Useless!,"I am a fan of Muscle Tech products, especially Cell-Tech and Nitro-Tech so I decided to give this a try. The taste is below average and it did nothing for me! Save your money or go buy some Cell-Tech if you want something effective."
2,Was good while it lasted...,"I bought this for my sister. We used it to transfer a Chao I had in Sonic Advance to her copy of Sonic Adventure 2 Battle and it worked fine. A few days later we tried using the GBA-to-GBA cable it had to trade Pokemon, and it didn't work. We tried the GC-to-GBA cable, and that didn't work either. Now I have a Chao that's stuck in a game I don't have, and an upset sister with a third-party accessory that doesn't work. Please buy the official ones from Nintendo, no matter how much more they cost. I wish I did."
2,Farberware 4 cup egg poacher,The knob on top of the lid gets extremely HOT. Usually the knob stays relatively cool. Also the egg took longer to cook than the stated 4 minutes - more like 6 1/2 minutes. The egg would look cooked on the top and sides but the bottom was raw. I would not recommend this poacher.
1,This poacher sucks,"I don't get the bad smell others have reported but no matter what I do the eggs stick in the stupid plastic cups, they are NOT non-stick. Who cares if the pan and lid are coated with non-stick material, the eggs cook in the stick for sure plastic cups. Unless you crave being frustrated, DO NOT buy this one."
2,Plastic-scented eggs!,"Yech! The first time I used this poacher I had eggs that had a strange scent and taste. As one other reviewer noted, I deduced this came from the plastic cups. So I soaked and washed and soaked and washed and soaked and washed. To no avail-- my eggs STILL smell funny and taste sort of weird. I will be replacing this with something that has metal egg cups. Other than the scent and taste imparted to my eggs, this works well. I guess a food stylist might find it handy for making pretty, photograph-ready INEDIBLE eggs."
1,Not Farberware quality,"Don't waste your money or time. This poacher doesn't do what the package implies. The egg cups are plastic and besides the odor, the eggs stick no matter what you do. Cleaning is impossible, and I doubt if the plastic is a healthy material to cook eggs in."
1,Undone,"Very attractive appearance of product, but the egg cups are a thick plastic and poor conductor of heat, so it cooks poorly. I replaced it with a poacher with metal cups. I consider it useless. It takes way too long to produce a poached egg and even then the egg is not quite right."
1,"Don't buy this, read the reviews first!","I wish I'd read the reviews before I bought this thing. You can spray a half gallon of no-stick spray in to these egg cups...it is moot. It is IMPOSSIBLE to clean the egg cups...soak them, spray them, scrape them. I just tossed the entire thing in the trash and ordered a better made one, with NON STICK egg cups. Item is JUNK!I can't rate this a ZERO on Amazon's scale. It is a big fat ZERO."
1,Read the Reviews!!!!,"I usually read the reviews before making a purchase and for some reason I didn't on this one. Don't waste your money!!! The plastic cups are the worst. Egg yellows were solid and whites were not cooked, alot of water build up."
1,Save Your Money,This Farberware 4 cup plastic egg cup poacher just doesn't work. The most critical part of the egg poacher is the egg cups. They are plastic. Your egg will stick to them and it is done on top but not in between. Why anyone would produce an egg poacher with plastic cups is beyond me. Save your money! It doesn't work!
1,Dangerous Product! Don't purchase.,"I bought this egg poacher for my Grandson because he loved the eggs I made for him at my house with a poacher that has steel cups. The Faberware poacher has plastic cups that cause the eggs to stick. Worse, if you happen to allow the pan to go dry, the cups melt in less than a minute. After the cups melted, I placed one of them in the fireplace and it easily burned.Farberware Aluminum Nonstick 4-Cup Egg Poacher Skillet"
1,One of the cups melted,"On the second use, one of the cups melted to the pan...enough said. Don't waste your money. Guess I have to write 20 words to post, but really if the cups melt, there not much use of the pan."
1,"Yes, it's pretty bad","I wish I had read these reviews before buying this. They're pretty much on the money. The cup frame is very thin and flimsy. The cups are small, but at least they're a bit deeper than most other poachers. And it's those cups where this really fails. All the metal is non-stick, but the parts that NEED to be non-stick, the cups, are plastic. If you don't oil them, you will NOT be able to get the eggs out in one piece. Another problem is that the cups don't transfer heat very well. The tops of the eggs will cook firm (from the steam captured by the lid) but the bottom of the eggs are still liquid. My old all-metal poacher cooked eggs just the way I like them in 3 min, 30 secs. After 6 minutes, the bottom of the eggs were still liquid, which I had to sop up off the place with a paper towel. My old poacher is a second-hand Fagor, and the cups' non-stick coating was damaged by the original owner, so I've been trying out replacements. This isn't it."
1,One star is way too high a rating!,"What a piece of junk. Luckily I bought mine at a local store -- it was half-off b/c it was a used return, plus I had a 20% coupon on top of it. Too bad I didn't keep the receipt -- it would be back in a heartbeat. The one-star reviews are spot-on... the eggs stick and worst of all, the egg doesn't cook properly. I have not had one egg that was edible out of this pan. What a waste."
2,Waste of money,"Why did they spend the money to make the pan itself non-stick and then make the egg cups plastic? Will be sending this back. Packaging leads you to believe that the entire unit is non-stick, until you open the pan. Even if you grease the cups, the eggs stick. Plastic does not conduct heat well, so the eggs take twice as long to cook. Removing the eggs is tedious at best. Cleaning the egg cups is very time consuming. Not worth the money."
1,Bad Product,"My girlfriend bought this egg poacher online because we could not find one in the stores around here. This poacher worked good for maybe 3 times then the eggs stared sticking to the so called ""Nostick"" cups. It doesn't matter what we do the eggs stick to the cups. Do not buy this junk."
1,Plastic on a stovetop??!!!,"The egg cups are 100% plastic. Why would the manufacturer make a stovetop item out of plastic? This simply doesn't work. The plastic cups eventually melted. The eggs stick to the plastic. Please save your money. Williams-Sonoma sells a quality poacher with metal, nonstick cups. It's well worth paying a little more for something that will last."
1,eggs stick and cups are impossible to clean,"Bought this product yesterday and returned it today. As many reviewers said:1.Plastic does NOT work: eggs stick; they don't cook through; they smell of plastic.2. Impossible to clean: I did butter the cups, still it it was very hard to scrape the eggs from the cups. Looked very unappealing. And cups were ipmossible to clean.Bought a new poacher today: Calphalon egg poacher. Will see how this one works."
2,fair,"so so product, does poach eggs. Not a ""man"" friendly pan. The eggs stick, and it is not easy to get the cups out of a hot pan. My husband is not impressed."
3,Gets the job done,"Having used metal-cupped egg poachers in the past, I was a little disappointed in the plastic cups due to the lengthened cooking time. It took several batches to get ""the perfect egg"" - which took approx. 7 minutes. Also, I do not remember the large amount of water on top of the eggs as normal for a typical egg poacher.That said, it does poach the eggs beautifully, the plastic cups are much easier to handle than metal cups, the eggs do not stick, and the design makes for very easy clean-up. I haven't noticed a smell being emitted from the plastic components. All in all, it's definitely worth the price."
2,Nonstick where's it's not needed,Everysurface of this product is coated with a non-stick surface except the cups that actually hold the eggs. These little plastic gems are a nuisance to clean. This was designed by an idiot it seems.
2,"SORRY, STILL FARBERWARE AT ITS WORST!","WELL, AFTER A SEVERAL TRIES I STILL CANNOT RECOMMEND PURCHASING THIS EGG POACHER. THE LAST GUSHING REVEIW FROM OUR NEW YORK FRIEND IS BAFFLING TO SEVERAL OF US HERE AND WE CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT SOMEONE IS TRYING TO KEEP THESE GOING OUT OF THE WAREHOUSE ANYWAY POSSIBLE. A PROFESSIONAL CHEF, A CHEMIST AND A DIETICIAN HAVE AGREED IN THIS HOME...THIS IS A POORLY DESIGNED PRODUCT FARBERWARE SHOULD HAVE TURNED ITS BACK ON AND SENT TO THRIFT STORES CLEARANCED AT 5 DOLLARS EACH. SORRY...WE ARE JUST BEING HONEST. WE CAN APPRECIATE SOME CLASSIC UTILITARIAN FARBERWARE PRODUCTS....BUT THIS IS JUNK.RENAISSANCE MAN"
2,Not recommended,"Like other reviewers here, I've had problems with a disconcerting plastic smell when using this thing, and (perhaps? I'm not sure) a faint plastic taste in the eggs themselves. I'll keep the pan, but I'll be looking for another egg poacher. How could something like this pass QA?"
4,Good read,Nice insight into the waning days of the Vietnam conflict. Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Have also enjoyed several other books by this author.
4,"Good quality, good protection","The case is well constructed and fits the GPSMap 60CSx very well. As noted by many other reviewers, the rear of the GPS unit is inaccessible with the case on, and threading the wrist strap through the tiny hole is awkward, but I feel that these are minor inconveniences for the level of protection gained. Oh, and unlike some of the others I can still operate the buttons through the plastic, albeit with less firmness of touch."
3,Plastic Clip,"I have two of these covers and the GPSMap 60 CSx's at work. The attaching clip on the back of the unit is plastic with a metal spring band inside. For a GPS used for field use and in and out of vehicles this can be problematic. I recently had one come apart when I was taking the pack it was attached to out of a vehicle after a biological survey and it caught on the lip of the trunk. The amount of force being applied was not very much when it occurred. The inside of the clip has a couple of hollow plastic pegs approximately three (3) mm in diameter that join the two halves. These snapped and the clip is useless. I am now hunting for a replacement clip. Therefore, the mounting clip on this may not be what you desire for rugged use."
2,OK but not for how I use it.,"This is a good case it you do not need to connect it to your computer or car all the time. There are not openings in the back for your external commections. I am constantly loading Geocaches into mine so everytime I have to take the case all the way off to connect it. I also have to take it off to plug it into my car, and at night this is helpfull do to the back light staying on when it is externaly powered. I would not recomend this if you use your external ports. However if you do not I realy like the look and feel of this case, just wish they would have left port holes."
2,Garmin case review,"Protective case does protect, but does not enable you to have it protected and in your car holder or atv holder at the same time. Also does not provide a hole for plugging in the separate car charger. The cover is durable but when buttons are pushed it tends to be much harder than it should be. If the velcro closure on the bottom is put too tight, then the rocker or enter buttons on the garmin get stuck down."
4,"Solid feel, pretty good product","The Garmin case does exactly what it's supposed to. One flaw is the plastic window can get scratched easily. It would appear that one needs to put a scratch protector over the protector.Also, due to the very tight fit, when using the rocker button it's very difficult to go ""left"" with the rocker. The plastic is sitting right on the rocker and I have to practically press the ""FIND"" button to go left.However, the fit is perfect, I can shove some paper between the unit and the cover, and it doesn't interfere with the clip-on feature."
2,Garmin Carrying Case,"The idea of having a case is great. The case is not practicle when it comes to hooking up to your computer, changing batteries or using 12V connection. You also have to remove the belt clip in order to remove the case.Could use a velcroed flip open door. Do not recommend purchasing this case until it can be remodeled."
3,Does its job,"The case fits snug, just like the one I had for my Legend. Working the buttons isn't too hard. The toggle on the 60csx doesn't always go where I want it even if the case is off!The only drawbacks seem to be that you can't mount the GPS in the car holder with the case on, access your input or power ports and feeding the lanyard through is a pain. If you don't need to replace the batteries frequently or download information into the GPS unit, the case does a great job of protecting it!I have gotten into the habit of not using the case unless I know I am heading into bushwacking country or will be climbing someplace it is likely to get scraped or dropped."
1,Pretty Much Unusable,"This unit is apparently not made for a Garmin GPSmap 60Cx. Half of the buttons are covered up when the GPS is put in it, and the GPS antenna is in the way of the flap to close the case. I also assumed that this case could be attached to my belt. I doubt that I will ever use this product without major modifications, and I would advise anyone to not purchase this product."
3,Protective case,"What can I say? It is just like any other case of this type. It does a great job of protecting the GPS unit from scratches and etc....However, it does make it more difficult to turn on and view the screen. I would rather use a screen protector and slip it into a camera type case to make the GPS unit easier to deploy and use."
5,Great case for the 60csx,"I bought this case for my Garmin 60csx with the primary intention of keeping it protected. It does that very well. Nice snug fit, feels really good in your hand. Of course, the 4-way rocker button in the center is going to feel a little different in use because you're moving it through a piece of clear plastic, but if that's the ""price"" I have to pay to protect my expensive unit, so be it. Build quality is absolutely first rate. I am very happy with this case and have no reservations in recommending it to any Garmin 60 owner."
4,It's not exactly what you might think it is...,"I needed to replace my eTrex Legend and bought the 60Cx and wanted a cover for it like I had on my eTrex. I purchased this cover and was quite surprised to see that although it covered the unit, there was no way to connect it to anything. My Garmin eTrex cover had come with it's own clips so that you could attach it to your backpack, etc. This cover is just that... a cover and nothing more. You must purchase, separately, a clip device if you actually wish to hang your GPS on your backpack or where ever.The cover itself seems nice and covers the unit well. Pushing the buttons through the plastic window is slightly cumbersome but that is expected. It's rather a pain to put the cover on/off though when you have the lanyard and the button clip attached to your GPS. But all in all, it covers and protects your GPS screen which is why you're buying the thing. But it should have a clip attachment on it or the fact that it doesn't should be made quite clear."
3,Too tight,Its seems to me to be to tight for the unit. It seems to press on the buttons. I would use it only when necesssary to keep the screen from being scratched. Geo.
4,GArmin GPS 60 Case,"Fits well. Nicely made. Easy to see and use all face buttons, but the on-off switch is difficult to find and push. Somewhat difficult to change batteries; the case has to be peeled up away from the battery cover - it fastens at the bottom. Must use the belt clip - there is no belt loop, etc. Vendor sent the case promptly."
3,How to connect unit with casing to PC?,"This is a good carrying case for the GPSMAP 60Cx. I think it just forgot to include an opening for connecting the unit to the PC (via USB). Hence, the GPS unit needs to be removed from the casing to establish connection. Troublesome but liveable."
3,not for wet enviroments,"This is a great product for a walking around dust cover. However, if it becomes wet it will fog up on the inside and render the gps unreadable. other than that it is a great protective case. still glad i bought it. I just do a lot of canoeing and it doesn't suit my purposes. The gps is waterproof, i wish the case was."
4,Does the job,"Well made case. Protects the GPS very well, as with any case makes it somewhat harder to push buttons, and see with shiny clear vinyl window. All in all a good case that fits well."
4,Cover for Garmin 60CSX,This thing fits like a glove! Very well constructed.Can't use if you use the Dash Board mount. You have to take it out of the case.
3,Good protection - but lacking functionality,"The case fits perfect on my GPS Map 60csx - you can see through the front nicely. However, the plastic is snug against buttons and makes it difficult to push them. Sometimes when you push one - it won't do what you wanted. It is a great case though for storing or carrying. But you'll most likely take it out of the case for heavy use or hiking, etc."
3,Does it's job,It's a decent case to throw on for a hike or general protection. No problems with pressing buttons. I don't like the fact that if you want to put the unit on any of the mounting brackets I have for the car and bike you have to take the cover off. Which is fine because you can't access any of the power ports anyway.
4,Very nice,"Protects the Garmin's 60 screen from scratches, but interferes with the button operations a little. Worth the hassle to protect the screen."
3,"Very good, could be better","Perfectly functional and looks good. It is black. It protects the body and screen while allowing access to all the relevant buttons and ports. It has a good grip, padding could be better, as GPS's are made for outdoors.The screen tends to collect dust and lint, but it is easy enough to wash off (after removing the 60cs)."
4,"Works great, with some minor flaws",Purchased this to protect my Garmin 60CSx and it works great. A snug fit and it is a nice second skin to an already rugged device.I do have to make notice to some minor flaws. It is a little difficult to get the cover off for USB and battery access. I have also noticed that the stitching around the lanyard and belt clip knob is beginning to come loose. These are the areas that always get caught up when you have to take off the case to access the USB or battery compartments.I went the extra step for protection and bought an Invisible Shield for the screen. In order to hook the GPS unit up to my bike I have to remove it from the Garmin case. I was wishing that Garmin would develop a carrier that would hold with the case still on the unit.For the price you can't beat it. Any stitching problems I'll fix up myself.
3,protective case Garmin 60cs,"A snug fitting case that offers protection fron scratches and nicks. You must remove it if you use the bike mount. Would prefer leather and snap instead of velcro closeure. The material is subject to tears , velcro sticks to everything."
4,Garmin Protective GPS Case Review,"When you spend $400 on a GPS, you need a field protection case. If you take your GPS out in the woods without a case, you are going to regret it. You are going to drop it. It will get dirty. This case offers scratch and bump protection. It is the cheapest insurance you can get for a GPS. The only disadvantage is that it does not provide access for GPS downloads. So I cut a little hole in the case to solve that problem."
2,Neoprene case for Garmin 60CSx,"Not worth buying. The stitching began to come out almost immediately, and after a week it was unraveling in two places. The case makes any non-trivial button use (especially with the rocker) a nuisance."
2,Not useful to me,Work great but I never used it. I'm able to keep the gps safe hiking without this cover. The cover just seemed to add extra bulk to an already heavy device. I ditched it before my first hike.
3,See through shield is too inflexible,"This case works OK in the warm weather, but forget it for winter use. When it is cold the see-through shield gets stiff and you can't press the key you intent to. It ends up clicking everything around where I press. I took it off for winter activities."
1,Doesn't fit the Garmin GPS 76CSX,"Bought it as I thought it would work well with the Garmin GPS 76CSX. Not happy. The item is sitting in my drawer, as it is a greater expense of time and money to return it."
3,Garmin 60CSx Case,"Nice case, looks good, but needs a flap in the back so you don't have to take it out for every function, such as change the batteries, hook up to the USB etc. Putting it in and out can be a pain between the wrist strap and the belt hook. Changing batteries in the field would be a pain with this case."
2,too expensive,Its just a fake leather and plastic cover. 20 bucks for this is way too much. And its not really comfortable to press the buttons. Youre better off without it.
3,Does its job,"It's a nice little case, especially for the money. Definitely protects your GPS 60 series. But there has to be something better out there. The screen is a little hard to see in certain light conditions but my biggest gripe would be how hard the buttons and directional pad can be to use. If you can find something better, buy that, but if I had to make the decision all over again I'd still buy this to keep my 60csx in beautiful shape."
3,Good but not as expected,"Quality and materials are excellent. It provides good protection to the GPS unit. The problem is when the protective case is holding the unit, it applies a little pressure over the keys, particularly on the ""central"" key, causing dificulties to use it. I don't know if the the 60C, 60Cx, 60CS and 60CSx have different sizes, but it seems the case doesn't fit perfect to a 60CSx unit. It is not compatible to use with the cigarette light adapter, external antenna nor USB cable. In general terms, good quality and good protection for your GPS unit but Garmin should work on it to correct this problem."
3,Could be better,It is a tight fitting cover that will prevent the unit from scratches and the accidental dropping. I wish that the cover could be modified so to fit into the handlebar holder for the 60CSx.
3,Garmin protective carrying case,"GARMIN 010-10578-00 Carrying CaseThis case, although displayed with the hand held Garmin 76 CSx gps does not fit the 76 series. A rubber protective case for the unit is available 3rd party that is supposed to fit. Garmin does not market a molded case for this instrument."
4,Garmin 60csx carrying case,Nice case but the clear part make it hard to push or navigate the bottoms.
5,Case for Garmin 60,"GARMIN 010-10578-00 Carrying CaseI have found that things being carried in the field occasionally get dropped, even as careful as one can be. This case fits the Garmin 60 series very well, better than an OJ glove, to help protect it from damage."
1,Great product terrible design,"This product is actually useful, but the serious design flaws render this productivity tool less useful then you would have believed, when you purchased it.The serious flaws are;- There is no holder for the pen, the one supplied is an external attachment and is totally useless. This means that if you forget, misplace or lose your pen, the Notepad will be rendered useless.- The USB port is totally a design flaw. The USB port socket is deep inside the slot in the front, and only the cable supplied by the product vendor fits in. No other standard USB cable can be used, I have tried atleast 10.So in short, a great product with a crappy design."
2,Don't belive the hype,"I purchased both books in this series and I am sooooo sorry I did. The characters are flat and if it wasn't for stereotypes they would have any development at all. This is paperback porn filled with ""oooo baby you're so strong"" etc. I couldn't bring myself to care for any of the characters good or bad and barely finished the book. The idea that the female villian was secretely pleased with the violent rough handling during sex and ""couldn't get enough"" was not only off-putting, it was sad. S&M has it's place I suppose but don't categorize it under ""Romance"". If you are looking for HOT,HARD sex scenes this series is for you (""Erotic"" is putting it mildly). If you are looking for romance, adventure and a riveting story - save your money."
1,Dreadful!,"I bought this book after reading the other positive reviews and wow- was this a huge disappointment. The storyline is boring, writing is mediocre, and generally found the interruptions in the plot to add gratuitous sex scenes that were not in the least bit moving nor pleasant, quite annoying. Didn't even finish the book. Lousy all the way around."
1,What a waste,"I got over halfway thru this book before I gave up on it. Instead of getting better it gets worse. I have to wonder why other authors gave this book such glowing reviews. The writing style is alright but the story is very weak. The world is coming to an end...friends and family are captured, tortured and killed. So what do our heros do? They have sex, a lot. There is nothing of substance here. If you want to read about magic read Jim Butcher or Kim Harrison. Save your money and your time."
1,Highly Overrated,"The reviews endorsing this book are criminal.The only reason I managed to finish this book was because I kept thinking surely at some point it would get better.This book consisted of:no humor - no expansion of characters (human, witch or magical Fae) - plot lines that go nowhere - story inconsistent - vulgar and redundant sex scenes - and an unsatisfying ending, the bad guy gets away and they don't find even her sister.The Author is obviously planning on making a sequel for the sister, Copper. ""horrors""In essence it was 440 pages of repetitive bad writing.I am shocked that this book was even published as is.With some rewrites and some good direction maybe this book might not have turned out to be a waste of good money."
1,Poor writing coupled with poorer erotica,"If you are like me, always on the look out for new paranormal erotica - pass on this dreadful book. The writing is flat and uninspired, old ideas saturated with vegan-wicca descriptions that left me shaking my head. The love scenes did not get my blood pumping and I found myself wishing someone [anyone!] would off the heroine, Silver, at the end of the book. The authour has obv. set up for a sequal that I for one hope is never published."
1,"Don't bother reading this book, rent a porno","I disliked this book. I bought it while waiting for the next L.K. Hamilton book to come out, but I had to force myself to finish reading it. There were huge holes in the plot, and there really wasn't a satisfying ending. The ""love"" scenes were crass and vulgar. I regretted buying the book, but I couldn't see wasting the money on it without reading the whole thing to see if it got any better. It did not."
1,Did I miss something?,"Another reader for ""Did I read the same book as everyone else?"" Flat, uninteresting characters. busy, uninteresting plot. Author more interested in teaching witchcraft 101 than a quality novel. Usually use these boring books to put myself to sleep...but couldn't finish this one."
1,Did I read the same book as the other reviewers?,"This book was basically sex scenes with a very loose storyline linking the sexual encounters together. The characters were poorly developed and not particularly likeable. It would have been a much better story if the characters were more personable. I can't say the sex scenes were all that riveting either. All in all, a very disappointing read."
2,This one took some effort,"There came a point I almost sat it down and left it. The sex scenes were written well enough and not too numerous, HOWEVER, I grow tired of heroines who repeatly do stupid things in the name of ""feminine independence"". Too many of the fight scenes seemed contrive and Dark Wolf's character was as thin as the paper he was written on. Hell, I liked the demon, Junga, better than most of the witches. Oh--and the battle with the Dark Side--Please! That got real old, real fast. I hope McCray's other works are better. You want good sex woven into decent plots, go for a little Keri Arthur."
1,Don't bother...,"Fortunately my local library had this book in, and I am so very glad that I didn't order it! The author starts out with a potentially good plot. However, the book soon boils down to brief and sometimes senseless action spacing out the ever-more vulgar sex scenes. If you enjoy L.K. Hamilton's newer books, then this may be right up your alley. For my money, Kelley Armstrong and Patricia Briggs have far more talent and imagination when it comes to supernatural romance stories."
2,I thought I'd like this,"I've read some of McCray's older Ellora's Cave books, and they were good. They weren't deep. They didn't take themselves so seriously or try to be anything more than what they were. They were squirm-in-your-seat erotic, written for women, and that was what was good about them. This book just didn't do it for me. It felt like McCray was trying too hard to write a serious book. It was dry. It was slow. Meh."
1,It's sad....,"I work in a book store and tell people not to buy this book. I warn them. It was the first romance I ever did let alone paranormal, which I am notseasoned in no thanks to Ms. McCray. I wanted to go to her signing cause she lives here in the area near me in Arizona. Glad I didn't cause I would have to tell her. Please stop. Crude probably...but as a future writer...and a seasoned reader, it's an example of what not to do...I also don't recommend Elloras cave. Yes erotic romance but crappy erotic romance. These writers are horrific at times. Some of us have read alot in these genres and these are books we do not reccomend at all. How they got publishe dis the age old question...guess some people don't care about the story, or the thought put into a good read just the momentary fulllfilment of sex every other page..."
5,A gifted storyteller!,"I have been waiting eagerly for this book to release and I was not disappointed! I've enjoyed other books by Cheyenne McCray but this one was my favorite. After reading her Wonderland series, I knew enough to expect a high level of sensuality. Ms. McCray is particularly talented at building spine-tingling sensual tension. But in addition to the red hot sex scenes, this book has a fabulous plot that kept me turning the pages to the end. Well done, Chey! I can't wait for the next book in the series to be released!"
5,very enjoyable,"very good book, introduces different mythology and alternate races well.i would recommend this book."
2,Don't waste your time or money on this one.,"I agree with other reviewers that this is nowhere near as good as the the other paranormal books it has been compared too. The charactors are one-dimensional and the paranormal stuff seems to have been added in because it sells well. There were lots of hot sex scenes, but they intruded rather than adding to the story - again, they seemed to have been added because that is what someone thinks will sell well. The book was too long, yet managed to leave all kinds of loose ends. I assume there will be sequals, but I don't really care about any of the charactors enough to want to read them."
1,barely adequate...,The willing suspension of disbelief eluded me completely with this book.This seems to be an exercise in something (but what?)and it's not working.
1,I was rooting for the bad guys!,"All the big authors who said great things about this book must of only read the sex parts because this book is really bad. I was rooting for the bad guys to have more sex. This book was like a bad porno movie. Fast forward over the dialogue and get to the good stuff. I only bought this used because I bought number two and realized I should read number one first. Big mistake. The villians are great. They plot and plan and have some banter. The male heros need to take the witches to their dimension, and stay here."
2,Great idea - Disappointing execution,"I was truly looking forward to this book. The cover (ala Kim Harrison) and the description, urban fantasy and romance within a framework of Irish mythology, were intriguing.What a disappointment. My daughters and I all read this book and the best description we could come up with is repetative. The plot only moves forward because the main characters have lapses of judgement and I tired of the constant references to the bulging musculature of the hero; I won't even get into the muffins and cookies. There are more adjectives available and more interesting things to describe. More plotting and less repetative description would have made this easier to read.I give this 2 stars only because I read most of it and it certainly sounded good."
2,Uggghhh,"I'm 150 pages in and I just can't read anymore. I just don't care what happens, which is very unlike me for reading. Usually like C McCray, but this is not one of her better books. Not recommended"
3,"Not particularly remarkable, with Celtic flair","The characters are shallow. The heroine is foolhardy in the interest of being a free and modern woman, which of course, forces her to rely on the man. There are far to many repetitive descriptions of the hero's perfect body and cookie craving. Additionally, the writer saw fit to try to through in some Celtic info and witchcraft in dilemma to try to capitalize on the popularity of books such as those written by Kelly Armstrong, Kim Harrison and Laurel K Hamilton. However, the only thing remarkable in the book is the kinky demon/warlock sex. If I read another of these books, it will be from the library. It is VERY clear that more books in the series can be expected and that is something I consider cheap."
5,Riveting,"This book literally took my breath away. I couldn't put this novel down not matter that dinner needed to be cooked, laundry done, and sleep. Did I mention sleep? I was up into the wee hours of the morning reading Forbidden Magic because I had to find out what happened with Silver and Hawk, and the extraordinary cast of characters. Finely crafted, well rounded characters, exciting battle scenes, erotic love scenes, and a plot that keeps you wanting more. A definite recommended read. I can't wait for the sequel, Seduced by Magic. Next year is too far away!"
2,"Flat, flat, flat","An unfortunately pedestrian and plodding little novel . Most events are summarized or told about :""I was sad."" ""I was shocked""...no real sense of character. Some effective evocations of the hajj and of daily life, but very diasappointing overall. Yes, it's told ""in the manner of 1001 Nights"",sort of, but why ? The story-telling mother is completely absent as a person."
3,5 Mile range? Hmmmm.....,"These are better than the FRS that are advertised with a 2 mile range. I live in suburbia, and tested these out. Range was from 1-2.5 miles within the city (and I'm being very generous)!"
4,NO NOAA!!,"In case you havent read the other reviews,these radios DO NOT have ANY NOAA channels. I just purchased these at a pawn shop for *cheap* and they work great. They are worth the price listed here. I do not have an FCC license (~yet~) but still use GMRS and wow can I tell the difference from the countless FRS radios I own. For starters, as with any new technology, there a significantly smaller number of users of GMRS as compared to FRS,thus making a drastically reduced crowdedness. I get great reception and love this product."
5,GREAT RADIO!!,Even though this radio does not have a pic is is really portabke and is the BEST GMRS Radio I have ever used!!although it does not have 10 NOAA CHANNELSI would reccomend this product to anyone!!it is real great!
5,I can't wait,"It's a gift for my niece, she used to love this as a girl I'm sure i can't wait to see her face once she gets it Xmas day"
5,Progressive Scan + HDTV is Outstanding,"I just replaced a 2+ year old Sony 550 DVD with the 700P. My DVD collection has never had it so good. My first spin was Pearl Harbor. WWOOOOOWWW If you've never seen 480P on a 61"" Sony HDTV....well, trust me, the picture is fantastic. The enclosed remote runs the DVD, my Sony 940 Receiver, and my HDTV..at least enough features that I can make all the needed selections. I didn't notice any improvement in sound for PCM, DTS or DD5.1 but I've always been happy with the sound qualities of my receiver.Downside?..I wish the face was black rather than silver as all of my components, except the DVD are black.One of the leading audio magazines reportedly claimed that the 700P coupled the a Sony HDTV was a dream combination....I would concur."
2,A Step Backward,"I had high hopes when I bought this unit to replace my four-year-old Sony S3000 DVD player. However, I was very disappointed with the 700P's interlaced picture (regular TV) compared to my older unit (I didn't have a HDTV to test the progressive scan feature). The colors from this unit were washed out and bled, and there was an overall lack of clarity and crispness to the picture. A weekend of tweaking the many picture adjustments made little difference. So I took back the unit and exchanged it for the new JVC XVS65GD: great interlaced picture, more features, more solidly built -- and $75 cheaper!"
1,Great while it lasted,"My Sony DVP-NS700P worked very well until last week when the sound quit working, (still has a great picture!). I have only owned two progressive scan DVD players, the other was a Toshiba and I liked this one best. I would have given it a 5 star rating two weeks ago!"
5,Impressive Functionality,"If you don't like this system it is because you do not know how to use its many functions or you bought a lemon! It is a very impressive buy if you know what you are doing or if you have an HD ready TV. It plays XVCDs, SVCDs, MP3s (long titles too), and Layer 0/1 DVDs. VCDs tend to be blocky and this DVD player helps by adding tools to clear up the picture. Colors are vivid if you use component video or even S-Video. DTS/Dolby digital (I use the optical out) sounds incredible. I have two such systems; one on a Philips 46"" HD TV and a Philips 27"" Flat Screen, both using component video and the picture on both is simply great. For the price you cannot get much better. You would have to spend much more than 200 bucks to do any better."
1,Extremely slow to respond to commands,"As far as the viewing quality is concerned this DVD player is acceptable compared to other equipment that is likewise seven years old. However, my biggest pet peeve is the sluggish response times, especially if you are trying to eject or open the DVD player. It usually needs to be told twice what to do. I am very dissapointed in Sony. This is a major flaw and very frustrating."
5,Interview Guide for Evaluating Dsm-IV Psychiatric Disorders and the Mental Status Examination,This is a great little book with the disorders in it. Easy to carry with you instead of the big book.
3,A quick handy guide,"I felt that this little pocket guide was really easy to read and helpful, especially when I needed to specify questions for certain interviewing sessions with clients. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a little extra help with difficult clients. Great for Students!"
2,checklists,"If you are looking for an effective way to ask sensitive questions, this book won't help you. The book is focused on going through checklists of DSM criteria. It does not differ much from checklists of symptoms that the patients can fill out on their own.I recommend the SCID (structured clinical interview for the DSM). The questions here are very effective for screening for symptom dimensions, and for further probing. For a more comprehensive psychiatric interview (not limited to symptom review), I found Harry Sullivan's book very helpful during and after training."
3,Unxpectedly small,"I think the book is great in content, and for $11 I jumped at buying it. The only disappointment I had was how small the book was. Its literally pocket-sized, and I didnt remember seeing that in the product descriptions, so if you have reading glasses, you will need them for this small book"
3,Cumbersome but useful,I found this little handbook to be a useful asset once I learned how to weed through the various questionaires an glean the parts applicable to each patient.
5,Helpful In Clinical Practice,Book can be helpful for sorting out why a clinican may have picked one disorder from another. Also can help with evidence based criterion for diagnosising.
4,A hands on refresher source,"This little paper back helps to focus in on and concretize those generic symptoms our clients report. It is a concise guide to help evaluate psychiatric disorders. This volume provides an overview and description of a clinical interview, a glossary, and a psychosocial interview outline."
3,Smallest book ever,"A good guide but a challenge to read. It is incredibly small with even smaller type. I expected a book of some reasonable size, not something I would get that looks like an instruction booklet."
1,this product does not fit the garmin 172 or 178 as advertised,this product does not fit the garmin 172 or 178 as advertised. The mount is not wide enough (by about 2 inches) and was made for another garmin product.I tried several times to correct the problem with amazon but they could never get it right (sent the same product to me twice). I finally gave up....thanks but no thanks!
4,Bigger than it seems,"I own a few Seiko watches, and this is my favorite already - I got it yesterday. First off, it is bigger than I thought it would be; for some reason I thought it was smaller, maybe based on the shape? It is a man's watch, very solid. The bold retro styling of the number font and the fact that the crystal has a magnifying effect gives the impression that the watch is older and more valuable than it is. And the picture is misleading; there is no pink tinge to the face - it is an very slight off-white. An exceptional watch for the price!"
5,love it,"I have had direct Tv for nearly 6 years and had various receivers. All have been reliable and did a good job, but this one. Have had Sharp, Sony, Phillips and RCA.THis one gives me very reliable service, super quality and superior dolby sound (this is receiver not Direct TV - Direct TV is just fabulous in quality and sound) but this receiver makes the most of what Direct TV gives.Love the menu set up, you zip through it, has a lot of neat features and preferences."
5,An excellent edition,"The Homeric Hymns are, in general, not easy to come by in bookstores. This Loeb edition is an very readable translations of the various hymns attributed to Homer. Since this is a Loeb edition, the Greek is on the left hand side and the English is on the right hand side. I keep this by my bedside for those times when I feel a need to read about the Gods and their exploits, and it a pleasure to read. The Greek also allows you, if you are feeling adventerous, to work on your own translating skills. My copy is well put together, as well as are my other Loebs, and the price can't be beaten.All-in-all, a very good and readable edition."
3,Ferry ! Ferry ! Ferry !!!,Ferry Corsten is my fav. DJ ever !!! but I have to be honest and say this disc left me wondering what the hell happened??? it is not like Ferry to drop such a dud of a cd. This disc has a very dated sound to it and the songs don't flow that well like a Ferry Mix usually does. I guess all DJ's are entitled to a day off and this must be Ferry's turn to have that day off.
2,not great at all,"well after purchasing Armin van Buuren's Boundaries of Imagination, i was impressed with this set of euphoric trance series and decided to buy Solar Serenades too...the first track is definitely something that will draw you in, but unfortunately, that's all the praise that i can give to this mix from Ferry Corsten. track selection was not that great, and the mix kept changing moods as it progressed instead of keeping a single mood throughout the album...what kinds of mood was i looking for? try Boundaries of Imagination, you'll see what i mean ;)overall it's a disappointment, 2 stars is even generous for this review."
5,Absolutely wonderful !,"I think it's absolutely wonderful. It has certain indoors/outdoors feeling depending on the orchestration of each song. The organ based tracks have a slightly cold daytime indoors feeling to them as if one was inside a church. Whereas the guitar, recorders cello based songs have a warm nature like nocturnal outdoors feeling. The latter in line with the enchanting illustration (Spirit of the Night). One can almost smell the perfumes from the flowers and leaves on a summer night. These tracks remind me of classical composers such as Villa-Lobos (Bachianas Brasileiras) and Rodriguo. Sparkled with Catherine Lamberts angelic voice, it's all down to a Midsummer Night's Scene. More, more ! Linda"
4,Bloody Weird,"Sounds like a Renaissance band playing T-Rex. I bought this record and it's definitely something you have to hear, just out of curiousity, but I'm not sure if I'll ever listen to it again.Okay, some time has passed, and I have listened to it again. In fact, I really like it. Her voice is beautiful and so is the music. It just takes some getting used to. When I listen to this, it's usually in the last hour or two before I go to sleep. It's great to wind down with."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...],"Stay Alive was decent, it was a unique story but still fairly predictable. It lacked a lot of the eye candy and cheesy jokes you expect in this type of film. I think the director was expecting people to take this seriously, but it's far from being the exorcist."
5,the greatest,"I really don't like to acclaim single recordings of a work being the best available. But I'm afraid this time that is the case. This Vegh recording of op 131 is the most beautiful and charismatic performance of this work you can possibly imagine. Their technical skills, perhaps, aren't perfect, but the way they play this music is something extraordinary. I know that there are Busch, Lindsay and Talich recordings of this work, but none of them achieves the same depth as the Vegh quartet does. Superb."
5,Wow!,"What a family! What a story! I loved this book. Every time I picked it up, I didn't know where I would end up. The images of growing up destitute in New York City as described by the 13 year old narrator were so poignantly written that you couldn't help but wonder where is she now? Early on I was lured into the filthy dysfunction this family manages to endure, yet found myself eagerly awaiting their next disappointment. Despite the rampant alcoholism, preoccupied mother and violence-prone brother, the love within this family endures. This book is beautifully written, bleak at times, but vibrantly alive! I can't wait for the sequel."
2,Here Sucks Come **SPOILERS**,"What trash. Hasn't this been done before Yannick? Come on! You're reading and you want the Hot dog man to step it up and you want the shotgun to go off at least once. Oh my God why does everyone just point it at each other?! I know this is largely autobio but jeez, boring! Mom should get over 'merde.' Sort of well writtenish but generally lame everything else. Pretentious. Don't waste your time."
1,Caution,"I ordered this griddle and on the third use the teflon coating burned off onto my glasstop stove. I called faberware directly since I was out of my return period, and after explaining my situation, they sent me another (different model) griddle, free of charge. The first product didnt work out, but the mfgr made good."
1,Not a good product,Very poor product. Does not heat evenly. Affects the taste of food and not in a good way. Think I'll give this one to charity and write it off my taxes.
4,Perfect for weekend breakfasts,"I purchased this in February 2007 along with the Nonstick 4-Piece Egg/Pancake Ring Set. Using them together, I can prepare weekend breakfasts of pancakes, french toast, eggs, bacon, sausages and potatoes O'Brien. There's plenty of room on this griddle to feed my family of four.The only complaint I have is that the griddle slides a little on my double burner. This works best on a perfectly flat surface. So, I use it on my gas grill, too."
4,Quality!,"We've used one of these, in the kitchen, for about three years... it's GREAT! It is thick enough that it does not twist and warp, and heats quite evenly. The only reason I did not give it a perfect store, is due to the fact that the handles heat up, and one needs to use mitts to move it.P.S.- I'm buying another, now, as the stove has two sides."
4,Excellent Griddle - I use it all the time,"I wish I had gotten one of these a long time ago. Easily makes 8 pancakes or 4 grilled cheeses. My wife can even use it without burning stuff - which she admits is a feat for her - so she uses it several times a week too. It holds heat well, cleans up easy, and the lip on the corner works great for draining. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the ceramic bottom scrapes pretty easily and it was fairly marked up after only 1 use on a regular coil burner stove - with gas you should be fine. It hasn't seemed to effect the performance though, and for the money it is quite perfect."
4,Double Griddle,"Great for the most part, but has a tendency of fishtailing because of its weight(shifts off a burner occasionally)Very easy to clean."
4,Just some dimensional information...,"One of the things that's important is the dimensions of these things to make sure they'll fit on your stove, so here goes:The actual griddle part is 18 inches by 10 inches with a tapered edge so the usable cooking area is 17.5 inches by 9.5 inches. The handles stick out 2 inches each, so the length of the griddle with the handles is 22 inches.Anyway, I gave it a 4 because I've used it about 10 times now and managed to get a small nick in the teflon--I'd prefer if it was a bit tougher. Other than that, it works great."
1,CAUTION!!! If you have a solid surface cooktop.,"When I ordered this griddle I did not see any warning about not using it on a solid surface cooktop. It was, however, clearly stated on the packing instructions. If I had known this before I would not have ordered it. Since we had it, we still gave it a try to see if maybe it was one of those warnings that was somehow exaggerated. Turns out it wasn't! The coating on the bottom of the griddle began to separate from the griddle and became attached to the cooktop. I don't think we did any permanent damage -- but we'll never use it on the cooktop again. We still need a double griddle for our cooktop. My wife did find a use for the griddle for baking in the oven. The handles on the end are ""handy""."
3,NOT SUITABLE FOR CERAMIC OR RADIANT TOPS!!!,"It is a beautifully well crafted griddle , but I can't use it! It is not suitable for ceramic or radiant stove tops! Please be aware of this BEFORE you order it (like I did) but hopefully you'll have read this review! Happy Cooking!"
1,Warning to Ceramic Top Stove owners,"If you own a ceramic top stove, do not order this product. It cannot be used on a ceramic top stove. This warning is only on the inside of the label covering the product."
4,Warning - Not for ceramic top stoves!,"I just received this griddle today and am SO disappointed to find on the small print on the box (and NOT in Amazon's description!) that this griddle can NOT be used on ceramic top stoves. It's a beautiful piece of cookware, heavyweight and with grease pour spouts at the edges. Exactly what I wanted, but very unfortunate that Amazon doesn't tell you that it won't work with some stoves. The warning on the box actually says that using this griddle on a ceramic stove can break the ceramic top. Probably would have given it 5 stars if I could have used it!"
4,Interesting Film. Great Acting By Ms. Duff. However...,"Note: I saw this movie on television.This made-for-tv movie starring Haylie Duff (Hilary Duff's sister) is well-made, with a great plot. And Ms. Duff is as good an actress, if not better, than her famous sister, who starred in the Disney Channel series and movie Lizzie McGuire. It also helps that Ms. Duff is easy on the eyes as well. However, I think the movie should have been 20-40 minutes longer, with more plot development regarding Claudia's relationships with her brother & the young boy she looked after along with who the police informant was. I recommend this movie.Rated TV-PG."
3,OK,"It does it's job and does not cost a fortune. The box is so light and the buttons require quite a hard push that it takes 2 hand to select speakers. The orange indicators that show which speakers are active have slipped. I guess it could have been built a little better, but for $30 or so, beggers can't be choosers."
3,It works...,"Pros:--Not bad for the price.--It works as advertised.--Nice pre-printed labels that you can use on the selector buttons (e.g., 'garage', 'patio', etc.)Cons:--It has those cheap little spring loaded connectors in the back. They are easy to use, but they don't hold very well when you're trying to run multiple sets of speaker wires in close proximity. If this is going to be installed some place where it gets bumped or moved often or the speaker wire gets pulled, this might not be the unit you want (i.e., the speaker wires are apt to come disconnected if disturbed.)."
4,selector switch,"works well especially for the price, four outputs are more than most needs, good value recommend for most applications with only two speakers"
1,does what I needed it to do,This item works great for what I needed. A friend wired it to different rooms and now I can hear my programs -- and actually get other chores done without being glued to the TV. Really make a big difference.
2,very cheap selector swithes,"i had this for around 3 months, 1 of the swithes is awful it never clicks into contact.now another one is getting bad.i am probably going to open it up and goto radioshack and have them help instal new swicthes.sadly i would not recommend this productthe seller i have no problems with."
4,Great Speaker Selector,Very good speaker selector. The four self labeled (they provided stickers with lots of room descriptor options) buttons on the front make using this unit self explanatory for people who walk up to it. It plays music and surround clearly.
3,Decent for the price,"To be honest, I did not purchase this product with high expectations. I simply needed an inexpensive way to supply music to various rooms in my house... The garage, basement, and kitchen.First the good: It's cheap and easy to use. The audio signal it sends to the speakers is decent and better than your average clock-radio. In fact, it is probably more than adequate for non-critical listening.The bad: The unit definitely degrades the audio signal. I currently have it connected to four different speakers brands and all of them reflect the same shortcoming, a loss of mid-to-upper range definition and a tendency to give the music a vague hollow sound. The better the speaker, the more this will be apparent.For less than $40 you really can't expect anything better. There is no way I would recommend this unit for a true audiophile. For someone simply wants an inexpensive way to add music to other parts of the house, it's a cheap way to go."
4,solid unit,"I purchased this unit in order to be able to add a set of outdoor speakers to the home stereo system. The unit works just as advertised, has a solid feel to it, but my outside speakers are much quieter than those in the house. This makes it just plain anoying. It's either too loud in the house or too quiet outside. Going to return it and buy one with independant volume controls."
4,SIMPLE AND FUNCTIONAL,"This speaker switcher works very well for what it is. Bear in mind that it operates mechanically, not electronically, so it requires no power, but has no fancy lights. It has enough inputs to run speakers to several areas. it also has a slim design that should go well with other stereo components."
4,Sima 4 Speaker Selector,"I needed this selector to change music locations in my house and it does the job I need. This product works well and was cheaper to buy on Amazon compared to any of our local stores. I actually only found two stores in my area that carry selectors and the price at Best Buy was a lot higher, Radio Shack was slightly higher but not in stock."
4,a good zone switch,"this is a nice switch. it is very simple to use. it is very simple to wire. the only thing i don't care for is the zone buttons. they work fine, but Sima could have used a soft touch button instead. the ones that are one it remind me of the ones used on electronics in the 80's, very stiff and loud."
5,Great Device for Multipler Pairs of Speakers,I have a Harman/Kardon receiver that does not support multiple speaker setups. I have speakers in my great room and wanted to set up some speakers outside near the patio. This speaker selector device was perfect for my needs. No power required for the unit. I was concerned about the impedence matching and wanted to make sure my H/K was protected. All seems to be working as advertised. I am able to play music out of multiple combinations of setups. Great product and would recommend to others.
2,Disappointing build quality,"The speaker selector box suffers from sloppy switch action and poor visual enunciation. At least on one of the selection positions (I am only using #1 & #2), only one speaker of the pair is predictably engaged unless the switch is repeatedly cycled on and off. If left on, within days, the switch becomes inactive on the same speaker and the cycling has to be repeated to get it to engage. This may be a unique issue with this particular switch of the four, but I suspect it is common because of how sloppy the switch action is across all four switches. Also, the on/off symbol is virtually unseen regardelss of switch position. Perhaps this quality of build is common at this price point."
1,Junk! Don't buy it.,JUNK! Don't buy it. Absolutely terrible. Button indicators fall out and don't even show up when the switch it activated. I called the company and they offered nothing. Don't buy this from them.
4,No better product for the price,"This is such a simple solution for adding speaker pairs I should have done it years ago.Pros:It doesn't affect sound quality (as far as I can tell).It's relatively small in size.It's incredibly easy to set-up and use (just plug in the speaker wire and you're done!).It comes with TONS of stickers for labeling your buttons, 3 pages i think!It's simple. There's not much here that can go wrong.Cons:Through a glass port you can see orange to indicate that those speakers have been selected. The port is small and difficult to see but the button is pressed in further than the non-selected speakers so you can tell easily that way.No volume control for the speakers. Common, it's less than $50 bucks, what do you expect?!Bottom Line:A great product at a great price that satisfies the desire to have a whole home stereo without paying an arm and a leg. It's simple, do-it-yourself, and worth every penny."
4,Speaker selector,"Works very vell. Easy to install, especially like location stickers for both front and back which adds to installation ease.fully meets expectations"
5,Great book for the celebrity hound,"I love this book! Great as a gift or just to feast your eyes on celebrities. Top Quality Book - and I know what's sexy! - Kristy Welsh, Author of ""Good Credit is Sexy"""
5,The Dyslexic Scholar : Helping Your Child Succeed in the Sch,it was very helpful in my needs for my son and another child whos parents are fighting with the school for their child.
3,OK film from the late '70s,"Killer's Delight, also known as The Sports Killer and The Dark Ride, is a serial killer film from 1978 that is not especially frightening, insightful, or suspenseful. The basic premise is that young women are turning up dead, evidently victims of the same killer. Sgt. Vince de Carlo (James Luisiand his psychologist girlfriend (Susan Sullivan) are on the case, but it's clear that their involvement also puts them at risk.There are some nice aspects to this film. It's generally well acted and does a fairly good job of capturing the look of the late '70s (always interesting for nostalgia). At about 80 minutes, it's lean and doesn't overstay its welcome. But in the end, there just isn't all that much to recommend about Killer's Delight. Apparently, this movie was loosely based on the real-lifeTed Bundymurders."
3,Not as good as her older stuff,"This album is OK as far as pop goes. I feel it lacks the heart and soul of her early work and didn't feel like she poured her everything into it. It's nice for background music, but I rarely listen to it for mood music."
4,Grateful Australian Fan,"It's been sometime since Tiffany release any material in Australia and it was only via the internet that I have become familiar with her lastest releases. I truly enjoyed this album. Though not as aggressive as ""The Color Of Silence"" it is obvious that Tiffany has matured as a singer and now competent songwriter but still in the guitar pop / rock vain."
1,What a bunch of bunk!,Just foolish stuff trying to be academic and thoughtful. There are much better books to read on this subject.
2,It Doesn't Reinvent Anything,"Osborne and Gaebler's ideas have been around a long time; don't be misled into thinking this is something new. Particularly objectionable is their use of phrases such as ""sluggish pace of bureaucracy"" which is designed to feed into the reader's own stereotype. The book feeds upon the fear of the reader, and therefore does not offer much in the way of scholarly reading. One would do better to read some Herbert Simon or Charles Goodsell before embarking on this journey."
3,Can government do better? An interesting conversation,"I recently revisited this book and it has some solid ideas on transforming the way government is run. So much of the debate today is on how to use government, conservatives to benefit those who have, and liberals to benefit those who do not have. Both want to spend money, so big and small is a useless paradigm. So we need to again talk about how to make the government we have responsive. No small chore. And this book will not solve placing political hacks into leadership positions and destroying career professionals and their work as we have seen over the last several years. None of this can be done if we do not have competent professionals in leadership positions with the courage to take on how our government delivers its services."
1,Worst book ever,"This book is the worst I have read in many years. The story line and settings were good, but Sey, the main character was determined to make one bad decision after another. On another note, what is with the atttaction to men of color. You can really tell the book was written by a woman, must have some French blood in her."
4,flute & ensemble,"The flute sounds are lush sans any ""whistle sound"". The tempo varies beautifully without the use of percussion ( as far as I could tell).The xylophone is an unexpected pleasure."
1,Don't buy this machine,A total disappointment! I second the Sept. 22 review with how poorly this machine works and how terribly annoying and frustrating the system works (or does not work).Don't buy. A more expensive single dvd player is the better way to go.
2,Great bracelet but good luck telling time,"I like the oversized wrist band but it is almost impossible to read the display. The light is very dim, and good luck learning how to change the time. It looks cool but I still have to use my cell phone as a watch when I am out."
2,Nice watch - but hard to read in daylight,"Well, the watch looked good in the ad and the pics on the net, however, when the watch arrived the first thing I noticed (or not noticed) was how difficult it was to read the time. The light setting on this watch really needs to be brighter for sure. I'm not sure if Diesel are trying to increase the longevity of the battery...or whether the lack of brightness is supposed to be part of the 'look' of this watch, but it just doesn't work.Apart from the dimly lit numbers, the band feels a bit funny. I much prefer my Altivo limited edition concealed watch bands. These feel solid and don't slip. This one slips.Overall, I'd rate it 2 stars."
1,Not a great idea,"I am sending this product back. It looks nice and the design is different, but the negative aspects simply are too much at this point. First, the book they sent with the watch does not contain instructions for this particular model. Therefore, you spend hours trying to figure out how to set the time, which is not easy. There is a big problem with actually seeing anything on the screen, you basically have to push the light button to make sense of the numbers, if you don't, it looks so pale that it is very hard to see. The watch is kind of heavy, it is not one of these light, modern designs, looks like some objects from the 60's. It is not worth the price."
3,Good artwork and bizzare storyline,"This is a good series and its weak point is ending (and maybe Taste of Revenge trade). It is a bit repetitive: mix James Bond/Sherlock Holmes kind of Ruse, John Woo hardcore crime movie and weird love story and you got your Freeman novel.PROArt, unseen and suprising ruse mafia uses, art...CONTRAWeird sex, too much bizzare violence, everything depicted quite explicitely and unnecessarily. If it was color comic, pages would be red usually."
5,excellent quality!,"I've finally learned, it's worth the extra money to invest in really good bakeware. This is a great pan! My tarts browned perfectly and slid right out without sticking."
4,Beautiful Presentations,I like the pan. Tartlettes slide out nicely and are evenly shaped. My only complaint is that the volume is less than I'd like but that isn't the fault of the pan!
5,Excellant pan,"I just received this pan yesterday and used it this morning at my espresso bar/bakery to make the fruit tart recipe that came with the pan (even though my plan was to use it for mini quiches). The recipe was fantastic, the tartletts turned out amazingly and they sold out within a very short period of time. I'm ordering another pan right now so that I can make a larger quantity of tartletts at a time. Highly recommend!!!"
4,"Good, heavy pan.",This is a good pan for mini tarts. The construction is heavy duty and non-stick. I think the only think I'd like to see is a more pronounces design in the sides of the tarts once made.
2,Rather elementary,This is a great book as an introduction to what postmodernism is but lacks anything more indepth
3,Brilliantly Funny,"Jean Reno excels at black comedy, ""Wasabi"" comes to mind. This film is over the top, a farce, with unexpected laughs around every corner. However, the film-to-DVD transfer is terrible: faded color and the subtitles are 50% illegible (yellow). When the background is light, it is impossible to read them. I wish someone would re-do the transfer, the film deserves better!"
5,The Most Beautiful Villages of Brittany,"This book is one in a series of ""The Most Beautiful Villages of..."". Although they all have different authors the photography is exceptional. The book concentrates on four areas and the villages that make up each area. There is a short history of each region as well as interesting information on the villages and captions on the photos. In my opinion it is the photographs that give this book five stars. It is a wonderful ""coffee table"" book to own."
2,I thought this book was going to be about women's wrestling!,"Despite the scatalogical references in the title this was a Christian book in the end. Mrs. Johnson is not afraid to make herself the butt of the joke, and most of her stories were a gas. Though not fine literature, this book definitely deserves a number two. I'm grateful she felt that sharing these stories was her Christian duty.But when, oh when, will she write about her experiences as a female wrestler? Barb, don't be shy!"
3,FANCY WITH NO CLEANING OPTION,This Classic Moderne 2-1/2-Quart Whistling Stainless Steel Teakettle has shiny classic shape but you want to make a tea youhave to pour or fill through the spout's cap which is realy disadvantage of this TeaKettle.Also there is no option to clean inside incase if you burn it!!
3,Batman Begins gauntlets for Halloween,"The opening was too large at the back, so I had to add velcro closures. Also the fins are the same material as the gloves, which I didn't realize. It makes them ""floppy"". I thought they were plastic. Additionally, the fingertips started to have pieces of the material flake off after just one evening of normal use.After the adjustments they looked alright, but functionally they're kind-of a bust. Thanks for reading."
4,Great for artists of all types!,This documentary was a well balanced and thoughful telling of the state of the art in our digital age. I recommend it to artists of all types.
2,"Interesting topic, poor storytelling","This film looks gorgeous, but I wish as much attention had been spent on the editing/crafting of the arc of the movie. It's a grab bag of interviews and commentary that hasn't been shaped into a clear story. Hard to recommend."
3,Great but no zipper for cleaing the cover.,"My dogs really like this bed. I bought two of them. They are thick and well-padded. My only gripe is that there are no zippers so one can take the covers off to wash them. Since most large dog beds do have removable covers, even the ones with separate roll areas in them, I find this to be a major drawback."
4,My Dane Approves,"My 132 pound Great Dane curls herself up nicely in the 52"" bagel bed. She seems to think its nice, but of course prefers the couch. The cover is NOT removable. So I'm not sure how I will go about cleaning this. Big dog = big dog smells. :/ we shall see, but I do wish that this would have been considered."
3,1950's crime,"If you like the style of the paperback crime stories of half a century ago, you'll love this mindless tale that can be read in one sitting. Probably was 25-cents in paperback when it was published."
4,"Good SG-1 reference, Good guide for someone with time to up convert","As far as information and browsing go this book is great. Its very pretty and complete.As for the rules of this RPG, well its an early edition d20 system book. It would be great if someone spent the time up-converting the book to newer rules of a more developed game like Pathfinder. Then again, most roll playing stuff is free online now under the OGL. My advice it to ignore the core rules and go with a more modern core rule setup and use the elements that are unique to this book to supplement."
5,contains everything needed in a budo reference book,secretes of aikido contained the photographs the would make o'sensei very proud.It had the tradition and the information that will help the beginner to the advanced student I enjoyed the book immencly Ed Gonzales
3,Pleasant surprise!,"You could do a lot worse than to pass a rainy afternoon viewing this delightful teen comedy. Director Bruce Leddy makes an impressive directorial debut, extracting good performances from his ensemble cast (this is the best work Tia Carrere has ever done!), and staging some impressively blocked scenes. Look for the big ""revelation"" scene between Jason London, Chris McDonald and Tia Carrere. Very nice indeed. Special marks also go to the film's cinematography. At times it recalls the work of Gordon Willis on Woody Allen's color films. Also look out for newcomer Zak Orth as London's sidekick. Why is this kid not a star? Overall, fun flick, good looking DVD transfer (also includes Theatrical trailer and cast notes), and nice soundtrack. Worth a look. A very pleasant surprise."
4,FUN MOVIE,"I liked this movie because it is a fun movie to watch. Plus I am a fan of Jason London, ever since I saw A Man in the Moon, years ago."
2,Below average sexy comedy,"First of all, there is one nude scene with Tia Carrere showing her tops (but I think it is a body double) as the scene didn't show Ms. Carrere's face. Other than that there is not much to see from this teen oriented sexy comedy. The plot about a high school student who falls for her sexy math tutor who happens to be the wife of his math professor. Besides Tia Carrere, there is nothing else this movie can offer."
5,Great product,"Worth every penny, works great, stayed dry nomatter how deep I dived, mouth price was comfortable and purge valve easily clears any water that may get in works as good or better than snorkels that cost five times as much"
3,"Stayed fairly dry, but somewhat restricted airflow","Bought this snorkel on a whim, while also getting a prescription lens mask. I liked the mouthpiece, flex-tube, and the fact that it had a whistle. It didn't stay totally dry though, but it purges pretty easily My main complaint is that the top hole is smaller in diameter than a regular snorkel. I felt breathing through it restricted my airflow volume just a bit. I switched back to my usual non-dry snorkel after a couple of uses."
5,a tradition,"my second year using this calendar with my mother, I understand that there is no end to knowledge and that with knowledge comes the risk of being egotistic but this is still fun."
5,amazing series,i had to hunt this volume down but i was so glad i found it. it was worth every penny (which btw was cheaper than buying it in a store). its one of my favorite series to date and ive read it at least 5 times. if your thinking about one tei' then buy it now! if you need a new manga then buy it now!
5,Great Book,I bought both of them together arfter skimming thru them. I loved the story. Too bad its only 2 volumes long. I highly recommend this Book.
2,a disappointing ending,"I wasn't satisfied with the way this series wound up. First they had to postulate an alien race _and_ an unknown disease just to set up a situation that would throw the lead characters together.Having set up a relationship, they basically ended with series without resolving it, and used the mythical disease as a metaphor for something else.Lots of series need a ""hook"" to bring the main characters together; but I want a story to move on from there. This seemed stuck in the early stages until it abruptly ended."
4,enjoyable,i really like this movie though the first one i ordered didn't play on my TV but when i ordered the other one it did i wanted too see this movie for a long time and have to say it is a really good movie
4,You really want to know what will happen next,"This is a really good movie. Yes, unpleasant subject, but it's a reality and it's done well. Love the Katie character's increasing discomfort as her loyalties between her lover (and his family) and the FBI get harder and harder to keep ""black and white.""Tom Berenger is a VERY sexy man and no less so here. He even remains somewhat likable while doing dreadful things and often acts like an ass...a sign of acting well done. He's no Marlon Brando, but he's good. I wish the sex scene had been...sexier.The scene where he finds out she is with the FBI...the look on his face...how sad he clearly is...YIKES. Good stuff. This isn't perfect but it's totally worth a watch. There's lots of betrayals here, on many levels."
1,Terrible: It did not pay,"Terrible! Terrible!! The DVD would not play. I'm not sure it was made for United State. I'm planning to return it. I have had great experiences at Amazon; however, this was a terrible experience. If it is possible to black list this seller, Amazon should do so. Thank you"
1,Bizarre and unrealistic,"When I saw that Esterhaz wrote this film, I knew it would be crap. He's the guy who gave us Stripper. The man has the intellect of a pimp."
2,Are You People Kidding?,This is not a 5 star film. And I have to agree with Acute Observer in finding this not realistic or believable in many aspects. As flawed as our government is I highly doubt that the FBI would allow a club that hunts young black men to continue on while they look for more evidence. And I found it impossible to believe that Debra Winger's character could continue to love Berenger after discovering that he was a racist murderer. This film is a guilty pleasure- albeit a wierd one. It plays more like a tv movie than a brilliant feature film. It is extremely dated and is written for a junior high or high school level of intellect.
4,masterboy sound,"if you like masterboy and eurodance music, this cd is for you. although it's not good as masterboy previous release, it's still has masterboy sound in it."
2,too hot to handle,"I have gone through 5 of these external drives (work purchase)...each time after a significant back-up, drive overheats and hard drive fails. If given the option of purchasing this or backing your data up with dvds...go the dvd route....or spend the extra $$$ fora better external storage device"
1,Doesn't work! Insde sticker says it was built in 2005!,Misrepresented item as new (2005) and item does not work. If they will refund my purchase and shipping I will change me review
5,Great book!,Different from the American version of the film but still a really good storyline. Pretty spooky at some parts too!
4,Different enough to be interesting,"Having thoroughly enjoyed all three Ringu movies I couldn't help but be curious about the book they were based on, so when The Ring by Koji Suzuki became available I bought a copy and read it straight through the same night. As this implies, it's a good read. The book is different enough from the movies to be interesting (e.g. Asakawa is a man), there are several surprises and some points are explained in more detail than in the films, so it was definitely worthwhile. Can't really tell how closely the translation captures the spirit of the original, but it reads as if it had been composed in English, so the translation is, at least, effective."
1,This is Japanese prose?,"Ouch. What could have been an intriguing story gets sunk by dreadful writing. I've read a fair amount of translated Japanese fiction and all of it is head and shoulders above this. The style is graceless and leaden, and a lot of the story is flatout illogical as a result. Whether the fault lies in the original or in the translation is something I'll leave to Japanese language readers to decide. Suffice it to say this is barely readable."
2,Easy read,"It is entertaining, but lacks a certain intelectual quality that one looks for in a novel. Drags on a bit, but an easy read."
3,Send the translators on a writing course,"I wouldn't dispute that it's a great story, and the translation may well be accurate, but only a very bad writer would ever use phrases like ""Never in his wildest dreams would he imagine what awaited him there"" and its ilk, unless writing for a pre-teen audience. I suspect that the translators majored in Japanese rather than English Literature. Mind you, that's fairly impressive in itself.Despite that, still a good story."
5,A very nice story...,"This is a sharply, almost scientifically written horror story. The author manages to offer a modern view of Japan society as it tries to put together a very objective and technological life style, along with very subjective issues as ethics, culture,traditional family links, etc. One of the principal characters is a researcher who does science this way; combining an older philosophical and spiritual approach with modern knowledge of biology, physics, and others. All in all, my particular opinion is that this is an excellent book telling a very smart and entertaining horror story. The book is better and deeper than the japanese movie which in turn is superior to the american version."
4,"Excellent Book, Eerie Premise","I've seen ""Ringu"", ""The Ring"" and ""The Ring 2"" and I chanced upon this book in a local bookstore. As enough has been said of the book's plot, I'll summarise my thoughts like this:* The type of story is very different to what I'm culturally used to as 'horror' or even 'detective'* I found it interesting that I didn't like either of the two protagonaists i n d i v i d u a l l y however I sympathised with their 'mateship' [I'm Australian]* I never understood why a pre-teen girl would come back to get people even if she had been shoved in a well by her parents - the book's explanation for this course of events makes much, much more senseAlthough the translation did seem a little simple in places, I found it added to the atmosphere of the story. Its simplicity allowed me to read quickly to find out who the book's author's Sadako really was.In the end, I don't think any of the characters really had a 'good' ending..."
5,"If you liked the movie, you'll absolutely love the book","Koji Suzuki is the Stephen King of Japan! His writing is amazing! I saw the movies; both Ring and Ringu, and had to read the book. It's a little pricy, but the paperback is coming out! I thought it was so good, I have to read the sequal, Spiral also coming out in April! I think it's a great book for adults as well as pre- teens and teens!"
1,What was I thinking?,"There is one song that is half decent on the whole album. I don't take drugs (well, caffeine), but I must have been on something when I ordered this. It just isn't my music."
4,informative,"This book is organized in an easy to understand fashion and the different medications are explained in depth. I love how the medications usage and other detailed information is clear, however there are some medications that my son has been prescribed lately that are not in this book. This is probably because my son has other diagnosis' in addition to Asperger's- but since the Dr/Author mentions how common this is in the book I would think that maybe some of the medications for the common co-morbid issues would be included in the book. This is a good book- I guess I just want more :)"
4,"Not the best, still really good","First off, I want to say that In-Sides, Snivilstation, and basically all of what I've heard of their earlier work is better.But, aside from that, this is still a really cool album. One thing about it is that it's not intelligent like their previous works. The whole cd is just not as interesting to listen to, and as a result I avoid thinking about the music itself. Instead, this cd is much better appreciated as ""Background"" or ""mood"" music. It's sort of like sophisticated trance, in that it's very rythmic and such, but also not totally lacking in substance.All in all, the album is enjoyable. At first I didn't listen to it much, but I'm still listening to it, so it's high on my list."
5,Astounding,"I've been an Orbital fan a long time before this album was released, so I can honestly say this is the best Orbital release to date.If you don't like at least one track on this album, there is probably something wrong with your brain."
2,What happened to Orbital? :(,"In Sides.. it was one of my favourite albums for a loooong time. It had style, and very good music on it. But MoN.. Hmm.. I only like Nothing Left 1/2.. All other tracks don't sound like Orbital I knew. Junk music.. Very-very sad.."
4,Similar to their first two albums,"Some albums grab you the very first time you listen to them, others take some getting used to. Middle of Nowhere is of the latter type. The first couple times listening to this recording it seemed kind of dry and lacking compaired to their earlier albums, but after some time, it started to grow on me. I still prefer the ""green"" and ""brown"" albums (Orbital and Orbital+ respectivly) but this one is definly worth getting if you already have those. (and is more similar in style to those two then Snvilisation or In Sides.) Worth noting on this album is the brilliant ""Style"", one of Orbitals very best songs in my opinion. In short... good album, but don't let it be your interduction to Orbital."
4,Very Well Done,"This CD is great. The rhythms are very catchy, and voice samples compliment the tracks. The pace in this album changes a lot and gets pretty interesting at times. However, I can't give this recording 5 stars. The transitions aren't as smooth as they could have been, and the album didn't capture my attention as much as I would have liked. It's still a very good piece of work, and you might like it more than I did. All in all, I'd give this one a shot. You'll probably be glad you did."
3,Dissapointing,"Don't get me wrong-this is not a bad CD. It just dosen't compete with the duo's last outing ""In Sides"". Besides from the great intro track ""Way Out,"" (which seems like the partner to the epic ""Is anybody out there?"" final track on In Sides,) the rest of the CD seems like a collection of mismatched B-sides. With this outing, Orbital take an attempt at real lighthearted dance music, but this is not their forte. They are much better at emotional, atmospheric, and symphonic tracks than the dance type. On a metaphorical level, ""In Sides"" can be seen as a Journey, whereas ""Middle of Nowhere"" is an Arrival. The Journey is full of wondrous sights and sounds that touch the emotions. The Arrival is a giddy and odd party that quickly wears thin, and it is human nature to be looking forward for the next journey. All in all, this album is only for the die-hard Orbital fans; to the rest of us it will seem like this truly is in ""The Middle of Nowhere."""
3,disappointment,"i've been an orbital fan for many years but i can't recommend this unless you *really* like orbital. with the exception of trac 6 and a scant few others, this effort is a disappointment. a few tracs are even irritating. ""beaucoup fish"" or ""surrender"" would be wiser choices."
5,Light and very enjoyable,"This CD is a bit lighter than IN SIDES, which is one of my favorite Orbital CDs, along with Diversions -- the Peel Sessions are probably my favorite of all -- but this is really quite nice. I think the first four tracks are the strongest, but the whole CD is nice to just put on, sit back, and relax. Very, very enjoyable!"
4,Excellent for an electronica fan,"This is a long awaited album for many fans of Electronica. The most enjoyable thing about it is that it stays away from the sub categories of techno. It is not ""Dance"" nor ""drum and Bass"" nor ""Trip Hop"". It's just good."
4,hmmmmm......can be better,good but ne e tolko good:)) the brothers were taking high during the recordings:))
4,Very interesting to listen to...,"This CD, in my opinion, is a bit of a departure from ""In Sides"". ""The Middle of Nowhere"" is looser, groovier, and a bit more ""orchestral"" whereas ""In Sides"" was more of the type of CD where you just had to sit and listen. ""Nowhere"" kinda wants you to make you get up and dance! The best tracks on this particular CD are ""Way Out"", ""Spare Parts Express"", and ""Nothing Left (1 & 2)"". This CD (like all their other ones) does take some time to digest. But in the end, it's definitely worth it!"
5,Pleasantly Surprised.,"Coming from a new age techno background, this has got me interested in more of what Orbital can do... Clever and not too commercial. Nice and evolving without 'easy' beats. Try this if your new to techno and are hoping for sophisticated techno."
2,the beginning of the end?,"orbital is the best band of the decade. they've remained in heavy rotation at my house since i first purchased ""chime"" in '92.that said, ""the middle of nowhere"" makes absolutely no sense. have the brothers hartnoll lost their spark? have they given up drugs? or, like all good things, have they simply come to an end?"
5,Fantastic CD,"Orbital has created a musical journey that you will listen to time and again. Other reviews on here for this CD are quite detailed, so I'll get to the point. If you are a fan of Orbital, you probably already own this CD (buy it if you don't). If you've never heard of Orbital, but enjoy rich electronic music, I would suggest you try to hear at least this CD and ""The Box"" (also by Orbital)."
4,"I wasn't crazy about it at first, but then it spoke to me","I'd put Middle of Nowhere in my car CD player and although at first I found it unmoving, I felt a silent urging to keep listening. Over time I liked it more and more. Then one afternoon on the way home, I was listening to Otono and realized the instruments were SPEAKING TO ME.No, I wasn't doing crack or anything stronger than music for that matter. But music is a form of language. What I heard that afternoon was the language of this album. The ""words"" were foreign to me but an underlying emotion and meaning was connecting to me through a mechanism deeper than verbalization, deeper than the surface of overt meaning. I still don't find this the grooviest of all Orbital albums, and certainly not the most approachable, but I think it is a harbinger of something great to come. Meanwhile, if you do what I did and listen with an open mind, you may hear the language of those weird sounds too."
3,:s,"I really have mixed feelings about this release. Having discovered Orbital in 92, I've purchased every album, every single, every vinyl release, and I've never traded in anything of theirs until now.It's almost a pantomime of In Sides. It's almost a good album, too (and I love the idea of sampling all the BBC radiophonic stuff). But after 3 listens (in headphones), I just didn't find anything worth holding on to.I regret having missed them live this time around, but I don't regret the day I sold this CD back to the store.My Advice:Borrow a copy from a friend and wait for their next release, but save your money for something else this year."
3,Surrender instead,"I bought this Cd thinking it would be good because I have seen Orbital, on numerous occasion being compared with The Chemical Borhters, but I have to say I was disappointed somewhat. The Chemical Brothers new CD ""surrender"" is an awesome CD that is lot better than ""The Middle of Nowhere"". This cd's sounds are weaker. This cd lacks fast beats and more importantly variety. It seems like some tracks start weak, and need a lot of time and very slowly builds up to a point where they start sounding good. ""Know where to Run"" is my favorite in my opinion has to be the best track on this CD."
