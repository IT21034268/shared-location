4,different but good,"Great nostalgia, Spooky Tooth has assembled a good band and plays many classics from that era. Small venue, big sound and well produced makes this an excellent choice."
4,How'd I Miss This One,"Wow, I'm a die-hard Who fan and can't believe I never wore this one out growing up. The songs are great; early Who with glimpses of what's to come with Odds and Sods and Tommy. They intersperse some ads from radio that were playing back then - very fun touch. If you love the Who, this should be in your collection."
4,Very Interesting,"I have had this album for a week and am simply amazed. I have never heard anything like it before. I probably never will again. Not an all-out classic like Tommy or Who's Next, but worth looking into."
5,A WONDERFUL RELEASE!!,"This Japanese mini-lp replica version of Who, Sell Out, is simply a work of art! Very beautifully designed with all the lyrics included and with a sound quality remastered 24-BIT to perfection. Wonderful Japanese OBI strip, really a work of art!This is by far the best version of this album that is out there; great sound quality, great packaging! A must have in any CD collector's library."
4,Here's a surprise,"This was certainly a unique idea at the time. Put fake commercials between the songs and have it be like a radio broadcast. It is mostly successful, but not completely. It includes my personal favorite Who number, ""I Can See For Miles"", which was also the group's only Top Ten hit in the U.S. The thing that dissapointed me most about this CD is the bonus tracks. For the most part, they aren't as good as the songs that were included on the original album. Of course, that's probably why they were left off of the album in the first place."
2,Less Is Best,"This album epitomized 'thinking person's rock' in 1967, and I had hoped that an expanded version would make it even more rewarding 40 years on. Sadly, the commercial breaks are shortened, and the added songs are not up to the quality of original selection. I have to say that it was a disappointment, and I'm glad I still have a CD of the original to refer to."
2,"Great album, lousy remix","When I sold my vinyl version of this album, I never imagined I would be unable to buy an exact replica on CD or MP3. But that's the way it is. While the entire Beatles backlist has been reissued, lovingly restored in the original mono, The Who Sell Out is a travesty, missing some material that was on the original, while being afflicted with lame ""stereo"" effects (which cannot be easily removed) such as phasing the vocals between channels."
3,Only Fair,"This album is not iconic, and probably did not deserve a deluxe edition. Other then the uniqueness of the advertisements in between some of the songs, and the brilliant cover art, an album becomes essential largely when a band believes in the album, and performs the songs from said album. Once released, few if any of the songs on this disc ended up being performed live, and if so were soon dropped from the lineup, never to be performed again (this is unbelievable in light of ""I Can See For Miles"" being the greatest Who song ever for my money). Another great one is ""Armenia City In The Sky"". There were also a few other awesome tracks: ""Mary Anne With The Shaky Hand"", ""I Can't Reach You"", and ""Our Love Was"", many of which were sung by Pete Townshend, instead of Roger Daltrey (not necessarily a band effort). The Who's set list became stale long ago, and unfortunately, other then ""Relax"" and ""Tatoo"", never included much of this album, which is criminal."
5,A glimpse into the past,"To say that this is a great album is an understatement. What it is an example of is this: Back in the 60's when you bought an LP you really didn't know what you'd get, what new sounds you'd hear, what odd little things might happen on the way through the grooves. It was a fun experience and one that, sadly, generations since have missed. Like ""Sgt Pepper,"" ""Are you Experienced"" and ""Pet Sounds"" there was an exploratory adventure going on between the artist(s) and the listener. That's just one of the things that made the 60's so very unique. the Who's creativity wasn't so concerned with commercial success as it was with being unfettered and bold and those qualities shine on this incredible album."
3,Sell Out Vinyl,"I do not remember buying this. Must have been my son so you can not go by rating of It's Okay, sorry."
5,The Who Primer - All the seeds of what was to come,"In 1967 a small band of awkward teens knew that The Who Sell Out defined a point of no return, and was more important than anything at home or in school. This is the real Who primer. It contains the grade-school version of every Pete Townshend masterpiece to come. ""Tattoo"" is every great Who melody in a single-song three minute opera. ""Rael"" includes the great Sparks/Underture theme from Tommy. ""I Can't Reach You"" is pretty much Townshend's entire solo career in a blender. ""I Can See For Miles"" is Pete's hit single that never hit. It's so good that The Who have rarely tried to pull it off live. And for the guitar hero crowd there's the twin peaks of the all-time greatest 1-note guitar solo (I Can See For Miles) and the elegant solo acoustic guitar of ""Sunrise"". If you can just buy one Who album....That's impossible! Start here. Then do what you have to do to get the rest."
5,buy it now,"What's amazing about this album is that there's a lot of diversity combined among the VERY melodic and entertaining songwriting. This is probably one of the Who's best albums, though it's always been a tough choice between this or Tommy. I say own BOTH albums. You have the concept theme of Tommy, but the diverse songwriting talents of Who Sell Out. Seriously, each song on the album sounds much different from the other ones, so that makes Who Sell Out a classic in my book."
4,This is the Who I love,"To me this is the Who at the height of their powers and my second favorite album by them, falling only behind the ""Meaty, Beaty Big and Bouncy"" compilation. There's not much to say about the music that hasn't been said before. Everything's ferocious, the lyrics are wonderful and even the ""commercials"" are fun. What's more this re-issue also comes with a bounty of interesting bonus tracks. It would have been nicer if the bonus material was put on a second disc to preserve the album in it's original form, but that's splitting hairs. Highly recommended."
5,The Who Sell Out-Deluxe Edition,"The Who Sell out was the band's first ""concept album"" and, it can be argued, was their best concept album until their magnum opus ""Quadrophenia"". The way the band made the album sound like a ""pirate radio"" station of the mid-1960's was brilliant and the songs are great. If this album had been the hit that ""Tommy"" was, I believe the band's fortunes would have changed their sound and made them more experimental instead of dragging ""Tommy"" around for years."
5,greatest who album,"the who ripped out all the pop standards with this milestone record. this was the first real concept album. the who blended various pop music ideas along with imaginative commericials to give the listener a reflection of top-40 radio of the time. the hits like ""i can see for miles"" are there as well as some cleverly crafted jabs at pop radio advertizers. the record is as exciting and relevant today as the day it was released."
4,Summer of love stuff,"Ah 1967! Melodies, harmonies galore, soaring prsychedelic imagery with enough pop to keep the teenyboppers happy. Even those venerable purveyors of British-r'n'b - The 'oo - couldn't resist digging into the garden of flower-power during that fateful year and unearthing this sublimely silly ode to pirate radio.This is the band's ""summer of love"" album, spiced with satire and Goonish humour (check out the title and album art for starters), especially in the inspired deodorant ad ""Odorono"", and ""Tattoo"", ""Mary Ann With the Shaky Hand"" and ""I Can See For Miles"", among others. All brilliantly remixed for the reissue as well.Note: The expanded edition disproves the urban myth that the band ran out of time and/or energy on ""side two"" of the original l.p. The band had recorded several jingles not originally included, but as they wanted to release a single-disc l.p. to save time & money, these extra tracks were left off."
3,Forgettable,"This album has a great concept, but lacks in the execution. The songs lack the energy of earlier albums and the improved songwriting of later albums. I know others like this album a great deal, but it strikes me as a very forgettable performance."
4,"NO U.S. SINGLE MIX OF ""MILES""!!!!!!!!!","WHY did they not include the U.S Single mix of ""I Can See For Miles"" with the heavy bass line? That's the main thing that people would WANT on a Deluxe edition of ""Sell Out""! While it's nice to hear this classic album in MONO, that glaring omission is a major ball-drop by the compilers of this collection!"
2,It's Not a Bad Album...,"I hate to say this, but ""The Who Sell Out"" is my least favorite album from The Who (only counting the albums I've heard). As much fun to listen to as Psychadelic Rock is, I don't feel The Who do Psychadelic Rock quite like The Doors or Jefferson Airplane. And I realize that the radio inserts are part of the feel for the album, but I find them to be a bit annoying. I would definitely say a fan of The Who should get this album, but anyone that is new to experiencing The Who should look at ""Tommy"" or ""Who's Next"" or ""Who Are You"". But I'm sure there are many big fans of The Who that really like this album and are most likely pleased by what they hear."
3,"Not Bad, For The Who","I gotta be honest, I bought this cd expecting some hard rock from The Who and was disappointed when I heard 60s' English music. They're pretty good (and cool) songs but don't expect heavy rock like ""We Won't Get Fooled Again"" or ""My Generation"" cause they aren't on here!"
5,Fabulous half-slip at a great price!,"I had a difficult time finding a long half-slip until my sister told me about the Vanity Fair half-slips for sale on Amazon. I bought one in the 30"" inch size. Not only did the slip fit perfectly, but it was only $12. From now on, I will be buying all my slips from Amazon."
5,Excellent Half Slip,"Don't know why these are so hard to find, considering how terrific they are! I have them in a variety of lengths and colors. You can't go wrong. They last a long time as well."
3,Worth the money,I had been looking for a slip for months when I finally just gave up & bought this one on line. It's a little longer than what I expected & seems to run a tad large. But considering the time I spent looking for a slip in the stores( not to mention what I probably would have paid) this a was a good deal.
1,terrible fest,"I have been a fan of the Horrorfest films since they first came to theaters three years ago.This year proved to be very disappointing.The only film I did like had subtitles and lacked a credible ending.I suggest that in the future the filmmakers allow the characters the opportunity to have a chance for survival and not have them totally hopeless.I know its a horror movie but if I sense that everyone in the movie is going to be killed,what is the point in watching it."
4,Fills in the 'other' characters,"While understanding the comments made by other reviewers, I can not agree on the low ratings. It was nice to have some 'action' with others in the series, i.e. sister Nancy, John and Unis and others.Not all of the series need be sea battles, in fact it was nice to have some shore duty. Certain things were very obvious, such as the end of Kate, while others were nice to see, i.e. Thomas Herrick showing up and saying John had told him about Richard asking for him at the end.It would be nice to have some happiness show up, it seems the last few books have been I loss after another. All in all, not as good as some earlier books, but not as bad as some think either."
3,getting tired,The novel was a nice revisiting of familiar characters but it seemed a little tired. I enjoyed reading it but am not looking forward to new novels if they don't get a little more spark.
4,The none Richard novels,"I am still suffering from Richard withdrawal. I continued with this book and its immediate predecessor to see how other characters tied to Richard would fair. However,I think this is my last read of Kent's books. He ought to go back and write an alternate ending to the novel where Richard was killed off. Then he could have an alternate #25 and #26 etc.. Still this book is a pretty good read for those who can accept Richard having been killed off and Adam now carrying the story."
5,Ballard's balladry on Brice originals,"Recorded in 1954, this album of Fanny Brice standards is truly a gem of a CD! Kaye Ballard gives a lot of love and energy to her performances of songs Brice made famous earlier in the century. While maintaining the essence of Brice, Ballard injects a lot of life to these rarely heard tunes. Brilliant 40 years later and surely beyond!"
4,Great Explanation of the Gifts of the Holy Spirit,Charles Spurgeon is one of the greatest ministers of the reformed church. Many of the words he speaks are authoratative and very commendable. In reading this book I found it interesting how he defined the Holy Spirit in six steps and then explained how we may use the gift of the Spirit to the glory of God. This book is very comprehensable and to the point. If you purchase and read this book be ready for a new outlook on the gifts of God.
5,A Powerful Friend,I like the other review.This is a great little pocket exhorter!It would make a great gift to a friend who needs to grow closer to the Lord.
4,Good mystery,"I learned a lot about southeast Asian culture during an enjoyable read. Although not a big mystery fan, I was hooked from the start."
4,Very Good!,"I really like this FM transmitter. I bought it to work with my iphone. It works perfectly, has plenty of stations, and was reasonably priced. The only thing I had a problem with was that I wished the cord was a little longer so you could put the iphone/ipod on the seat when charging or playing. For the money a great choice."
4,Works,I bought this one because of the price and it works fine. It doesnt have the best sound quality but it isnt broken up or bad at all. Its just like listning to the radio instead of a cd. But I dont have but just the factory radio in my truck anyway so maybe in a good sound system it does sound alot better. Would buy again.
1,another bad attempt,"After taking my time looking for an adapter for my ipod, I deiced to buy this because it had the best reviews out of the hole bunch and it was the most expensive out of all the 5 star products. well that sometimes does not work. this product is horrible. just like the rest, there is a lot of static, you drive a couple of miles and you have to change that station because the static just overtakes it all. some songs are played with the bass really high and eve though i try to adjust it with my stereo, it just cannot be done. when I bought this product it had 5 stars. Now, it is down to 3 so my guess is that I am not the only one."
5,Excellent selection of stories for a Russian Language student,"I read this book back in the early 90's as a part of my Russian Language studies, and it has never left my mind. I found the selection of stories to be engaging and often humorous. The emphasis on learning the roots of the words has been a skill that has helped me ever since to understand the language better. In particular, it helps with reading comprehension. When you come across an unfamiliar word, with a known root, it greatly enhances your chances of understanding the meaning. Excellent book for an intermediate Russian Language student."
5,A Tremendously Useful Source Book,"This is a terrific book --- well researched, clever and readable, and the ultimate source of contemporary quotations. Certainly the best of its kind available."
5,Yale Book Of Quotations,"Many hours of pleasure, humor, sober observations and philosophy. Great for getting the perfect line for just the right occasion."
5,A fun coffee table book,"In the Internet age, a book of quotations has to work hard to justify its existence. Fortunately, the Yale Book does so: It's pretty, well-organized, and consistently entertaining. Moreover, Fred Shapiro has done his homework to ensure that the quotes found in this book are reliably attributed; I don't know of any quotation website that can be trusted to omit common apocrypha, such as the bon mot commonly misattributed to Churchill: ""If a man is not a socialist when he is 20, then he has no heart. But if a man is still a socialist when he is 40, then he has no head.""If you're interested in the latest quote investigations from Fred Shapiro, he contributes to the Freakonomics blog from time to time."
1,Not very wide in range - book returned,"No new quotes that were interesting to me. I was looking for several noteable quotes from several noteable people, none of whom were cited."
4,Toe 2 Toe 2 /Glen Washington & George Nooks,"Very Good combination cd of these 2 artists, Great gospel rhythm's &Original style Reggae."
5,"Comfortable, sturdy folding chairs","The chairs are great. They came really fast. The only issues I have are that they are a bit heavy and I didn't realize I was going to need to put linseed oil on them when I got them and then to keep the same color I'll need to put a varnish on them. But they look really nice,they' re comfortable, and easy to store and move. You'll want to buy cushions for them to make them soft to sit on."
5,A must,"When paper piecing ""add-a-quarter"" is a miracle notion. When doing tiny things the ""add-an-eight"" is a god send. Really, you need these. I was skeptical until a friend let me borrow hers as a quilt retreat, the first thing I did was buy my own when we got home."
3,Complete Book of Vitamins & Minerals by Consumer Guide,"Large print, simple food lists and brief vitamin & mineral profiles make this a quick & simple reference. I find it irritating however, that the minerals profiled are not in alphabetical order and am required to use the back-of-the-book index. If you want in-depth information supported by references try Jean Carper's books and the Health Prevention Magazine books. I also liked Nutrition for Dummies."
5,A must buy!,"*****I can think of no better word to describe this book than ""neat."" I picked up ""Don't Give It Away"" at the airport because the cover caught my eye. Don't be fooled! Though it looks as though it is a book for teens, at age 31, I couldn't put it down. Since then, I've bought four additional copies to give to all the teen girls I know and love. This book is an incredible tool for all women, regardless of age. However, if you are not interested in getting to know yourself don't buy the book."
4,Helped,"As a young woman, this book was a gift and it really helped me to improve my self esteem and realize that I was actually worth something!"
3,Portugal: A Traveller's History,"The review is not focused on histoory, as the title would suggest.The style is somewhat erratic"
3,Not for weightlifting gym,"Bought this flooring system for a home weightlifting gym. These are lightweight and cushiony. Probably great for aerobics, martial arts, yoga, etc. But putting a 1,000lb rack on top of these would have compressed them too much."
2,could have been better,"There were moments when this book was a page-turner but the author kept getting in the way too much. I really don't like being addressed as ""you"" by a cheeky NewYorker especially when I'm being lectured to about how ""life is about choices"" or some other cliches. The plot was an interesting one but unravels in the second part of the book with some very unconvincing events. Also, the author didn't know when to end the book -- editors could have cut out about the last 50 pages. I kept waiting for an unanticipated twist at the end. For all the build up, the book just peters out. Disappointing."
1,Off to such a good start... what went wrong?!,"Initially, I really enjoyed this novel. Unger writes with a definitely a different style and voice for the narrator of a thriller, but at first it felt fresh and exciting. Unfortunately, it became a rather tired tale very quickly. The plot was predictable, with a solution lacking a basis in solid facts. Overall, it read more like a romance novel than a thriller. It was hokey, unimpressive and used unoriginal characters and relationships. All in all, I was rather disappointed. The most interesting thing was that the adoption motif that I just encountered in Trollope'sBrother & Sistercarried through to this book."
2,D+,"Ugg, I really did not enjoy ""Beautiful Lies."" The problem was that I was about 1/3 into it before I realized, and I wanted to see the ending. Turns out I didn't have to keep reading, because the novel concluded exactly as I'd suspected it would! In addition to the predictable plot, the main character and narrator, Ridley, annoyed me to no end. Plus the writing style was not my thing; too many ""By now you're probably thinking that I'm crazy."" stuff--just a personal gripe I guess, but I don't like it when the narrator talks to the reader."
1,Soooooo boring and very badly written.,"Ridely Jones....what did you accomplish in the end other than hurt the people that loved you the most? And for us reader's...did we get to know her 'truth' in the end? NO! what a waste of time.So many questions unanswered.So Ridely Jones still lives in blissful ignorance, with her beautiful lies...which she got so many ppl in trouble over nothing for. Should've left it that way from the begining. Was the author in a hurry to finish off the book?!?!Well,thats the feeling i got.I agree with another reader...how did this book get so many stars??Unbeleivable. Story line is so predictable, therefore, was boring and was not a page-turner. The main character,Ridely Jones...very ungrateful and immature! And the author talking directly to the readers...was such a turn-off."
3,Good story - repetitive text,"This book has an excellent idea/concept for the story, it's just not that well written. Obviously the editor didn't do a very good job editing and suggesting changes that could have moved this book into a much better category for me. The authors use of 1st person narrative is used in too loose of a ""conversational style"". She too frequently asks the reader questions about her state of mind or what we think of her state of mind and it got annoying by the end of the book. The use of foreshadowing in the opening of the book was a mistake as well because it gave away too much. It spoke of a lack of confidence in the material and was used to hook the reader rather than just tell the story."
3,"Started out great, ended up flat.","First third of the book is fabulous: exciting, tense, makes you eager to find out what in the world is about to unfold. Writing is very nice, flowing, easy, keeps you swept up in the story, I didn't want to put it down. A definite page turner. Loved our girl Ridley, the protagonist; the other characters were less than likable or interesting.Unfortunately the story soon becomes predictable...could see it coming a mile away and it began to feel repetitive. The most amazing part was that it turns out there wasn't more to it than there really was. So many implausible events, Jake turns up everywhere without even trying. And boy, by the time I got to the last page I didn't care who what or why anymore: it ends up feeling like much ado about nothing."
3,Unsatisfying ending,"I don't need for every story to have a perfectly tidy ending, but the loose ends left in this book came from such key plot points that there was really no excuse for leaving them unanswered. Lisa Unger is a talented writer - her style is straight-forward and poignant without being flowery, but the story was missing too many pieces and didn't come together the way a good thriller or mystery should.Bottom line: the story is compelling and the book is a fast-paced read, but the ending is too poorly developed for this to be a satisfying read."
3,"Fast-paced read, not great, but really holds your interest!","I wish I could give this book 3.5 stars--I think it really deserves more than 3 stars because I read it in just two sittings, but it's definitely not a 4-star book. The writing is good--not great--but good, solid. The plot is fast-paced and it did move along and make me want to read what was going to happen next and how it would all be resolved. This is the second book I read by Lisa Unger and both were pretty similar in style and pace. It was entertaining and kept me turning the pages. But a month from now, I doubt I will remember much about it."
2,Not Great,"It seems to me that the author was deliberately giving the reader clues before Ridley figured them out. This didn't bother me. What did irritate were the Jake parts that I felt should have been published by Harlequin. After the tenth time hearing about his ""ripped abs"" tattoos, and sexual prowess, I expected to look at the cover and find Fabio with a shirt unbuttoned to the navel. It was a great premise and parts were really well written so hopefully Ms. Unger's next hero will be more believable and interesting."
4,Fun Read,"I enjoy Lisa Unger's style, witty and unpredictable. She thrives on twisted family situations with a heavy dose of smoke and mirrors, which are pretty interesting. Would especially like to see more Ridley Jones stories, adding to this and Sliver of Truth. How many more oddball parents, uncles or aunts could she pull out of the closet?"
4,First book is a good effort.,"Having liked the author's latest ""Heartbroken"", I've returned to the beginning and read the first Ridley Jones book here. It seems I did like the effort overall as told in the first person by Ridley with all her thoughts and opinions. The author was able to create tension when it was needed and was well done. So I will proceed to read the second Ridley book and see what happens next. Overall, I did like the book, but it was a first book."
1,Boring,"I picked this up based on the starred review from Publisher's Weekly. What a disappointment. I read halfway through, then finally gave up. Even though very little happened, it was not believable. No cell phones in 2012? Etc."
3,good book but skimmed the last part of book-wordy,"I love Lisa Unger. This book was good and I plan on reading the sequel but it got a little boring towards the end (last quarter). It could have been because someone on here explained way too much of book and I figured I knew what happened at the end. I like her other books better...Fragile, Die for you. Both of those seemed to have more individual character dramas inside of the main drama. just a suggestion. Lisa Unger is an amazing aurthor!"
3,Decent but predictable thriller!,"Lisa Unger's debut is decent but the overall plot was pretty predictable. The writing style bothered me at times with Ridley Jones, the main charcater, talking to the reader for reasons unknown. All that being said, it wasn't bad, just a little formulaic."
3,Okay,This book was an okay read. It was a little bit predicatable. I think that the author tried to shock the readers but fell short on them at times. It's not a bad book. I bought it when it was 79 cents and it was worth reading.
2,Could Have Been Better,This is written in first peron which I hate. It was also too long. There were way too many pages of Ridley.s thoughts. The storyline was original but the book would have been much better if written at a faster pace.
5,I almost didn't buy the book because of the reviews..,"but, it was only $0.79 for the Kindle version so I bit the bullet.I read a novel or two a week and I'm not much of a critic. I see entertainment in nearly every book I read. With that being said, I really felt this particular book was definitely above average. I was hooked within the first couple of pages. The author purposely leaves you without your bearings, trying to sort out who is who. Then she reveals the story with a very descriptive narrative that left me quite annoyed when I had to put the book down to tend to life. I still managed to read it in less than 2 days, because I HAD to."
2,This is a good book....another beautiful lie,"I listened to this book on CD, it was probably the most mind numbing ten hours of my life. This book had an interesting premise but the execution left me wanting to scream. The main character Ridley was so stupid and insipid a character that I actually lost my patience. I really hate when authors are repetitive to the point of annoyance, this is one of those cases. Not only is Ridley the saddest character I have run across in a long time, not because of her situation but because of the way that her character comes across. If I were to meet here, she would get on my nerves inside of five minutes, the conversations just drag on forever. The conclusion of this book was watery and there was no ""ah-ha"" moment, just more vague conversations. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, it was recommended to me by Amazon.com because of my book purchases. Most of the time, its dead on, this book was a disappointment, big time!"
2,YAWN!,"if you didnt see this ending coming, for shame! I figured out the ""twist"" halfway thru and wondered what Unger had in store for the second half of the book. The answer? Not much at all. It was a slow, laborious read. And as the first book I read after Black Out, it was a real disappointment."
3,worth the 79 cents,"When I staerted reading this book I really couldnt put it down. It has all the ingredients for a page turner. Why the 3 stars you ask? That's one reason. She is conatantly asking the reader questions and making ""asides"" I enjoy being a bystander not a participant. I also noticed how the main character was inconsistant, smart at getting some things and slow at other times. The way the author wrote was that you really wernt too far ahead of wat the characters knew, however, when Ridley or Jake made their apiphanies found myself saying ""yeah no crap ( no $?*!) I already knew this""The book is an easy read and is a good mystery type book. I would have payed more for the book as for the most part enjoyed the read."
3,Disappointed,"I was disappointed that the this book did not sustain the wonderful promise of its early premise. I thought the characterizations and plot development were very predictable and pedestrian. I don't usually read books that are written in the first person (I simply don't like that vehicle unless it's a memoir), but I read this one because it had been recommended. Perhaps I was not enthralled because I had just finished reading two amazingly well-written novels (The Girls by Lansens and Water For Elephants by Gruen). This first effort by Unger was not as well done as these other two, so the comparison was unfavorable. It simply didn't hold my interest and I didn't value the main character as I did in the other two books. I found it very mediocre."
2,"blah, blah, blah",This book works...only if it's based on a true story. The build up took sooooo long before coming upon any real drama or intrigue (about chapter 19). There is just too much redundancy throughout.
1,Predictable and LAME,"This book is so freakin' predictable. Real-life crime stories on TV are far more entertaining and they are REAL. There were so many questions left unanswered (I smell an even lamer sequel coming on...) But the worst part??? The Q & A interview at the end of the book between the main character and the author! WTH?! So basically, the author interviewed her fictional self. Because no one else will. Because she's a terrible author. How did this ever get so many good ratings?! Do yourself a favor and find a more intelligent author who writes strong female leads and who actually does some research on law enforcement before writing about it."
2,Overwrought and annoying!,"I was looking forward to reading this book but I was so disappointed by the drippy tone of the narrator and the constant one-liner questions directed at the reader. Yuck! I also didn't understand what the big deal was over the beautiful lie, it could have been a great storyline but the action scenes and the twists felt sooo contrived. I wanted to scream, ""where was the editor?"" Needless to say, I will not be buying anymore books from this author!"
4,Good Read - Room To Grow,"I liked this book a lot. The story was gripping and fast paced, the characters well thought out and by the end of the book I wasn't left with any gaping holes in the plot or unanswered questions.Some of the plot was little predictable and in places a little far fetched but it didn't detract from my enjoyment overall. The writing style was a good indicator that Lisa Unger is going to be around for a while and enjoy some success. On the back of reading this book I will certainly purchase more of her books in the future.This isn't Shakespeare, it's not literary genius. It's fun, easy, enjoyable reading when you don't want anything too heavy."
4,Pleasantly Surprised!,"I knew before starting this book that the author is a first time novelist, but the description sounded interesting, so I thought I would give it a try. I'm really glad that I did. The story is well-written and engaging. There were a few twists and turns I didn't see coming. I'm looking forward to reading more novels by Ms. Unger."
2,Not Much of a Mystery,"This is the only Lisa Unger book I have read and I purchased it due to the low price. If I had it to do over again, I would pass. The mystery was very thin and too easy for the reader to solve. I also became very annoyed with the main character, an emotionally insecure and spoiled rich girl. I understand this is Ms. Unger's first novel. At some point I may try another, but not without sampling it first."
2,Boring...sorry,"I've got this book on my E-reader, and it only cost me 99 cents. I hadn't read a thriller in a while, so I was looking forward to reading it. Unfortunately, I was let down by the book no later than chapter 4. To me, the author tried a bit too hard to create suspense. The vibe I detected early on was something like, ""trouble's brewing."" but not in a suspenseful way. It was more as though Ms. Unger was telling us instead of just showing us and allowing it to develop. Good suspense should surprise you, thrill you, chill you, and maybe freak you out. I didn't experience any of this. In addition, the lead character, Ridley, was devoid of personality. None of the characters had any depth and I really didn't care what happened to any of them. The book inadvertently revealed itself very early on. Once I realized that nothing about it was original, it was pretty easy to unravel the mysteries. I eventually just started flipping pages until I got to the end."
1,Insipid music,"If you want to hear really bad singers from the Northwest, the whole ""Christmas In The Northwest series"" is for you. If you want your money to go the Children's Hospital, donate it directly to them, not the CD's. Children's had a great idea, but stores like Bartells & Ikea really overkilled it with advertising every 5 minutes. Ikea went so far as to have the actual singers there. The last Christmas in the Nortwest (10 or 11) had a terrible group called the Wannabee Idols singing ""I want to be Blake, I want to be Sanjaya"". Please do yourselves a favor and Donate directly to the hospital."
2,BEWARE: CD-R,"The two star rating is not for the artist or the music. I would give Sonny a 4.5 to 5.0 star rating for all of his work. But amazon keeps putting out burned copies of music with booklets void of information important to knowing who the artist is,recording info. Look for the original release you won't regret it."
5,The Guy Below Me Has No Clue,"I bought this CD years and years ago, and it has amazing staying power. The songs are fantastic (check out ""Mister Meet Your New Landlord""), and the guitar playing is supernatural. There ARE lots of brilliant slide guitar players out there, but what sets Sonny Landreth apart is the combination of his great songwriting and killer chops. He'll never be a great singer, but neither will Eric Clapton. It's all about the songs, and that's enough."
3,"Inconsistent, but with some real highlights","This is slide guitarist Sonny Landreth's first album on the Zoo label, originally released in 1992.There are few utterly forgettable songs here, but fortunately they sit next to a handful of charming, eclectic songs which aren't ""blues lite"", as another reviewer put it...most of them are not blues at all, and they aren't meant to be.Landreth blends rock n' roll, blues n' boogie, cajun, mesmerizing aboriginal rhythms, and, well, pop, creating a thouroughly personal style. The best songs here are the radio-friendly ""Bayou Teche"" and ""Common Law Love"" (which I was fortunate enough to hear Landreth play live a few weeks ago here in Denmark), but the slow, melancholy ""Planet Cannonball"" and the swaggering ""Speak Of The Devil"" are also among the highlights, and Landreth's muscular playing is always a plus.Not the place to start, but fans will certainly want a listen."
2,RANDOM AND CONFUSING THOUGHTS,"A well meaning, but totally sloppy book -- botn in writing style and clarity of thought. Interesting for the range of topics it suggests relate to its subject, although its coverage of them is aweful. It is somewhat useful for the references it offers, in case the frustrated reader is still interested enough in the topics to try and make up for the book's own failures by reading up on them elsewhere. As for the rest, it is hard to follow and confusing on all but the most elementary points."
2,Nothing new here,"Beltrami's newest is a comprehensive view of randomness without ever coming to grips with any meaning of the concept. Sure, definitions are given, but simply the usual algorithmic so prevalent in recent popular works on computers. The interesting binary-string examples are in no way random in any intuitive sense of the word; they merely serve to illustrate his somewhat prolix text. If you are new to this field, these ideas, and the development of algorithmic ""randomness"", then this is an outstanding book and to be recommended highly. If you are looking for something beyond the semantically sterile notions of reductionist randomness, then this book will leave you wondering why you bothered reading it."
2,"interesting, but pedagogically feeble","This book is contains a fairly substantial (from the layman's point of view) discussion of randomness. It discusses the fundamentals of probability, information/entropy, etc. It ends with an appendix of ""technical notes"", an appendix on binary notation and 6 pages of references. But it has no exercises, and presents its material as if the layman could assimilate it by simple passive reading. Not so. You need a paper and pencil. You need to manufacture exercises to master or even understand the material. I am comfortable with algebra and basic calculus, but got lost and gave up after a couple of chapters (I did not break out pencil and paper).If you are not mathematically sophisticated enough to just ""get it"" by reading, I suggest you buy a real textbook, where the author is actually makes a commitment to teaching, rather than mere exposition."
1,Absolutely the Worst,"This stuff doesn't dry. After waiting 8 days, we grouted, only to have the glue that still apparently wasn't dry in the middle bubble up and wreck the grout. We discovered later that many others have had this problem. The company's so-called customer service is a joke. The representative to whom I complained was extremely rude, asked the same questions over and over by phone and mail, then ended by calling me a liar. I strongly advise against anyone buying anything made by Tile Perfect."
1,No such thing,"There is no such thing as ""pre-mixed thinset"". By definition, thinset mortar mix contains portland cement, which when mixed with water, ""sets up"". Products sold as premixed thinset are some type of mastic, or glue, and don't have the same properties as thinset."
4,Good Set,"there are other Better Sets that have more Jams but this Collection has quite a few of the trademark Wilson Sound&Vibe.""Yearning for Your Love"" is still a Knock Out Slow Jam.""Burn Rubber on Me"" is still a Smoking Jam that will still pack a dance floor."
3,Cute not durable,"This is the cutest shirt. The icon on the back is adorable and the little bowling pin on the sleeve is unexpected. However, I washed this top twice, not putting it in the dryer, and the side seem came out. I had to get my mom to sew it back up."
1,What a way to destroy an excellent Story,"I absolutely loved Turning Point and Fortune's Wheel. I liked Carrie and Kusac, and even Kusac's family. Even Kaid. All that has been destroyed in this book for one main reason. Carrie and Kusac had a wonderful relationship, and there was no reason to destroy it, along with the story, but destroy it has been done. By allowing Carrie to have an approved affair was absolutely disgusting, the worse because it was sanctioned. There was no need for that. Not only that, I tortured myself by reading the later books and it only got worse.Read the first two books and STOP THERE. The rest of the books are not worth your time."
1,". . .and they mean FIRE, alright!","Well, there was no science, no logic, no true conflic (even though there is war) and a bunch of romance: this equils a no - brainer. This novel was the WORST I have EVER read, and I speak truthfully on that one. I hate this book (and the rest in the series) with a passion. I know this wouldn't apeal to the male audiance (I am woman though)To much pointless relationships and no action. All in all, I don't think it is right to burn a book, but this one sure did get my bon-fire started rather well! This book is NOT recremanded unless you like those pointless romances with no real steady plot."
2,"An entertaining read, but not much of a challenge","It says something that I've read up to the third book, but sometimes I wonder why I'm still reading it. I suppose it's because the story itself is really good despite problems in style, and the secret soap-opera lover in me likes the interplay between the characters, particularly the romance between humans and the feline Sholan. Ms. Norman has steadily improved her writing since her amateurish debut in Turning Point, but she still seems to be childish in her style . . . it's like a drama written for teenagers, with emotional histrionics, people being immature, plots randomly thrown in for tension, etc. The main draw for me is the Sholans themselves, and the touchy-feelie closeness you experience as you read. A good read, but intellectually and stylistically still immature."
3,"OK for a long plane ride, but not one I'd take home.","I found Norman's writing to be excellent at picturing what was happening, but so many things were left unsaid that I was lost as to _why_ things were happening. Character development was deep for a couple of the main players (Kusac, Carrie), but more shallow than I would have expected for the major supporters (Konis, Noni, ...).While I did enjoy this book for the plot itself, it does not stand alone outside of the trilogy very well."
5,"great, dont hesitate!","no problems. SUPER fast delivery- only 2 days and i chose standard shipping options.the product is excellent, easy drag and drop, mac and pc's, easy transfer, no software etc.great! so dont hesitate. and i got mine new for 4$ at digitalmediasource- super cheap. 2 gigs. NICE"
3,You could be better off with an 8GB,"It's a good product and it's what I bought 2 years ago but, since then, the 4GB model andKingston 8GB DataTraveler USB flash drive - High Speed USBhave been released. It would make more sense to go for the 8GB because you will get 4 times the storage capacity without paying 4 times as much (check the prices). And, of course, it's the convenience factor.However, if all you need is 2GB of storage then, by all means, get this one. The price is right and it works perfectly. I have a couple of these and I've been storing my tax records on them. The family album goes on the larger capacity model."
5,it stores your data,not much to write. it stores my data. I don't carry it around all the time. I stored thousands of digital family pics on it and it stays in the drawer.
5,very nice,great product. never had problems. it sat in may car for a week exposed to extreme heat and cold fluxuations... not to mention slight rain water. it still works great. i love it
2,Slooooooow......,"tested the drive by copying a 897Mb file back and forth. While read speed was very good - around 16Mb/sec, write speed was horrible - slightly over 2Mb/sec. In comparison, my old 1Gb Lexar drive shows 8.5Mb/sec write and 11Mb/sec read.Not to mention that there is a 15-20 sec delay between you hit 'copy' button and the actual copying dialog showing up.Did test it on my desktop and laptop.It may be just a faulty one I got, but this is my second negative experience with Kingston after purchasing their 2Gb miniSD card (also pretty slow)."
4,Kingston DTI/2GBKR Data Traveler 2 GB USB Flash Drive,"This memory is great with windows XP and Windows 2000. I could not get a driver for it to work with win98. It appears that it doesnt work with windows 98. However, the price was ok."
1,NEVER RECEIVED THE PRODUCT!,I need someone to contact the seller or remove him or her from ripping anyone else off!
2,Don't buy this product if it will go in your pocket.,"This product seemed to work perfectly well. However, I put this on my keychain, which went into my pocket. The problem is that the little white cap falls off all the time. It is too loosely fitted to the drive, making it fall off with little to no force. It was only a matter of time before the cap fell off without my noticing. Now, I have no cap, and the device is pretty worthless to me without its cap."
3,looks nice- latch sucks,"my husband purchased this gate as a block for our new puppy. Its a decent gate but installing it was a challenge(lots of screws and washers and plastic doo hickeys and poor instructions...I mean come on its should be easy! ITS A DOOR GATE!)But the real pain is the latch itself! its not easy to open or close, with one hand and its just seems rickety and unstable. I know a toy breed puppy may put more wear and tear on the gate then a toddler ( i dont know, i dont have kids) but the darn screws keep coming lose, and it rattles all the time. It looks nice, and its cool to see clearly thru to the other side, but its more difficult to open then the product claims. One hand no. two hands and a lift, yes. I end up climbing over it. I give 3 stars for the hassle in mounting and the difficulty opening and closing the latch."
1,Not worth $20,"This book is poorly constructed for the following reasons.1. Many repeats in References: For instance, Ref [91] & [140] is a repeat of Ref [11]. Ref [85] & [112] is a repeat of Ref [20]. And many more.2. Too many mistakes in contents.For example, Fig. 18 in Chapter is wrong in terms of signal playbacks.Another example is Fig. 10 in Chapter 2 is not clear which field it is. Is it perpendicular component or longitudinal component?One more example: Fig. 53 in Chapter 2 should have (a) & (b), but you don't find them in the figure.One more: Fig. 11 in Chapter 4 is exactly the same to Fig. 2 in Chapter 3.You can find many errors and repeats like aforementioned points in every chapter.I paid full price (~$120); however, after reading it, I would suggest authors to pay me back for all the errors/mistakes highlighted after reviewing the whole book."
3,Interesting but not really thought provoking,"A strangely engrossing novel of the downward spiral that is the protagonist's, Julian English, life. Set in the year right before the market crash, it's one of those novels that makes you want to scream out at the characters to mend their fences. The introduction by Updike indicated that this yarn was based in a great deal on the author's own life. Either way, although a morose tale, it was a quick, interesting read."
3,OK,"This is the story of middle and upper class society in a Pennsylvania town in the early part of the Depression. It is also the time of Prohibition. The novel focuses on the rapid self-destruction of a single man and how this process affects those around him.I found this book mildly interesting if only for the depiction of this exclusive group of people, but I found the dialogue stilted and the events that occur unrealistic."
1,Couldn't Finish It,"This book has been compared to Richard Yates' brilliant ""Revolutionary Road"" which is why I decided to read it. There is no comparison at all; this story is boring beyond belief, rife with characters who are irrelevent to the story, and led by a protagonist who I couldn't have cared less about. This book has a definite 1950's tone throughout - the female characters were so unbelievably rendered that they almost seemed like stepford wives. It's rare that I cannot finish a book - but this one seemed a huge waste of time."
1,Highly overrated,"This novel should remain forgotten in the dim past. It's a period piece, all right. Blatantly antisemitic -- and I don't think the author was making a comment on his characters in that regard; I think it was the author speaking.Boring in stretches. Long stretches.I finally gave up and heaved the book across the room.Out of curiosity, I read the author's Butterfield 8 a number of years ago and, trust me, it's worse."
2,B O R I N G,"Recommendation from HEmmigway which says it all. If you like Hemmingway, you MAY like O'Hara"
5,Lesson in Self Destruction,"Excellent study of a man bent on self destruction. Although written almost ten years afer Hemmingway's The Sun Also Rises, it has simmilar themes and I found myself comparing the two. Appointment in Samarra is very much superior as O'Hara's characters contain a passion that Hemmingway could not or would not create. Although flawed, I found myself liking both Julian and Caroline English. By comparison I learned to intensely dislike the characters of 'The Sun Also Rises'. Like Hemmingway, O'Hara's prose is compact and precise but unlike Hemmingway, the dialogue is realistic and not clumsy.Suppessedly, the characters were modeled after real people from O'Hara's hometown of Pottsville, PA. But they seemed very familiar to people each of us have probably encountered sometime during our lifetime. This makes the novel very beleivable and very readable. The book is not nearly ponderous as are some classics and can be read rather quickly."
4,sloppy but profound,"I was not disappointed with this novel, but I do not think it belongs on the best novels of the century list. While much of this book is excellent, its flaws are jarringly obvious. There are plot holes galore, characters who inexplicably appear and then are never heard from again, and so much detail that it just boggles the mind. I suspect that when O'Hara sat down to write this book, he just started typing whatever came to his mind, and without consideration for structure, grammar, or punctuation. After he was finished, he sent it off to his publisher and no one, including O'Hara, knew how to edit it. I've read several of his short stories and they suffered from these same flaws. He is, however, a matchless winner when it comes to writing dialogue; all of his characters are distinctly real in the way they talk. Alas, sometimes, I wonder what ever happened to John O'Hara; he was one of the literary lights of the first half of this century, but he is largely forgotten today."
2,"Not impressed, but I still passed","I wanted to post this review, because I must have misunderstood the purpose of these CLEP books. As was indiciated to me today by the testing center, these books are designed to refresh the memories of people who have a good knowledge base of the subject. For individuals such as myself, who haven't taken American History since the early 90's, it didn't prepare me like I expected it to.I studied this book for three months, I had a 95% on each of the practice exams, and I barely passed this CLEP. Passing is passing, I agree, but just keep in mind that this book is a framework. There were so many questions on my exam on topics my clep book didn't touch on. Good thing I like the History channel.Anyway, good refresher, but maybe it's wise to supplement with a cheap high school/college text to be safe."
2,Half of the Info you Need,"I read the whole entire book and did both quizzes. When I took the actual CLEP test the questions are nothing close to what is covered in the book. Luckily I had taken US History AP in high school which helped me in some of the questions. Don't rely on this book alone to pass the CLEP. Best advice is to get familiarize yourself with the people during the time. For example: Phillis Wheatley, Roger Williams, and what they signified. I did pass with a 54."
4,"Decent review, but you might need more....","I went through this book several times and I also used the official College Board review guide. It had 50 ""practice questions"", and most of them seemed to be on the test in one form or another. I really felt that going through the official review guide was what had the greatest impact on my score. The review section of this text is just bare bones material. It has skipped over many important people and I had issues with discrepancies between the review and the practice tests. I highly recommend using other sources in conjunction with this book to study. All and all, I got a 71/80 points."
4,Acceptable study guide,"I took this test a week ago and scored a 67. I studied for 3 months. I also supplimented this study guide with an American History book. If you're a great test taker, this guide will be all you need. I strongly suggest, even with that said, as I mentioned, to go out to the library and take out an American History book. Good Luck to all."
4,Great book,"This book was extremely helpful. Especially the practice tests. The only study material I used for this test was this book, the collegeboard test, and wikipedia. I scored a 64. Worth the money."
1,Not happy with Item,It is very difficult to buy gold via the web because the pictures do not show actual size. felt that the item was over priced. It was very thin and the baby snatched it and broke it in the first use.
2,Too difficult to shape,"I don't know if we just got an old batch of this stuff or what, but it's really hard to shape this into anything. I got this for my kids to have fun with and they were both excited, until we tried to make something. It's just these blocks that are too hard and crumbly to do much with. I gave it two stars because there are quite a few colors and if it had been fresh I'm guessing this would be fun. I think I'll try look online for ideas to soften it, if that's even possible."
5,great stuff,"A fun item for the kids to get creative with. Easy clean up. Good variety of colors, and better value in this bigger package."
1,Total Disapointment,"What a let down.... It took forever to set up, and then no matter what speed or car, some turns in some lanes would pop the car off every time. What is that about? It was such a disappointment on Christmas morning. Rats...."
4,good stuff,"Bought this for our 2 year old daughter and me to play with. Lots of fun. Dont worry about the age thing, with a little supervision she does fine with it. Its fun to watch the 2-yo tell me that the 'pickup shoes need cleaning' when the cars get jerky and then proceed to clean it with eraser.The cars are fast."
5,great slot car set!,This was a reward to my 7 year old son for working all summer on his reading skills. He spends countless hours playing with it. I like the number of set ups that you can do with it; overall the entire set is well engineereed.
1,strong odor emitted from the peel,"This pizza peel emits a strong chemical odor when wet. When I removed my pizza from the oven, I left it on the peel to cool and serve at the table. My pizza dough absorbed the odor from the peel, making the meal unpleasant. Otherwise, this peel is a good size and shape, and easy to clean. Unfortunately, I will be returning it and purchasing one made of 100% wood."
1,Resin odor gets on the food!,"I bought this pizza peel from another store (Williams-Sonoma) based on the strong reviews I've read. Sadly, I found that whenever the surface gets damp, it starts off-gassing a gluey resin odor. I've washed it several times, to no avail. Even worse, the odor gets on the food!"
1,Formaldehyde,"The pizza peel is very functional, unfortunately the smell of formaldehyde is just too much to bear. It is most noticeable when washing with warm water or leaving a hot pizza on it to cool. You can smell it on the bottom of a slice, yuck. Not too mention the possible health implications, if in fact this chemical was used to manufacture the peel. I'm surprised it has not been banned! What a waste of money..."
4,Useful kitchen tool,This peel is nice looking and easy to use. It is also easy to clean and requires no special treatment like oiling. Since I started using this peel my artisan bread maintains its shape better.
3,Fits the bill,"I bought this to move free form (""artisan"") loaves in and out of the oven more than to make pizza, and it works just fine. It's extremely thin, which is great, and seems as sturdy as my (much thicker) wood cutting boards. My only gripe, and I suspect this may resolve itself over time, is that my dough sticks to it quite too much. That may be because I'm using wet doughs (a la the ""Artisan Bread in 5-minutes a Day"" and ""Healthy Bread in 5-minutes a Day"" style), or the board just needs some breaking in.All in all, I'm really happy with this purchase."
3,Nice and thin. Kinda smells funny?,"Works great for making pizza. Nice and thin for getting under the pizza. Only problem is that after using it a couple times and wiping it down with water, it kind of smells like chemicals... Not sure if this is the glue that holds it together or what. Just something to note."
3,odd odor,"The Epicurean pizza peel is everything it's advertised....large enough for the family oven, strong enough to cut on, with a well designed edge and handle. They failed to mention (and why would they, it's hardly a good selling point?) that the peel simply has an odd odor; not ""Whatz that sink? I'm gonna puke! You can eat my pizza!"" But a subtle odor that makes me wonder if it was worth gathering organic, locally grown ingredients for my handmade pizza only to serve it up on something that gives off an unidentifiable chemical scent."
5,"Large,sturdy and very useful",My wife ordered this for us after my old one (more than 10 years old) finally split in two. This one is very sturdy and has more surface area than our old one. We have been able to cut the pizzas on it and it doesn't leave a single mark. We really like it.
2,Peel emits strong odor,"I purchased this item in Dec. This peel gives off an overpowering chemical-like odor when handwashing as well as when removing a hot pizza from the oven. This nauseating odor is absorbed into the pizza crust which ruins the meal. I even tried using to only transfer the pizza from the oven onto another cutting surface and it made no difference. Aside from this, I like the design and size of the product. However, I intend to use it as a trivet rather than a pizza peel and purchase a different brand as a replacement."
1,Disgusting smell,"As others have noted, this peel emits a disgusting smell that absorbs into the bottom of a pizza, loaf of bread, or whatever else you use the peel for. I don't know whether it's dangerous to eat, but it smells like burnt tires and will completely ruin your meal. The smell actually passed through a layer of parchment paper and right into my pizza.I guess the company didn't bother testing this product?Avoid, at all costs. Especially if it's really formaldehyde. What are we, lab specimens?"
5,Fantastic read.,"I, too, stumbled on this book and was drawn into the story from the very beginning. It is so beautifully and vividly written giving the reader a fantastic journey somewhat like ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" for Ireland and the French countryside. The characters are so well-developed that they emotionally capture as they come to life off the page. For me, it was also a lesson in tolerance and acceptance of the power of so many kinds of love. Read it and weep. Read it and cheer!"
4,awesome,"I received this item quickly and in good shape. I listen to it all the time, it's one of my favorites. It's amazing how influential these women were to music, and to hear it on cassette sets the mood for listening to the album. It's interesting to think about how revolutionary these ladies were at the time."
4,"Great book, but....","This book has a bunch of very nice patterns. Many that I would like to make. She also makes substituting yarn easy by giving all the information you'd need to choose your yarn. The reason that I give it four stars instead of five is because of the limitation in sizes. For all the patterns that require a size: hats, gloves, mittens, slippers, and socks, everything is sized for ""an average adult women."" It would have been nice to have had more of a size range included, and also things sized for children. While I may have an average adult women's head and feet, my hands are definitely on the small size, which means shortening fingers, etc."
1,Failed after twenty-two months,I purchased this unit 22 months ago and it did just fine charging a backup generator's battery until about 2 weeks ago. I noticed both lights blinking and that half of the acid was gone in the battery! I unplugged it and the unit literally started smoking. Yikes.I am disappointed that this unit failed in such a short time.
4,Small But Mighty,"I have purchased a total of five of these charges over the past several years. I use them to keep the batteries charged on a number of pieces of farm equipment. They work well in both the warm summer months and the cold Michigan winter months. With a large number of animals to feed, it is very important that the equipment start when needed. I highly recommend this product."
1,Garbage,"Worked nicely for about three months. Then just stopped. Lights come on and it hums a little, but no voltage at the leads. Warranty is worthless so it is now in the trash."
5,Deltran Smart Charger,"I ordered the Deltran Smart charger (tender) as it's the same unit that BMW uses. It had nothing but great reviews and so far I'm very pleased. I have it hooked to my Generater to keep the battery charged and ready as it's Hurricane season in FL. They claim their charging method will actually make the battery last longer, that would be nice, but time will tell. Comes with two end, standard clips and type that you can bolt on to the battery lugs. There is a disconnect in the cable so you can leave it attached to the battery and just plug the charger. The side on the battery even had a nice little plug so you can't short out the battery if the cable is moving around after being disconnected. Very pleased so far and would buy another one if I needed it."
4,Does the job,Works well outside in freezing weather and doesn't take a long time to charge a 12 volt battery. I like the options that come with it.
5,Battery tender plus 12V,"These battery tenders are by far the best on the market in my opinion.... At these prices you can justify more than one considering they sell for $100 dollars at the part store, for just one!!!! As long as your battery is not drained completely it will keep them up and charged..."
3,ok,"Battery Tender 021-0156 Battery Tender Plus 12V Battery Charger True Gel Cell ModelBought this Item for my Son-in-Law and I had it shipped directally to him. He has not commented on this Battery tender/charger, so I assume that it works satisfactory.Battery Tender 021-0128 Battery Tender Plus 12V Battery Charger"
1,Zero stars. DO NOT BUY!,"I was initially less than impressed that it took over 4 days to recharge my boat battery, then after the second use (following all directions) the unit just up and quit working. I come to find out that Amazon will only give me a partial refund for this piece of crap and I have pay for shipping, again! This is the third time I have purchased sub-standard, non-working items through Amazon, and I guarantee it will be the last. I will be taking my business elsewhere from now on."
2,it is bad product,"this is bad , It is too so long to charge , spend more than a day and ahalf to finish . Please don't buy it waste $"
1,Battery Tender 021-0128 Plus 12V,"I have a 2000 Yamaha Road Star and was having starting problems because the battery was always low on current probably due to the built-in digital clock and the fact that I do not ride for long periods of time. I always had to pull out my battery charger at the most inopportune time. This product solved that problem. I had to install the quick disconnect cable to the battery terminals and then it was all downhill. The battery tender stays plugged into a 110 AC current and I just plug the bike in when I get back from a ride. The next time I use it, the battery is fully charged and my bike starts easily. I installed a separate on-off switch to the battery tender so that it was not drawing current when the bike is not attached. Great product!"
5,Battery Tender is Definately a Winner!,"This is my second Battery Tender Purchase. I've had the first one for 2 years and it still works like a champ. This is a great product as I have two corvettes and a lawn tractor. I use the battery tender between seasons on the lawn tractor to keep it's battery fresh and ready for use. Same with my corvettes, as I use one for winter and one for summer. That's why I purchased the second unit. The battery Tender is a great product, all you do is hook it up and it works every time! What more could you ask for in a product?"
5,Battery Tender Plus - Better than expected,"I originally bought the Battery Tender Plus in November 2009 for over-wintering my motorcycle battery. Here in Michigan you're lucky to get 5 decent months of riding. I now alternate it every three weeks between batteries in the motorcycle, a riding lawnmower and a second automobile. It now never takes more than an hour or so to top-off any of the batteries. It definitely outperforms the other battery chargers I used in the past!"
5,MUCH better than my cheap-o charger,Charges much faster than my cheap-o charger... I would recommend the 25' adapter if you plan on charging things that may or may not fit into the garage. (because we either don't keep them perfectly clean or you don't feel like backing out the minivan... but mainly because I'm lucky to have a walkway in my garage that I can safely walk through.The indicator lights are a nice touch if you're charging multiple batteries and don't remember when you put them on the charger.
4,Battery Tender,"Previously owned a battery tender Jr. and it works well so I decided to buy this one for my Corvette winter storage battery maintainer. Battery Tender has a very good warranty also, everything is working fine."
5,Keeps batteries going,I park my car unused for quite a long period of time and this makes sure its always fully charged and ready to go. I also use it to charge up the battery in my ride on lawnmower before winter storage.There really isn't a reason not to have one of these.
4,A great machine for a great price :),Received this item very fast. I shopped for some time and could not come up with a better machine for the money. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a basic one stop battery charger that does it all.
5,Keep your classic ready,"This Battery Tender is my second. I have two cars with special insurance, so they sit in the garage for a month or more at a time. Battery Tender makes sure they're ready to do when it's a nice day for a drive."
5,Battery Tender Plus,"I am so happy I got this for my motorcycle while it sits in storage all winter. I should have got one of these three years ago. It is simple to hookup, use, and is quite as a mouse. Having one of these will prolong the life of your battery, especially in the colder climates like mine. It keeps the battery ever so slightly warm and it get's below zero in MN a lot. Eric D., Wanamingo, MN"
3,works OK but plug broke apart,The tender works well enough but after a few years the grounding prong pulled loose of the plug. I cut the unit's plug off and replaced it. This unit keeps the battery charged but I've noticed my voltmeter reads well over 14 volts every morning so it seems to me that this unit is keeping the battery barely charged instead of fully charged.
5,Works great,This is the second battery tender I have purchased. It does the job. No fuss. Keeps the battery in the cars fully charged and running well.
5,even better than my other one!,"12/23/12 over a year and still very happy. Have kept it outdoors (covered) to keep trickle on a larger quad, or on a diesel truck with two HD batteries that doesnt get driven much. VERY happy with quality and functional use, and as stated originally, it has higher amperage which is better for some charging uses.--11/6/11 higher amp which was recommended for initial charge of quad battery. I have two other tenders..this is the best and highest rated. USe it on two quads, and Diesel truck with HD batteries. works great to tend.charge all."
5,Battery Charger,"This product does exactly what it's suppose to do and is very easy to use and setup. I would recommend this for all my friends. Especially, anyone who owns an antique car and stores it for the winter."
5,Very Awesome!,I love this little guy! Do your research and you'll come to you need more than just a trickle charger for your batteries. I live in Montana and the winters are bitter cold. In my un-heated and un-insulated garage I have 5 batteries hooked up in a series (not their recommend way for this product but has worked for me 3 years) I just make sure the positive lead from this maintainer is on one end of the batteries and the negative is on the opposite end of the positive lead. That way it tends to act like one big battery. Just make sure your battery is charged before adding it on this device.As long as its lasted me I would be another if it fails but even with my setup it doesn't have to work very hard so I am expecting it to last a lot longer.Recommended product buy this brand!!
1,buy a different brand,"I own several vehicles and motorcycles and I had one of the pre china battery tenders and it lasted for several years. it did so well I bought 3 more of the battery tender pluses at one time at Christmas 2010.one worked for about 9 months and then would not go into the float mode. It killed the battery from overcharging. hooked up the next on a different battery and it worked about 2 weeks before doing the same thing(not going into float mode). the 3rd one lasted less than a week........... each has a 10 year warranty so I phoned deltran and spoke to their ""tech"". he cannot understand my problem........ tried on different batteries. plugged into outlet first blah ,blah ,blah. I paid over a $100.00 for 3 of these chinese junk.I can send them back and they will check at my cost if nothing is found wrong I would be charged a service fee and return shipping. poor customer service ,bad quality. for what these cost they should last."
1,Battery UNtender,I purchased the Battery Tender for my motorcycle. I don't ride in the winter and needed to save my battery. In the spring I tried to start bike and battery was dead. The Battery Tender had boiled all the water out the the battery. Freak Accident? The next year I used Battery Tender again. I checked battery after a month and Battery Tender had started boiling water out of battery. I disconnected and donated it to Waste Management.
3,Battery Tender Lights Failure,"This Battery Tender is a replacement to cover the time period while the original I purchased was sent back for repair.There are two lights on the front of the unit. A red light indicating the unit is charging and a green light indicating the unit is in a maintenance mode.After three years both lights had failed and I no longer trusted the unit as I didn't even know if the unit was on, much less whether it was charging or in maintenance.The good thing is that the units are warranted for 10 years, but you do have to pay $12.95 to have a unit repaired under that warranty."
5,Gotta have it,"After having my motorcycle battery discharge due to the alarm and stereo system, I bought the battery tender. I have not had an issue since. I also use it to keep the batteries for my back up sump pump system fully charged. This product is a must if you have batteries sitting idle. There is a natural discharge rate, and if you don't keep your batteries charged, they will fail you when you need them most. Spend the money and buy this product. 5 years of trouble free service earned this a 5 star rating."
5,Perfect,"Exceeds expectations, battery always ready on my motorcycle all winter long! What more can i say? Ok is that enough words forya?"
1,Deltran battery charger destroyed batteries,"I bought a Deltran Tender battery charger to maintain my battery to achieve a longer battery life.It resulted in the opposite.the charger caused the battery acid to boil out over night.I Notified Deltran,they assured me that every thing is OK with their charger.Refused to take the charger back or even analyze the problem.their attitude: we are right,customer is stupid.I contacted the manager again after coming across a warning at : http://batteryminders.com/forms/mastheads/aircraft/service_alert_batterytender.pdfverifying my identical findings.The Deltran charger over voltage causes the battery to be destroyed.Deltran assumes no responsibility for their absent quality control and sorry engineering.Customer service is absent,non caring. we will find a new sucker attitude.Instead of prolonging my battery life,it caused destructionI bought a charger from Battery Minder which is working fine"
2,Good While It Lasted,"I purchased the Battery Tender Plus to keep my two jet ski batteries charged thru the winter. I alternated between them each week. The jet skis were kept in a covered boat house. The BT plus lasted about 5 months and one day I noticed no lights on the unit. I tried other outlets, but the unit was dead. The 10 year limited warrenty will cost me $19.95 (their evaluation, shipping and handling fee) for them to replace the unit, plus my cost to ship it back to them (probably at least $8.00). Very disappointing. Maybe the humidity killed it. You would think it was more robust. I guess if you use it in your living room it will last a long time, but I don't store my jet skis there."
5,Great Little Unit!,"This unit is much smaller than I thought (about inches high by 4 inches wide by 7 inches long). It works great to keep my lawn tractor battery charged up. The cables that come with the unit are about 5 ft. long and the power cord is probably 5 ft. long as well, so if you are using in a garage and want to leave you batteries on their equipment, getting the 25 ft. extension cable would be a good idea."
5,Great for classic car storage,This was the second Battery Tender I purchased now that I own two classic Mopars! Simply hook it up and forget it. BT is a great product and I could not find a price lower than Amazon.
5,JNP ATV Adventures,"This is a great way to keep your ATV battery charged over the month your ATV is in the garage. Very simple to use, plug it in and forget about it."
4,Charger,"Easy to use, easy to set up, long cords to reach under the hood and working exactly how I hoped"
4,Tends all my batteries,Works better than a conventional charger. Will not overcharge and can be left connected indefinitely. This will prevent early battery failure in vehicles that are not used regularly.
1,dont realy work,if battery weak dont expect this device will renew it I try didnt work still I have to buy new battery
2,The charger does not charge the car battery,Bought the battery tender for my Toyata truck which is parked most of the time. The tender had been plug-in to charge the truck over couple weeks and when time to use the truck the battery drain truck can not be started. It just click click. I though the battery tender suppose to keep the battery charged at all time.
5,"Slow charge, but supposed to be!","Used this to charge my 2000 F150 battery that sat mostly idle outside during the winter here in Montana. It was really simple to use, and since I didn't need my truck instantly, I allowed it to trickle charge for 3-4 days. After the light indicated it was ready, I installed the battery back into the truck and had an instant start. I used my truck for the next 3 days and started every time with the battery indicating everything was normal. Great price and great tool."
2,battery charger,Although this charger might be good. I tried to charge a 12v battery and nothing happened. If thE battrery is too small in capacity or the charge is too low it wont charge.A little expensive for it not to work as ypu expected.
2,gary,The transformer burned up on mine. However it was on a car in the hot sun. It did last over a year and used it to keep a battery up on a car that set idle for two months.
2,Did not work for me,"I monitored the charge of my car's battery with a voltmeter and observed sustained over-voltage (14.7V) instead of maintaining a float charge. I thought I could detect this and just turn the AC off, but there was a rapid discharge (immediately dropping to 11.9V) when I cut the AC supply. After disconnecting the charger, the voltage recovered to 12.25V (50% charge).Some of this may be due to the state of the battery, or the fact that I have a constant 2W load, but a different charger (Schumacher) is working fine under the same conditions.I am returning this product."
5,"Great charger, Great price","I love this charger. It is the second one I've purchased. This price was the best out there, great value."
5,Hanlds My Motorcycles,Works perfectly - I have used these in the past. Old one lasted over 7 years - then I hit it by accident
5,Comes with everything you need,"Came with everything I needed to hook up to my BMW K1600GTL. Must hook up directly to battery because of the cam bus system used, not allowing you to use the power ports for charging. Took 15 minutes to install."
2,battery tender,"although this ""trickle charger"" is easy to handle and attach, it doesn't automatically shut off as it was advertised to do. It gives a signal (blinking green light) that the battery is over-charged but doesn't change to plain green indicating ""charged."" Since I am a novice at this, I was very careful to order one that was advertised as doing things automatically."
5,Deltran SuperSmart Battery Tender,"This product is really, really good. Don't waste your money on anything but the best! You won't be disappointed. It charges 6 and 12 volt batts (one at a time) and does not allow them to overcharge, then trickle charges to keep them optimum.Deltran SuperSmart Battery Tender Plus 12-Volt 1.25 AMP Battery Charger"
5,Performs as advertised!,"Wonderful product. We don't drive very far or very often and thus our battery was sluggish in cold weather and even went dead after listening to the radio for 15 minutes while my wife was shopping. I now ""top up"" the battery with the tender once a week and have had absolutely no problems since getting it."
1,Battery Tender Plus,"Bought this because of all the reviews, but it did not work for me. My Harley uses an AGM battery, and found out after the purchase that this charger cannot charge an AGM battery. For a simple battery maintainer, this product is big and heavy. I expected more."
4,"Good, but be aware of your car's electrical details","Easy to use, clear instructions, and does what it says. However, I also purchased the attachment to hook it to the cigarette lighter- this will NOT work in most cars since the ignition has to be on in order for the lighter to be connected to the main electrical circuit. Other than that, a good product!"
3,Cords extremely stiff in cold climate.,"Not sure if this unit is as good as the Yuasa, but I believe it is a little lower in price. My big complaint with this AND the Yuasa battery tender is that the really nice thick cords get extremely stiff in the very cold weather we get in Interior Alaska. Warm the cords inside and one minute later outside at 0 degrees and they are stiff as a board again. It's also very hard to get the thick cords straightened out from the small folds they use for shipping. It's like they have a ""memory"". Oh well."
4,It doesn't work for a dead battery so make sure you have another charger.,Don't think this will replace a normal battery charger. Use it for what it's design for which is to maintain a good working battery. If your battery is dead to the point where the starter doesn't even click. This unit won't recharge your battery. My first one failed after about 7 years and it completely killed my battery. When the red and the green LED are both flashing and you have it properly connected. Take it off immediately. I'm giving it 4 stars because a failed unit also ruined a good battery.
3,Battery Tender,"After having to replace the battery in my 2003 Porsche Carrera for the second time in four years, I got the Battery Tender to keep it charged up while it sits in the garage. (Like most German cars, the Porsche has a lot of electronics that use battery power while the car sits.)So far, the Battery Tender has worked perfectly. It is easy to use, soundless, and rugged.The only complaint is when I got it I noticed something loose rattling around inside the unit. Looking through the vents I can see its a small piece of white plastic. The unit is riveted together, so I can't open it to remove the loose item. It doesn't seem to affect the operation, so I'm not going to worry about it. But that limits my rating to three stars, otherwise it would have been four."
3,cannot be used with dead or battery or low charge,So this is OK for trickle charging a battery that is not used often - and you can plug it into an outlet. The instructions clearly state that that it will not work with a dead battery or one with low voltage (below 3 v). Also - keep in mind you need to be next to an outlet.Still look for something to charge my dead battery.....
1,Deltran Tender Plus Fails,"I purchased a Deltran Battery Tender Plus less than one year ago at an auto show in Atlantic City, NJ - It worked fine for about 6 months or so. When checked I found that it was not charging (no lights lit in any manner) Called Deltran -Informed to mail in the charger (I could not find any receipt) (cost $11.73 to mail to their Florida address.) Just received a call after about three weeks that yes, the charger had failed and that I was to get a new one....NOW THE CATCH - I had to pay an additional $17.95 for shipping to get the replacement... So far I would have out of pocket $29.68 for a charger that failed within the first year of use. No more Deltrans for me...Asked to have the bad one shipped back to me so at the next club meeting I could respond to the members of what had transpired and show them the faulty charger."
4,Good product works as advertised,"I have 2 corvettes and a motorcycle that have dead batteries if they sit (sometimes less than a week in the case of the corvettes)... the battery tender I hung from the ceiling of the garage so that I can reach all 3 vehicles. I installed extra quick connect harness's on the 3 and rotate the charger between them every few days. It dose what it claims and keeps all three so they will start. Longer cords on both the tender and harness would be a big improvement, even if only an extra 2 feet."
5,Battery Tender Plus,"After owning this for only a short duration, this seems to be the ticket to a longer lasting battery. For a vehicle that sits more that it is driven this is certainly cheaper than the headache of a dead, and possibly damaged battery. Very small size with nice build quality and cables."
5,Works great,This battery tender does the job as advertised- works great for me. Use it on all my lawn equipment and ATVs etc
5,Great Product,Works as described. I have a vehicle that is seldom driven and had experience battery chrge issues. I needed a product to keep it charged without damaging the battery.
1,Not recommended - had three of them fail within a few months,I had high hopes for this product after reading other reviews. My own experience was very disappointing. The first one I ordered from Amazon failed. I sent it back to the manufacturer at a cost of $10. The replacement unit failed. I returned it to the manufacturer at a cost of $10. The second replacement has now failed. I am going to throw it in the trash and will never buy another one of these. It was a very expensive and painful mistake.
5,works great,"I bought this for my motorcycle while garaged over the winter and I love it easy to setup, convenient, nice features easy to install pig tails for quick connect works great."
5,battery tender plus,"This is my third battery tender plus. I use them on cars, mowers and bikes and they have always worked 100%.."
4,good product,"Bought the Batter tender plus.. it works great no complaints fully auto, does everything, just plug it in and leave her alone. NO worries. Maybe a bit overpriced.. i know there are cheaper chargers out there.. maybe its just paying for the name.. i dont know.. but anyway, im very happy with mine."
5,"Great Product, good price","Great product, just as described. Have only used it a few times, but seems to be just what I needed. Fast shipping too."
5,"The Best Battery Charger, Conditioner & Maintainer","That's right, The Best! I have 6 of theses units from .75 amps per hour to 6.5 amps per hour. They make the regular batteries in my jet skis, motorcycles, last 5 or more years and the truck camper AGM 125 amp hour battery stays topped off. I've had 1 of my battery tenders since 2003. As I get new toys I get a matching charger for it. I hate buying batteries. These are much less expensive.......by a long shot."
5,Battery Tender 021-0128 Battery Tender Plus 12V Battery Charger,This is good for what it is made for slowly charge then maintain a car batt.I like that it comes with two cords one can be hooked up perment then if you have a temp. use you can unplug an use the alagator clips .
5,Deltran Battery Tender,Excellent product. Deltran makes excellent quality products. Order received quickly from Amazon as always.
5,Great product,"This product works EXACTLY as advertised. Easy to install and ""idiot prof."" If you leave you vehicle parked for extended periods of time, you need a Battery Tender. (No I don't work for the company.)"
5,excellent product,Now I don't have to worry about a dead battery. Just plug the battery into the tender and I know the battery is going to be fully charged for the next start.
5,Battery Tender Plus,Arrived very timely without any problems. Unit works great! Would strongly recommend this battery charger for all those batteries that sit out in the garage all winter and usually end up dead.
4,Battery Tender Plus,"To date, my usage for the Battery Tender Plus has been very successful, dependable and user friendly. For my application, it was the right product at the right price. My purchase online with Amazon was cheaper than at the local retail stores."
4,charger is a charger,"took charger out of shipping box only to hear a screw rolling around inside of it. i have used this item and there dont seem to be a default with it, tell me how you rate a charger it works and does what it does ,charger is working 4 stars cause person shipping could of pick up a different one to ship instead of shiping the one with the screw rolling around."
2,Useless warranty,"The good: while it lasted, it seemed to do the job. This is my second Battery Tender, the other being a Jr.This unit died some time in the first four months after purchase -- hard to say exactly when, as it was sitting in the garage tending a motorcycle.You don't get to see the warranty until you get the unit, but here it is:[...]It's a ten-year warranty... but if you use it outside the first 90 days, you pay $12.95 on top of return shipping for the unit. A very limited warranty indeed. At that point you're half-way to the price of a new one!(Considering that it's plasticky and Made in China, I'd guess that $13 more than covers the replacement cost of the unit...)If you want quality, go for a CTEK unit instead."
5,BATTERY TENDER STILL THE BEST ON THE MARKET,"This is the second Battery Tender I have purchased. I purchased my first Battery Tender Plus 15 years ago and it is still working fine. I use it to keep a charge on my motorcycle, boat, and lawn tractor batteries over the winter storage months. I needed an additional charger this year and based on my previous experience, I didn't hesitate to buy a Battery Tender Plus again. The new one works great, just like the 15 year old one! If you need a trickle charge type battery charger to maintain your batteries while in off-season storage, I strongly recommend the Battery Tender Plus. You will not be disappointed."
3,Outstanding brief stories of some very brave men,A nice book if you don't like long drawn out stories. IThe author tells about 12 explorers of the old American West. Moring does not get long winded and keeps the stories brief but still entertaining. A real nice book to read on a weekend.
3,Good thing these were pack of 12...,"My only qualm with this product that these markers seem to run dry quickly. I used them to draw a ton of medium sized circles across a 16 x 20 canvas...it took 9 of the 12 markers to complete. I am glad it was enough for my use, but I just feel like it's a waste to have to throw out all these empty pens. I would not suggest these if you have a bigger project that would require a lot of area to cover. Otherwise, the quality is a perfect silver color as advertised."
3,Excellent Quality Paints - They just don't have much in them,"I use the markers in my CNC machine to draw on large sheets of plastic. I've yet to find a better item that replaces these. I have no problem with them except that they only come filled with about 20-25% of the pen with ink. I really would not care if they were 2x or 3x the price if they filled them up because they end up running out, requiring me to remove the old one, mount in a new one and then re-run the job. Sharpie people - if you read this, offer up an ""industrial"" version of this marker that is actually filled up with paint - I'll play more for it."
1,HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I ordered 2 sets of 12 markers, pay $15 shipping and get 2 markers. What a deal. Good luck with the customer service!"
2,not what i was expecing,not what i was expecting. installed into car as lighting for feet. turns out this has got to be the weakest lights ive ever seen.it cant illuminate anything farther than three inches from it
1,Boring!,This book was surely a disappointment.I always wanted to read Hemingway's novels and am sad that I started with this book.I could not understand what the author was trying to convey except that all the characters in the book are drunks fighting over a woman on a picnic.The characters are good but the plot is weak.
1,THE SUN ALSO IS BORING...,"It is a funny thing. Some people, to say that they are ""erudit"", ""intelligent"", ""cult"", accept anything their teachers or friends tell them that is good, without questioning the real quality of the book they're reading. Because everybody says that Hemingway is a genius (he is), one can't assume the fact that this book is a pile of garbage; it is pure crap. DOn't come to me saying that this is a great portrai of the lost generation, blá, blá, blá. There is no plot at all, the character are ridiculous, the narrative style makes one want to kill the writer. ANyway, if you like to read a history that has absolutely no history in it (only characaters wandering through Paris and Pamplona), this is the right book..."
1,Not a very good book.,I was forced to read this book for my English class. I really don't understand why this book made him popular. It was a pointless book that should have never been written. The worst character is Lady Brett. She is a whore. She only uses Jake when she needs to be comforted. I hope that this book will be removed from the required reading list of American High School students in the near future.
3,Pretensious Drunks,"Big Deal. The only interesting character is Lady Bret Ashley, and this is only because she is so pretensious and dull witted that it brought out a severe hatred in me.Good writing style but not much doing here otherwise. I wish this generation would stay lost, they're very, very boring."
1,Confused,I am an avid reader but I had never read Hemingway before. I don't get it. This book read like a ten year old wrote it. I realize this was written when hex was in his 20's and this was supposedly a new writing style but it sure didn't feel like a modern classic. JMOO.
4,Who needs adjectives?,"This is a wonderful book. The laconic prose can be refreshing. It captures (I assume) the emptiness and indifference of the ""lost generation."" This is evidenced on a textual level by Hemingway's fondness for short, sober sentences devoid of exuberance. There are moments of emotion, but they are confused, realizing the characters' impotence to express themselves or even know what they are feeling. The last lines of this book are chilling."
3,A surprisingly powerful aftermath,"This didn't particularly impress me while reading it, then surprisingly left me with a deep sense of tragedy afterwards. The core of the novel - Jake Barnes' love for the self-destructive Brett Ashley - was very strong and subtle. It provoked sympathy and sadness. One could imagine them carrying on the way they were for the rest of their days, and that was rather depressing.I would also read this for the era and atmosphere evoked - the frantic bullfighting fiesta in 1920s Spain - as well as the hedonistic yet jaded perspective through which it was experienced. As for faults, I found certain protracted descriptions difficult to plow through (a consistent problem with Hemingway). This book dipped into 'boring' territory now and then."
5,Hemingway blesses us with his simplistic style.,"I truly enjoyed the clarity that Hemingway conveyed in a book where most people were drunk most of the time. However, the story does go deeper than a bottle of wine. Hemingway touches upon the attitudes and fears of English people living abroad in post-war Europe. The bull-fighting scenes are amazing in their vivid depictions of the sport. I don't even like or agree with bull-fighting and he managed to romanticize it enough for me. The characters are intriguing and very entertaining in their various relationships. I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in Hemingway or anyone who is about to visit Spain."
4,"Great, but not so for first-timers","First of all, let me say this. This is a good book. I like it. But, If you haven't read any Hemingway before, don't make this your first! I beg you! You will be prejudiced against all other Hemingway books. Read The Old Man and The Sea. Aside from that, get this book. It really conveys that ""lost generation"" feel like no other."
3,Aimless,"I really enjoy Hemingway's writing style, and especially Old Man and the Sea, but this book, like The Green Hills of Africa really has no direction. Most of the book is spent eating and drinking in this cafe and that during a seven day fiesta in Spain, but at the conclusion, I thought ""what was the point?"" Good desriptive, easy to read prose, but if there was a significant plot, it was lost on me."
5,Might be Heningway's finest,"The Sun also Rises is a wonderful novel which established Ernest Hemingway as the voice of the Lost generation. Writing in powerful, sporadic prose, Hemingway has the unique ability to bring exotic places to life. Who doesn't yern to see Paris and Spain after reading this book? Hemingway eloquently gives us round characters and tells the story with remarkable mood, and tone. The book as an interesting after-glow to it as well."
5,the sun also rises,"Hemmingway's writings are vivid and picturesque. He makes Jake Barnes, the lead character, seem like he's right next to you. Indeed, more like your partacking in the adventure. I'm not much for bull fights but that did not deter from the enjoyment of reading about the running of the bulls in Pamplona or the bull fights themselves. He makes the restaurants and bars seem like a life in themselves. Hemmingway is a great writer. I'm on my way to reading his next book. Tommy"
4,Pretty good novel. But not for everyone.,"This was an interesting novel. It's a very simple story of some friends who go on a trip to a festival in spain. There are no real outstanding or shocking events in the book. It's just a narrative of a normal excursion. This book is not for everybody, many would find it extremely dull. But if you look closely, you see the underlying themes of a struggle for purpose in Post World War 1 europe. It's a pretty good book. I do think it's slightly overrated though."
1,The Sun Also Rises,"I read this book anticipating Hemingway's sparse, minimalist use of language, but I quickly became disenchanted with the style. It may have been innovative in its time, and such a sere but straightforward use of the language may be appropriate for other subjects (I'm thinking of The Old Man And The Sea), but in this instance I found it simply impoverished and, oddly, pedantic."
5,A Definite Read,"I liked this book a lot. It may not have the deepest meaning, but if is a fun read about drinking, bull fighting, and women. If you would like to read similar books I would read Hemingway's Green Hills of Africa or Hunter S. Thompson's The Rum Diary."
3,Why the hype?,"My first taste of Hemingway and I've got to say I'm very disappointed. His style is crisp and economical and I like the dialog. Outside of that, there is no huge conflict here to keep you turning pages, save for Jakes love of Brett. I just got to the stage where I just didn't care what happened to Jake, Cohn or any of the others or where they were travelling to.I still have Men Withhout Women to read but I will more than likely shift it to the bottom of the pile. I think Graham Greene is a much better writer. Greene writes with style and keeps you turning pages, i.e. The Quiet American."
3,"Classical Hemingway, need I say more?","Actually, I shall say a bit more. If you are looking for a cliche product of Hemingway, search no farther. It has a great style, flow, great diction. However, it is a very dry story. Through symbolism and imagery and anecdotes, Hemingway manages to describe a theme that could have been described in two paragraphs. Suggested for Hemingway fans. Not so much for anyone else."
2,Lost in the detail,This book reminds me of a painting that has so much detail that you can't figure out what the artist is trying to say.
2,The Sun Also Rises,"I thought the book The Sun Also Rises was a book for ""book worms."" The book was ok, I guess. It was some what interesting. I thought that the book was kind of boring also. I'm not a big reader so I guess that makes a big part of it. It's considered a classic and a great book because of who it was written by and the fact that the book was written in the 30's."
1,Ugh.,"I really don't like this book. There's no plot - all they do is go to parties. All the symbolism and meanings I was suppose to find, I couldn't understand. Either its too shallow or its way over my head, I'm not sure which."
1,Really Dislike,"I can honestly say that this is the first book I have ever really disliked, and I have been an avid reader of all types of books for decades. I honestly gave it a chance even though I wanted to stop reading it about 1/3 of the way through. Having never ever not finished a book, I labored on. It was full of boring descriptions and antics and none of the characters had any substance. When I did get to the end I asked myself, ""What was the plot?"""
3,The Sun Also Rises,"THE SUN ALSO RISES is about a group of expatriates who are living in Paris. They go to Spain together for a week long fextival to see the bull fights. This is the first book I have read by Hemingway and I got tired of his writing style. While the topics that he wrote about really interested me, I think that he could have gone deeper into his subjects than just describing everything that happened in such great detail. I talked to my English teacher and she said that Hemingway focused on making his writing perfect and he achieved this by including every detail to make the reader know exactly what was happening. I really enjoyed the different characters in the novel, especially Brett. I also enjoyed seeing a relationship develop between Brett and the skilled bullfighter."
4,A war story,"The book is about war and falling in love and losing it in the end.His since of charactarizing himself differently than the other characters, makes the reader feel that story could have actually taken place in history.I would reccomend this book to any one that like both love and war stories."
2,"Dated, Dusty and Getting Rusty","When S.A.R. first came out in the 1920's, a review of the day said that Hemmingway's prose,""...put conventional English to shame."" Well, that was then, this is now. The more I read it the more I wanted it to end. Is it entirely possible that in the American myths about Papa's alcohol soaked hunting and fishing trips, we've elevated the work because we wanted to like it as we seem to like the man? Hemmigway is the perinneal 'Uncle That We All Wanted', but a much better and true account of the Lost Generation authors in Paris is A Moveable Feast, please read it before reading 'Sun...'."
4,A great love story,"One of Hemingway's better novels, features Lady Brett Ashley and a young bullfighter. I found it a little hard to follow at some points, but an overall good book"
4,A short vacation into Pamplona,"I enjoyed this book quite a lot. I found it to be short and simple with some great scenery and senses descricptions. But in the end it is more of a self analysis book through drinking and eating from France to Spain and back. I would have to say I preferred For Whom the Bell Tolls. It has more of my kind of necessary drama through the fight for survival. But, who could ever say that Hemingway isn't one of the most enjoyable writers if not the most challenging."
2,Ok Book,"I say that this novel was very boring.. A large Group of people used to gather almost everyday to sit around and just drink. People in the story were always concerned about their self. All they thought about was sex and how they needed it all of the time. I thought Jake, the main character and the narrator, shouldn't have had to go through what he went through; .He didn't deserve all that. Jake was an innocent man who just wanted on thing, and that was Brett.This novel is very similar to modern day times. Sometimes people engage in drinking just to get away from their everyday struggles.. The time in which this novel took place and now times are similar in ways. In both the characters in the novel and people now-a-days, turn to alcohol for relief and have tendencies to party all night long. Yet, there are parts in the book I cannot believe can occur, but this may be a good part of the novel; A place where dreams may happen."
3,Out of respect,"The MarginThe Sun Also Rises by Hemingway the second time around was a disappointment. The first reading, many years ago, was a disappointment too but I chalked that opinion up to immaturity on my part. What do I chalk it up to now? I don't know. Anyway, I have to say I'm not the least bit impressed. I'm going to press on though, hoping to grasp why the New York Times said, ""...a truly gripping story, told in lean, hard athletic prose...magnificent."" I went to the local library today and checked out The Old Man and the Sea.Marvin Wiebener, author of The Margin, a mystery novel of lost treasure with interesting characters and an unlikely outcome. You won't be disappointed."
3,Book review,"I expected better writing from him then this. There was too much detail describing uninteresting things such as paying for the bath house, step by description of walking down the street etc. Also was uneasy about the killing of the animals. Overall did not enjoy it. On a positive note it was an easy read."
2,Muddled,Not one of his best. I found the book very limited and not very interesting. The main character is constantly rejected by a rather flighty woman he is in love with although he is prepared to rescue her from various unsuitable liaisons.
3,Much ado about nothing,"This novel, more a novella, did not meet my expectations, especially being aware that Hemingway considered it his most accomplished book. There is too much dialogue, he is not ""at his best"" in his descrption of the fishing day in Basque country, or the Basque country, or the bull-fights. His novel comes off, as a character in A Moveable Feast told him of his Literature, too, skinny, too sinewy. Also, it is brutally anti-semitic."
3,Drunken Melodrama,"I think this is my fourth or fifth time to read this novel, and each time I read it I had an entirely different impression. In high school, the group of expatriates visiting Spain seemed glamorous and tragic, the dialog hard to follow.Now I see the book more as having historical significance. Hemingway captured ""The Lost Generation"" in these pages. His use of terse, journalistic prose was revolutionary. However, with age, the characters drunken escapades seem pathetic and juvenile rather that funny and glamorous. I feel certain this will be my last time to read it.... I'm too old for this crap."
2,If you haven't read Heminway before..pass over this one,"This novel, it has been written, was one of Hemingway's favorites. It certainly is not mine. I am listening to this book on tape and I am glad I didn't purchase the book. It is ok to listen to during rush hour traffic but not with precious evening hours. If you are into the late 90's politically correct scene, this book will offend you time and time again. I understand that in 1926 it was a different time, but Hemingway degrades Jews, Catholics, and I can't even use his derogatory word for the black fighter. Bull fights? Yeah, yeah, yeah, so what?"
2,Mystified,"This is the only book of Hemmingway's that I have read, and perhaps it's therefore unfair to characterize him by just one effort. However, I chose this because it seemed to be recognized as one of his best.Alas, for me, this book was nothing more than dead ordinary. If this is all that there is to Ernest Hemmingway, I am mystified as to why he has such fame. It's pretty pedestrian stuff, that (forgive me Hemmingway devotees) is really not worthy of notice. It is not awful, just awfully average. He makes no great mistakes, but also fails to do a single thing that would elevate him above the teeming ranks of authors out there. I slogged through it dutifully, waiting for the book to come alive, to show some wit, or intellect, or creative artistic expression, right down to the last page I was still waiting. And, I concluded - So! That's Ernest Hemmingway???Why does anyone care?"
3,"Eat, Drink, and Be Unhappy","Being a novel by Hemingway, I was optimistically expecting an enjoyable read. However, I found the subject matter of the text to be exhausting. The text repeatedly describes having meals, then wine, then more wine with ample whining. All of the main players exhibit self-pity and complete absence of self-esteem (whether it be externally and/or internally presented).If you read this, be prepared to be bored out of your wits. However, also be prepared to continue reading through until the end anticipating some climax. Although not necessarily ""enjoyable"", it is still an influential novel that is worth reading."
4,"A true classic, Written by a great author","The Sun Also Rises, was what shot Hemingway to the top! This book is one of the classics, and is a must read for everyone. It inspired the trend of ladies wearing their hair short, and acting free. I wholeheartedly give this book four stars."
1,READ REVIEWS.,"I needed the novel, The Sun Also Rises by E. Hemingway so I ordered it here. Unfortunately the book never came in the mail. I waited a whole month and still nothing (the book was suppose to be here in 5-19 days).Not satisfied with this at all."
3,Fails the Roger Ebert test,"I read this book because it was the monthly selection of my reading group. It was very well written, but I would not recommend it to my friends. Roger Ebert, the movie critic, sometimes says of a movie that, ultimately, he did not care about the characters. That is how I felt about this book. I just had no empathy for any of them. I could have stopped reading the book at any page and not felt that I had missed anything. In fact, the last 10 pages helped to explain the book, and so I am glad I did finish. But there are better novels out there. So many books, so little time."
2,o.k.,"the sun also rises is about a group of friends in the post world war 1 era.they go on a trip to pamplona,spain to watch the running of the bulls but buried feelings come out in the open.jake barnes and lady brett ashley are two friends which the story evolves around and whose lives change as a result of their trip to spain.a classic but not that enjoyable."
1,DO NOT READ THIS BOOK,"Unfortunately, this is one of the worst books I have read in my lifetime. In our English III Honors - American Literature class, this has been by far, the most boring book. Although there were other books that we teenage readers could not identify with, some of them have been quite enjoyable.This book is the exception. It is dull, nothing happens, the dialogue is confusing and always pointless. The spend a good part of the book talking about nothing. It's like watching Seinfield without anything funny.This book is so boring that the cliff notes are boring.DO NOT READ THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU HAVE TO FOR AN ASSIGNMENT. THIS IS ONE OF HEMINGWAY'S WORST WORKS. READ ""FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS"" INSTEAD!"
1,If you liked Sienfeld....,"but thought it was to funny, this book is for you.A book about nothing, that takes 200 plus pages to get there.If you chose to read it keep sharp objects out of reach, because youmay feel like poking your eyes out."
2,lifeless writing,"Only the tip of the iceberg is visible, everything significant is below the surface, it's what's *not* said that matters, etc...Ok, but if what's above the surface is rendered in such a tedious fashion, I fail to see the brilliance in it. For me, the words on the page have to have some life beyond just pointing to hidden meaning. I mean, can a book be considered great if the reading experience is so empty and it's only value is in the interpretation? I say no, no it cannot."
1,A dull story about alcoholics and their boorish behaviour.,"I do not care to read anything further about the ""lost generation"" if Hemingway's characters are typical. The dialogue (of which most of the book is written)is corny and the only charcters worth saving are the natives that are encountered in the Basque Region and Pamplona.Thankfully Hemingway wrote less than 200 pages. I kept hoping that the story would end with Lady Ashley, Jake Barnes, Robert Cohen, and the other ""ugly americans"" and arrogant Brits entering a detox center and becoming the initial success stories of AA."
2,The Sun?,"I thought this novel was quite boring. Let me give you the bottom line. A group of people drank at clubs to get away from their problems and all they thought about was sex. Everyone is this story is so concerned about themselves that it's sickening. All they think about is how they need to satisfy their sexual needs and to cope with that, they drank like every night. I thought Jake, the main character and the narrator, shouldn't have gone through all of this. He doens't deserve all this pain. He's an innocent man that just wants his ""crush"" Brett to return his love.This novel is somewhat similar to modern life now. People do drink to get away from their everyday troubles. But after reading this novel, you realize that love is not about sex. It's about true love."
3,Jake and Brett,"The Sun Also Rises was a pretty good book, but I personally think that Brett and Jake should have ended up together because they both were in love with each other. Brett pretty much just played with Jakes emotions and when he thought that he was going to get his way with her she just left him for another guy or asked him for help with some guy. She may have loved Jake but she had a stronger love for money. I think that if her lust for money weren't so strong they would have ended up together.Earnest Hemmingway in all his books portrays him himself and his life excursions. Jake Barnes is the character that is depicted as Hemmingway himself. Jakes wound in World War 1 makes it impossible to ever have physical love with anyone, and especially Brett, the one he truly wanted to love. Brett's tendency to run around with different men all the time drives him even further into depression and drinking. The drinking also shows Hemingway himself, because he was a drunk."
3,The Sun Also Whines,"It's Hemingway, so, of course, the prose is sparse and the sense of place is compelling. If only the characters had any redeeming social value! Perhaps it's the times we live in, but I couldn't help wishing that these people would just shut up, sober up, stop whining and get a job!"
2,Doesn't stand the test of time,"On my third attempt, I finally made it all the way through The Sun Also Rises. I forced myself to finish it, even though the plot never engaged my interest and the dialog is terribly dated and worn. I read it to see what make it a classic. To me, the book doesn't stand the test of time. To quickly paraphrase the story: We ate. We walked over there. We drank and ate. We walked over here. We argued. We watched a bullfight. We drank some more... If there is something ""important"" about this book I missed it. If you're a fan of clever dialog and would like something a bit more current, I'd recommend ""The City of Your Final Destination"" by Peter Cameron or ""The City of Thieves"" by David Benioff."
2,not as good as i expected.,"i had to read this book for school, and although it was good at times, i would never even think of reading it on my own. the first part was really boring and did not contribute anything to the whole book. about the second part, im a very patient person, but having the same thing happening over and over again without any action was really making the book longer and longer. seriously, every single day the characters did the same exact thing: drink, argue, drink, drink, and argue again. the only thing i liked about the book was the way hemingway wrote it. he really has beautiful and very poetical writing. im from spain, and i was really surprised at how exact his descriptions are of my country. though sometimes his descriptions were boring and lengthy, it was almost as if you were reading a photograph. i just think the story wasnt that great... my point is: why read the book? just come to spain!"
2,That's it?,"After reading ""The Paris Wife,"" I decided to read Hemingway's ""The Sun Also Rises."" I kept reading even though I found the dialog tedious and uninteresting. Surely there will be something coming ahead that has made this book a classic I thought. As it turned out, there was nothing ahead but more of the same. If this is one of Hemingway's better novels, I won't be reading any others! Don't waste your time on this one unless you want to read a bunch of empty dialog between shallow, selfish, and soulless individuals who don't learn anything but how to continue on their own destructive paths while inflicting harm on others. However no one dies or is severely injured, because that would be too memorable or interesting for this book."
2,Please remember that this is his first novel!,"Just a quick comment for all of you that think this novel deserves 5 stars. It does not! This is Hemingway's first novel and as such it shows a young developing artist attempting to find his voice and build his craft. Like many writers at this stage he does not fully make the grade. If you read say ""A Farewell to Arms"" immediately after this book you will be able to see a great leap forward in Hemingway's prose within just the first 20 pages (to say nothing of ""For Whom the Bell Tolls""). Please restrain from making a book that deserves a ""3"" at most into a 5. (By the way I have lived in Paris and been to the running of the bulls so this book was a treat for me on that level). Cheers!"
2,"A disappointing ""classic"" unworthy of its fame","This is one of those books that I always wanted to read, but somehow never did. That is, until just recently. I suppose I was caught up in the romance and adventure of a Hemingway yarn, but ""The Sun Also Rises"" just didn't cut it for me. What well-read reader with an interest in history could not be attracted to the group of post World War I expatriates living in Paris? If this book was any real indication of the life that Hemingway lived, I am afraid that the whole scene of getting drunk and watching bull fights just isn't for me. I found Hemingway's prose to be too simple, and the story line did not hold my interest."
1,"Listening to this ""Hurt"" me!","William Hurt cannot read. At all. The cadence, inflection, and emotion of Hurt's reading are inappropriate in almost every circumstance, and the accents he attempts are laughable. I pity the first-time audio listener who might mistakenly pick up this lamentable reading and be turned off audiobooks altogether. There should be a warning label, ""Danger, listening to William Hurt's reading of ""The Sun Also Rises"" is known to nauseate expectant listeners"".On the brighter side, I have listened to many other wonderful readings of Hemingway's works including ""True at First Light"" read by Brian Dennehy and ""A Farewell to Arms"" read by John Slattery. Do yourself a favor and listen to a different reader."
3,I'm a Hemingway fan...and I don't really like it,"For the life of me, I don't understand why this is considered a classic. I've thoroughly enjoyed every other Hemingway novel, but ""The Sun Also Rises"" bored me to tears.I get it; Jake is Hemingway. It's autobiographical. Brett (Lady Ashley) is the near-perfect woman, able to seduce any man. I get it. Jake is either a gelding or has been, in a way, castrated. I get it. This causes a ton of trouble. Once again, the point is clear.Bull fight, drinks, walking and talking, sexual tension, relationships, a possibly scuffle, eating, Spain...wash, rinse, repeat.On the other hand, the prose, the sentence structure, the choppiness, the story flows in classic Hemingway style. The dialogue keeps the book relatively short, and the characters are very well developed. Beautifully written.It's just a boring story is all."
2,The Second Star is Only Because it Wasn't Incomprehensible,"This book had absolutely no message. At best it was a decent-flowing autobiographical narrative of a buch of meaningless stuff that happened one summer. There is some symbolism, but no message to give it any meaning. It left me wondering what all the praise could possibly be about. It also left me completely dissapointed."
3,"It's okay, really hard to follow!","This was a pretty good book, First novel by Ernest Hemingway, but I just couldn't follow the plot like why Lady Ashely and the narrator could get married! why? I still don't know and I guess if you really can and like to figure out plots and can follow through...then I guess this is for you...but I don't GREATLY recommend it. My opinion...the way I see it."
3,Not even close to his best,"This book does an excellent job of portraying the ""Lost Generation,"" but what else? It is in no shape or form a lousy book, but by the same token it's not even close to deemed as a classic. It's a basic story with simple symbolism. If this book was written by ""Joe Shmoe"" and not Hemingway, it wouldn't be anywhere near as popular. I recommend ""For Whom the Bell Tolls."" This is a true classic..."
3,"Enjoyable, no masterpiece","Maybe I would have gotten more out of this in an English class, with some supplemental analysis of historical context and autobiographical reference. I'll assume this is a fairly accurate portrait of Europe between the wars and the dissipated doings of an expatriate leisure class. It vividly captures an endless party milieu in Paris and Spain at fiesta time. Beyond that, I didn't find it very rewarding in either plot or character development. A group of friends eat and drink and screw around, and seldom reveal any sincere or recognizably human feelings as they speak in dirt-simple declarative sentences to one another. The central relationship between Jake and Brett is intriguingly problematic (his impotence from a war wound is implied), but thinly realized. Overall, a fine evocation of a time and place, but otherwise pretty lightweight."
1,"Lost generation, aimless novel.","We have only one life to live, so we can find some subjects worth reading and thinking about. This lost generation that is depicted in this badly written book is not one of them. Think about unsung heroes from generations that survive lesser known genocides, and the people who galvanize a society after unspeakable destructions brought by ruthless revolutonaries, guerillas, and militias. There are far better books written by less-known authors about these ""lost generations"" that do not go about aimlessly drinking, binging, and partying but instead do something more noble and redeeming, even in small ways. If only Hemingway were not so famous, anyone can recognize that this book of his was written in such a mediocre way, and he unfortunately chose a sad and hopeless subject."
5,A story of loss,"Some people tend to expect too much or over-analyze the book. It is simply a story of loss and how we try to overcome it. Be it unrequited love, being socially unaccepted, lost in a foreign land, or even your generation. The book presents the questions and shows the struggles of finding meaning for our actions that Hemingway and all of us encounter. He doesn't try to answer any questions but its reassuring that we are not alone. Its beautifully staccoto style and troubled characters make this a true classic and a strong reccommendation to anyone feeling lost."
4,A story that could be told today,"The Sun Also Rises is a story chock full of rich and complex characters. Papa gives us a broad view of desires, heartache, apathy, alcohol, bullfights, and Spain and France from the view of British and American expatriates. The most brilliant aspect of this novel is that everyone has experienced some of the emotions, thoughts, and situations in this book. -Dana Epperson"
3,Hemigway is great... but not here.,"Hemingway is a fantastic writer, however his plotting leaves much to be desired in this story of an impotent (in more ways than one) man who drifts through life as though he has no purpose.I absolutely hate the end of the book, where Brett tells him that if he wasn't impotent ""we could've had a hell of a good time.""I do mark the book as 3 stars however, because Hemingway's use of language is so powerful. The plot is absolutely useless."
3,Worth reading? Perhaps....,"At best, I consider this book to be a typical of the post WWI authors- rather plotless, lost, simple story-telling. Very ""He said, she said"" kind of writing annoys me, although I am not denying that perhaps this novel is better than I think. If you have a couple of hours to waste, this will do nicely. C+."
5,My Favorite Hemingway novel,"This might actually be my favorite book as well. It typifies the ""Hemingway style"" of writine-- the infamous subject verb adverrb sentences and machismo. Brett Ashley, insecurities and all is probably his most interesting book for readers interested in a female character. It's definitely a quick read, very interesting and well constructed, especially for a first novel."
4,From a writer's point of view,"The Sun Also Rises was my first introduction to a Hemingway masterpiece and it has certainly changed my perceptions on ""writing"" and ""literary style"". At first, I wondered why he was going on and on about aimless lives, and by the end of the bullfight it was so clear that Hemingway was a literary genius. Word became character and character evolved into word. His narrative absolutely captured the lives of the lost generation after the war, and that is his genius. His ability to transcend the explanatory. Althought written almost 80 years ago, I felt transported to that time when life seemed aimless and yet profoundly full of optimism and hope."
3,Different,"Reading one of Hemmingway's first acclaimed novels, I felt the Sun Also Rises truly transported me to a different time and place. The simple narration was colourful and great, and the descriptions of the American and English friends frolicking through the cafes and restaurants left me stunk of wine, and merriment. Reading this book made my drunk just by all the booze they were consuming.Nevertheless, I didn't feel this novel take off until they arrived in Spain. Brett is a character that is for sure, but everyone else seems relegated to supporting parts. I kind of was hoping the story would tell a litte bit more about them.I did enjoy the book but only in places, and I also feel that the book seems a bit dated. But it's a good read no doubt. Yes I liked it."
3,Good condition,"The condition was excellent. Hemingway gave vivid descriptions of the spanish countryside. However, the description of the charcters was somewhat lacking."
5,Masterpiece,"The Sun Also Rises is a masterpiece of fiction. One of Hemingway's earlier works, it remains one of his best. The descriptive prose and the dialogue are unsurpassed."
5,The Sun Also Rises,"As the previous reviewer indicated, this is an excellent novel. Apparently however, Mr. Biswas is not entirely familiar with Hemingway. In 1926 Charles Scribner's Sons of New York published Hemingway's first novel, ""The Torrents of Spring."" Shortly after, in the same year, they also published his second novel ""The Sun Also Rises."" The following year (1927) the London firm of Jonathan Cape published this second novel in England under Hemingway's original title, ""Fiesta."" This reprint of that English edition is, in fact, subtitled ""The Sun Also Rises."" No matter what you call it, this is some of Hemingway's finest work."
5,brilliant,"I read this book for required summer reading, and after a somewhat difficult-to-follow book, this novel was a breath of fresh air. It said this novel was famous because of Hemingway's prose, and I agree. He does not dress up this story with unfathomable metaphors and whatnot. He tells it like it is, which is what I like. This is the ""Lost Generation"" - the people right after World War I, and everyone's pretty much...lost. Our characters capture that theme very well, with their decadence (heavy drinking) and meandering. The characters Lady Brett Ashley and Jake Barnes are memorable. They both love each other very much, but Jake is impotent due to a war injury, and this prevents Brett from committing to him. This is a poignant novel, and sometimes, I could relate to their issues (minus the heavy drinking!) very well."
4,Hemingway's Best But You're Better Off With Salter,"I've read the majority of Hemingway's books and this is the only one I return to. It has a great deal of atmosphere and always gives me a taste of what post-WWI life was like among a certain set of worldly adventurers. I feel like I'm along for the ride when Jake goes fishing or to the bullfights, and Hemingway makes me taste the cold beer Jake drinks in the heat of the day. At the end though, I feel a certain distaste for the maneater Brett and also Jake, because he's so taken with this ultimately shallow woman. Is this a great book: no, but ""isn't it pretty to think so."" It's just very good. I would recommend to anyone who likes Hemingway another American writer named James Salter who is celebrated but not nearly as much as Hemingway. For my money, Salter out-Hemingway's Hemingway."
3,..i don't get it,"the only reason i gave this book 3 stars is because Hemingway is an amazing author. However, I just could not grasp the point of this book. I had a very hard time keeping up with the dialogue as well as trying to figure out what the point of the book was! Although Hemingway's description of the character's personalities was vivid and very distinct, I couldn't understand how they all connected or why they were in Spain in the first place.Throughout the entire time I attempted to figure out this book, I kept thinking how much better I probably would have understood (and therefore, enjoyed) it if I had read this in an english class in either high school or college.after finishing the book, I read reviews on amazon, and although I was able to piece a few things together, I could not undertandd why so many people are giving this book such stellar reviews."
1,"Excellent book, Horrible Edition","Let me be clear: ""The Sun Also Rises"" is a wonderful book. I just wanted to write a note warning readers about buying this particular edition (published by thINKing - advertised above) of the book.Aside from the horrible graphics on the cover, inside there are numerous misspellings, typeset changes, odd paragraph indentations, and jumbled words. The whole package comes across as lazy, as if the printer cared so little for the text, they just threw together this edition.I would recommend any edition of ""The Sun Also Rises"" over this one. It is not worth your money."
5,A Brilliant Young Author's First Offering,"A young Ernest Hemingway writes his first novel. Full of the joy and sadness of youth, no one is better than Hemingway in evoking the sensual pleasures of the world. Lovely prose, wonderful energy... Hemingway in the first flush of his true talent. Not to be missed.Donald Gallinger is the author of The Master Planets"
1,ernest hemingway reminds me of lynard skynard,"well, I just finished speedreading this book. apparently Ernie liked to drink and drink and drink. I like that. but there are so many parts of this book where they are not drinking. those parts suck. the bull was pretty cool though. and a lot of drinking was going on. what is pernod though? is it like budweiser? this book reminds me a lot of lynard skynard because I get drunk listening to their records. did ernest hemingway ever hang out with lynard skynard? probably. but who knows. but I hate this book because of all the parts where they're not drinking. it just doesn't make any sense. if there would've been more drinking I would have loved this book. but it sucked."
1,Slooowww..........Readiiiing.,"This was our second book club pick and we could barely muddle through!We liked the descriptiveness, but the plot was slow and fairly uninteresting."
1,the sun also rises,"I have not recieved this item. It was supposed to be sent to the dead letter file but, is stll enroute to somewhere. It was supposed to be a surprise gift but of course that is not possible now. Please inform me as to what to do.Sincerely, Charles Howard"
3,Disappointing,"I was disappointed in ""The Sun Also Rises"". Perhaps my expectations were too high or, perhaps, this is simply not one of Hemingway's greatest works. Methinks the latter.The essence of the novel is the meanderings of a group of American expats living in France and travelling through there and Spain during the 1920s. They seem to spend a lot of time eating and drinking but not much else. They have been described as the lost generation. I would rather describe them as lost. Their eating and drinking seems interminable and the reader is left waiting for something to happen. And it doesn't.It pains me to write this review as there is so much to love about Hemingway. His Nobel Prize was warranted and his later works such as ""The Old Man and the Sea'', ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" and ""A Farewell to Arms"" are masterpieces. Unfortunately, ""The Sun Also Rises"" does not compare well to these other works. It's a shame, but avoid this work and your opinion of Hemingway will not be damaged."
3,"OK, but I expected more","Believe it or not, this is the first book in my 48 years I've ever read by this lionized author. And while it probably won't be my last Hemingway book, I hope his other works are more fulfilling than this. There are really no characters I cared about in this novel. It's just a bunch of drunken expatriates hanging out in Europe. I sure wish I could afford to do that. Nevertheless, it's sort of a time capsule of this period of time with this particular group of people. There is some heartbreak involved, but nothing much really seems to happen. For a 1920's period piece with much more depth and a much more compelling story, I would recommend ""The Great Gatsby"" by F. Scott Fitzgerald. ""The Sun Also Rises"" is not a total waste, so I'll give it a half-hearted recommendation just because it's Hemingway and does have a unique, lean style. I just don't think it's great. Chalk it up as a decent first effort."
2,Does not translate ?,"I wish I understood what all the fuss about Hemingway was, I have read the short stories, the old man in the sea and the sun also rises. I am yet to find anything appealing about Hemingway's writing. They almost seem to be written by a child, there is never a story being told, the characters are always underdeveloped and flat, the dialogue is mind numbing. They are just outright Boring..I read The Sun Also Rises about a month ago and I can hardly remember anything about it.Perhaps they relate to that generation only and do not carry over ?"
1,The Emperor Has No Clothes,"I've been looking forward to reading this novel for a long time, as Hemingway is considered one of the greatest American writers who ever lived. Sorry folks, but I can't believe this pile of garbage is considered an all time classic. If I wrote this and took it to a publisher he would have thrown it in the garbage after a few minutes. I can't believe so many people gave this meandering, meaningless piece of trash all the stellar reviews. I will never read another Hemingway...and I was looking forward to reading them all."
1,A classic author,"The review of this book should be one of great raving and wonderful words. Hemingway is a classic writer and revered by many and has earned his place in the literary world. For me, this book is very dry and drawn out. It is slow moving and the point of the story is hard to decipher.Jake Barnes is a writer and Lady Brett Ashley is wealthy and goes through her life drinking and with no purpose. The story describes their relationship and lives. The story did not hold my attention and was not one that caused me to stay up all night to finish reading.William Hurt is a good actor but as a reader his inflection did not work for me. I had a difficult time telling which character was which by voice alone.All in all, I am more interested in writers of mystery, crime and science fiction than I am in a classic author."
2,Not that good,"I had high hopes for this book being that it was from Hemingway and regarded so highly by so many people. But I just dont get it. The metaphors and whatnot are not lost on me. But they arent that profound. Not only does this book not really say anything as you're reading it, I mean nothing happens in this book, but the message that it is trying to deliver is not so hot either. I like to read books that say something profound about humanity. When I read a book I like for my thoughts to run wild with new ideas and understanding about mankind. This book was a chore and delivered none of this. I've read the positive reviews here, but this stuff that people point out just isnt that fun or interesting to read. The point that the book makes could be made in one chapter, or could be a side point to a more interesting tale. I give it two stars instead of one because I was able to finish it (although perhaps that was because I expected to eventually be rewarded and it wasnt that long)."
1,Agonizing,"I'm sorry. I love to read. I love classics. But I would have to be able to discuss this in class or a book club to enjoy it. Hemingway's style is absolutely aggravating unless you read it with an eye of appreciation for what it did to American literature. This is probably a great read within a group, but I hated it as I trudged through it on my own."
2,Overrated,"I've never read Hemmingway before and thought I would give this book a shot since it was his first novel. Can anyone say boring??? Hemmingway's use of run-on sentences and mindless detail describing insignificant things bored me to tears. It seems his characters basically spend their time drinking, drinking, and more drinking. I couldn't wait to finish it."
3,spain sounds vastly lovlier than hemmingway is capable of describing it.,"I thought the first 100 or so pages of this was incredibly tedious and flat, but it really opened up for me when they got to Spain. The descriptions of the severe, castillian country side are really lovely, and I could almost see Jake and co., hiking through the land, sipping wine, and just enjoying their drunken, gnomic conversations as they stumble and collide through their little expatriate lives. I don't really like Hemmingway or the way he writes, but I found this enjoyable. Not earth shattering, not revelatory, just enjoyable. I'd still rather work through a baroque 19th century novel, or some fractured, schizophrenic postmodern nightmare than sit down and read a chapter of his prose. If that makes me a snob, so be it."
2,Ok read - but there's better stuff out there...,"I suppose its bad form to say something negative about a classic like The Sun Also Rises, but to me the book clearly demonstrated the emptiness and futility of living a life without purpose. I think this book communicates a message about a generation of utterly lost individuals - searching for meaning and significance in the trivial stuff they do, but in the end living lives of despair without true happiness. Great book to read for that significant life lesson - and the fact that Hemingway writes so well."
1,Dry and Very Dull,"The book is about the protagonist Jake Barnes. It details his many days as an expat in Spain and France. The trouble is that there isn't much to his days except for drinks, breakfast, lunch, and more drinks. Jake and his friends, Robert, Mike, and Bill along with the loose Lady Brett Ashley get soused and dance at bars and argue and drink and vie for the attention of said loose Lady Brett Ashley. Mike is Ashley's current beau but Robert keeps trying to take her away while Jake(who says he's already been with Lady Ashley) is still secretly in love with her and suffers in silence.Throw in a bull fight or two along with a fist fight between Robert and Jake, an affair between the bullfighter, Pedro Romero and the loose Lady Brett Ashley and you have the entirety of the 251 page boring melodrama.If you are at all curious who the 34 year old loose Lady Brett Ashley chooses in the end, you'll have to suffer through reading the entire bunk like I did or skip to page 247."
5,"simplistic, wonderful","This is not a book that can be taken at its face value. In order for the reader to get a true feeling of what the story is about then they have to read beyond the simplistic form. Jake is constantly trying to re-assert his manhood. That is why he hated the men that Lady Ashley was with when she is first introduced into the story. They were gay, and he sees them as having the correct tools and using them the wrong way. The bull fights are the same, its all about penetration, either the bull does or the sword does. Nearly all of the characters are expatriates, and their incessent drinking illustrates their desolation and thinking that there is nothing good in the world anymore. A common thought after WWI. Hemingway spins an intricate tale of unrequited love and desolation beneath a simplistic facade. EXCELLENT"
4,Intriguing Novel,"This is the first Hemingway novel I have read.I both enjoyed it and found it puzzling. I disliked the characters yet also liked them. I enjoyed Hemingway's prose style. Some of the descriptions, the constant moving about from bar to bar, is rather a nuisance in a sense, yet also entirely necessary in that it serves to parallel the overall scheme of the novel.Well worth reading, even if just to admire Hemingway's style. Like another person pointed out, this reads much like an extended short story. The fishing trip is very nice; the best scene, which had me most into the book, was the when the boxer got a few punches in--!"
3,Did I miss something?,"The characters had depth and the writing was clear, but I think I missed a plot or storyline. It moved along well, but unless you find a story about a bunch of spoiled post-adolescents tromping around Europe in the 1920's particularly interesting this one may leave you a little hungry. I already own A Farewell to Arms and For Whom the Bell Tolls so sometime down the road I will give those a shot, but for now Hemingway has not impressed me. I'll take Steinbeck over Hemingway any given day."
1,An unfunny Friends episode w/good travelogue of Spain,"Several self-centered ugly Americans get drunk repeatedly in Parisian and Spanish locales. This novel maybe might have been 2 good short stories, one about fly fishing in Spain, one about the running of the bulls and the bullfight--those parts were lovely, but the characters and plot were boring and pointless, and worse, ugly. Perhaps the novel had more of a shock value in 1927 with the descriptions of promiscuity by an English lady and the drunkenness of the characters, but unfortunately all of our cities,d suburbs, TV sets and movies are filled with adolescents doing the same things. The later works and the Nick Adams stories are so much better than this. I was very disappointed."
2,Anomalous,"I have a great deal of respect for writers who can produce great literature composed of simple language. Hemingway has always been one of those authors who I've held up to others as an exemplar of such writing, and I was surprised to find such an ordinary piece of work in Fiesta. His charcterisation, which is usually so deeply and thoughtfully evoked by memoir and circumstance,is flat and unmotivated in Fiesta. The plot is weak, the drama shallow and the interpersonal relationships are at best puzzling.If this is your first encounter with Hemingway, don't give up - ""A Farewell to Arms"", ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" and ""The Old Man and the Sea"" are all magnificent, and EMH deserves his reputation as one of this century's greatest authors."
2,Hemingway? To Have or Have Not?,"So, yeah.. I read The Sun Also Rises.. twice. I even watched the movie. There is nothing interesting here. His prose plods along. His characters say 'extroadinary' things. They drink. They are 'just too much', they argue ..oh, well.No, I'll never get why people like Hemingway. What fascinates me about this book is how someone can take such interesting characters and paint them in such a dull manner. What can be done with this book? Do as Hemingway always said. Be practical, take a book like this and use it practically. Roll it up, ..wow! ..it's a small cricket bat or tennis racket! Yeah, maybe he'd like that!"
3,burp!,"After 30 odd years I reread this and it was a whole new book and a frighteningly realistic one. More so then when I read it as a young man. Now, it is a sad and pathetic story about a bunch of drunks where not a page goes by that they are not having a drink, going to get a drink, or leaving the place where they just finished a drink. Without intending to, but with an innate, brutal honesty, Hemmingway describes the shrinking lives and fates of alcoholics."
2,Hard to get into,"I had a difficult time getting into this book. It was not difficult to read and finish, but very difficult to have any feelings about or connections with the characters."
2,The Sun Also Rises,The Sun Also Rises is an okay book. At some points it was very interesting and at other times somewhat boring. The book also had its points where it was a little difficult to understand. If I had the choice to read the book again I doubt I would unless I was forced to. Even though the book wasn't terrible its not something that I would just pick up and read in my spare time.The book had its good points. The book had a lot to do with stuff that is going on today. That is one reason that I continued reading the book. If it wasn't for the many problems in the book I doubt I would have finished it. I also think it had I little too much going on because it reminded me of a soap opera.
4,"Good, but not great.","I enjoyed the story, particularly after having been to Paris last summer. The emphasis on drinking is interesting during the age of American prohibition. I found the writing style to be most interesting: concise and bordering on too concise. I do not think that Hemingway's reputation as a great writer was made with this book alone, but I do now want to read For Whom The Bell Tolls."
1,Worst crap I ever read and that's putting it mildly!,"I was so bored reading this book. After reading the grammatically incorrect sentences on the first page, I should have stopped. However, I was lulled by the great Hemingway name and continued onto the dull, dry book. It was so hard not editing his badly constructed sentences. They call this prose? Hah!!! No flow, no plot, not much in adventure and I could not wait to finish, just to see if anything was indeed worth the read. NOT! Don't waste your time and money. This book is worth starting a fire with or swatting a fly...that's all."
5,Great book,I really like this book! It is a good read and I enjoy the content. It was exactly what I was looking for! I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good book!!
2,Hard to Understand,"I read a lot. Many of them are classics that I thoroughly enjoy. I have even read Hemingway and loved it. I couldn't finish this book.Their is more dialogue than anything else. The dialogue gets very confusing and repetitive. It seems unreal. I don't see real people talking that way. Now, that might be because I don't hang out with people who spend their lives in foreign countries and party every day and night.That's something else. All they do is drink, flirt, eat, and go to another party. They also insult each other and then are best friends. Maybe after I go through and read some analysis and commentary on it, I might enjoy it better. But I shouldn't have to do all that to enjoy a book.There are some that find this book outstanding. Great! Read on. This just wasn't for someone likes to read for enjoyment."
2,Expats Party From Paris to Pamplona,"I have actually heard more than one person say that ""The Sun Also Rises"" is their favorite book. I have no idea why they would say that. Maybe I just didn't ""get it.""The novel revolves around five English-speaking expatriates who spend their time drinking and carousing their way from Paris to a festival in Pamplona. The four men in the group are all in love with the one woman to some extent. And the woman has affection of some type for each of the men.There is some humorous drunken dialogue from time to time. There are some good descriptions of bullfighting and trout fishing . Beyond that, there is not much to recommend ""The Sun Also Rises.""There is very little story to be told. The book reads like the travel journal of a lovesick person that has been translated from another language into English. Perhaps it just hasn't aged as well as some of Hemingway's other work. ""The Sun Also Rises"" was lost on me."
3,Not bad but not what I expected,"Ernest Hemingway. We've all heard about him. I never had cause to want to read any of his writing. My wife was assigned this with a college english course. I decided I'd read it. I checked out reviews here first. Most of them sounded as if they had copied and pasted a part of their own english course review here. What the instructor wanted to hear.Here's what I think. I enjoyed most of the book. The second half much better than the first. Was I blown away like I thought I would be? NO! Did I enjoy it enough to want to try some more, YES. Most of this book has the cast of characters bar hopping and talking, bad-mouthing, and generally treating each other like crap. That's the first half. The sceond half seems to slow down a little (not as much bar hoping/trash talking). More descriptive and more enjoyable, I thought. Enough to give the book a middle of the road review. I'm off now to try another Hemingway book. Probably ""For Whom the Bell Tolls""."
1,"I know it's a classic, but why?","I've head about this book all my life and know that it is a classic. But I've found it to be one of the more painful books to get into that I have attempted to read. I've tried and tried but finally given up...would love to know if its one of those books where you have to get to chapter 'x' before things start clicking. If so, please tell my what chapter that is!!! I wanted to read it, and wanted to love it as a great classic...haven't been able to do that yet."
2,"Hemingway good, story bad","I've often wondered how I got through college as an English major without reading any Hemingway. The classics have always been my favorites, and American lit specifically. So, as an adult, I've tried to add some of those critically acclaimed books I missed in undergrad to my ""Have Read"" list. The first Hemingway book I read post-college was A Farewell to Arms. I liked it ... not loved, but liked it enough to read more of his work. But this one ... I struggled through it. I felt like each page was the same -- group of friends who don't all like each other and lots and lots of alcohol. I did make it to the end despite my minimal interest in the story (or lack there of) because, no matter what the story is, Ernest Hemingway's style of writing is a great example of a true gift."
2,Not worth your time,"A boring book about the empty lives of empty people. It would have been more interesting if they were contrasted with some other type. The book my be historically important for the ground it broke at the time it was written, but today your reading time is better spent elsewhere."
1,terrible book,"I had to read this book for english, and I hated it. The book has no theme, except that narcissim is okay. If you are a narcissist, and enjoy drinking, this book is for you. Otherwise, stay away from it."
1,worst American writer,"Ernest Hemingway has made alcoholism into a fine art, because that is basically what all his novels are about. This was the first piece of work I read by him and I wish it had been the last. There was no plot, no meaning, no story and, ultimately no point. The characters were bland and unlikeable. I can sum up the content of the story:drunkenness, anger, hopelessness, drunkenness, depression, and more drunkenness."
1,Absolutely AWFUL,"I read this book for an English class, expecting it to be the masterpiece it's cracked up to be. I was unpleasantly surprised. This book is not only TERRIBLY written, it is boring beyond words. Hemingway's writing style could easily be surpassed by a seven year old. Descriptions like ""she was really pretty"" just don't cut it in the world of top writers."
3,My opinion on this one!,"My opinion on this book is that it was not bad but yet not what i expected it to be at all. This movie was basically about sex, violence, drinking, and many love affairs. Personally I would say that many people can relate to this book because it is exactly most people's lives today.Hemingway is an exceptional writer. I do like some of his work. This book was based on his life. All of his love affairs, how much he loved to drink and violence that he had gone through (the wars). It is interesting how a person could just sit down and write about his life for the world to read."
1,The worst book I've ever read.,The book was given to me by my teacher to review. We have to make a writen report about the novel by ernest hemmingway. The story is about the group of young americans is living in Paris in the years after the world war I. Before the war they might have become professionalsbut the experience of so much death and destruction undermined their belief in traditional american values.The story has a good theme but the story could have been writen in a better way. I would never read this book again. If it weren't for my teacher i wouldn't read it.
2,Expected Better from Hemingway,"Not such a great book. Boring, characters not well developed. Plot not so great. I expected much more from Hemingway. Much better book by Hemingway is, ""For Whom the Bell Tolls""."
2,I'll just wait till the Sun Rises,"My apologies to all the Hemingway fans, but I didn't really care for this book. I had a hard time understand what was going on throughout the book. One bright spot was when they were in the mountains fishing and it is always nice to read of another country that is not yours. The characters did not appeal to me, I wouldn't want to party with any of them. They seemed lost and spoiled. Grabbing a quick peek at the Cliff Notes in a book store for this book; I found some of my conclusions were valid. But unfortunately it just wasn't for me. If you try this book I wish you luck."
3,Steve Morse has some FAST fingers!,"Most of the songs on ""Night of..."" are pretty predictable, about what you'd expect if you are familiar with the Dregs of this era (mid 70s, if my memory serves me). But ""The Bash,"" aka ""Wabash Cannonball,"" recorded live at the Montreaux Pop Festival, is guaranteed to blow your mind! I have NEVER, before or since, heard such fast, precise guitar pickin'!! Especially considering it is a live recording! It blew my gourd right off the first time I listened to it, and still does, 20+ years later. Guys who can pick strings fast are a dime a dozen. But you will listen to ""The Bash,"" and shake your head in astonishment! This CD is worth the $, just for that one song, in my opinion."
3,All 1964 Vee-Jays - no stereo,"For Little Richard fans who have already heard the '50s originals and would like to hear some (not all) interesting remakes from the next decade. ""Tutti"", ""Molly"", and ""Jenny"" emerge unscathed. ""Keep A-Knockin' also works, in a very different approach. An explosive, successful meeting of the non-secular with the secular, as the presumptive studio band works out a very credible rendition.Some remakes are those of contemporaries like Lloyd Price (a mindblowing super LR showcase on ""Lawdy, Miss Clawdy""), Drifters/Clyde McPhatter (a frenzied ""Money Honey""), Fats Domino (an uptempo jazz-rock take on ""Blueberry Hill""), Larry Williams (a low-fidelity but exciting ""Short Fat Fanny""), and a rockin', piano-driven delight from Harry Nillson (he's the co-writer of ""Groovy Little Suzy"").Well, a LR fan could actually start with these (but should follow-up with the Specialty label originals!)."
3,An interesting book ...,"Collusion was extremely well written and easy to read. It kept my interest from the first sentance to the last word.However, the content was somewhat questionable. It was a wonderful and interesting showing of the life of a serious dancer, yet seemed SO obsessed with violence, sex and eroticism.Interesting, but not really worth the time."
1,This woman is sick.,"I'm sorry. I tried to read this book but couldn't. I was so disgusted. Violence is glorified as a vehicle for perverse sexuality, albeit imagined. I certainly hope that the wretched instructor would be as horrified as I was at this incestuous breach of the ""in loco parentis"" status once held by all teachers."
1,run far! run fast!,"This book is a tale spun of nothing. Nothing really happens here, and it's obvious that we're dealing with an obsessive teenager's crush. Did they have sex? No. Did anything really happen? No. WHy is she so obsessed with it years later? WHy did this get published?"
2,buy a night splint instead,It feels good to stretch the plantar muscle...this didn't help me feel better. the night splint finally helped
4,Just A Dream,Chris Van Allsburg has done it again. This book helps kids get a better understanding of why being a litterbug isn't cool. His illustrations are awesome. I wanted to be able to be in the pictures with Walter (the main character). Everybody that litters should read this book. Our world would be a more beautiful place.
1,Not consitent with the morals I want to pass to my children...,"This book is a pretty extreme children's story that follows the new religion of environmentalism. Very anti-technology and anti- progress... no lawn mowers, no electric dryers? We received this as a gift and I will not be keeping it. I wouldn't read this book to my children."
5,Just A Dream,"Our fouth grade class just read [ Just A Dream ]and I think it's a really great book and I think the pictures are fabulous.I think Chris Van Allsburg is trying to persuade us to keep our country clean, so in the future it will look like that picture at the end of the book."
2,Just a Disappointment,"I love Van Allsburg's books, mainly because I love his illustrations. However, I have two problems with this book. First, the layout was a little strange. It's kind of difficult to read a story to someone when the illustration is on a totally different page from the words. Secondly, while I think it is important for most children's books to teach something and have some sort of message this story felt more like propaganda. I just think the message of saving the Earth could have been delivered in a much better way. I'll let you know when I discover a book that deals with this issue in that ""better way."""
5,great book,the product came on time and in the condition listed (brand new). This is a great book! As a teacher it is a must have in the classroom.
4,why we act in certain ways,"Freud presents examples and case studies of why we forget, make verbal slips. Explanation of negative assocaiations which result in suibconscious 'forgetting' is explained. This book is written in laymen terms. Parts of the discussions are sometimes tedious and I lost interest at times."
3,It doesn't really catch me,"I know this writer is a genius but this book doesn't really get my attention. I find myself reading pages over again because I forget what the page was about. Just not for me, not a book that I can't put down. I need a dictionary to read this book lol."
4,"surprise, surprise...","I had heard about this film via ""afterdark horrorfest"", and my expectations were not too high, not too low, i was interested though, enough to purchase the dvd. And boy was I surprised at how good this film was...i mean, its horror, blood, gore, and all that, so you know to a degree what you are getting, but this film has a lot of surprises in store for you, along with high production value, great artistic design, very good cinematography and a story that keeps you INVOLVED...i won't say any more except that this is a film that will surprise you..."
2,The only curse is trying to figure out this movie...,"To put it charitably, Voices' screenplay is a mess. Penned by five scribes including the director, Lee Shin-ae, who previously wrote Fox Stairs, and Lee Hyo-chul, responsible for Hanbando, it is a dreadful mishmash of different agendas and styles, without any coherent sense of what it's groping for.And if you were hoping for more backstory on the ""Family Curse"" the movie teasers warn you about, forget about it: that theory got thrown away faster than Ka-In's unlucky aunt on her wedding day."
5,One of the best books I have read this year.,"In a word: Brilliant! In three words: I enjoyed it. I started the book as bed-time reading, but found (to my wife's disgust) that it was keeping me awake at night. In the end, I had to devote a Saturday morning to finishing the book for domestic harmony.If your idea of a good read is a slam-bang space opera with cardboard characters, this is not the book for you. But if you like your books to be thoughtful and thought-provoking, with excellent characterization, then this is the one.Bova's strength is his ability to really make the characters in his books come to life. The scientists in the novel were just like some of my friends, struggling with the issue of how do you get someone to pay for your hobby and indignant that someone might actually want to make a profit from it. The mystery and tension built throughout the novel, making it harder and harder to put down. It was great.I am looking forward to reading Bova's next novel."
4,This book is good,"I feel compelled to write a review of this book because I wrote such a negative review about Bova's earlier book, MARS. RETURN TO MARS is much better. It is a better story with more realistic characters, and there is more action. Unlike the first book, I felt like they really did something on Mars, and what they discover is credible. There were less of the racist overtones and more the incorporation of heritage and the value of diversity. Now I understand why people like Bova. This was a good book, well-paced, not too psychological, not too sci-tech, just right. I was sorry to see it end. (And I did not miss the characters from the earlier book that were left out. I only wondered about them for the first 50 pages, then the new story took hold. Fewer is better in this case.)"
3,PC SF,"The science in ""Return to Mars"" was excellent, but I'm sick of PC characters. Of course, the white guy with the rich daddy is an evil capitalist and every other ""colored"" person is noble or sincere.Give me a break.What's wrong with private enterprise?"
5,When is the sequel comming out?,"I bought this book at 9.30pm, started reading it at 10.00pm and didn't put it down till I had finished it at 3.00am in the morning. The next day I started to read it again. When is the sequel comming out. I want to know what happens to Jamie and VJ in the 4 months on Mars, will they stay or go back to earth (hope they stay). Mr. Bova it is time for another book, make it snappy."
4,"Riviting read.....very ""Red"" perspective","""Red Perspective"" meaning from that of one who belives that Mars should be kept in it's pristine condition, untouched by man(except for a select few scientists) for all time to protect whatever life mayor may not be there.However, although I personally disagree with that perspective, I found this to be a riviting book which I couldn't put down. Yet another mission to mars, and Jamie finally gets to see if his cliff dwelling is just a figment of his imagination, or ruins left by ancient martians, long dead. This mission is also fraught with accidents, which one of the crew belives is a sabouteur. Almost unthinkable in the close-knit group of scientists.Mars is the next frontier to be explored, mapped, and colonised(I hope) in this century. Until we get there, reading an excellent account such as this, and others give food for thought of what to do once we get there."
2,Mediocre.,"This is the sequel to Bova's ""Mars"" novel, which was a more-than-tolerable read. This novel was barely worth finishing. Essentially, Bova is plumping against the notion that those awful Earth capitalists might exploit Mars by wanting to go there. The politics in the first novel were asinine, in this one just plain wierd. Somehow Bova has an American Indian tribe claiming the rights to most of Mars, thereby keeping the great unwashed capitalist masses away from Mars. Yeah, like that's going to happen.Bova's Left-wing political slant is worse in this novel than it was in ""Mars."" It gets worse, by the way, in ""Venus"" which I was unable to finish, and therefore have not reviewed.I gave this book 2 stars because I was able to finish it. Not recommended though. RJB."
5,Bova's best to date,"This book is a superstar effort for Bova. Unlike some of Bova's other books, Return to Mars' ending does not dissapoint. It will leave you with a sense of awe."
4,Ben Bova awakens Mars again!,"Well I first read Mars about two years ago, and when a few weeks ago I came across the sequel....well I had to find out what happened to Jamie. This is a great sequel to an book that re-invented the Mars sci-fi fascination. I don't really expect another sequel to this book although if it did come out it would be very interesting to find out what happens to Jamie and the sultress VJ!"
5,Return to Mars is an excellent sequel,"Ben Bova has done it again. He has written a novel that is believable, exciting, and with uses technology that is not too far removed from where we are now. Return to Mars is a great mix of science, politics, and the ambition of man. You care about the characters, you believe the technology. It reminds me of the film 2001, I can see Mars and Return to Mars being made as movies."
3,A nice chance to let the mind fly,"I read the first book on my vacation. I got really hungry. I was thrilled about the possibilities the ancient willage could offer. All the time I read this second book, I waited for what Jamie and the others would find once the cliff dwellings were explored. It left me a litttle short. I am no autor, but it would have been extremly exiting if the book had had an ending that had pointed to a third book in the series. One illogical detail was the easiness with which Dex and Possum found the mars path finder. On their way there their rower was almost covered with dust after a single dust storm, but the pathfinder itself - after all these years -was not covered with any dust at all. Nevertheless I had a few very exiting moments reading the book. And I really hope that Mr Bova comes out with a third book where there would be a link of somekind between our sivilization and that of Mars. Any commnts gladly taken! karilatvala@hotmail.com."
4,"If you liked ""Mars"" then you will also enjoy this sequel.",I really liked the novel and it was difficult for me to put down. The technology is not so advance from what we have today so the story seems all the more believable. It is easy to really get into the story and sort of feel how it would be to be there on Mars in the not too distant future.I very much very much recommend this book.
3,Simply Repetition,"I enjoyed Mars by ben Bova and was eager to read the sequel to learn the secrets that planet Mars has to offer humanity. I was disappointed to find that this book is merely a repeat of Mars with a different cast of characters.Jamie Waterman, the geologist from the first mission to Mars, heads up the second team to see if Mars can be lucrative for business. As in the previous novel, Jamie has problems with male team members and hits the sack with a female team member. It seems tha Mr. Bova hit on a good thing and simply stuck with it.The highlight of this book was discovering that the cliff dwellings that Jamie thought he saw in the first book were real. The decsriptions of the cliff dwellings were wonderful and make you imagine that there was life on Mars at one time in history. What a scary concept."
5,A book which matches and then outdoes it's pre-decessor.,"Having read and enjoyed ""Mars"" on it's release, I picked up a copy of ""Return To Mars"" hoping the sequel could sustain the quality of the original. A chapter into the book I knew that Ben had done it again and I was once again immersed in a martian landscape so beautifully described that you will believe humans have walked on it's surface. It could be read as a stand alone novel but,to gain the most from this marvellously entertaining read, you should read ""Mars"" first. Let's hope Dr Bova has another Mars novel on the way, his work is always worth reading."
1,BIG DEAL...IT AIN'T NOTHING. Nothing at all.,"Heck, it wasn't until page 291 that they, Jamie and Dex, finally checked out the ruins, which is what I was waiting for! What a boring boring book. My first Ben Bova, my LAST. The reviewer from Atlanta, GA has it right "" melange of superficiality and blandness""."
2,A flawed tale of interplanetary exploration.,"Return to Mars is a tale of interplanetary exploration which is flawed by stereotypical charectors (the evil businessman, the ""spiritual"" American Indian, the man-child who hates his father) and a politicaly correct message. The message, which Bova beats the reader over the head with the subtalty of a sledgehammer, interfeers with what otherwise is an exciting story of exploration rich with scientific and technical detail. Those space enthusiasts who dream of Mars as a new home for human kind will likely take exception to Bova's anticapitalist, antihuman tone and the message that Mars must become a science reserve, closed to human settlement and development. Because of this controversial view, Return to Mars if nothing else might stirr heated debate on what shape space exploration should take in the coming century.--Mark R. Whittington (...)"
2,No Text Reading,I did not realize that some ebooks had the text reading diabled if I had know this and was at a computer at the time I would have returned both the books.
5,In one word: Amazing,This album is so awesome! I received in from Amazon three days ago and have been listening to it nonstop. It's beautiful!
4,An account of the loss of 'the true' in the West,"In a very brief work , the author lays down an account of the ontological cause of liberal evasion so often evident in current western thought,political institutions and actions. The basis of value is ontology (the fact) and teleology (the source of value) which flows from that fact. The author manages to do elucidate the loss of grounding in being and Gods' Being from a historical perspective. God bless his cotton socks!"
5,A Perfect Birthday,I was invited to a birthday party and we did this mystery there. I was assigned the part of Koushpa Tater. I loved dressing up for my charecter. Everyone had a such a great time. It made me want to do a teen mystery for my birthday. One of the best things about this mystery is that your charecter turns out to be pretty different than what your invitation says. I think the company should make more mysteries like this.
2,it's just not that good,"There's good and bad aspects to this game that potential buyers really ought to know. To start with the bad news, the game is not durable at all. Once the solution is worked out it cannot be played again by any of the same players. One thing you should make sure of then is that none of your potential guests have played this before (you might want to do this even before you buy the game).Another weakness is the plot, which is what you are trying to put together to find the bad guy/girl. There are way too many red herrings, over too many hours, to try to deduce the culprit. The actual chain of events is very obscure and the clues don't clearly illuminate it. This means that however much fun you and your friends have in playing the characters at the end it's a dissatisfying experience in terms of solving a mystery.Overall I'd say it's a good way to have some fun if you just want a laugh and don't care too much about the outcome or how you got there."
4,freddie,"I keep hearing from Eric Clapton and many others that Freddie King is this hot blues guitar player. Well, I have been picking up his records inexpensively as I find them.I must be buying the wrong albums--later ones--because like Buglar, the Freddie King I have found is more rock inflected funk R&B.;But I have said the wrong word when I said ""wrong"" Freddie King albums, because from what I hear, these will do just fine.This album is funky, creamy blues funk, played by a master musician with a master backing band. I love King's ability to form potent leads out of a few notes. Like any King bluesman or great guitar player, Freddie has an amazing talent for taking a small pattern, and just ringing the hell out of it. Minimum playing, but maximum emotion.His voice is just amazing. Pure blues and soul.If I knew Freddie like others know Freddie. Well, with albums like this, beleive me, it won't be too long."
3,There was better Freddie,"I've been a Freddie King fan for a long time. Although most of this was good, it wasn't his best work."
4,"one foot in texas, the other's in nawlins","great funky blues from the master. sounds like allen toussaint had a hand in it. has aged well, highly recommended !!"
3,MIDDLE OF THE ROAD FREDDIE KING,"FREDDIE KING WAS AN AMAZING GUITAR PLAYER AND HAD A LIGHT, BREEZY STYLE OF SINGING THAT COULD PACK A LOT OF PUNCH, TOO. HE HAD TWO PHASES TO HIS CAREER: HIS ORIGINAL STUFF RECORDED IN THE EARLY 60'S ON THE KING LABEL, AND HIS LATER PHASE OF HIS CAREER, MOST OF WHICH HAS BEEN CAPTURED ON VINYL ON LEON RUSSELL'S SHELTER RECORDS LABEL. THIS CD FALLS SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN THOSE TWO PHASES. THIS ALBUM WAS ON THE POLYDOR LABEL AND WAS PRODUCED BY ERIC CLAPTON, WHO IDOLIZED FREDDIE (I GOT TO SEE THEM PERFORM TOGETHER ON TOUR AT ROOSEVELT STADIUM IN NEW JERSEY IN 1975 OR 1976). THIS IS A GOOD ALBUM BUT NOT A GREAT ONE, ANYTHING ON THE KING OR SHELTER LABELS IS MUCH BETTER THAN THIS. IF YOU WANT TO HEAR SOME FREDDIE KING BUT NOT ANY OF HIS SEMINAL RECORDINGS, I GUESS YOU WILL ENJOY THIS CD, BUT IT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT TOO MIDDLE-OF-THE-ROAD FOR ME."
3,"I bought it from Amazon.com, it is pretty good","I bought this cd on Amazon b/c it is hard to find, and it came pretty quick, like maybe 4 days max. I was only looking for Meregue con Opera and I like most of the songs, although a bit old, it is still danceable, and good merengue!"
5,Must Read!,"If you are seriously pursuing a relationship with God then this book, along with any other A.W. Tozer book out there, is what you need to read."
5,Ranks with the best!,He is one of my favorite writers. I have read most of his books. He has one of the best grasp of Bible doctrine and his life experience gives the most practical application. The Dwelling Place of God is no different. His writings I believe are among the greats with men like Charles H Spurgeon and more recently Charles Swindoll
5,Fantastic,"This would be a great book to give an unbeliever. As a Seasoned saint, I learned a lot as well. It is so deep and reveals deep understanding of Faith."
3,not his best stuff,"This is the first Tozer I've read in quite a few years, but I remember him as being insightful and thought-provoking. These short articles are still insightful, but some of them seem a little simplistic. Most of his solutions boil down to ""work harder"", without challenging the reader to examine his underlying attitudes which are the root of the problems he's describing."
4,An honest man of God.,A.W. Tozer is one of the best writers of Christian books of the 20th century. I read anything he writes. He's very knowledgable of Christ and his teachings. He truly is a Biblical scholar.
3,Almost - but not quite,"Meryrle Secrest's previous book, ""Stephen Sondheim: A Life"" was fantastic; every word was perfectly placed, every nuance was properly shaded (much like Sondheim himself). Unfortunately, this biography of one of the most complex and dissonant men to come out of the American Musical Theatre, Richard Rodgers, loses steam almost halfway through the narrative. It's as if the author lost interest in her subject between ""Carousel"" and ""The King and I.""To give Secrest proper credit, her chapters concerning Rodgers' collaboration with the tempestuous Larry Hart are truly engrossing and very lively. However, the Hammerstein and Post-Hammerstein years seem to be written in haste, or with no care at all.This book should be read by all devotees of the stage musical, just for its chapters on Rodgers and Hart. Otherwise, I strongly encourage that you read Ethan Mordden's book ""Rodgers and Hammerstein"" for a better view of the latter collaboration."
2,As cold as its subject,"An oddly cold biography. The author apparently has no particular love for her subject, his music, or for the musical theatre. She describes all three dispassionately, most likely getting her facts right and offering us occasional quotes from people who knew Rodgers. But the book itself never catches fire. I stayed with it to the end because I'm interested in the subject and not horrified by the fact that he may have been rather cold. But the book itself left me cold, which was a disappointment."
3,a tell all for sure,Rather far cry from Dorothy Rodgers books of life together. I totally enjoyed her decorating books that had a few great ideas but this is about a man not very nice who wrote very good music.
1,Dull and Recycled,"This is a very dull biography of a man who has yet to receive a good one. It's full of familiar stories and no new insights. The character of Rodgers himself never once comes alive; he remains a cypher. If you know anything at all about the history of musical theater, this is all very familier. Even the title is dull, drawn from Rodgers own clumsy lyrics for ""No Strings"". I could very easily put this book down, and in fact I did and never picked it up again."
2,"Disappointing with a capital ""D""","I'm in a good mood today, and feeling generous -- hence the two stars. Secrest learned that Rodgers could be a rotten person, that he drank and was a womanizer. She then proceeds to beat us over the head with it at great length. I didn't count the words, but it seemed like she spent more time on that then she did on Rodgers and Hammerstein -- not to mention the post-Hammerstein years. We learn nothing about how these shows came about and what happened to them beyond the most cursory; it's if her research there was limited to the notes on the cast albums. I've kept most of my theater books, except for this one. It went to the used book store."
1,Oh no no no no no no!,"Beg to differ, but this was one of the most unintentionally insulting Musicals ever written.While the story of two sets of twins separated at birth is clever (the plot is as clever as any from the ""Arabian Nights:"" Naturally, it would be, seeing how it was based on Shakespeare's ""Comedy of Errors""), the lyrics are juvenile and very politically incorrect, while the music is mostly forgettable.Songs like ""Opec Maiden"" and especially ""Revolution"" will have you hoping that no one else knows you're listening to this insensitive material. Even the names of the characters will have you cringing: ""Fatatatatatima?"" ""Ayatollah?"" Even the show's tagline is odd: "". . . . Musical Comedy Breaks Out in the Middle East!""By the way, this show closed after three performances. The critics were right about this one.But I'll bet the ""camel"" in the show (played by Steve Warner) was pretty amusing . . ."
3,Not So Wonderful If You Give It Some Thought,"Sure, we all enjoy a story where love helps a person or family overcome seemingly insurmountable odds. But that's just the problem with this film. It only touches the surface of the actual issues surrounding the advancement of medical technology and the preservation of life at all costs. Anyone with common sense knows that a baby born at 25 weeks is most likely going to face a lifetime of serious medical consequences. We don't really need to be told that. But I am not inspired by a story where the baby ends up with vision loss, hearing loss, inability to digest food, a shattered nervous system, and probable Intellectual handicaps. Yes, he's adorable. But what will be his quality of life in 10, 20, 30 years down the road?The mother's mantra to this child is ""Breathe and eat."". That's not life. Sorry, but it's not. And that's the problem when documentaries are more emotion than fact."
1,Waste of money,Batteries will not keep unit turning. No bearings on fan...must be just plastic shaft to plastic cut out hole.Will try to return. Do not waste your money on this.
3,Just what you would expect,"Pretty simple. The fan blows a small amount of air around the fridge to keep the temperature consistant. I use it in my RV fridge (4 cu ft). The bag of charcoal i.e. odor filter is lame. The bag gets caught in the cover when you try to snap it on.Biggest problem I'v had is when the fridge is full, air doesn't circulate any way. I expect this is helping a little, but is no big difference in the way the fridge works.No off switch, so you have to remove the cover to stop the fan between trips."
2,Breaks easily,I had this unit for about 2 months. Works fairly well. The tabs on the bottom of the unit broke after a month. I used tape for awhile and then gave up on it. Try the: Valterra A10-2606 FridgeCool 11.28 mA Fan with On/Off Switch. I've had it for five years without any problem. The Valterra is much easier on batteries too.
2,Very Silent,No on/off switch so it is always running as soon as you put the batteries in and the battery compartment cover is rather cheap and it not the easiest thing to remove without breaking it.I bought this in an attempt to make my RV fridge work better. This helped a bit but the whole fridge was defective and replaced. I am now using it in the new fridge but the problem is finding an unobstructed place to allow the air to flow. An RV fridge is already small so this takes up room too. I might use some velcro to mount it to the top.
4,No off switch,This does the job in our camper fridge. The only problem is there is no off switch. You have to take the batteries out ever tiome you want to turn it off. I added my own off switch to it.
2,Too noisy,"The one I received has a surprisingly loud motor noise, almost like something is flailing about internally.I'll let it run a while to see if it quietens down. Since it is glued together I can't open it up to see if I can quieten it.Not a good substitute for the other style I've had for 20+ years, the blue cube shaped one."
4,Hollywood truckbed bicycle rack,"Bought this rack after seeing my buddy's Hollywood rack.Sturdy unit and easy to install. Mine arrived from UPS with one end of the box open and the metal bar resting on the cement (great job UPS). Anyway, I sent it back and got a different style that mounts directly onto the Utili-Track of my Nissan Pathfinder. My friend still likes his though and recommends it."
1,stories of a few,was not at all what I was looking for-I wanted pictures of dolls-there were very few here.It was mainly a story of the sisters and how they got rolling on their business.Not Doll making
1,"odd, misleading book","I obtained this book partly because of the glowing Amazon.com reviews, but instead of a definitive doll book, I found a quirky self-published book, heavy on the text and with a definite Christian in-crowd bias. (""Garrison Oaks Publishing"" publishes books only by these family authors.) The art doll on the cover quickly gives way to Baby Think It Over dolls (to discourage teen pregnancy) and dolls based on the ""Elsie Dinsmore"" books by Martha Finley, which were designed to ""strengthen Martha Finley's Biblical hold on the development of tomorrow's leaders."" There are some interesting chapters devoted to specific doll companies, typically ""godly"" ones. This is fine if that's what you want, but I get the sense that the authors have gone to some lengths to market this book as a general doll guide, when it is anything but."
2,2nd Edition,"I would've rated this a 4 star or even a 5 if it had more than a few selected exercises answered in the back. Relatively easy to understand book but as far as self studying ... meh! Kind of an annoyance not having feedback that you REALLY understand the content. The kind of feedback you get from doing exercises and verifying your answers are right WITH AN ANSWERKEY! A FULL ANSWERKEY! Otherwise I'll just have to assume I'm right in all my answers and I know that can't be. Upside to this book (there are many) is that you will think you're the smartest person alive. But seriously if you don't want to passively learn math proofs I would go for a book that at least gives answers somewhere to assure you actually understand what you're reading. I say ""passively learn"" because while it does have the right amount of exercises, you could be getting them all wrong."
5,Amazing!,"If you want to lear to prove mathematical theorems and propositions, this is a most. I personally found it useful since I am an economist and all I ever wanted to know about the mathematical reasoning and proof skills I learned it here."
2,Fountain Pump,"It did last three years, but for the past few years I would often need to 'help' it to get it working.This fountain is in a location not seen very often and I'm sure that running out of water contributed to the problems.It finally quit for good and have now replaced it with the Beckett M130 (with auto shut-off) from Amazon.[...]"
1,Too fragile,"The pump arrived with a broken flow control cover. The supplier sent a replacement, but it is already broken again. Also, the water inlet is too small and is easily clogged, requiring almost daily cleaning. I do not recommend this pump if you are using it in an outdoor setting."
4,Blissful,"With their fourth release ...It Falls Apart, California's For Stars expand upon the moody melodicism of We Are All Beautiful People. Main architect Carlos Foster has been honing his songwriting chops over the last decade to achieve a compelling cross between Death Cab for Cutie and experimental Radiohead. Those are jumping off points only - For Stars have been slogging it out in the underground as long as their more successful counterparts. ...It Falls Apart, their breakthrough, hangs together like a vaunted concept album, the ""it"" of the title being love, of course. Eight songs in a short 37 minutes, it starts with a self-recrimination (""I Should Have Told You"") and ends, full circle, with rejuvenation (""Lend Out Your Love""). Foster has an aching voice used to great effect with the plaintive lament of ""friends, again"" on ""Calm Down, Baby"". And ""If It Falls Apart"" is an epic suite that folds ten years of indie rock into ten minutes of alterna-bliss."
4,Good Starter Album,"It's a little intimidating since I have read a professional critic's review of this cd as being a ""disgrace to his memory"" (Evans). Obviously the man was deep into the superb artistry and reflective stylings of Bill Evans so many of which are now released as digital remasterings. However, one has to start somewhere and this particular cd (one of a series by various artists on Verve) serves a distinct need for the jazz fan......you and I. As such this was my low budget introduction, used, at that, eight years ago.I still play this and find it a good compilation of Evans with such artists as Jim Hall, Eddie Gomez, Jack DeJohnette, Shelly Manne and the orchestral accompanyment under the direction of Claus Ogerman. Also included are three cuts from ""Conversations With Myself"". All twelve selections range from 1962 thru 1968.If you are wondering about the music of Bill Evans and his style of piano, this may be a good place to start.....it was for me!"
5,Masterful,"Worth it for Granados alone. I am a simple listener, no Bill Evans expert. I do have a decent size jazz collection and have discovered that some purists are aghast at the use of strings and orchestration on some jazz tracks. The Parker with Strings recordings come to mind. Anyway, it appears that the artists were interested in exploring the use of strings in their performance, so it is safe to say that THE ARTIST was proud of the tracks with strings. Evans was a monster and you do not want to limit your listening to these tracks. But the strings tracks are hauntingly beautiful."
2,Get Moon Beams Instead: Ruined by poor selection of tracks,"Don't get me wrong, I worship Bill Evans, but there are much, much better recordings of his material that do not require hitting the skip button. Tracks 3 and 11 have orchestration which I find completely obnoxious and unlistenable. I also don't care that much for several tracks where multiple pianos are overdubbed. I prefer his straight ahead original recordings with the various trios he played with in the late 1950s and early 1960s: for example, ""Moon Beams"", ""Waltz for Debby"", ""How My Heart Sings"", or ""Explorations""."
5,Great famil history,"This book brought back great memories of my family telling the stories of San Francisco during the early years. My great Aunts told about living in Golden Gate Park after the devastating earthquake of 1906. My paternal grandfather was an ironworker that help build the Golden Gate Bridge and the S.F./Oakland Bay Bridge. My uncle, my grandfather's son, was also an ironworker that built the S.F./Oakland bridge and the Richmond/San Rafel bridge. My uncle's last day on the job before retirement was doing the iron framework at the peak of the TransAmerica building. Yes, this is a great nostalgic book.Diane Olsen"
5,A great book,San Francisco is by far my favorite book of the 3 that i collect in books. I had this book once before but I think I lost it but I was glad I brought it back. This is why I buy most of my stuff from Amazon because you are a speedy service and my deliveries always deliver in short time. This book shows lots of pics of SF like in the 30s and 40s. I read the book a lot. Get this book today.
1,Not Well Researched,"I got this book for free and it was still too expensive. The information is taken from substandard websites, now deleted yahoo groups and tabloids. Much of it is untrue. I do not recommend this book."
2,minimally interesting,"Weak. The writing is simple and insights into life in Ireland are superficial. No great insights here and everything is centered around a very personal perspective with no real feel for the heart of the community or the nation. A mildly pleasant read that can be accomplished in a night or so. Not nearly the ""Under the Tuscan Sun"" Irish equivalent as a friend had suggested to me. I just felt like I'd learned less than if I'd watched a PBS special on Ireland. The writing was really weak and I can't believe the author is actually a playwright. Very superficial. Frank McCourts books are better if you want a feel of Ireland, albeit from an earlier time."
5,Well thought out...,"A remarkable work that delves into the field of human cognition and emerges with a fresh, intelligent perspective of how computers can and cannot support human cognitive efforts. Anyone interested in artificial intelligence and/or workflow will find this book an informative read"
4,"What are We to Make of Computers, and Computers Make of Us","Winograd and Flores' `Understanding Computers and Cognition' proposes that the rationalist tradition in AI must be replaced by a hermeneutic approach. Associating the rationalist tradition with the goal of building a human mind, the authors propose that a hermeneutic approach must adopt the goal of constructing prostheses which magnify the human mind. This paper argues that what AI needs is not so much a hermeneutic approach as a better appreciation of biology and psychology. Understanding Computers and Cognition is a groundbreaking book that presents an important new approach to understanding what computers do and how their functioning is related to human language, thought and action. Byte Magazine has recognized Understanding Computers and Cognition as one of the all-time 20 most influential books on information technology.Thank you!"
3,A little disappointed,"I read the 1986 or 87 version of this book and am of a software/AI background. I didn't follow the biological material that well - either I was being dense or it just wasn't clearly written. I thought the book was repetitious (my chief complaint). Some of the concepts discussed include: ""breakdown"" (humans become aware of thing X only when something goes awry in which the X is involved), ""thrownness"" (humans don't rationally consider all possibilities and make perfect decisions because situations they are put in don't permit such cognition and/or we simply we aren't capable of it), ""blindness"" (we are always somewhat blind to the prejudicies/assumptions that guide our thinking...and we can't totally escape this predicament. Also discusses the co-routine effect (per the software world) of human affects environment and environment affects world circularity."
5,Pegi Rocks!,"What a fantastic and unique new artist! I am just delighted with this new CD. Pegi really has a wonderful and melodic tone that is somewhere between easy listening folk and modern country. There are few new sounds out there today, but somehow this CD sets a new standard for a breakthough. I really love ""Sometimes"" and ""Fake."" Great job Pegi!"
3,Mary Kay Bronzing Lip Duoin Coral/Bronze,"the reason why i gsve this product a three was because when i had tried the products, the products were making my lips chapped. Also the package didnt arrived until about a week and a half to arrive at my house. So I was really disappointed about that."
4,Much better than a mouse with a ball,"There are mice out there that apparently have more precise movement, and that have a tiltable scroll wheel. But I just wanted to replace a mouse that had a ball that constantly gathered dust and had to be cleaned every few weeks just so it would work at all. This mouse seems to do the job well, and doesn't have anything to get gummed up."
5,Very Good,I bought this because the old one I had completely quit working. You couldn't do anything with it. I think it is very good. It does what a mouse should do. It is very easy to install because all you have to do is plug it in. Very good.
2,CANT READ IT,"This might have some good info, but the VAST majority of pages are too light to read. I know this is a collection of copies but still....ery tough to read. Might be better off finding the info on google ..."
4,Amazing start,"Bianca's rendition of The Rose is what sold me, her voice is solid with perfect pitch and maturity for one so young. She will be a hit with the younger generation, the only criticism I have is that most of her songs are full force and I wish she would have mixed it up with a few softer selectons to show the full range of emotions that she is capable of delivering. She is a bright young lady and has an innocence about her that I hope she will keep."
5,Bianca Delivers,This girl can sing. Usually when I buy a cd there are some songs I don't care for. I like every song on this cd. I like her style of singing. This is a great cd.
5,Fantastic,"Bianca, age 12 did a super job on her first CD. I have heard it twice and can pick out about 6 hit songs. There are songs for every age in the album. Bianca is quickly becoming a huge star. This fast selling album is a great start to her career.At this rate by Christmas Bianca's first album could make it to #1.I hope someday she makes a rock CD including some of Janis Joplin's greatest hits. I wonder if she can do any Elvis songs."
4,Not the best mixed CD..,Bianca Ryan has a great voice and energy and stands out even on much older singers. I am a bit disappointed on the CD but not on her performance but on the bad mixing! I hope they will change personel behind the CD the next one will be a five-star one. And I know it can be better.. just listen to the special-CD by/on Walmart (five track cd) with bianca Ryan.. that one is a SIX STAR (out of five) !!!
4,What a voice!,Bianca has a voice so much older & BIGGER than her age...Nice to have her 1st CD.. probably many others to follow.
2,Bianca Ryan,"A little disappointed in this CD. She has an amazing voice, but is trying to hard to shout grown up songs"
5,Music from a fairy,Simply the best voice that I've listened in my life from a girl.The Bianca's voice is fantastic.
5,Excellent CD,Excellent CD from someone so young. Her voice appeals to young and old alike. I wish Miss Ryan much success and happiness.
2,MOSTLY NEW SONGS (TO ME),"THE VIDEO I RECEIVED (AND PLAYED) WAS BIANCA AT AN AMERICAN IDOL CONTEST. IT WAS INCREDIBLY GOOD AND PROMPTED ME TO BUY THE CD. HOWEVER, THE CD PALES IN COMPARISON. NEVER HEARD MOST OF THE SONGS SHE SINGS AND NOT ONLY THAT, IT SOUNDS LIKE THE ORCHESTRA IS TOO POWERFUL"
5,amazing,This girls talent is truly amazing. I didnt even listen to mychristmas cds this year because I was listening to her cd over and over.
4,Great voice,Such a powerful voice for a young girl. I get chills when I hear her sing And I Told You I'm Not Leaving. Wow! Wish I could sing like that! Great CD.
5,She Connects!!!,"This young lady connects with her audience even through the faceless medium of a CD. I've read reviews that say she is like ""Streisand or Celine Dion."" I would submit to you that she is not like those singers at all. Streisand and Dion are great...But they don't revive the human spirit the way this young lady does. She doesn't sing; she sculpts her voice in the much manner of a fine instrument played by a master. When I heard this CD I had the feeling like she was showing me her very heart and soul. I think what we are seeing is debut of what will be one of the best vocal entertainers of this centry. Superior entertainment!"
4,What Happened To You ?,What a voice ! Where did she go ? This project is a collector's item love the arrangements and her renditions of previous recorded songs . Come back Bianca ! Is the voice still there ?
4,Stunning,"Bianca's voice and singing ability is nothing short of breathtaking. More than a few big-name have attempted to sing The Rose, all have failed to evoke anywhere near the same visceral effect that Bette Midler does. Bianca gets to about 99% - which is saying a *lot* for someone so young. I truly hope we hear more from her soon. In the meantime, pick this cd up. You won't regret it."
3,Bianca Ryan,"First off- this girl can sing! Bianca is an extremely talented singer with an amazing vocal range. Unfortunately, the songs on her debut cd are totally wrong for her. It seems as if the producers of this album decided to put together a hodge podge of songs in a variety of styles in order to play it safe and try to please the public. As a result,the album doesn't have a cohesive (over all) feel to it. In spite of the lackluster song choice,Bianca's vocal performance shines throughout and that is the albums saving grace.I wonder how much of a say Bianca had in selecting the tracks. Hopefully,the second album will include more original material with an overall cohesive style along with catchy melodies that effectively show off Bianca's vocal range. The right songs are the key to Bianca's future success."
3,Great voice but so so songs.,"You can't argue that Bianca Ryan can sing any song put in front of her well. Amazing for a child. I only wish the songs she sang were better. My daughter,18 & myself found ourselves skipping through many of the songs and in the end I wouldn't listen to this CD twice. I will probably sell it."
3,Good in patches,"The album has its high points but overall lacks ""punch"". A good example is ""Elizabeth Reed"", 17 minutes long (much longer than the Fillmore version) but unfocussed. In the Fillmore version, Dickey Betts' somewhat laidback solo is followed by Gregg's keyboard and then Duane's searing guitar solo. Duane's absence is sorely felt here (strange since it's a Betts composition). Here, Dickey does the post-Gregg solo and it just meanders, not going anywhere. His intro is not much better. The earlier solos, mainly keyboard, lack focus too. On the other hand, Dickey shows his chops on ""Ramblin' Man"" and a few other tracks. ""Jessica"" is pretty good too. On the whole the album works well as a substitute for ""Brothers and Sisters"" (five of that album's 7 tracks appear here, and they are on the whole improvements). Get this if you're an Allman fan, but get Fillmore first, to know what they sounded like when Duane Allman was still around."
1,dreadful,"where the Live at the Fillmore album, the bands 1971 masterpiece, is arguably the greatest album of all time, this is, in my humble opinion. the worst live album by a major band ever. One star is too good a rating. The beginning of the end of the first golden age of the band. The rhythm section is asleep, Dicky is too busy worrying about whether to be called Dicky or Richard to play with passion, and Gregg doesn't know where he is. AVOID AT ALL COST. BE THANKFUL IT IS OUT OF PRINT."
4,Mid 70's gem with a twist,"I just listened to this recording and i have to say i was very impressed, several of the live tunes have a more jazz flavored tempo due to the excellent work of longtime Stones pianist Chuck Leavell. The high points include Elizabeth Reed, Southbound and Jessica all delivered with skill by the brothers lineup at the time. With D. Betts doing all the guitar work and the added keyboard the listener experiences a tight 6 man unit delivering the tunes with the skill and precision that the ABB are known for. I don't understand the critical reviews of this CD as the performances are top notch and the song selection is fine."
5,wonderful music,"they sing ramblin' man, southbound this CD got a lot more. i did not get it from amazon but i only got it for 3 bucks."
5,TRACKS ARE...,1. This Crazy Love 2. Little Love Can Do a Long Long Way 3. Whatever It Takes 4. Love Has a Mind of Its Own 5. Is This Any Way for Us to Say Goodbye 6. Where the Fast Lane Ends 7. It Takes a Little Rain 8. Looking for Love 9. Little Late to Say Goodbye 10. Rainbow at Midnight
3,A Great Ride in th Tunnel of Love,"This is a very funny film based on the Broadway show with the same title. The plot concerns Doris Day and Richard Widmark's attempts to adopt a baby. Directed by Gene Kelly, the film is a bit stagey with long stretches of dialogue between Richard Widmark and his next door neighbor played by Gig Young becoming a bit weary at times. However, whenever Doris Day shows up on the screen, everything seems just fine. She's bright bubbly and bouncy in a roll that gives her a chance to show off her comedic talent and even gives her a chance to sing a little. The title song, TUNNEL OF LOVE is quite catchy but a tune she sings at a party half way through the film titled RUNAWAY SKIDADDLE SKIDDOO is very fine. She made a lovely recording of this tune for Columbia records. Buy this film. It's well worth owning.(One major complaint. The film is in black and white. Color would have certainly brightened the mood)"
2,A Lightweight Comedy,"I like Richard Widmark, and absolutely love his movies. I have yet to see a ""bad"" one, or one I did not like. However, the part in this movie was far too lightweight for him. He's much too good of an actor to be in such of a role. He's best in tough-guy parts. He fits those like a glove.This film, which is about a couple's desire to have children, is a good film for the most part, but it doesn't do him justice. He was miscast in this part. This is a Cary Grant type of film. Doris Day is sweet and lovely, as usual, but Gig Young is totally annoying. His part could have been deleted completely.As I said, the story itself is pretty good, but it could have been better."
3,"Disappointing, try Let It Break instead","I only recently discovered Gemma Hayes. After hearing her music in the film ""Janie Jones,"" I decided to buy a couple her cd's. All the great reviews of this album convinced me to purchase this debut album along with her 2012 release, ""Let It Break."" I was disappointed in ""Night on My Side""--I think the band overwhelms her great vocals and lyrics, and in particular she has a hard time competing with the overly intrusive drumming. Gemma Hayes is a 5 star singer on this 3 star ""average"" album. Consequently, I have only listened to ""Night on my Side"" once. If you are new to Gemma Hayes, I suggest you try ""Let It Break"" instead--the band takes a back seat to (and compliments) her beautiful voice and wonderful lyrics, which is as it should be."
5,AMAZING!!! Why is this IMPORT ONLY?,"OK...I broke down and bought this album (at the import price), thinking that I'd like it based on some of the descriptions. Oh my gosh...I have no idea why this album hasn't been released stateside. This album has true range, intelligence, and strength. After every song, I thought to myself....wow, that was amazing. Gemma can go from a soft, accoustic whisper to a hard, driving rock song without it seeming forced or strained. Do yourself a favor and give this album a shot. You'll be glad you did."
4,Absolute suprise,"This CD is quite extroadinary. It shocked me, and i am a severe muso/critic type (so i tell myself). There are so many subtle but amazing elements to this album. The atmosphere is the main feature that attracts me to Gemma Hayes' ""Night on My Side"". The styles and influences vary from song to song, but there is this ever present feeling. With folk, country, rock, and even some blurry kinda My Bloody Valentine (kinda) layering and repetetive hypnotic landscapes. I am fascinated by many of the arrangements and ideas behind the songs (dont go lookin for narrative lyrics). Suprising melodies and riffs have forced me to listen to this CD for the last 3 weeks non stop. But it may take you time to lose your expectations and work out what she is doing, because she is in fact rarely doing only one thing. Sneaky."
5,Beautiful,"This album turned out to be far better than I anticipated. I had heard about from the astralwerks website and had heard one song. Well the album turns out to be even better. Gemman Hayes has a wonderful voice, lyrics sweet and full wonderful lines, the guitar work very nice. There's just no one comparable that I know of to her."
5,Faith and Journey,"Janette Oke is a premier christian author. I love her stories. She is a talented faith-based writer. Good elements combine for anenjoyable read. Excitement, love, passion, fear, hope.....has it all."
5,Canadian West series,"I really enjoyed reading this book, as well as the first three in the series.Informative and inspirationalI laughed and cried, and it was hard to put them down"
4,When Hope Springs New,I like this whole series of books. Very insperational! I can't imagine living like that. It keeps my interest and I keep coming back for more.
2,"Was this book written by the same Author as 1,2,and3?","I devoured the first three books of this series. My heart was with Wynn and Elizabeth, I ached to know how things turned out And after begging my husband, he finally went and got it. I started to feast, aching to know if they would ever have a child.What other adventures were in store?I flounderd toward the middle of this book. Having to re read and back track a little, but it was no use... It did not even seem to be the same Wynn and Elizabeth. They did not seem to speak the same, care the same. They lacked...themselves. I put it down, stopping there and just sat...not completing it at all."
5,Why can't these be found anymore?,The fingerprint feature was a very nice thing on this device.Unfortunately it broke (somehow a shoe with 100kg/220lbs was too hard on it).It is though still working (without the plastic cover one it).
3,Perfectly good product but not what was advertised,"Ordered a 'biometric' jetflash stick; got a 2gig stick with built in software which allows partitioning and encrypting one partition, but nothing biometric about it. Kept it anyway, as the price was good and I needed a new stick - but be aware that what you order may not be what you get."
2,"Everyone is entitled to an opinion. IMHO, NOT his best!","What we have here is essentially a re-release of MOST of Jim Stafford's first album on MGM (Wildwood Weed is shamefully missing here, as is, unfortunately, ""My Girl Bill"" and, thankfully, Stafford's HORRIBLE version of Mr. Bojangles). Included are the single-only ""Undecided"" and ""Your Bulldog Drinks Champagne,"" which was a hit a couple years later.This is a good intro to Stafford but the guy was putting out funny stuff well into the '80s. There needs to be a definitive collection. This ain't it."
2,You forgot some hits.,"Hey guys great Best Of.... well almost the best! I hate to be a big ole whiner so you'd better get some cheese and crackers to go with this whine. So here goes! Even though you covered some good sounds of Jim Stafford. Where's Cow Patti, Wildwood Weed and I Got Stoned And I Missed It? I mean come on, The Last Chant was on the flip side (45 Version) of Wildwood Weed. And it made the cut. The notations on the back of this CD ""Bonus CD tracks"" should have included these hits. So Polygram Records how about a CD set with everything Jim recorded. And maybe a DVD of his TV appearances including his show. I'd definately buy a copy."
1,Feeling Gyped!,"I bought this CD on Jim Staffords reputation. Now, I'm feeling totally gyped! Only ""Spiders and Snakes"" is worthy of critique. It's a really good piece of writing. All the rest [are really bad]."
3,I stand corrected.,"My original review: ""Unless I am taking a bath in the River of Senility, I find all of these Jim Stafford ""hits"" to be re-recordings and NOT the original versions. A Pity."" ---- (the following is added by me, Spins 'n Needles, on 3 Dec 2012.) --- Frankly, I have no memory of writing the original review that I supposedly posted. Having said that I just checked the individual songs and I agree that the recordings ARE the original recordings. HOWEVER, I agree that key Stafford songs were omitted from this album. My advice to Stafford fans is buy the individual MP3's and move on."
3,Not the best of his recordings,I loved Jim Stafford the first time I heard him sing Spiders and Snakes.This C.D. just does not cover his comedic talent sufficiently though it does show varieties of songs he has done.
3,Jura-Capresso S9 Avantegarde,"I owned the earlier version of this model the S8 and saw no reason to change, until the machine broke after 13 months of household use. I returned the S8 for store credit and purchased the updated S9 Avantegarde. It's now been another 14 months and the S9 has now broken. I sent it to Jura-Capresso for repair and it was returned after 10 days still broken. I love the coffee this machine produces but it seems to come at a high cost if it only lasts 13-14 months. I'm still working with Jura-Capresso to get the machine fixed but it's now been 6 weeks and I still do not have a working machine. The retailer I'm working with states super-automatic espresso machines on average only last about 24 months!"
3,Mike Score is being a DRAT,"Come on Mr Score. You hire these guys who probably played at the Rock n Burger in Myrtle Beach and had them re-recorded your best tunes. Zoinkers...the new versions sound ok but how about making new stuff...it's ok if it sounds like ""Dream Come True"" (aka ""Flock IV""). What's up with that album cover pic...cripes. How about ""On Your Knees 2012"". I decided I'm gonna hire the other original AFOS members (Ali, Paul ..and that other guy) and we are all gonna re-record my tunes from the 80's...songs many of us know like ""Brian on the Phone"", Castiglione Pt 2"", ""Danny"", ""Grandma Neeeeesh"", ""Jeepers My Trousers"", ""My Dog Buku""."
2,Not Worth It,"This movie is not worth the time, money or effort, Bad acting, silly special effects. What happened? This effort is far below any other of Dario Argentos work. I was looking forward to this and was dissapointed."
1,This is what happened when Daria left Dario,"As most Argento fans know, Daria was Dario's partner and collaborator from Deep Red on through Opera. In other words, she helped Dario achieve his great artistic peak that spanned about a decade, and spawned the lead actress of this film, Asia Argento. Well, if Daria can be given shared credit for Dario's greatest successes, perhaps we should blame her absence for this dismal, cheesy atrocity.I imagine this film would be painful and numbing for any viewer to watch, but it is especially excrutiating for a fan of Argento who has seen the masterpieces of which he is capable. At any rate, I urge everyone to stay far away from this debacle. Watching it is akin to undergoing the sadistic torture that Argento's villains subject their victims to in Dario's other films. You've been warned!One final note: don't confuse this movie, Phantom of the Opera, with Argento's much different and much better movie, Opera."
3,Out of Synch Sound - see Video Watchdog 57,The magazine Video Watchdog has an article about the sound being out of synch on the 5:1 track for about 40mins of the movie (noted on some review comments below). Correct sound in 2:0 track.
3,has Dario lost his mojo?,"After the dissappointments of Two Evil Eyes, Trauma, and The Stendahl Syndrome, Dario Argento has returned to form (well, sort-of) with The Phantom of the Opera. The script is by Roman Polanski collaborator Gerard Brach, and the film is gorgeously shot by Ronnie (Opera) Taylor. The murder scenes are pretty cool (the chandelier scene is awesome), but Dario needs to go more balls-out like he did with Opera and Suspiria. Not bad, but knowing Dario's work, it could be alot better."
2,"Coolest Cover, Worst Version","There are still a few versions of Phantom I haven't seen, but so far, this has to be the worst. It has the best cover art and the most boring flow. I could accept the liberties taken (no mask, raised by rats) if it weren't for an execution of the plot that made me want to fall asleep. Never mind that the Phantom's costume was awful.I gave this movie two stars. One star goes to the cover art, the other a combination of Asia Argento and the chandelier scene, though even that scene would've been better had he a disfigured face or a mask."
1,easily Argento's worst film to date,"This film, PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, is without question, without doubt or without whatever, Italian horror director Dario Argento's worst film to date.... I'm of the belief that if you haven't got a good script, well then you haven't got a good movie either. And this film's script has no redeeming qualities. What were they thinking!? It's not scary. Not the least bit. And it never manages to be funny in a dark sort of way. It's just boring. So when the basic premise for the film is this lousy, it doesn't really matter if the photography is pretty and that the cast is all-in-all o.k. The film was simply built on a much too lousy foundation, and thus it crumbled to pieces upon where it stood. It's best that we just forget about PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, and instead see SUSPIRIA one more time!"
2,Dario Argento's Phantom of The Opera,"The Phantom of the Opera is one of the greatest stories ever told. It make a perfect horror theme and it's been done so many times. I called Argento the master of the kill because each one of his movies usually has one awesome kill. That all being said, this movie should have been a pure winner. Well, it's not. The opera scenes are beautiful, the music is good if not standard, but the story sucks. The Phantom is raised by rats and his face is not scarred at all. The one problem I had was during the kills the screen just turns black and all you hear is screams and thuds. I have no idea why they would do that but oh well.Dario Argento's Phantom of the Opera is not the best version of the film by far. If your a hardcore fan of the story, movies, or Broadway plays then you may want to stay away. If you know nothing of the story and just want something to watch then i'd check it out."
2,Guilty Pleasure,"It is not the best movie ever made but it is watchable, mainly due to Morricone's Music and the opera selections. Asia Argento plays the main heroine, young talented opera singer Christine. I don't think she was bad and her face is unbelievably beautiful - she reminds Olivia Hussey of ""Romeo and Juliet"" (1968) and Uma Thurman if Uma ever decides to dye her hair dark. Production values, costumes, special effects, decorations, and the singing voices are very good. I noticed that I laughed a lot during the film - perhaps Argento made a dark comedy of the familiar story?I did not like Julien Sands as a non-masked Phantom. He looks a lot like the creatures that raised him.The film has an orgy scene that is so funny it could've came directly from ""Caligula""Overall - I had a lot of fun, and and can call it one of my guilty pleasures.2.5/5"
2,Dario Argento's worst effort,"This is easily Dario Argento's worst movie. It's got very little of his signature traits (most notably the cinematography), Ronnie Taylor's assistance (from Opera) doesn't help a lot either. It's biggest asset is easily Ennio Morricone's awesome musical score.What we do get however, is some over the top gore (well served, of course) but for this movie it simply doesn't apply. It seems also that handling romantic situations isn't Argento's cup of tea. The love story between Christine and the Phantom gets more ridiculous as the movie progresses. The brothel scene is a bit hard to take. And finally, the humour misses big time.That said, a bad Argento film is not a total bore at all. Julian Sands is good as the phantom and is not to blame for the movie being unsuccessful, the music is wonderful and we at least get a very original take on this often filmed classic."
3,"Something new, something different","I've read most of the negative reviews about this movie. Fortunately, I read them only after I purchased it. Having never seen any of the previous ""Phantom Opera"" movies, and never having read the book I was presented with something completely new. Perhaps the negative comments are from those previously exposed to the subject, and having pre-formed opinions about what the movie should be about clouded the objectivity of many. I found the movie refreshingly different. I did not take the movie seriously, as apparently many did. I believe Argento was striving for more of a comic book feeling, ala Batman, Re-animator, etc. Those approaching the subject with an open mind will find the movie interesting, even if somewhat disjointed, and a worthy addition to their Argento collection. Julian sands performance was certainly underwhelming at best, and I feel his performance should have been over-the top to really pull it off. But all in all I liked the movie."
3,Misleading Notice?,"I've not yet seen the entire disc, but I have noticed that both sides of the DVD seem to be Flat / Pan & Scan prints. There is a little bit of croping on a title card but that seems to be the extent of it. I don't know if this is a glitch or if this is correct or what, but it is something that may be an issue that needs to be corrected.An interesting movie so far, but be warned of that potential issue."
1,Interesting representation- very different from the book,"I did not care for this version. It is very gory in some places and it doesn't follow the plot of the book very much. I was surprised at how bad the story was displayed. The Phantom seems to be compared to rats too much, which was not in the book at all. Plus I didn't care for the settings because I had thought that the cellars under the opera house had been built, and in this movie they were catacombs of sort. I wouldn't reccommend this movie, read the book instead!"
1,Where's the mask?!!,"I don't know if you really care but, contrary to the cover, the phantom in this film does not wear a mask (though judging from his horse-like face, maybe he should!). Personally, I think the movie itself is worse than any face a mask would ever hide. The plot is tampered with in the worst ways, the intimate scenes (which shouldn't even be there) are horribly scripted, and Christine's boyfriend is a complete jerk!Seriously, I can't think of any reason why anyone would want to make a POTO movie this way! I'm not even talking about the mask now, though the mask itself was somewhat symbolic in the original story. This is about taking a story and ripping virtually everything good from it. Yes ,there are some good parts, but they are few and far between."
1,the star is for the soundtrack only,"I was surprised that this was so unwatchable. It took great intestinal fortitude to sit through this piece of corn. I am baffled that Sands would involve himself in this, and I am shocked that our famed horror-film maker would release this with his name on it. The soundtrack is excellent, as is all of Ennio's work, but for goodness sakes this is a really bad movie! Stick to the originals as far as buying Phantom goes, and if you plan to remake it, try sticking to the original story!!!!"
1,Hideous and unbelievably ridiculous,"Raised by rats?? How did they feed him as an infant?? How did he learn to speak??Most gruesome movie.... And the casting... Okay, I only lasted 15 minutes, so I can't detail, but puleeze! It would be just as believable a script had he been raised by tomatoes!"
1,A poorly made and very flawed movie,"There is no doubt in my mind that Dario Argento is a brilliant director, but this movie is terrible failure. An uneven reinvention of the Phantom tale in which Argento borrows from Batman Returns and other films, then combines it with Odious Comic Relief (the ratcatchers) and falls far short of his masterworks. The score by Ennio Morricone is plush and beautiful, but borrows too heavily from his previous work (the tunnel chase is just the Roof Top Chase cue from The Untouchables reworked)."
3,It IS in Widescreen !,"Whatever you think of the actual movie, the DVD IS in widescreen...you just have to change some settings on your player to see it that way. For some reason, the disc was manufactured in a way that won't play the WS side automatically...instead it stretches it out for 16x9 making it look full-frame on both sides. But, if you go into your DVD player set-up features, choose LBX or 4x3 and all will work fine. On my player (Panasonic), I had to change the settings in two separate areas to finally get the WS side to play correctly. It's there, though, so go get it. The movie itself is substandard Argento, but still entertaining in a weird sort of way....much more watchable than Trauma or Stendhal. And I couldn't believe the amount of nudity in the ""unrated"" DVD...something not usual for Argento. The DVD image is OK, but there is some artifacting going on in the background, but it's not the worst I've seen. Overall, it's a must purchase for Argento fans...flaws and all."
1,THIS BITES!,"I cant belive they even used the title Phantom of the Opera in this cheap stupid remake! And people think Phantom of the Paradise is bad! It's an insult! I have been a Phantom fan since I was 7 and I have seen every movie bearing the title. About this version I just have to say, it bites, nothin' else to it. I mean, did the people making the movie even read the book, see the musical, watch the Lon Chaney movie? Basically the only similarities between this and the other versions is that it's in an Opera House, that's it. Even the Robert Englund movie was better than this. If the Phantom were real he would be insulted!"
2,This can't be true - crap from Argento,"I love Dario Argento and his works, so this was a big dissapointement. This movie uses every exsisting cliché in the galaxy and contains some poor jokes who not even were close hitting. The only good things i can say about it is:1: Not too bad camera work (but far from the best Argento hasdone).2: Good FXBut it is still a very poor movie to be a Dario Argento."
2,No Curtain Calls,"Argento is renowned for his camerawork, but he really stumbles with this badly done production. Julian Sands looks like Michael McKean from ""This is Spinal Tap,"" and I want an ""uncovering his scarred face"" scene, not the weak ending that seemed a little tacked on. Asia Argento is okay as Christine, although getting naked for daddy's films is a little odd. The costumes and cinematography here were great, but the rest of this is unwatchable."
4,Fun with the phantom,"Incredibly enough, I found this wickedly funny. The reason that so many of Argentos fans hates this movie is probably that it's not typical Argento. Instead it's a very italian ""Felliniesque"" picture, which has it's own wicked logic in fragmentary form. Sets, cinemantography and costumes are wonderful as usual in a Argentomovie. And the music by Morricone is highly romantic, one of his best scores in recent years. The quota of nudity is unusually high for Argento but in line with the subject. The gorescenes are a bit hokey, but often effective. And the fat diva Carlotta is a scream (no pun intended), getting most of the (intended) laughs. However, one drawback is the colorless leads (Sands and Asia Argento), the dubbing sometimes hurts and the scene with the burning rat-trap is only embarrassing and totally misjudged. But all in all, disjointed but unexpected fun."
1,The worst Argento ever,"Admittedly I still haven't seen ""The Card Player,"" which is supposed to be completely rotten -- but I've seen nearly all of Argento's other films, and this is BY FAR the worst. The acting, the script, the 'special' effects -- dear god it is just unfathomably bad. The two leads are godawful in their roles, and the script is no help!"
1,Dario's darkest hour deserves ZERO stars...,"Fans of ""Suspiria,"" ""Deep Red,"" ""Tenebrae,"" ""Phenomena"" or any of Dario Argento's other accomplished horror films will be appalled by his inept retelling of ""The Phantom of the Opera."" It goes to prove that a bulk of prolific directors from the 1970s and 80s (such as John Carpenter, Tobe Hooper, George Romero) somehow went astray when special effects began to consume horror.This movie is loaded with gaudy set design, underdeveloped characters, and gore scenes that--surprise!--seem to rip off the late Lucio Fulci (i.e.--the phantom bites off one victim's tongue and face in close-up)! There is no atmosphere and no pulsing Goblin music to set an ominous, spooky mood, so what does that make this ""Phantom""? A load of junk that feels like a rerun of that old ""Beauty and the Beast"" TV show (you know, with Ron Pearlman and Linda Hamilton), rife with horrible acting from Julian Sands (""Naked Lunch"") and the director's daughter..."
1,Take away the junk from this film....,"and you'll find more junk underneath. Argento, Sands, everyone connected with this film should hang their heads in shame for coming up with or starring in a piece of crap like this. An amazing disservice to the tradition of the story, the book, and all the actors who've played Erik previously. This would be a good candidate for ""modern lost films."""
2,interesting.....,"I rented this movie knowing it was rather unfaithful to the novel (what movie isn't) and that it was gory. Thus prepared, I sat down to watch it. Big mistake. The other reviewers pretty much covered everything...no mask, rat sex...Dario's daughter in lots of graphic sex scenes, bad plot...yeah. The only reason I gave it two stars was because it made me laugh...and cringe (not in a good way, though) and I'm a phan, but that doesn't change the fact that this movie really sucks. Sorry Dario,I thought you had more sense."
1,Phantom Insult!,"I bought this DVD hoping that it would reflect on the story of the oringinal Phantom of the Opera written by Gaston Leroux or on Andrew Lloyd Webber's version but I was utterly disapointed!I must say that some scenes were ""interesting"" but the storyline was really bad. I think that if this Movie had any more nudity of sexual scenes it would have been rated as a porno. Seriously, I found this movie as a disgrace to Leroux's story and a disgusting way of portraying Christine Daae's character as the Phantom's whore. The Phantom character wasn't even deformed, classy, or a musical genius, just some guy raised by rats in the celler of the Paris Opera House. If I could I would give this DVD/Movie a big fat ZERO it isn't even worth one star let alone $18.98!"
1,WHAT?! WHAT DID I JUST WATCH?!,"This movie is a bad acid trip from the millionth layer of hell. No, seriously. When I get bad acid, this what I see acted out in front of me. If you are a fan of Leroux's story, DON'T WATCH THIS. IT WILL LEAVE YOU SCARRED FOREVER!!! Just hold on a little bit longer for the movie version of Lloyd Webber's musical to come out in December. It is the CLOSEST to the story as you get. Ending and all. Praise be to Universal pictures for included the scorpion and the grasshopper in the 1925 silent classic, but they seriously messed up the ending. BUT BACK TO THE MAIN TOPIC, DON'T GET THIS. THIS MOVIE IS BOGUS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION!!!!"
1,For the music only!,This version of the 'Phanton of the Opera' should appeal to the younger crowd who enjoy a little blood and much gen-x acting. Nonsense and a waist of time. From the DVD player to the garbage. Who could possibly compare this trash to Fellini. And Asia get a life instead of a acting carrer.
1,Who on earth made this garbage?,"Okay so we are all entitled to our own opinion but this is the only film version of The Phantom of the Opera that is terrible! The cast, espcailly Jullian Sands, all need to get a little something called talent! Whoever wrote this is a sick person who shoould never be allowed to write anythign ever again! Same goes for ever directed it! Gaston Leroux is proably humilliated that his name was even on it! Don't waste you money on it! I loved thee one with Rob Englund and think that they were trying to remake it! Platrozism and a bad film! What A combination!"
1,A More Vulgar Version...,"I simply could not stand to watch this movie. I am a very loyal fan to both Webber and LeRoux, having enjoyed both of their versions of the tale. However, I was very disturbed as to how this movie portrayed the story. The Phantom is a derranged pervert who has nothing but a sexual obsession with Christine. There are several vulgar occurances that go on between Christine and the Phantom that I'm sure neither Webber or LeRoux had in mind when writing their masterpieces. The Phantom is seen as someone who kills for pleasure, a lunatic; certainly not a Michael Crawford. Whether you fell in love with the book, or saw the musical and were in awe of the theatre, this movie will definitely ruin the idealistic tale of the Phantom for you."
2,"Strange, Strange film","This movie is a strange film. It is definately not the Romantic film that the musical is. This film is definately a horror film with several gratutitous scenes of senseless, and expected violence. This movie reminds me of a B movie. Some people might call this a 'Movie House' movie but I would have to disagree. It appears to be made on a large budget and is bad.Scenes play out as any melodramatic horror film would. You have seen all of these bad scenes before without the guise of a ""Classic"" wrapped around them. This reminds me of some movie experiences where you hope the movie will get better, and it never does. Strange bordello scenes, skillful erotic scenes, and bad horror film making really don't mix well."
3,Nice logo,The watch came quickly and from a distance is a nice head turner the logo is bright. I will say the band doesn't look like it will last very long. It's ultra thin and my father wore it for 2 days and it already shows signs of wear. Just be ready to replace the band in a few months. I will say my father loves it so I'll give it a 3.5 stars
2,Not what I expected,"I was looking for tinwork ideas and patterns I could trace, cut out and punch. This book goes into the geometry of creating elbows, cones, etc. It is more of a math book. It's not what I was looking for."
4,I Miss Idealism,"This documentary rates 4 stars instead of 5 only because it is less than an hour long. Much more could have been included, even restricting the story to 1969, the year John & Yoko staged their Bag-In, two Bed-Ins, got married and recorded ""Give Peace A Chance."" The story of how quite possibly the world's biggest star devoted his celebrity to fighting against a war halfway around the world -- a war he had no financial reasons to oppose -- is continued on the DVD of ""The U.S. Vs. John Lennon."" These two movies together make a nice overview of the idealism on the era, when two pop stars thought they could end the war by willing it.Naive optimism, idealism, ""you may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one."" One naive optimist is worth a thousand jaded cynics."
2,Not what I was looking for,"In this book, Simpson tries to guide the reader along the journey to God. His route includes conversion, purgation, illumination, the dark night, and divine union. He includes many personal and historical examples, as well as his own philosophical insights. It is in the midst of all these words that the journey is lost. Perhaps his experience of the journey is different form mine. (Simpson is a married man, with a PhD in Greek philosophy, and a member of the Episcopal Church.) There were moments when the book was clear, unfortunatley these are few. Perhaps the analogy is to take advantage of these moments. In life, we may only get moments when we get small glimpses of the divine nature of God."
1,It sucks!,This movie sucks 100%One stupid girl removing teeth to herself and to her friend.That's the only scary scene in the movie.The end is one of the worst I have ever seen in the horror genre.Do a favor to yourself and avoid this title!
5,Great Satire,This is a truly funny satire of political thought. The main character is a philosopher in Sparta who dispite authoritarian and military rule is allowed to speak out about the system.
2,"Not bad, but not spectacular","Probably the weakest of the Style Council's albums, but it does have some good points. ""Walking the Night"" evokes a feeling of tramping dark, lonely streets in the wee hours; the title track is quite good as well. The main problem with the album is the much larger inclusion of Dee C. Lee. I'm sorry, but her voice has never sat well with me, and it's never more apparent why than on this album. She has a very generic, un-interesting voice. There is no oomph, nothing special about it. It's much better suited to singing in a chorus than dueting or taking lead. ""A Woman's Song"" evokes nothing in me, because her voice has no feeling to it, even though the lyrics are fantastic. Also, ""Angel"" has such a gorgeous melody, but her voice completely ruins it. She's trying too hard to sing out of her range, which isn't that great to begin with. I know she was Mrs. Weller for a time, but certainly was never his equal musically."
5,Perfect for fine hair or as a combable hairspray,I got this product for free with another purchase and I like to use it when I need a little hold but not stiff. My husband has baby fine hair and this gives him the volume he needs and a texturized look as well. I also love the tact that its made for gray hair or blonde tinted hair (keeps it from looking brassy).
1,one n only shiny silver,makes your hair hard. would not recommend it in the least. Total waste of money.Gray hair is course as it is without adding product that makes it hard!
2,Common Sense?,"In ordering this book, I was hoping to get some insight, some understanding of how women think, how to achieve social success, how to deal with rejection. I certainly didn't need someone to tell me to brush my teeth and iron my clothes before going on a date! While the book is cleverly written, and amusing at times, it really didn't offer much to me in terms of information."
4,"No promises, but an interesting book...","Granted I've labeled myself amongst the ""dating impaired"" for awhile before I picked up this book. I decided to review this book about 6 months after I've been through it and see where my life is. As far as dating goes, I'll say it has improved. I'm not sure whether it is the content of this book Or just my life in general.Anyways, the book is neat and filled with good stuff for those who aren't too sure about dating. However only you can decide how the advice in the book will be used. Some of the information in this book you'll look at and say ""duh"" and some you'll say ""will have to remember."" Do with this book what you will. Above all, have fun!"
3,"A decent buy, but nothing that can't be found Online","I bought this book because I was a late bloomer. The book offered good advice and did the legwork of a few Google searches, but overall, the content is not rocket science - it's common sense.My advice would be the following:1. Do a complete self-scan, and make improvements that make you feel good about yourself.2. Go to places that you're comfortable (no, this is not your home, it's places with other people with SIMILAR interests).3. Talk to people. It's amazing what a simple conversation can lead to4. DO NOT, under any circumstances, think about being rejected. If there's a fear of rejection, which we all have, thinking about it will provoke the stressful feelings that come with it. My advice would be to accept rejection as a part of life and an element that makes us stronger.Anyway, that's my review. I felt like that before buying the book and it didn't change me."
1,Not That Great,"This book states the obvious. It only reinforces what the average intellagent person already knows. Furthermore, it bashes bisexuals. I'm bi and took offense. :("
2,Book too General,"When I bought this book, I was looking for how to get a date. I was truly disappointed with it. It was too general, and it did not give enough specific advice for my taste."
1,Be careful: This is the miniature edition!,"This is the miniature edition, which is a hugely abridged version of the paperback book!"
3,"Decent, but other books better","This book is a little too common sense. While I enjoyed the humor, I found it difficult to identify with the female author's view of things (I am a male 27 years old). For you men out there, I highly recommend ""The Evolution of a Warrior"" by C. Regan for a great book about (in part) how to pick up and seduce women and how to conquer your fear of the opposite sex."
3,A waste of time,Book was too long. Too much information and advise was very outdated! Seemed like she was living in the 50's or something. Some very basic things were questioned. I was confused after reading half the book.
2,Nothing new,"I listen to Dr Joy and most of the time, I agree with her. This book, however, is all fluff - I didn't learn anything from reading this book. I guess some people may find it useful since it's about your perspective."
4,"REALISTIC, WHICH IS HOW IT SHOULD BE","THIS BOOK HELPED TURN THIS ""HOPELESS"" ROMANTIC INTO A ""HOPEFUL"" ROMANTIC. LOVE, TRUE LOVE, IS NEVER EASY TO FIND. THIS BOOK EXPLAINS WHAT TO DO WHEN LOVE SHOULD FIND ITS WAY TO YOU. IT HELPS YOU BECOME WHO YOU TRULY WANT TO BE AND HELPS THE HEART BEAT STRONG. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO THE LONELY, THE HAPPY, THE INSECURE, THE FRIGHTENED AND THE ROMEOS ALIKE."
5,Best Dating Book I've read,"This book is awesome!! Frank and detailed advice on how to date--from where to go for the first meeting, the second date, etc. How to be clear if the person is not for you, warning signs, etc. Will save you lots of time in regard to the common mistakes and thinks of things that I wouldn't necessarily consider on my own.Goes into great detail but is clear-headed and realistic. I recommend it to my friends, clients and anyone wanting to date or currently dating."
3,I'm alot smarter about dating now!,"This is a great book for anyone who gets nervous about dating - It's very helpful. Dating can be scary sometimes, but this books helps to clarify some relational issues, and help you analyze how your date went, and perhaps what could have gone better (or worse!). Dating for dummies covers everything from flirting, to asking, to planning the first big date -- all the way to sex and breaking up! Reading this book has helped me to think more objectively about my dates, and give better advice to my friends."
3,Dating for Dummies,Arrived on time but was midled regarding the size of the book. I didn't realize it was the miniature version.
2,Dating for dummies,"This book contains some useful advises, however, although the author claims that the book can be useful for both sexes and all ages, it's not quite true. I tried to apply what is written in this book (although it contradicted to what I knew) and spoiled a relationship that started perfectly well. Guys, be careful. This book will tell you that you have to call you date the next day after you got her phone number, and other things like that making you excessively and annoyingly nice. You'll be better off getting a book written by a guy for guys or even better talk to somebody more experienced in dating that you."
4,Songs for Palace supporters worldwide,"""Glad All Over"" is the essential CD for Crystal Palace supporters worldwide. While the classic Dave Clark Five hit is sadly not included the 1990 FA Cup Squad's is, as is ""When Eagles Fly."" Also included are all the palace favs from the '70s to the '90s, including Terry Venables (ugh) immortal rendition of ""Bye, Bye, Blackbird"". Listening to this CD will remind all Palace supporters of why we torture ourselves pledging our loyalty to the Red and Blue."
2,Useless to a biologist,"This book provided nothing that wasn't already obvious in biology. I read this book on my own initiative, being in a microbial ecology class, with the expectation that I would gain some terrific insights into the development of the basic metabolic processes that make life function today. Instead, I received a long-winded retrospective narrative that commented on events already evident in life today. ""One day, bacteria developed glycolysis, and it has been popular ever since."" Thanks, Margulis, for such keen insight. Want to inform me that bacteria somehow use lipids in their membranes?Absurdly general and simplistic, that tells a reader things he/she already knows. Is there no speculation about how photosynthesis *might* have developed?"
4,"I have to say, since I am Dorion Sagan","that that last reviewer did not know what the bleep they were talking about. Yes, this is a very good book but, listen, my mum, Lynn was the one who put the idea of ""seme"" in Microcosmos! Where people (and Richard Dawkins was one!) get off ""mind-reading"" who writes which part of a co-authored book is beyond me. The writer was correct, however, that this is a very good book, perhaps the best, for a nuts-and-bolts overview of early life. Now for some fluff: Check out our new book Acquiring Genomes: A Theory of the Origins of Species--if you like it, Frank (or whatever your name is) be sure to credit the good parts to me! Also check out Up From Dragons: The Evolution of Human Intelligence and Into the Cool: The Thermodynamics of Life (forthcoming) if you are curious..."
3,not what was advertised,purchased hose assuming it was the red hose advertised. received black hose. not a major issue if color doesn't matter to you. I wanted the red hose to match existing upgraded parts in engine compartment.
3,A question we all should ask,"1040 is a 27 minute thrill ride that will make you question how you live your life. From the opening sequence you are thrown into the terror that the main character faces on a nightly basis. As a result of intricate character development, you begin to question the other character's motives and oftentimes find your original evaluation to be inaccurate. Though the acting at times is a little rough and the scene transitions are obviously not the product of a major production company, 1040 will leave you wondering, ""When is my time?"""
1,Piece of Junk,The first thing you notice on this abomination of crap is the fact that the domed top of the piston that takes the most pressure and beating when you pull the handle down to cap is made of SOFT PLASTIC. How positively stupid is that? In about a week of use the inner spring piston area became deformed (you guessed it - also soft cheap plastic) which prevents the capping bell from retracting and now I have to manually push the capping bell back up after every cap I put on a bottle. This is one beyond belief piece of junk.
2,To much plastic,"While this is much faster and easier to use than an Emily capper, it is very cheaply made. The center piston that holds the bell bends as it is pressed down onto the bottle. I usually have to hold the bottle in place for fear of the bell shearing off. I would recommend looking elsewhere to find a better capper as I am not very happy with this one."
1,Not worth the money spent.....,"I spent about $39 to purchase the Super Agata bench bottle capper and I already feel like I got cheated. After capping only 10 to 15 bottles, the little magnet that holds the crown caps in place came off never to be found again. Also the small plastic rectangular piece used to adjust the moving unit up and down according to bottle size got badly mangled from the start. This capper does not come with instructions, I cannot find replacement parts anywhere, and each time I tried to use it I ended up grabbing my old Emily capper (which btw costs only $18.00 or so). I definitively do not recommend this product!"
3,Not really a mystery,"I'm an avid mystery fan but this was the first mystery game I've actually played. It was fun to dress up and play the game, but my guests and I were disappointed in the mystery. I think part of the problem is that the murderer doesn't know s/he is the one until the last round, so until then it's just a matter of giving out all the information in the scripts. In the last round when all the information is out there, then there is only one person who could possibly be the murderer and everyone ""guesses"" it. I wouldn't play another game of this series, I'm going to try another ""brand"" and otherwise I think I'm going to try to make my own."
2,Annoying Toggle Icon,"It is a great idea to be able to toggle from black and white to color, but it would be much more enjoyable to watch if there wasn't the camera icon on the upper center screen throughout the whole DVD. I have two DVD players and both of them show this annoying icon and there is no way to get rid of it. Great idea for a Three Stooges DVD but not enjoyable to watch at all with that spot on the screen. I have done a little research on the net and found out that it does this on several models of DVD players."
3,NO TO COLORIZATION!!!!!,"I bought a couple of these out of desperation for some of the shorts. Now that Columbia is releasing these shorts the way they should be, these DVD presentations are obsolete and I can get rid of them. I've never watched the colorized shorts and never will. Colorization is an insult to the creators of a film. This would of been a 5 rating if not for the inclusion of the colorized versions. Also, there is a small superimposed object in the upper right corner that looks something like a camera. I have to hit my display button to remove it. I've got no idea what it represents. It appears at the beginning of each episode."
1,Columbia Pictures are STILL Screwing The Three Stooges,"Stooge fans must NOT support this product! It would be downright stupid of the consumer to keep purchasing the same shorts over and over again. Men in Black we already got, and don't need another one on DVD. Colorized version would be ok with me if it were included as a bonus feature on one short. There are so many shorts we all would prefer purchasing that are yet to be availabe . . like Cash and Carry, and Three Little Twirps. Columbia Pictures screwed the Stooges out of alot of their deserved riches, and now Columbia Pictures are screwing us. DO NOT BUY ANY DVDS THAT CONTAIN LESS THAN 5 SHORTS AND HAVE RE-RELEASED TITLES."
1,Can I give it less than one star?,"Oh, boy. Just when we thought ""colorized"" films were dead and buried, Columbia resurrects the corpse with a quartet of Stooges shorts in that heinous format. And some of these shorts have been on DVD already! And four shorts for $25 SRP!This is an abortion, and I plea with all Stooge fans to boycott this junk until Columbia comes to their senses."
1,Leave the stooges alone!!!,The three stooges are supposed to be in black and white. It's kinda what makes them unique. Aside from joe and curly joe this is the worst thing that has happened to the stooges! There's also only 4 episodes on this disc! Don't buy this!
2,Don't waste your money!,Cute idea but does not work. Camera jams every time you load the pictures. You need an adult to do it and even then it jams. My three-year-old was very disappointed that she could not get it to work.
1,garbage,The pictures get jammed in the camera and are very hard to remove. One picture got stuck in there and so this toy was broken after about 2 days of play.
1,Disappointing Toy Camera,"Given as a gift for our 4 yr. old's birthday. Believe the giver was as disappointed with the gift as we were. No instructions, save for the outside of the box. It does say 6 pictures can fit into the camera, but not possible. Easily jams, as the pictures have only one way of sliding into the camera and it's not easy for him to get them out of the camera. We thought there might be a way of viewing the pictures inside the camera, but there isn't. He hasn't played with the item since his birthday, which was several weeks ago. Would not recommend this item even on sale."
3,"Fun concept, but design needs improvement","This camera is fun and educational. HOWEVER, the pictures are difficult for a child to load into the camera without adult help, and as another reviewer said, the pictures get jammed easily. Also, only 5 pictures fit into the camera, not 6 as stated on the instructions."
4,My Daughter loves it -,"We bought this toy for my daughters 2 year birthday and she loves it. She loves when her picture is taken and insists on ""reviewing"" the shot so I thought she would love this toy, and she does.The good points are you can put your own picture inside the picture frames that pop in and out of the camera.Its a tough toy so dropping it isn't a problem.Bad point: it didn't come with directions, and its jammed twice.but, if you can get it on sale, its a great toy!"
3,Going Home,"The book arrived in good condition and on time as promised. I meant to order the hardback edition, so I was a bit dissapointed when I received the paperback one. However, this was my fault for not re-reviewing what I had ordered."
3,Well written,"I am impressed with the writing style of this book. I can't believe it was her first ever published. The only reason I gave it three stars is because, hopefully, being that it was written in the 70s, a few of the heroines actions regarding her state of health in the book, which wouldn't fly these days. Unfortunately, I don't feel sorry for the heroine, and I can not identify with her feelings."
5,Bullworker is superb,I've been using my Bullworker for about ten years now (the same one). This alone speaks for it's durability. The principle is simple - the harder you press or pull against it the more resistance it generates. This is what makes it such a superb muscle building device. It's portable and easy to store. The range of exercises it can be used for is enormous and it will allow you to build up any of your muscle groups. I can't praise this highly enough. The Bullworker is one of the best things I've ever purchased. I must have saved a fortune in gym costs over the years.
5,First Hand Knowledge!,"I designed the DVD workout for the steel bow and the product is wonderful. I am not being paid to say this, I have used hundreds of resistance devices over the last 27 years and this is by far the most versatile, durable and portable one yet! Excellent product!"
3,Could be valuable if it were comprehensible,"I'm a professional computer scientist specialising in artificial intelligence. Charles Bowling comes across as well-educated and a clear and deep thinker in his tour through the history and philosophy of rational thought. Unfortunately, his style of writing takes some getting used to and he is far from good at explaining his original ideas, with the end result that I find the descriptions sufficiently inpenetrable that I can't work out if he's a genius or a crank. He may have had some fantastic ideas but, without having many spare hours to try to figure out what he's trying to say, it's hard to tell. If you come to his work without previous familiarity or some other assistance, I wish you luck, and if anyone can figure out how valuable his contribution is then please let us know!"
4,Needs serious sharpening first,"The handle is substantially smaller than the handles on my Henckels Five Star knives. That's not a problem for me. It seems comfortable for full size adults as well as young teens.The handle ends are highly polished, and the blade is not so polished. Overall it looks nicely made.The length of the blade is nice for paring, and the knife handles well.I expected the silicone handle to be softer, and there isn't a great deal of difference between it and a hard plastic handle in ordinary use. The silicone doesn't have as much of that grabby feeling I was expecting either.The edge bevel is more suited to an axe than a kitchen knife. I found myself reaching for other knives the first evening. After dinner I took it out to my belt grinder, ground a finer bevel, and sharpened it. Now I reach for it when I need a parer."
1,Sucks,This product is absolutely horrible. Tried having a whole dedicated week of keg tapping for a local college event and got nothing but foam!!! Tapped keg on several different occasions and tap does not properly seal! after 3 kegs i finally wasted more money just to go get a cheap rental from the local grocery store that worked 10 times better then this junk. It is also cheaply made with cheap plastic that is not durable. after first use one hose was broken. After cleaning product and trying it one last time for a grad party it spit foam foam foam then finally crapped! right after thirty days. worse money I have ever spent!! I never even do reviews for products but everyone needs to know this is junk and to stay away from it!
2,one tape great-2nd tape lousy,"In this 2-tape set, one of the tapes is a good, narrated tour of Alaska with excellent photography. The other tape is an outdated tour of tourists looking at the sights of Alaska: tourists walking, tourists looking out of windows, tourists taking pictures etc. Quite a disappointment."
4,Buy the original version instead.,"Pente is a great game, but 20th Anniversary Edition is a real disappointment when compared to the original. With this new edition you get a cardboard playing board, four sets of pieces (w/o bags), flimsy (but nicely printed) rules, and a box. It's everything you need to play, but it's still not as nice as my set from twenty years ago. I wish I'd saved the money and put it towards a nice [$] Go set."
4,Convinient and Cute,"This is very convenient for when I carry around my cat to my dad's house on weekends. The fleece inlay that it comes with is very soft and comfortable, my cat sometimes just lays in the carrier when we're around the house. I love the pink color! Carrier is not as sturdy as I'd like it to be though I still like all of the zippered openings from where my car can go in. The stroller is very easy to open up and fold back. I also like the ability for the carrier to become a ""car seat"" simply by buckling a seatbelt through the loop in the back of the carrier. All in all, this carrier and stroller are good for the price, very convinient, and sold in very adorable colors!"
4,Uppercase Stamps,"I thought these worked pretty well. It was a bit tricky at first to get the bottom line on each stamp lined up so the letters were in a straight line. Once I got that figured out, they worked out great. My daughter is 4 and just needed a little bit of extra help with some of her letters. Clean up is pretty easy, I just wipe them off with baby wipes. Not as easy as just printing out some worksheets, but this way you can customize to work on their name or whatever you want."
5,Great item for school teacher,"requested by the 1st grade teacher, glad to get it for the classroom. Good item to guide children write letters."
3,love it,"Had 2 handsets for this phone initially, and they would wind up all over the house since none of the family wanted to use any other one. Easy to find with the flashing tip on the antenna and the page. We've grown to like the audible caller i.d. also - keeps us from jumping up unless we need to."
1,Scratched My Fish !!!!,I have a betta and this plant came up in the search I typed in. In only a single day it hurt my fish Filbert and he now has a large cut over his eye and multiple other places. So this product is unsafe for betta fish and possibly many other kinds of fish so be careful when choosing this product.
4,Couldn't find this anywhere,"I really needed this cable so that I could record to my Dazzle. I went to numerous stores including Wal-mart, Radio shack, and even Best Buy. Nobody seemed to have one or even hardly knew what I was referring to. As soon as I found this product I ordered it (there was limited quanitites left). So far it's worked great. The only thing I did have a problem with was on the red, yellow, and white side there is a little too much plastic around each of the connectors so that it won't stay plugged into a dazzle. I had a dremel on hand and in about 5 mins just shaved that extra plastic down so that I get a tight comfortable fit into my dazzle. I gave it 4 stars only because of this. Otherwise a great product at a reasonable price. I would buy again."
3,Beware thick connectors,"This appears to be a good cable because it is thick/solid and I like that it is 8' instead of the standard 6 foot that so many cables are. HOWEVER, please be aware that the AV/S-vid connectors have a very thick casing on them so they will NOT pluf into all TVs. I found this out with my TV, the connectors are sunk just a bit into the frame and this cable could therefore not connect to my TV, I had to go get a different S-vid cable that did not have the thick plastic around the connectors. Not all TVs are like this, but some are, so be aware of this issue."
5,Gilbert and Garbo in LOVE,"One criticism--and only one. The sound track could be better. The occasional laughter (live audience) in the background is annoying at times, but for Pete's sake, this film is more than a sound track; it's Gilbert and Garbo! It doesn't get any better than that. Gilbert is dashing, and his natural, playful sense of humor adds fun to an otherwise serious role. Garbo is beautiful and brilliant. If you compare this abridged version of ""Anna Karenina"" with the other ""Anna Karenina"" starring Frederick March, you'll see why I find ""Love"" so alluring. In ""Love,"" Gilbert and Garbo sizzle. In ""Anna Karenina,"" Garbo and March fizzle. Maybe that's because Garbo was in ""Love"" with Gilbert on and off screen. As far as I'm concerned, the superb acting makes up for the flawed musical score."
4,Classics done live by a classic.,"I remembered listening to the single ""Go away little boy"" from this album years ago and always preferred not only Shaw's version but her live version particularly.She brings a casual familiarity to the song that makes me feel like someone I know is singing this Carole King classic.""At Last"", ""Them there eyes"" and ""Unforgettable"" are all fine covers in an album full of covers, but she really put something into her rendition of ""Go away little boy"" that made the disc worth buying."
3,satisfied,It is a good book.The subjects are well balanced so that it may be used as a textbook for an introductory course. The copy that I have received is still in good condition - although not as good as it was claimed to be!.. - to be used in class work.
4,Budget device for home experiments ONLY!,"I use this device MOTU 8Pre for my home experiments, it works most of the time. But... Accidentally, unpredictably, it starts BUZZZZIG and HUMMMING at the HIGHEST volume level! So that, it's not safe for your ears, not to mention your amps and speakers. And imagine you use it for a real performance!!! This device is not safe!!! It can accidentally produce a signal that can damage your equipment and your ears! I thought it was because of my Lenovo FireWire chipset... I tried it with a true TI-based FiWi. Same thing. I'm a computer programmer, so, I know what I'm talking about. Please, MOTU guys, please, fix your firmware ASAP!!! That's impossible to use it as is now! It's not good for your reputation, really. My name is Maxim Shemanarev, if MOTU guys do care about their reputation, they HAVE to fix it ASAP!!!Update: The problem was in the Drivers for Windows. In the new version it's solved. Thanks MOTU! So, make sure you use the latest version."
5,RB's best blues album,"Roy's best selling studio album to this date is still pure class after 34 years. Unlike many albums he made before and after this one, SECOND ALBUM has a consistent direction to it without being dull like alot of his later work. First of all, AFTER HOURS is bliss (NOTE: listen around the 1min 20sec mark, when it sounds like he gets his fingers stuck between the strings! FIVE STRING BLUES consolidates Roy's belief that he was half-man half-wolf - he makes that telecaster squeal, whinge and carry on like a pork chop. Personal favourite: I WON'T TELL YOU NO LIES; a jazzy, impressionist masterpiece that's still classic Roy.This album plays to Buchanan's strengths: with only 2 sung-songs, there's plenty of room for Roy to steal the show with his swashbuckling fretwork. Don't miss this one."
5,An absolutely wonderful read!,I loved this book which was given to me as a gift. I've visited Poland nine times since 1972. Leonard Kniffel captures the communist and post-communist Poland very accurately. His observations are honest as he discusses the good and bad in present day Poland. Needless to say the good far outweighs the bad!
5,Must read for Polish descendants,"I, of Polish descent, thoroughly enjoyed reading this book about the author's trip to Poland to find his grandmother's family. I wish I could live there and meet the Polish people. His descriptive writing shows that he enjoyed his visit and the citizens. The Polish surnames may confuse non-Poles."
4,A relatively unknown gem,"I've been listening to Tull forever and pretty much all their albums stand the test of time rather well. I still try and watch them live every chance I get and have often driven long distances to do so. War Child is an excellent album that always sounds fresh every time I listen to it. The hallmark of good music is that it sounds good every time you listen to it, even if it is after several years. My personal favorite is Sealion."
4,A very good album.,"Yes, there are a few shallow, fill-up-the-album type songs on here. Including one about having to fill up albums with shallow songs. But there are some excellent songs as well, touching on the usual themes of religious silliness, individuality, and ""living large,"" that make this a must-have for any serious Tull fan."
3,You can never go home.,"This record in my opinion and in the opinion of those acquaintances of mine familiar with Jethro Tull is not very good. You may disagree if you hear it (and, of course, you are certainly welcome to disagree), but it's hard for me to imagine you will.I doubt it's possible for any group with a considerable output to be consistently good, but to those of us old enough to remember, this and the subsequent ""Too Old To Rock And Roll, Too Young To Die "" (which I've never bothered to listen to in its entirety) represented the end of an era in popular music, an era dominated by progressive rock and MUSICAL exploration (as opposed to ""alternative"" posturing).Jethro Tull's, then great, popularity dwindled to a cult following, a rabidly loyal cult following it seems (see below), but Jethro Tull and popular music were never to be the same."
3,a notch below,"After a streak of four brilliant albums this one was a bit of a letdown when released. That doesn't mean it's not solid and worth owning. Other than the trite ""Queen and Country"" and the popish ""Bungles in the Jungle"" every song here is good listening. It's just that the material doesn't compare with Aqualung or Benefit. A reasonable comparison would be Led Zeppelins ""Presence"" compared to its sensational predecessors. It signaled that the peak was past. But it's a good addition to any collection and a must to hardcore Tull fans. The quality of the recording is above average as well."
5,Jethro Tull - War Child,"If you like Tull, War Child is a definte must for your colection. ""Skating Away"" and ""Bungle in the Jungle"" hit the tops of many Tull greatest hits lists, but those best of albums only are great when you have limited space, the true fan will dig deeper. War Child is a great album to see the range of Tull. ""Sealion"" will show the edgy side and ""Only Solitaire"" will bring on this band's suttleness and minstrel quality that made you listen to them and want more. ""War Child"" and the ""Third Hoorah"" open the first and second sides of the album and bring the cohesion of the album together. The closing of the album with ""Saturation"" seems to pave the way to your purchase of Crest of a Knave - Steel Monkey indeed. Also, check out [...] another phenomenal album from a band with true longevity."
5,Archetypical Tull,"Warchild is the source of the FM radio favorite ""Bungle in the Jungle"", which might just be the *worst* song on the album. 'Queen and Country' and 'Skating Away on the Thin Ice of a New Day' are wonderful tunes replete with Ian Anderson's baroque lyrics and composition; this album is a 'must have' for any Tull fan, new or old."
4,War Child - Hoorah,"At first I was not thrilled with this CD, but themore I listened to it, the more I liked it. There are some really good tunes on here, and some less that good ones, but overall, if you like Tull, yuou'll like this one. Quite a bit different from Aqualung, but it has some decent hits on it."
1,The Pandora Key by Lynne Heitman,"I have not read The Pandora Key, due to the fact that as I turn each page it falls out. This quickly stopped my enjoyment of the book, as I nervously turned the page to see if it was just a printing accident that would stop as I read on. They're still falling out by Chapter 4 (pg. 24) & I put the book aside. The book is a Pocket Book and was inexpensive..which shouldn't mean cheap! I hope they fix their presses before too many more books roll out.Jeanne NorrisConstable, NY"
1,Too Complicated to Have Natural Conversation,"My husband and I hosted two murder mystery dinners with another company. We then played this one. Our guests and us found this game to be very detailed and complicated. Improvisation and the flow of regular discussion was difficult because you had to follow such a complicated WWII plot and know how to pronounce all the French names. The other games we've played (made by other companies) were very easy to play, conversation flowed naturally, and the plot wasn't so thick that you couldn't have fun. Also, this game series doesn't tell the muder that he/she is the murderer. The other games we played let the murder know bythe first round. Personally, I think it's easier to play if the murder at least knows at the beginning if he/she is the murderer."
5,It was a mystery .....,We played this on New Year's Eve. The setting can be formal and that's the way we played it. Everyone was so into the game that we almost missed ringing in the new year at midnight. We kept going until 1:30 am - not bad for an over 65 crowd. The clues had everyone guessing until the very end. The guests can't wait until we do this again.
4,Excellent base layer for cold weather motorcycling,My test was a 30 minute motorcycle ride at 35 degrees at speeds up to 60mph with these thermals as a base layer under just street clothes and a leather jacket... the product exceeded my expectations. The polypropylene material partially blocks the wind while retaining the majority of your body heat. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was because the material is substantially bulkier than it appears in the photos. If your outer clothing is loose then it's no problem but don't be tempted to buy a size larger than normal for you.
4,"Amazing product, but...","...they are way too bulky. They look and feel more like a sweater than thermals. Perfect to wear under ski jacket, but for casual wear in cold weather, people will think you put on 10 pounds overnight and it will for sure keep you warm. Maybe I should have gotten the smaller size."
3,Good not Great,I bought it for winter motorcycle riding. You might want to but one size larger than what you normally. Works though..keeps you nice and warm.
3,design flaw,"We lived in Northern Alaska for 25 years and my husband worked for the Alaska Air Guard, so he spent a lot of time out in the worst weather. He says those strips of thin fabric down the inside of the arms and sides would be a serious heat loss zone. So, he doesn't really want them. I don't think this feature was mentioned in the product information. I thought it was just a different color of polypropylene from the picture of the longjohn top."
1,The short version:,"1 - Defective design: the thermal loss through side ribbing.2 - Incompetent cut: size pattern modeled on a bigger-is-better concept, but without any attention to standard human proportions.3 - Poor manufacture: stitching wanders along the line, skips and remains loose across the ribbing, the fabric catches lint pills when washed, and there are stray threads and thread ends across the garment.4 - Could-care-less shipping: speaks for itself.5 - Not worth the effort and postage returning and so put in the sweatshirt for chain saw work pile."
2,"Good Information but lots of out of date ""science""","I thought some of the information in this book was useful but when I hit page 42 ""Clearing Up the Cholesterol Confusion"" I was really disappointed. The author is about 20 years out of date as far as research goes and sticks to the AMA party line like glue. There are several completely unsubstantiated claims, such as page 51 ""Combined with exercise, calorie intake that matches energy nees and not smoking the G.I. will help you live a long and healthy life"". Really? How much longer? The actual GI chart contains a symbol meant to represent food that is ""bad"" for the heart. I was in agreement through the cakes and cookies but when it appeared in the meat and dairy I knew the author had either not done her homework or did it with a completely closed mind."
3,Ok Nutrition guide,"This is a book for someone who knows little about nutrition i tells you what a protein is, a csrbohidrate etc. A bit to simple for my taste and little deepness in Glicemic Index. Still Think The Zone is the best book."
1,Size does not fid 1985 Celica Supra,This din (wiring not included) didn't fit my 1985 Toyota Celica Supra. The only place I found the correct size was at Crutchfield.
1,Get the other one,"If you would be looking for a Best of compilation by Eric Burdon and the Animals you would be better off buying `Best of Eric Burdon and the Animals 1966 E968E which in my humble opinion is about the best there is with most of their best songs but is now old, having been released in 1991, so needs remastering or something. To comment on the review below neither of these CDs have ""House of the Rising Sun,"" ""Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood,"" and ""We Gotta Get Out Of This PlaceEon them. Oh I wonder why Mr Bernabo? If you really were aware of music in the Sixties you might have realized that the original Animals fell apart in the latter half of 1966, Eric Burdon continued with essentially a new band EEric Burdon and the Animals. Slightly different name in quite a different style singing different songs."
5,"Ah, the Oldies!","Bought this as a gift for my husband. Unfortunately, Sky Pilot was NOT the full length version he was looking for. But Eric/Animals have always been a group I've remembered w/fondness, so I enjoy it myself."
4,nice Laptop mouse,a good laptop mouse. have been using it since last month. kind of works well for me.
3,"Decent product, short cord","Product is fine, no Surprises. The scroll wheel is a somewhat tough, but works fine. The only downside is that the cord that comes with the mouse is rather short - works fine if your USB connection is on the side of your computer that you use the mouse from - not long enough if the USB connection is on the opposite side."
4,overall a good small mouse,"We bought the Logitech optical notebook mouse as an inexpensive full feature mouse for home use with a laptop. Among the few major complaints in previous reviews was that the cord is very short. We'd have to agree with this, since our port is on the left side rather than the back of the laptop, and we hope that the manufacturer is looking at the reviews. Otherwise no problems- we like the mouse a lot. We've only had it a few weeks, so cannot say anything about longevity."
4,Not quite what I was expecting but quality all the same,"First things first. This mouse is tiny and that was a surprise. I figured 'Notebook' mouse was a fancy way of saying 'hey, its a mouse -- and it will work with any computer including your notebook'. I won't make that mistake again. Fortunately I have the hand size of a nine year old girl so it wasn't an issue.I bought maybe a half dozen of these for use in a road show. The chords tuck away into the bottom of the mouse which was really nice for travel and prevented tangles and broken lines. It was small and light and worked perfectly. It certainly has a decent price. These have largely been abandoned back at the office, the staff prefer full sized mice but all in all they served their purpose well and I have no complaints at all."
3,Ok but not great,"The problem with this mouse is that the cord is very short. It works ok on my work laptop with the usb ports on the right, but on my macbook with usb on the left it doesn't even reach around the computer!"
2,Died quickly,"I would have loved this mouse had it not died within three months of my owning it. It fit well in my hand, and I was able to be used on most any surface. Unfortunately, it began dying while I was using it. For a little while, I just had to unplug and plug it back in and it would work. Then, it just stopped working all together. The next time I have some money, I'm going to invest a little more in a mouse."
2,its ok,"Its nice and portable, but it moves way too slow. I put the mouse speed all the way up and it's still way too slow....not very impressed..."
1,it broke within 6 mos.,"disappointed. i bought it in december 2007, now its may 2008 and its not working and the return window expired after 30 days."
2,Will make workers compensation attorneys happy!,"Don't buy it. It took me longer to open the packaging than I could mouse with it before I started to feel my index finger going numb. I am used to a smooth scrolling wheel; the wheel on this mouse moves in increments and is creaky & cranky. It can't possibly be good for the muscular structure of the hand and should come with an ergonomic hazard warning. On the other hand, if you're looking for 6 weeks off for a work-related injury..."
5,Hands down the best mouse you can get for your laptop,"This is a very high quality mouse and it's extremely portable. I've had this mouse for over two years without any problems. It's extremely accurate b/c of it's optical light, but it's main strong point is the fact that you can wrap the cord around the mouse for storage. Definitely one of the best investments I made for my Sony VAIO."
2,Cord management causes problems,"The cord management feature eventually causes the mouse to die. All of that unwrapping and re-wrapping of the mouse cord around the base eventually wears out the wires inside, and the connection becomes spotty and then the mouse stops working. As an example, the same thing happens when you bend a metal hanger at the same spot over and over. It eventually breaks. I would suggest going with a retractable solution or a wireless mouse."
1,"Works well at first, but a fatal design flaw","I have purchased two of these, and will not buy another. They have a fatal design flaw that makes them stop working after several months. The cord, which is so convenient and thin, and which wraps so neatly around the mouse, either pulls out of the USB connector or breaks internally at the point where it bends sharply. Somebody who does not wrap and unwrap the cord to use the mouse will probably never have this problem, but for a user who needs to pack the mouse away and unpack it frequently, this design issue is fatal. If you need a mouse that's truly portable, don't buy this one. Get a small Dell mouse with a permanent cord. They are a little bigger, but they only cost $7 at discount outlets, and they will last."
3,Ok for the price.,I bought this and the Saitek laptop mouse at the same time. I am using the Saitek. Easier to hold onto and smoother action. The cord on this mouse is very light weight. Do not know how well it will hold up with being wrapped around the mouse.
4,Inexpensive and comfortable,This is an inexpensive optical mouse. I did not find any problems connecting it to my laptop which runs under windows XP. Hooking it up to PC and pulling it out any time is not a problem. Its size is comfortable. The spacing between buttons and the scroll wheel are similar to regular size of PC mouse. It needs a USB port though. It is nothing fancy but efficient to serve the purpose and compact with card-wrap feature.
2,Very convenient but not for long!,"I bought the item about a year ago and I loved it. It's very functional and is perfect if you prefer to use a mouse instead of your laptop's pad and you are on the go all the time. What I noticed right away as a possible long run problem, was the thin cord which didn't seem very long lasting. However, that didn't turn out to be the issue. After about six months the scroll suddenly failed. Very weird indeed, but that's what happened, so i had to buy a new one...this time larger. My roommate has the sam one for longer than me and she didn't have any problems although she doesn't use it outside home too much. Anyway, i guess i wasn't lucky enough with mine."
1,"Looks, performs, and feels cheaply made","I bought this mouse for every day use with my laptop which I use as a permanent home desktop computer. What a disappointment! I have always trusted the Logitech brand, but they missed the mark here. This mouse is too small and does not fit my average sized hand. It looks and feels cheaply made, and I don't expect it to last very long. The scoll wheel is crude, and you can actually count the notches as you scroll. To move around a page, I have to pick the mouse up and re-position it on the pad to go very far. I have only used this Logitech mouse for a few minutes, and am ready to drive to Wal*Mart for a replacement. I bought it to replace a Microsoft wireless mouse that developed a problem with the left button. As a webmaster, I use my mouse more than the average person and have worn out several. $9.65 + shipping was a poor investmemnt. The only good thing I can say is that the shipping was fast."
3,Adequate product,this was good while it lasted - which wasn't too long. But I can't complain too much given the price.
3,I loved this mouse... until it broke.,This was a great little mouse until the thin cord began to give out. I used this mouse for a really long time w/ tape around the USB end holding the cord in place because I liked the feel of the mouse and didn't want to replace it. If I had to do it again I would not get this mouse. I now have the M305 cordless and love it.
3,Wrap cord wears out,"Worked quite nicely while it lasted, but the connection of the cord to the mouse wore out in less than a year, primarily due to all the twisting it undergoes when you wrap the cord for storage. Unfortunately unavoidable for this style of cord storage. This is why we need full-sized mice with retractable cord. Good enough for the price."
4,Petit mouse,This is great. The only thing I don't like about it is that the cable gets turning to the left after you unroil it for use. Good for the price though.
3,"great feel, a bit flimsy","I love the feel and action of this mouse, but it seems a bit flimsy. So far I've had two break on me when the mouse fell off a surface and didn't even hit the ground, just made the cable tug. Seems like the connection between the mouse and its cable is prone to becoming loose under stress, which makes the mouse inoperable."
2,"Loud, grinding wheel; cheap, fragile feel; discontinued, for real?","Epitome of ""You get what you pay for."" (Although I did get more Logitech plastic blister packaging than I paid for.) This mouse is like a cheap plastic child's toy.The scroll wheel is loud, and responds poorly. It has too much play in it before the knurls or whatever rotate. It's a clumsy constant annoyance. Can't imagine using it in a meeting or within earshot of some poor cube corral co-worker all day long.Old/discontinued product? Instructions say go to their website and download software. But I couldn't find a ""Notebook optical mouse plus"" anywhere on their site after searching via three categories, and visually, and by using their search box. The mini manual doesn't say what the software is for. But it worked when I plugged it into my MacBook anyway.It's back to genuine Apple for Mighty Mouse for me. Design matters."
5,Convenient,"This mouse is just what I needed for my netbook. It is small enough to pack away for travel, the cord wraps around the sides/base of the mouse and the USB plug snaps onto the bottom of the mouse so it stays put for storage. Originally I wanted a wireless, but with a netbook, I don't really see the need and extra cost. This works just fine."
4,Mouse Pad with Cord,"This mouse works well but the cord wind-up feature of this mouse really doesn't work. There's nothing to keep the cord wound, like a little locking device, once you initially wind it. The mouse itself is very good, though. It's much smaller than other ""mice"" I've used and works very well."
2,Lots of Trouble,"I've bought this mouse twice. Each time it would work great, felt great, just the right size for a traveling mouse, but then the first broke after about two years. I bought another this past January, it's broken already (October). Both times connection to the USB port went; exactly the same problem. I won't be buying this one again."
1,A PIECE OF JUNK,"AVOID THIS SUBSTANDARD PRODUCT AT ALL COSTS. A SHORT CORD FROM USB PORT TO THE ACTUAL MOUSE ITSELF MAKES NAVIGATING A COMPUTER SCREEN NEAR IMPOSSIBLE. MOUSE WORKS VERY ERRATICALLY....HARD TO CONTROL, AND SEVERAL TIMES CUT OUT ALTOGETHER. AFTER ONE WEEKS WORTH OF LITTLE USE, THE CORD LITERALLY CAME AWAY FROM THE MOUSE ITSELF. AND THIS IS ADVERTISED AS BUILT TO LAST. SAVE YOUR MONEY"
2,Long term report,"I've had this mouse for about a year and a half and today it died when it lost its tail. The wire that goes into the USB connector end is flimsy and eventually the individual wires just broke.This mouse has otherwise been good and accurate, but it just doesn't hold up to the stress of being wrapped up (as its supposed to be around its base) as much as someone that has a notebook computer may need."
5,The Mouse for Me!,"I really like this mouse. It's nice and small, lightweight but doesn't feel cheap, and has a matte finish that doesn't make my palm ""sweat"". I personally find corded mice so much less of a hassle than dealing with batteries, recievers, etc. The cord is thin and flexible. Actually, I am using it with my desktop computer as well! Only (minor) complaint is that the full featured Mouseman software isn't packaged with the product. The mouse does, however, work instantly with Windows XP (perfect plug and play)."
5,Defies Reality,"So I bought this mouse when I thought it was another one. I thought I was getting a bigger mouse, and while this one isn't a 'mini' one, it's kind of medium sized (I guess), I've actually gotten used to it and I really like it. It's small, responsive, easily portable, and no matter how many times I spill soda on it, step on it, drop stuff on it, and so on, it never seems to break. Definitely worth the money."
3,"I bought this mouse because of the good reviews, but","found it is not so good. I would say as a cable optical little mouse it is quite good compared to other similar products. But compared to the microsoft wireless mouse I'm using, this one has much lower resolution and responding time, you can feel it is different simply by dragging around for a few seconds. Although the wireless mouse uses battery, I still have to stick to it."
5,Super Satisfied,"I bought this mouse on a whim because I thought it was so adorable and I loved how the wire wrapped around the base. I'm SO glad I acted on that whim. Its got to be one of my favourite of all the mouses I've tried. Its small but not too small, you can keep the mess of wire in your laptop bag to a minimum with the wrap around base, it worked amazingly well, and it lasted me a good three years now.The wire on mine has broken inside I think since now it's a little glitchy. The computer sometimes doesn't see it so I'm here to buy a new one. I was thinking about purchasing a different mouse but I'm just so satisfied with this product I don't want to change. :DOnly problem is that the wire is a little short so if you don't have USB slots on the back right or right side of your computer, you should probably rethink buying it."
4,Simple but functional,I received this item in a timely fashion. It is a little small for an adult but it is used mostly by my kids and I have small hands. I would reccomend this product especially for the price.
3,"Mouse is good, but the cord is too small.",Quality-wise mouse is really good. But the small chord defeats the purpose of having a notebook mouse in the first place.I would not buy this one again unless the length of the cord is increased to atlease 1 - 1/2 mts.
5,Love this little mouse,I've used this mouse for two weeks now. I got it because the wireless mouse I had kept running out of batteries in important meetings and I just couldn't take it anymore.The way the cord wraps up is clever. The size of the mouse is pretty perfect for me. It seems durable enough (although it's not like I've backed over it in my car).
2,Failed after a few months use,"Had been working great. Then one day it just started behaving badly...like there was a short in the wire. Maybe it got treated roughly when I was not looking (I've got four teens). Based on other's experiences with this model, I'm willing to give it another shot."
1,Can it go any slower???,"This mouse had to be returned because it either went very slowly or didn't go at all. I had the mouse speed sent to the fastest, and the tortoise could beat it from one side to another. I replaced it with a Logitech V220 wireless, which is very good."
4,mousey,"It does what it should, and the price is right. Cord is very thin, so I see that as an issue over time. Cord is also very short, so if your usb port is on the wrong side, it can create some difficulties."
4,small and inexpensive,"I bought this mouse to use with my laptop. It works as well as you'd expect a mouse to work, although my only issue with it is that the cord doesn't seem like it will hold up for more than six months or so."
4,"Great ergonomics and feel, wire wrapping not the best..","Replaced my old blinking Targus mouse, repsonsiveness and feel lot better comapared to any mouse I have used so far..The wire wrapping around the mouse is not practical as it gets unscrolled and gets in the way. Better to have a elastic type cord to set to your prefered distance..I got around by unwrapping fully and using the USB ports on the oppposite side of mouse so wire does not get in the way.."
5,Great little mouse,This mouse works great on my laptop. I just plugged it into the USB port and it started working immediately. It has a scroll wheel that works like any other scroll wheel mouse and has the left and right buttons that you would use on a basic mouse. I would always recommend Logitech for any computer mouse.
2,Noisy laptop mouse with unbelievable packaging,"I bought this mouse because every laptop mouse I have had seems to last only about 6 months and this one has great reviews. So far, after two weeks, the mouse is working fine but I cannot use it in a conference or meeting because the scroll wheel is so noisy that it would draw attention. I have never heard such a noisy wheel. I was also very disappointed that the people at Logitech have absolutely no concern for the environment. The excessive amount of heavy duty plastic packaging seems more appropriate for the crown jewels than a cheap mouse. I needed a heavy duty knife to cut through the sealed plastic and then the sharp plastic edge cut my finger. In short, I would not buy this mouse again."
1,Very short life due to poor design,"The mouse cord wraps around the unit and it has to be stretched out and bent at one particular location to wrap correctly. Due to this poor design, as opposed to retractable cords used by other mouse manufacturers, the mouse went dead with only a few months of use. If you are not planning to carry the mouse around and leave the cord extended all the time, this is not a bad mouse. However, if you are plannig to use this mouse like how a notebook mouse should be used, then stay away from it. I was expecting this to happen when I first received my mouse in the mail, (I didn't know that it was a wrap-around cord at the time of my purchase.) but still not this soon. Overall the most poorly designed mouse I've owned."
4,Super Cub LP Standard Wing with struts,"This is my back up for the original. It is exactly what I needed, but I was a bit concerned when I received the package. I wasn't to sure that it was going to be in one piece. The box that it was shipped in was not in the best shape and appeared to have been crushed by something laid on top of it. When I opened the package, I was a bit surprised that it was still in one piece and not damaged. I checked it over real good and found no major damage to the wing except a few indention marks on the top surface. It doesn't appear that this will have any effect on the dynamics of the plane. It was very lucky that there wasn't more damage than it appeared, but even this could have been prevented if there had been more protection and better packaging. It may not be so lucky to survive the next time!"
3,try gorilla glue first,you may need this if your a starter like me but invest in some gorilla glue for you broken wings first.
5,An Outstanding Resource!,"As a parent of an adult child I found this book to be an outstanding resource for families dealing with the realities of changing times. The concept of twentysomethings as ADULTescents is well defined and clearly developed by the authors. Using a combination of anecdotes, interviews with focus groups, and summaries of research, the book provides background information and practical strategies for parents facing the challenges of interacting with twentysomethings in a positive and constructive way. As an educator, I also appreciated the attention to the social issues and changing expectations facing young adults, particularly those related to gender roles."
4,Interesting book,A good book to read to understand more of what your twentysomething children are going through.
5,Great shirt at a great price!,I Love the one I ordered a year ago so much that I just ordered another one at twice the cost! It's been through at least 20-30 machine laundries and tumble dries and still looks great. Highly recommended!
1,The service from amzon is good.,I bought this nautica t-shirts a month ago.. and they are damn cheap when compared to the price in the mall...I was expecting them much later but I got them few days after I ordered them...only problem I have is the tee's are lil bit loose even though they are small size...
1,"Terrible product, terrible customer service!","I purchased this unit and received it from Kaito with a broken casing. After many, many phone calls and nonsense they agreed to send me out a new unit. I had to send the old unit back and did so with expedited shipping so I could get it back asap. It wasn't until nearly a month afterward that I received the replacement. Upon using the station I realized the temp readout was not the temp of he iron, far from it. The recovery time was awful, and the tip was very shoddy. After using the unit for approximately an hour it died and I don't have the time to deal with Kaito Electronics once again. Please save up a few extra dollars and get a Weller or Hakko. I threw away a month of my time, and some of my hard earned money and still need a soldering station."
3,ULTIMATE MOST RELAXING GUITAR MUSIC IN THE UNIVERSE,Had I listened to this before buying I wouldn't have bought it. Not that many good classical guitar cuts.
4,good,This is a great relaxing musical bargain. The songs are fit for all kinds of relaxing and soothing of all aged aggravation.
3,balanced perspectives and opinions,"Several different authors write about multiracial identity and give different perspectives on it. Pros and cons of multiracial identity are discussed. Most of the writings are straightforward and honest, not much of the typical boring one-sided race discussion.Multiracial writers are more capable of presenting more balanced views on race issues than are whites or minorities. I am a proponent of multiracial identity."
5,CHROME 2-3/4' TRIGGER SNAP HOOK 5/8 SWIVEL EYE,USED !THIS PRODUCT FOR CONNECTING TO HANDBAG STRAP. THIS WORKED WONDERFULLY IF YOU ARE USING IT FOR SEWING. WOULD RECOMMEND IF USING FOR AN HANDBAG STRAP.
5,Hnak Jr. and friends,"What a great album. This is a real tuff one to find. This was Hank Jr.'s first release after his fall off of Ajax mountain in 1975. This album showcases the likes of Charlie Daniels , Marshall Tucker and some great session players. The song 'Losin You"" is Marshall Tucker all the way.If you are a hard core Bocephus fan as myself this album is a must have.Enjoy and lets keep this classic stuff forever!!!!"
5,HANK WILLIAMS JR AND FRIENDS,"THIS IS ONE BEST ALBUMS BOCEPHUS HAS EVER RECORDED WITHOUT THIS MUSIC WE PROBALY WOULD NOT OF HAD FAMILY TRADITION, OLD HABITS, ETC. ALL THE SONGS ON THIS CD ARE GREAT BACK IN 1975 ROLLING STONE CALLED THIS ONE OF THE BEST OF THE YEAR. GO OUT AND BUY THIS CD AND YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED. MY FAVS ARE I REALLY DID AND CANT YOU SEE."
3,three & a half stars for da son of da Hank!,"Interesting cover of marshall tucker's can't u see and cool originals like stoned@da jukebox. a good listen but i can't tell ya that i reach 4 it as much as say, Steve Earle's Train A Coming or Johnny Cash's American Recordings. Interesting bit o' Southern Rock trivia-Chuck Leavell from the Allmann brothers plays on album, which places it firmly in da Southern Rock Houvre."
4,Simple and cheap!,"These are great if you have limited space in your garage, and the ceiling isn't available. It works on both road and MTBs and is easily installed on wall or post. Be advised that the bike needs to be centered in the hook and trays (I also bought the bottom tray for more stability) or it will shift on you. Not a problem unless your car or doorway is nearby!"
3,"Good Product........but, not for me.","Actually, this little gadget is well made and probably appropriate for some folks. I bought it together with the wall-mount bracket from the same manufacturer. Unless you mount the wall-bracket...which is used to hang the bike by the front wheel....as low as possible to the garage floor, it could be an effort for some to secure the bike in place. Once you've accomplished that and assuming you've positioned the wall-bracket as low on your garage wall as possible, you will have to satisfy yourself with the bike protruding from the wall and quite possibly relinquishing valuable horizontal/floor space in your garage. In those cases where this might not be an issue, I think it would be worthwhile to consider. However, just won't work for me."
3,Correction to the Amazon.com review,"This is a correction to the Amazon.com review which states the Stooges did this as an answer to Duck Soup and The Great Dictator. Well, maybe to Duck Soup, but Moe Howard and the Stooges were very brave men. Moe Howard was THE FIRST American actor to portray Hitler in films. You Nazty Spy was filmed and released a full nine months before Chaplin's The Great Dictator. So give the Stooges some credit!! The Stooges were actually added to Hitler's Death List because of this and other shorts they made lampooning Hitler and the Axis powers. I collect the dvd's with 6 shorts and do not care for the colorization option. Columbia/Sony sounds messed up to have come out with this format. Sony could also work on getting the Beatle songs back to their rightful owners."
1,Can I give it less than one star?,"Oh, boy. Just when we thought ""colorized"" films were dead and buried, Columbia resurrects the corpse with an octet of Stooges shorts in that heinous format. And some of these shorts have been on DVD already! And eight shorts for $45 SRP!This is an abortion, and I plea with all Stooge fans to boycott this junk until Columbia comes to their senses."
4,Better than expected,"I wasn't sure what to expect with these DVDs, but I was happy with what I did find. The black and white versions of each film - especially ""Playing the Ponies"" - were far better than my old VHS copies. The color was also wonderful - you couldn't even tell they were filmed in BW - and you experience the Stooges from a whole new perspective. I can understand the viewpoint of the anti-colorization crowd (that it's vandalism to colorize old films) but they seemed to really do well here... and like I said, the BW versions look better than ever.My only complaint - and this is nothing new - is that four shorts per disc is far too few. There should be at least ten per disc, but I doubt we ever see that."
1,not original artists and bad recordings,"Many of the recordings in this box set are not done by the original artists. As an example, ""Acid Man"" is preformed by ""Jack frost and the Circle Jerks"", instead of the original by Jolly Roger. And how can you call this the best of acid house and not include ""Voodoo Ray"" by A Guy Called Gerald, ""Acperience 1"" by Hardfloor, or the classic ""Flow Coma"" from 808 State. Many of the recordings are dubs from vinyl, lack color and sound dull. If you're looking for a good Acid House compilation, try ""We call it Acieeed"", which is a very good mix double CD that's worth the money, or (if you can find it) get the ""Mad on Acid"" compilation."
1,Not what it claims to be.,"I ordered this item because my camera's USB cord was lost. I have a FinePix 4800. The FinePix 4800 is listed in the product's descrption but it does NOT work witht the 4800. I bought it through seller - ""Lusopc"". Big mistake. They claim no responsibility and tell me it's my fault, that I bought wrong cord."
1,Frustrating,"Admittedly this sampler is inexpensive, but I do not belive that it is worth the charge. All the selections run only about 3 minutes. In and of themselves most are very good, but it is very annoying when the cut comes. As a result, there is little satisfaction; only frustration wth the DVD and Arthaus."
5,one of the best,I have watched this over and over since the 1980s and it is one of my favorite Miss Marples with the fabulous Joan Hickson in the title role.
5,Miss Marple: 4:50 from Paddington,We watched this on line. It was a good plot. Miss Marple is refreshing and fun to watch as she solves mystery after mystery in such a common sense approach. A good family entertainment film. The plot is believable and the characters are always realistic.
5,Makes my feet soft!,"I bought me this from where I work and let me tell you this, I don't regret it at all!I'm not really the type into pampering and stuff like this but this stuff is amazing. It's easy to use; just rub it into your feet during your shower then rinse it off. After I get out and dry my feet off, they are always so soft.Not to mention it smells so good! This item is worth every penny!"
4,dated but still helpful,"Unfortunately this is the 1987 version, so no words for ""cell phone"", ""social network"" or ""PDF file"". But for most of daily life this will ehlp you find the words you need if you know a little Spanish, or use the book as a ""pointy'talky"" to communicate. And it fits in your pocket."
2,NEW JACK SKYY??,"The previous reviewer that claims that this is the best SKYY album should have his head examined.This 1989 effort from one of the 80's best disco-soul bands is just an all around miss.It seems as though they were lost musicially...it sounds like ""Let's put out a new jack swing album so that we can compete with all the Teddy Riley sounding stuff out there now"".NOT!There are a couple of decent songs on here, but the production that Randy Muller put together here just doesn't work for them.For Skyy at their best, check out their first 4 Salsoul albums--now THAT'S classic r & b at it's best.DR. FUNK"
3,Tough read for a layman,"The book claims to avoid guess work about the life of Mozart and it stands up to it. But you need to have basic knowledge of two things to appreciate this book - classical music and European history of the eighteenth century. Language is hard to grasp, and it seems to have been written for an English major. If I satified all these requirements I would have loved this book."
5,Stimulating Childs Book,I first read Sand Dune Pony 37 years ago. As a 10 year old boy it inspired me to start to read for fun. Like your first love the first book you chose to read on your own is never forgotten. A wonderful story.
5,Best Game Ever!,I Love this game! Mostly because it teaches you more about Jesus's time. I really recommend this game!
5,Best lotion smell ever!,This is my favorite lotion and I cannot get it anywhere near where I live. It has the most wonderful smell and it is not greasy or pasty at all. I love this lotion and every time I put it on I get compliments about the wonderful aroma!
2,misleading description,The blender you see in the picture is not the actual one that you receive. The HBB908 is the correct name but the blender pictured is the HB04-0032. The 908 is made out of plastic as opposed to the one in the picture which is stainless steal as the description states. I have owned the blender in the picture for many years and was buying another one for my other house. I was very dissapointed to open the box and find the cheap plastic blender. I have tried contacting amazon but it is very difficult to reach them. Look at other online stores for a proper description of the HB908 as that is the actual one you will receive.
3,a decent cheap blender,"Does a decent job with unfrozen items, but frozen items tend to jam up and require frequent manual stirring (thus creating a mess). Being that i bought it for smoothies, it makes it a bit of a headache. Blending only a few ounces at a time works, but thats a headache too. My little cuisinart chopper does a better job."
3,Good But Carefull,"For my money, make Convoy the last song you buy this for..not the first! Black Bear Road, The classified...and several others are essential...and beat the overly popularized Convoy as his best tune. That said, pick your best"
3,"Fun music for the road, (ease up on the accelerator)!","Some of my favorite songs are ""The Silverton"", ""Four Wheel Drive"",""There Won't Be No Country Music"" and ""Aurora Borealis"". Some songs give you a strong emotional response from the combination of the lyrics and the powerful music. Other songs will tickle your funny bone with the quick speak and wit of the artist."
5,CD,My husband has enjoyed this music for a long time. He even purchased one of these for a friend too.
2,"Fun music, terrrible packaging","C.W. McCall is one of those guilty pleasure listening experiences. You know its cheesy, you know its not great music, but you love it just the same. This CD, like all of his greatest hits albums, collects all the songs you need (really there are only two or three) and more.The problem is the packaging is TERRIBLE! The picture on the cover looks like it was pulled off a Web site. It is horribly pixelated and is used all over the cover. Frankly I'm suspicious that this isn't some bootlegged CD, though the sound quality is fine.So if you want to update your old cassette of C.W. McCall to CD, look for a different one, this one is a dud."
2,"Hey, Where's Crispy Critters?",No true CW MCCALL fan should stoop to buying any collection that would omit the classic singer/songwtiter/rapper's most seminal work! Looks like I'll have to pass on this one and be satisfied with CW McCall's Greatest hits. What a disappointment.
3,Okay for suspense,"2/26/04 For those of us who like knowing the plot and most of the possibilities of the ending ,so that we can just watch the ""play"" :Act by Act via ""scene after scene"" : the movie video"" The Thomas Crown Affair"" was not a disappointment...the fact that it's most ""saleable scene"": ""a mini tour of the New York Art Museum"" opened the plot (Dunaway's conversation with Bronsan during the opening credit preceded the tour)helped even more..however the movie is no ""Maltese Falcon"" or ""War and Peace"" ,so a rating of three is parallel to its merits."
3,No spark,"I think, first of all, that ""old Bolingbroke"" should stick to a review and refrain from criticizing fellow reviewers. Details do matter in filmmaking, and if I read ""Bolingbroke's"" biography right, I doubt he would appreciate playing fast and loose with his faves.That said, I was diappointed with this movie. It had some nifty spots, but not a lot of emotional punch. Renee Russo getting all gooshy over the Thomas Crowne character was hard to understand, given that she was introduced as a sexy, confident woman.A movie about intrigue should have some intrigue, and a movie about art theft (and how clever one can be) should be a lot more realistic."
2,"mildly entertaining - maybe a rental, not worth owning","I don't quite understand the rave reviews this film received. It certainly doesn't work as real drama (granted it's not intended as such), as the plot elements are far too ludicrous. Anyone with some knowledge of art and the art world will be in danger of losing their eyeballs in the back of their heads - from rolling them so much. And as escapist fantasy - the plot twists and gimmicks are rather predictable, and when they are not predictable it's only because of the astounding ludicrousness. Frankly, for escapist fun the unabashedly over-the-top Bond flicks are much better.Maybe good for a rental - I certainly don't recommend buying it."
2,Unrealistic and implausible,"I went into this movie expecting to see a witty game of cat and mouse. Instead I saw an underdeveloped story line with scene after scene of unbelievable dialogue and preposturous characters.The story should have been much more interesting, but Rene Russo's character was so rediculous in her alternating between being a tough investigator and falling for Brosnan. Her character never developed enough to believe her inner struggles as she tries to come to terms with her duty and her desires. I really enjoy Dennis Leary's work, but here too he is not allowed to develop. He is a one-dimensional cop who stands on the sidelines as Russo runs the show.Rather than be thrilled with the excitement of the chase, the implausible storyline kept pulling me out of the setting of the movie, so much that by the end I was laughing at the movie, not with it."
2,A Movie Killed by the Soundtrack from Hell,"This might've been an interesting and snappy flick if it weren't for the horribly intrusive and inappropriate soundtrack. Romantic scenes turned into beer commercials and action sequences seemed more like car ads. Awful, awful music. Think music can't ruin a movie? Check out the sequence in ""Mission To Mars"" where the spacecraft suffers a dangerous air leak. If the quiet and loopy organ music creates even the slightest air of tension check yourself, it might be embarrassment instead."
1,Take me to the Marmottan instead,"Monet's Impression, Sunrise hangs in the Musee Marmottan in Paris, far from the idiocies of this film. Brosnan hits his marks providing the viewer with a spot on parody of James Bond without his Walther PPK. Everyone seems bored in this movie, the school kids at the Metropolitan Museum where the action takes place, the cops who'd rather be shaking down wife beaters, and of course Miss Russo who looks like she wants to be anywhere else. If you want a good museum heist story stick with Topkapi. This movies is as predictable as the Met's closing time."
1,Absolutely Crummy!,"First, what ever happened to the four Romanians that Crown presumably hired to create the diversion? Second, the police are portrayed as a bunch of idiots who do nothing but sit around and drink coffee. Third, does anyone really believe that a female insurance investigator is goint to have all of the stats on a Sikorsky helicopter right on the top of her head? Fourth, the police detective unrealistically lets Russo excape with Crown because he really doesn't give a damn about a stolen Monet? Fifth, does anyone really believe that an insurance investigator is going to seize evidence illegally? Sixth, does anyone really believe that a real-life Thomas Crown would throw everything away to run away with this?? He wouldn't even do it for a Zeta-Jones, who would be much more compelling. Don't spend the money!"
1,No crown for this affair,"My wife and I used our free PPV coupon from our new cable TV serice to see ""The Thomas Crown Affair,"" and we didn't get much for our money. Pierce Brosnan thought he was still playing James Bond, and Renee Russo's nude body failed to stir any lustful, let alone romantic, impulses in either of us. The story line was none too clear, the life-style of the rich none too attractive, and the net effect was to make us wonder what gimmick these two hedonists would have to think up next if their affair were to last another week. All in all, this was ""an affair not to remember."""
4,Better with age,"Throughout the movie, I was reminded of Mr. Brosnan's performances in the television show 'Remington Steele' and felt that this helped him do such a wonderful job with the characterization of Thomas Crown. Renee Russo was a perfect choice to be the leading lady because of her age not being to out of line with her leading man. You don't have to be young to be beautiful or sexy. In addition, the plot twists left you guessing until the very end. The combination made a big impression on both my husband and myself. It is a definite must have for our video collection."
4,Escapist fare,"A very enjoyable film with plot twists, and turns. I purchased this video to add to my movie collection, because it can watched over, and over and still be entertained."
5,So HOT you'll need a cold shower to cool down!,"Steamy, sexy, erotic, intriguing - Thomas Crown Affair is one of the best movies available! Forget James Bond, Pierce Brosnan shines as the ultra-rich jewel thief who loses his heart (or does he - you have to wait until the end) to the tantalizing art-bounty-hunter, Renee Russo. Wow, talk about HOT - the love scenes (on the steps!) are quite erotic and the entire plot weaves mysterious web of cat-and-mouse. This is a wonderful film that shouldn't be missed!"
2,see the original,"Had this movie not been a remake, it might have stood up on its own. but as a remake, it cannot compare to the quality of the original. steve mcqueen plays the character cool and confidant. alone in his own world, the original thomas crown lived care free. he slept with beautiful women, played polo, flew his glider, etc...when he meets faye dunaway...he plays it cool. maintaining constant composure....in this remake, the character thomas crown is weak. he consults a psychiatrist, allows his hired accomplices to get caught, chases after rene russo like he's in high school....in the original, there's not of that. he dictated how he wanted to live and no one was going to push him around. the original is a solid movie founded on steve mcqueen's acting."
4,Interesting Remake,"I actually enjoyed this movie. I found it to be very entertaining. Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo and Denis Leary are unparalleled. As remakes go this is one of the better ones as of late. This film was made as one of Brosnan's non-Bond films during his tenure as 007. I still prefer the original."
5,Thomas Crown Affair,"""Do you want to dance, or Do you want to DANCE"". Favorite Movie, favorit music. Hot, hot, hot. Intellectually, Visually...Nice to see two characters who are so perfect together. Many times in movies I never understand the attraction or connection. But in this movie it is obvious. That is what I love about it. Two people finding the perfect person for them. The intrigue and fantasy features a plus. Take me to that island anyday and with Pierce Brosnan..oh yeah! The Art...the music and two very HOT people..Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle."
5,Guilty Pleasures,"This could be one of the eccentric secrets you hold among your friends who are poets, academics, and other nogheads who, like you, like WB Yeats over Tom Clancy. This movie is an indulgence in luxury: the fantasy protagonist who has every single item of fancy and lustily shares them with the audience. From Jaguars, skyscrapers, excellent wardrobe, private planes, a killer dress, Magritte, and a snappy score, this movie fulfills hits luxury on every level. If it were a sweater it would be of the finest cashmere, and the sex is the kind everyone aspires to, whether or not they'd admit it in say, a bohemian gathering of the literary bent.So enjoy. Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo deliver on all the levels you want them to. Curl up with chocolates and watch this movie, and revel in the sheer luxury of it all."
5,Excellent.,"Very well written. Very intelligent. Very funny. Great chemistry. Pierce Brosnan was born for this role. Though both main characters were quite sharp, I think Thomas Crown was the sharper of the two. He was always one step ahead of the game. This movie had my full attetion the whole time. There's not one boring part."
5,Awesome movie,"Pierce Brosnan was amazing, Rene Russo looked and acted wonderfully...just a really great movie!"
5,The Hotest Flick of 1999,"If you like films chalked full of steamy romance amd intrigue this film is for you! The story follows a wealthy business man/amateur art thief(Brosnan) who has nothing better to do than tackle his latest challange, whether it be a painting worth 100,000,000 dollars, or a sexy female bounty hunter (Russo) determined to get her man. The best part of the film is its twists, which are guarenteed to give you an ending you won't be expecting! Can a woman trust a theif? It isn't an Academy Award Winner, but for entertainment it is a spicy must see!"
5,The Thomas Crown Affair,Great movie. Keeps you on the edge of your chair. We had to watch it twice to get all the details. Wonderful adventure. Two thumbs up!
2,simple-minded eye candy,"Yeah, the action scenes were fantastic and the love scenes sizzled with inventiveness, but the movie as a whole was a desperate disappointment. The major drawback was the complete lack of any wit in the dialog. The characters weren't developed very well--there was a lot of exposure to their lives and lifestyles, but we never REALLY got to see who they were until the very end. Some things seemed to happen for no reason--points or conclusions were derived from what seemed to be inconsequential events. I'm bummed that I got duped into thinking it was a fabulous movie. There was one saving grace, though--at least my boyfriend and I found a film where there were leads for BOTH of us to drool over! ;)"
4,"Indulge in the luxury, and a good plot to boot.","Fantastic. In some ways, it's just a glorified version of cops-and-robbers. Pierce Brosnan is superb in the role of billionaire businessman Thomas Crown, who steals a $100 million painting just for kicks. That gets investigator Rene Russo onto his trail.. and tail. But the highlight of this film is its extravagance. Private jets, fancy dinners, corner offices, weekends in the Caribbean. Crown is, in a word, stylin'. Repeated viewings seem to have a therapeutic effect on those of us who earn annually about a third of what Crown's shoes are worth."
1,This is the worst movie I've ever seen in a theatre.,"Horrible. Easily one of the worst 20 movies I've ever seen. The only plus, if you consider such things pluses, is that whenever the film gets so ridiculously horrible you're ready to walk out, the main actress takes off her top and you get some gratuitous nudity. This movie is horrible. Anyone who rents it, let alone buys it, will feel embarressed afterwards."
1,terrible,"Someone had the gall to market this drivel as mature and intelligent. That egregious misconception is based on an inability to distinguish between wealth and brains. Very few movies I've seen rival this one for emptiness and pointlessness, and the final scene is astonishingly stupid. ""Are they kidding?"" I said to myself when I saw it. I may even have said it aloud. Do not buy or rent this film. Every dollar that goes to its makers is a slap in the face to what's left of our culture."
1,Received tw of the same DVD,Instead of getting both versions of this movie. I ended up with the same disc. Disappointing as I didn't notice it until after the return period was over.
1,Two hours wasted,An unbelivably long and boring movie. Very often I needed to press the fast forward button. A total waste of precious time. I could not believe I even finished the whole movie.
1,Should have never been made,What a waste of a story line! This bomb only needs to be watched to see how the original got it right!
5,I'm a sucker for romance and intrigue (shhh),"I am such an avid movie watcher that I rarely feel inclined to watch a movie more than once. Well, let me admit to not only having bought the DVD, but to having watched it numerous times!I love the sound track of the movie and will be doing my own remake--going Duo Discus glider riding with my significant other ;).The love scene is wonderful, the chemistry between the actors works like an MIT Lab experiment and the whole movie is simply spot on.I recommend it highly!"
4,The Thomas Crown Affair,"Excellent movie. It has something for everyone. Action, Sex, Suspence. It was a great movie and enjoyed every minute of it. I especially liked Rene Russo and Brosnan together. They enteract very well in a movie."
5,Brosnan Breaks Loose,"Pierce Brosnan heats up the screen with Rene Russo in this hot little remake. Although Bond-esque characteristics are present, Brosnan delivers a look at his corrupt and witty side as an actor. Rooting for the the bad guy has never been so fun. Russo and Brosnan are both sexy and intriguing in this passion driven film."
4,Pierce Brosnan Entrapment,"I see this film very similar to the movie ""Entrapment"" but in a One-Man-Show for Pierce Brosnan. Also this film reminds me of a TV successful Best Seller ""If tomorrow comes"".This film combines Pierce Brosnan charm & intelligince with the power and adventures of being a spoiled rich man who simply has everything!I would have rated this film 5 stars but because of Rene Russo I gave it 5 Stars!"
3,"Don't expect another ""Entrapment""","First of all, I was disappointed because I was given the impression that ""The Thomas Crown Affair"" would be similar to ""Entrapment."" Instead, it's based on a love story between Brosnan and Russo. Even though TTCA didn't offer what I expected, I was impressed by other parts of this movie. The acting was superb, Brosnan and Russo are equally great actors. The concept of the movie was also great, too. Brosnan was sexy and sleek as the rich guy who thought it was fun to steal paintings from the art museum. Other than that, I rate it a THREE, because this isn't my kind of movie."
5,Wonderful,I saw this in the theater and was very impressed. It is a very mature movie; a nice change. And it always kept you guessing. I was glad to see a movie that wasn't like all the others.
5,"Sensational, more than 5 stars are needed","Excellent acting, directing, and cinematography. Amazing twists and turns. Thomas Crown is the man us business yuppies always aspire to be, sharp, good looking, over confident, and rich. This DVD and the soundtrack are a must in your collection. Bill Conti's music is jazzie and classical. BUY BUY BUY!"
2,You already know,"As soon as I realized who was in this film, I knew how it was going to go. Its Pierce Brosnan . Playing James Bond with another name. In this movie he's a rich guy {thief} with a thing for art. Of course, he kept all of his UNCANNY charm from his Bond roles. If you wanna see Brosnan {effortlessly} make fools of EVERYONE {like he does in every movie he plays in} then this is for you. Personally I find it hard to care about a character that NEVER has it rough."
1,Thomas Crown Review,"I rented this at a video store and watched just more than half,up to the point of the ridiculous dance. Terrible movie. END"
1,Dumb and Dumber would make a better title!,"I am told this is better than the original. I think I saw the original years ago. I don't remember it being a stinker but if this remake is supposed to be better, then the original had to be awful. This picture makes no sense. The acting is OK, the story is for the feeble and that is about it."
3,Disappointing!,"Don't know whether the intention of the story was to highlight Rene Russo's breasts or to make you like an obvious criminal. The movie was totally disjointed and difficult to follow. You have an intricate plan to rob an art museum at the beginning that was nothing but a ruse so Bronson could heist a painting that we are never sure whether he wanted in the first place. He seems to like to live life on the edge and is more concerned with the challenge of doing something (betting $100,000 on a virtually impossible golf shot) than the actual result.At the start Russo is shown as a sexy super sleuth that seems to have everything figured out from the minimum of clues. I was totally in the dark as to what she actually was (an insurance investigator perhaps?). I found her annoying more than sexy throughout the movie. Overall I was very disappointed with this film."
2,Wait until public TV,"If you will wait for a couple of years, nothing will be lost. In this movie, there is no point, no storyline and as happy ending you can see a mile away. 40 minutes through the movie, I knew what the ending was. My girlfriend, apparently was not exactly interested since she was quietly sleeping 30 minutes through. Marketing people really do deserve higher pay for doing such a good job in making sure that we all get to watch it."
1,Rene Russo couldn't save it!,"I was really surprised at the positive reviews for this movie. Considering the trailers and the actors I was expecting a treat. Instead, there was only a vague nausea and a deep dissapointment. Universally, the characters were so unbelievably stupid that all the beauty and grace and costuming in the world could not salvage this film.The entire plot hinged on all involved characters doing exactly the stupidest possible thing, even if it was a matter of seconds after saying ""That would be stupid."" I am kind of happy with the fairy-tale ending. By breeding with each other it is unlikely the children will be smart enough to survive to adulthood. The idiocy could die out in one generation. In a movie universe..."
2,Shallow,"I was disappointed in this movie because as it unfolded, I never cared about the characters. The robbery plot was well thought out but the only character development had to do with how money was not enough for either of them. The only resolution to this dilemma was still superficial at best. I normally like Pierce and Renee."
4,Excelent Movie - Clever Plot,"I enojoyed this DVD very much. The plot is one of a kind. Though Rene Russo is getting old, and the DVD contains few special features, I recomend this DVD strongly."
2,Save your time--see the original,"This re-make was entirely unnecessary. The original is available on VHS and DVD. Steve McQueen and the glorious Faye Dunaway put these two pretenders to shame. Miss Dunaway remains the sex symbol for the ages, even today. Just imagine how hot she was in 1968 for the original. Pass the re-make over and see the original today!"
3,I did not want to see Russo topless,"This movie would of been better without the nudity. I thought this movie was going to be more of an action flick, at least thats what the previews seemed to protray it as. Instead in turns into an adult love affair. Disapointing."
2,Oh brother....,"This movie started out promisingly...the heist itself was carried out with some neat twists-Crown was an interesting character, but then...enter the Rene Russo character and it goes downhill. How he could stand listening to her screech and laugh like a hyena (the sex must've been really, really good!). We got bored by the time they were in the Caribbean and just wanted it to get over with."
2,Pales by comparison,"Save your time and money. There's only one Thomas Crown, and you can see him in the 1968 version. That film was a classic; this one is just a Hollywood movie. The first was tight and edgy; this one is slow and sloppy. Brosnon is still playing Bond; Russo looks middle aged and bored. So was I."
4,From a big Steve McQueen fan,"The remake is surprisingly better than the original. After seeing the original again I'm struck by how self-indulgent the movie is. The action scenes are great, but everything else seems to drag. Hard to admit, being a big Steve McQueen fan.The remake is much smarter, upbeat and focused. I love Ms Russo, too - probably more than Dunaway.All in all the remake is a better vehicle for actors. I give the remake 4 stars and the original 3."
4,Wonderful Story of Intrigue and Romance,"This story looks at Thomas Crown, a wealthy CEO type, who has become bored with his life so he decides to become an art thief in order to spice it up. Well he gets more than he bargined for when insurance investigator Catherine Banning, played by Renee Russoe, shows up to call his bluff. The two are quickly drawn into a dangerous and passionate game of cat and mouse.I love this movie for several reasons. There is no May/December romace. These two gorgeus mature creatures look as if they should date. It is also a very glamorous film with a wonderful plot line. This is a must see."
3,A commendable remake.,"The presence & chemistry of Rene Russo & Pierce Brosnan in this film is undeniable. They lift the movie to a new height. The movie started slowly but towards the end, it gets better. The nudity in the movie comes as a surprise though. The highlight of the show would definitely be how Pierce Brosnan put the original painting back in the museum despite that all cops were eyeing on him. Only when you have watched the movie you would appreciate the term, life imitates art! I wish supporting cast such as Dennis Leary gets more air-time but I suppose this Thomas Crown Affair is really a Pierce Brosnan-Rene Russo movie. Overall, a commendable action romance movie."
4,The Caper Has It,"Interestingly, it wasn't so much the affair between Rene and Pierce that grabbed me. (I thought their romance was just okay). I loved the caper. Particuarly towards the end of the movie. The last 20 minutes or so of the film makes the movie worth the price of a ticket (or dvd). Very slick, very stylish, very well done film overall. And the soundtrack is great, too."
4,"New Ending, But, Not Better","Let me say first off, I like this movie. It is cleverly written and well acted and a delight to watch. However, I still like the original film with Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway better. The plot is basically the same in both films with the exception of the ending.The writer saw fit to give the new film a fairytale ending as opposed to the more realistic ending of the first film - is this because audiences are softer now? Idon't know. But, that aside this is still a lot of fun and a great way to spend a snowy winter evening."
2,The characters were not believable.,"This movie was a major disappointment to me. I figured we'd be seeing Thomas Crown committing burglary after burglary and constantly fooling the authorities. Instead, we get two whole burglaries in the movie and Rene Russo's character, who's supposed to be assisting the police in aprehending him, fawning all over him and generally making a fool of herself. Her character was so not believable that it was ridiculous. There was no motivation for her inane actions...she fell in love with him after seeing him on a security camera for five minutes, if that. Ridiculous.I was expecting a lot more action out of this movie. There was hardly any! It was all character development that wasn't believable. I'm sorry, but this movie was pretty bad."
3,Russo is SEXY as HELL!,This is a greta Pierce Brosnan movie. He pulls out all the stops an puts on a terrific performance. Russo on the other hand couldn't act to save her life.
4,A VERY FASHIONABLE MOVIE....,"This movie was quite entertaining, even though i am not much of a pierce brosnan fan, the story was interesting, and rene russo's wardrobe was awesome! i loved and wanted almost every outfit she wore! Whoever did the costumes for this film deserves kudos! I haven't seen the first film yet, but I imagine it is probably better. This film was entertaining but not one of the best of 1999."
3,OK,"This movie is OK, but I prefer the original version with Steve McQueen. This remake is too Hollywood for me, with too many unbelievable stunts. The original was better."
3,Enjoyable Romance Caper!,"This one is enjoyable, entertaining, stylish and features great performances by the two leads. Rene Russo manages to set the screen ablaze at her 40's and steals almost every scene she's in. Pierce Brosnan breaks his 007 mold and adds the right kind of mysteriousness and sensuality to his character. Nice direction and stylish sets. But for a caper flick there's not much robbing going on, and the romance, even though the leads have chemistry, there's never any real emotion expressed. Flawed but ultimately entertaining, I enjoyed Faye Dunaway's cameo. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 6!"
4,Great Flick,"This movie was a very fun to watch, though some of the scenes I thought unnecessary. All around a great spy movie to wacth without the spys."
3,Simple but good.,"This is a good and interesting movie, there's nothing in particular that is awesome, but is a good ammout of things. Its worth it."
2,BOLLOCKS !,"I was hoping to catch Pierce Bronsan as his old role in'Remington Steele' (the only role he is good at) .. but this movie wasa disappointment. The beginning and the end of the movie were the only watchable bits, the rest of the stuff in the middle is a thin love-story about Pierce Bronson banging away on Rene Rousso (a woman that's older than my mom!) The soundtrack was the only redeeming part of this entire movie."
2,Same same same same,"OK, I thought this would be more of an action movie... ITS NOT! It is quite OK but the story unfolds slowly and there is no action what so ever. Its one of those movies you dont have to concentrate to watch... just relax have a beer and enjoy. The quality of the DVD is very good."
2,Entertaining but...,"If you liked this picture you'll love the real one. This picture, while entertaining, can't hold a candle to the one starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway!"
4,One Heck of a Remake,"The Thomas Crown Affair is a very good remake compaired to the other remakes these days. Pierce Brosnan was perfect for the role of Thomas Crown and Rene Russo plays excellant. The Thomas Crown Affair starts slow but after about 40 min. into it, it becomes exciting. It is smart how he returns the picture. It is not only a thriller but a comedy. It is good at doing both. The main reason is Dennis Leary, who plays a cop. I was suprised to find Nudity. There is just one scene. Even though it starts off slow it is still worth looking at."
3,An excellent remake.,"Hard to do a remake of a Steve McQueen movie, but Brosnan makes it work. Watch out for some very unnecessary nudity though. I might have given it 4 stars, except that the director or the studio felt the need to show naked breasts. To bad. The script and acting would have stood on their own and I believe that nudity and foul langauge limit the potential audience.So 4 stars for adults and 2 stars for families makes a 3 star movie."
3,"flawed plot, great sets and cast","This is not an exceptional adventure film, but it is a good film, carried out of oblivion by three terrific leads who all have great chemistry with each other -- Rene Russo, Pierce Brosnan and Dennis Leary -- and beautiful sets and costumes. This remake of the 1968 Steve McQueen-Faye Dunaway vehicle is actually better than the original, and features Dunaway in a recurring cameo as Crown's therapist, but a heist film is still just a heist film -- relying on its plot and cast. In this movie, the plot is sloppy but everything else is fine.DVD extras are sparse but effective -- commentary by director John McTiernan, and trailers for both the 1968 and the 1999 films. The film can be heard in English or French with English or French subtitles."
4,A stylish movie,"This movie is more of a love story. It talks about Pierce Brosnan stealing his own painting and Rene Russo has to recover this painting. A battle of wits and love sparkle between them. if you like love story, this is for you."
4,"Entertaining and fun, but predictable.","The quality of this movie was not extraordinary so the ending and many of the so called twists were very predictable. A movie like this has to be extremely satisfying, or I don't think anyone would like it. It is fun and entertaining and Pierce Brosnan is great as an ultra wealthy bored businessman. Rene Russo is very annoying at certain parts and likable a few times. She just isn't right for this part. Other than that it was worth watching but not buying."
3,"Good film, share about the trailer.....","I saw the trailer and expected to be fascinated by a feast of clever burglaries, scenes of action and a touch of romance. What was delivered was a good romantic film, with one burglary and a clever twist.This film is compared to Entrapment. I believe the two are completely different films. Entrapment IS about burglary with a touch of romance. Thomas Crown is about romance with a touch of burglary.At the end of the day, I don't think TCA is anything special or different from the rest. However, it is an enjoyable movie. I would avoid the trailer!"
5,Good moive!,"Good moive, but not great? Keeps you guessing through out the film. If you like mystery / robbery films, you'll enjoy this one! I saw if once and enjoyed it. I'd watch it again just see if I missed some stuff, but I don't think I'd buy it. Maybee, if the price was write?"
2,Rene Russo is a skinbag,"Yeah, thats right. She is a sagging old witch, and who needs to see this hag naked!"
3,Girls Go Crazy,"""Ever had one of those days"" sang Elvis, and thats exactly how I felt when I went to see this film. Taking two beautiful girls to the Virgin cinema in my BMW, I sat thorugh what was to be honest, a very good film, Not a patch on the Original, but good. I then had to put up with the girls swooning over Pierce Brosnan's Arse, then afterwards put up with them comparing my body unfavourably to his! More than a man can bear. But relax fellas, I had the last laugh... I can act!"
2,Not worth 2 hours of your life,"As much money as this movie made when it was in the theatres, I expected to at least stay awake throughout the movie. The pace was awkwardly slow and the gratuitous nudity scenes, albeit nice, were completely unecessary for the movie. Possibly a rental, but don't waste your money buying this."
2,"Good Sound, but no noise canceling","The audio quality is very good as far as I can tell and the mic seems to work well enough, but there isn't any detectable noise canceling - and I'm not sure how it could do active noice canceling without drawing power from the USB port. Also, it's described as a USB headset but instead it's connectors are for audio jacks and it comes with an extra USB adapter for them."
1,I do not recommend,"This is certainly not a good item, so I returned it. It is heavy. The material used for the earcups is somewhat rough and does not feel comfortable. The sound is good. However, even though headphones are supposedly to keep others from hearing what you are listening to, the isolation is bad and someone standing next to you can hear every word that comes through the headphone. Not a good word for this item!"
4,Great Headset,"Sennheiser has made me a long-term fan with their high quality, high value headphones, and this headset is no exception. I use it for teleconferencing via Skype and Gizmo, and the sound is flawless. Its audio reproduction is nearly as good as the dedicated Sennheiser headphones I use daily.No one has any trouble understanding me when I speak, unlike many headsets I've tried. All in all, this Senny headset is a great deal."
4,"Awesome sound, a bit uncomfortable on ear","I bought this headset to use for business calls over Skype - the type of calls where the other end is using a conference phone (a bunch of people in a room around one speaker/mic). Over my cell phone (my only other phone) I could barely hear them - lots of background noise and hard to hear the aside comments.With these phones, I can hear everything clearly! And they say I sound great too.Only, they press on one ear a bit, so after an hour or so, start to annoy, but it may just be my head/ears.I am very glad I purchased these."
2,Fine but nothing special,"I got this for traveling. My mistake - it's too bulky. Nice but I can't tell any special sound quality from other headsets I've used. So for me, overpriced for what they are."
5,Great headset!,"This is an amazing headset! It produces extremely good sound quality, has a great mic, and is very comfortable. Works very well with my x-fi xtreme gamer soundcard. The positional audio is top notch. The usb soundcard is a nice extra feature. It doesnt sound as good (or get as loud) as an x-fi but it is a step up from onboard audio.If you are looking for a headset that will not ""leak"" sound to the outside world this is not for you. It has openings behind the speakers which allows for better frequency response but it lets a lot of noise out at high volumes. Sennheiser does make a headset without the openings that is basically identical to this one though (pc 156)This is the best headset i have used in this price-range. You usually cannot find a headset this good for under $100."
2,Not the comfort I was expecting,"I really don't understand why everyone is so positive on these headphones. I own several headsets, from cheap lightweight Radio Shack specials to full-on AKG open-ear headphones I use for doing home studio work. These are one of the most uncomfortable sets of headphones I've ever encountered. They don't conform to the head well at all. They're pretty heavy for their size, and the pressure on the outer edges of the ear is very uncomfortable. If you wear glasses, they will press your ears uncomfortably against them.Sound quality is average. Nothing like my AKGs.I'm surprise, really. Maybe Sennheiser doesn't make the same quality as they used to."
1,uncomfortable,"I ordered this headset because so many people said it was so comfortable -- and the specifications say it is an ""ear cup"" form factor -- I took that along with the reviews to mean that it was an over-the-ear form -- the only kind of headset I've found comfortable to wear for hours on end. It is not -- it is an 'ear pad' -- the kind that sit on your ears, the least comfortable kind of headphones (at least for me -- apparently not for everyone).Other than that, it works great, sound quality is good, microphone is good, the usb plug is good."
3,Broke.,"It's a bit after the fact, since its been 3 years at least since it happened, but just a warning--open these up just a bit too far, and they'll POP!Now I realize this was my own blamed fault, since opening them up just far enough to put them over your ears won't strain them in the least, I still yet was mightily surprised when they broke. Sounded pretty blamed good, too, and got good reports on the mike while using it (mostly) in Lord of the Rings Online.The 3 stars is for me taking most of the blame for them breaking--I'd have rated them an easy 4 stars otherwise."
3,Not bad for the price,"""Ugh, where's the bass?"" ... seriously the bass response on these phones are bad, quite bad. But, I will give them 3 stars for convenience, durability and comfort. If u LOOOOVE music, spend a lil more and get a decent pair of headphones, but for everyday pc tasks, they're fine."
3,Not very comfortable,"After wearing these for 1-2 hours, the top of my head, as well as my ears hurt. I have to take them off at that point. Other reviews claimed these were very comfortable, and that's why I bought these. Well now I disagree, having tried them. I am returning these to find something more comfortable.Sound quality of both headphones and mic was good, but I'm not audiophile so perhaps I'm not the best judge."
3,Built for giant heads,"I mostly bought this headset for use in phone conferences when I work from home (using a regular cordless or mobile phone) and also as a PC headset. I bought jack converters for 2.5mm and 3.5mm. Have used the headset with 2 different cordless phones, my iPhone and a PC.The audio quality on the ear phones is good, the mic quality is excellent (as reported by phone conference participants) and the earphones themselves are comfortable, even on long conferences (4+ hours).Two things I'd like to see improve:-The headband is sized for giants. I'm 6' tall and 260 lbs. The headset falls of my head easily.-Since it was designed primarily as a PC gaming headset, the cord is way long for phone use. Can't dig the design, but something I didn't realize when I ordered it. So maybe the documentation should be improved.If the headband were smaller or adjustable, I'd be very happy with it."
1,Scary product sent by a scary company,"Both of the cocktail carousels I ordered from Hotsale came broken and were very cheaply made. This product is made of a plastic material not metal as the picture would indicate. Unfortunately, trying to return these defective products to Hotsale has been the most grueling customer service experience of my life! They actually said they would only give me a full refund and cover my return expenses if I withdrew my negative customer feedback on Amazon. Then, they went back on their promise. I wonder how many other customers have withdrawn their negative feedback. Be very cautious in dealing with Hotsale!"
3,Good pedal at full throttle,"I like the pedal for doing heavy metal / punk or leads at full throttle. The pedal tends to compress the signal and does not sound as good as other distortion peds when u back off the volume for cleaner rhythm and lead work. The dial names can be a bit confusing till you've gotten the hang of using it. My band does a large variety of original work. So I use the pedal on the heavier songs but I tend to rely on my amps heavy gain channel for crunchy rhythms and cleaner leads. I've been using a Fender Hot Rod deluxe with a Celsetion vintage 30 speaker. I've been combining the pedal with hi-gain channel when I want to get a lead out over top the din. It adds a nice punch without degrading the signal beyond listenable standards, which happens quite often when combing distortion peds."
1,rainy night in georgia,"Better listen to the version of the writer/singer of this song, viz.: Tony Joe White. The best ""rainy night"" ever.Brook Benton is a marvellous singer. And the nicest songs of his are on on the album Remastered Originals.Choose that one."
5,Brook Benton - Greatest Hits,Awesome songs and makes me feel like I was back at home when listening to it.
1,Greatest Songs ~ Brook Benton,"This is not Brook Benton sining on this recording. The imposter is good but can not resonate like Brook Benton. If your looking for the real thing, do not by this recording."
2,Brook's mediocre selections,"Wow! Just enough to give to someone else. He was great,but this selection doesn't have enough of the goodies. As a woman in her mid seventies, I know what he could do."
2,White Residue/ Sticky,"I hate these types of deodorants/anti-antiperspirants. Leaves a white residue on clothes and is also very sticky on your skin. Makes me want to run back home, throw my clothes in the washer and take a shower to get this sticky thing off my armpits."
5,Closetmaid Shelving Brackets,"I purchased several dozen of these brackets for the purpose of installing an ADJUSTABLE shelving system in one of my closets. Each bracket was about $3.15 while HomeDepot charged $4.57 each. This represented a significant savings. I was pleased that the transaction went without any problems. For me, one out of every 3 or 4 online purchases seem to result in catastrophe, leading me to believe that online sales will eventually fall as people get fed up with being burned.I will purchase many more brackets again in the future from this seller.Thank you,Ken"
1,JUNK!,"If these aren't broken before you wrestle them onto a mattress, you should be a surgeon!! We bought two of these mattress covers, and I have to say they are the single lowest quality items I have purchased for any use ever. The zippers both broke instantly. The cheap plastic tore. Really not worth a dime. AVOID."
4,Very nice,The story is very nice and the illustrations are beautiful! My daughter's name is also Julianna and it isn't a very common name. I gave this book to her for her 6th birthday and she loved it! She thought that it was written for her.
5,Outstanding story! Beautiful pictures!,This has quickly become a favorite story of my 3 1/2 year old daughter. I highly recommend it!
3,A solid effort,"Not as good as the previous ""Perfect strangers"" but not at all as bad as many claim. It seems Ritchie Blackmore got his way and made Deep Purple sound more like Rainbow on these rather popish songs. The quality of the material is not top class, although some tunes are rather good like ""Bad attitude"" and ""Call of the wild"". But the real treat is ""Mitzi Dupree"" - a song the stubborn Blackmore didn't like at all which resulted in the fact that they had to include the demo version (Blackmore refused to record it again)."
3,Okay 80's Purple,"An American review from a non-Russian here (imagine that). This record is okay. If you like the classic Purple lineup, you will find plenty to enjoy. On the whole the album is weaker than ""Perfect Strangers"", but ""The Spanish Archer"" is better than anything on ""Strangers""--Blackmore is totally smoking. Gillan's ""Mitzi Dupree"" is entertaining in an ""Anyone's Daughter"" sort of way (really like ""Puget Sound"" if you are familiar with his solo career) and ""Black & White"" has some good harmonica. I really like ""Bad Attitude"", too. Great Gillan lyrics on that one and some cool Jon Lord keyboards at the end. However, most of the rest is not too memorable."
4,Deep Purple chooses fun over heavy,"While not as heavy or rockin' as ""Perfect Strangers"" or ""The Battle Rages On"", this album is still a pretty good Deep Purple one. The 80's run of the band sounds different from the early 70's days (in keeping with the times), but it's good in its own way. Although this album seems to be their foray into more of a Van Halenesque pop direction, it's still got some nice guitar riffage and energy, and Gillan's lyrics and vocals work well with a sense of fun and tongue-in-cheek. Even if it's Deep Purple ""lite"", it's a good one - there's not a song on it I don't like, and I'll still take it over any 80's American hair metal anyday."
4,A follow up to a classic...not bad.,"No question, ""Perfect Strangers"" is a Deep Purple classic. ""The House of Blue Light"" was the follow up. Not all the songs are classic Purple, or even in the vein of ""Perfect Strangers,"" but as a whole the album is pretty solid. For me, Bad Attitude, Strangeways, Mitzie Dupree, and Dead or Alive are the highlights of this album. Gillan's vocal work is, for the most part, excellent, especially on Mitzie Dupree. The Unwritten Law could have been a good song if the vocals weren't incredibly...stupid, for lack of a better word. The tensions between Gillan and Blackmore resulted in some pretty darn good guitar playing from Ritchie (Dead or Alive) and vocals from Ian trying to bridge the gap (""...why don't we call it a day before we call it a nightmare, darlin'?"") or lashing out (""...you think I'm chained up, but I'm just tied down""). Overall, ""The House of Blue Light"" is a consistent, if sometimes unspectacular, album."
3,Not what you expect from purple.,"Deep purple is my favorite band of all time but this is one of their weakest efforts ever.It is not terrible but as I said not what you expect from some of the greatest rock heros of all time.Bad Attitude, Hard Loving Woman and Mitzi Dupree definately make it worth having but outside of that not so much .I will go as far to say that most of there post Blackmore era is even better than this . This is the weakest of the Mk. 2 era."
2,...weak album w/one really good song...,"...Poor record...VERY poorly recored...no life or urgency to the material at all...EXCEPT for 'The Spanish Archer,'...This song is like a run-away train that threatens to fly of the rails at any moment...great, great guitar work and gillan is wailing on that cut...Buy it cheap for that one song"
2,all that's left: the sound and the fury,"Just like the fan from NJ, I moved into the US from Russia (I will not be surprised if most of the Purple fans in the US are Russians) and I bought this one in the mid 80s too-what a big disappointment it was! I would rank ""House"" among the worst Purple albums, along with ""Come Taste the Band"" and ""The Battle..."" The point is, there is not much MUSIC left. Bring together all the rattling fill-ins from Purple & friends, like Whitesnake's ""Bloody Mary"" or Rainbow's ""Do You Close Your Eyes"" and you will get this totally faceless album. I know that many will disagree, but I'd rather listen to good pop than to bad rock. Their next album, ""Slaves and Masters"", was bashed by Purple fans, but I think it was much better than both the ""House..."" and their previous effort, ""Perfect Strangers"". It is really unfortunate that ""S & M"" is so hard to find now."
1,Do not waste your money!,"This may be one of the worst albums ever made. The only thing good about this record is that it eventually ends. Every single song on it is a miserable experience devoid of melody. After I purchased this piece of trash I could only say to myself ""this cd cost me two hours of my pay"". After that I vowed to save anyone else from making the same mistake. Do yourself a favor and buy ""Perfect Strangers"" and avoid making eye contact with this waste of plastic. You will only loose an hour of your life for nothing."
5,One of Purple's best albums ever,This album rocks! I cannot understand why it has been overlooked by so many fans. Virtually every song is a hit. Gillan has his finest hour on this album. This album ranks within the top five Purple albums ever. The one bad thing that can be said about it is that Jon Lord focuses a bit too much on the synth instead of the Hammond. But it's definitley worth five stars!
5,A really great cd,"I think a very underrated cd. In my opinion I think its one ofDeep Purple best albums. From the song Bad Attitude to Dead or Alive its an excellent album but remember its my opinion. Good luck trying to find this cd new or for that matter used in stores, I could find anywhere else execpt for Amazon. Keep on rocking Deep Purple and everybody else keep on rocking to."
1,HOBL - A Flawed Remaster,"When HOBL was released in the '80's there were two versions. The CD featured a full length ""Strangeways"" and the vinyl LP a cut down ""Strangeways"".On this remaster, the record company got it WRONG. Yes, they bring you the cut down LP version.This album is way better than Perfect Strangers, which was a rather flat attempt to be another Machinehead. Instead HOBL adds new dimensions to the Purple sound. It is a hard rock album AND a sophisticated peice of music.I encourage you to go find a copy of the original CD and leave this remaster turkey alone."
4,The House of Blue Light,"Band Personnell:Ian Gillan - Vocals and CongaRitchie Blackmore - GuitarsRoger Glover - Bass and SynthesizersIan Paice - DrumsJon Lord - KeyboardsThis album tried to fit in the late 80's style, synths and conga are included, it doesn't have as much highlights as ""Perfect Strangers"", the opening track ""Bad Attitude"" is maybe the best track on the entire album, but it sure has other good songs aswell."
2,VERY UNEVEN,"This album is very uneve, it's not in accord with Purple's quality. Anyway, there we have GIllan's amazing voice and Blackmore's unique guitar sound. But the songs are weak, that's the problem."
2,One and a half stars for Spanish Archer . . . .,"I'm not sure what DP was trying to be on this effort, but it didn't work. Maybe they weren't trying too hard to be anything at all, which would explain the insipid songwriting and mostly forgettable performances.The opening two tracks, ""Bad Attitude"" and ""Unwritten Law"", are decent -- no memorable riffs or great performances, but listenable. ""The Spanish Archer,"" featuring some interesting guitar work by RB, is far better than that. The rest are hardly worth mentioning. Songs like ""Dead or Alive"" and ""Mad Dog"" have plenty of energy but no life. (The blue lights are on but nobody's home?) Overall, these songs sound almost like each musician was recorded separately and the tracks were later mixed.""Perfect Strangers,"" which preceded this, is one of Deep Purple's best albums, and ""The Battle Rages On,"" which came after, is very good. As far as ""The House of Blue Light"" goes, get ""Spanish Archer"" for your MP3 player and then close the door."
4,Improved sound over the Polydor/PolyGram double disc?,"Before I pop for another version of this (I still have my vinyl copy from 35 years ago and my 20 odd year old PolyGram double disc version), is this Korean import of In Concert remasatered and sound better then my Polydor/PolyGram late 1980's double disc version? Does anyone own both and care to comment??"
5,Simply Superb!,"Eric Clapton at his best! An outstanding performance! Is it possible better? My favorite songs are Why does love got to be so sad, Presence of the Lord and Let it Rain, wich I'm hearing it now, and I think it's fantastic the way Jim Gordon plays the drums. Fantastic!!!"
4,Great Guitar Work,"Even though I liked this version of Dominos live, There was another version available on vinyl in the 70's. On the Let it rain and Love got to be so sad cuts, The previous versions were much better cuts taken from another show. Maybe the labels can tell us why the cuts were changed on this version. All other cuts are the same as the old vinyl version."
1,$42.00 for this ???,"I remember when I bought this album back in '73 . I came home and played it and called the record store to see if I could return it. They asked why? and I said because I don't like it. I stll don't. I gave it one star because I couldn't give it less, save your money for a good recording."
4,Quality Clapton Songs with the dominoes,"Derek and the dominoes go generally underappreciated as far as Eric Clapton bands go. The song they are most know for playing, Layla, is always attributed as a Clapton song. But Derek and the Dominoes was a great collaberation between Clapton and a bunch of good ol' boys.This album does not let the listener down. It throws down great clapton solo's and jams, as well as letting the listener get the feel for the band as well. The in the presence of the lord on this album is top-notch, with Clapton really cranking it outThis album is great, and worth every dollar. You's be buying it now"
5,This is the best book I've ever read!,"When I read this book, it felt like I was actually there with him. It had such good detail and it was a good way to learn about what you have to go through when you are shot down. It also does a great job of explaining about how to get into the Air Force and how hard he tried. I would like to be like Scott O'Grady when I grow up."
4,Where have all our heroes gone?,"I read this book about a year ago. I am currently re-reading it. This time, I'm reading it aloud to my 7- and 4-year old sons. Capt. O'Grady's story is not only a captivating adventure for the boys, it is a description of a man of integrity, faith in God, and strong character. Capt. O'Grady's perserverence, integrity, and stamina are exemplary"
4,An Amazing Story,"This book was given to me for Christmas years ago, and I still read it at least one time a year. Aircraft enthusiasts will love this. O'Grady gives an incredible personal account, and the story is not all ""Apocalypse Now."" He includes his own story with the military, creating an interesting book."
4,Kids Sing Okay,I thought most of the songs were nice. There were a couple of songs that the singer's voice seemed to crack. I was disappointed that Amazing Graze was instrumental (since it was not marked as such).
2,Hoo Hung Wu,"This is the third mystery that we have done with this company and obviously, we enjoyed the others. This particular one however, was boring...we didn't even finish the game. The characters were too hard to follow and there was so little in the way of surprises in the clues. The costumes were difficult to come up with. We have had a different group of people each time and I was truly embarassed to have invited these people to such a boring evening. Get the Western one instead!!"
3,Better than the first one...,"For Corky Corcoran, putting her sister Bobbi's untimely death behind her is proving to be a job of work, thanks to that pesky Evil lurking around Shadyside.The second book in R. L. Stine's Fear Street Cheerleaders series stands miles above its predecessor. The writing is cleaner, the characters better developed, the plot tighter and more deftly executed. And the body count is higher, too. Get ready to say goodbye to a couple of series regulars, and to make the cliffhanger ending easier to digest, make sure you have the third installment onhand.The First Evil (Fear Street Cheerleaders, No. 1)Second Evil (Fear Street: Cheerleaders)The Third Evil (Fear Street Cheerleaders, No. 3)Cheerleaders: The New Evil (Fear Street Super Chillers, No. 7)Cheerleaders: The Evil Lives (Fear Street Super Chillers, No. 13)The Awakening Evil (Fear Street, No. 10)"
3,Could've Been Better!,This book was definately not as good as the other books in the series. The book seemed kind of slow going or wasn't that exciting like the other ones.
3,"Not as good as the first, but still good.",This book was one of the best I've ever read! I reccomend reading all five one after the other!
5,The Second Evil,"The Second Evil is in the Fear Street Cheerleaders Saga. This isthe second book in the series but you don't need to read the first oneto get into the second one because they have completely different plots.And if you like this one, there is a third one The Third Evil.This is a book about a group of seniors at Shady Side High.When Corky's sister Bobbi dies, Corky mourns at Bobbi's grave everyday. But one day she encounters an evil spirit and she fights it. Shethinks she killed it, but the terror has only started. When all her friendsstart acting weird, she knows the spirit has gotten in someone's body butwho?This is a young adult book with some details that may not besuitable for younger readers. There were a lot of gross/gruesomedetails that tell about how people got murdered.So mainly seventh and eighth graders should read this book."
4,A Sad Tale,"Mary Driscoll's tale is a sad one indeed. She leaves her parents to go to America. As her parents starve she tries to save money for them. So they may travel to America to meet her and her sister. Mary works in a factory and instantly makes friends with another worker.I have only read two book in the Dear America series so far, one in the Princess series and this one. It seems to me that the theme is to make the story heartbreaking and terrible to go through to make an interesting story. Not to mention how it ends for dear Mary. I understand that this was probably realistic for some who came over during the Potato Famine and because some of my family did just that I was interested in the story even though it is very dark.I would say that it was an interesting read but at some times annoying because of the accent, which I don't know if it was correctly done, Mary spoke in. Something about the way she spoke did not seem believable yet the story did seem so other wise."
2,It made me cry,This book was sad.I made me cry at the end of the book.Girls grab your tissues this book gave me no joy at all.No no no no!!!!!!!!!!
4,"Not the best, but still great","This book is pretty interesting.It's about Mary Driscoll, who's an Irish girl trying to escape a life of starvation and go to the land where ""everyone dresses in red and the streets are paved with gold"".She finally ends up in America, where she gets a job working in a mill. The conditions are horrible, but at least it's money to save up to bring her parents to America as well.She makes friends, witnesses a few tragedies, and hears that her parents have died. So instead of using the money to bring them to America as she had planned, she uses it to rescue a friend from jail who's been wrongfully accused.The epilogue is very thorough in telling what happened to everyone in the story.But because I have read a few books that I enjoyed more, I'm giving it a 4 star rating."
4,A bonus if you're interested in diaries,"Mary Driscoll leaves her home in Ireland during the years of the potato famine to join her aunt and sister in Lowell, Massachusetts. Arriving, she lives with her aunt while working in the mills where she hopes to earn enough money so she could send for her parents who are still back in Ireland.So Far From Home gives a look into what it might have been like for a young Irish girl who comes to American during the famine and works in the mills. It also shows how there were those who were against the Irish and those who did not want to hire them."
5,A Perfect Book!,Mary Driscoll's diary was very real and showed how Americans had so much prejudice to the Irish.It had one sad part that explained her actions for Sean.It showed how some American were different toward the Irish immigrants.A very fasinating book!
3,a book to read,"""so far from home"" is about a 13 year old girl who travels to america from irland. while she is their she works in sweat shop to earn money for he rpearrents so they can come to. this book also shows how tough the irish had it back then and how mistreated they were by the yankeesi would recemend this book becuase it is intresting looking at thing from the way those poeople lived back then."

2,not this transfer,"The Everest label, noted, in the early stereo LP days, for its state-of-the-art Hi-Fi status and its recordings made on 35 mm film, has had a complex and chequered history that is too long to recount here. But one thing is sure: if you want Everest reissues on CD, you need to go to the original batch under the Everest label (released in the mid-1990s), not to these nth generation transfers from Bescol. And, for reasons stated in my review of the Everest's CD reissue (Symphony 9), this version of Mahler's 9th by Leopold Ludwig is very much worth knowing."

3,"Better than the rest, but not perfect...","I have a 75 pound Lab mix that went through her first two retractable leashes pretty quickly - not so much chewing them, but just yanking on them until the retractor mechanism would give up.The Flexi 3 Long was the only one to last 2+ years. The extra length really helps, because she rarely hits the end. But eventually, the retractor mechanism doesn't retract the leash after a few minutes, and I'm kind of disappointed that I can't seem to open the leash and either lubricate the bearing or adjust the tension springs. But maybe that's my shortcoming, and not the leash's.But at least it's better than the competition, and I feel I've gotten my money's worth, so I'll buy another. I guess in the end, that's about all I could ask for - nothing for large dogs is truly indestructible, I suppose."
3,Metaphors? I guess. Technically.,"There's a famous story of Milton Erickson's treatment of a client with enuresis. The kid had an interest in archery and Dr. Erickson talked to him about the muscular coordination involved in drawing a bow. He never mentioned ""bed wetting"" but the metaphor of archery was enough to conquer the problem. Now that's my idea of the use of metaphors.The ""metaphors"" in this book are a lot less subtle. In fact, they're utterly transparent. For example, to deal with bed wetting, the book offers a story about an animal who is experiencing bed wetting and uses hypnotic techniques to conquer it. Fear of the dark? A story about a gorilla who's afraid of the dark and uses hypnotic techniques to conquer it. In fact for every problem presented, the ""metaphorical"" tale simply replaces the child with an animal and describes a hypnotic method to solve it.On a positive note, it's nicely illustrated."
5,Granddaughters favorite,My granddaughter loves Eloise. Springtime is one of her favorites.She cannot wait until the next one becomes available. Watches themover and over
5,my girl loves this eloise movie!,"We bought this to replace a lost library copy, but soon found the library's copy. Now it will be a Christmas gift for my daughter. She loves the movie. It was a great price at $7.50. She watches it over and over!"
3,"I wanted the Kaspian from ""In the Land of Winter"" back","I missed the child Kaspian From ""In the Land of Winter"" with the chocolate mint eyes in Richard Grant's latest book ""Kaspian Lost"". Maybe I'm missing the point and the characters that resurface in various Richard Grant works are not supposed to carry a clear growth progression. It was hard to see the little boy Kaspian, who had such a clear idea of right and wrong and religious zealotry (in ""In the Land of Winter"") turn into such a misguided adolescent. The book stalled in parts, which all of Richard Grants books do, but ""Kaspian Lost"" lost the magic that Tex and Molly were existing in and that we were led to believe in the previous book that Kaspian embodied. I enjoyed the book but I missed the magic."
5,Can't line dry without these!,"I have two of these hung in my laundry room. I line dry a lot of things (all our wool socks, anything polyester, wool diaper covers, and all of my handknit items). For a mom like me this is a very handy tool! I love them!"
4,Happy with my Hanger!!,"I had been looking for one of these for several months. I have something similar that is losing it's clothes pins and since I use it every week when I do laundry, I was eager to find a replacement. This one is larger and has more pins, than my old one, so I can hang more delicates. I have no complaints with the quality or the sturdiness of it. If I had a complaint, if would be the shape. My old one is round and rotates from its central hanger. I also thought it was a little pricey for what it is, but if this one lasts as long as my old one, I will get my money's worth ."
1,Forget it - Its just a book of photos.,"Since things have heated up in Afghanistan, I have been reading everything that I can find on both the Taliban and the Soviet expericence in Afghanistan. I purchased this book as part of my sweep. It is hardly more than a picture book. There are perhaps 1,000 words in an opening text and perhaps 100 photos. Some of the photos are interesting, some are not, and some are obvious fakes or Soviet era propaganda. The day after I recevied the book, I donated it to the local library. Save your money and buy something else."
2,Not the best out there,"This is the third How to Host a Murder game I have participated in, and by far not the most enjoyable. The facts were vaque, and the motives unclear. When it came to making accusations, every character was a fair guess. It was fun, and my guests had a good time, but as far as the plot went, there are better ones. I suggest The Maiming of the Shrew. Outright halirity..."
4,Very fun evening!,"My husband and our friends really enjoyed this murder mystery dinner pasrty set. We have done others in the past, and this one has been the best so far. After reading many of the negative reviews, I feel that those players must have seriously lacked creativity! It will be as much fun as you put into it. If you dress up, try to use accents and decorate, you will have a blast!!!"
2,Nothing in terms of actual methods ....,I was looking for some actual methods to increase interaction between siblings - one on the spectrum-- there are only generalities all through the book
3,Parking Lot Picker series better,"I have three volumes from Kaufman's ""Bluegrass Guitar Solos Every Parking Lot Picker Should Know"" series. I like to be able to learn progressively more difficult versions of the same song, which this volume does not have. Also, I use ""Amazing X"" software with the Parking Lot Picker series, which allows me to slow down each cut without losing pitch, so I can slow down and speed up progressively to learn each level. THIS book only has two speed versions--and the ""slow"" one is NOT slow. I've been using Kaufman's books (which are excellent overall) for the last two years, and I had a hard time keeping up with the slow version of this book/CD combo. If you are just beginning to learn bluegrass guitar, definitely begin with the Parking Lot Picker series. They are more versatile than this volume, and you'll get more mileage from them than this one."
2,This book alone is not enough.,"I just took the CLEP exam today and I scored a 47. You need 50 to pass so I obviously did not get that. I read through the material of this book twice and took both practice exams twice. I scored a 75 on both practice exams. The book fooled me into thinking I was ready. It just does not go into enough detail, which is exactly what the CLEP asks for. The test is very detailed. I don't know what I would recommend...maybe a college textbook or something instead. I definitely learned from this book but I didn't pass."
1,Waste of money and time,"Despite the glowing reviews from others, this book was of little or no value in preparing for the CLEP exam. The format of the questions was not the same (the study guide had zero long quotations to read and answer questions about, but the real exam had many) and the material covered was not remotely distributed the same way. The bulk of the material covered in the study guide was mentioned little or not at all on the exam; the exam contained many many many questions about things that were mentioned little or not at all in the book. Perhaps the CLEP test people have moved into a new mode to outsmart the study guide publishers, but whatever the reason, the study guide will not prepare you to pass this exam."
1,Did not live up to name,"Book did not live up to expectancies. I read through entire book as well as took both pre-tests and went over correct answers for any information I may have missed. Not only did this book not prepare you for the true clep, it disallusioned me into believing that I was more prepared. However, upon receiving a 42, I realize that is not the case. I do know the book is an aid, however the questions asked on the test have hardly any relevance to what information/questions provided by the book. Save your time and money."
4,It can work...,"This book is good for people who are unfamiliar with the CLEP American History topics. It is a good basis for study because it touches upon the main subjects included on the test. I was able to pass the test, but I supplimented my study with an online source that was much more comprehensive. The book does jump around so it is neccessary to either know the timeline of our history or study that separately. This book is definitely a good place to start, because it narrows the focus of what to study in order to be prepared for the CLEP."
2,Only good for the practice test,"The review that the book does is just too general and does not have enough specifics for you to be successful. I would recommend seeking out other materials to help you study, only the practice tests are good for preparing."
3,good,"The book is good, but you need to memorize every single work in there to pass on the exam. I failed :(Its a hard test..."
2,A supplemental study material for the CLEP US History II Exam,"This book had very little information that was actually on my version of the CLEP test--If I hadn't supplemented the information with other sources I might have failed. To study for the CLEP History II exam you will need to know a bunch of worthless quotes (and their authors) and information like ""What river was Mark Twain a river boat captain on?"" Definitely use this as a supplement to a history book, because the only thing this book does well is frame domestic policy (which constituted very little of my exam). The book does include two practice exams that make learning easier, but I reiterate, this should not be your only study material."
1,Sent the Wrong Item,"They sent the Wrong Item!I ordered the review book for CLEP History of the United States II w/ CD (REA), but instead received the CLEP General Exams book.I have ordered a number of books from amazon.com, and have never had this problem before. I'm still trying to return the book for a full refund."
5,An Inspiring Treasure from Yesteryear,"I purchased this work of art sometime in the mid 80's, as a teenager who had been captivated by seeing Star Wars in the theater years before. When I wasn't writing NASA for the latest ""technical details"" about the space shuttle, I was engrossed in this book. As a rather large book (10.5"" x 12.25""), it sits towering on the shelf, often reminding me of how much I enjoyed seeing the dawn of technology, and the pioneering work these magicians undertook as they changed the world with pixels and puppets."
1,don't waste your time,"take it from someone who knows--when kranicki gets beyond willie mosconi's page or two, this book, with its esoteric aiming routines, is malarkey and lots of it."
3,I'll take a pass. . .,"It may come to shock to you that, after reading these wonderful reviews, I did not enjoy this book. Although, I can see how it possibly be helpful to some, I personally thought it over-analysed the aiming process one needs to go through. If you are an experianced player who is satisfyed with the way they aim, pass on this book and use your money/effort/time to invest in something else. On the other hand, if you are just starting out, or an intermediate player who wants to learn how to aim properly, by all means get this book. However, this book requires ample work and concentration on your part for his methods to take effect.P.S.Be prepared for a dry read. . ."
5,The book that is ahead of its time!,"This book has not only showed me knew things (Especially the subtleties hidden from the average shooting eye) but has verified the things which I learned but could not explain. This is not a common book. By the way, this is the ONLY BOOK EVER TO BE ENDORSED BY THE GREATEST NAME IN POOL --MOSCONI!!"
2,missing peices,"I ordered this tackle box plus kit as a birthday gift, to be shipped directly to thier home. They recieved the tackle box, but it was completly empty! The company that shipped the box did respond quickly to my email regaurding the problem, but it was been 3wks and they still have not recieved the kit that goes with the box...I gave this product 2 stars because my friend said that the tackle box was sturdy and easy to use....but if you want to get everything that you paid for, I would not buy this product."
1,disappointed with this tackle box,"I was disappointed with this tackle box. The ""62 Piece tackle"" was not as expected and rather ""junky"". I would have been better going to Gander Mountain, spending probably about the same amount of money, (with the box and shipping total), and gotten a better product."
1,Please Be Careful,"Please Note: Although this tackle box is listed in the Toys & Games Department, it is NOT A TOY! It comes with very sharp, real fishing hooks, a small, metal, knife-like tool (also sharp) and other actual fishing items, that can harm a young child. These items should not be used for playing. They are for a real fisherman, who knows how to handle the objects inside. This tackle box should be offered in Amazon's Sports & Outdoors Department, instead of their Toys & Games Department."
2,"Product is ""ok""","If you are looking for ""Olympic quality"" style and sound for national anthems, this product is not what you are after.Very vanilla arrangements with no real ""big sound"" inspiration usually associated with symphony recordings of anthems.This is straight from the sheet music and played as is - with no artistic creativity whatsoever.Add to that a very annoying drum roll which is included throughout many anthems (far more pronounced than traditional ruffles), and essentially wrecks the American anthem.The collection is good if you are simply curious about what some foreign anthems sound like, or are trying to learn a specific anthem in order to play it yourself.However, should you be searching for listening enjoyment of a national anthem orchestral compilation, skip this CD."
5,An engaging and mood-capturing translation of a wonderful work.,"This version of The Bacchae is not only beautiful, but the printing of the words of the chorus and the style and breaks in the lines of the text catch a perfect mood and speed as well as rhythm. The pages have the text spaced nicely, and it seems to breeze quickly and chaotically because of the rate that the pages need to be turned. In this way a mood is captured that is not always seen in translations of ancient texts. Besides that, it is a compelling tragedy that raises many questions."
5,Fox is back,"VFP 7.0 has dramatically improved its IDE, including an awesome data driven implementation of Intellisense that is completely customizable, making it one of the best available. But thats not all, improved speed, stability, and XML support, along with the long list of language enhancements suggested by VFP users add up to make this one of the most powerful and easy to use Database tools available."
5,The best yet!,"I have been working in FoxPro and Visual FoxPro for 7 years now. With each upgrade, FoxPro has only gotten better. With Web Service, IntelliSense, XML, and OLE DB, this is the best yet! I've only been working with for a few days now, but I can't wait to find out what lies in store for me. It's a programmer's dream come true."
2,Cliche ridden shredder angst,"I recently picked up an album of Tony,Sheehan and Chambers and it was the bomb.So going through the bins over at Rasputin's,I saw this one on sale and said why not.Gave it a run through on my drive home and the term that came to mind was Yngwie!Dude a bad jerri curl and sounding like Yngwie is not a good way to make a classic album.I give kudo's for the chops of all the players involved,but this is just cliche shredding at it's worst.Dated sounding and aimed at the shredder wannabe's.If you like this style,go for it,but this is not a keeper for me."
1,Deceptive,"This miniscule book measures 2 1/2 inches by 3 1/2 inches. A person needs a magnifying glass to even read it. It has 30 pages of text and pictures, but if it were put in a normal-sized book it would add up to maybe three or four pages. That's it! The previous reviewer was right. This book is little more than a typical prize coming out of a box of ""Cracker Jacks."" I would strongly urge anyone interested in Calamity Jane to look for a version of her autobiography from a different publisher."
1,a complete ripoff,"This is the biggest ripoff I have ever encountered on the web . I shall NEVER BUY anything else from Amazom ,when I opened the package I thought that it was some sort of joke ,it was .the joke is on me"
3,Seiko Watch,This watch was delivered on time. I love the looks of this watch and would have given it 5 stars but the back of the face had numerous scratches on it. The scratches were deep. Looks like someone tried to remove the back and ended up scratching it. The front side is not scratched. I decided to keep it even though I don't like paying full price for a damaged product.
3,"Watch good for young girls, minature watch for adults","This watch is gorgeous on the website; however I was greatly surprised to see it in person. It is a minaturized version of an adult watch. The faceplate and dials were so tiny, it was almost unreadable. It would be perfect for a young girl or very small framed teen; definitely not an adult sized watch. So disappointed as it is a beautiful watch, just needs to be adult sized."
5,Lockman,"I purchased this Seiko watch for my wife for Christmas. She usually does not wear a watch, but she wears this one.She loves the look of the watch, it is for both casual and dressed up wear. I have owned Seiko watches for manyyears and they have always worked and looked great. She is very happy with this watch and of course that makesme happy too. The delivery was very fast and since it was delivered to our house, there was no standing in a longline or driving around."
5,Go and buy this movie when the price hits reasonable!!,"I don't know why the other critics on this are so tough ones, I'd give it a 10 stars if possible. My words are that you'll be forced to the edge of your seat throughtout the film, for Brian De Palma not only succeeded in creating a most intense hard-core thriller but also introduced those two all the time splended actors into a genius blend of their roles, which I guess everyone would've waited long enough otherwise, but also the super cammera works in arena shots are by no means mismatch to it. This isn't a typical 'whodunit'. This is a human drama as well, about the ones 'whose veins are filled with money, who'll change the names to protect the guilty', about to be redeemed."
5,"A guy film, I guess","I watched this with my girlfriend last night. I loved it & she was less enthused.Cage goes way over the top in this one. If you're a fan of ol' Nick, ya gotta see this movie."
2,Predictable But Artsy,"Within the first 10 minutes, I could see the evil culprits. Although that was the case for me, it may not be the case for everyone. The flashbacks made the movie interesting and the use of cameras in odd places was effective and enjoyable. I really didn't care for the ending but if I tell you why it will give away the ending. Sorry"
4,A different kind of thriller,"Okay so the majority of critics didn't really go for this one. Why? Cause it's different. This isn't a slam-bang action Brukhiemer film, nor is it an suspenseful-scary thriller. The film tries to be both in a way at once. It is sort of a stylish representation of an audience looking through a hidden camara. The audience acts as a jury by being expsed to all different views of different people that all converge in one situation. I think people watched it hoping for action ,they didn't get it, it's action not just the type like Con-air and the Rock, people wanted suspense, but this aint no teen-horror flick. This is a crime-thriller that throws in brilliant camara work and acting. This movie is pretty good. Forget that what the critics said, watch it and don't expect BOOM!!! Rat-tat-tat!!!!!Hasta-vista-baby. The movie is finely executed , but was seriously overlooked by audience and critics alike. Don't make the same mistake."
2,TOO SHORT,"Needed more info and storyline. I was predicting a tasteful long Cage flick and got a semi ok short swiftly solved murder mystery. Brian De Palma fans may like this movie. Some people who enjoy direct, to the point movies that run 1 hour an 32 minutes, this is your flick."
4,"great film, needs a special edition though","Great film, good cast, but it was the lack of special features that disapointed me. All it has was the original theatrical trailer."
3,"Great start, but has a ridiculous ending","This started off as a very interesting suspense film. I especially liked how the showed the same murder scene from various people's points of view. The characters were handled perfectly, because you never quite knew if they were the villian or not. By the third act however, it all fell apart. The two biggest problems were that the villian was revealed too early and the climax was horrible. What made this movie intriguing and suspenseful was wondering who the villian was, and once that was given away, the movie began to turn into a run-of-the-mill action flick. If we were left wondering until the final scene, it would of kept me more interested. The second problem was that the final scene was completely ridiculous. I don't want to give anything away, but this ending is such a ludicrious freak occurance it nearly ruined the film."
3,A high intesity thriller,"Nickals Cage gives a spattacklere prformence. A crooked cop whitness a murder in a boxing rink. In all of his confustion, he finds out that one of his best friends is in an the murder. See the movie to see if he escapes alive...."
4,Cage Is outstanding in this film!,"A real hard edge stylish conspiracy thriller that keeps you going all the way from start to finnish. Nicolas Cage in one of his best roles plays crooked Atlantic City cop Rick Santro, who is into just about anything illiegal is caught in the middle of an assaenation attempt of the defense minister during a heavyweight title boxing match. At the same time he relaizes the fight is a fix and has something to do with the murder. De Palma's visual teqnique is used here the same way it was usedin another Conspracy thriller ""BLOW OUT"" But Cage's captivating performaces is what makes this film worth watching even when he's at his most annyoning self he still maneges never going over the top. Slowed down a bit during the middle of the film to allow the storyline to be understood by the viewer and reached a satisfying conclusion."
4,Outstanding!,"A great addition to my DVD collection. Cage is brilliantly ""hyper"" and delivers ""the goods"". The story is great and keeps your attention. However, when will studios learn to properly format these DVDs for 16:9 Wide Screen TVs?? There's no excuse! ""Starship Troopers and ""The Player"" are beautiful examples of properly formated disks! Although this DVD is in ""wide screen"", it's in the original cinema format - no good for the realities of domestic TVs! Anyway, it's a great film - if your a Cage fan, you can't afford to miss this one!"
3,If you enjoy Nicholas Cage and Gary Senise then you will pro,"The movie was good but not great.Nicholas Cage did a good job but it is difficult to like his character until deep into the film. The movie takes time to really get going but it will eventually give you a few white knuckle moments.Gary Senise did a good job with his role as well. His character was very believeable and more likable that CAGE.This is not your Hollywood happy-ending type of movie but if you are a NICHOLAS CAGE fan and/or a GARY SENISE fan, it is at least a good one to rent if not own."
4,Typical Cage and Brian D. stuff. I say check it out.,"The 5.1 DD was great ,also the video was good 5 stars for both. Good plot and mystrey alone with good acting. Cage was his usual self and Sinse was a true bad guy ."
5,Definitely a go-see movie for Cage and Sinise fans.,"I was immediately swept up with the fluidity of the camera angles as it encircled the ring and gave a cursory look at ""the possible suspects"". It was not immediately obvious to me who the culprit would be. In fact, I was surprised to find out who it was. It was a true suspense thriller for me. I'd like to see Nick Cage and Gary Sinise do more visually thrilling and suspenseful movies. Defintely a go-see movie if you missed it at the theater."
4,Not quite as slippey but just as sneaky as a snake is Cage,"In my opinion this is one of 1998s better movies. It has a unique level of suspense which unraveles itself fairly early in the movie. However, the remaing part leaves you guessing as to what will happen next. I don't really think the main motive in the movie is a sound one, but with that aside it is an overall good movie. One in which Cage fits his part quite well. I know this is a very vauge review, but I don't want to give any of the good stuff away. I give it a solid 4 stars. If you like suspense who done it type movies you will like Snake Eyes."
2,Review in swedish ...!,Hmm... den här filmen var ju inte bra. Den är ju inte änns spännande. Man kunde förutsäga allt som skulle hända.JAG NGRAR ATT JAG KÖPTE DEN!!!!
4,The Snake Is In-----!!!!!!,"Let's face it, this is one of those films, that really grabs you. What makes this good entertainment is not just the cast but the way it's directed. The camera work alone is superb---! You can hear the ghost of Alfred Hitchcock nodding his head in approval~!!!!"
3,Depalma turns a familiar story into a good film,"Snake Eyes definately has a plot that you have seen way too many times. However, Depalma's direction saves the day and lends style to the whole film. Cage and Sinise are good, but why does Sinise always get stuck with bad guy roles nowadays? Depalma proves he is one of the best. If you liked this, I recommend Dressed To Kill, Blowout, and Mission Impossible."
2,Definately not one of De Palma's best efforts...,"An interesting story, with some quite spectacular visuals, is marred by a ludicrous ending and a surprisingly poor performance by Cage. After the latter is beat-up, he stumbles around in an almost comedic fashion. This particular scene had me unintentionally laughing -- definately an indication of a performance gone awry."
3,"snake eyes, you crapped out",this was a nice Brian DePalma flick and it had its ups and downs in the middle and I read the book and the ending of the book is better than the ending of the movie because in the ending of the book Gary Sinise's character gets squashed by a big globe thing and in the movie he shoots himself. Cage is just plain crazy people and I like that about him. though the let down is the fight scenes with Stan Shaw and that other boxer.
3,what a great movie this could have been and almost is,"Snake Eyes has a terrific idea which is to have a murder at a live boxing match in Atlantic Cit. The arena is the crime scene and the movie never leaves the building. All this is excellent. The one night idea works well and so does the giant storm outside, but these are all minor details. The story is about a conspiracy and it's good up until we meet the villain who is presented as merely a cliche with unrealistic and often ridiculous looking scowls. There are a lot of things going for this film including Cage playing the hero who is also a corrupt cop (flawed heroes are more interesting than perfect ones), and some amazing directing techniques by Brian DePalma. Ultimately these things don't matter because the story is a giant letdown in the most important act, the ending. It's a good movie but be warned, it is heavily flawed."
3,98% of this is a great thriller,"Snake Eyes is a very entertaining movie. Nicolas Cage is hilarious as a hyperactive crooked cop, and Gary Sinise is good as the stone faced, straight shooter that he normally plays. Before I saw this, critics complained that the identity of the villain was given away too early. But I found this made it more exciting because you didn't know who was going to get to the girl first. The only let down is the ending, which is one of the dumbest, most pointless, unnecessary endings I have ever seen. Otherwise, a great thriller."
4,Action fan?,"So the ending was apparently a bit of a let down. Big deal, this movie is interesting, original and well made. If you're an action fan, you'll want to see it. If you're not, you should see it anyway, it may just convert you."
1,Brian DePalma now rips off his own movies,"DePalma is the master of ripping off other director's techniques. He can copy them down perfectly yet turn them all his own. In Raising Cain he took the famous Psycho scene where the car sunk, copied it, and added his own good thrill to it. But now, DePalma rips off his own films. Yet again he has the long uncut opening. And also rips off his own film (which was a rip off of another) Blow Out. Cage is irritating. The plot lacks thrills or susprises (and it ruins it's key surprise too soon). And then it gets incredibly cheap, as if they ran out of money. Pretty lame Brian!--wcg"
5,"intense, taut, explosive suspense thriller!","i rented it with very low expectations and it quite literally knocked my socks off! gary sinese gives one of the best performances of the year! it's de palma at the peak of his form, doing what he does best! the dvd is awesome in it's sound and it's visuals. do not miss it!!"
5,A murder mystery that keeps you on the edge of your seat!,"Classic DePalma mixed with new age cage and sinese makes Snake Eyes a film that was totally under-rated by critics and movie-goers. Set in an Atlantic City arena during a boxing match, with a huge tropical storm ripping up the coast, the secretary of defence is assassinated. The rest of the film is set in a who-done-it atmosphere. The whole film takes place in real time and is one you shouldn't miss. Believe everything except your eyes!"
1,Braves1991@hotmail.com,"Does Amazon.com offer a refund for crappy movies, because this movie was weak!!!"
1,Bad Eyes,No suspense or thrill about this movie whatsoever.Very poor movie that I strongly suggest avoiding(not even worth 1 star).
1,a disappointment,The only good point about this movie is Cage's excellent performance. Almost everything else is under average. The movie repeats some familiar twists of a generic thriller/murder mystery without any ingeniuty. I would say that I could figure out the whole story from the first 20 minutes. Everything after that was mere filling the gaps. I felt disappointed with this movie in general.
2,weak..,"Sinise looks more as Robert Fitzpatrick in ""Terminator 2- Judgement dAy"" - walking with the eyes of a robot, to show determination! The plot is uncredible weask, the only merit being the flashbakc method of telling the history. Cage is very, very good, but it doesn't save De Palma's lack of inspiration in directing this one."
2,Cage was over-staged.,"This is the first movie I've seen where I didn't like Cage's role. He was not staged well: over-done, too TOO dramatic. He is a great actor. I don't blame this one on him."
5,Great direction...great acting,I thought this was a great example of how good a film can be when you combine great acting with great direction. Cage shines as the corrupt cop out to become mayor...Cage is well balanced by Sinise and both actors are supported by the great camera work and direction of Brian De Palma...a must see film!
2,"An offbalanced,overconcieved movie","Snake Eyes is the worst suspense movie of the decade, though it had some good acting, and 1 good scene of the movie and some good humor to give a **1/2. Though everything was good but the suspense , there was no suspense and they gave you the killer in the beggining of the movie . So it quite clear it's not very intresting."
4,PPV Phantom Punch,"Ricky Santoro is at the biggest fight of the year and he's having a blast with his old friend. The Secretary of Defense is also at the fight and something happens to him. Right before his death, the heavyweight champion of the world fell without getting hit. A woman in white disappears into the hotel and casino after she talked with the Secretary. What's happening? Well, it's up to Nicolas Cage to solve this mystery and he questions everybody from camera technicians to the boxer and unfortunately, his friend. If you haven't seen any previews for the movie, you will like it. The commercials blew everything. I hate that! As the conspiracy unfolds, the woman in white was trying to inform the Secretary of some vital information. Shhh! I can't tell you, it's confidential! This whole problem involves his friend and he can't believe it. Gary Sinise is in this movie and he's good. Carla Gugino is the woman in white and the film was directed by Brian DePalma. Sleek and smooth."
2,Why would DePalma do this movie?,"I love Nic Cage, but he is simply miscast here. We never believe him as the loveably crooked charmer, nor as a highly respected and influential detective. The plot is SO predictable and worn, we wonder why someone like Depalma would be interested in shooting it. Because it is beautifully shot. This movie is for DePalma freaks only, although it did have a nice preformance by a lovely creature named Carla Gugino."
1,BAD MOVIE,I went to see this movie cause I love all Nicolas Cage movies. I almost fell asleep. It was boring and hard to follow. Don't waste your money
4,PERHAPS THE MOST FRUSTRATING FILM I'VE EVER SEEN,"I'M NOT SURE WHETHER TO GIVE THIS FILM 3 OR 4 STARS. OH WELL,I'LL JUST GIVE IT 4. THIS FILM IS SO FRUSTRATING. THE CINEMATOGRAPHY IS BREATHTAKING AND PERHAPS SOME OF THE BEST EVER PUT ON FILM. HOWEVER,THIS FILM HAS SO MANY FLAWS,SUCH AS,A RIDICULOUS TWIST REVEALING THE VILLIAN. ALSO,THERE IS A STUPID SCENE IN AN ELEVATOR WHERE A MAN IS ABOUT TO PUSH A BUTTON AND THE WOMAN HE'S WITH PREVENTS HIM FROM DOING IT AND SAYS ""SORRY,JUST WANTED A HUG."" ALSO,THE CLIMAX IS SO DULL (DE PALMA COULD HAVE STAGED A VERY EXCITING CLIMAX),AND THE ENDING TO THE FILM IS SO UNNECESSARY. OTHER THAN THAT,THIS IS A FINE THRILLER AND DE PALMA FANS WILL PROBABLY NOT BE LESS FLAWED DE PALMA FILM WITH GREAT CINEMATOGRAPHY CHECK OUT ""BLOW OUT"" WHICH WAS INSPIRED BY ANTONIONI'S ""BLOW-UP"" IF I WERE DE PALMA,I WOULD HAVE MADE THE PLOT MORE COMPLEX"
1,SLEEPY EYES,There was not one surprise in this movie. In fact the plot has been used and reused and over used in a myriad of movies. Hollywood just puts them through the carbon copy machine. NOT WORTH YOUR TIME. Not even for Nicolas Cage.
1,"Bad, Really Bad",Nicolas Cage couldn't have done a worse job in this picture. I liked most of his other movies though... Bad direction???
1,It sucked.,"It was totally trash. It was not a good part for Nicolas Cage. The camera angles were good, but the plot sucked. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. If you like Nicolas Cage, see City of Angels."
3,OK for the discounted price,"I got this headset at a heavily discounted price about an year ago and one side of the earphone stopped to work recently. Considering the fact that it only costed me about $1 per month, I can't really complain.The sound quality of the earphone is mediocre. It makes OK sound if you are not too picky, that is all. The microphone is just barely usable. You will have to speak loudly to make the other side of the line hear you.It is actually not so uncomfortable if you wear it right. It can sit on your head tightly without make your ear hurt, at least not too much. The only thing not so good about this design is that you can't lay down on your bed or rest your head on the headrest of your chair while wearing this headset.Overall, if you just want a cheap, usable headset and don't expect it to last for years, this product can be a good choice when you see some aggressive discount."
1,Absolutely do not buy this product.,"I bought these as a relatively cheap solution replace the built in microphone on my laptop and figured the headset would be an added bonus when gaming. These worked for a very limited period of time.. probably about a month before the microphone died and never worked again. I thought it was probably the mute and volume switch in the middle so after having them sit in my basement for a couple months I tried to cut it open and bypass it, no dice, don't even try."
3,"Decent, but not the last pair you'll buy","I owned maybe two or three of this item before I finally realized that I was just throwing my money away for the most part. The sound quality was actually very good, but the headset itself was terribly uncomfortable. No matter how much I wore them, they would always hurt my ears after a few hours. The behind the head style of these headphones is not as effective as it is with smaller headphones because of the sheer weight.Every set that I owned failed in the cord usually after 4-6 months. Most often the mic would die, which was the part that I needed most. Of every set of headphones that I've owned (and I've owned a lot) this is probably the worst.I gave this item a 3 star rating because it is honestly not a bad place to start if you're just getting started with serious gaming. I played plenty of competitive league matches with this headset before I moved on."
1,Not worth the 20 dollars.,"Cheaply made plastic, and uncomfortable!! I have had these for about two months, and they already broke. I have owned three different Logitech gaming headsets and they all were garbage after a couple of months. The problem always started with the volume control even though I never use it, but after month the right earpiece wouldn't even get sound unless you press down and hold the volume control. After another month they just stopped all together, and I was even extra careful with this one too since the same thing happened with the other two Logitech models I owned. After opening the volume control up this time and seeing the cheap parts they used to make it I understand why it stopped working. I will never buy a Logitech headset again that's for sure."
2,Don't last long,"I have owned two sets of these headphones. The first one started shorting out. If I put pressure on the wire coming out, they would work. Eventually even this didn't work and they quit for good. I got another set because they were pretty much the only ones available at the store, and because I thought it might have been an isolated incident. Well, as of today, the second set is going out in the very same way. The left ear doesn't wok unless you apply pressure to the wire. I will never buy another set of Logitech headphones. Both lasted approximately 6 months. Now I am in search of a good set of gaming phones."
1,Not worth the plastic its made from,"I bought one of these from Best Buy and got it home it setup easily and seemed to work well enough. The open ear was nice as most headphones tend to hurt my ears after a half an hour or so.Within a month the mic wouldn't respond. I took it back and got another one, same thing happened on that one. Within a month or so the mic went out. On the second one I made sure to keep it put up and safe, was extra careful with the cord and made sure it was pampered, but it still happened.Don't waste your money!"
1,Very Disappointing!,I have three boys and we all play online games with our PC. These are not meant for comfort. After a while of play my ears would hurt. Then I got a report from online players that my mic did not work or it was very intermittant. Now there is a short in the wire and the sound cuts in and out. I have had these for about a year. SHOULDN'T SOMETHING LIKE THAT SUPPOSE TO LAST LONGER!!!! Was Logitech bought out by someone? Their items have been poor in quality and break after a short time of use. I have had a couple of mice by them recently stop working after a short period of use! I think I am done with Logitech.
4,Good headphones for a secondlife player,"It's a very good pair of headphones for someone who uses SecondLife alot like I do. the only problem is that on rare occasions the top of my ear gets compressed to my head and winds up hurting, but that's easy to remedy. make sure the top of your ears are sitting properly in the headphones."
1,Consider ear replacements if you use these.,"Sound quality is 'ok', is what you would expect from a cheap headset. I didn't allow this to be on my head long enough to test the mic. They freak me out. After placing the ear extractors onto my head, in about 5 minutes my ears feel like they will permanently be pointed strait out to the side. After about 10 minutes they are what I would consider 'painful'. After about an hour they feel great...er that is because you went back to best buy and exchanged them for a different set. Logitech has never let me down, until now. Simply put, don't buy these."
1,DON'T GO HERE!,"Within 5 minutes of opening the box to this poorly constructed headset, the microphone dangled loosely from its housing, the cheap plastic conector having broken. The pads on the earpieces fell off and were very difficult to put back on, frustrating and very annoying to say the least. Returned to the store from which they came the next day. Only wish I could give them a zero rating. My opinion of this, and many other Logitech products,----yech!"
2,"Decent Fit and Style, Terrible Sound","I bought this headset because it looked sturdy and had good specs for the price. Within 10 seconds of firing up World of Warcraft with these on (before even trying the voice part), I noticed that the audio quality was way below par. When you loot an NPC that has money, there is a kind of ringing noise like a cash register that occurs when you take the money. At least it sounds like that through any decent speakers or headphones. With this set it sounded like I was taking a wet bag of money from the bottom of a muddy swamp.Also, music has no oomph and voice is tinny. I will be returning these and getting a Sennheiser set, either the PC145 or the PC155."
5,Great deal,"This is a great headset. Sounds are crisp and the mic is extremely clear. I have two sound cards. One for a 5.1 speaker system and one for the headset. With the open ear design, I can listen to both. I would recommend this headset to anyone who likes to play online games or just simple chatting."
1,Low sound quality,It was disappionting to hear my music and games in this bad set of earphones.Logitech should take care where to put your brand name.
3,Eh...,Alright for a cheap headset its worth it. since logitech built it the quality is there but since its cheap it blows at the same time...Talking through it is crystal from what people tell me. But listening through it blows by far. 1 the headset is one size. With it being 1 size its shaped horribly.Pretty much. If you need a headset buy it... but if you don't need it right now I would suggest spending an extra 10 bucks for a better one.
3,*** Try it on before you buy ***,"I bought this Logitech headset for the purpose of creating corporate training videos, so the audio recording functionality needed to be clear and crisp. The positive is that the audio functionality works pretty well--audio plays back at a level of quality that is definitely use-able.The problem is that I'm not able to wear the headset for more than an hour at a time. No one has ever told me that I have a super fat head, so I can only conclude that I don't. This headphone feels like it's spread to its max which makes my head feel like it's in a vice. This tension also causes the earpiece foam to press too closely against my ears, which makes me sweat. Definitely not cool! I'm not sure who was responsible for design of this product, but the prototype must have been tested on people with extremely narrow heads."
3,Not worth the money,"I have Ventrilo program and when ever I connect to it using the mic part of it, my friends tell me they hear nothing but static. since there are no drivers that I can download, these will not be getting used by me. Your better off going for the cheaper brand."
1,Terrible headset!,"I bought this headset, looking to replace an old pair of headphones. The sound is muffled, the microphone is weak, and sound I'm listening to bleeds through so other people can hear it over my mic. Certainly not a product I'd buy again, waste of money."
2,Sound Quality Does Not Outshine Discomfort,"I'll keep it short:Sounds great, fits terribly for long gaming sessions.It's behind the neck design means the headset's weight is resting on the top of your ears, which begin to hurt after an hour or so, and it clamps to stay there.For long gaming sessions, get a headset with a headstrap, not behind the neck."
1,Is it a CROWN?,"Yeah, it has a nice fit, but if you like to have a 10lbs helmet on then this is for you.The mic is immobile. But it looks really cool to have it on.Sound range is quiet. Tested on most applications, works, but the top of the ears hurt after a bit."
4,Decent Headset,"The headset is good. Sound quality is good. I personally haven't tried it on games, but my brother does and he hasn't complained about it. Microphone works just fine.One thing i don't like, but you might, is the wire. It's a bit too long it's annoying.That's about it."
4,Good enough,"These headsets do not have the best sound in the world but are good enough, and are confortable too, at least for me..."
1,Horrible fit,"I play quite a few online games and use TS with friends. I bought these at BB and immediately regretted it. The fit is horrible; after playing for an hour or more, my ears hurt from the fit. The fit also prevents the sound quality.I'm now happy that my cat has chewed through the cord so that I have to go out and buy a new pair. =)"
3,Simply...okay.,"I was hoping for more when I read some of the reviews of this headset. I'll give my pros and cons:Pros:- Decent sound- Easy setup, just plug in and go- Easy to adjust volume controllerCons:- Hurts your ears after an hour or so because the hard, molded plastic band has to use pressure to hold in place on your head (because it sits behind, not on top). I sometimes leave it stretched around a DVD case at night so it doesn't squeeze so tightly when I put it on.- Volume controller on my cable is bad. One earphone goes out with just a movement of the volume controll. I have to squeeze the dial to get the right ear working again. It was that way right out of the box. It's annoying but not worth sending back over the cost.Overall, it's not a bad headset. I just expected a little more because of the claims in the ads. They aren't too costly, so it still have some value."
1,Logitech Precision Gaming Headset,"Well I have to say I am not all that pleased with this headset. For one there is not adjustment to fit your ears. After a while of having them on, I get a headache."
1,Replaced 6-7 times over the past 2 years,"The first time I ever bought a warranty with a product and it was with this product, man what a lucky choice. It's a two year warranty and has been replaced 3-4 times.. I'm not sure they stop letting me replace it after 3 or 4... I got ANOTHER two year warranty and have already had to replace it twice. Main problems: One of the ear's on the headset stops working, Microphone stops working, earpads fall off making it uncomfortable to wear.Its just cheap. Spend the extra 10-20-30 bucks and get something that's worth the money, no reason to waste ur money with this. To be fair I only bought it because of customer loyalty / Plantronics has been good in the past but this is a bad headset."
2,"Decent Sound, Good Mic, but it doesn't matter because...","this thing is the most uncomfortable headphones I've ever put on. How does Logitech think that a ""one size fits all"" headset will work?I cannot wear this thing for longer than 30 minutes without my ears turning red and hurting."
1,Horrible Head Set,"I agree with all the negative reviews out there. I made the mistake and trust the brand name! Logitech products are usually really good, but this time I'm very disappointed.One reviewer stated, do not use these headphones if you wear glasses, and oh boy, I should've read the reviews before I bought these horrible headphones.I'm a heavy gamer and can spend hours playing. Therefore, I need headphones that are comfortable. These headphones do not deserve the title ""gaming headset"", because the fit is extremely weird, the ear pieces are very uncomfortable and the sound is mediocre at best.The ear pieces are round, so they will put pressure to different parts of your ear and need constant adjusting. The way the clamp down around your head feels unnatural. They are so tight, that you will also adjust your glasses all the time.So, I recommend that you add a few bucks to your budget and buy something else. I just did."
2,Don't get these.,Headset broke long before it should have. Very disappointed be it seemed very durable. Fairly comfortable but awkward.
2,This is NOT a good gaming headset. Makes a good torture device though.,"Gaming headset...let me see...I guess it's not bad for the money. Not too expensive but even then I don't think you even get what you paid for. Sure, the headset is atractive, maybe a little big but the design does call gaming. Thats about it. Sound its substandard commpared to other gaming headsets of the same price, and if you have moderate size ears like me, this thing will hurt them like a medivel torture device. Somebody made a good comment about the open air design of the speakers and the fact that your ears don't sweat...and it's true. They don't sweat...they could bleed maybe...but no sweat. If you are looking for a good gaming headset I can suggest Sennheiser PC155. They are more expensive but you get every penny worth."
1,Ouch!,"Any review you read here will not be able to fully express how terrible these headphones are. I have fairly normal ears. All ears are a little goofy, but these headphones HURT my ears after a few hours. The sound is fine, the microphone is pretty crappy, but works. I don't know whose idea it was to design these headphones, but either they or the person who decided it was suitable for sale should be fired. Behind my ears there is visible damage where sharp plastic and insufficient padding have been pressing tightly. Additionally, the volume control is awful... it's a little tiny nob that runs in a circle, counter clockwise raising the volume. On top of the nob being too tiny, it is also very difficult to turn, rendering it nearly useless. I can either move it with my teeth or adjust the volume with game settings. Pretty ridiculous. Bad form Logitech, my last product I will EVER buy from you... two bad headsets in a row."
1,Simply useless if you can't wear it,"I was shocked to find that Logitech, a name I normally trust for peripherals, had created something as sloppily-designed as this headset.First, the fit was just plain atrocious. It was insanely uncomfortable, yet felt ready to fall off at any time. The other reviewer who said this was right on. (And yes, I had them on the right way!...)The sound was passable, but nothing near what I expected with the ""Gaming Headset"" moniker attached liberally to the packaging.Sadly, the only decent thing about it was how easy the return process was. Avoid at all costs if you wear glasses, and try to stay away even if you don't. Your ears will thank you."
2,put your head in a vice,"I've been using this headset for about 3 months and I can't stand it. The wrap around your neck puts pressure on your ears and is not comfortable. The ear cups are so large, you won't be able to wear glasses with this set on unless you rest the temples on the top of the earpiece instead of on your ear.The sound is ok and I like the volume control. I'd look elsewhere for a new headset."
1,Broken in 3 weeks?,"I purchased this item about 3 weeks ago. I was very excited, it sounded great, my voice came over more clearly over the voice chat program I use for gaming, ventrilo. But 3 days after purchase the mouth piece mic fell off. It kind of snaps back in but falls off with any little nudge, but the microphone still worked. 3 weeks later the microphone stopped working altogether. I had to resort back to using my old desktop microphone.The on-cord volume is kind of a pain to use also, as it doesn't turn very well, and I have to use fingernails in order to change the volume, not a big deal since I can adjust it on my keyboard, but kind of useless to me since I do use the headset while gaming, digging my nails into the volume nob to get it to work is distracting.Next time I will spend a bit more money to get one that will last a bit longer."
3,They do the job,"These are OK. Not the best build quality or sound quality (for speakers and mic) but they work.I find them quite comfortable because of the open design and the around-the-ear pads. They are also very light, which makes them a good choice for just throwing in a bag for LAN parties or just going to a bookstore or whatever to chat online.If you are looking for a good quality gaming headset though, this is not it.Not too bad for the price, I'm not really unhappy with the purchase (I just got them to have a cheap pair that I won't cry over when it breaks at a LAN party or gets stolen), but I would just spend a little more and get something a bit better."
1,Logitech Precision PC Gaming Headset 980231-0403,"This headset is most impossible to position on your head. No matter what size your head is. It has a thick hard plastic band that goes arount the back of your head. The band is not adjustable. It is one solid peice of plastic. The band does not fit snug. It just kinda of hangs, leaving the very heavy ear phones to weigh on your ears until they want to fall off. They are very uncomfortable. You have to try to keep a balance in feeling like you can't move an inch or they will fall off. The way that these fit on your head make the mic hard to be heard by the recieving end. In short they are a waste of money!"
4,Good deal for the $$,"I bought this headset to replace a lightweight model that had broken. These headphones are worn behind the neck style. sound quality is pretty good. The mic is clear and picks up your voice well. The mic is adjustable up and down but you cant position it closer to your mouth. The inline volume control is a nice touch so you wont have to exit a game to adjust the volume. The headset is pretty comfortable unless you plan on wearing it for a long time. After about two hours of playing counter strike source or day of defeat source I'm ready for a break. I must mention that these things are durable. I think you could run them over with your car and they'd still function. To me, that's their best feature since I've had other headseats break. So if you're looking for a decent set of headphones that sound good and will take loads of abuse then these are worth considering. There was a rebate available when I purchased these headphones which made this an offer that I couldn't pass up"
2,The mic is not good. The design is not very comfortable,"The headset sits on the back of head, which is ok, however due to large ear rests it feals awkward and uncomfortable. I was not able to use volume control, as the headphones were only audible at higher volume level.The mic is poor. Whether you want it for gaming or just general purpose use, its better to skip this for something else."
3,Not disappointed,The sound quality suits my purpose (for gaming) just fine.The inline volume control is a very poor design and differcult to use.
1,Fails in most every way possible,"Construction : junk. the mic is held on by a flimsy disc which has brokenon TWO of these for me.Comfort : Horrible, unless you plan to use this as a prop in somesecond-life S&M; dungeon role-playing scenario. After anhour or so your brains will fell like they are beingnestled inside one of the following(i'll let you choose)- a garlic press- an iron maiden.- a freshly hatched face-hugger stuffing analien embryo in your chestperformance : The headphones are just what should expect for thisprice-point, so i cant complain.The mic is another story. The mic is actually not justanother story, its an epic russian tome of suffering,frustration and abandonment. I can sometimes get it tosort of work when I TAKE IT OFF OF MY HEAD and hold it""just so"".summary : THIS THING DOESNT WORK ! I've been using these gamingheadsets for years (some good, some bad) this thing isnteven functional."
3,Fun toy I bought as a gift,"The box said the toy came with batteries, so I did not buy any. The batteries in it were DEAD, so the recipient could not play with the toy until we went out and bought the special batteries it requires. The outside of the box should have clearly said to buy batteries as inside it said that the batteries included were for demonstration only! After new batteries, the girl loved the game. Word of advice to others...BUY batteries...but it doesn't tell you on the outside of the box what kind!"
2,Electronic UNO Game,I bought this toy for my Mom as she liked electronic poker games. She never really took to this game although she played the UNO card game. This game seemed a little complicated for her although perhaps a young person might like this game.
5,Love my UNO!!!,"I love this game. I take it with me wherever I go. It keeps my occupied for hours. This is my second UNO, I wore out my first one. I had it for over 9 years."
3,Trout Fishing,"This is a good book on trout fishing the GSMNP. The author is very knowledgeable on the subject covered, but the book probably needs updated. I believe that trout fishing GSMNP is not what it used to be. Unless you walk a long way into the wilderness areas of the Park, trout fishing is fair at best."
2,Unbelievable,"Production values are better than the average SciFi channel movie, but not by much. The acting is somewhat believable in places, but the plot is predictable and highly implausible."
1,In a word: BAD,"You get the military geeks playing tron: getting into a computer game to have fun and thrills on a Friday night, shooting up whatever is the virtual reality prison. Problem, is, there is a ghost in the prison that is uploaded into the game and starts killing people. First the virtual reality ones, then the real ones. In the end, it is (drum roll please) not defeatable. Now there is a twist. If you haven't seen this story line a half-dozen times before, you haven't been looking.The script is weak. It takes a good 30 minutes of the movie just to set up the background. The dialogue is nothing but F___k, and S____t. The acting is weak and ultimately the movie is a waste of whatever time you invest, including the time it takes to get the DVD out of the box."
3,It's ok,"The movie is about a military simulation computer that helps train soldiers in combat. The computer gets hijacked by a ghost when the programmers took the simulator and used it for gaming. So, they have to try to escape the machine. The movie is ok, short and too the point. The coinncidences were too obvious and, as another reviewer said, not enough humor.The Special Features are not that great. It has a boring making-of featurette.All in all, it was ok. It was not scary enough and the pacing was a bit slow."
2,Skip it,"Did you ever have one of those dreams where nothing makes sense, the dialog is poorly written and the acting is terrible? If you haven't, now's your chance to see what it's like. A group of drug using young but successful techy types use inexplicable technology in inexplicable ways. Hijinks ensue when a ghost starts killing people. Attempts are made at a plot. It doesn't turn out too well.To the writer's credit, the premise is fairly creative. Unfortunately, the execution flops in every dimension. The best thing about it? The same best thing about Transformers - Rachael Taylor. She would make a movie about needlepoint worth watching."
2,So bad it's still not good,"I've seen plenty worse movies in my life, but Ghost Machine ranks as one of the worst I have seen all year. The acting is actually better than the material, but that's not really saying much at all. Rachel Taylor (Transformers) is at least easy to look at and she has a sexy Australian accent, but that alone doesn't save us from the boring story. Even the kills and villain are lame. I actually thought this film had potential in a low budget sense at first, but it just went on and on with not much excitement. I'll be nice and round up to two stars out of five."
2,Yawn inducing video game horror,"Ghost Machine is the latest in a line of gory cyber-horrors that is expected to cater to both horror fans and gamers alike. Coming from across the pond, Ghost Machine revolves around military video game techs Tom (Never Back Down's Sean Faris) and Vic (The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor's Luke Ford) who discover that their stolen software has been infected with the a vengeful ghost (Hatla Williams). Before you know it, Vic's military girlfriend Jess (Rachael Taylor from Shutter and Transformers) has immersed herself in the game as well, and things go from bad to worse before you know it. Loaded with stilted acting and poor CGI gore effects, Ghost Machine is pretty boring throughout, and takes plenty long enough to set up its plot. There are some decent moments of action to be found though, so the film as a whole isn't a total waste of time. All in all, you could do worse than Ghost Machine, but you could certainly do a lot better as well."
2,Watchable... if there's nothing else to watch,"""Ghost Machine"" is a pretty typical ""people running around in a dark house getting killed"" movie. The two most interesting things about it are:1) A lot of the action takes place in a virtual reality setting.2) It's a UK production (Northern Ireland), so people have accents.Other than that, there's nothing here that you haven't seen before. Also, as is typical of British production, the plot development and action move much more slowly than in US films. It takes a long time for anything to get going, and then it doesn't go very quickly.I ""watched"" this movie while I was working. It made good visual wallpaper, but I don't think it would have held my interest if I have been giving it my full attention."
2,No Thanks,"This feels like a SciFi (well, SyFy) special. It's pretty boring, lacks suspense, and doesn't have very high production values. I'd recommend you skip this one."
2,Interesting idea but fails to deliver,"I wont list the plot as so many other reviewers will already have., just give you my opinion on watching it. When I first heard about this movie I thought wow that's going to be cool. I was disappointed, although it was an interesting concept it never quite got off the ground. It was over 20 minutes into the movie before it even got interesting for me, but never delivered on the science, the fear, nor did I have any connection with the characters. Although I did like the acting of Luke Ford and Sam Corry, their characters were believable. I don't think it was completely a waste of time but would I watch it again? No."
2,Suitably Unghostly,"Despite having at least some potential for a good story( the way its described in the interview with the main writer of this film) we basically wind up with a poor cousin of the spookier kind. Even given that the writer Sven Hughes makes some reference to the EXISTENZ film, but traces the genesis of his idea ten years before to a scientist who experimented with religious experience inducing techniques; we also have a poor cousin of Poltergeist where the Ghost is not even as spooky as one could hope for, and the ending is as lame as three legged donkey.Admittedly, some cool gear is used, however, the cool gear is countermanded by some immensely boring sequences where we discover things, and we ""get scared""... well no not really, a few good chills start to develop, but it feels like some editor or censor thought better of the idea. Even OPEN GRAVES is spookier than this film, and thats because Eliza Dushku is in it."
2,Couldn't get into it... Found it rather boring.,"I wanted to like this film, but right from the start it was boring, cliché, and failed to hook me.The basic story is ""military brats steal military virtual simulator software that interfaces directly with your brain, and things go haywire when they try to use it.""I really can't much recommend this movie. I'd hoped it would be something worthwhile, futuristic, cyberpunk, etc. But, it wasn't. It was the same story that's been told a hundred times, with about 90 of them being better than this pile.If you want a good cyberpunk story, try Avalon, Existenz, or better yetThe Thirteenth Floor(a truly great flick). Not feeling this one, unfortunately."
3,Cyber Ghostbusters,"I am not really much of a fan of ""cyber"" thrillers or anything, so you might like this movie more than me if you are into that sort of thing. The plot of this movie is like some sort of non-comical, computer ghost busters or something... so, the plot wasn't very interesting to me. I could have forgiven some plot shortcomings if there had been decent dialog, action, acting, or mood. Unfortunately the movie was lacking in these areas as well.I am not saying that I hated the movie, because I didn't hate it. I wouldn't want to watch it again, but it was certainly better than a good number of low-budget affairs out there.I would recommend this movie for people who are into the idea of people entering into computer world and the whole ""cyber"" thing. This stuff isn't for me, but you might enjoy it if you are into that sort of thing.Rating: 2.5 / 5 - rounded up to 3"
2,Horror by the numbers,"This is a made for DVD horror movie, about a group ""borrowing"" an experimental Army Virtual Reality system for a weekend of gaming in a haunted prison. I do like the idea behind the story, the VR device puts you into a ""Waking Dream"" state and that is where the ghosts are.Unfortunately, this good idea is buried under tons of bad acting, bad writing and poor FX. And I mean SyFy movie of the week bad. I don't know why some script writers think using swearing as punctuation for every sentence is a good idea, but it just comes off as something only people in movies do.Overall, if you are snowed in and need something to pass the time, it's OK. But don't expect much."
1,Ugh.,"OK. So if you are incredibly bored, this movie will at least fill 92 minutes of your time. I tend to like bad horror movies because you can laugh at them. But this one has no humor, even the unintended kind. The plot has been way overused. If you can see anything original in it, you obviously have been eyesight than I do. The acting is about what you'd expect in the average low-end B movie. Watch it if you feel the need, but don't say I didn't warn you."
2,Boring and Unoriginal,"I wanted to fall asleep during the first half hour or so of this movie. Not only is it boring there is just nothing original or unique about it. There are several scenes with badly done CGI, and others where the screen is almost black and you have no clue what is going on with the discombobulated storyline.About the only redeeming quality in this movie is Sean Farris and Rachel Taylor's acting. Both are excellent, especially when they are dealing with this storyline."
3,Ghost Machine,This movie isn't one that I'd ever choose to watch again or recommend to a friend. At first it looks promising but it quickly flatlines and stays there. My husband who can sit through any movie that involves guns and fight scenes no matter how bad the story line or acting is got up and started laundry during this one.
3,Ghost In The Machine,"The young but capable cast,who were all new to me,do a fine job and the film is never dull.They play a bunch on military technicians that decide to use the CGI simulator that they use on their normal duty,on their time off for fun and things do not go as planned.The action is pretty good and there are lots of thrills and I enjoyed it quite a bit because of the good action in the film.The extras consist of a making of Ghost Machine film,an interview with the writer/director and the trailer.The only warning I have is there is a ton of foul language,for those that care (Not Me!) and some bloody stuff that that might gross out the tender types.I enjoyed it throughout and I'll watch it again down the line."
1,How Sweet It Is - NOT!,"I like some of Stryper's stuff, but this album is pretty lame. Michael Sweet has a great voice. He even writes good songs, but this 5 song release is pathetic. If you really like Stryper, maybe this is OK for you. As for me, I already plan to trade this one for something else that I would actually listen to now and then."
5,the midas man,A riviting story.It was hard to put this book down. This story tells me that we will be reading more of T W Salvador books in the future( Not too long I hope).
1,Below Zero! NOT like the Anime version at all! VERY DISAPPOINTING!,"I was VERY disappointed after watching this version of Crying Freeman! I own the entire anime series and love that version very much, so was very eager to finally get to watch this one. I was more than disappointed after viewing it. For those of you who have seen and love the anime version you will understand what I mean if you ever decide to watch this one. The only good parts about this version are the actor/actress that play Freeman and Emu. I was told before watching that this was supposed to follow the anime version almost ver batum, and was sorely disappointed when I realized that was not the case. Too many scenes in this version did not even follow the storyline of the anime version. For those who do like this version, I appologize for my slamming, but I feel this version is total disrespect for the original anime."
1,BEWARE!!!,"CAREFUL with seller they may or may NOT return your call and/or email if you have and issue with a product you purchase from them. Also, beware that if purchase a product and the description uses vague or ""wordy"" words, your are screwed by both Amazon and the seller, cause you should have known."
5,crying freeman,"lots of action and the story is really good,the condition of the package and dvd is in great shape"
5,best movie ever,This is the best anime ever and you can find all five of them to rent at hollywood video.
2,"much promise, little execution",A movie that begins with an intricate promise but pewters out right after the beginning and becomes a love/lust story that's neither very passionate nor very romantic.
2,Easily curable,"The plague known as bad breath facing this country is easily tamed with Altoids latest blockbuster release: the cinnamon strip. Just place a few of these red hot bacteria busters on your tongue and prepare yourself to embark on a wild ride full of plot twists and near-death experiences. The 32 strips contained in this package should last at least a week, but I suck these down faster than my cigarettes, and usually burn through 2 tins a day.Equally as enjoyable on hot summer evenings and cold winter mornings alike, Altoids delivers with the punctuality of a 16 year old kid on his first job interview. Any other breath extermination product is inherently inferior to Altoids (TM)."
5,"Refreshing, Great CD","Zydeco at it's finest! This CD has it all, Zydeco, Blues, and R&B. How can you not love it! ... kicking Drummer too..."
5,Down The Bayou - Zydeco Ear Candy,"Donna Angelle is a talent unto herself. Down The Bayou shows Donna's ability to play a variety of styles. There is a touch of R&B,and Blues in addition to her awesome Zydeco tracks. The title 'Zydeco Man' will make you want to dance even if you don't know how. Donna's accordion skills are impressive and her vocals are pure strength. Down The Bayou is a treat that any listener will enjoy."
4,"Egypt of the Pharaohs, 3rd edition","This is the textbook we use in my Egyptian History course at the University of Alabama. It is a great book on egypt stretching from the old stone age to the Ptolmic Pharaohs.Interesting to read, I disagree somewhat with Gardiner, but i read the book thirty years after it's first publication. Gardiner's book is essential to anyone wanting to understand Egypt."
2,"fine production values, dull music","This musical is one that makes you wonder who ever thought, ""Hey! This idea would make a great musical!?"" And did they ever realize that they were mistaken? Now, that said, I suppose if one were Jewish, or just plain thrilled by the horrible things done by the Nazis - or wondered what 'fun' it might be to live in a oppressed getto and put on a show where every one of the oppressed dies in the end... by their own hand...The production values are good, the acting and casting are good... and the music, perhaps each song on its own, is from fair to good, but all collected together yjey made for a dull, uninteresting, somewhat depressing musical and a waste of money and time. It felt like this show lasted longer than WW II."
4,enjoyed it!,"I enjoyed ""My Soul Fainted Within Me"". It's topics are for more mature teens (high school), but it certainly touches on many topics relevant to teens today."
3,Z-ro Da Crooked!!!,"This is my first Z-ro album I have bought....And I mainly bought it because he was on Rap-a-Lot records. This album is a self portrait and I mean this...He took his feelings and put them to some gritty trks and makes you understand him without u knowing him. That is what makes him strong in my opinion, theres no hype or major ""industry"" playas on the album to help him. Its only two guest on the album and one of them is Scarface.What kills me is dude has been grinding so hard under the rader that i think this is his tenth album....i went and heard some trks from the other albums and plan to purchase most of them!! Give this cat a try....Because it's Real Talk on this album."
5,This book lights up my life,"I have no words to describe what this book has meant to me. If there were one human being, no longer alive, whom I could meet in person, it would be Jacques Lusseyran. The book reminds me again and again that there can be light, love and hope even at the bleakest, darkest times and that we see with more than our eyes."
5,Spellbinding,"I had put this on my Wish List for reasons that I forgot, when I learned my granddaughter was reading it for a 7th grade class. It wasn't what I expected; it is unique; as was the life of the author. Just when you think there is nothing new to come out about the Holocaust, you come across a gem like this."
5,Highly Recommended,"Great insight (no pun intended)! This book is going to be part of my permanent library. Additionally, this book should be required reading for any parent or grandparent of a blind child."
5,perceptive,"The author insists that his blindness (a result of a freak accident after which his eyes were removed) was the best thing that ever happened to him. He tells the story of his life before and during the French Resistance, in which he was an important leader. Being blind hardly seemed a disability at all. This isn't a book about the limitations of blindness. It's about seeing without eyes, and awakened inner perceptions."
2,I just would not buy this book,This book had moments that I thought were great and others that were so disconnected to the story. The ending was frustrating and I threw the book across the room... This is a story of Hope Prescott who falls for Zack Givens who is a rich handsome man. The hitch is that Hope thinks that Zack the butler instead of the mean rich business man. In the end I am not sure I would recommend this book -- I think you could find other books that would be a better source of your time and money.
1,just the way you are - simply dreadful,I like Christina Dodd but she is getting increasingly hit and miss. Her regencies are good but this is a contemporary and different standards apply. Why is the heroine a virgin? Why is there a 13 year gap between her and the hero? This reads like a bad mills and boon from the early 80's. They were part of their time and place but this book has no excuse. It had so many internal inconsistencies and cliches that it infuriated me.I was skimming by the end and even so it infuriated me. It was so predictable and banal. Reading it was a waste of a good afternoon.
4,1/2 Stars,"I really enjoyed reading this book. I was hesitant at 1st, because the storyline seemed worn, but it was in my recommendations and I purchased it.I can not wait for the next one!! She managed to make Zach very appealing and vulnerable while being a major jerk! I don't beleive I can tell you about this book and make it sound good, I know that it didn't for me, but I was desperate to read something, and I bought it. This one may even make my keeper shelf if the sequels are as good as I think they are going to be.Try this one, it is worth full price!! I also just read Body Check, by Deidre Martin and it was a really fun read too!!!"
1,Unappealing,"Since this is Ms. Dodd's first contemporary romance, I would like to give her a good recommendation, but unfortunately I cannot.The basic idea behind this story isn't bad but it plays out poorly. The story and the cast of characters lack depth. Some scenes don't make sense.Zack is self-involved and sometimes nasty. Hope lacks charm. Her sarcasm has too much bite to be amusing. Both characters are immature.I wish Ms. Dodd well in her future endeavors into contemporary romance, but this one misses the mark."
2,ehhh blah,"well, since plenty of people have already written the whole story/plot line i won't do that....but i will tell you that this book i not all that great, it sounds promising and cute or just good for a weekend read, but it's not.... the romance/love story is pratically non-exsistent....they meet and w/in a week she's giving up her viginity to him, and he doesn't even seem that great of a guy! i just..didn't like this book....don't waste yourtime on it"
1,1 Star is Too Many!,"This is the type of book that gives romance novels a bad name. Insulting to women, men, and the working poor. Not worth the paper is it printed on. Do not waste your money! I would offer to send you mine for free but I used it as a wastebasket liner."
2,What A Disappointment,"What can I say? I'll start with the high points since it is always good to start with a compliment. Dodd retains her sense of humor that you expect from reading her historicals, and that is good. The book moves fast so it can be read in one sitting (If you chose to finish it, that is) I don't however, believe that most people upon hearing that a child's parents had been accused of embezzlement would blame the child for the crime, especially in a modern city like Boston. That is just too unbelievable for words. Combine that with an irrational contempt for Wal-Mart (Hey, dosen't Wal-Mart sell her books?) and community colleges, and you have a reciepe for alienating most of your reading public. I think this book was a good attempt to write a contemporary, but you cannot use the same formula for a modern story as you do for a historical -times and values change and they will not ring true, which sadly is the case here."
1,I tried hard to like it,"I have loved almost all of of Christina Dodd's books--and the ones I didn't love, I at least liked. I have to confess that I mostly read historical fiction or straight non-fiction, and that I thought that I would work my way into contemporary fiction via an author who was a known entity to me. I don't know if it was the characters (who I couldn't identify with), or the story (which didn't grab me) or the setting, or the time period, or whatever--I wasn't impressed. I wanted to stop after the first half-hour, but I gave it another 100 pages, & finally gave up. I put the book aside with relief and without the least interest in how it would end."
2,Not a promising start to a series.,The book begins and ends with a sister's quest to find her lost siblings. The author gets way off track in between with a lot of silliness. I quickly read through it and don't know if I will pursue the obvious sequel.
2,Not worth the purchase,"I've enjoyed some of Chis Dodd's books, but not this one.The story lacks depth thus the characters seem shallow.The horoine is 'stong' enough to want to find her family yet 'weak' by putting up with such an authoritarian lover.And the end....getting the reader excited to purchase the next book? I won't be one."
3,Nothing groundbreaking...,"I found Just the Way You Are in a local bookshop for one dollar and decided to give it a shot. As a first attempt at contemporary fiction I think Christina Dodd gave an excellent effort. Personally, I don't think it was a horribly written book...but is it the finest? No...the characters are so embittered with their pasts (aren't they usually?) that it seems to affect their every waking move. I also feel that not enough background information was given about the characters - and as someone else pointed out, the kidnapping scene was ridiculous. And I definitely feel that Hope did not make Zack crawl enough after he acted like such a horrible ass to her. Hope isn't a very believable character - I really can't stand the perfect, do-gooder, churchy types.So survey says: If you're looking for a quick read with a familiar plot line that is decent then give it a shot."
3,It was worth the cover price,"I have read a lot of Christina Dodd books, and I have to say this one is good but not great. I love the Characters and hate the final page..."
2,"Christina Dodd can be great, but...","Hope Prescott has a problem...she's a terrible bigot. She decides immediately that Zach is an evil despot because of hearsay and (it seems) because he's _rich_...which we all know means he must be evil because he employs 100s of people and doesn't give all his money away. She never took the time to make up her own mind about him. Not only that; she bad-mouths him to someone she thinks is in his employ (like her). I don't know about you, but in my experience that's not professional behaviour and her intolerance made me dislike her. I don't blame him for not telling her who he is after she jumps in insulting him the first time they talk. As it turned out, he was kind of a jerk sometimes, but that's besides the point. I think it was supposed to be a funny misunderstanding, but it just made me read her as shallow."
2,Unsatisfying....,This confirms my suspicion that Dodd is much better at historicals than contemporaries. I hope that she goes back to writing regencies and stays away from present day settings.Liked it but it is not her strong suit.
5,Loved this book,"I loved this book and the three that follow it. The lost siblings are what drive the heroine. Her sense of pride, and her drive to better herself, are to insure that she find her sisters and brother. This drive makes her a very admirable person. The hero starts out as an arrogant rich man who only wants to have sex with her but soon finds himself falling for her. This is a love story but it also talks about the anguish children feel when they have no answers to how they lost their families. I think Dodd did an excellent job in how the h described her life as a foster child and the sorrow and anger she feels over her losses. I liked this book very much and give it 5 stars"
3,Mixed blessing,"I bought this CD because the ""Big Bands"" LP was a winner in the '60s and it was a bit of nostalgia. Horrified to hear him in the other two discs,not suiting Buddy at all. If the big band CD had been on its own I'd have given it 5 stars. Incidentally it's not ""Gigi"" on disc two- it's Dindi (Jobim), pronounced ""jinji"" so what do the producers know?"
2,Mattel Baseball,"I was sad to discover this is not nearly as fun as its brother the Mattel Football handheld. The play modes are not well-defined: level one is too slow and level two is too fast even after hours of play. The buttons are much less durable feeling than one would expect as is the casing. Kitch value makes it cool to have on your coffee table, but most people pick it up, play it once or twice, and say the same thing ""where's the football one like this?"""
5,Up,"It's game is a fun use of time. It also helps with hand eye coordination, fine motor skills, and can be shared with others."
1,baseball,Not at all what I had in mind. The baseball game I was thinking of was the one where two people played and one person controlled the pitcher and the other person controlled the hitter. It came in a beige control box. Very disappointed in this game. Not classic enough for me.
1,An Unhappy Customer,"I purchased this game for my grandson thinking that he would enjoy it because I had an old baseball game that I had purchased for my daughter about twenty years ago from Sears and he really enjoyed it. It was a great game. This new version game from Mattel is lousy to say the least. It is cheaply made, does not have any graphics, is not user friendly, and is a piece of junk. I would send it back but the cost and aggrevation is not worth the purchase price. My suggestion to anyone that is thinking about purchasing it is don't waste your money. If I could I would rate it a zero!!!"
5,Rod Stewart & The Faces In Their Shining Hour,"Just to buy this for the sake of hearing ""Stay With Me"" is worth the price of admission alone. A great album by one of the original party bands."
4,Yee-Gads! Fifty-nine bucks!?!!!,"Yeah, I just waded through 18 pages of schlocky overcommercialized repackagizations of Rod Stewart to find this one... and it's only available as a rare find for almost sixty bucks. I liked it, still have the vinyl packed away somewhere, but no I won't pay that much. Hope they release this one as MP3 downloadable and bring the price into the realistic zone."
5,What a great night!,"This was our first time trying a murder mystery party, and we had lots of fun with it! If the prospect of looking for costumes for one of these events seems intimidating, you should try this game -- a draped bedsheet or fabric looks very toga-like, add sandals and the optional laurel crown and you're finished! The roast didn't appeal to us so instead I made a vegetarian lasagna, caesar (of course) salad, garlic bread and tiramisu. We had lots of fun unraveling the clues as the evening went on. I would recommend this game to anyone who would like to have a fun and unusual evening with friends."
4,dat boy grace,"grace showed his skills on this album out of 16 cuts 13 are off the chain. he got help from screw up click members h.a.w.k,big moe,al-d,z-ro,wood,enjolie,l.o.s,and yungstar. this is a good c.d. and grace should have gotten alot more love for this album because it was one of the best albums to come in 2000."
3,S.U.C 2 THE FINISH,"AS ONE OF THE MORE UNDERATED MEMBERS OF THE SCREWED UP CLICK DAT BOY GRACE SHOWED UP ON HIS FIRST ALBUM CRUMBS 2 BRICKS. OUT OF THE 16 SONGS ON THE ALBUM 13 OF THE SONGS ARE VERY GOOD.THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM IS CALLED THIRD COAST G'S RIDE ON 4'S AND 3'S IS REAL TIGHT IT FEATURED'S Z-RO AND WOOD. HE ALSO HAS A SONG WITH ENJOLI CALLED RIDE WITH A PLAYA IT'S A GOOD SONG TO. AND THEIR A SONG CALLED CAN'T STOP WITH AL-D,LOS,MR,3-2,AND WOOD THAT'S REAL TIGHT. GRACE SHOWS ALOT OF SKILLS ON HIS FIRST PROJECT AND THERE IS A SONG WITH H.A.W.K,WOOD,AND LOS CALLED THIRD COAST BABY AND IT'S A REAL JAMMER."
2,Disappointment,"What a cheat! The songs are good titles, but these are definitely NOT taken from the Andrews Sisters' best performances."
2,not at all like Memory Crash,"While this is an album of technically perfect flamenco guitar, if you like Memory Crash and are searching for more of the same look somewhere else. This is an album of backround music for a Cirque Du Soleil show. Very good but no rock here."
3,"NOT flamenco, but growing on me","This is NOT a spanish guitar sounding kind of thing, and it's nothing like previous employer Billy Idol's stuff either.The guitar tone doesn't have that steel twanginess I expected, which is kind of bothering me.But that said, the album is growing on me. Not bad."
5,WOW,"I've always liked flamenco music but it's never hit me quite like Flamenco A Go Go. Man this guy can play! From the sweet melody lines to the lightning fast licks, i'm sold. Our Man In Istanbul is a killer. I loved the music start to finish. Check this cd out. If you are a fan of superb guitar playing, do not miss this one."
2,The next John Tesh,"Based on the positive reviews, I purchased this album in the hopes of hearing some great guitar with an international and/or latin flavor. Instead, I heard something that was more akin to John Tesh and Yanni (not that I own any of their albums, but I've heard the infomercials...) While there are a couple good songs, and certainly some fine guitar playing, I found the tracks ruined by the insertion of strings, disco-pop beats, and synthesizers a-la Tesh. Some of the pieces sounded more appropriate for a Turkish disco. After a couple times listening to it, I finally gave it away as a Christmas present to someone I know who is a Tesh fan, as I could not isten to it any more."
2,Suckered by his great piece on Sounds of Wood & Steel,"Steve Stevens definitely has style on this CD and technical prowess, but the songs lack memorable melodies (save track #9) that make great CD's replayable. I wholeheartedly recommend his track, Sadhana, on Windham Hill's Sounds of Wood and Steel. That's why I bought this table coaster. That is an amazing track."
2,flameco a go-go,i was disapointed. His compositions had some great ideas that he just didn't follow thru.
5,Beyond Talent,These guys rock. You have got to listen! Technical rock is the best in the world. You have to check it out!
5,Blast of Guitar Creativity,"Flamenco A Go-Go is not so much about Steve Steven's guitar playing (which is stupendous) as it is about the total flaming fabric of sound Steve weaves. The whole thing has a vaguely flamenco, or arabian feel to it. There's also a hint of 50's spy thriller in it. Some song are blasting torrents of acoustic flamenco with strong backing, others are soft acoustic melodies with solo flute backing. But even that soft track whacks you when you least expect it with a harder rock section. There's even a vocal track -- in some kind of arabic! -- incredibly, it fits right in. Altogether it's a roller coaster ride of melody and composition.If you have some firm idea about what you are expecting, don't get this CD -- it won't match up. It's unlike any other CD, even from Steve. But if you can keep an open mind, you will heartily enjoy this wide-ranging flamenco-guitar-rock album."
3,Confused But Happy,"The music of the 50s is well-represented in this compilation. Unlike some sets, each song is an original by the original artist(s). I would have had no trouble giving 5-stars to this set except for one problem. The labeling is very confusing. Each disc is given a disc number and a separate volume number. The numbers do not correspond in any way. Although there are only 5-discs, one disc is numbered ""6"". The list of songs on a particular disc is sometimes different than the same numbered disc indicated on the package. It is absolutely necessary to replace each disc in its particular case after playing to avoid further confusion."
5,Such an Unbelievable New Band,"These guys, the vines, sound alot like the Strokes with more distortion and grunge-influence. They are already stars in England and they're native Australia, and since the success of an indie act in Britain usually is followed by success in America(The Strokes & White Stripes) , these guys should be huge in a year or two, after their debut album comes out Summer 2002. Really, these guys are unbelievable. Beautiful melodies and rock intensity. Easily as good as the Strokes and just as cool. Buy it."
2,A disappointing sequel,"This book could have been a lot better. Its predecessor was an OK fantasy book, and I expected at least as much from this one. Unfortunately Ring of Intrigue doesn't live up even to its mediocre promise and ends up being rather annoying and dull.Mikheyel is the central point of the book and its best part. His emotional tangles are the most interesting portion of the tale and we are drawn into the book, if only at brief times. Plotlines from the first book are left hanging. Instead the book gives us pages of Khoratum dancers who want to dance again (please!), rulers making idiotically simple plots, etc. Its all played out and dull.If the rest of the series is going to be this lackluster, I wouldn't advise anyone to pick it up. Let's hope that the final volume does better with these themes and improves on both the mediocre first and the disappointing second."
2,Entertaining but a little flat,"Perhaps I expected too much, but I found the music lacking melodies and presented on the same level (no drama) . O.K. for getting to know the composer, but not for repeated listening. G. Koves"
5,Just what I expected,Looks and sounds great. I read the reviews on blu-ray.com before buying which were very good needless to say. Looks great on the Plasma and the surround sound is excellent. I wish I didn't have neighbors to worry about.
5,Easily the best of the series.......,"Aliens is the best of the series..... James Cameron uses his talents well in the casting and the special effects of this film.... To truly understand his vision you really need to see the uncut version.... Like the Abyss, and T-2 there is too much lost information that is important to the story. Cameron should not mess with perfection, and release his pictures uncut from the start..... I can't waiot to see the uncut Titanic!!"
5,This movie rocks!,"Forget Star Wars! This is the movie to own! Finally its getting justice and being released on DVD!!! Franky, I'd rather stay home and watch this then the Phantom Menace.. but hey, thats me. Buy this movie and you WON'T be dissapointed!"
5,The most intense movie of all time.,"This and the Terminator movies are James Cameron's true masterpieces --- not that silly Titanic movie. Aliens is the most gut-renchingly intense movie I've ever seen by far (second only to Terminator 2, also directed by James Cameron). It offers it all: Incredible action, believable characters, excellent direction and sound, good acting, and it's actually quite frightening, too. Totally blows the other Alien movies away."
5,At last the theatrical release!,"I must be one of the few people that, while finding 'director's cuts' interesting, still prefer to have the original theatrical release of a film. Now I have the theatrical release of Aliens I'm a happy man. I liked the tighter pace and even one less piercing scream from Newt is a bonus in my book.Of course, with this DVD you can have the pleasure of either version of the movie as you wish!"
4,Aliens,"The first half of this film is like the first one. It's very slow and focuses more on scaring us rather than thrilling us. But then the second part kicks in, and the action never lets up.This film does that rare little thing that not many sequels can do: it surpasses the original. Everything about the film is better. The effects, the action and of course, the Aliens. They are more convincing this time around, due to a great blend of animatronics and puppetering, and as a result we are allowed to see more of them.Also, this film introduces us to the Alien Queen. She is one nasty mother ******. Also, I think that she was actually designed by the director of the film, James Cameron, as well as many other things. So this is HIS film, in every sense of the word.The acting is great, but the film can slow down at times, which does hamper your viewing pleasure. The additional seventeen minutes are good, though. I thought that they made the film better."
5,"Aliens, impregnating a great sci-fi movie onto a DVD","This movie has a combination of everything: Sci-fi, Action, a little bit of humur, and 1 terrifying chest-hugger of horror. I can't forget the first time I watched it. In fact, I consider it a legendary movie of the 20th century. It set a new standard for all new sci-fi movies. Tribute to James Cameron (Titanic, Terminator 2, Aliens) and H. R. Giger."
3,"Big, loud, coarse, stupid, and moderately entertaining","This movie will not be winning any artistic achievement awards any time soon. Neither does it function as a piece of entertainment that makes you think. It's best to check your brain at the door before viewing this one. The characters are almost ridiculously stupid, and the ""space marines"" act like a bunch of children with guns as opposed to trained professionals. Of course, it's only a movie, but Cameron could have given us just a smidgen of more depth."
2,defacing a classic....,"Enough with ""Director's Cuts"" and ""Special Editions"" already! Why has the DVD revolution become an excuse to shovel in useless ""bonus"" footage from the cutting room floor? Films are historical and artistic documents, and are meant to be seen they way they were originally released. ""Aliens: the Special Edition"" is a glaring example of this. You can argue up and down as to the merits of the 17 extra minutes of footage (I, for one, think they dilute the plot, hamper the pacing, and leave less to the viewer's imagination), but the fact remains that this is not ""Aliens"" as it was intended to be. If you're a purist, steer clear of this one. (That is, until the marketeers decide to make a few extra bucks by putting out an ""Aliens: the Theatrical Release"" someday)."
1,Received Damaged disks,The movie I received was damaged and refused to play past 1 hour. Tried to play it on a different device with same outcome. Waste of money. Extremely dissatisfied.
3,Aliens.,"In this sequel(James Cameron did unfortunately), Aliens is longer,More action packed than suspenseful.That's not to say it's a bad movie(Not like avatar) far from it. Lance Henriksen does a great job.And Sigourney Weaver is back,still ugly but with more hair this time. I enjoyed the movie,although not as much as ALIEN."
4,An even better version of best film of the Alien series.,James Cameron's Alien movie has always been my favorite of the 4 and this Special Edition makes it even better. Though the additional scenes weaved into this film are not nearly as crucial as the added scenes are to the Special Edition of The Abyss (still my favorite Cameron film) they're great nevertheless. Particularly fascinating is the scene in which he colonists first encounter the aliens (although it isn't the full-on battle that you are expecting) and the scene in which Ripley learns what happened to her daughter after her 57 year deep space sleep (a scene which aired in a CBS showing a few years ago). The first is a terriifying and low key foreshadowing device and the other is heartbreaking. The all out battle scenes are wonderfully extended and there are a couple of other delightful talk scenes involving the grunts. This version of Aliens is a thrill to watch and makes it fresh again no matter how many times you've seen it before.
5,The butt -kicking sequal to Alien,This movie is without a dout the best movie in the Alien series. It's totally awsome. It is just dripping with action and gunfire and all that stuff. Very realistic special effects and a very cool looking Alien. Also you finally get to see just where all the eggs come from and meet the extreme mother Alien. Run out and see this movie as soon as possible. Cause' this time it really is war...
5,Aliens-the best action movie ever made,"I first saw Aliens a couple of years ago, and I fell in love with it. It had everything an action movie needs: violence, language, a couple of jokes(Hudson), and best of all, guns, lots of guns. The special effects are wonderful in this movie. They surpass most of the special effects in movies today, and this movie was made almost 15 years ago. Ripley is rescued from her first encounter with the aliens, and she later decides to go with the marines to LB-421. The marines arrive there and there is no sign of civilian life. They discover a colony of aliens, but they are too late, they're already under attack. And then comes the violence. They have to fight to get out of there and they're low on ammo. What could be better? The answer: nothing. This movie is far superior to the other movies in the series. This is a must see for all action fans."
5,Awesome Alien Bashing movie !!!,"This is the best i have ever seen,alien-bashing is never been this cruel...arrghhhhh..!!"
5,Best of the Alien movies...,"This is one is a must have movie for any new BD player. Very good picture quality, awesome sound and great price."
1,Aliens - hd,"Movie = Great,digital copy = terribleI've purchased the digital copy of this movie and it has horrible ""streaming"" capabilities. I've tried to watch it 4x now and each time (over the course of 2 weeks) has always lead to pauses every 15 seconds or less. I've purchased many digital copies of movies (with great sucess) and rented quite a few but this is the only one to give me real trouble. I paused it for about 5 minutes and that kinda helped but not completely, this 'pausing' problem still plagues me.I'm quite upset as this is such a great film.Amazon? wtf?"
3,17 minutes of extra footage...,"I love this movie, but the 17 extra minutes totally ruin it. They remove every ounce of mystery and subtlety from the film, and it proves that James Cameron doesn't understand the necessity of an editor (this is further evidenced by Titanic). The reinstated scenes were left out for a reason, and the producers of this DVD should have recognized that and set them off under the Special Features section. Instead we're forced to watch these scenes destroy a great movie. Stick with the original."
1,putrid!,"This sequel to ALIEN displaces scares for ""action."" I got such a headache watching after the first few minutes. The killing of the aliens looked like a bunch of exploding fireballs utilizing quick-cut camera style filming, which mistakes creating confusion for creating excitement."
4,Why it took so long?,I have seen the director's cut of aliens and I liked it. Although I felt that some scenes should of been in the final cut; I was glad that most of the weren't. If you are a big fan of ALIEN movies as I am get the director's cut today.
5,One of James Cameron's best.,"The best Alien movie of the saga. The best thing I enjoyed about this movie is it had a great cast. Besides Sigourney Weaver they had Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen,and one of my favorite actors Bill Paxton. It had alot of action. Unlike Alien and Alien3 it didn't have alot of talking scenes. The death scenes are so dramatic . Good movie see it."
5,How a sequel should be done,"Not wanting to take on an already perfect original master director/writer James Cameron took a different direction while remaining honest to Alien. The result is just a perfect combination of ""get even"" action and suspense.When the Marines are sent in to clean up the aliens they find out quickly that superior training and weapons are no match for speed, cunning, and numbers. Cameron quickly turns this self-confident ho-hum ""bug hunt"" mission into a disaster that quickly becomes a fight for survival. And it's a really serious fight. I can't think of a better treatment for a sequel. It complements and honors the original. Too bad Alien 3 wrecked the trend.Also check out the extras on the DVD. Very cool."
5,My All-Time Favorite Horror Movie (Or Is It An Adventure?),"I only saw ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" in the series; I would be surprised if either of the later two could surpass ""Aliens"". In some ways, this is a formula sequel, bringing out memorable parts of the original, like the chest buster scene, the egg, and the destruction of an android. But it did not strictly stay with the formula, and came across as much as an adventure as a horror movie.I also enjoyed the relationship between Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) and Newt (Carrie Henn). Paul Reiser and Michael Biehn also shone in this picture."
5,Totally Awsome!!!,"If you have not seen this Special Edition version, you are missing out! It has many new scenes that are well deserved to be in the final cut."
5,"Cameron's best film. (Yes, including the sinking ship movie)",Non-stop action with characters you truly feel for. The cut scenes add to the drama. Run don't walk and buy it today.
3,WATCH OUT,"Use EXTREME caution when buying either ""Alien"" or ""Aliens"" on blu-ray in the single disc formats. There are virtually NO BONUS FEATURES included. All of the great bonuses are only available in the big Blu-Ray box set that has all 4 Alien films (which sucks because most people dont want or need Alien 3 or 4). I waited until ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" were available individually and after purchasing them, was disappointed to learn that the bonus stuff wasnt included. It really sucks. I guess its a good way to force people to cash out for the box set. I wish the companies wouldnt do that kind of stuff."
4,Aliens Collectors Edition : Where's the sound?,"I am forced to give this DVD 4 stars because it is probably the best sci-fi sequel of all time (forgive me, George, Empire Strikes Back is a close second). However, it peeves me when a rerelease that is supposed to be of higher quality comes out and the sound is untouched. I already own the disc and would not buy another when the sound has not been upgraded to DTS, et al. I was accused of being an ""audiophile"" way back in the days of vinyl (that is one who is more interested in tweeking expensive equipment than listening to music) and this could be true. However, sound is at least 1/2 of the home theater experience and it should never be ignored."
4,an over looked sequel,"On the list of great SEQUELS (the third was a stinker) this takes us back to where Ripley just barely got away from before, and puts us face to face with the queen mother. One of my favorites, a must for the movie collector and sci-fi fanatic."
5,The best of the series,"I think this is the best of the series of Alien movies. The addition of the new scenes add to the film & help some of the continuity. They also freshen it up & almost make it a new movie. Having the digital 5.1 sountrack available is great although, at least on my system, you have to remember to select it from the menu. The DVD transfer seems well done too."
2,"Classic film, shame about the 'special edition'","The point of an editor within a film is to weed out uneeded material and ensure the film works and runs seamlessly. Maybe if I had never viewed the original, watching the special edition may not seem so bad to watch.Most of what is added stands out from the rest of the film...it seems weakly scripted but for the most part is irrelevant and spoils the impact for some of the scenes.Unfortunatley now the original edition is never shown on television or is available to on DVD. Is there a way to view the original without the additional footage on DVD?...there should be."
3,Major Goof. No DTS Audio Track. Spare Us The Excuses Fox!,"Producers of this disc set claim there was not enough disc space to include the DTS track due to the 154 min. special edition run time. I find this extremely hard to believe. The Terminator 2 Ulimate Edition DVD is two minutes longer than Aliens SE and that disc has seamless branching, an audio commentary, Dolby Digital EX, DTS ES, and the picture was superb. Bunch of BS if you asked me. The lack of a DTS track on this release is a major goof and, as such, just dropped the title from my reference list.Blunders like this are nothing new to 20th Century Fox. Keep in mind, they are the same bunch of bozos that gave us the non-anamorphic special edition DVD of The Abyss.Get a clue Fox!"

4,Monsters&Mayhem,"I bought the movie for my Daughter.It ok,my taste in movies has changed. I would not recommend it for younger children.There are way too many bloody scenes."
3,Not nearly as good as the original. Poor acting.,"Sigourney Weaver is the only really good cast member of this movie. The little girl is 2nd. Otherwise, the acting is just horribly bad.The movie has none of the subtle menace of the original. The original was a work of art. This is just a (too-long) popcorn flick.The special effects are very nice. But please, the props are ""dated"" because Ridley Scott's high standards of set design were allowed to erode. This is how you raise the budget hugely, yet end up with a cheaper-looking movie as a result.Don't get me wrong, this is an entertaining movie despite some horrible, cringe-worthy acting and poor editing. But the original was a masterwork. Don't confuse the two."
2,"Was disappointed in product, not service","I purchased this DVD, in order to add to my scifi collection. The price was good and I purchased the item brand new. Received the item within a few days, GREAT service. HOWEVER, the DVD itself, gets stuck or skips. It's not my player, its the disc itself. Was extremely disappointed because this is the first DVD I have purchased from Amazon that was faulty."
3,good? yes -- but overpraised,"i saw the first movie upon its release and didnt like it. accordingly until now, i have stayed away from any of its sequels (what are there, about 19 now?) well, i kinda enjoyed this, but as with its progenitor, i found nothing exciting or innovative or tense. just a decent run-of-the-mill monster in confined quarters movie, and not in any way the equal of ""the thing"" (either the howard hawks or john carpenter versions). sigourney looks good tho."
2,Overrated series!,"Almost everybody I know who's seen this movie loved it. But I have to be honest...this movie is so totally boring, I almost fell asleep when I saw it. And what's the point with letting this movie last for 2 1/2 hours. What a total waste of time. I haven't seen the first one, but the third wasn't so bad. The only thing which is keeping me from rating this movie 1 star, is the killing of Bishop (Lance Henriksen)."
5,Aliens,of course this is the ultimate movie - the only reason I rented it was because I could not find my DVD
1,I cant play it on any of my HD devices!!!,All my other HD movies and shows work. Why doesn't this one?! I would like my money back for this rental!
1,Video Will Not Play,Not a Review for the movie but the instant watching version.This is the only video in my video library that will not play.Waste of money
