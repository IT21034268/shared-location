3,Not as bad as I feared,"Having read the reviews and heard the word of mouth about this book, this was the first of the series that I've considered waiting until the paperback was released. Having succumbed (I figured with nine others in hardback, it would seem silly to wait now), I can honostly say that it is nowhere as bad as I thought it would be. True, hardly any time is covered and the plot barely plods along, but I have to admit that Jordan's writing continues to have me turning pages.If he could manage to pump books like this (in terms of no where plot movements) at least once a year, I wouldn't complain. Having waited years for this one though cost the book some stars."
2,Needed Something to Happen,"The book was slow from the beginning until only a fourth of the book was left. It started to pick up and things looked like they might get interesting, then it ended. Don't buy this book until it comes out in paperback. Seriously absolutely nothing was accomplished in this book, other than to set things up for book 11."
3,It is still a good book,"After reading some of the reviews for this book i had to write one myself to give it some justice. First I would like to point out that the publishers were pushing Jordan very hard to get this out quick, and on that note. The book itself is good. There really is not much to it, but if you have read the series then it has all the aspects that drew us in in the first place. It does a good job of showing us what is going on and some of the plot developments. On the other hand i too have been waiting for a while for it to come out and was hoping for much much more. Compared to some of his other books, this one is lacking some of the excitement, but it does do a good job of bringing us up to date and setting an exciting scene for book elevn."
1,The Prologue,"Before I read this book, i was thinking about how the prologues in each of the WOT books seems longer than the book before... Then I read this one, a book where the prologue should be entirely deleted and the rest of the book would serve as one. While the story had not advanced significantly in this series in some time, that was fine with me because things were happening in the world that were interesting. Crossroads of Twilight, however, contains virtually nothing that contributes to the world, no events of note until the last page. Filler I can take. This book was sub-par filler."
1,Crossroads of Twilight by Robert Jordan,"After waiting 3 years to buy this book. I bought it the first time I spotted it in a bookstore. I took it home and read through all many hundreds of pages and when I completed the book, I knew nothing more than I knew after I read the previous book. This book was a big disappointment. Nothing was solved, no new details were revealed.Maybe if somebody gives me the next two or three books that it will take before the author finishes this story, I might read them, but not otherwise. Ten books is way too many for a series that builds book upon book."
2,ZZZZZzzzzzzzzzz,"[YAWN]... You'd think in a book with 10 different story lines going on at once that at least one of them would be exciting. Or at least semi-interesting. The fact that I finished this 680 page sleep-fest is a true feat of sheer will power. If this guy doesn't pick up the pace soon he's going to drop dead before we get anywhere interesting. Unfortunately if you follow the series you're almost obligated to read it. Though you could probably just skip onto the next one without being horribly lost. I only gave this book 2 stars because this is my favorite series, but c'mon Jordan, let's get movin'."
1,"Indeed ""Glacial Movement"" is a perfect descriptor.","The only highlight of this book is Mat trying to ""court"" Tuon and I got a chuckle. Perhaps because Mat is my favorite character although he is less of his sarcastic witty self than normal. Other than that nothing happens. I hate the parts dealing with Aes Sedai....incredibly boring and repetitive with no action. This makes up 500 pages of the book. I am glad I read the thing in Books-A-Million rather than pay money for it."
1,Save your $30,"Another 690 pages of drivel. The purpose of a book is to tell a story, but with Crossroads of Twilight all Jordan does is waste paper. This book does not develop characters, advance plot, or even inform - all it does is spout melodrama. A writer of his talent and experience should be flogged for forcing this garbage upon us. I promise, I'll get the next one from my local library before I even think of laying out money for it. Squeeze extra royalty payments out of that, you pretentious goon."
2,Jordan lost in his own mess.,"With Eye of the World, Jordan got off to a pretty good start. The next few books in the series were pretty good as well, but after that it is a pretty linear decline into mediocrity. Crossroads of Twilight is definately the worst book in the series thus far. The entire book seems to set the stage for yet another book, which won't come for another 2 years. I had thought Winter's Heart had enough explanation of the present. I was hoping that Crossroads of Twilight would add something of substance. It's depressing that the series that really got me into fantasy in the first place has fallen so far. The only reason to read this book is the fact that it is book 10 in WOT; it would have no hope of ever standing alone."
1,Why not one star?,"If the stars served as a proxy for literary appeal, than I would say one out of five people might find this over-priced paper-weight worth purchasing.When the series began, the tension, the interplay of key characters, the evolution of myths and metaphysics proved to be an engaging mix. I loved the second book of this series.The current incarnation is insipid. I wanted this book to end so badly so that I could hurl into my fireplace and purge myself of the experience. The taint was cleansed in the prior book, and now has attached itself to the remains of this utterly tiring tome of irritation.I want the ""Final Battle"" to come quickly and evaporate all the annoying, trite characters that deserve to die. There are no characters with any pathos, just random text following some meandering plot and filling a minimum page limit.Mr. Jordan, please conclude the WoT with a series of Cliffs Notes, I cannot bear to read another 700 pages of train of thought garbage."
1,crossroads of twilight,"i can not believe i paid money for this .... jordan has lost it and me as a fan. can you believe 24 chapters before the main person ( rand ) shows up? also, how did the male side of the one power get clean? i for one don't care if jordan ever finishes his too many story line epic,because i won't be buying them."
1,This must be a joke,"I understand the last person's thinking that this is a setup for what is to come. Unlike the last person, I do not believe that you need 3-4 books with 600+ pages to describe location and sub-characters. I can understand if Mr.Jordan decided to have the main character in his books. But one chapter for the main character(Rand)in this last installment is ridiculous. The characters that he delves more into are Perrin, Elayne, Mat and just about everyone else and their cousin. Mr.Jordan should be ashamed of himself. From the momentum of the first 4 books he was going so good. Now he is out of ideas and trying to milk his past successes for all that they are worth. Mr. Jordan, if you are listening, end the series sometime soon and move on to another profession."
1,Frelling Dren,"How very, very sad. Unlike the earlier books of this series I found this one extremely easy to put down. It was like sitting through a lecture on ""how is every character doing emotionally""I think I may in fact not even bother with the next book."
2,A Quick Analogy,"Once I ate a BBQ Pork sandwich, and boy it was really good. So good that I ate another one, and another and another. Finally after ten of the same BBQ Pork sandwiches they didn't taste quite as good. That doesn't mean it was bad, it just was not as good as the first one. I'm really not sure what the cook is doing in the back but next time I come to eat I may just order something else."
1,Crossroads to NoWhere,"This is a huge waste of money and time. The story is going nowhere at a snail's pace. I love this world and the characters and I realize this is Mr. Jordan's golden goose, but there is a limit to how many of these filler books people are willing to purchase or read. Rand barely figures in this volume, Nynaeve and Lan are afterthoughts. The chapters written around Elayne and Aviendha are truely teeth gratingly annoying and tedious and the chapters devoted to Egwene and the assorted, and impossible to keep straight, Aes Sedai she consorts with are not much better. Even the usually reliable Matrim is unentertaining and bogged down. Don't waste your time, save your $$$ for the next volume, maybe something will actually happen."
1,How does someone write so much about so little?,Note to Jordan -- YOU NEED TO MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN in every book. 700 pages of excruciating detail about everyone sitting around waiting has made me no longer care what happens -- this is my last Jordan book.
1,It's all about the money,"I was personally very disappointed by Crossroads of Twilight. It seems increasingly evident that Robert Jordan and his publishers only have a profit in mind when writing this series. There was absolutely nothing of interest in the latest book and I would not recommend this book to anyone. I ""was"" a diehard Wheel of Time fan, but now I am very disenchanted. For anyone who is interested, George Martin's series is a much better read and it is obvious he cares more for the quality of his work, than the expected profits from who knows how many more sequels Jordan and his money grubbing publishers wish to make."
1,Book 10's Alternate Title ...,"Jordan is starting to become the Clancy of the fantasy world. Jordan's writing would imply that he doesn't hear any of our criticisms because we make him a best-selling author with each book. Success begets arrogance, which begets this drivel. The more I read this work, the more I miss Tolkien, Martin and even, Jordan (books 1-6). Well, I appreciate the chance to read 680 pasges where each story is take forward a few weeks, with basically nothing happening during those weeks."
1,Long Wait for Very Little,"I like Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series very much. His ability to pull the readers into a situation with the detail of his descriptions is un-paralleled.However, when those details overwhelm the story line it can ruin the book. In Crossroads of Twilight he has produced so much detail and filler that it is extremely difficult to pick out anything story wise happening.Needless to say, I am very disappointed. There is a lot of good in this book but it is buried in what would otherwise be considered filler. Detail is good when it is used to accent the story line or when it is used to bury/or hide important ""clues"" to the series mysteries. It is not good as filler instead of story line. Please RJ, do not make us wait so long again for so little."
2,Terribly diappointing,"If you're looking for a continuation of the action from the first nine books, don't bother reading this one. Basically, it reacts to the event which ended the 9th book and advances the story only slightly. I was very disappointed! It seems that Mr. Jordan does not know how to end the story and is only selling books at this point."
1,Cash cow,"Jordan is milking this cash cow for everything its worth.Half the book takes place before the end of the last book, Nothing happens in this instalment of the Wheel of Money.You could skip this one and wait 3 years for the next one and not miss anything!!!Jordan has me hooked on this series.(I've been reading it for 10 years), but it will be a cold day in hell before i purchase any other book he writes."
1,I GIVE UP,"I have to confess . . . I read this book hoping against hope that it would progress the story, tie up loose ends and begin to weave together the tapestry. It does none of those things.I thought the first few books were darn near Tolkien . . . the last three or four books really have nailed down Jordan's legacy. A man for whom no story is too long, no trite phrase can be repeated enough, and ulimately a man who cares more about selling copy that writing.I WILL NEVER READ ANOTHER JORDAN BOOK AGAIN . . . in contrast, I will read everything written by David Gemmell or George Martin."
1,Six hundred pages of.....nothing.,"Well. I'd say it's about time to give Jordan a round of applause. He has managed to do what few even come close to---write a full length fantasy novel and have -nothing- happen, and have -none- of the plotlines resolved, or even being -close- to being resolved!The repititions are grating on the nerves, the pages spent describing how to launder silk (among other things) are unbearable, and the lack of PLOT is appalling. Did I mention that I was falling asleep trying to push my way through the first four hundred pages, hoping against hope that something, ANYTHING would happen. Nope. And then it just ends, and it's like you're staring at the book like ""Oh my God this book is beyond horrible""Please, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK. If you -must- read it get it from the libary. But honestly you can just skip it. I know I'm never buying a hardcover Wheel of Time book again."
1,Wot CoT,"This book was said to be in good condition, but when I received it, the spine was broken and the pages appeared to be water damaged. I was very upset that I was mislead to the condition of this book. Every other time I purchased a used book on amazon the book was in the condition that it was described as. I am very upset and will never buy again from this seller."
5,Great Book,"I got the book on time, condition as stated, and packaged very well. Would buy from them again"
2,600+ pages where nothing happens,"Warning: Spoilers ahead.Nothing goes anywhere! Except some good stuff between Mat and Tuon. For that, I give the book two stars. Otherwise... I'm a fast reader, but the fact that I finished this book /this/ fast means that I did a lot more skimming then actual reading. The number of people who do not appear, or have only a cameo, is astounding. Include in that ALL the Forsaken except Mesaana, Nynaeve, Cadsuane, Fain, Slayer, Thom, *Rand and Min* - heck, RJ spends more time talking about what one of Graendal's stooges is doing then he focuses on Rand. Everyone seems to take the destruction of Shadar Logoth calmly enough, the rebels are still sitting outside Tar Valon, Mat's still on the run, Perrin's still hunting for Faile... *yawn* Can we get some plot advancement? Maybe?Checking it out at the library is definitely the way to go with this one. It's not worth the cover price."
1,Unbelievably boring,"I CANNOT believe how anyone could have appreciated this installment. The people who write good reviews MUST be lying, or voluntarily blinding themselves. I really had to force-feed my brain to keep on reading this rag.How could this be? I am flabbergasted by the downfall of the wheel of time (no caps). I still remember yelling with surprise and delight all through the first four books. Those days are long gone. The last books (generally speaking) were so loaded with ridiculous and pathetic twists and comments that reading them sometimes made me uncomfortable.Jordan MUST finish off this mortally wounded epic, it just plain ol'sucks."
1,Worst Book I Have Skimmed in Years,"I have stopped buying Jordan's books, refusing to feed the monster, so to speak. Instead, I get copies from my local library. What a boring book. Absolutely the worst book I have read in years. A note to some of the reviewers who posted here in support of this book: please don't get mad at my for not being able to finish this book. Its not my fault, really. Its just that its so horrible, I couldn't continue. Instead I skimmed the first sentence of nearly every paragraph. And I couldn't tell that anything happened. Is everyone in Jordan's world as fashion conscious as a writer for Vogue? I can't imagine Tolkien taking a moment from the Battle of Helm's Deep to have Aragorn have internal dialogue about how he disapproved of Gimli's hair or blushed at thinking how tight Legolas' leggings might be.I was amazed that this book was even published. Jordan violates every single rule of writing fiction, the first of which is to treat you audience with respect."
4,A necessary evil,"Crossroads of twilight is essential to the series, so I rate it pretty high. I also felt a sense of dissapointment at the lack of conclusions, but maybe that means 11 will be ramped up, or maybe it means that the plots have reached a point where Tarmon Gaidon is the only possible conclusion.Also on the bad side, Perrin is my least favourite of the three two rivers boys and the book focuses quite heavily on him. On the plus, the fallout of Rand's actions are really starting to become apparent at this point and I have always loved the way Jordan doesn't shy away from those consequences."
1,SLOW!!!,"The problem as we see in the tenth book of this series, is that it is in the 10th book. The series was only supposed to last 7 or 8, but like a literary sellout, Jordan takes a 5 million dollar advance to extend the series to 12. I don't know about you, but if I had a series outline that was 7 to 8, and I had to squeak 4 more books out, my series would have devolved into the utter meaningless, meandering drivel it has become too. The female characters have all the warmth of a snow pea, and grate like a rusty file, and the male characters wouldn't know how to handle these unrealistic women if their lives depended on it. I give up. With any luck, so will Jordan. Book 11 will be another garbage fest, with the ""payoff"" in book 12 bound to be a complete letdown. If you want to read a good long series, I recommend Jack Whyte's Camulod Chronicles."
1,"Please ""STILL"" Robert Jordan !","I just finished reading the tenth book, and if I could just get ahold of Mr. Jordan long enough to knock that ridiculous hat off his head, I might get SOME satisfaction out of the whole expierence! I simply cannot believe so little could happen in over 600 pages! I was stunned when Rand finally appeared on page 540...my god! I read the first 8 novels in a little over a month, and loved almost all of them. Now, after having to wait so long for this meandering waste, I am so upset..I can hardly type this! I actually found myself skimming page after page searching for any scrap of actual meaningful plot. I am also convinced that R. J. himself could not keep track of all those endlessly similar Aes Sedai names without the help of of computer program. Could somebody just tell me if Moraine is actually dead..so I can skip the rest?"
1,"Enough, already","Although I have nothing new to add to the vast majority of reviews already submitted, I just wanted to help bring the average rating down to where it belongs. The truly horrible, sad, and depressing fact about this series is that you could skip both this book and the last and not have missed a thing. A man who might have been one of the greatest fantasy writers ever is quickly being mired in mediocrity by the weight of the last 1500+ pages of garbage he has produced. I'd gladly wait 5 years between books if they could even approach the beginning books in this series. As it is, I'll wait for his next one to hit the discount table before I waste my money again."
1,"Disappointment, thy name is Jordan","As with many others, I was exceedingly disappointed with this book. I've been able to accept the relative lulls in the last couple of books, but this one was simply atrocious. How can ANYONE spend 680 words to say nothing? I don't understand it.Want my honest opinion? It is beginning to seem as though Mr. Jordan and company have determined that the WOT series is a goldmine, and they should play it out as long as possible. Well, guess what, folks? Keep up this sorry state of writing, and you're going to completely lose your audience.Mr. Jordan, dear sir, it is time to finally wrap up what you have begun. Or will you go down in flames, known forever as the author who couldn't end his story?"
2,Summary,"I can basically summarize the whole story in one line.Winter is almost over lets wait til Spring (aka next book) before we do anything.However, ignoring the snail's pace of the book, I must admit it is very well written. That is the reason why I gave it more than 1 star. However, if you do not find good grammar exciting or gratifying I do suggest you skip this book entirely. With nothing happening in this book, you won't miss a beat by reading the next book."
2,"Somebody get Jordan an Editor, PLEASE!!","I can't say I was entirely disappointed with COT--Jordan's recent efforts have been almost as unimpressive. It's simple, Jordan needs an editor to provide some adult supervision, to cut his prose and to demand he pull things together. He had 600+ pages to wrap up any one of a still multiplying number of plot lines. I appreciate suspense, character development, detailed descriptions, etc., but let's move the characters forward. I loved the first six books but have been struggling with the rest. I know he has some great ideas, but this book was a miss. It does little to advance the story and left me in doubt as to whether I'll plunk down 30+ bucks for the next one."
2,I feel like a cow,"With another drawn out book on my list of frustrations with this series which I once adored, I feel like a cow who is simply being milked for as much money as possible. I thought one of the most important aspects of the art of novel writing was to be good at telling a story from beginning to end, assuming there is one here. I am not convinced this is occurring with this long series. And since I doubt The Wheel of Time would end with eleven books, I suspect I will have to wade through two more books to find out how it all comes to a grand finale. How disappointing. I guess I can sum up my review in just one word: MOO."
1,Worst effort yet!,"As a fan of the series, I have been eagerly awaiting this novel. However I quickly realized that I probably should have spent my my money on a good haircut instead. Confusing,disjointed,rambling,inane,pretententious,and ultimately very boring are the adjectives that seem most apt.No suprises or series insights here.I find it very discouraging to see a well loved series go down the tubes"
2,Book Number 10,"Hey all,After reading books 1 to 9, I would say that Jordan's fiction has its fluctuations between exciting and slow. In the books 1-9 there has always been a balance, some books slightly more slow and others slightly more exciting.Book 10 however is a completely different case. I was disappointed, for majority of the first half of the book the only thing that kept me going was what had happened in book 9.All in all though, excluding a lot of the waffle, I would say that book 10 was satisfying. Not exciting, un-like books 1 to 9.Cheers,"
1,What a waste!,"This series had SO MUCH potential starting out and somewhere 2 or 3 books ago it just started going downhill.This latest book is a total disappointment. Nothing happens. I hate to say this but it is VERY obvious that Robert Jordon has run out of a good story to tell. Usually, handing off a story to another writer to finish spoils it. But in this case, it's hard to mess up a story that's not going anywhere in the first place. What a waste.I just read a review that says the next book will be a prequel? Wow... is this writer INTENTIONALY trying to disappoint all of his fans (well most are xfans now)"
1,Jordan does not know how to finish a story.,"I started reading these books quite a while ago. The first few were good, and then it started to go downhill. Although I like some of the characters, for the most part, I simply don't care any more. The other thing that I find to be infuriating is that he spends the first section of a book reviewing the previous books. This section has been getting larger with each installment. So now my strategy is to wait for the last book (27 or something) and just read that. Due to his fear of alienating people, he'll have a huge section on what I've missed since the last one that I read, and I'll just be able to skip to the last battle, assuming he ever gets there."
1,Save your money,I started the Wheel of Time with great enthusiasm. First few novels were excellent. As I have read more one word comes to mind FILLER. I will not waste anymore time on Jordan's realm until the end comes out. And even then I may just read the ending since I doubt I will be interested in much more!!!!!Jordan is commercialization at its worst...fight the power!
1,The Jordan Conspiracy,"I have a theory to explain the last five Wheel of Time books: Jordan died under mysterious circumstances in 1993. The publisher, Tor, hired a double to do book tours and then put together a COMMITTEE of hacks to keep cranking out Jordan books at the previous rate. They will continue to crank out books with no real plot resolution until the public (that means you) tires of the series and stops buying them. The committee will milk the series for all its worth.The only shortcoming of this theory is that I doubt that even a committee of aspiring authors could produce a book as boring as the ""Crossroads of Ennui."""
1,Just Because,"To be honest, I have little to say that some of the other reviews I read haven't already said, but because I feel completely bamboozled out of my hard-earned dollars, I wish to vent. This book is such a complete and total waste of time that I can only feel sorry for those of us who have stuck with this increasingly moribund series. How foolish to think that things were going to be different just because something finally happened at the end of the last one. This is by far the worse of the series, and if for any reason some innocent soul is thinking about starting to read this series, for God's sake save that person hours of unnecessary torment. The worse is I'm committed to reading the rest of this having invested this much time, but like others I vow to give no more money to Jordan, and I shall continue to think to myself, ""Ah, this is how NOT to move a plot along."" If you want intricate fanstasy plots that move quickly, I suggest everyone read Guy Gavriel Kay immediately."
1,So very disappointing,"I have been an unwavering fan of the Wheel of Time series, having re-read the first nine books three times. Now number ten comes along and it seems as though it is written by another author. That, or else Jordan has lost his inspiration and plot and is wallowing about. I find that hard to believe. He's a better writer than that. I hate to admit it, but it would seem that now that we are ""addicted"" to the series, we are going to get ""filler"" for the next few books, and line his pockets. So very disappointing."
1,Stop Buying the Books!,"I've already reviewed this book once a few months ago. It is simply awful! Review after review prior to and since mine say basically the same thing. Does anyone really want to just go on buying more of these endless plotless monstrosities? How about this...Anyone who agrees with me should write a ""review"" stating that he or she won't buy another volume of W.o.T unless the next one is the LAST one and finally ends this long overcooked story! It really is a shame because Mr. Jordan has talent....he has just left it in the safety deposit box where he keeps all the cash the publisher paid him to go on and on and on...."
2,The hamster is dead but the wheel is still turning.,"I have found that I am severely disappointed in this latest installation of The Wheel of Time. The series started out in such a magnificent fashion. The characters were likable, the plot advanced well and the story was entertaining and exciting. I couldn't put the first four books down. I read five through nine at a bit of a slower pace but they were still enjoyable although nearing book eight the characters have dissipated into whining people who could have solved some of their problems by simply talking to each other. Rand has gone from a likable youth to a whining and moaning young man. I know that his character has many pressures but he has hardly advanced as a character in the past few books."
1,Ignore Any Good Reviews.....,"This is a filler book of epic proportions.If you have a weak heart and like the idea of nearly 700 pages of conversation and description then this is the book for you. There is no action to speak of so you wont get too excited reading it.Like most of the other people giving this book bad reviews I have read books 1 to 9 and enjoyed them. Book 10 is just a vehicle for killing time and taking our money. Shame on you, Robert Jordan.To paraphrase a previous reviewer, anyone who gives the book more than one star either works for the publisher or is related to Robert Jordan."
1,Will Robert Jodan Just get on with it.,The wheel of time started as a great series but Jordan in his last few books has not progressed the story much rather he seems to have lost control of the threads and doesn't seem to know how to bring them together again. I loved the first 5 books but have struggled through the remaining. It is almost like he is milking the popularity of the series with a load of padded books- which is a shame given that the base story and concept is fantastic- hurry up and bring the plot together. I mean what did Rand do in the last book???
1,Fantasy Soap - As the Wheel Turns . . . .,"Phew. I finished. After reading 9 I remember telling myself to give this series a rest. Moment of weakness I guess.Basically this has become too long. Too many subplots. There are more named characters in this series then members of the Screen Actors Guild. It's impossible to keep track of who is doing what to whom. Definitely a soap opera. Time to converge all these subplots, The Wheel needs to turn a little faster.If you really want to finish up the series wait until the final book is published."
1,Intergenerational agreement,"For the first time in years, I have to agree with my dad who has also reviewed this book. It's a waste of time and trees. There is no movement of the plot, no action, no worthwhile character development, and no clear purpose other than to sell another doorstop-sized book. Most people who have read it have been able come to the same conclusion. Of the 1512 reviews to date, only 66 (4%) ""true believers"" thought it was 5-star great, while 939 (62%) thought it stunk at one star or less. It is interesting to note that while most of the negative reviews focused on the author's and the book's shortcomings, a majority of the avid fans used their review to attack the other reviewers."
1,Show about nothing = funny. Book about nothing = joke on me,"No one moves. there is an amazing artform developing here, for the lovers of null, inertia, stasis, nada, zip, nothing. No one in the entire almost 1000 pages actually does anything or goes anywhere. At least in the previous book (which was pretty close to stasis) some things occured to move the story along.There is one wonder and joy in book 10 of this series. Not reading book 10 in the series will leave you in exactly the same place starting book 11 as reading book 9 in the series left you. You wont have missed a single thing, and if by chance some detail or another *was* missed, you wont know it, because it had no consequence whatsoever.So if you have read 1 through 9, just skip 10 and go right to 11 when it comes out. After reading a few reviews to see if it was necessary to read either.my brief synopsis of events in book 10:and there you have it."
2,Wait,"This was a very disappointed reader. After reading RJ's books over the years I have slowly started to feel a sharp bitterness with his work. Mind I will read his work until his last book is published, but not with the same passion I once did. In Crossroads of Twilight, as in Winters Heart, the story seems to fade. It just seems that RJ is writing so that he can write another book. I won't give away plot or story line, but to say all the main players appear, though Rand isn't seen until three hundred pages in. Few questions are answered, though more are asked. And the end leaves you so twisted you feel like tossing the book across the room. With the probability that the next book won't come out till late 2005 this reader feels disheartened with ever seeing an end to what once was epic series with outstanding depth. Remember it started out as a series of only six books."
5,I liked it,Contrary to most I liked the book. It really sets everything up very well for the last battle. I can't wait for the next 2 books.
4,"Great book, yet disappointing","The series is AWESOME, yet this latest addition, which I got a prerelease copy was disappointing. Some of my favorite characters has very little or no lines and it gives the feel of being made for the next book that will come out. Generally it is great for people wanting a little escape from this world yet the pace is way too slow for my liking (covering 4 weeks of WoT time). Great for hardcore WoT fans yet casual readers might feel it boring. Some parts are infomative (ex: Mesanna with SH, Alviarin having an interesting experience etc.), what is great about it is that it has a bit more Mat part. GO MAT!"
2,I waited two years for this?!?,"It's official. The magic is gone. There was once a time when I couldn't put down an Eye of the World volume. Now, I can't wait for them to end.For those interested in purchasing Book 10 -- visit a bookstore and read the hardcover jacket. You'll get all of what happens in COT there, plus a couple mentions of things that don't.Lemme see... Mat moves about 30 miles up the road from where we last saw him. Perrin chases the Shaido a bit, stops to replenish his food supply, and frets about Faile. Elayne meets with a couple teenagers to gain their support for her bid for the Lion Throne. Rand does nothing. Egwene plots about how to retake the White Tower, and then is ridiculously captured.And that's it. Folks, it's getting ugly out there."
1,...breaks faith with the Wheel of Time fans.,"Crossroads of Twilight is an incredibly poor installment in the Wheel of Time Series. There is no plot movement. No revelations. No action. Well, not exactly. There is the cute plot line concerning how well Birgitte fills out her pants!However, I would not want to appear negative. The book does contain hundreds of multi-page descriptions of women's dresses, skirts, cloaks, jewelry, general appearance and eye and hair color. Most of these descriptions do explain how the women need to twitch, pull, smooth out and fondle everything to keep it all in place. Sadly, none of it contributes to the plot....My recommendation is to skip Crossroads of Twilight...."
2,Guess I'm in for the long haul,"Its a bit daunting to realize how long ago it was that I picked up the Eye of the World and signed myself up for this journey.While creating an epic story on a wonderfully grand style, Jordan is dragging this out for quite a bit.When my wife got this for me as a present I noticed that the book was shorter than others in the series and that was my first warning sign. Jordan seems to need 1000+ pages to get things to happen so it seemed book 10 would be ""treading water,"" which it is.I'll buy book 11 (in paperback - not hard cover) just because I like the characters & story, but I'm starting to doubt this story will be done in this decade."
1,And...nothing happened,I just wnat everyone to know nothing worth reading happens in this book. There are two or three small details that you will figure out in the next book and you won't have to read 800 pages of filler to find it out.
1,Time to End the Series,"Well, it seems the wheel of time needs to wind down and end this series. Without question, it has been the one of the best ever, however, this volume is evidence that you can take a good thing only so far. Mr. Jordan, please end the series now while you still have the respect of your readers.Very respectfully,Bill P."
2,The Wheel of Time Dithers,"Although the previous three books meandered to a degree, putting off action and reasonable directions for the characters and the story line,they at least continued to flesh out the characters and subplots in a reasonably efficient manner. While I finished Crossroads of Twilight,it was difficult to do so as the first two-thirds seemed to interminably describe and redescribe the same characters. It took 500 pages to reveal that the column of fire to the west was Rand's cleansing of the taint from male wielders of the power and destruction of Shadar Logoth, that had taken place in the previous book. The end of the wait for this volume was disappointing. Mr. Jordan needs to return to the crispness and quality of the first four books of this series and to finish the story."
1,Shame on RJ,"WOT was/is a good series. Now, RJ is just milking his fans for money. I spend [money] for a book. I expect some entertainment. So why was I grinding teeth the whole time I read it?There was no action. The story didn't advance. This book was boring, and uninspiring. Heck, he didn't even throw us a bone at the end of the book as usual. You probably can skip number ten and go trait to number 11 and not miss a thing.The sorry part is he know we'll just keep on buying his books because we want to see the end of it. RJ need to listen to the majority of his fans here. They are the one who made him."
1,Not a good book by itself,"I have read the other nine books and have enjoyed them very much. Sad to say, I did not enjoy this one. The plot moves very slowly and many of the subplots are still not resolved. People should wait for the next book before buying this one. This might be a good book if the series were read continuously. As it is, this is not a good read considering that we have waited two years for this."
1,"Drop this, read Martin.",This series is the equivalent of watching paint dry. I would also give books six through whatever minus five stars. Quit wasting time and money and read A Song of Ice and Fire.
1,Disappointed just does not cover it!,"I don't understand what has happened to a series that had as much promise as the Wheel of Time. Crossroads of Twilight was the same as the last four books, only worse. There was no plot movement. This series has become a real source of frustration because it has been stalled for the past five books. The author even made us doubt if the small advancement in Winter's Heart actually meant anything (referring to Rand and Nynaeve cleansing saidin). I would not advise any newcomers to start this series. Mr. Jordan does not appear to have an end in sight. He has taken all the excitement I felt in the first five books and crushed it to nothing."
1,TOR should be embarassed,"I pitty Robert Jordan. He honestly believes this was a publishable book. His editors at TOR should be fired, fired for not having the moxy to stand up to Jordan and say ""This book is nothing but a crappy re-write of book 9."" At one point I started counting how many pages of paper were wasted to write a simple sentence. Nothing, and I mean NOTHING new happens until the second to last page (hard cover edition). I heard an interview recently where Jordan said he didn't care about the criticism this book has recieved because he is writing the books for himself, well Mr. Jordan, do yourself a favor and hire a new editor because this was horrible! If this isn't some ploy to make even more money out of devoted fans than Mr. Jordan trully has lost his ability to write exciting stories."
1,"OH, THE PAIN! (Please End It!)","The only reason I have this book is for the sake of the series. I almost did not buy it. My wife joined a book club and I got it for a PENNY. I had to think about it. My wife asked me how cheap do I want it? I had to think about it. If you want to read this book, read the first few pages the last few pages and a couple in the middle. That will catch you up with the story. The first books were fine I do not know what happend to the rest. Let's put it this way I can not go below a 1 on the rating. I would put a 0 if I could."
1,Slow Slow Slow,"Don't buy this book. Wheel of Time used to be great, but now Robert Jordan's books move at an incredibly slow pace. Each page is filled with useless detail that no one really cares about.After the last book I promised I would never buy one of Robert Jordan's books again.What happened Robert Jordan? Please, get yourself an editor who can get rid of all the fluff in your recent books. Your a good writer...but you are a good writer in desperate need of an editor!"
2,Struggle to finish...,"I have jammed through all the previous books pretty quickly... always finding some free time to read, not wanting to put them down. Boy was this book different. It took a great deal of effort to read this one. The story has been slowing for a few books, and in this one the story seems to have totally stalled out. The plot hasn't really moved forward at all. Reading about Mat was still enjoyable, but even that bit lacked any real excitement. <yawn> The author is obviously writing for himself. Was there an editor at all on this book? I seriously think this book could be distilled down into a 50-100 page intro for the next book and little would be lost. This book has pretty much killed what interest I had left in the series. I'll probably check back in 10 years and see if it's done yet."
1,Not up to Par,This is only a transition book that kicks the can down the road and does very little to help the story. You can skip it and not miss a beat - only worth the read if you are a TOTAL Jordan Junkie.
1,No More Wheel of Time,I Have been waiting for years for this tenth book and am very disapointed in the author. It's been a long series and used to be fairly good but the author only had the main character appear only once in the entire book for one chapter. I believe this is called milking the reader for all the bucks he can get out of the series. I am very mad and would like the author to get on with the series or get off and quit. Finish it Mr. Jordon and don't milk me for more money. You used to be a decent author but you fooled the public.
1,Too bad I can't give it a zero.,"The essence of the book requires at most 10 pages. Otherwise, it's mostly looking at trees and changing dresses. Now would be an excellent time to utilize your local library."
1,The wheel spins and spins and goes nowhere.,"Plot within plot, whithin plot, whithin....The wheel of time just spins and spins, and goes absolutely nowhere.This series started out so great, but now it is a total waste of your time and money."
1,Slooooowwww. Please stop the pain!,"Needless to say, this book does not pick up where the other one left off..The Male Half of the one source is clean, but hardly even mentioned as a major event. Character development is at the C and D level, the main characters everyone is familiar with are not moved forward.I was really looking forward to this book after reading the last one (and all the previous ones). There are way too many characters now, and the good ones from the first three are hardly mentioned (e.g. Lan...)Bottom Line: This whole series is getting very long in the tooth, and needs to be ended before all of his readers end up dead of old age..."
1,Absolutely horrible,"People keep writing that this book is just a setup for the next in the series, and we shouldn't be so hard on it. Any serious author doesn't use an entire book as a mere prologue to the next book. That's a horrible way to write a series, and the main reason this series has gone down the drain. What could have been a great fantasy series has turned into pointless drivel. I could sum up this book completely in a page summary. It's come to that point where there is -zero- plot advancement, the redundancy has become unbearable, and Jordan's writing has gotten worse and worse. This series is dead.For a real fantasy series go pick up George R.R. Martin's 'Song of Ice and Fire' saga. Now that's a truely great fantasy story by an author who knows how to progress a series."
1,Is this the best that Jordan could come up with?,"Please do not waste your money buying this book. He does not deserve anything for this poor excuse for literature.Borrow it from a library and save your money to buy a book you will at least enjoy. If you must own it, wait till it comes out in paperback.I am very disapointed that this was the best he could come up with in nearly 2 years.I have little hope for the next book."
1,Jordan is killing me.,"This is the worst book out of the ten. Nothing happens, except that R. Jordan has made another million dollars. Those of us who loved the first 5 books, and suffered through the last four, are now crucified upon the tenth. Most of the interesting side plots are dropped in favor of new characters who overwhelm the reader by their staggering numbers and their seeming irrevelance to the storyline. I will probably buy the next book, because I am a glutton for punishment, and there is a tiny optimistic flame within me that says Mr. Jordan will return to form. Please come back to us, Mr. Jordan. Bring back the Wheel of Time that we once loved. We miss Rand and the rest of the Scoobie gang. Please, before it's too late, and we finally grow spines strong enough to resist your cover art."
1,As bad as it gets,"Oh my god,I started reading WOT when I started University. 15 Years later I read that a new book is coming out, and that the series might end soon.So I take all my old books, buy the ones I do not have and actually enjoy reading all of them.TILL NOW.Man that book is bad, and the characters are a Pain. I really started to hate Elayne in this book. I still have close to 300 pages, and if I had not already read some good reviews of KOD, I would put that series away for good.I am still trying to figure out, what part sucked most till now, but I guess, it is Elayne and all that stupid subplots about getting the throne of Andor."
3,Where is the other half...,"After finishing this book, I got the feeling that there should have been at least another half a book. It doesn't follow the normal plot line with in a greater plot line that has marked the rest of the series. (You know, a begining, a middle and an end with a climax somewhere) This book ends in the middle. I have to wonder if Jordon actually wrote a much longer book and Tor balked at the thought of publishing the whole thing and forced Jordon to split the book in half. I hope this is the case as the next book in the series will hopefully be released at a much quicker pace than this one was."
1,wheel of time grinds to a halt,"Apparently the wheel of time revolves at various speeds! In this volume, it finally grinds to a dead stop. Never were more words spent describing irrelevant and unremarkable aspects of scenery and clothing. Now that the wheel has stopped, perhaps the next volume will reveal it moving again ... in reverse. Ten volumes of flashbacks? Perhaps the same tales will be told from a different perspective, e.g., the view from the underside of all the fallen leaves, rocks, and snow he feels compelled to describe. I'll wait for volume 21, when things may begin to move *forward* again."
1,Much ado about nothing,"I noticed that the rating for customers is 1 and a half stars, that speaks volumes, which it seems to be Jordan's aim now. I have never been this dissapointed in a book before. Mat and Perrin are the only people who move in the whole book and it is only down the road a little bit, everyone else is in the same spot at the end. On the plus side it is well written but fluff only takes you so far. At the end of the book I was reminded of the scene in the Monty Python's the Holy Grail, when the large group of people yell, ""Get on with it!""."
2,please shoot me,"i have read all of the books in this series, and this one was beyond sub-par. granted, the author is trying to work towards the end of the series, and this book was key in moving plotlines along, but it still was a tease, and a bad one, considering the book was released 2 months after the originally projected release date. i would recommend that if you really want to read it, wait until it comes out in paperback, or borrow it from a friend."
2,Robert Jordan's Book 10,"Slooooooow is the best description I can give this book. Too many characters are added unto each succeeding books that it becomes difficult to keep up with who is doing what, especially since the time lapse between books is much too long. I don't believe Mr. Jordan knows how to end this story. I no longer enjoy reading it and wish he would ""nail shut this coffin"" while he still has readers who are intrested in finding out how this lengthy saga ends."
2,Are we there yet? Maybe in another 10 books...,"Unfortunately, it seems Robert Jordan has fallen into the commercial trap that so many pulp fantasy writers do: serial placeholders. The first three or four books in this series were excellent, with a sufficient mix of character development and plot action. Now, it seems that we have 600+ pages of rehashed character un-development with a few new novelty characters thrown in to make it look like something is happening. After finishing reading the book and looking back, there is NO significant plot advancement at all. You could skip this book altogether and pick up book 11 without even realizing it. I'm very disappointed in Robert Jordan, and even though I've been forcing myself to read The Wheel of Time since it came out, if Mr. Jordan is trying to drag this series out for another ten books, I'm sure I won't be the only reader who moves on to fresher material long since."
2,Very Disapointed,"Don't get me wrong the series is good but its getting a bit on the long side. The problem with this book is nothing actually happens! I'm serious a lot of people talk, a lot of people move around but nothing happens...Leave off purchasing this book until it is in paper back or even better dig it up at a second hand store ( i know thats where a lot of copies are going to end up! )I know you aren't going to believe me but in all the other books I can name something good or positive that happened, a forsaken that dies, a battle won but in this book I can't name anything exciting happening except a twist that was thrown in at the end ... but that was as subtle as a sledge hammer and I believe added in by the editors after they read this extremely boring book.All i can say is I hope he does better in the next book ... I have invested so much of my time and energy into this series I would really hate to see it fizzle out..."
2,Why bother?,"Jordan has either proven he lost track of the plot (though his interviews a while ago claimed he already had the ending written from early on) or he has truly succumbed to milking the market. Unfortunately, all he has done is sent me to the library. There is NO compelling reason to buy this book - it goes nowhere, does nothing and only served to destroy much of the joy the early books gave me.Seriously, the first eight books are worth owning, nine and ten are a loss. I suggest you wait for your local library to get a copy and check it out. If you have to wait several months to get the copy from the library, don't worry - the wait will seem quicker than this book reads."
3,"Great writer, but the book is more a prologue...","I enjoy greatly reading Jordan's books, but the book is unfinished.In fact, I could say it has more of prologue features: prepares a reader for further plot development and leaves him with more questions and no answers.Therefore, there are a lot disappointments: a reader, kept agitated with a super prologue, expects ""book"": with its own individuality, plot development and more answers; instead, gets a beginning, a prologue, for another, without any doubt, interesting writing.All in all, it is a very interesting piece of writing; however, cannot be considered as a separate book, but a beginning for one."
1,For shame RJ,"This has to be the worst book in the series. I am a devout wheel of time fan but even I can see that Robert Jordan is milking it. Yes thats right milking every penny he can out of the series.You will put this book down many times. Why ? Because its boring, there are no major conflicts in this book. The characters that he has been adding at the prologue of this and all his previous 2 books just dissapear.Please finish the series with a bang, dont let all your hard work be for naught. As the series stands now its chaos.Dissapointed Fan."
1,Dont bother.,Flash! Tor Books announces that Robert Jordan's Great grandson will complete the epic Wheel of Time series... Grandson predicts at least another 8 to 10 books bringing the total to 38 or 40....Come on Mr. Jordan wrap it up already! If you left out just the women's clothing descriptions you would have at least one less book.Number 10 is just filler. The plot again goes nowhere sloowwly.The 1 star is for the cover art. People dont waste your time or your money. Even for die hards like me (yes I own and have read & reread all of them)it is getting to be very boring.
2,Worst book of the series...,Jordan has so many side plots going that it looks like he had to make this book entirely about developing them... Rand appears for less than 20 pages... No forsaken catch the ax... No real battles... I'm hoping this book is setting the stage for some real action in the next book... But I'm pretty disappointed about waiting two years for this... If this pace keeps up we will need another 10 books to finish the series...Heres to another two year wait...
1,What the F***,"This book is horrible. The dialogue is like something like this(think Bill And TEd)Perrin and Aram discussing the Shiado)P: Dude lets go kill some Shiado!A: Dude lets go! Uh, dude, who are the Shiado?P: Dude their the Aiel clan lead by that HOTTIE Sanahanna or what ever that chicks name is.A:Dude,she is a righteos babe! Dude, Uh, why do we want to kill a hottie like her? This review is not suppose to help youP: Dude they kidnapped Faile, my backstreetbi****!A:Dude, that was was so wrong of them, Dude!P: Yeah, Dude, Dude!A:Dude, lets go kick their poser butts dude!P: Yeah, dude, lets go! Uh, Dude whose butts are we going to kick,Uh, Dude.The entire book was as stupid and pointless as the above story! Please RJ make something happen in book 11 or Dude I just might stop reading this series ( I can't even spell right because I am so mad)"
1,Wow.,"Robert Jordon does what he does best: Milking the hell out of the WoT series. 600+ reviews and 2 stars. Even his die-hard fans are starting to have doubts. Someone in his editorial department or his publisher need to tap him on the shoulder and say ""Hey, it's okay. Just end you. There's rehabs. Or you can always write ""Wheel of Space"". Same characters except in space. But please just finish the book""Plot summary: Nothing remotely interesting happens. Unless you like to know what type of clothes Elayne likes to wear. Rand (you know, the main character) is missing from the majority of the book. Take everything that's been written about all the main character from the previous book, cut and paste it to this one, and there you go. This is easily the worst WoT book."
2,What I think!,"This book needs to be put on the back shelf! It may sell, but only on the merits of the series. Did Jordan forget the standard format of a hero's journey? He forgot the most important part; the climax! Wheres the battle, the downed enemy, or the discorved hazard? Left out? LEFT OUT! How can a GOOD book end with out some milestone?So if you've been reading the series wait till it comes out in paperback then buy it.. read it.. throw it away! If you haven't been reading the series DON'T START!! Wait until its done then skip this novel when you do read it.Finaly to mister Jordan, FINISH the series!Thanks,Jim"
3,Hard to Follow,"So many characters to keep up with, plot keeps expanding. Losing track of storyline as it was in beginning books. He's still worth reading. I will continue to buy and read Jordan, as soon as he publishes. It's taking too long to move in the story. Rand, as one of the main characters, comes in almost at the end of the book."
3,SET UP,"I have read about 1/2 of the book and it appears to be another ""set up"" book. It is laying the foundation for the concluding books (I have read there will maybe 3 more) of the Wheel of Time. This is a must for all WOT readers but not the best, not even the second or third best."
3,"good, but not great","the book was good, but not very advancing in the series. if you have stuck with the series for this long, dont stop now. i liked it alright, but the book jackets for the 9th and 10th books almost sound the same."
3,Soap Opera like,"I enjoyed the earlier books in this series much more than the later books. The plot in the series progresses at soap opera speeds. All of Robert Jordon's books in this series need to edited into smaller faster passed books. Each character is cursed with leading an interesting life which is followed on a day to day basis. Most of the characters no longer interest me, but I still want to find out what happens."
1,Nothing happened?,"I wouldnt say that nothing happened, since after i read this book, an end to this series is very unlikely in my eyes. there wasnt any action at all and the story wasnt brought forward, but Jordan introduced some new problems and characters. This really got me frustrated, and i feel like a junkie, who doesnt get the thrill anymore, but cant let go of his addiction.Please Mr. Jordan: release us!!"
1,Wait for the paperback.,"Not One Battle scene in the entire book.No major decisions or events.In fact, the entire thing was like reading deleted scenes from the last book. Scenes that could have been left deleted. Perrin chases his own tail, Matt courts his future wife, Egwene watches the rebels chase their tails, Rand makes a cameo appearance and the bad guys are either all on vacation or doing equally boring things of their own. Definitely NOT worth the price of buying in hardback. Very disapointing."
3,Nothing is resolved,"I had the same criticism of book 10 that I had of book 8 - nothing major happens. All the plot lines progress a little bit, but just when you think something major could happen, the novel ends. And it doesn't even seem like a good stopping point, it just ENDS. I've read somewhere that this is part of Jordan's plan, to make every other book a more intense book, which I can believe because book 9 was great.You might want to even put off reading book 10 until book 11 is due to come out, otherwise you'll end up like many of us, disappointed at the end of 10 and frustrated that you have to wait another 2 years for anything to happen."
1,went know where.,just wanted to say it isn't worth the wait nothing change but more ?????? then answear should of gave us something.
4,More Please,"This book nudges the complex plot of ""The Wheel of Time"" forward with no end in sight. The series is compelling and this book is a must read for those of us who have read the previous novels. Those unfamiliar with the series should start at the beginning with ""The eye of the World"""
3,More of the same but...,"I have to agree with one of the fellow reviewers. I dont want to sound repetitive but eventhough this book is more of the same since Path of Daggers it is not as terrible as I thought it was going to be reading previous reviews. It is dull, many useless descriptions and a boring Prologue but... If you read between lines there are several clues that definetly show a glimpse finally on Tarmon Gaidon and a future conclusion. I kinda find it like the sequel to Lord of the Rings, the Two Towers, 900 pages /3 hours of movie about..nothing, but transitions are necessary for the conclusion. I do think, true that Mr Jordan has probably been seduced by the tainted power of marketing, sales and capitalism, ""as long as there is profit, may the series extend!""... well we eagerly await a conclusion, no matter how many books left1, 3 5... as long as they are grasping and interesting!!!!!"
3,wheel of Time book 9a,"I was very disappointed with this book, in comparison with the rest of the series, which was excellently written. instead of anything meaningful happening, almost the whole of the book is devoted to other characters being aware of the events at the end of Winter's Heart. aside from this, they seem to do not much but sit around and talk. while thsi could have been done well, they don't really seem to have much to talk about. I enjoy character interaction, but i like it to have some purpose.It would have been nice to have a little more action as well.As a result of this total lack of plot advancement, and its coexistance with the events ending book 9, i would rather call this Book 9A than book 10.and for the love of God, could someone please find a better person to do the cover art for these books? These look like teddy bears, not people. maybe one of the D&D artists is available."
1,Same Old Same Old,"Ho, hum...yet another Wheel of Time book in which nothing happens. I can't believe I wasted money on this book, let alone slogged all the way through it. Jordan is a workmanlike writer at best and is completely uninspired here, except by the large dollar signs this series continues to bring in based on its promising but now squandered beginnings seven books ago. Will this series ever end? Don't hold your breath as long as Jordan and TOR still make money from it. I wouldn't be surprised to see the 4 or so major characters split off into book series of their own in order to keep this tedious material going as long as people will pay for it."
1,Read First 8 Books Twice -- Sorry I Read This One Once,"Unbelievably bad, boring and frustrating. Jordon is now writing just to make a buck. What an insult to his loyal readers. I'm debating whether to even buy the paperback of the next installment. If it stinks as bad as this one I'm done with the series. Jordon should be ashamed of himself because he can't seriously believe his loyal readers would like this obvious stink bomb. The only explanation is that he is dragging out the story with unnecessary and excruciatingly boring details such as the color of mud on some peasant's boots just so he can sell a few more books. The book is a miserable disappointment. Given six weeks any hack could have written it. Watching ice melt would have been more interesting, and a lot cheaper. If you must read it, borrow it from the library."
1,Will this ever end????,"I have lost all respect for Robert Jordan with this beast of a book. It is as ponderous and slow moving as an entire Army of Trollocs. What happened to the characters in the 1st 3 Books? There are so many sub-plots and new characters that I no longer care, nor know what happened to Rand.Jordan has done nothing other than to drag out a series that could have ended in 4-5 books of this length. How much more money do you need to make before enough is enough Mr. Jordan? I will buy no more. I fell for the trap after book 5 but will not do so again.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR GEORGE R.R. MARTIN'S OR TERRY GOODKIND'S NEW BOOKS."
1,Huge disappointment,"I was greatly disappointed by this book. You could probably cut this book out between books 9 and the future book 11 and not really miss anything. I found it hard to keep track of all the minor incidental characters introduced at the beginning of the book and I was annoyed that the writer didn't get to any of the main characters until about 80 pages into the book. It is too long between books to remember the myriad of little characters that he spends so much time on. I lost track of the various generic Aes Sedai running around in the different cities. I feel like I need to reread the whole series each time a new book comes out just so I can remember who is who.What happened to all the great monsters he created in earlier books? What happened to all the action of the previous books? . I've loved the series up until this book and will buy future books, but I found this book to be awful, and a waste of my time."
1,Bad,What more is there to say? Read the other reviews. I agree 100% with all of them. Storytelling at it's worst.
3,Very Slow Moving,"I was disappointed in this book. I agree with some of the other reviews that it is indeed setting up the chess pieces and trying to put everything in the right place for what is to come, but I was hoping for more content than what came out of this segment of the story. I enjoy what is going on with Matt and Tuon and I also like the story of Faile. I would have been satisfied with a shorter book that left out some of the side stories rather than the rambling tone that this book seemed to have."
1,A sad tale,"Like most fans, I thought that books 1-4 were great. Perhaps even rivaling the great George R.R. Martin for fantasy written in the last couple of decades.Jordan, quite simply, has run out of ideas and needs to drag this series out as long as possible in order to ""earn"" a living.If you are reading this and have not started with Jordan. Read 1-6 and stop. 7-10 are painful, unenjoyable books.Personally, I tossed my collection and will not purchase him again."
1,Boring,"Had to force my self to finish, Worst book I have ever read. I just hope the next book is'nt this bad. I myself camt beleave I finished it. All in all it could have been cut down to mabey 50 pages and all that is needed to be would have been explaned."
1,Yawn...............,"snoozed..snooze...snooze...(wakes up) Oh, im sorry this book is so dumb and boring i fell asleep"
1,Surely this one will be better right?,"WRONG. As many others have already posted, I found myself skimming through pages of useless detail. You suffer whole chapters of the typical aes sedai tea parties. You know the ones that start out with people pulling their shawls and back biting everyone else, well get ready you suffer several of these.Jordan knows that his books are not anywhere near as good as they used to be, but he doesnt care. He and his publisher seemed to have come to the conclusion that charging you $... for 500 pages of fluff and 100 pages of actual plot, is great business.I told myself that this time, surely the pace and the plot will move forward. No dice people. I will not buy another. There are other writers out there who actually write a compelling story."
1,Suckling at the greed cow,"Save your money. Jordan is obviously milking this as much as he can. The plot line does not progress and everything is floating is useless wording and excessive descriptions. I cannot believe that his editor let him get away with half of the content. This book is not worth the heat it would throw off in your fireplace. You could go straight to book 11 without missing anything...although, I doubt that would be much better. Jordan should be ashamed."
1,Its not worth 1 star,"I told myself after Winter's Heart I would stop reading thisseries.Why didn't I listen to myself!!!The first books in the series were sooo good, I keep thinking Robert Jordan will go back to the way he use to write.But now I know he's looking to drag this out to book 100. Some part of me is starting to think Robert Jordan is no longer writing these books,that maybe he sold it to some newbie writer off the street.I don't know, and I don't care anymore.Well, let my mistake be your good fortune. Save your money.If you are looking for a great fantasy book, type in a searchfor George R.R. Martin. His books could be called too good."
1,Book 11 Should be given FREE to all who bought Book 10!!!,"I imagine Robert Jordan laughing his heart out on his way to the bank. Simply because we are all suckers to his wheel of time series! What kind of rip-off is this? You plow through 680 pages and none of the ongoing plots gets resolved? Book 11 should be given out free to all Book 10 buyers. Robert Jordan owes it to his fans. This book makes me question his love for the fantasy genre and his respect for his fans. Yes to those who haven't bought the book, wait till they hit bargain prices before you get a copy."
2,I have to agree...,"I have been the most ardent of fans and unlike most Shadow Rising adherents I feel that the Lord of Chaos is the pinnacle of the series. This book however, like the last two, is an extremely boring disappointment. There is no direction and it is obvious Jordan has lost control of the story. So many characters have simply disappeared that I have lost count; not to mention the fact that the prologue seems to be a prologue for book eleven more than book ten. The one redeeming part of the book was Mats story which of course was without any kind of character or plot arc, but at least he is entertaining. There are so many questions about who is where and what I am actually angry at this book. I am of course going to keep buying the books though. ..."
1,The Crossroads of Twilight,"This book is the literary equivalent of watching paint dry. It's obvious now that Jordan is being paid by the quantity of words and not the quality. He wrote 600+ pages that could have easily been reduced to 50. There were times when several pages would go by and no dialogue takes place. Instead, you have to wade through endless descriptions of how gray the sky was or what clothes someone was wearing. Then of course you're reintroduced to countless minor characters that you can't remember anything about because it's been 2 years since the last book. To top things off, the book covers only a couple of weeks in the lives of the characters and NOTHING HAPPENS!"
1,The story is not fun to read anymore,The earlier books were fun to read. This series and especially this title has made the series a chore. I skimmed the last half of the book hoping it would pick up and the story would begin to move forward.It never did.I have purchased all 10 of the author's novels in this series. I won't purchase the 11th.
3,catharsis below,"'cause that's what this review is for me...i cannot believe the lack of ""happening"" in this novel. It seems like Jordan cannot exceed the pace of the series. If anything he slows down. At least the prior novels, while slow, had plot twists, ect. This book should have been double in length(yes i know it's long) so at least SOMETHING would happen. Where is the content????!!! I do not need battles every page, but why can't Jordan wrap up a thread or two? This series will never and I do mean never finish in two or three books without completely glossing over or dropping entire plot elements. At this point that wouldn't be so bad if we could just get a book dedicated to the main characters: Rand, Mat, Elayne, Aviendha, ect. There were enjoyable periods to Crossroads but mainly it felt like Jordan used a ""large"" font simply to create a long novel. I will buy the next novel but that may be the end for me.Thanks for listening."
1,600 pages of nothing!,"Books 1 through 7 take the reader on a fast a glorius journey through many lands, many battles and intertwined plots. All were extremely enjoyable reading. Books 8 and 9 slow the pace down, but they are still very worth while. Book 10 should never have been published, it has no plot and no pace. Hopefully Jordan will take an opportunity to read these reviews and re-energize Book 11. If not, I am thru reading them. There are too many other good fantasy writers out there to waste time on reading a boring book like this!"
1,"Fantasy mimics reality, unfortunately","The Wheel of Time series started with such promise but has become hopelessly mired in political manuvering, sort of like the United Nations.The removal of one of the greatest stumbling blocks to our heroes, the taint on Saidin (the male half of magic) has caused a complete stop in the progress of the story.It appears that Robert Jordan relied so heavily on the problems assosiated with men using The One Power that removal of that obstacle has left the plot in the luch. Sort of like having the worlds most powerful military force but being to afraid to use it for fear of the political backlash.The good guys have the weapon they need, time to let them use it!"
2,Absolutely BORING,"The reason I became hooked on this series was because of the great characters (Rand, Mat, and Perrin) the complex plot twists, great writing, and the epic battles against evil. All, save great writing, have been absent from this book. I am tired of hearing about Aes Sedai and their petty differences. Get on to the siege of Tar Valon. There was no need to get so in depth and detailed with this aspect of the story. I, along with most readers would rather hear about how Rand is after his cleansing of Saidin, how Mat is doing, or Perrin's trek to rescue his wife. You can only take so much of Aes Sedai whining."
1,What a change!,"My biggest problem is how much the quality has changed since the start of this series. Remember reading the first 5 or 6 books till all hours of the night and going in to work the next day bleary eyed? Then go home and read far later than was wise yet again? I used to hope that the series would go on for 20 books, but instead it died after 6. The WoT and book 10 have devolved into mediocrity. When held against the standard of the start of the series, it has devolved into nothing but a waist of my time.This book is the twitching corpse of a once great series."
1,Same Old Formula- Same Old Disappointment,"This is yet another disappointing installment of the once-magnificent Wheel of Time Series. Like many, I was completely enthralled by the early books of this series, however the author and publisher seem to be more interested in prolonging the series (and I assume their cash flow) than completing a great work of art. COT, like its immediate predecessors, is a maddening jumble of fragmented plot lines that fail to move the master story ahead in any significant manner. Tor, like the author, has forgotten what made the earlier works in the series great- that each book was a self contained story that had a beginning, middle, and end; but somehow still supported the over riding plot line.At this point, the story may be unsalvagable as is the support of many fans."
2,Start at page 500,"Absolutely nothing happens in the first 500 pages. Total tedium. The last third of the book still doesn't have much going on, but at least some events occur."
1,I Did Not Get Suckered This Time,"I am proud to say that I did not get suckered into buying this book. I have gotten suckered into buying all of the rest of the series, but with the last couple of books I could see that Jordan really no longer cares about making a good story, but rather milking this financial situation for all it is worth. I won't be party to that, though he is smart enough to know that many of you will be."
1,Skip this book!,"This is by far the worst of the series. When the series is over and I re-read it start to finish, I'm skipping this volume."
1,Hah! I figgered(sic) it out!,"OK, so nothing happens. You can't even call it ""going in circles"", because circles are too big, unless you're talking about a spinning pirouette that truly goes nowhere. But pay attention to the clues; circular reasoning, overwhelmingly female point of view, the authors massive hat and fake beard.... ROBERT JORDAN IS A WOMAN!!! ""He"" is a psuedonym. ""He"" would not be the first female author to pose as a male. I'm not saying this is the cause of this series downfall, it's just something I figured out.Roberta has been outed."
5,I Don't Get It,"It's hard for me to imagine why this book had such a poor review. I find it is just as good as all the others, although different in a few ways. True, there was perhaps less action than one may have expected, but doesn't that give you the impression that everything is starting to boil together and patterns are being created, all leading to the last battle? Doesn't it make you feel the tensions rising, the plots develloping and chaos approaching? I would like to congratulate Robert Jordan for this fantastic book, and can't wait for the next release."
3,Eh so so,"This book is rather so so, with a ton of dialogue and a lot of hair tugging. However, despite this the writing is decent. AND IT IS BETTER THAN TWILIGHT WHICH IS THE WORST BOOK EVER WRITTEN. This is the low point in the series, but from here it can only get better. ALWAYS LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE OF DEATH (see if you get what im saying) (Im sorry Mr. Jordan's spirit for that) (NOW I FEEL AWFUL) (PLEASE FORGIVE ME) (IVE GONE MAD BWAHSAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA >:0"
2,Slow Train to Nowhere,"I think the other reviews say it all. This books is a break from Jordans normal writing style. In most of the previous WOT books Jordan would touch on all of his plot lines but concentrate on advancing two story lines. In this book he trys to spend too much time on everything and you end up going nowhere. Not only does he not close off any story lines, but he opens up several new ones. The end result is you only get half a book here. There are alot of interesting things that happen, but I suggest waiting for the next book and then buying both at once. In fact if Jordan wants to salvage most of his readers after this debacle he will need to release a followup book to this in a hurry. If we have to wait another two years or more I can see alot of fans not comming back."
1,Skip this one,"This series started out as one of the best of all time, and now it's sunk to this. 690 pages of garbage. Save your [money] and wait for the next one - you won't miss a thing if you don't buy this volume. Mr. Jordan seems to have forgotten that the point of a book is to tell a story, not wast paper."
1,"Nothing Happens,...again!!!","If you loved book eight(which I most certainly didn't) you'll like this one two because it's the same:nothing happens. If you can't wait to borrow the book, just read the publishers spiel about it and you'll know everything that happens. And if you need it for your collection a one page summary slipped in between books 9 and 11(assuming that one will be worth reading)should suffice."
1,"Horrible, useless exposition!!","I am absoultely appalled! How did one of my favorite series deteriorate into a play by play account of ordinary, mundane activities? Nothing was accomplished in this book, that is, nothing that couldn't have been covered in three or four chapters, leaving the extra 500 pages for a real book. The painfully slow pacing of this installment has me seriously considering whether I should even bother picking up the next one, and I am truly disturbed by the prospect of seeing this cherished series continue to degrade. It would be better to leave it unfinished then continue on in this manner.I'm sure it's obvious, but I advise you not to purchase this book. Get an unlucky friend to summarize it for you. Or go to one of the many fan sites on the web and read a summary of this book, but do it quickly, because this book has the potential to drive off all but the most fanatical ""Wheel of Time"" fans."
1,Don't Bother,"I own all of the WoT, the last several in hardback. I've read all of them twice or more. I've had CoT on pre-order with Amazon for about a year. Suffice it to say that I'm a fan of the series. However, after reading this one, I'm thinking about just quitting. How an author could do so little in 680 pages absolutely boggles the mind. Glacial would be a compliment. I mean, this is ridiculous.I have no problem with Jordan spending a fair amount of time setting the stage for big events to come. However, he could have easily compressed everything in this book into a prologue or 2-3 chapters. Why bother reading it?I really thought RJ was going somewhere with this series. I thought it might end in 12-13 books, as he's been claiming for awhile. ... Give me a break."
1,Waste of time!!,"It's hard to imagine someone could write so many words and say virtually nothing. I really don't understand why Jordan even bothered with writing this one. Everything pertinent that happens in this book could have been compressed into a few chapters. Several books in the series have been slow, but this one is beyond comprehension. Save your money! and a few trees!"
2,Save your money and your time,"I'll keep this brief, as opposed to the ponderous tome in review. You could completely skip this book and not miss anything. I give the book 2 stars only out of respect for the first 7 books that I felt were worth the time and money. Unfortunately I now, along with the rest of you, must wait who knows how long for the 11th book to be produced. Until then, I eagerly await George R R Martin's fourth book in the ""Song of Fire and Ice"" series."
1,When will it end?,"I am admittedly a fantasy-aholic and will even confess to having read most of Patricia McKillip's books more than once...Riddlemaster 4 times at last count. The chance to while away a long, cold winter with a truly long fantasy saga excited me to the point of purchasing the first eleven Wheel of Time books. By volume 6, I truly found myself hoping that a bomb would fall on and obliterate every lead character. Not that we should come to love each fantasy lead character, in fact, some I love to hate, but I remain absolutely indifferent to Jordan's characters, as I've grown indifferent to the whole Wheel of Time thrust."
1,"Mr. Robert Jordan, please read:","Mr. Jordan:The entire book could have been written in 20-25 pages.Stop it with the drama and cut to the chase. We (and there are a lot of us) are fed up with reading page after page of meaningless dialog and self thought. This is just another 700 pages of actionless nonsense. We have read each of the other nine books, and we after going this far, we will probably read another. So please, please, please end the torture have the charachters do something - anything.Myself and other readers look forward to your next book - - - but fool us again, and we will wait to buy #12 from the remainder bin."
1,Scott,Don't bother with this book. It seems that the author has sold out good story telling and moving the story along so he could print an additional book and make more money. If you do buy it good luck trying to stay awake.
3,"Filler, but not a complete turd","I can't say as I enjoyed the 10th book so much as it has made me excited about the 11th. Not a lot happens, but a lot is foreshadowed. It is this that drew me to Jordan in the first place. Sure, I'm all for the hero hacking the baddies to bits for the sake of his true love, but I find it much more fulfilling to read a story where I am engaged in the plotline and invited to bring my own sense of right and wrong to bear on the situations described. Jordan's work is engaging if not always exciting."
1,Why?,Must add my voice to the general feeling of disappointment around this series. Have been reading for 15 years or something like that. The last 5 have had little if any plot progress. Read George R.R. Martin instead.
1,Oy! Robert! Lets get a move on,"Ok. I bought it. I read it. I wish I hadn't.Will the real Robert Jordan please stand up?Have you ever bought a really cool product only to find that the only way to get the really good stuff to work is to buy 15 other add-ons? I really feel that way with the WoT series.This book feels just like what it is: a giant hook for the next few books. If you have read the first 9 installments then you should read this one just to keep yourself up to date. If you are thinking of getting into this series for the first time, read the first 4 books then wait for the final one to come out.Robert, please don't make us wait 3 years for 600+ pages of treading water."
1,saidin was cleansed but the book is not,"What little happens is contained in the last last 50 pages of the book. I really wanted Jordan to do well and save a series on life support. The first books were so well written, it is a shame that it has degraded to this.You are better off rereading one of his earlier books in the series as absolutely nothing happens, except Egwene doing something completely stupid."
1,Nothing,"That's what happened in this book. Absolutely nothing. No one really went anywhere, no one did anything. It contributed nothing to the series. You could not read this book and you would miss, well, nothing. I think Jordan has lost track of where he wanted the story to go. He has no clue how to end it. Either that or he's become enamoured of his own prose (and the big checks.) I'm not looking forward to the next book and I probably won't read it. The Wheel of Time series has become ridiculous. End it already! Here I'll end it for you. Rand goes nuts, breaks the world and kills everybody. How tough was that. Yeesh. (By the way, I think Jordan's biggest fan may be Terry Goddkind. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.)"
1,Painful and Sad,"I will not delve into the poor plot development, slow pace and repetitive dialouge. Many others on this list have done so already. However, like most I feel I have to warn away anyone who is considering the arduous trek of winding through this tale. As many have said the first 5 books are quite compelling, but like a fly trap they draw you in and hold you while you suffer through the next 5 books. At this point I am through, Mr. Jordan you have beaten me. I know longer have any interest in knowing what happens to your characters, even though at one time I would have stood in line to buy the next installment the day it came out. It is now simply a sad, painful day when I see one of your books hit the shelf."
1,"Please Mr. Jordan, pick up the pace","Well, I am one of the suckers who cannot stop reading these books. I expect that I will continue to read them as long as they keep coming out, with the ever-fading hope that the series will someday end, and end well.Unfortunately, if the current pace continues, it will never end. In Book 10, nothing happened to further the plot. Perrin did nothing. Mat did nothing. Rand did nothing. The Forsaken did nothing. The Aes Sedai did nothing. Elayne did nothing. This book did nothing.But incredibly, I still have hope. Maybe Mr. Jordan will read all these negative reviews and try to pick up the pace in the next book. Maybe he will write an outline beforehand so he can plan what happens in the plot. This way he can make sure that something productive happens in the book.Although I was sorely disappointed with Book 10, I will continue to take read his books (from the library) as long as he writes them."
1,WHY WASTE YOUR GREAT FANS TIME AND MONEY,"I just finished your tenth book in the wheel of time and I can""t tell you how dissapointed I am! To waste that many pages of good trees, when you could have done the same in just over 100 pages is beyond any of your readers minds. This series started out so great and so many of your books carried on this greatness, but your last 3 or 4 have just not done your readers justice. Why wait to finish this series? You add so many unneeded and terribly boring facts, are you just trying to sell books?We all know what is going on why postpone the climax. Please just let Rand,Mat, Perrin, and the rest just get to the last battle. Then if you feel it is needed start a new series!Please do not dissapoint us AGAIN.Thank You, Barry PetersP.S. Tolkien would never do this."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzz,"After wading through the first nine books in this series, I'm wondering why I bothered to read the tenth. I thought for certain that this would end the series but to my dismay, I find that Rand, et al were still firmly emeshed in what now seems to be an endless soap opera. I've read about all I can stand about the ""ageless"" Aes Sedi, what all the women are wearing, Rand's apparently incurable pain and suffering, and an entire host of other repetitive and boring self-serving details which I could do without. Despite my aversion to leaving a tale unfinished, I don't think I'll be reading Jordan's 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, etc., etc., etc. offerings. Too I take fervent exception to the New York Times' claim that, ""Robert Jordan has come to dominate the world Tolkien began to reveal."" Nonsense. Mr. Jordan's epic cannot even begin to measure up to the genius of Tolkien's work, except perhaps in the respect of how much room it takes up on the bookshelf."
4,Not the best but it was never meant to be a seperate book,Books one throuh nine in my opinion all deserve 5 stars. The first time reading this series through i was upset that the later books 5-9 diddnt have the fast pace that i came to enjoy from the first 4. That being said A year later i re read the series and actually found that the later books in the series are amazing. Just because there arnt epic battles every chapter or the one power being used to kill things doesnt mean that this story isnt progressing. The fact is the smarter you are the more you catch the plot twists and foreshadowing used by R.J. Furthermore if anyone actually is a fan of the series they would know that crossroads of twilight was never intended to be seperate from Winters Heart. R.J. himself says that He had to split it up because Winters Heart would simply be to big to produce. Doesnt it make since that all of book 10 heappens at the same time as book 9 jsut with different characters.
5,A Helluva Story,"The first time I read the Eye of the World Series I echoed the sentiments of a lot of the other posters who have chimed in on this series. After book 5 I felt there was a drop off in the quality and direction of the story. I was even disappointed with books 8,9, and 10. But recently I decided to reread the entire series and I found out that if read straight through this is a Helluva story. I mean the writing is truly incredible. Because of the scope of the story I found that the wait between books was a definite cause of my discontent. There was simply too much to remember after waiting a year or two for the next book in the series.I beleive that for those who truly appreciated the first 4 to 6 books but felt Jordan was loosing his touch after that, try reading the entire series. Read all 10 books as one continuous story and do not pay attention to each individual volume. I beleive you'll come away with a new appreciation for what Jordan has created."
1,A labor of love...,"The only reason I still read this series is out of reverence for the greatness of the first three books in the series.It is quite simply a labor of love to read them. I don't enjoy doing it, but I feel like I owe it to the characters to check up on them.Well this 10th book has erased that feeling. The characters I loved are dead. RJ killed them. He smothered them in banal descriptions, trite quasi-emotions and hackneyed repetitive dialogue.I am no longer interested in what happens to them. Good books are about who feels the pain. Those are the characters that grab a reader. The character that is MOST effected by events...that most hurts is usually the most compelling.Which is why the best part of CoT was reading the reviews. That is where the hurt is. The people feeling the pain are the readers--not the characters."
1,Fool for paying for this book.,"Now that I have read the book and have been utterly disappointed, I now wish I should have just waited and borrowed the book from the bloody library.I was a very die hard Jordan fan, but now I just feel that Jordan is squeezing as much money as he can from us with this series!All you die hard Jordan fans will disagree, but imagine waiting every two years since the beginning and end up reading this bloody balony of a book!Half of this book happened before the end of Winter's Heart! What's that about? He should have included that in that book instead!And about the great endings of the WOT books. What ending! There was no great ending!Cmon Jordan! Get your act together! Stop listening to your publishers to drag the book on to reap in the profits! pfffft!*thumbs down ten times over for this book*"
1,haven't even finished it,"This may sound like everyone else's review of this book, but I grew bored and lost about 60 pages into it. The darn index needs to be bigger so I can actually remember who these characters are and where they are going or why they are doing what they are doing. How many new plot lines can the man throw into a book and still keep loyal readers interested? Do we really need new major characters in this series? Please, for the love of Pete, wrap it up already! I bore with the series because of the strong beginning and middle volumes, but the latest are like reading soap opera transcripts."
1,Waste of time and money,"If there was a way to give this book less than one star, I would have done it. I used to be a big fan of the Wheel of Time series, having begun reading it well over a decade ago. Now, countless pages later, I feel VERY let down. I firmly believe that RJ is just milking this for all it's worth...and right now, it isn't worth much. The quality started to slip with book 8, got worse with book 9, and now this!The plot is asinine, the characters are becoming less and less interesting to read about; basically the entire story feels like it has ground to a halt. And supposedly this is going to wrap up in two more books? I can only hope that they'll be better than Crossroads of Twilight was! Mind you, I don't think that they could be any worse...If I had to sum up this book in one word it would be: BORING!"
1,How long can you beat a dead horse? This series is dead...,"I think that I will finally give up reading this series. The plot has started to move like a herd of stampeding turtles running in molasses.I was totally disappointed with this book, it did nothing for me but fill my spare time with wasted time. I will always enjoy reading books 1 through 5 but this is getting out of hand. It just drags and drags and drags, getting no where. I would suggest waiting for the Cliff Notes for this one."
1,Don't bother reading this book,"I thought the series would get better. I was wrong! Why doesn't Jordan just finish the series? When I was younger I used to love his books, but now they are not even worth buying."
1,None,I just started the book and hate it already. The best part about this book is reading the reviews others have left. Hilarious well written and free unlike this book. I feel as though I am in a dysfunctional relationship I can not get away from because I have been in it for so long. So in case you are wondering I will read the rest of the series and hate myself for doing it.
1,rotten Robert,"What in He$#fire is this!!!??I though Robert J. was an excellent writer with a great imagination, I did anyway, until I read the 10th book.This book is a failure, 1-9 were amazing, and they actually had some good fight and battle scenes, but #10 is just a lot of describing womens clothes, and almost all of it is detailing Elayne trying to gain the lion throne, which is not what anyone wants. We want Rand and Mat, and maybe Perrin.The only parts worth reading are the characters who can channel feeling the blazing beacon, the effects from Rand attempting to cleanse the taint from saidin, and how they all react to it.This book really just somehow sucks, after 9 amazing, fast-paced ones. I hope this book was just a set-up for the finale or the 11th book or something."
1,Just shoot me now. . .,"Robert Jordan has accomplished something no other writer has ever done before - turned me off of a series before I finished it. It no longer matters to me if there are 2 more books, 5 more, or 100 more. I have kicked the habit!A phone book has fewer characters to keep straight and a more interesting plot."
1,What a waste,"OK, we get it. The women are annoyed by the men and the men are annoyed by the women. And everyone wears fancy or drab clothing and drinks tea or wine, the details of which I really don't care about. And nobody trusts anyone else. And there are misunderstandings between different cultures.But nothing happens. And it happens in excruciating detail."
1,Put this Beast out of it&#65533;s misery!,"I'm going to have to jump on the bandwagon here. This series started out with all of the fire and power of a young warhorse, now it's just a tired old nag limping it's way toward the glue factory.Mr Jordan, if you have any respect for your characters, your fans or yourself, please, Please, PLEASE! Let this tired beast die!I've defended the author to other readers through the last 3 books... I thought I could hang in there 'til the end... I was wrong. George R.R.Martin... Here I come."
1,More filler than a ballpark frank,"Thank God I didn't buy this one. I wish I could say the same for the last NINE! Well, okay, the last FOUR! I wouldn't have stuck around this long if the first few installments hadn't been top-knotch sci-fi.Jordan has reduced himself to a drooling dotard, searching for some way out of this colossal mess of a plot. He has sold his sci-fi writing soul to Tor, but has lost his fans in the process.There is nothing in this book. Nothing. Crap. Crap. Crap.Goodbye, Mr. Jordan. I no longer care how you end this story. It ended, for me, four books ago.Oh, and wipe the drool off your chin. Moron."
1,One small step for a series,"I've read it, and if you're reading this review, you haven't. We're both in the same place, because nothing happened. Not one main or even peripheral plot line went anywhere in this book.Since this series has stretched on for a number of years, I've had to periodically start over again from the begining to keep it fresh in my head, and the last time I did so i kept notes of major developments and events. I noticed that my bullet points became fewer and fewer over the last couple books, until I only had 2-3 for Book 9, and for Book 10: nothing.Not one single solitary thing of any significance happened in this book, except for the fact that I don't have my money anymore.Time for a boycott - WAIT before you buy. Read the reviews of Book 11 (customer/fan reviews on Amazon, not media whores) and if it's the same as this, don't buy it. He can't hold out on us forever, and will have to give us an ending - ANY ENDING - to this series that once was so promising."
2,getting bit stale,"Like most of the other reviewers, I have been a wheel of time fan. However, I think Jordan has dragged the story out too long. After book 6, most of the narrative seems to be marking time. Details yes, but an epic should still have a goal. To me, book 7-10 is like reading someone's diary.I will probably get book 11 when it comes out. But it is likely be the last one I get."
1,Please no more,"After being hooked by the first 5 or so books, I have read the rest up to ""Crossroads of Twilight"" waiting for something to happen, I can't take any more of this. Yet anther WOT of time reader bored silly, never to return."
1,I feel violated after spending the $$ for this garbage,"After reading this plodding, tedious, annoying, and totally unnecessary book, I have come to the conclusion that I will never read another book by Robert Jordan.The Dark One might win and turn the the White Tower into his harem, Lanfear might come back and start dating Loial.... But I'll never find out because Robert Jordan is not getting another freaking cent out of my wallet!I am sure I am not alone."
1,Great Prologue - Horrible Book,"I started reading ""Crossroads of Twilight"" hoping that the publisher or editor or somebody at TOR got the message from previous reviews that ""Winter's Heart"" was not what we Jordan fans expected. Alas, no such luck! Mat's dice in his head would fall out for lack of action. Let me start with the good point - it is a wonderful (wonderfully long) prologue to the next book. Lots of descriptions and insight. Having said that, the reader will still find the innumerable subplots, the unnecessarily similar names, and little or no action. There were steps taken but nothing towards any kind of sub-conclusion as in previous books. The cliff hanger ending is unthinkable given the amount of detritus the reader had to wade through to get to it. I want my money back. Save yours and borrow this from a library just before book 11"
2,Crossing into Boredom,"I really love the whole Wheel of Time series, but this last book is not even remotely good. I had really high hopes after, Winters Heart picked up the pace a bit from ""Path of Daggers"", but those hopes was crushed with this book. Now I'm begining to wonder if he'll really ever finish this series.I give this book 2 stars beacuse, 1 star is the lowest grade and it gets an extra star for being a part of the ""Wheel of Time"" series."
1,Wheel of Time = Waste of Time,"And I though that some of the previous books were slow! This is absolutely filler that could have come out of a random sentance generator. NOTHING happens at all in this book. He should be birched for foisting this drivel off on people that have been loyal customers of his in the past.Unbelievable that this guy is getting away with this.Well, no more for me. I might pick up the next one from the public library, or some such. But Robert Jordan is NOT getting any more of my money unless he stops milking this franchise and returns to the quality of the early stories in this series.Save your money, or if, like me, you have made the mistake of buying this, let the author know you are NOT happy."
1,Marathon,"This book along with book 8 was almost as excrutiating as reading the play by play on a marathon. He takes a step... he takes another step... he drinks some gatorade... he takes another step.The entire plot advancement contained in this book could have been confined in the first three or four chapters. Then maybe something could have happened! Book 9 was a promising turn-around, but...At least George R. R. Martin's new book is coming out in August."
2,Gotta Get Through It,This is a complete filler novel that takes the story nowhere. You've got to trudge through it to get through the series. Hopefully Sanderson will get rid of so much of the bloat that infected Jordan's writing.
1,How to meta game Wheel Of Time Series into a Choose your own adventure,"The best way to enjoy this series is to read up to book 4 then stop. In your mind at that point is contained all the magic and cool adventures that could possibly happen to the 3 friends who leave a small village and set off for adventure. If however, you were not able to do that and have ended up at this point of the series where there are 100 characters who have all become exactly the same and unidentifiable fear not!* The first thing you must do is place all your Robert Jordan books on one big shelf* Obtain different coloured paper* Buy some foldersThen simply begin to create a database of each character and colour code each of group, that way whenever you are reading the books and have no idea who has gotten to which point simply go to your easy file system and quickly check as to who you're person is and why you should care how their clothing effects their social status."
1,Not a very efficient writer,"I must agree with other reviewers who have complained about the length of Mr. Jordan's prose. I borrowed the CD version of the book to listen to while driving on business trips. It took about two CDs just to get through his prologue. That does seem a little excessive. It takes him a paragraph just to discuss a single action.Since I have to do quite a bit of travelling, I will probably finish the book on cd. However, there is no way I would ever buy the book."
1,This Wheel is Broke,For many years I have been an avid Wheel of Time fan. I absorbed every book RJ wrote. The last few though I have found myself plodding through. This one here was the worst. It is just the middle of a book. No end in sight & considering that it will most likely be 1.5 years before the next one I just can't take it anymore. He says only 2 more. My decision is to wait until he is finished and then buy the books and read the series through from start to finish... unless I am too old and can't read by then! This series is just way too long to be tortured by a piece of a story at a time! Instead read the Sword of truth series. While just as long and no end in sight at least he wraps up the story in each book!
1,"Books 1-6 was Jordan, who is this?","I absolutely love the series, I've converted lotsa Tolkienites into giving this a shot....but seriously, something has to start happening, waiting two years, for (as most reviewers rightly put it) what could have been described in a chapter in the earlier books is shameful....Where is the wit? the suspense, the empathy we had for the characters....It's a shame when great fantasy and sci-fi stuff, nearly always, lets the fans down by tapering off into a cashcow end!"
1,crossroads of what?,"I have to say that I was completely disappointed, along with the rest of Robert Jordans fans. I cant say that anything happened at all in this book. Instead of one great story, it now seems like youre reading a few separate stories that go nowhere. Jordan spends a few chapters on each, then just kind of ends the novel in some random place. I believe that Jordan has it in him to continue writing books like he did at the beginning of the series, Im just beginning to wonder if he wants to. This book was like one giant prologue. Just a bunch of filler. And I have to agree, he brought in way to many characters that have nothing to do with the main story. Way to many names to remember. I just have to wonder, after two years, what took so long? He could have summed this book up in a quarter of the pages... I just hope Jordan hears what his fans think and decides to make something happen next time"
1,I thought someone had peeled an onion....,"... but they hadn't. There were tears in my eyes at how atrocious this series has become. Lord of Chaos was the last great WOT book and, in light of the last four books, will probably remain so.In the midst of reading this book I kept hoping that the characters were real - not so that I could engage my ultimate fantasy of living in the WOT universe, but so I could wring their stupid, boring necks and tell them to do something... ANYTHING!Sometimes I read Crossroads of Twilight, but only very late at night when I can't get to sleep. I am up to page 278. Currently I am reading four pages each night, after which I feel mentally exhausted by the intellectually-crippling tedium of the proceedings that I immediately fall asleep.I used to listen to lectures on media law when I wanted to sleep, but now I have Crossroads of Twilight."
1,Frustrated?,"Do what I do. Start pulling for the Dark One. The dithering males don't deserve to win Tarmon Gaidon and the women simply deserve to die period. Have you ever seen a greater collection of hags in your life? Round up the lot of them and right when they begin to sniff and pull their braids and smooth their skirts, balefire them in their ample bosoms.Give em hell Shaitan."
2,What's the Hold Up?,"I turned page after page after page of this tome waiting for something interesting to happen. Tedium set in, my eyes glazed over, and extreme boredom took over.I now understand what ""jordanitis"" is all about; string along the reader and sell him books about nothing to maximize profit.I'm very close to abandoning this series the same way I did Terry Goodkind. Thank God for George R.R. Martin!"
1,Extremely Disappointing,"I have been a fan of Robert Jordan's books have the past five years and have read all of his books multiple times. However, Crossroads of Twilight was a let down. After waiting two and a half years I found this book to be unsatisfying. The plot devolpment was horrible, very subpar in comparison to Jordan's other novels. The circumstrances the characters find themselves in the beginning of the novel are nearly identical to those at the end.For the people that are big fans, like myself, I assume you will go on to by the book despite my criticism. For the people that are considering, skip it. You can go from the book 9 to book 11 (whenever that comes out) and not miss anything."
1,"Yet another horrible, painful experience from Mr. Jordan.","Can we save some trees and just end the pain? How many wasted pages have been printed to just get this neverending story published? I can't believe how I fell into this nonsense.WOT is now just a straight out cash grab by Robert Jordan and his publishers. He's not even a sell out, he has nothing to sell anymore, and he's filling pages with junk prose just to keep the cheques rolling in.There MUST BE A GROUP OF MONKEYS hired to pound on typewriters, with phrases thrown between like ,""gilded this..."", and ""girls tugging on braids..."", in order to write this gibberish.Mr. Jordan, you've won. You're a rich millionaire author who wasted over a decade of people's time. Now please put this stinking carcass you call fantasy literature to rest. You can RETIRE AND COUNT YOUR MONEY, and let the rest of us start reading some real literature."
2,PLEASE... can we move the plot forward??,"I waited a long time for this book to finally be published. The series has so much potential - despite its seemingly unnecessary complexity and volume of characters. This book does nothing to move the plot forward, presents no resolution to any of the plot twists, and ultimately adds nothing to the series. The character development is of no value, there are numerous editor slips (grammer, people, grammer), and there is no real story progress. Overall, one could omit this book from the series and lose nothing about the plot development, character positions (geographically or ideologically), and ultimately would have saved themselves many hours of useless reading. Mr. Jordan, please move the plot forward, get back to basics, and pre-read the book before publishing in the future. Remember the rule, if it does not contribute or move the story forward, delete it. As Stephen King said, Final Copy = Draft - 10%."
1,Read this review before reading COT!!,"I can't say anything that hasn't been stated 50 different ways before. Seriously, I got more enjoyment from spending a couple of hours reading the angry reviews on this website than I got from RJ's latest 700 page thesis on the merits of stout Two-Rivers wool. Some of the reviews are downright hilarious! I wish I'd written down some of the things people had to say, because they would make a better book than the book was....Summary: don't buy the book (or even bother to read it), Read the reviews instead!"
1,Please memorize 500 Aes Sedai names and associations,"Getting through this book was painful. So many pages for so little action. And who are these hundreds of Aes Sedai? Am I supposed to remember the associations and intentions of channelers with such similar names as Makuri Makira and Mikara? (I'm making those up, but similar examples abound in this book.) What a waste of time.And Perrin and Faile love each other. We get it. Do we need to be berated for 200 pages (in every book!) over how useless Perrin is without his wife?"
2,Not much happening here.....,"I remember being so eager to pick up this book after waiting so long after completing book 9. Upon finishing it, I can't say it was really worth the wait.Basically, as a majority of the other reviewers have stated, this installment goes nowhere fast. I tried to breeze through the beginning to get to some actual main characters, only to find that nothing was really going on with them either. Where as the other books in the series have some major conflict or battle in the end to make you feel like you accomplished something by reading it, Crossroads of Twilight has no such major event. Some minor plot twists was all that was given, in my opinion.I was left with a feeling of,""Huh!? That't it?""It's worth the read if you followed all the other books, but don't expect anything great or earth shattering to happen when you turn the next page."
1,This guy is milking this series something awful,"Get this book from a libaray or from someone unfortunate to buy it... Jordan is just milking this for the money...I live right next to him... you would think he had enough sports cars, but I guess he needs a few more houses too.I'd give the book a -5 star if I could."
1,I only gave it one star because I couldn't select 0.,"Robert Jordan wants your money, and he wants it so badly that he copy and pasted an entire novel just to get some very loyal fans to shell out for another book. The main characters do nothing, and three separate women spend their time explaining to us how you should behave in front of your maid. Whoopee. And then there are the weevils, dirty little devils that are spoiling the food. Okaay....It's unfortunate, but with everything the characters have been through before, a little weevil infestation shouldn't be worth 700 pages of whining and stalling. Where's the battle? Where's the action? Where are the main characters, even? Jordan neeeds to stop listening to his publishers and get back on track before he looses his entire following. This book sucks, and I'm sorry now that I ever started the series."
1,THE REAL REASON CoT stinks,"I have been a fan of WoT since '91. The initial books were great. About 5 years ago, as the books became worse, I read two interviews in a row and figured out the problem. One was from Stephen R Donaldson, who said that when he gets an idea, he immediately knows how many books that idea can sustain. RJ's interview stated that his inspiration was ""what would it be like to be tapped on the shoulder and told you are the Messiah?"" A brilliant idea, which sustained the first 3 books; after that it has been nothing but plot without spirit or a driving idea. Everything else negative that people have said is true-- the annoying characters, excessive descriptions, lack of plot progression, etc, but I think the deepest problem is that the inspiration for the series is dead. RJ--please just let the Dark One destroy everyone and start a new book with a new idea."
1,Crossroads of Twilight,"Very disapointing. RJ has created an incredible world with characters who the reader cares about. However, he has written himself into a corner. Rather than tying off subplots and starting new ones, he continues to expand the old and create the new. Almost 700 pages covers less than 6 weeks of time. Also, there is not one major battle scene, something RJ is especially good at creating and describing."
2,Now what I expeted.,"I truly appreciate Robert Jordans books. I have been following this series for years now. Each book always left you with a sense of ""whats gonna happen next... or is he a dark one..."" This book on the other hand just left me exasperated. Jordon strung everyone far to much in this book. He hardly touches on Rand. The action is NONE. He does a great job of establishing characters and closing some gaps left open from previous books however this book just leaves you dry. It almost make you not want to know what happens next. Its a good read as all Jordan books are, just seriously lacking in adventure or fantasy."
2,"Glimmers should be the title...slow, tried to be too clever","This is book 10 of the series, start with Eye of the world and read up to this one. With that said, the prologue(Glimmers for the E-book readers) seems to promise much more story movement. I read and re-read this book in the last week to make sure I was not missing something. The pace is way too slow, not enough about Rand, the Aiel, fain, most of the forsaken, Nynaeve...Perrin gets stupid, Matt gets boring and Egwene is much too careless. Rand is almost an afterthought,what are his plans? what happened to the Choedan Kal? I spent the last three monthes re-reading the entire series and was looking forward to some big progress toward the last battle, disappointed is definately how I feel! This is not Jordan at his best"
2,Wasted Paper,"I have been an avid fan of the series for years (feels like decades). I bought this book anticipating the best. I am disappointed. This book doesn't even really pick up where the last one left off. More to the point, it describes the event from another characters aspect and location around the time Rand cleanses the source of the taint. It does proceed forward a little, but not by much. This whole book could have been summarized at the beginning of each chapter related to the character involved. This was a huge waste of paper and time. I will continue to buy the books and read them, because I am too far in to not know how it ends, but give the public some credit. People will stop buying the books if you don't keep them interested. This book was not interesting at all, and rather boring."
2,glad I borrowed it from the library...,"...Overall I still enjoy the series, although the cliched ""why are women so hard to understand"" writing is starting to grate..."
1,Content? What Content?,"The guidelines for writing a book review say I should focus on the books content. Unfortunately, this book *has* no content to speak of. Jordan needs to learn how to write, Harriet needs to learn how to edit, and TOR should stop treating him as infallible because he most definitely is fallible. CoT is the proof of that. The Wheel of Time series has jumped the shark, and the sharp decline in quality of the past three books after such a promising beginning is truly sad."
1,Don't be fooled by fans with terribly low expectations!,"Well, I was excited about reading this book. That lasted until around page 50, where I wondered when anything good was going to happen. By the end of the book I realized with the exception of one thing happening with Egwene (at the very end), Jordan took us nowhere slowly. As I read the other reviews I can't help wonder why even a die-hard fan would give this more than the minimum 1 star. Most of these say it's a case of Jordan setting up the next big books. I think they've been saying that for 4 books now. Don't fall for it. ... Don't do it! Don't fork over cash for this book. Try a different author instead!"
1,This would be funny if it weren't so sad,"Note to RJ: You already killed the cow, you can stop trying to milk her now.Note to prospective readers: Buy something by George R R Martin instead."
1,A BIG WAIST OF TIME,"A big waist of time , the only thoughts that come to mind in regards to book 10 of this series. The 95 page prologue was bad enough, but the chapters just ramble on about nothing that has any relevance to the story line. Endless chapters about shawls and smoothed skirts brings nothing to the story. What started out a series of well written books has now become filler. I hope that Mr Jordan writes the final book before fan loose interest and move on."
1,OMG,"is this book written by the same author or did he take a vacation somewhere and had one of his editors write this bs?With the exception of some death-watch guard, this book doesnt move forward at all. It just a fills in what everyone else does while Rand was cleanse the taint on the source. This book has no plot what-so-ever. Its definitely the worst book that RJ has ever written.I'll still be buying his books just to see to the end of the series, but wont be recommending this series to any more friends."
2,Perfect bedtime reading,"This is a pretty nice book to curl up with just before bedtime-- I was never once tempted to read beyond midnight, and yet I still looked forward to spending a little time (yes, sometimes too little) in the lives of these enjoyable characters every night. But, really Robert-- a little plot doesn't hurt every now and then."
2,Two authors or One??,"I have been an avid Wheel Of Time Reader since the beginning. This latest book was worth about 4 chapters. The other ""million or so"" words seemed to have been put to paper by a different author. The phrasing and word choices were different than the unusually cunning usages that Mr. Jordan has given us in the past. Does Mr. Jordan have a ghost writer? If so, tell them to just put this series to an end and start something new. One last book for all of us diehard fans, will be more than sufficient. Don't bother buying the book unless you are a true fan and even then only buy it if you can't borrow it from a friend."
1,Wheel of Time keeps spinning,"A major disappointment. Little plot development, endless descriptive paragraphs with little contribution to the storyline or character development, basically hundreds of pages with virtually no movement. I had been a big fan, but in the future I suspect if I read any more Jordan it will be a paperback. Given the torpid pace of this book, it is likely you could pass over it and still pick up the next volume without missing a step."
1,The never ending story - g'mme a break,"I've followed this series with the original eye of the world that was released in paperback. That book mentioned that it was the first book of a trilogy. Nine books later... apparently Robert Jordan has decided to milk this story for the rest of his life. Although the first three books were outstanding, nothing of substance happened in the last7 books!?! I for one have gotten to the point that I don't really care what happens anymore. I would have bought this book if the story came to conclusion, but from reading all of the other reviews it's just waste of more time. Robert, if your reading this, GET ON WITH IT. I'd be a lot harsher in my review, but you know what they say about being an author vs. a critic <sigh>"
1,Crossroads of Twilight--disappointment from start to finish,"At first I hoped that I was only imagining that the 95-page prologue was meandering and meaningless. Unfortunately, the following 600+ pages were just as meandering and meaningless. Mr. Jordan exercises an incredible ability to build sub-plots that go into more (unnecessary) detail and depth than the main plot(s) and apparently serve no real purpose. I've waited eagerly for the last few books in the series. Now it's like Star Wars...I'll buy it and I'll read it, but only to get some sense of closure. I no longer ""eagerly await"" the next pieces of story; just PLEASE get it over with. If you're a die-hard fan, buy this book. If you're sort of a fan, wait for the paperback. If you've never read the series don't waste your money on this one."
1,Plot??,"I have to agree with other negative reviewers. I have been a fan of the Wheel of Time since the beginning and Jordan's current trend is frustrating.Crossroads of Twilight just had no major plot ocurrances. There is the usual characterisation, but nothing of interest happens! As we are getting near the end of the series you would think that things be be heating up.I ask you....a 90 page prologue with no major characters just to go over what has already happened??With all the things that need to be done, the rescue of Faile, the storming of Tar Valon, the romance of Mat and Tuon, a united Caemlyn, not forgetting the final battle.....will the series go on forever?? Please put us out of our misery Mr Jordan."
1,The Series that just won't die ...,This series is going absolutely no where in a hurry. The author has so many minor character story lines still going its ridiculous. What started out as a series that moved ... kept you engaged has turned into a crawl the last several novels.Did he change editors?Read something else ... maybe the rest of the series will quietly die or show up for free at a half-finished unreadable rummage sale by 2025.
2,If You Value Your Books By the Page,"Folks, I have tried, really tried to enjoy this series. Jordan has creaed such a wonderful world with interesting characters, but I am now at the end of Book 5, and I plan to abandon this series. It seems many readers simply continue to read because they have ""so much invested"" they don't want to end the insanity. I am honestly dumbfounded by Jordans' writing style, no other author I have ever read draws out a plot as he does. It is mind-numbing and boring. Like other reviewers, I find myself trying to read ahead in a desperate attempt to find something interesting. If you are just starting out reading the Jordan saga, I recommend you stop and save your sanity."
2,Slowest installment yet,"I waited anxiously for 2 years before this 10th book in the Wheel of Time series came out. I read the reviews here and they convinced me not to rush out and get the hard-bound edition. Man! I'm glad I waited too!820 pages of which only 1 chapter chronicled the activities of the main character Rand. Sheesh! Lots of talk about him, but almost none of the other supporting characters and substories interacted with him. In Book 9, he cleanses Saidin of the evil ""taint"" of it and yet none of the other characters even know about it.All my griping being said by many other fans of this series, I will still anxiously await to read reviews of the 11th book in this series before I decide to buy the hard-bound edition immediately or wait for the paperback one.I only hope that Jordan's remaining days of life will permit him enough time to finish this story before one or both of us die."
3,Still dragging on,"Crossroads of Twilight is another book in a long line of over-discriptions and tiny shifts. I am still waiting for something to happen in this series. RJ hasn't written a book that has satisfied his readers since book 4. That said, the reader is left in a place that gives hope for the WOT series actually getting somewhere next go 'round. There are too many characters for the author himself to keep up with, and I don't care as much as he seems to just what each Aes Sedai in the room is wearing. Not at all satisfying, but it leaves hope for future installments. Let's all hope there really are only three more to suffer through."
2,A great night-time sleep aid!,"My feeling is exactly as I read read in other reviews... NOTHING happens, Rand makes an appearance for about twenty pages, and oh yeah, just how much embroidered silk do we need to hear about?? I think his overly detailed descriptions of what people were wearing took up a combined total of 450 pages! All the pertinent happenings could have been told in 100 pages. The first few books of the series kept me up to all hours of the night... this one put me sleep before night even came."
2,Disappointing!,"I felt that very little moved forward in the story. While I enjoyed everything as I read, when I got to the end all I could do was say ""Thats it?!?!"" Two years is a long time to wait, and I hoped for more. None of the cliffhangers from ""Winter's Heart"" were answered, at least not completely. I would have liked at least one thing to get resolved. I guess my final vote is indeed, disappointing. Great reading, but at the end, I was not satisfied."
3,Jordan's quantity now beginning to lack quality,"I have as always, eagerly looked forward to the current installment of the WOT CoT. Jordan'd first 6 books in the series were probably some of the best ever written in the fantasy genre. Alas the last 4 including including CoT have been very dissapointing. Jordan appears to be milking the WOT and at book 10 one feels he is not closer to a conclussion. This book has more new plots and twists with little or no resolutions to old ones. Still worth the purchase for Mats's Story and also in the hope that one day Jodan will finish!!! in the style he started. Basically a filler book.!!!"
1,700 pages of nothing,I loved the first 7 books in the series. The past few have just been about making a buck so you will buy more books. NOTHING happens in this book. Did I need to read 700 pages to find out that all the characters are in exactly the same spot as they at the end of the last book? PLEASE! I'm writing to the publisher to complain
1,To RJ: It stinks!,"I wanted to like this book I really did. There were only a few parts that I found to be interesting, such as the scene with Alviarin and Perrin's interrogation. Unfortunately that didn't justify the rest of this book. All of the scenes with Elayne were awful, I didn't care anything about that siege or the politics at all. Rand was hardly in it also, after accomplishing so much in the previous book, that's absurd. This was not the quality writing I expected after waiting so long. I don't buy the argument that this is a setting up book either, I don't feel that you need an entire book to set up your plot. Jordan should be ashamed of himself for putting out this terrible quality book.He owes us book 11 much sooner, and it needs to be far better than this or I'm done with the series."
1,I quit,I quit. I started reading this series in high school. I think I was able to read up to book five(?) before having to wait for the next book to be published. I graduated from college last year. I don't mind waiting years to read the next installment of a quality series but tWOT hasn't been a quality series for quite a while now. This book was the final straw.
1,Crossroads of Twilight,"A waste of time!! Wasn't this series originally supposed to end with the 10th book? There is no good reason to drag this out.Jordan has lost the respect and appeal he gained with the earlier books in the series.Guess I'll reread Glen Cook's Black Co. series again(best ending ever!) and hope George R.R. Martin finishes A Feast for Crows soon.Boy, did he ever raise the bar with the Fire & Ice series!! Better to do it his way and take more time and deliver something that satisfies than the tripe Jordan has turned out the past couple of books."
3,As the snails go rushing by,"Slow. Very little plot advancement--even less than the previous book in the series. Jordan took nearly 400 pages to catch all of the plot lines up to the ending of book 9 (Winter's Heart). Too many characters to keep track of, and one of the main characters, Nynaeve, didn't even appear in this book. Someone compared this book to ""filler"" and I have to agree. Come on Jordan, finish the series. This is getting old. On the plus side, Jordan is a good writer and is able to make me feel like I'm there. I also enjoyed the interplay between Mat Cauthon and the Daughter of the Nine Moons."
1,A disappointment in a great series,"Let me start out by saying that I would defend every other book in the Wheel of Time series. Though some were certainly better than others, I liked every one and have reread the series numerous times. But, Mr. Jordan has finally written a book that even I can't say I like. I was unaware that it was possible to write a 700-page book about ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. But, I now know that it is possible.I look forward to the next work in the Wheel of Time series. I hope that Mr. Jordan can return to his previous standards of excellence. And, for those of you who plan to continue the series to its finale, I would recommend reading this book just so that you catch the bits and pieces of seemingly important information that Mr. Jordan sprinkles in. However, don't go into this with any high expectations."
1,Has Robert Jordan gone senile?,"Despite the waning of this series, ""The Wheel of Time"" has consistently provided; believable characters, thick and rich detail, well thought out development, well paced action, and an amazing world parallel to our lives but with enchanting differences. Crossroads of Twilight has NONE of that. The characters feel stale, and uninteresting. The detail that Jordan had so mastered was taken to excruciating levels. I couldn't stand reading through four pages about what the feel of the camp and the inside of a tent was. After it was already introduced!Each of the characters separate plot lines lead to nothing. No form of resolution, no answers to previous questions, and tedious new questions.Ether Robert Jordan is trying to sap every last dime out of this series, he has the worst case of writers block ever (despite almost 700 pages 0 content!), or he is senile.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK UNTELL THE NEXT ONE COMES OUT. Then make sure that one is not tripe either."
2,672 pages of limbo!,"If I had it to do over again, I would wait until book 11 comes out and then read COT. In this volume each of the major characters makes a small, incremental step toward the next book while managing not to do anything interesting.Very disappointing."
2,Dissapointing - very little plot advancement,"I'm a big fan of WOT, but this book is very dissapointing. At least in the last book, we had something big happen with Rand cleansing Saidin. In this book, very little happens with the plot and a lot of it is just people who can channel noticing Rand wielding a ton of the One Power and their reactions. One of the few good things in CoT is that we get to see more of Mat."
2,RJ - please start paying attention to your fans!,"Up until a couple of days ago, I thought I was a diehard WoT fan. Sure the last few books have been a little bit slower, but there has been something interesting or exciting happening in all of them. The last book ended with one of the most momentous developments in the entire series....but it was barely addressed in this book! Almost nothing happened in this book. No single storyline was even close to resolved. Rand had about 20-40 pages in the entire book and that didn't even come until past the five hundred page mark. I'm sure that Robert Jordan is doing exactly what he wants to with this series, and that's fine. It's HIS series. But after this book, a think that there will be a lot of fans who no longer have the patience or the desire to follow him in what has become a long-winded, irrelevant hollow shell of what could have been a great saga."
2,A Whole Bunch of Nothing,"While the book is written well, it is filled with a whole bunch of nothing. I think this is a dirty trick the author is playing. There are so many stories being told, that at this rate, the series will require 50 or more books to complete the story. It's time to start tying them together. I really don't want to be 50 years older waiting for the end of the story. But then, I suppose that is good for his wallet. I say, get the story told!!!"
3,More of a setup,"This book seems to set the stage for dramatic plot advancement in the Egwene, Perrin, Rand, Mat arcs, but no major actions occur except at the tail end for Egwene.It's not a bad book, but not up to par with The Dragon Reborn or Lord of Chaos.My advice is to wait until the next book in the series and read them both in sequence. It won't feel so much like a sleeper then (I hope). This book feels more a setup for the next novel.My fears are that RJ is getting afraid of intense action or having trouble maneuvering his characters toward Tarmon Gaidan (the final climactic battle).Maybe he needs more long-range planning."
3,Not too different from other reviews,"Ok, anybody who's reading this review is evidently interested in book 10 of this series. With that in mind I would simply like to say that I, too, am disappointed at how the series is seemingly screeching to a halt in terms of the pace of events. However, as I read the entire series in a matter of weeks, I can't say I won't buy the next book as soon as it hits the shelves. So if you've got the time, give these books a shot, but please don't expect the same pace out of this book as in the first few of the series."
3,"Not fabulous but not horrible, either.","No, the plot doesn't advance much, but ""Crossroads of Twilight"" is still a pleasant, fast read and by no means the literary travesty many here make it out to be. Other installments in the series had more hugely dramatic developments; I think this one was genuinely meant to be a book of more modest pleasures. As such, I think it works just fine. I'm still on board for the next one."
1,Crap,The absolute worst piece of crap I've ever been subjected to. There ought to be laws covering crimes such as this.
2,Jordan's Weaved A Pattern He Can't Control,"...P>Jordan has weaved himself a pattern that there is still no end in site. Nothing happens in this book, that couldn't have been writen in 200 pages. There is no movement of plot, and very little building of characters.He has 3 easy chances in this book to close certain plots, but instead he drags them on, and introduces new problems to these plots. You could easily skip this book and go straight into number 11, if it ever comes out, and not miss a step.Don't get me wrong, Jordan is as colorful and detailed as ever, and that is the problem, I don't need to know EVERY LITTLE DETAIL OF EVERYTHING, just the main points!At this rate, the end won't come till book 15-20, and who knows if he is even going to be alive by then to finish it."
1,waiting for godot,"It appears that Jordan has forgotten for most authors, the key to a good story is that there is a good story. One that brings you from a beginning to a hopefully rousing end.I guess he is too caught up in the warp and the woof of the weave of time that always is a beginning; not THE beginning, but a beginning, and absolutely never, never an ending.Frankly, no one would have missed anything in the plot development if this last volume of WOT was balefired out of existence.I most regret having bought all his books in hardcover... now it seems that they, if ever completed, would take a space on my bookshelf larger than the encyclopedia britannica, and yet tell a story that goes nowhere"
2,Could this be the reverse of book 6?,"I mean by this.... Book six is really a continuation of book five but with to many pages to fit in one binding. After reading this book I see it as the first half of one very long installment. The other reviewers are correct though, nothing really happens. Also, one reviewer mentions that you should wait and see how many more books there will be. According to Mr. Jordan, as of last fall, there will be two more installments."
2,Thoroughly mediocre,"Robert Jordan has proven himself to be an excellent writer in the majority of his books in this series, but it seems that the pace of his story has become excessively lethargic. This book continues a disturbing trend of focusing on less-than-pertinent minutiae in a plodding play-by-play of the charaters' actions. Until the last 30 pages or so there is no actual advancement of the plot, and even then all he provides us is foreshadowing of important events that, given his current plot pacing, may not occur until a thirteenth or fourteenth book.While I admire Mr. Jordan's style of writing, I find myself having to be an apologist to my friends regarding the quality of this book and the future direction of this series.In short, I am unsure where he is going with his magnificent story. I apprehensively await the next installment."
1,NOTHING HAPPENS IN THIS BOOK!!!,"While I wasn't expecting his book to be action packed, I found myself turning page after page wondering when SOMETHING, ANYTHING would happen. I did get one smidgin of action near the very end with an apparent abduction of one of the main characters, but the situation never evolved. Let me state that I am a HUGE fan of the WOT series. I think the whole mythos is wonderfully developed, highly entertaining, and intellectually stimulating. However, I read this book with the thought that Robert Jordan must not be able to decide where he wants to go with this. I felt the book was written as a money maker, NOT a continuation of an incredibly rich tapestry. This is the first WOT book that actually bored me. Not your best work Mr. Jordan. I'll hold out hope for the next installment."
1,Somebody Fire The Editor,"Now I've read all of Jordan's books. There's a lot in there that's good, and the series started off so well. Somewhere however, the series has become lost and mired in intricate plot that has no momentum or direction. Many have blasted Jordan, but I would suggest another source: THE EDITOR. Who in the heck could be signing off on this and saying with a straight face, ""Yeah, that's great Robert. Maybe you should introduce a few more plot lines and characters"". Fire the editor, get Jordan back on track and let's bring this puppy to conclusion. Write another series in the same world later, but for the love of all that is good, please finish it. I hope the folks at TOR are reading these reviews."
1,A book about nothing,"Harriet - What I need is an idea for a new bookRobert - I got it! One word: Nothing!Harriet - Nothing? What's nothing?Robert - An idea for the book! everyones writing about something, we'll write about nothing!Harriet - so, i walk into Tor Publishing and say I got an idea for a bookRobert- WE walk into Tor PublishingHarriet - We? Since when are you a writer?Robert - Who's talking about writing? This is a pulp soap opera fantasyHarriet - Alright, so we walk into Tor Publishing and say we got an idea for a book; they say, ""what's your book about?"" we say, Nothing!Robert - nothing!Harriet - but even nothing is somethingRobert - You'd be suprisedHarriet - but why would people buy a book about nothing?Robert - because it's been publishedHarriet - ....You might have something here!"
1,Unbelievable comments,"I'm giving this one another one-star performance due to the insulting and sanctimonious comments offered by defenders of the book. To be told that people like myself must be a part of the ""TV"" generation and must have not read the previous nine novels only helps prove the level of delusion many of these defenders are suffering from. Look at the endless list of one-star reviews....THAT says it all, my friends."
1,I don't think that he knows what's going to happen next,"I've never seen a book that spent so much time going nowhere. In the entire book, nothing happened to advance the story. There was not a single confrontation involving channeling. Come to think of it, there was not a single confrontation. I think that either Jordan has no idea how to finish this story or he is trying milk this series and extend it indefinitely. He'd probably make more money if he wrapped it up and just got down to selling ""deluxe gift boxed sets"". At this pace, no one will be around to read the conclusion. We all will have long ago given up on him ever finishing."
4,Please finish the story!!,"This installment gains more ground, definately more than book nine. All the various and wonderful plots hint at coming together. If you've gotten this far, you really have to continue, howerer Mr. Jordan, PLEASE!! finish this.I swear by the Goddess of the books, never again will I start a series until the last book has been written!"
3,the required book,This book is setting up the final dash to the end of the story. Despite all the nay sayers the plot did advance although not as much as i had hoped. It is also the first time in the entire series we arrive at a book where the major plot lines are converging.
1,Time to give up on the series,"Too many minor characters to keep track of, and nothing much happens in this book. I am giving up on the whole series and moving on to authors who are better writers and know how to keep a story going. Robert Jordan will waste no more of my time!"
1,The greatest book I've ever read!,"I LOVE THIS BOOK!!! God, I can't get enough, this is the most amazing book in the history of mankind.Let me explain. You see I have, for some time, had trouble falling asleep. Nothing worked (except large amounts of alcohol, and that brought on its own set of problems), until I got this glorious piece of sh...literature.Afterwards, I couldn't fall asleep fast enough! This book is so dull and tedious, its like paper chloroform. Thank you, Robert Jordan!P.S. The best part is that even after I finally finished the book (probably in my sleep), I can still use it for its god-given purpose. All I have to do is think back to any part of this ""torture-with-letters"", and I'm out like a rock."
1,the worst book so far,"I was hugely dissappointed to find that book 10 is the slowest moving book thus far. (at least it seemed like that to me) I skimmed over much more than I read in hopes of finding something resembling a storyline. There was so much useless drivel and description that I fell asleep reading Robert Jordan several times!! (a first)Who am I to say ""don't buy""...if you've stuck with the series this far, in all likelihood, you'll buy as I did regardless of the poor reviews. But ""don't buy"". Get on a waiting list at a library. RJ needs to quit milking his previous success."
1,Whole lotta nothing going on,"As a series, you have to have the book, however, read the first and last 5 chapters and you'll keep your sanity.Jordan has succumbed to the ""people will buy anything"" crossroads(pardon the pun) in his writing. As far as I can tell, only one 'thing' happens in this book. It is basically 500 pages of telling life stories of people you never heard of and on the whole, this book could be a five page pamphlet for all that gets resolved.Mr Jordan, please end this now!"
2,I want my money back.,"I was a latecomer to the Wheel of Time. I obviously liked it, because I read ten books. This book felt like an episode of daytime television. Nothing meaningful happened, and I wondered if Jordan really means to keep writing the series until they nail his coffin shut. I actually took the book back to the store and demanded a refund. I have NEVER done that with a book before. I felt like I was being exploited by the author for his own pecuniary gain. Very disappointing. You see, I like Egwene and Rand and especially Perrin and the rest of the Scooby gang. And I want to see the story resolved, but I'm not going to read ten more books that don't do anything to get it. I compare this to say, Robin Hobb, who wrote nine books in the same world and somehow never bored me at all."
1,"Dull, Duller, Dullest","When you are 6,800 pages into a series its hard to just give up and stop reading becuase the series is moving so slowly. However this is what ive finally done. The main character Rand is only in 20 pages of the 680. All the other pages are dull, without action, and involve only secondary plots. I actually returned the book I was so discusted with it."
1,Hmmmm...,"This book was extremely disappointing. The first couple of books in this series were very good, but they have most definitly been getting slow. In fact they have slowed down so much, this one literally moved backwards. 680 pages of absolutly nothing. I congradulate you Mr. Jordon, i don't know many authors who could have filled that many pages and yet nothing happened. I guess I'll read the next because the series does have some good characters (the ones i could keep up with) and on the positive side there's nowhere to go but forward, right?"
1,Jordan is loosing it.,"I don't know how this book ever got published. You would think that one of the proof readers would have told RJ how bad it ..... The WOT series has changed A LOT since I started reading them back in 1993. The first books were full of action and adventure, but the last 3 (including this one) are some of the most boring stuff I've ever read. Nothing happens in this book. Can I say it any more simple then that? Absolutely Nothing Happens. Very dissapointing."
2,Why is this series so addictive?,"It's like the taint on Saidin. You keep turning pages, despite being sickened by the foulness, the bilgewater prose, the repetition, the sheer idiocy of it all.I swear Jordan must be trying to set a couple of records here. Aside from the ""Longest Novel Ever Written"" record he would appear to be aiming at achieving some level of superlative with regard to slowness of exposition. The first 350 pages of this book take place prior to, or simultaneous with, the events described in the last chapter of the previous book. That is, half of this nearly 700-page long book, doesn't manage to move the overall plot's timeline foreward by even a single day."
1,Is Robert Jordan still writing these?,"This book was terribly disapointing. He spent the first 500 pages retelling the end of the last book,then in great detail nothing much happened the rest of the book. I loved the first books in this series but now I doubt I'll finish it."
1,Unbelievably BAD,"This is just so sad -- Jordan could have had a phenomenal 5-book series, that would have gone down in history as one of the greatest fantasy series ever. Instead, he seems to think that we readers like to read hundreds of pages that describe background characters that we don't care about and have nothing to do with advancing the story.The only way he'll ever end this series and put us out of our misery is if we stop buying the hardbacks -- be patient and wait for the paperback version or read it from the library."
1,quantity rather than quality,"I was fortunate to discover TWoT series for the first time last year. I had the pleasure of reading all 9 books one after the other, and enjoyed all of them, even the weaker installments. So, I was waiting with bated breath for Number 10 and bought it as soon as it hit the shelves (in hardback too, which is something I rarely do). I should have waited for the paperback edition. The latest installment is very poor. Turgid plotlines, seemingly unending chapters of characters meandering through the plot: even the villans seem distracted. The only entertaining section was that describing Mat and Tuon. Hopefully, book 11 (if it ever arrives) will be better......."
3,Lack of Progress,"I'm a huge fan of this series, as such I really liked this book as its one more chapter in one of the best fantasy series (at least so far) out there. But the lack of progress in this book is annoying. Half the book is one day from everyone else's perspective (Rand's perspective having been in the last book). Although a lot of action has been set up for the next book I really wish he would collapse some of these story lines and start moving to an end. At this rate Robert Jordan won't survive long enough to write the end of the series."
1,Wheel of Time?... Waste of Time!,"Utterly, utterly auwful. Mr. Jordan, do yourself a favour and simply disown this book altogether. Just think, you could simply stand up and say 'no, I'm sorry, it was a terrible mistake' then write another book ten, which, hopefully, would be the last in this already hoplessly elongated series.The only reason you should buy this book is as fuel for the fire. And with the amount of drivel Joran puts out, it would probably give quite an appreciable burn-time.Yes, the great, seven-spoked wheel has finally ground to a halt - and to be frank I no longer care."
1,Time to redeem yourself Mr Jordan,"I'm afraid that like many readers of The Wheel of Time series, I have come to the aptly named crossroads, i.e. do I really care what happens to the characters anymore? The first few books were excellent, but Mr Jordan appears to have lost the plot. We have a comedy series on TV in the UK called Little Britain, in which one of the characters is an author who tries desparately to pad out her stories in order to write enough pages for a book. Her catch phrase is ""How many pages now Audrey?"", to which her trancriber invariably comes back with a figure of 10. Could Mr Jordan be having similar difficulties? I feel there could be a positive side to this if Mr Jordan is aware of the reviews his books are receiving... It's not too late to provide a cracking book or two and end the series to acclaim, in the same way it started."
2,"Otherwise Known as ""Wheel of Money""",Man must be getting paid by the word. Robert Jordan is never going to finish the series. He is going to keep on writing stories that get progressively worse with characters that get darker and less interesting with each page of one of his 1000 page booksFor those of you thnking about starting this serise stop at #3 please take my advice.
1,"WOT Changed my Life, COT just about Ended It",Eye of the World was the first book I ever read for pleasure reading. I absolutely fell in love with it. I have been biting my nails waiting for every new release. I forgave Winters Heart for dragging because of the amazing Ending.Crossroads of Twilight had nothing. It kept going on and on about characters that I couldn't even keep straight. They are all minor characters who have names spelled very closely.I think I have officially Switched over to Sword of Truth Series by Terry Goodkind. (A new novel about once a year instead of every 2 and there is absolutely no plot lagging there)
1,my first and last robert jordan book,"awful. i can't imagine how the author can publish such rubbish. basically, nothing happens."
2,Waste of Time,"Nothing happends. Robert Jordan takes a thousand pages to say NOTHING. Nothing is resolved, Nothing happends at all. Everyone is just waiting, and waiting, and waiting. If you absolutely must read the next in this series, go for it, otherwise leave this one alone. Believe me, you will not have missed anything. Maybe next time his chariters will actually do something."
2,Too little - Too late,"Don't get me wrong... I love this series, and will have every book on pre-order when available, but this book was definately unimpressive, and completely forgettable.When you have 8 or 9 major characters/storylines running at the same time, it is hard to progress all the characters... So what you have here is many short stories where next to nothing happens for the entire book. This is NOT what I would have expected after waiting 2 years after book 9. There is SOME plot progression, but not muchWhile not a complete waste of time, it is the next best thing to it.I can't wait for book 11... maybe in 2 or 3 years. I hope he finished this series before he dies of old age. 10 books in 15 years, each one later than the last."
1,As bad as the 8th...,"I have read all the serie (except for the perquel). I bought all books, one by one and read through the 7 firsts with thirst. Sadly, the 8th book was dragging and most uninterresting, but for the sake of the whole story I read it. The 9th book was a relative improvement, in part thanks to the last chapter.The 10th ? as bad as the 8th. It sounded as a wrap up of EVERYONE around the conclusion of the 9th, and for the firsts 600 or so pages, nothing that really was new.I just have a simple question, how many dragging books will be written before this story actually ends ? Every good story needs an end, and this one was due 2 books earlier. I loved the 7 firsts, but not the lasts 3."
2,What has happened in this book,"As I was nearing the end of this book, I asked myself ""What has happened in this book?"" It had very little action. This was definately the slowest of all the books in the series so far. I have enjoyed all of the others in the series and this is the first time I was wondering why I was reading it. This book is not a reason to stop reading the series, but hope that the next ones will climax as expected."
1,Waste of time.,"I very rarely do NOT like a fantasy book, but this one is really bad. Anyone who compares this guy to Tolkien should be shot on site ;-)Seriously, I have enjoyed some of the installments (esp. early ones) in the Wheel of Time series, but this one misses the mark by a mile."
1,ugh,what a disappointment!! i can't believe i wasted $40 bucks on this book! R.J.'s books have gone into the crapper but at least something interesting happened in winter's heart.... but this book really really sucked! he is dragging out this story and boring us to death in the process. after the 6 or so books the last few have been a bitter disappointment. i'll be renting his next books from the library....not wasting my good money on them.
1,Mr. Jordan should be ashamed,"This book is an insult to his many formerly devoted readers--it is the most blatant example I've ever seen of an author trying to perpetuate something out of nothing and benefitting financially in the process. Why Mr. Jordan didn't stop to think that his readers might be put off by this is a mystery. I personally will never buy another of his ""books"" again. This was pure drivel, and boring drivel at that."
1,Wheel of (Filler)...Time,"Robert Jordan should be embarassed by writing this book and compelling consumers to reading yet another 600 + pages of filler. ... For those faithful fans not yet disappointed, a point of advice.....SKIP THIS BOOK! NOTHING HAPPENS OF ANY CONSEQUENCE! As for me, I'll wait on the next book and hope others will act as litmus paper, giving me insight regarding the readability of what's to come."
1,Robert Jordan drags out another,"It's a shame... once again, Robert Jordan shows his talent for drawing the series out even further, giving the story more twists and complications when he should be resolving the 4,009 plots he's already introduced. C'mon, RJ, how much more involved can you make this? The Wheel of Time puts soap operas to shame for the sheer drag-it-out factor.It wouldn't be so bad if the time between books was decreasing. But instead, fans waited two years and three months for this last book... as opposed to the *mere* two years they waited for the previous book. How long will he make us wait for another book that complicates the plot even further? My grandkids will no doubt father children who will be wondering when the series will end.Boo to Robert Jordan. He's become a money-hungry, greedy writer with more concern for his own pocket than his fans. His books no longer provide satisfying content and just plain take too long to produce.This will be the last of his series that I read."
1,Jordan's Summer House,"""Crossroads.."" is obviously filler material that either Jordan or his publisher insists upon foisting on the reading public. Its unfortunate that at a time when fantasy and sci-fi have finally won some semblance of respectability, a snake-oil rip off like this (not to mention the last two books) rears its ugly head. Shame on Jordan. Shame on the publishing house, and shame on me for spending my money on this poorly disguised attempt to fund a vacation villa for Mr. Jordan."
1,ARGH=>never pre-order ZERO STARS!!!!!,"I made the mistake of pre-ordering this book. Never again, never. I totally agree with most of the reviews except one, i no longer have hope this series will go anywhere=>no hope. there is a term that discribes this book BORING, SPACE KEEPER, CONTRACT FULFILMENT."
3,"Disappointing progress, if you can, wait for paperback!","I was looking forward to this book for a year! re-reading the last book in time to pick-up Crossroads.I was very dissapointed. Don't get me wrong it is a good book, but focus in mainly on Egwene. With only small tastes of Mat and Tuon, and almost no Rand. Jordan put a big knife in the back of many fans with this book. Can we get a re-write? haha.And is the introduction suppose to be so pointless? I have never read a book that was so much about nothing.If the next book is like this one, Jordan has lost me forever."
3,Who's editing these books?,"I agree with most of the reviewers who feel that while I love the story and the characters, the last few installments have lost momentum. However, my major beef is with the editors of this book (and for that matter, book 9 as well). Who is editing these books? Granted, these are mammoth tomes, and it would be impossible to catch every minor grammatical error. But when I seem to find at least one error every few pages, it makes me question the thoroughness of the process. Hey, if the publisher needs some freelance editing help, let me know...."
2,Much Ado About nothing,"Well I finally ended reading Jordan's 10th torment. I have to say it was not as bad as I thought it might be but sure hell could have skipped a few chapters and get to the good stuff which apparently takes place in the last ..20 pages? Cmon, it is time for this series to end, unfortunately marketing is a wonderful business; I do hope that book 11 picks up the pace to a very satisfying conclusion. We deserve it MR JORDAN!!!! Let the final battle begin!!!"
1,Was a fan.,"I used to wait on pins and needles for Jordan's next book. Then he started taking more than a year for each one. This last one took longer and has almost no forward movement in it.I didn't buy this book immediately because of the price, ... I checked it out from the library and ended up skimming at least 85% of it. When #11 comes out, probably in 3 years, I will simply check Crossroads out again and give it a closer read...."
2,still have hope,"ok. this book pretty much stunk. all i was excited about was the inevitable meeting between Rand and Logain and that ended up being dissapointing. nothing happened. how long will it take get something done. the last bood ended so good. i would almost say it was as good as the end of Lord of Chaos.i still have some hope for RJ, though. remember that he is the same man who wrote Shadow Rising and Fires of Heaven. i hope he gets the ball rolling on the next book because this one was frustrating. it made me very angry that he had little to no time with Rand. very little mention of the cleasing of the taint, even though the jacket to the book mentions it. i also did not like the fact that most of the book took place before the end of the last book. i will still hope that the best fantasy writer of our time can redeem himself."
3,The longest mile,"This book is interesting, but really unnecessary. It only drags out the series. you could have added the last chapter to the beginning of the next book. R.J. must be contracted for a 12 book series. I foretell 2 more books at two years between. I hope I live long enough to see the end."
1,Yawn,"Prepare yourself to become utterly mired in minutia. As always, RJ does a fantastic job of making his world seem real. However, as has been suggested here and other places, most of this book could have been edited out without any loss to the series as a whole."
2,Wheel of Disapointment,"This chapter of the saga rambles on and on and settles nothing. There are no conclusions to any of the previous issues just lots of dialog and no action. Very wordy and boring.Jordan should provide some forward movement of the story lines and finish some of them, so he can start some new ones. I am very dissapointed, especially since I waited so long for this new book."
2,Not Up To Par,"Like many other people, I greatly enjoy the Jordan books. However, like many other readers I feel this one is not up to par. The characters talk and talk endlessly and never do anything more than take a bath or look through a telescope. ALso, the Prologue was tough for me to follow, and I have read each previous book! I hope this is not the end of the series! I can't recommend the book and don't think any reader will miss out if he jumps from the previous one to the next to come. Bummer! And now we all sit and wait another year or two. For those of you wanting something to read, try Robin Hobb or George R. R. Martin."
2,What?! I rushed through WoT for this?!,"I began reading the WoT series in June of 2002, and already I've finished reading CoT. I love the series, don't get me wrong, but number ten was VERY disappointing. It's great that an author would want to describe more of the world his books are written in, as well as current events within the series...but...where's the action? Where's the edge-of-your-seat feeling I got from reading 1-7 and 9 (sorry...ten seems to follow the monotony of eight). I'm waiting anxiously for number eleven, I just hope it's very soon and MUCH longer. Eh...this gives me some time to go back and review stuff in case I forgot, maybe even begin Terry G.'s Sword of Truth series. C'mon, Mr. Jordan, we want more!!"
2,Muddled.,"As with all of the books the writing is excellent and the plot full of deceit and intrigue. However it is far too drawn out slow moving. What Jordan could say in a page he takes a chapter for. Nothing is said about the male half of the True Source being used except for a line or two from Rand's miniscule part in the book. It was somewhat of a trial to get through the whole thing but nonetheless I read on, hoping that something important would happen. Only three very interesting things happened and one of them seems to be the setup for the plot of the next book. Nonetheless I would have to recommend it to people who are fans of the series because let's face it, there are things in here that you will need to know if you are going to read the next book and though it will be a slow ride just hope that the next book will make up for it."
2,How can it be more than 2?,I think we can all agree that Jordan is an excellent author. My disappointment is not in the writing but in the lack of movement within the storyline. I've never skipped a chapter before...before! I guess it'll be another 2 years for the next one. Since this 700 pg prologue sets up a promising 11th book. I would rather wait three years and have something worth reading.
2,Enough already,"Ok we get it, Jordan is fantastic at character development, but really, after 1000's of pages, I have a pretty good grip on the characters. I will definatly wait for reviews of 11 and find out if he actually advances the plot before buying it. If (like me) you can't stop reading the series despite its lethargy, check it out from the library."
3,and this took us where?,"While very well written, the book seems to be just filler...a way to make the series last longer. After waiting the extra couple of months since they decided not to release it until January, not to mention the time since the 9th book was released, I was totally disappointed. And I hate to say it since I am, or perhaps was, a dedicated fan, but I am starting to lose interest."
1,Insomnia Cure,"This book goes nowhere slowly. Mat is courting, Rand is resting with Perrin and Egwene dithering.It takes 30 chapters to say what could be said in 3. At this rate we'll all be dead of old age before the last battle.Has Robert Jordan lost the plot?"
1,Disappointing,"After 2+ years since the last, I was practically salivating for this book to come out. Like many fans of W.O.T., I reread the whole series to prep for the release of ""C.o.T."" And what we've ended up with is a book, the contents of which could have been summarized in a forward. There is virtually no movement in any of the storylines. There are far too many pages describing the outfits that everyone is wearing. The first 2/3 of the book takes place at the same time as the last 1/3 of the last book. Mr. Jordan, some resolution please."
1,Wait for Book 11.,"Big Battles, Conquests, Action & Intrigue are not to be found here. The book catches up our favorite Aes Sedai, Elayne, Egwene, Perrin & Mat from where we left off on book 9. VERY SLOWLY!!! Over half the book is dedicated to this goal. This was an awful slow read, no action, much plotting and finger pointing. The plot moves forward about a week, with little activity, with only one stupid ill-conceived action by one of our favorites for a new cliffhanger.I'm sure Robert Jordan put some foretelling in this book, and some plotting has taken place, but from my view, you probably can skip it and wait for book 11. The time taken to read this book was a complete waste."
2,Somebody Save ME!,"i must be brainwashed or something. i keep telling myself that i wont pay for another one of these books, but.....WHY CANT I STOP? its called curiosity. when you start reading TWOT series you kinda get into it and you really wanna know what happens to the characters of the story. But it never is enough and then you have to wait years for the next one to come out....it really is rather painful. These books suck you in like some kind of bizarre soap opera and here in hawaii, things usually come later then in any other place in the US. i HATE IT. bUT OF COURSE I'll probably buy the next one...Unless i die, or Robert Jordan dies...hey thats a thought, i wonder how old he is. WILL IT EVER END? anyway, if you really want to, read it.If you have all the books with you when you start, they really are rather interesting...but oh so painful when the story is cut off."
2,So boring...,"Book 10 can be summed up thusly: it recaps everything that occured in book 9, itself a stuttering bore until the final pages. This is the book where everyone stops and chats about things, what happened before, what they might like to do in the future. And, of course, endlessly complaining about things that they don't understand. Mat Cauthon, generally regarded as the next most exciting character, next to Rand, spends three chapters deciding to... pick up stakes and move a circus. Perrin spends over a hundred pages ... doing what he did in the last book, exactly nothing worth reading. Elayne spends several chapters discussing how she might consolidate power in Caemlyn. Egwene spends endless time discussing how she might overtake Tar Valon. If you've read the dust jacket you already knew all this! Reading this book is similar to having a friend tell you about a great movie, rather than seeing it yourself. Get to the action, man! Argh!"
1,"Finally a WOT book to match its ""Sweet"" cover.","Yet another 680 pages of turgid prose. PoD was bad, it was redeemed however by the battle at the end. I liked book eight (I can't even remember the name) for the battle with the Seanchan. This book however had NOTHING that was worth reading. Literally nothing. If you even go back to RJ's Conan books and those Fallon books you will find no peer to this garbage. Jordan has lost his reason."
1,Summary,"I wish I'd gotten a summary before I read the book, it can be summed up in two words-nothing happens. I'd thought book 10 was going to be the last but after 100 pages of boring dribble realized it might never end. In the future I will read it at a bookstore rather than wait for a year in anticipation"
2,I want my money back,Hundreds of pages of needless exposition with maybe 5 sentences of plot advancement. Vanity run amok as Jordan blatently milks his readers.
1,Tell me how it ends,"I simply cannot take another one of these installments. It became quite clear to me half way through this book that it was going nowhere so I decided to not finish it. There are entirely too many characters and after two years I have absolutely no idea who is who. There seem to be a million different Aes Sedai, Senchan, Sea Folk, Kin and Etc. Keeping them straight is difficult and when they do close to nothing, it seems pointless to try.This book was simply awful. I am deeply disappointed as once I looked forward to each installment with great joy, now, I will simply have to ask one of the poor souls who continue to suffer how it ended. I foresee this conversation taking place in ten to twenty years."
1,Please end something,"This book is a complete waste of time, ink, and paper.Other reviewers have bemoaned the lack of action. There doesn't need to be action if there is progress and conclusion to threads, sub plots, characters. There aren't ANY! In the author bio in the first few books there was a statement that RJ intended to write until they nail the coffin shut. I used to regard that as a promise. Now, I think it is a threat. Victor Hugo would have hidden his head in shame at the useless excess verbage."
1,Don't bother,"This one is the worst yet,and that's saying something, I only read it for the occational glimpses of his old style shining through.Unfortunatly it's too late for me to stop reading the series now, but if your new to the WoT then save yourself and get out while you still can, you will only be dissapointed."
1,Potboiler that WON'T end,"This series had a good start for the first three books or so, but it has devolved into many plotlines that are sometimes skipped for entire books. That would be okay if the story kept moving, but instead we are subjected to multi-paragraph long descriptions of characters dress and beliefs and then the character is never seen again. That isn't good writing, that is fluff and filler.The only reason I bought this book is because I had thought there would only be 10 books in the series since the pre-quel is out. Foolish me. Not only has Jordan given up putting serious effort into the series, he will NEVER FINISH IT. I not only suggest no one read this series, I suggest no one read this author unless you are into masochism.PS: How do you look at a ceiling and see that the square tiles ""interlock""? I mean, how can they be squares, yet be seen by an observer to interlock?"
1,Refund Please,"Content? We don't need no steeeking content.Or so Mr Jordan would have us believe. 620 pages of BLAH with maybe 50 pages of worthwhile material scattered through the entire book like corn through a fresh load in the bowl.Theonly good thing I am willing to say? No Nyv to *sniff* repeatedly.Plenty of tugging of skirts and knuckling of various features to more then make up for it. And don't forget a riveting expose on silk laundering.I'd call it drivel, but even drivel would say this ...."
1,RJ has been replaced by a computer program,Maybe RJ is dead and Tor has a computer churning out his books. Anyone seen him alive recently?Reading the user reviews is more interesting than reading the actual book.
1,"Filler, Filler and More Filler!","I used to be a rabid RJ fan ... read all the books many times over, made notes, cross checked clues, participated in e-mail discussion groups, etc, etc. Like everyone else, I have been increasingly disappointed with the last few books, but I have to say that this book was shockingly bad ... the book concludes about a quarter-inch farther than where the last book left off.We are subjected to rehearing every characters foibles as if we had not read the previous books (at book 10 I don't think the author should assume that the reader has not read the previous books). More importantly, I get increasingly frustrated that the ""good guys/gals"" cannot seem to add 2+2 and come up with 4... I know they can't be perfect (or we would have no story), but do they always have to be so clueless?As many others have observed, George R.R. Martin's ""song of fire and ice"" series is much better at keeping the pace going and keeping the characters interesting."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"This novel is simply horrible. It is the most boring read I have ever experienced with any author of anykind. I find sitting down and reading through a University text book is more enjoyable than reading through this book by Robert Jordan.Jordan should take story-telling lessons from George RR Martin, a much superior author."
1,Boring Waste of Prescious Resources,"If you want great fantasy as opposed to poor, read George RR Martin's series instead.Martin's characters and plot are both interesting-something lacking in this overdrawn boring series.If you enjoy reading pages of description irrelevant to the plot, you may enjoy this series. If suffering from sleep deprivation, read this series but keep a barf bag nearby.Comparing this series to the classics demonstrates a unfamiliarity with the classics and is an insult to the classics."
1,Disapointed,"I started this series because I had heard a lot about. Thefirst few were good and interesting. However as I readfurther into the series it became harder to keep up an interest. I'm usually a fast reader, but this one was a choreto read. I had to force myself to finish it. I will probably finish this series, provided it is finished in the next 10years. There are many things I don't like, the women, the1 to 1 kidnappings per book, these "" powerful "" peoplewho anyone can overpower. I see a silver collar around Rand'sneck in the next book."
1,Complete stall in action and hanging on unimportant details,"The saddest part is that I have had to defend Mr. Jordan for three books now with the friends I got addicted to the 'Wheel of Time'. Now Mr. Jordan has written one that I cannot defend. Absolutely nothing happens in this book. More unimportant characters are described in lavish detail. The only two items of interest are that both camps of Aes Sedai are entertaining alliances with the Black Tower and Egwene ends up captured by Tower Sisters. Other than that, you could skip this book entirely."
2,The new soap,"This book is reminds me of the daytime soaps on TV, you can skip this book and still not miss the story. I was disappointed that Mr. Jordan decided for ""fill"" instead of subtance when he published this 600+ pages that placed the reader no nearer the end to this saga. Mr. Jordan has been placed on the ""wait for the paperback"" list."
1,Worst book in series,"Dear Tor,Please send me a voucher for those hours I lost reading Crossroads of Twilight. I would to have them back please.This is hands down the most boring and tedious book in this series. Even though I have all ten of them in hardback, I stop here and give up on this mess.I encourage you to ...write to the editors letting them know how you feel!"
3,Why does nothing happen?,"I just finished this book, and while I continue to applaud Jordan for writing a rich world and having a wonderfully descriptive writing style, I must admit that I was extremely disappointed. This novel reads as filler for later books and may move the plot the least of any Wheel of Time book so far. I love this series, but I am angry that after waiting over 2 years Jordan spends 680 pages telling the eager reader that almost nothing new has occurred. Maybe I'll wait for book 11 in paperback."
1,Abysmal,"This book is horrid, absolutely horrid.1000 pages and nothing happens. Absolutely nothing happens - never again will I buy one of these.I actually loved the first 4 or 5 books - raved about them to anyone who would listen. Then the next few were weaker with PATH OF DAGGERS being awful. But, this is the bottom of the barrel. Horrid is the only way to describe it.Shame on you Jordan, shame on you..."
1,674 pages of nothing,"I have loved the previous 9 books in this series and would rate them all 5's. This book, however, stinks. NOTHING HAPPENS. Most books have some sort of climax, this has none. I don't know what took him 2 plus years to write this but I hope I won't have to wait another two years to read the next book. I feel as though I wasted my money purchasing this. Do yourself a favor, borrow it from the library, this book isn't worth the paper it is printed on."
2,How repetitive,"This book is true to Robert Jordan's form- slow, plodding and overly detailed. He spends pages describing dresses, of all things! Not a single clothing change goes unnoticed, as each dress, no matter how transitory, gets its embroidery, material, color, feel, protection from the elements, and cleavage showing described.He also fails to move the plot along strictly because of the sheer weight of the 15 or so subplots that don't need a chapter to review. The book lacks focus, and it shows.It wasn't always like this. Jordan's first five books in the series manage to include enough detail to completely flesh out the world without weighing down the action. The previous books had a minimum amount of downtime, but now he writes entire books of downtime.I don't know; I'll give the series one more pass. If Jordan drops the ball again, that's the last straw."
2,3 years for this?,"I can't believe I waited 3 years for this. The book would not have been so dissapointing if the time between editions had only been a year. If I have to wait 2 or 3 years for the next book I may not finish the series, it has proven to not be worth the wait with the last 3 books."
2,The Wheel of Time has stopped turning,"I have only one thing to say to Mr. Jordan and that is ""MOVE IT ALONG, SIR"" because the plodding pace is wearing out my patience. How could you have published this book, when it could have been pared down into the prologue for Book 10 is just unbelievable. If Book 11 is anything like the last 3 books and most especially Crossroads, then I will no longer be reading The Wheel of Time. You will have lost another customer and fan."
1,BIG LETDOWN,"If you need something to put you to sleep, read this book. I don't think it could have been any more boring. I'm outraged that I wasted my money on this !..."
1,Not a Good Choice,Very disappointed. Not what I expected. Certainly not the type of writing of the first 5 books. Time to move on to another series.
1,What Happened,"The firsr five books on the Wheel of Time were proabaly some of the best in the genre. The sixth to this one have been utterly horrible and painful. What in the world happened here. The series went from one of the best in the genre to one of the absolute worst. Now just about anything in the genre is better. These were so bad I don't feel it nessesary to continue this review, my suggestion, read the first five, then quit."
1,In a word..it [...],"Nothing, and I mean absolutly nothing, happened. DO NOT waste your time or money. The Dragon Reborn, yeah you know, the guy who all this is about, has all of about 30 pages out of 700. If you like reading about how women worry about their dresses, nag about other people, or other stuff like that, this book is for you. Otherwise, reread something else. Very disappointed."
2,Is there a point to all this?,"Horrible disappointment. I've been reading this series for 13 years now, and was hoping that with the momentous event at the end of the previous book we'd finally start wrapping this thing up. Nope. The plot advances very little in book 10, there are no big surprises or revelations and the characters are all still in the same predicaments they were in at the end of book 9. I can't imagine what the author was thinking. For the vast majority of the book, we see what everyone else was doing up to the time of the end of book 9, so it's not even advancing chronologically. Still, I will be one of the first in line to buy book 11 because after such a substantial investment in time, money, and enjoyment of the first 8 books, I really want to see how this thing ends. If it ever does."
1,In his own words,"Robert Jordan wrote his review, ""The words popped out of his mouth before they were clear in his head. He realized that they had been lying there for some time, though, murky and slowly solidifying."" (p. 131)"
2,Is this the same author who wrote book 1?,"I don't think that it is the same author who started the series. There was more time spent describing what everyone was wearing than there was advancing the plot! Not a single trolloc, myrdraal, battle, or discovery in the entire book. The only bright spot was the interaction between Tuon and Mat, other than that I'm horribly disappointed. If you are a fan of the series, you will probably read this book, if you have only read the first few, don't expect this to follow in the footsteps of the early part of the series. If Mr. Jordan cares about his fans, he will get back to what brought us all in in the first place; action, plot advancement, new discoveries, and a light at the end of the tunnel."
1,A couple hundred pages of pure drivel...,"This book was pathetic. I slowly managed my way through the 90 pg. prologue, where, of course, we are plagued by new characters or minor characters that don't seem to have any real purpose in the greater scheme of things. And then I start getting into the real book. Nothing happens.Oh well, I shrugged, and continued reading. 400 pgs in. Nothing has happened. Absolutely nothing has happened. Unless you count a two page essay on how to clean silk.As I got closer to the end, I slowed, hoping that -some- action would end the book, that at least -one- plotline would be resolved. But no.Robert Jordan needs to wake up and stop writing what appears to be 650 pg. prologues for the next book. At this rate, the series will -never- end and he'll just continue to reap in the dough. Well not anymore. I, for one, refuse to buy a Wheel of Time book again. Thanks, Jordan, for writing six good books."
2,"Classic Jordan, but just an overlong prologue","Much has already been said about this book, so I'll summarize my point here:There is insufficient plot and character development. Jordan essentially wrote 700 pages of prologue to his next book. Crossroads of Twilight could have set the stage while managing to tie up at least a few of the many loose plot threads in the series. It lacks any real direction or purpose, which makes for an unsatisfying reading experience."
1,I'm DONE with Wheel of Time!,"I was an AVID fan of the first five or six books of the Wheel of Time series, but books seven through ten have really had that ""throwing in the anchor"" feel to them, as Jordan slowed the storytelling pace to a crawl and milks this thing for all it's worth. It's come to the point where I literally cannot finish reading the latest book ""Crossroads of Twilight"". The story is so slow, so tedious in its detail, and so sprawling in the number of characters and political minutia, that I have reached the point where I no longer care. I'm deeply saddened that Jordan has transformed such an initially good and emotionally engaging story into such dry, lifeless tedium. Don't waste your money on this travesty."
1,A Piece of ...,"Folks, let me start off by saying that I loved each of the first 9 books of this series. After finishing each, I couldn't wait for the next one to come out. However, in the last 2 books, Mr. Jordan has taken tens of thousands of words to painstakingly say absolutely nothing. With creations of fiction like this, he should take his talents to the speech writing corps for the Democratic Party. I have wasted [money] and two weeks of my free time reading his last two ""efforts,"" and have in doing so, I have been played for a fool. I'll not be again. I won't spend another dime on his books, and will read the reviews to see if anything actually HAPPENS in the next novels before I borrow them with great trepidation from my local library."
1,Why Mr. Jordan...why???,"Sigh. Yet again...a Wheel of Time book. I remember when my cousin gave me the first book in this now delapidated series. It was so fresh, so vibrant, so interestingly differnt. He was vividly descriptive and even though a fool could've seen that the main character was the Dragon Reborn, it was still fun to see the characters slowly come to that realization themselves. And once they did come to that realization, readers knew they were in for something truly epic...and so they waited for the next book...and the next...and the next...and the next...and the next...and nothing has yet happened. Doing this with two books would have been forgivable, after all, everyone makes mistakes. However, Mr. Jordan refuses to listen to his former readers. This review says exactly what every other review said: boring, redundant, not worth the effort."
1,Disappointment abounds,"I was greatly disappointed in this book. Compared to Book 9, this could have been about Little Orphan Annie.The only action takes place in the first few pages. Nearly 350 pages are taken uup with ""deep"" insights of the three major female characters. There is no conclusion or even a hint of one. The three male heros are left in limbo.I think that Jordan is using The Wheel of Time as his annuity. I expect another ten in the series to keep his royalties coming in."
1,Worthless.,"If this book had never been written, the Wheel of Time series wouldn't change. Nothing happens. Nothing. No major plot developments. No minor plot developments. A whole lot of characterization, and yet, Jordan's characters are all blending into one sort of 'SuperCharacter,' which cannot be stopped. Run away. Flee this mighty evil. Its ceaseless whining and conjecture about things which it knows to be false will only bring doom! Dooooooom!"
2,what might have been,"It is a sad day. After seeing book #11 on the preorder list I decided to check a few reviews of the last book. Which I bought and read as soon as it came out, like I have with all the WOT books. However, reading these reviews brought back the memories of that reading and the 5 before it. And I'm lead to only one conclusion that the Wheel of Time has moved from a slow leak to a shredded truck tire littering the highway. And it's all the more sad since I started reading Jordan way back when with ""Conan the Invincible"". Jordan packed more excitement, fun, and action into a 250 page Conan book then he has into these 10 bloated volumes. And if I hear another 3-page description Egwene's dress, or somebody else's boots and lace cuffs I'll shoot myself. Fortunately for me though I wont. Like many others here I will not buy book 11, 12, 13.....and on and on and on. Until and if Jordan ever finishes this thing, which I'm beginning to doubt. Sad.RIP, Mr Jordan."
3,"When , oh when, will this story end?","The multipal story lines are getting cumbersome. This book was needed just catch up with all the characters and advance the story line just a step closer to that ever dreamed of ""end"".The whole adventure is well worth the time and very enjoyable. It does get bothersome at times. The wait between installments is almost enough to make you lose interest. But not quite."
3,Crossroads of Mediocrity,"In the Crossroads of Twilight the Wheel of Time series continues its transformation from a wonderful fantasy-fiction story with endearing characters to a slow-moving soap-opera. Many of the once endearing characters have by now compromised themselves in so many ways that one wonders if the Wheel of Time world will be better off if they lose (rather than win). Even the morally upright Perrin does something reprehensible while his faithful wife Faile considers an act of unfaithfulness in captivity. However, Jordan is an excellent story-teller and does end the book in such a way as to bring two major threads together and leave the reader in great anticipation of the next installment. Mr. Jordan, in your next installment, please bring back the pace and character integrity that made your first 4-5 novels so endearing."
5,An excellent continuation on the series,"This book is a continuation of the series. It can not be read by itself. Many people will not like it because it and the last few books are not independent novels. He started the series writing the first few so that you could read one of the later books and not miss out on anything, but now each new book is just a collection of additional chapters. Each individual book can therefore not be viewed as a separate novel, but must be read and viewed as an epic saga to be truly appreciated. It might be easier if you wait till they are done to start reading them, but if you are already in the middle then buy this book and enjoy."
1,"I quit around book 6, or was it 7?","These reviews are just amazing. I was looking for something to read tonight, and ended up entertaining myself by reading at least 100 of these reviews. The one-star reviews seemed especially on target.At least, I think they are, since I haven't actually read one of these books since book 6, or was it 7? I just remember starting the last book I tried to read and it spent the first 100 pages with 'the women' bickering about something, and I thought, 'I'm really, really tired of this. I cannot relate to these petty folks.'So, I did myself a BIG favor and STOPPED READING THIS DRECK. And you know what? I haven't missed it one bit. Last thing Mr. Jordan needs is encouragement to write more of this swill.And like so many, I was really disappointed, because the first four books were pretty good. But, the series has become more and more tiresome as each new book is released. No more for me."
1,omoi peplegmai kairian plegen eso,"This book ought to embarrass its author. After dominating the world of epic fantasy for a decade, RJ has either become so megalomanical that his editors can't reason with him or he just plain lost control of his story. _Crossroads_ is the worst installment in an increasingly tired series. If tarmon gaidon doesn't come soon, the world might just collapse under the weigh of all the cardboard charaters and trite phrases that have appeared in the last three books.Perhaps RJ just plans to flog this dead horse until The Wheel comes full circle."
1,"Wake me up when its finished, please.","What else can be said about this horrific book? The sheer amount of paper & ink spent detailing what the characters are wearing is absolutely mind-numbing. When you've got to rely on good reviews from the likes of brown-nosing want-to-be writers who call the general public a bunch of dim-witted bulbs, because they can't appreciate ""good literature"", then you know you're in trouble. No, this is not ""good literature""; it is stupid. And it's a slap in the face to every customer who naively slapped down their hard-earned money for this gargantuan book in the futile hopes that Mr. Jordan has decided to write for us mere mortals again. This book is boring, slow, ponderous, & about as exciting as my college algebra textbook. Please, for the sake of your sanity go pick up something else, anything else!"
1,I must be a complete wool head to have read this far.,"I was one of Jordan's biggest fans through the first 5 books. Great characters, imaginitive premises and satisfying resolutions -but each following book in the series has been less and less enjoyable. This one really takes the cake. Jordan seems to take great pride in introducing a minimum of 17 new characters in each chapter, each one supplied with generous physical descriptions and absolutely nothing more. It is impossible to keep track of , remember or differentiate 178 different Aes Sedai and 220 Sanchean, 44 Two Rivers, 28 Saldeans..well, you get the point. He's lost complete control of this series. I won't read beyond this chapter. Even worse than this is the fact that nothing happens. Nothing!! Rand himself is barely in the storyline. I've never written a review online, but I couldn't wait to burn this one. Do yourself a favor, and start following another writer."
1,Long Past Time To End It,"I have been a fantasy fan for a very long time. I started with Stephen Donaldson, moved on to Terry Brooks and then to Raymond Feist and David Eddings. At one time, Robert Jordan ranked with the best. That time has long since passed. The book is uninteresting and does nothing to move the series along. Jordan fans should skip it so as not to lose whatever love they may have left for the series. Jordan has long since run out of new or interesting things to say, and it is time to end the series. Hopefully he can find a final novel that is worthy of ending what was once a truly outstanding series. I do fear, however, that he has lost interest in what he does and is merely holding on for as many paychecks as he can squeeze out of this."
3,Value?,"The only value in this book, is as a gap-filler. Jordan started well with books 1-5. 6-9 got steadily slower; pace was glacial if that. Book ten is ridiculous. He needs to get off the kick with describing every little detail and get back to the story. One chapter is two thirds filled with Elayne having a bloody bath - just that - nothing else. This book could have been condensed to about 4 or 5 chapters and distributed liberally around the other books.Jordan needs to get a grip, NOW. He's losing fans, and that right fast."
1,Hoping for a turn around.,"I think Jordan did not really start losing it until Book 7. That book was the first time an ending occured with really no big event occuring and no converging of plot threads. Since then things have become worse, with the exception of Book 9 which is OK.But this one takes the cake. So much has been said in the other 2000+ reviews that I will only add: THERE IS NO REASON TO READ THIS BOOK. Because no plot lines advance or characters converge or events happen, a reader will have no problem going from Book 9 to 11.I have hope that Jordan can round out the series with two more books channeling the 1990 Jordan which hooked us all.If that happens it would save the series. And perhaps future editions of the series will conviently omit this book. It would be easy to do and not missed."
4,"Jordan, steadfast but lacking","The ""wheel"" is finally moving. Jordan adds another good chapter to a complex storyline. It is good not excellent. We have all waited two years for this long awaited new chapter in a drawn out saga. Having said that I do believe that the book is a giant leap forward in what has been a dawdling storyline. You begin to believe that the end is drawing near. Mat is as always his usual gambling self, but with the daughter of the nine moons to occupy his time he is not himself. Perrin search for his wife continues and he perhaps loses his innocence in the process. Rand is not mention till the last 3/4 of the book; however, the decisions that he makes will develop the next possible 2 books and keep us coming back for more. It is not The Great Hunt, or The Shadow Rising, but it does keep the storyline moving very good. Read on, for Tarmon Gaidin awaits."
1,Thank you reviewers,I stopped buying the WoT books after Book 7 (which I could not finish) but from your reviews I can tell I missed nothing. Not buying until the last book.
1,Not worth the wait,"I can't believe that it took three years and nearly 700 pages to write this book. The entire storyline of this installment can be summed up into two words ""nothing happened"". I have every book in the wheel of time series and have read them multiple times with great enjoyment. But this last book is just horrible. You keep reading the book waiting and hoping for something to happen and nothing ever does.In the Prologue, the ""Wolf"" is introduced into the story line then never heard from again. Are we to wait three more years to find out what his attack plan against the Seachan is and wether or not it will work?It is almost as if Robert Jordan doesn't know how to end the series and is writing this book to waste time.I recommend that anyone who has not purchased this book wait for the next installment and start from there. You won't miss a beat.Severely dissapointed in Mr. Jordan."
2,Sloooow,"I've been a Jordan fan for years, the first five books hooked me. This book, however, is incredibly slow moving. Get ready for minute details: the color of a random Aes Sedai's dress, the trim of her shawl, the hair color of an unknown Aiel... the list goes on. Plot advancement in almost nil, new characters come and go, never to be heard from again. What's the point? I hope Jordan gets things moving once more; it will probably take him two years to write the next book and my patience is wearing thin."
1,Crossroads of the Never Ending....,"To put it bluntly: ""This book [is bad]!"" 700 pages ... .Let me say, I do love the series and I re-read everything before the release of each book. But book 10 is completely worthless and anyone can skip this whole book and not miss anything. The book spends 500 pages telling you about what other people were doing during events that happened in book 9.Nothing at all was accomplished in this book, no battles, no moves, nothing more or less then people talking to each other. I can't believe I actually spent so long waiting for this book to be released."
1,Absolutely Terrible,"Please do your self a favor and avoid this series like the plague. When I start a series, and I've been inthis genre for years, I finsih it. This is the first one I really wanted to quit. I really beieive the author fills the books with mindless babble just to fill 800 pages and sell something. Book 10 is the worst of a really bad series. Read the dictionary, it has more life."
1,I can't believe it!,Ugh! Book ten of WOT is even worse than book nine!Nothing happens! Doesn't RJ EVER read his readers' feedback? Or has he absconded with his writing fees and TOR is left ghosting for him?The ratings of one star is not earned.
1,Clar in Minnesota,"I have to agree with all the reviewers out there who've decided that this book was a waste of time. I love the first 6 books - but, I've been disappointed, and to be honest, dismayed at the rest of them - especially this one. I don't care what everyone is wearing! Really! I want some action. I can only figure Jordan's getting paid per page, because this book was entirely filler. I really don't see how he can end this series in even 3 additional books. He's got too many characters - that I can only imagine have no actual purpose to the story other than to bide the time before he figures out what he's going to do with the main 20 or so characters. CRAZY!! I've finished the George R.R. Martin series - A Song of Ice and Fire (so far)- that's the series that I'm going to continue to read!"
1,"Finally, some much needed answers...","Finally, after two years, I can sleep again. I finally know what each character (great and small, but mostly small) felt, saw, thought, wore, smelled, ate, etc during the climactic events closing out book nine. I can hardly begin to describe my excitement at reading 5 pages of description about how the Aes Sadai choose there seats at their town hall meeting.Jordan has also introduced a new interesting liturary vehicle, the ""slow down the plot until it actually travels backward in time"" technique. Using this innovative tool, we may finally be able to answer the question that has been plagueing us all since book one... ""how did the forest squirrels feel as they watched Moirain, Rand, et al. leaving the Two Rivers at the start of their epic adventure?"" Of course, given his current pace, we won't hear about it until book 20..."
2,Dying of Thirst,"Being a Wheel of Time fan is like being in a dessert, dying of thirst. When a new book comes out, it's like finding a canteen or an oasis. You pray for water. Even if the water is tepid and salty you savor each drop. Crossroads is a cup of foul brine. Nothing happens! What have I been waiting for. A cliffhanger ending was the last thing this book needed.Three more years for the next book! Please Mr. Jordan, write the books that made me one of your biggest fans. I feel ill. :("
1,Worst of series,"This is by far the worst book in the series. Im finding it very hard to finish. With most WOT books i cant put it down. But this ill read 2-3 pages and struggel to finish those because im soooo bored! I find myself browsing ahead a few chapters to see if Rand or Perrin or Matt will show up to rescue me from this BOREDOM! BUT NOTHING HAS HAPPEND AT ALL IN THIS BOOK! Its extremely slow, basically consisting of people talking, then stairing at the wall in the direction of Rand, then back to talking. Jordan seriously take 3-4 pages to describe the tea Elayne is drinking and why/how she hates it. The book then goes to some characters that i dont care about and have never seen before/do not remember b/c they had some random line in book 2. im like 600 pages in and it has taken me forever and i dont even want to finish it! Then to top everything off really 800 some-od pages for this slow and boring book really?????"
2,This book was pretty much just fill.,"I love this series so read the book, but I have to say that I was quite dissapointed by the time I finished it. It didn't seem to answer any questions or really get anywhere. I was rather unimpressed with it actually. I am a big Robert Jordan fan and have a hard time writing a negative review of this book, but I felt urged to be honest about it. I hope the next one is better. Rest in peace Mr. Jordan."
1,What a Ripoff,"The CoT is a ripoff. As I read it, I wondered when's it going to get good, when's something going to happen? Nothing happened. Come on, kill off these plot lines and lots of these misc characters! Tie things up, already! This book is such a filler and non-story. I like the first six books, but this one was boring, plodding, trivial (did I mention boring?), and who the heck cares anymore about this guy or that gal? MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN, OR FORGET ME AS A FAN!"
1,Is Jordan even trying anymore?,This does it for me. I'll wait for reveiws of book 11 before I buy it. Book 10 continues the dragging style of the last few. Will anything ever happen again in the WOT series? I think not. Pretty much nothing happens to further the greater story arc. It was such a chore to read! Yuck. Terrible! What is happening to Jordan?!?
2,We are not going anywhere!,"Robert Jordan is letting his loyal fans wait again. After eager anticipation of this installment, I am begining to forget my reasons for continuing to follow this saga. Filled with many characters who don't contribute much to the plot, this book provides little change/movement in Rand's struggle. Everyone in the book appears to be waiting with no resolution in sight. The only action is that the dice are still rolling in Mat's head; we see Rand in the last few pages still in pain and static; and Lan is alive! He's mentioned on two pages. This l-o-n-g struggle with the constant threat of war seems not to be worth the time anymore. Will readers really care when the"
1,WOT Fans...Caveat Emptor,"NOVEL. The core meaning of this word means NEW, original, or striking.Jordan's 'latest' left a bad taste in my mouth; I closed the cover of the 'book' feeling ashamed (again)of the $$ outlay dedicated to its purchase. I feel that readers are no better off after reading the book than before reading it in the respect of seeing this saga to its end.In my opinion, nothing [or no where near enough] occurred.And that really is a sad thing. Maybe the 'WOT' [one may insert 'waste' or 'wheel' for the 'W' at your wont]will make that 'Turn' back to respectability and return to the roots of its former greatness as evidenced in the authors first five novels in this epic. we shall see..but definitely not in hardcover...sorry Tor."
1,"waffle, waffle....","after a great start Jordan has got totally bogged down and seems to have forgotten that there is a story to tell here. For the first time in all the books NOT A SINGLE thing of consequence happens. People should ... this book and wait to read the prologue of a future book which could catch the reader up in 100 pages. Robert Jordan, please get off your ... and finish up this series least you be remembered as a writer with great potential who either sold out or lost inspiration and petered into insignificance.Maybe, Im being too harsh. Perhaps all the setup will lead to a thrilling next book that will be available inside 6 months.Nah, who am I kidding the next book will be 2005/6 and I like many, many other readers I will have just moved on."
1,You have got to be kidding me,"Are people still reading this series? I started reading this series when I was about 14 or 15 years old. I am now 27 and was so disgusted with the last one that I took someone's advice in this forum and started the George RR Martin series (excellent series, fufilled the promise of what WOT should have been). I do not see how people can continue to spend on money on a series that is obviously now published only to appease publishers and fans. Would any of you have bought the second book if Eye of the World was anything like Mr. Jordan's last 4 books? Will there be anyone around to find out how this once good story ends?"
1,I'm done.,"So sad. I can vividly remember reading the first few pages of ""The Eye of the World"" for the first time. I was but a teenager, and this book, and the ones that were to follow, would make me far more critical of average fantasy fare. Alas, I am no longer in high school. In fact, I am no longer in college. Come to think of it, I'm pushing THIRTY (!!!!!!) and this story continues to unfold. The tragedy. If this series had been but a moderate success, I am sure that it would have been wrapped up (with a bow) by book six or seven. The author has lost his handle on this story, and on my interest. Though it pains me to declare it, I give up on this series. What a waste."
1,Tedious Sequel,"In writing the tenth volume of the wheel of time epic, Jordan fell well short of expectations. His tendency for excessive descriptions of every character bordered on tedium. Of the nearly 700 pages barely 100 made any contribution to moving the plot along. The remainder covered endless descriptions of characters clothing, mood, hairstyles, accents and continual smoothing of skirts. Even when the stated smoothing was not necessary. This volume was a complete disappointment based on the strengths of previous books in the series."
2,Nothing really happened.,Its part of a huge series that I habe been longing to read for three years. As a fourteen year old I don't get much money and it too me a while to save up fo rhtis book. What a waste. The story took place over the course of a week. Nothing really happened. Oooo Yeah. Matt travels with a circus. Perrin blushes a lot and doesn't shave. I know they say that these last few books ahve been building up for some great finale. If the Last Battle doesn't happen soon I'm not going to buy this series anymore. It took me a month to read just because I couldn't read more than a few chapters without becoming tired.
1,What was I thinking?,"After the last 3 books I should have known better than even think this book would be worth reading much less spending money on. I should have got something more exciting like Plato's Republic. It isn't like I absolutely have to have to have to have a book with lots of action but it should at least hold my interest past the prolouge. The fact that I got through it is a prodigious achievement for me, one which I shall never try again unless I am highly medicated. One star is more than this book deserved."
2,Uninspired,"Like many reviewers here I had been initially angry becasue of the lack of pace in CoT; also, the number of pages which are pure filler, where nothing happens seems to increase with every book in the series and this is kind of annoyingI am not angry anymore. I think that Jordan simply lost his inspiration; both he and his publisher are likely to be desperate by now but what can one do?! Robert is not the first one who has fallen out of graces with the Muse and he is not the last. It is tempting to speculate what closed the channels through which this world we all came to love was taking shape...Oh well, I just hope we learn more about the Aelfinn and the Eelfinn."
1,It's all been said...,No need to go into details as to why I didn't care for this book--plenty of people have voiced my thoughts. I just wanted to add my ranking to others.
1,"No Battles, No Excitement, No Suspense","When I first started reading this series I enjoyed the first books because of the colorful characters, the fighting that went on, and way the characters worked through problems. This book added very little to the plot, very little action, (1 person lost a hand and one was killed), and was in general boring.You could skip this book entirely and not miss a thing from the series."
1,Skip to page 600 before you fall asleep!!,"I struggled through book 9, it was a roaring adventure compared to this one. Honestly, you might as well skip to page 600 and read the last few chapters. All Jordan does is continue to muddy the waters and drag out the story line on what has grown to too many characters. I have heard he plans to write 12 in all. Fortunately, he won't get any more of my money as I intend to wait for my public library to buy the books. All I can say is the next book better ""pump up the volume"" to get us closer to closure."
1,DONT BOTHER READING THIS BOOK NOW,Apparently Jordan has to produce a book every year or so regardless if he has anything written or not .. To satisfyhis publisher he comes up with this book.. A total ripofffor Wheel of Time fans . Abe Lincoln said it took him3 hours to write a 5 minute speech and 5 minutes to write a3 hour speech .I think you can guess my opinion of how many minutes it tookto throw this book together...I guess we will need to wait another year or so until he finishesthis one albeit under another title...
2,Robert Jordan's Crossroads of Twilight,"This is the worst Wheel of Time Novel so far. Robert Jordan opened my eyes to the world of fantasy books with his ""Eye of the World."" It seems that the last few books has showed that the well of his imagination has begun to dry up, but the ink in his pen has not. Like many of the others who have reviewed this book, I find that he blabs on and on about nothing. He doesn't introduce anything new and exciting in this book. His characters, plot, and imagination have stagnated. Like another Amazon.com reviewer, I myself ask, ""Why was this written?"""
2,672 pages of setup - No action.,"This book was incredibly disappointing. This series is going downhill hard. Each of the last few books was a long (sometimes very long) setup followed by an exciting ending. This one is the same except it lacked the exciting ending. In a nutshell, nothing happened. I am eager to see how the series turns out, but Jordan doesn't appear interested in advancing the plot at all. He appears to be writing for the money by seeing how long he can drag the series out. Winter's Heart gave me hope that this series was picking up again. Crossroads of Twilight crushed those hopes."
1,Book 10 - first 300 pages are worthless,The first 300 or so pages of the book are worthless: Endless and useless details that barely touch upon the main story lines (yes story lines) after waiting years to pick up where book 9 left off. I am so disappointed that I will most likely not finish the series. As much as I want to know the ending this is just not worth it!!
4,At last after 2 long years...,"Had been following the Wheel Of Time Series since the first book back in 1990.. One thing about Jordan's writing is that it's all about setting things up.. so that you can imagine what was the situation like and the scenario of the places involves.. One thing that I agree with this book story line is that it tries to cool down from the last book climax on cleansing the saidin.. it's a huge thing.. so we have to know the impact of that to the rest of the world.. If Jordan make it all in a paragraph to let in some new climax stuff.. we wouldn't have know what's in Egwene's mind, what did the Ashaman thinks.. are they afraid with sensing that someone far away are using the one power so much they could sense it thousand of miles away.. It's a good setup for the next scene.. the ending is good.. I never like Egwene anyway.. hahhahahabut thinking about the next book probably came out in another 2 years.. the wait are frustrating.."
1,"This isn't a book, it's a bad fashion show...","Oh brother. I just don't know where to begin. Any plot development in this entire 600+ page book, what little there is of it, could EASILY have fit into one of Jordan's infamously long-winded prologues. Everything else is nothing but tedious, painstakingly long descriptions of what each character is wearing, their facial expressions, Aes Sedai temper tantrums, etc., ad nauseum, ZZZZZ... snore. Wha... oops, sorry, I dozed off there for a moment. What happened, Mr. Jordan, did you have a bunch of airheaded teenage girls ghost-writing this drivel for you?What a shame that such a once-promising series has now become the butt of so many jokes. Mr. Jordan, on the off chance that you might see this, please get a grip, pop a hole in that blimp sized ego of yours, get back to writing books and leave the fashion shows alone."
1,The thing that sucks the MOST...,"Is how much retarded emotional investment has been put into these friggin' characters. Goddamn, i started reading this series when i was 14, and i'm still sitting here at 24 reading this awful mess. Unfortunately, you fall in love with the characters, the world, and the setting, and you can't get all that crap out of your head.And hell, i'm a rational human being! A medical student! Some day i'll be messing with your body, but even then it'll be nowhere near the mindjob that Jordan has crapped all over us. Obviously, we've all got better things to do, but once in a while you just get pissed off that you care about something so utterly stupid.Read this book if you have to. I know i did, but man... what a price to pay."
1,What happened?,"I've been patient. At the end of WH, I thought that my patience was finally going to be rewarded. It ended with something that *should* have been a major turning point. I mean, the Taint is clensed from the male half of the One Power. That's a Big Deal (tm), right? When I read that, I was certain that the next book was going to explode.It fizzled. A bunch of people see Rand's Big Project from a distance and, effectively, go ""huh?"". Meanwhile, everyone is still bogged down in the same plot-lines that they were last time -- and I do mean the *same* ones, and not a single one so much as inches towards resolution.After such an enormously portentious ending in WH, it's simply incomprehensible to me that Jordan would have chosen to spend yet more time twiddling with all the pieces he has on the board.What happened? A big, fat nothing."
1,Don't bother,"I was the most avid fan Robert Jordan could hope for, but this book, like several before, leaves me saying ""what's the point?"". No element of the plot is advanced, no battles to speak of (his strong point), and no reason to finish the book. I'm waiting until this series is over (assuming it will be), then reading the reviews, then making a decision. If the writing doesn't return to the original story, SHOCK, story, I'm done.As of now, there's better out there. Prove your worth, Robert Jordan, right now, I have no desire to support your writing."
1,"Yadda, Yadda, Yadda","I agree with all the others who have stated that everything important that happened in this book could be summarized in one concise paragraph.I think Jordan has collapsed under the weight of the mass of characters and plotlines he has created. I was hoping by some Herculean effort, he could resolve something in this book, move forward, bring something to a head. I was wrong."
3,thank heavens I read the reviews first,"I spent a very enjoyable hour+ reading the reviews of this book posted on Amazon. It amazes me how creative some readers are (and makes me a little bit envious). Because of reading these reviews, I read this book with the lowest of expectations, expecting pages upon pages of tea-sipping rituals, braid pulling, and much sniffing. Instead, it wasn't a bad book, given the low expectations with which I started. However, don't be fooled - this is nowhere near as good as the first four books in the series.I recently finished this book after reading the first 75 pages when it first came out. I was so disgusted with starting with even more new characters that I had no clue who they were that I put it down for some time, until I heard that the new book was second to last. I think only that would have made me pick up this series again. Sad -- I loved this series originally. I'm 100 pages into the newest installment, keeping my high hopes that all will be resolved."
2,Caught in a spiders web,"Hell, this is getting to be a drag. However the first 6 books in the series have set the story and I need to know how it will end. The last four books seem to be more of a money making venture and Jordan and his pubs are trying to milk the series for what its worth.For those you who are already in the series, well read it to continue the series not worth a buy"
1,"Pure, hot garbage",This once great series has become utter garbage. There's really nothing else to say.
2,SKIP IT!,"While I love the series, this book is an absolute waste of time and money. Save your money for a series where something is actually happening and you don't finish several hours worth of reading feeling like you just got ripped off. Anyone who read Winter's Heart will have no trouble with Book 10...assuming it actually has a plot."
2,I hate to be negative but...,"I am a WOT fan. I have enjoyed this series, even through a couple of less...enjoyable...books. However, I am afraid I have to join my voice to all the others who have bashed this instance of the series. .... Pure and simple.First of all, the first 300 pages should have been in the previous book. I don't mind a flashback to the previous book in the prologue (like those experienced in previous books) but 300 pages worth of it? Get serious.Halfway through the book, we finally start reading material that would fit into the new book and, aside from some mediocre advances in the Matt/Perrin plots, nothing.Don't get me wrong. The writing is still top notch but the plot just does not cut it.Tor and Jordan better not make us wait another two years for the new book. If they do, Tor is better start looking for a new editor."
1,Warm Milk,"This book, while often read regardless of its quality because it is part of an involved series, is not worth the time of day. Reading this book is truly unnecessary. There are a grand total of 2 things that happen in this book that are necessary to know, and those can be gleaned by asking a friend or reading a plot summary, as each can be summarily noted in a sentence or less."
1,Twilight itself is more exciting!,"I am so disappointed! I have followed this series since the very beginning and have waited patiently on each new volume. In the last few I began to become worried, the pace had started to slow, and the waiting in between each new volume had become almost painful, but at least they all had built to a climax and something had happened in the end .In Crossroads, nothing happened , nothing ! I just finished it and I am stunned and , and ........ I am at a lost for words .Mr. Jordan I think you are amazing but this book is very disappointing!"
1,Disappointing,"Really disappointing but not surprising. At the end of the book, the characters are all exactly where they were when the book started. Nothing really happened. No loose ends were tied up. Plenty of forgettable characters were introduced though (among a cast of thousands of others that are already too hard to keep up with).I expected this book to not carry the storyline a tremendous distance. I was disappointed it didn't carry it AT ALL. I'll never buy another Jordan book even if the next one was the grande finale. It's really a shame, the series started off extremely strong and it's clearly a world that would support multiple series either before, after or during the existing storyline. There's simply no excuse to keep dragging it on like this except to just milk the cash machine."
2,Disappointing,"After one of the most exciting chapters in the entire series at the end of Winter's Heart, I was excited to get this book. Alas I was disappointed in the slow pace and waste of 600 pages that ensued. Rand cleanses Saidin but the book starts before he does and half the book goes by during the cleansing. Just wasteful. What I'm really galled about is the 2 year wait before buying this drivel. If he wants to keep his fans he should consider stepping up the pace and moving on to other things!!"
2,Slogging through the crossroads,"I enjoy Jordan's characters, and appreciate time spent with all the major characters, including Rand, Perrin, Mat, Egwene, Elayne, and Aviendha. However, characterization is only good up to a point; after that, action becomes imperative. Jordan seems to have missed this point. The first time he wrote a book where nothing happened, I said I wouldn't buy any more if it happened again. After reading Crossroads and seeing absolutely nothing resolved, I have finally given up on the series. I may read the rest after he finishes the series, assuming he ever actually does, but until then I'm not wasting my money."
1,Has RJ run out of ideas?,"Loved most of the books in the series to this point. ""The Dragon Reborn"" definitely ranks as one of my most enjoyable reads in any genre. That makes ""Crossroads of Twilight"" all the more disappointing. The plot failed to advance, the characters failed to develop and, frankly, this book was boring.After this stinker, I'm not willing to gamble [money]+ on another WOT book; I plan on picking up the next WOT installment from the library."
1,Where is the plot?,"Another reviewer summed it up pretty nicely: Robert Jordan must be paid by the word. There's no other explanation for this book. The story simply does not develop from Winter's Heart. The progress of the story could be summed up in one to two rather short sentences, at most. Robert Jordan has always inserted lengthy descriptions of various persons, landscapes or whatever, but in the previous books I didn't mind because there was also something going on. I guess the pain that other reviewers felt during reading Crossroads really comes from lengthy descriptions without anything really happening. It's simply boring! Nevertheless, I am waiting for the next book in the hope of something new."
1,I'm a complete idiot!,"That's it, I'm done with this series!!I can't believe that I've wasted hours and hours of my time reading this crap. The series started out great, then went downhill. I made it to book 10, and that's where it ends.This book is page after page of the most trivial detail... nothing actually happens. If I hear another phrase about 'spiced wine' or 'honeyed tea', I'm going to scream! Not to mention the childish little girls that apparently rule the world... trying to tame the evil men (that are good for nothing but breeding).I think Jordan has gone over the edge and lost his mind. I just wish I could tell him to his face. Then again, I did read 10 (9 1/2 actually) of his books, so it looks like he got the last laugh!"
1,CRAP CRAP CRAP,"I swore I wouldn't read this...at least I didn't buy it. I have, in hardcover, books 1 through 9. I may...MAY...purchase book 10 (in hardcover) if it is on sale...for about $5. Not much more than that, and only so I can keep my collection intact.This book is garbage. Nothing...I mean NOTHING at all happens in it. Can you imagine writing a 700 page book and have NOTHING happen.Oh wait...sorry. There are some earth-shattering things that do happen: some women tug at their braids and chuck stuff at guys. Some guys looked all confused when women chuck stuff a them and tug their braids (the women tugging their braids, not the men, 'natch). Oh, and there is a wonderful continuation of the whole, massive, everyone-misinterprets-what-everyone-else-is-doing plout...um...thingie. Sort of like an epic Three's Company episode if, you know, the chicks had braids they kept tugging and they threw stuff at Jack.TOR needs better editors. Or at least ones with the guts to tell an author to forget it."
1,Voltaire said it best,"""The best way to become boring is to say everything.""Jordan needs to take Voltaire's words to heart.I have also seen it translated as, ""If you want to be boring, leave nothing out."" Jordan has left nothing out of this book except for plot advancement, but I am now more familiar with what clothing is in fashion in every one of Jordan's mythological kingdoms. It is greatly disturbing to see such a wonderful epic dissolve into nothingness. What a dissapointment. And now to add insult to injury, it appears Jordan is working on ""Prequel"" novels so the chances of him finishing this series in the next 10 years is pretty slim. Hopefully with all the incredibly bad reviews TOR will kick his butt, actually read his next book before they release it, and compel him to advance the story line. Little hope of that though."
1,"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzwhat, what","Where are the editors? Someone has to stand up to RJ and tell him he can't write 600 pages of exposition and 100 pages of story. I'm being generous in giving him 100 pages of story. I want to scream that I don't care what the snow looks like, that you shouldn't take ten pages to describe nothing happening and what people think about nothing happening. It's like he writes and thinks that it is all gold, that nothing should be cut. I found simple errors in the text that make me wonder if an editor even read it. I started to get mad and actually counted how many pages it would take for the simplest thing to happen, 700."
1,Fool of a twit,"I was amazed to see another review mention the possibility of a book signing tour by Jordan (not that one was happening, but that he would be on the lookout to give Jordan ""an earful"" about the slow pace of the books). I thought everyone had realized that Jordan passed on after the fourth novel, and the publishers obtained a roomfull of monkeys to write the next nine books. Time for a new joke"
4,Better Than Crown Of Swords,"RJ does it again like in Winters Heart, RJ does a lot tighter script. RJ has made the plot bigger with the fact of Rand cleansing saiden the male's half of the one power. Egwene faces the danger of betrayers (likely Forsaken) and a male is using the one power to kill Aes Sedai. Who can she trust? Mat is on the run with the daughter of the nine moons (the one he's destined to marry). And Perrin is still in pursuit of the Shaido. And Mazrim Taim is not to be trusted.A great book and I can't wait till the next one."
5,Against the grain,"I think the Wheel of Time series is excellent, all the way to the tenth book. Alot of people have said it has dragged on too long and he should end it, but I do not think so. Whether he writes one more book, or fifteen more books, I will read every one of them to the very end. I love this series and will actually be very sad to see it end."
3,Do yourself a favor,Love reading phantasy novels? Do yourself a favor and read Steven Erikson's Malazan series. Gardens of the Moon is now available in the U.S. Or you an order the entire series from Amazon.co.uk
2,On the other Hand,"although the pace may be unbearable, and the progress minimal at best, im sure in reality most readers would be disappointed if the series came to a quick end. 10 books worth of setup, to be finished in a single installment? how would anyone (particularly the Master of Description himself) manage to tie up every loose plot end in one novel? it would be carelessly written, and not entirely thought out. However, having spoken with Jordan, I am aware that it is not his lack of vision of an end that keeps him from ending it.( he knew how it was going to end while writing Eye of the World) It is his numerous new plots and loose ends that he keeps creating that are stopping him. With so many, it becomes more complex to end a novel, as well as to produce a new installment(hence the long waits in between releases.) at any rate, enough of this rambling...A slow novel yes...a reason to lose faith in an excellent writer? never"
3,aren't we all,"it's the 10th and complains been pouring since number 4. i bet, though, that readers who appreciate the series far outnumber those ""intellectuals"" who give their 'literary insight' of what the book should/ought to be. personnaly i pick the book to have a good time for myself, relax and enjoy the read.i've always wondered how other people can sit through a soap opera with its dragging plot. but it doesn't take an 'intellect' to figure that these people do find something entertaining clinging to see what happens next in their chosen series. and i guess that's the key, entertainment. i don't like soaps, but then i don't watch it and i leave those who do be. so people, if you don't like what's going on in the WOT, then just drop it and pick one of Kafka, Tagore and the likes instead.as for the rest of us 'fans', well ... the _h__l_ with them intellects."
1,Get On With It Already!,"Does anyone even remember the original plot of these books anymore? I am three hundred pages into ""Crossroads of Twilight"" and I'm realizing that nothing is going to happen in this book either, aside from someone glaring at someone else, or, for a change of pace, someone staring daggers at someone else.If you are looking to buy this book, you have probably already been hooked into the series by the first few books. If so, then it's probably too late to tell you to wait until this series is finished then buy the first several books and the very last one.I'm getting really annoyed with myself for purchasing the last four books in this waste-of-bookshelf-space series."
1,Uggh!,"This book is absolutely the worst I have ever read. You might as well make the ""cha-ching"" sound with page you turn, because all Jordan is doing now is cashing his royalty checks. He ought to be embarrassed about allowing this book to be published. I know I was embarrassed for him when I read it (at least, when I read as much as I could stand).If you do insist on reading this book for some reason, do yourself a favor and just read the first sentence of each paragraph. You will still get the whole ""story,"" but you will spare yourself from reading massive amounts of pointless detail.Uggh!"
2,"As usual, a slow paced book","A turtle, swimming in a sea of peanut butter, would be faster than this.This has got to be the slowest Robert Jordan book ever. I can't believe why there is the need to describe one scene using two to three (sometimes more) pages. Probably, if you took out all the unnecessary details, you'd be left with about 200 to 300 pages, or even less, and still get the same idea. The only thing that makes me continue reading this series is that I've already read Books 1-9 which, for the most part, I enjoyed. I hope his style changes in Book 11, although I'll most certainly read that also whatever happens, if only just to finish the series (coz the storyline is really good)."
1,Crossroads of Twilight,"Ok Mr Jordan the first four book were some of the best i've read. They went steedly down hill from there. I don't want to hear about how she is dressed or how she pulls her braid. Moves way to slow, too many folk to keep track of and might i add just plain boreing. I might buy the last book just to see what happens but you have lost me with this sieres."
2,This time I agree ... this one IS disappointing.,"Many of my friends said that book 8 and 9 of this otherwise excellent serie were boring, in which I totally disagree, but this volume is utterly disappointing - nothing happens, and after 600 pages leading towards a final conclusion, it just ends! - without any conclusion ..."
1,Listen up RJ,"This book should have been the 20 page prologue to the real book 10. For that matter, the last three or four books could and should be collapsed into one volume. I'm willing to grant Jordan amnesty and buy the book if he does this. As it is he's clearly losing control of the series. ..."
2,"Retitle it: ""Wheel of Time: Manual of Fashions and Tantrums""","You know the best way to read these last few books - start off by reading a page at the beginning of each chapter to get your bearings and then skim as soon as the word ""dress""(or any mention of clothing) comes up or a when a character gets flustered - after an average of about 5 pages and then start to read again. That's when the next minor thing will happen - like Perrin will take a second step.Cause the book really reads like this - Egwene looks at Tar Valon, puts on foot over the sadle, then notices Nynaeve is wearing.. [insert five pages on fashion and temper tantrums]...Egwene settles herself in the saddle.I'm only really reading still because he was so damn good at pacing and story in the 4th book. What happened?"
1,"Waste of Time (money, energy, etc.)","Blood and bloody ashes! What a flaming pile of ...... Anyone who's reading these reviews should see that they needn't purchase this book. 700 pages of monotonous drivel about character's clothing and other assorted useless information. Lemme save you the trouble: Perrin still trying to rescue his wife, Mat still trying to escape Ebou Dar, Elayne still trying to gain the throne, Egwene still at a stalemate with the White Tower, oh, and 1 chapter devoted to the Dragon Reborn. The Last Battle now re-scheduled for 2036."
1,The Biggest Book About Nothing!,"This book is so big and doesn't say anything. A person could easily not read this and not miss a beat in the series. The publisher didn't even proof read it. There are so many errors in it; I can't believe it was published. Robert Jordan would have to take knee in the presence of J.R.R. Tolkien. Jordan is a mere Novice, not even an Accepted."
1,A Sorry (p)Lot,"This installment of the Wheel of Time will be the last I have read of this series. It cannot be salvaged anymore in my opinion. Jordan has lost his ability to write as good as he did in the first 6 installments. His disintegration started with a Crown of Swords and has reached an all time low in Crossroads of Twilight. Fans who write 5 star reviews on this installment must do so because they simply cannot phatom that Jordan lost it. Admitting that will wreck their world. But it is already wrecked and nothing they say will change that. To all of them: Wake up and smell the coffee. After all the fantasy, welcome to the real world."
1,"Slow, Slow, Slow!","Like everyone else, I was hoping the story was actually gonna go somewhere with this book.After two years and countless other books in-between, I found it very difficult to remember (or even care about) the endless non-main characters.Flip, flip, flip...no Rand. Flip, flip, flip...still no Rand. Flip, flip - oh wait, here's Egwene...flip - gone!Yes, yes men are woolheads and women are to be feared - I got that six books ago.Now how about some plot?"
1,RJ is George Lucas,"Does anyone else see striking similarities between the recent ""novels"" put out by RJ and the recent ""movies"" put out by George Lucas? Both of them appear to be happily languishing in their piles of money while laughing at the buying public which continues to purchase their pointless melodramatic duds.It's as though the two of them got together and said ""Want to have a contest to see just how bad a piece of media we can create and yet still have millions pay for it?"" I think the most scathing (and heartfelt) thing I can say about this book that has not already been said is that it is WORSE than Attack of the Clowns."
1,Share the blame with the editor and the publisher (TOR),"I can't do any better than the others before me sharing my disgust with Robert Jordan's lack of respect for once-loyal readers. So instead I'll express my lack of confidence in TOR and its editorial staff. If they can let an author of Jordan's talent submit such a piece of drivel,then how can I trust that they will do any better a job with less talented authors? ....An editor can do so much to improve a book but the best thing he or she can do is be honest with the author and not publish something like this.Tor, you're taking a hit on this one. Booksellers, reduce your inventory."
1,Waste of money,"This book was a waste of money plain and simple. Only about one-third of it covered the the main characters. I believe that when you are at the TENTH book of a series you don't really need to bring in about a hundred new charecters. Jordan should have focused this book on Matt, Perrin, and Rand. Once the series is done you can tell us what Egwene, Elayne, the Black Tower, the White Tower, the Senchean and all the other ... were doing. I think there was only two chapters out of 700 pages about Rand. That was just sad. Loyal Wheel of Time readers that don't have the hardcover yet save your money and wait the 3 years untill this one comes out on paperback."
1,An all time low,"Crossroads of Twilight completes a death spiral that has plagued the last few Wheel of Time books. There is no central plot at all, and most of the attention is given to Faile, Perrin, and Elayne, who, as always, DO NOTHING. Plenty of company here, 'cause NO ONE ELSE DOES ANYTHING EITHER. Half of the book takes place before/during the Cleansing, anyway. Zzzzzzzz... Don't waste your money buying the hardback. Borrow it from a friend or a library, or if you're a die hard fan you can wait for the paperback. Idea: Just skip it. You can easily find a summary paragraph that will tell you everything you need to know. Zzzzzzzzz..."
1,Poor,"This book is a disappointment. Almost nothing of substance happensand the reader is constantly frustrated by inane dialoge and drawnout descriptions of minor events and places. I love the Wheel of Time series, however, this book is weak. Very weak."
1,One to forget,"You can skip this one, nothing happins in this book. If you read the jacket, you wil have read the whole book."
1,Excruciating,I just finished reading this book and I am pleased that so many others hated it as much as I did. I found myself skimming the pages in hopes of finding something interesting. There is no way one can keep track of all the new characters being introduced and so little happens to those you once cared about. I will not buy anymore books in this series. How can anyone write 10 volumes of this size and not complete a story?
1,Worst Book EVER,"All I can say is awful, truly awful. This book has to be the biggest waist of paper ever. Not a single thing happens in this book."
1,Total and utter TRASH,"[name], I want my money back. ... This book is terrible terrible terrible.Go look at the people who gave the book 4 or 5 stars, SOME SAID THEY HAVEN'T EVEN READ IT YET! the rest admit it has serious problems. Hello! if a book as serious problems but is still pretty good it should get a 3 NOT A 4 OR 5!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,GET ON WITH IT!!!!,"I bought the entire set of books on tape 1 - 10 thinking book 10 had to be the end because Jordan then worte a ""prequel"". Most writers wait until they have finished the story to write a prequel, so I thought I would have the whole story.Imagine my suprise when I found out not only is 10 not the last book, but 2 more are planned to finish the story and another prequel is on its way.Most of the books have held my attention. CoT didn't get interesting until half way through.The story over all is a good one, but there is just too much filler. In my opinion, this is a series that could have been finished in six books or less."
1,Crossroads of Twilight- Waste of Time,"I have to agree that this book is a big waste of time. It should become the classical example of the word ""filler"". This unfortunatly makes me think that the author is just in it for the money. I liked the story line so far but always found the constant descriptions of how much lace and embroidery was on the ""bodice"" of dozens of dresses a bit much. Crossroads of Twilight is a whole book of this sort of thing but with no real story line development. What a fool I was to buy this in hardcover. Wait until this hardcover is on the bargain books table. It shouldn't be long now."
1,ROBOT Jordan vs. The Sims,"After reading this lackluster installment of what was once my favorite fantasy series. I think that the rumours are true about the author's self destructive life style. He has obviously lost a large number of neural pathways and has burned out his brain.This book was written by ROBOT Jordan. He is obviously on cruise control and living in some kind of artificial simulated reality where writing is a program and text is reproduced according to alogrithm. I think TOR needs to step in and have a real live author help pull his strings for him.. Kind of like what Geppeto did for Pinnochio. Better yet bring in a faith healer or an exorcist. All I know is that Jordan is going to need some major mojo or voodoo to re-animate his ""cold dead hands""....Hopefully it will happen soon or else all we'll be left with is a pile of dust and a test pattern...."
2,The Wheel hits a nail and deflates completely,"Well, my fellow WoT fans, this is the book we all feared would come--a book where Jordan stooped to filling pages with virtually meaningless content, knowing that we would still read it. It is hard to believe how inferior this book is to the others in the series. I am still amazed that my eyes passed over so many words, yet so little happened to advance the story. There are only a few things of remote importance that happen in this book. I recommend that you spare yourself the agony and read an online plot summary instead. But if your curiosity demands that you read it, just be warned--this book is a chore to finish and there is little reward awaiting those who invest the time."
1,Crossroads of Twilight,"Crossroads of Twilight was extremely dissapointing, as were the last few books of the Wheel of Time series. It is as though the series is being dragged out for the purpose of selling more books to the thousands of hooked readers- like myself. I would be overjoyed if Robert Jordan would decide to go somewhere in his next book instead of the state of limbo things seem to be currently in."
1,Jordan cures insomnia,"I absolutely loved the early books in this series, and have read them again and again. Through seven books Jordan delivered a sweeping story filled with action, excitement and suspense. I don't know what happened after that, but the series has deteriorated ever since. This book is so slow moving that by its end no one in the book except those involved even know about the climactic events of the previous book. More minor plots are begun, with none of the previous ones closed. None of the major plots moves forward. None of the major characters does, says or experiences anything particularly interesting. There is no action, and no suspense. After following this series for ten books and some 6,000 - 7,000 pages, I'm dropping out. Somewhere out there are writers who care enough about their readers to tell a good story. I'm going to stop wasting time on Jordan and go find them."
1,and miles to go before I sleep,"Lets cover the obvious points quickly. First, this is indeed a masterfully detailed chapter in a massive saga. Second, this book will not silence the critics of the pacing of the last three to four installments because it just crawls. Third, if you have ever read another massive fantasy saga (such as the Amber novels) you realize that there is a difference between pacing and sheer ponderousness (which this book suffers from). Fourth, those of us who embarked upon this saga are doomed to purchase every remaining book (whose timelines have now been reduced to the same passage of time as it takes the average reader to read this book), but if you have not spent a mini fortune on the Wheel of Time saga yet, for pity's sake go buy George Martin's Song of Fire and Ice saga instead. I can only pray that the remaining time it will take for Robert Jordan to complete this excuciating task will not exceed my lifetime or his."
2,Did anything happen?,"Don't waste your time, read the wikipedia article and move on. The entire book can be summed up in one page and you will not miss anything. However - if you are curious about weevils, bad tea and dress patterns, this may be the book for you."
1,Found myself skipping paragraphs,"I spent forever slogging through this horrible piece of work. Toward the end I found that I was scanning the page for dialog and skipping any paragraphs that had none. I'm pretty sure I didn't miss anything. I'm pretty sure I could have skipped this book altogether and gone on to book 11 without skipping a beat, and I wish I would have!"
2,Crossroads of Twilight and Twilight of a loooong series,"I eagerly anticipated the release of Robert Jordan's latest in the Wheel of Time series. I could not wait for paper back, so purchased the hard cover. Half way through this 700 page epic, I realized that there had been no Trollocs, no Myrddraal, no Draghkar, and believe it or not BARELY any Rand al'Thor!Jordan did an exquisite job of documenting prattling Aes Sedai fiddling with their dresses and welding Saidar to heat their tea, but that is hardly the hallmark of this series. By the all too long end of the book, there were no plot lines resolved from books seven or eight or nine, and only weakly discernible plot lines established for book 11. While confused, I remain resolute!I will pick up books 11 through 15 at a yard sale in 2008. I would think by then the good guys have Tar Valon, the Dark One has a black eye, and Trollocs are sent to live with the Seanchan.I know the next Age takes quite a while to get here, but this is ridiculous!"
1,Where's Rand???,"Where's Rand??? Almost 700 pages and Rand is only on 17 of them. Jordan has abandoned the story and did not resolve a single issue. Unless, it's that Aes Sedai need to be frequently birched.This book is a MAJOR disappointment and is so filled with grammatical and typographical errors that it's distracting.Mr. Jordan, please go back to true storytelling and editors, do your job. Otherwise, this is a cash cow that may be sent out to pasture."
2,It just keeps going on and on and on...,"In ""Crossroads of Twilight"", Robert Jordan firmly establishes the Wheel of Time series as the ""Days of Our Lives"" of speculative fiction. All of the cliches are there - the meaningful stares, the obsession with trivialities, the constant repetition, even the resurrection of departed characters.In the 700 pages of this, the tenth novel in the series, the author has watered down enough plot development to sustain perhaps one or two chapters by a more economical writer.Jordan claims that he has known how the series will end from the very first instalment.I wish he'd let us in on the secret before he takes it to his grave."
1,A big disppointment,"I have purchased and read all the books in The Wheel of Time series , so far (books 1-9), over the past 6 years. After being disappointed with the last installment, I decided to wait, read the copy from the local library, and then decide if I want to purchase the book. I am glad I went this route. This book is once again a disappointment for me. In keeping with the trend introduced in the last book, there are now too many characters, the plot is too wide and the story line has slowed to a crawl. The series should of stopped about 2 books ago, but I think the publishers and author are making too much money off of what they have, so they are trying to strech it out. This is most unfortunate since this has ruined the series."
2,"for the most part, a major letdown","While it is interesting to see the details of the characters fleshed out, it is time for things to start happening. I can only pray the next book is a lot of action because this was rather made me irritated with the author. Especially given the slow movement of the last books.It seems like alot of interesting storylines just dissapear and so much goes unexplained that he starts in the first place."
3,It's time to wrap up the show...............................,"Jordan really had something...a vision, a storytelling ability unrivaled by most neo-fantasy authors, and a winning story line. Something has left the equation, not only in this book, but in the last four. Characters have been altered so much they don't even remotely resemble what we saw in the earlier volumes, the characters we all cared about and found so interesting (Matt is probably the biggest let down to-date). Before the entire series loses all that held it together, it is time to end it. I, like many others, will buy any new installments, not out of a dire curiousity and intense lust (such as with anticipated books from George RR Martin), but rather as a need to put to rest an epic size series that has cost us hundreds of dollars and hours of reading time. Enough setting, let's see some action! This book is must for fans of the Wheel of Time series, but isn't a lure to bring in new readers."
3,Whatever,It was a pretty good book but it didn't really have that much content just a little bit of a info compared to the others.
1,I'm Convinced--the series now stinks,"Yes, the book is a disgraceful mess. Authors are notoriously self-indulgent at times, but Jordan really seems to have gone off the deep end here. His publisher must be terrified that everyone will catch on (the plot has become ""let's make more money and string the readers along as long as possible"") and bail out. Fortunately, [others] seem to realize, all too well, that the fix is on and this book is an insult to all of the WoT's faithful fans. That so many reviews have misspellings and grammical errors shows to me that they were written in a grip of angry passion about the book's myriad shortcomings and Jordan's inexcusable money-grubbing. Give it up, readers!..."
1,I give up. I will never read a WOT book again,"No amount of words can be used to express how dissappointed I am by this book. Just when I though that the series is taking a turn for the better after Winter's heart, out comes the worst book in the series. That's right, this book actually could have a slower pace than BK 7 or Bk 8! Pages and pages are spent on filler descriptions, ...cliches .... it's incredible how Jordan could have written these 700+ pages of junk!...even after reading COT I still feel that the earlier books of the series are a phenomenal work of art.Don't buy this book...."
1,From Fantasy to Soap Opera Writer,"Well, quite frankly, I am at a loss for words. I can't stop wondering what happened to the writer of the first four books. Generally I am not pessimistic, but I think this series is done. RJ had his chance to redeem himself after the book eight disappointment but really blew it on this one. Would be readers who are looking for a good story should look elsewhere; this is no fantasy story, it is pure soap opera. RJ has taken ""Days of Our Lives"" and converted it to RandLand.NOTHING happened in this book but conversation between unknown characters and far flung plotlines. I think the story has taken a life of its own, and RJ is not in control anymore. I am shocked that TOR let this book get out to the press. Nothing important happened in this book that could not have been written in one chapter.I shall repeat, 680 pages of diologue... if I wanted 680 pages of worthless dialogue I could have turned on CSPAN."
1,Previously on 'The Wheel of Time',"It's very disheartening that Robert Jordan has become so successful that he has ceased to beedited. In this latest installment, we spend several hundred pages reviewing where the each of the multitude of characters was at the end of Book 9,and are rewarded with 20 pages of new action. It feels like watching a tv show where you get 48 minutes of Previously on 'The Wheel of Time', and 2 minutes of new show. On the liner notes, Robert Jordan says he's going to write until they nail shut his coffin. Obviously we'll have to wait that long for him to wrap this up. It's sad for a series that had such brilliance."
1,Disappointed,"There was a time when I would buy Robert Jordan's books and spend the next 2-3 days reading them without putting them down. This is not the case with his latest installment. I thought he was finally starting to get things together in Book 9 when something started happening and plot lines started converging on themselves. In Book 10 he is back to writing long winded descriptions about everything with very little happening.Sadly it has taken me over 2 weeks to get through two thirds of this book. Even worse, in the 500 pages I have read, the storyline has only advanced 3 or 4 days. At this rate we will all be dead before the novel has ended."
2,Please end it.,"I have loved almost all Jordan's books, but as time goes on and the story stretches on and on, it has become painful to read. Yes he is a great story teller, but this story should have been over two books ago. Usually there is something that resembles action, but in this book it was as dry as the Sahara during a dry spell. If you have read all of the books so far as I have, you will want to read this just to keep it going. The next book I will wait until it gets to paperback, because this one sure wasn't worth the money for a hardback."
2,Worth Skimming Only,"I join those who have been extremely disappointed by this book. It is another long set-up with not much happening. I give it more than one star mainly because of the scenes with Mat and Tuon, which remind you of the good parts of this over-extended series. The author clearly is not going to listen to those asking for some common sense editing and tightening. Of course, he can do whatever he wants and he's making a bundle of money. But it's frustrating. My suggestion is to wait for the paperback or borrow the hardcover, and then skim it for the scenes involving Mat,Tuon, Rand and Elayne. There is a lot in the book about Egwene, but it doesn't go anywhere and is not interesting. Nynaeve is hardly mentioned, and nothing significant happens with Perrin either. Too bad."
2,No action. No progress. Very disappointing,"I have eagerly anticipated the release of this book and the opportunity to touch base with the characters and story line that I have been hooked on for years in the hopes that Mr. Jordan would take us back to the heart of the main story and get away from the trends of his recent volumes. However, I read the entire book only to find that NOTHING HAPPENS! This latest edition seems to revolve around the characters reacting to one another with none of the action or provocative events so richly portrayed in the earlier books. The story has lost all focus with new characters and situations begin introduced with no resolutions being offered to the ones that we have been so patiently following. There was a time I would have put Robert Jordan just below Tolkien, with Goodkind and the rest just copy cats of their style, but the last two efforts in the Wheel of Time are making me long for a new Sword of Truth release!"
2,Sadly disappointing,"I really have been in love with this series ever since I picked up Eye of the World at a friend's recommendation and hungrily consumed the next 8 books. I was never disappointed until now. This book is one big prologue to I don't know what. Absolutely nothing happens in it. There are no surprises. It's basically all rehash of things we've already read and already know about. In fact most of the individual prologues (Mat, Faline, Perrin, Egwene, etc.) All take place before the end of the last book.Of course I will buy the next book when it comes out, but if it is disappointing as this one, I'll have to drop the series. In the meantime I'm looking forward to George R.R. Martin's next isntallment in the Songs of Ice and Fire series which so far has not been a disappointment and has far surpassed Jordan in keeping me spellbound and turning the pages."
1,there is no -5 star rating unfortuanately,"Poorly written, poorly edited, full of inconsistencies with previous books. Story moves nowhere (in fact, once again it moves back in time from the previous book), and there endless cliched descriptions repeated from earlier books (braid tugging, cool eyed looks, ageless faces, smoothing dresses etc).How many times do we have to have the *same* explanations for the way characters behave and dress? By book 10, we know it. But then, perhaps he is assuming that people who keep buying this series are obviously stupid and can't retain this information.Jordan is milking this series for all it is worth. Quite frankly, this isn't worth the money you are paying for it. If you must read it - despite all the warning reviews - then borrow it from a library. As for me, I'm not giving him another cent."
1,Good Series Gone Bad,"I can only assume that Greed is what has inspired lackluster writing and an un-moving plotline. Yeah ... I can see the setup just like everyone else, but this is just stupid.Also, this is the second book in a row which has a dustcover that contians lies ... nowhere does Perrin risk his soul for Faile. hmmm ... I seem to remember that being in the dustcover of book 9 too. Maybe the last battle is really between pissed off fans and a writer who seems to have lost his touch.Despite its shortcomings I must say that Crossroads did top Winters Heart for WORST BOOK YET and I think we can continue to count on Jordan milking his once loyal fans until no-one cares how the series ends ...A true disappointment."
1,Unquestionably his worst attempt,"This book plods along and goes nowhere. I finished it only because I could not believe how Jordan could screw up a great story so badly. After reading the great books (1-5), this is like watching a senior tour golfer shoot 90 from the ladies tees. There are now thousands of storylines speeding to no foreseeable conclusion. This was an epic tale that should have ended four books ago. The remaining installments should come with $100 bills attached to pay you to read them. Can TOR resurrect the author of the earlier books?"
1,The Mistress of Novices could assign this book for punishment.,"I have thoroughly enjoyed all of Robert Jordan's previous Wheel of Time books. Most have great action with spicy intrigue that give the reader an idea of how confusing it must have been to be in high politics in the days of royal courts, changing political climates and fast paced growth of ""Travel"". This book though, is all spice and no meat.There are too many new characters together in book 9. Old characters have mysterious motives for shadowy deeds; so shadowy you don't really know what they are doing or why you should care! I feel as though I sat down to a great banquet in Jordan's dream world Tel'aran'rhoid. Looked good but not filling.If you like mysterious characters and don't need action. You might like this. Just start it immediately after book 9. Maybe it will make sense to you.***Thank goodness book 11 is much much better and book 12 is awesome! **"
2,Yawn,"I used to eagerly await each new installment in this series. I doubt if I even finished book #9. It was not memorable. I am still debating whether to subject myself to #10. Besides, isn't the next book supposedly due out after this one a pre-novel? Doesn't an author usually do that after FINISHING the current series? So how long will we have to wait for longwinded #11? I thought this series was originally planned to be 10 volumes long? Will this series ever end, or at least pick up the momentum it lost 4 books ago?"
2,Taking the wrong Crossroads,"This 10th volume of the Wheel of Time seems to have come up with a flat. Although written in Jordan's usual style with copious detail and characterization, absolutely nothing happens until the last chapter, with Egwene running into trouble. It seems that Jordan could not decide where the series is going and was marking time until he decides. A reader could skip this volume with no loss."
3,Filler,"Though this book moves very slowly, it still has the intricate character development of the Wheel of Time series making it a wonderful step towards the Last Battle. If Jordan is Going to end his series in 12 books, he has to tie up a lot of loose ends. Book 10 is setting us up for something great and making sense of some of the previous books. It's filler."
3,"Solid, but marred by a lack of plot development","I read the this 10th installment within days of its November 2002 release, and have now just recently gone through the mass of bad reviews written by so many readers. I have to agree to some point. I have enjoyed the WoT since first picking up the first book some 4 years ago. Where as I would have rated the first nine 4 to 5 stars, I find myself a little disappointed after the 10th. Still well written and still compelled, I for one am prepared to read two or three more novels, as long as the plot develops and moves on. For the first time in the series, it really doesn't. Jordan has some work to do in number 11 to rekindle that majic. Otherwise, this reader, like so many others will be rating the next even lower."
2,An Interesting Question,"I began reading the Wheel of Time about two years ago. I read straight from the beginning to the end in about two months and loved just about every minute of it. Granted there were parts in the later books that I spaced out through a bit and some of the Nynaeve/Elayne chapters could grate on my nerves, but I didn't have any real problem with those later volumes. I loved Winter's Heart. I've since re-read the series 3 times. Now we have Crossroads of Twilight. It's the first book in the series that I've actually had to wait for. I'm very disappointed. I mean honestly, the biggest event in Perrins story is the purchase of grain? Here's what I find curious though: am I dissapointed because the book is grossly inferior to the others or because I had undue expectations? Maybe I'll just have to re-read the series again with no expectations placed on this book and see how it fits in. Oh well. Maybe the next one won't take so long."
1,This Book is so Boring,"I knew that Robert Jordan was long winded, but come on. How many pages of this book are devoted to what an Aes Sedai is wearing or what look she has on her face? And if I read one more line about the Warders' shifting cloaks I am going to scream. WE KNOW ABOUT THE CLOAKS ALREADY!!! Honestly, the wardrobes don't matter. After about 350 pages of this I started skipping entire sections of description.In the past, I have really looked forward to the release of the next book in the series. Now, I don't really care when the next one is coming out. Besides, at this rate the series is going to take 20 books to finish."
3,"Tries the Patience, but still entertaining","There is no denying there is not much action in this book. More new characters are introduced, and more things are being set up for the next book. It is hard to keep everyone's names and backgrounds straight too, outside of the central characters. I couldn't read it the first time I started, but once I stopped caring a bit about what should happen I enjoyed it a bit more. This series will probably go on forever. The book gets better as it goes along."
1,What an waste!,"If you liked the Books 7, 8 and 9, you will love this one. It continues the 'pattern' of 1000 pages of nothing. I am so disappointed and angry I can not write or think clearly. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Mine will be for sale online in 2 minutes. Read the first six, go online and read a synopsis of all since then, and let us hope all the current outrage will force Jordan into putting a knife into this plotline. George R. R. Martin has plainly surpassed Jordan as the best author in the genre."
1,"More Like ""Crossroads of Boredom""","This book was a huge, disappointing, waste of time. Other than the Mat section, the entire book is just filler. Even the book description is terribly misleading. It should read like this:Perrin Aybara seeks to free his wife, Faile, but first he must deal with the menacing problem of weevils in the barley. Can the townspeople remove the weevils in time, so that the soldiers can eat bread? (who cares?)At Tar Valon, Egwene prepares to lay siege to Tar Valon. Will something else come along that will distract her enough to put off this plot thread for the entire novel? (answer: yes)In Andor, Elayne fights for the Lion Throne (By novel's end, she is still fighting for the Lion Throne).For Rand al'Thor, nothing happens the entire book (NOTHING).In summary, do not waste your money. You can pick up the next one and not miss a thing. Hopefully, some plot development will actually occur in that one. Unfortunately, we have to wait another two years to find out."
1,I want my money back,"How can it be that the same author that wrote the first four excellent books of this series produced this drivel? Not a single thing happened. I kept on reading thinking that something significant was going to happen in the following chapter but it never did.I will read his next book because I have invested so much time in the first ten books, however I am certainly not holding my breath for its release.I can only hope that Mr Jordan takes note of what his fans are saying and makes the next book a lot more exciting."
2,The Wheel of Time Moves Slowly,"I have been following ""The Wheel of Time"" series over the years. I have really enjoyed the series until the last few books, and this book the ""Crossroads of Twilight"" has been my biggest disappointment yet.After reading the 672 pages, I conclude that I am growing very weary of pages upon pages of two line descriptions of differing Aes Sedai glaring at each other. I have also lost interest in the many paragraphs of detail going into the lack of weevil infested food Egwene is consuming, and with the lengthy descriptions of the embroidery on the characters clothing.The positive points of the story for me were the chapters involving Mat and Tuon's growing relationship and the chapter where Alviarin is marked.I will continue reading the series because I feel so invested in the characters and do very much want to read the outcome of this story. My wish is for ""The Wheel of Time"" to turn a little faster, and to keep with the pacing set in the first few books of this series."
2,Please move the story along.,"I have been following ""The Wheel of Time"" series over the years. I have really enjoyed the series until the last few books, and this book the ""Crossroads of Twilight"" has been my biggest disappointment yet.After reading the 665 pages, I conclude that I am growing very weary of pages upon pages of two line descriptions of differing Aes Sedai glaring at each other.

My wish is for ""The Wheel of Time"" to turn a little faster, and to keep with the pacing set in the first few books of this series."
1,Worst.....book....ever!,"It makes me very sad to think about the WoT series now. It started out so incredible I remember telling people that I thought Jordan had the talent to surpass Tolkien. Oh how wrong I was. This series has consistently fallen into mediocrity, and with this latest attempt has actually become quite bad. I was pretty excited at the end of the previous book since I thought the series was finally going to be getting back on track. Again, oh how wrong I was. An advanced calculus text is way more stimulating than this book was. I normally take about a week to read a book of this size -- this particular book took me 3 months to trudge through. About the only good thing to say about it is that it's better than a glass of warm milk for putting you to sleep at night.CoT is a 100 page prologue to book 11 that was padded and stretched into a 680 page book. It's offensive to see how little respect Jordan has for his readers and his own series."
1,A Really Bad Novel,"I felt very dissatisfied after reading this book. I'm such a fan that I reread all the other books again before reading this one, but that didn't help my sense of outrage after finishing it. I was so frustrated to realize I was reading endless and pointless details that could drive one mad. I don't care how to wash silk, draw a bath, or how salt is made or sold. And will RJ ever learn that anything involving the Andoran succession or the Whitecloaks bores us to tears? Do we really need an extended scene of Perrin scoping out his camp, complete with ludicrous scent assessments every novel?Space taken up by this filler could have been used to actually tie up some plot lines, but no such luck. Believe the bad hype -- nothing of significance is resolved and barely anything happens."
1,He's finally done it,"Jordan finally achieved what he has apparently been trying to do since book 5 of this series - write a book that goes nowhere. The four to five pages of Crossroads of Twilight that actually involve Rand are succinct and to the point, but the rest of the book is ridiculous. Jordan routinely takes several pages at a time to describe a conflict between two characters that are clearly minor side carachters with little to do with advancing the plot. This book ends as if Jordan were simply tired of writing, and wanted to publish something to keep readers interested in his series."
1,Don't buy the hardcover,Wait until all the books are out before you buy this one. He's milking it for all he's worth at this point.
2,"If You Read Book Nine, You're still Up-to-Date","The pace of the plot has slowed down over the last three books in the series, but up until now at least SOMETHING was resolved in each book. Jordan is not nearly an author of the quality required to hold one's interest through such tedious plot development. After over 6000 pages in the previous books, there's no need for developing the characters.There's a cheesy ""to-be-continued"" ending. However, I was so bored two-thirds of the way through that I'd skipped ahead to the end and cheated myself of the one unexpected turn in the entire book.If you've already read the first nine books, nothing anybody says will keep you from reading this one. Heck, I read it all too. Save yourself some money though, wait for the paperback edition or buy it used. Save yourself some time and wait for book 11 (or Book 12 at this rate)."
2,A long prologue,"The book was very slow moving and not much happened. It seems like things are set up nicely for book 11 to be filled with plot advancement and excitement, but this book had little of that. Crossroads was basically one long prologue. There were a few good parts which I did enjoy, thus, I gave it two stars instead of one. I hope the next book is better than this."
2,Disappointed,"What a load of rubbish!I have been reading this series for 10 years and eagerly awaited this next installment. Instead of action and wonderfully rich story telling I got 600 odd pages of the politics of the Aes Sedai. The main character of the story, Rand, didn't enter the book until about page 520. The plot didn't advance, no one did anything. It was, in comparison to his last nine books, boring and tedious.Come on Mr Jordan, stop trying to pad out an extra book or 2. Keep the story moving and let it end when it has too. Another book like this will result in your millions of fans worldwide getting fed up and abandoning the series."
1,"If someone wrote a parody on wheel of time, this is it","800 pages where almost nothing happens at all. Last page contains the only significant event, like a parody on all movie series ""please stay tuned, will he make it, what will happen next..."". There were a total of about 50 pages that I found enjoyable, recognising the writers ability to make a good story. Rest of the pages were read waiting for the story to start moving, for some intriguing story. In fact, if I decide to read the next book based on the fact that the previous books were better even if they have deteriated the longer into the series we get, I could have skipped this book totally and never even have known that I missed a book in the series.--- Mats ---"
2,Nothing happened!!!,"I started reading these books years ago. They started slow and then got really good in the middle but the last two books have been disappointing.After reading book nine, I thought, hey, very little happened! I felt sure that book ten would fix this and move the story forward.Unfortunately, nothing happened..lets repeat that...Nothing Happens!!!! Most of the book is spent moving characters around but very little is achieved. Also Jordan is tending to focus more and more on repeatedly describing the same types of character interactions. It is getting boring!!!I figure, I'll give him one more book to move the story forward in a real way and then that is it for me.A very disappointed fan."
1,Borrow this from a friend...,"...because the ONLY way this series is ever going to return to form is if the readers vote with their wallets. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. Only by impacting sales will we get our Jordan back. If you feel compelled to read this, at least get together with friends and pool your resources.I won't rehash the ad-infinitum ""nothing happens"". Suffice it to say that it doesn't.If you want to see tight writing, plot advancement with every chapter, and a complex world, I suggest you head over to George R. R. Martin. Same long waits between books but much more payoff"
2,WoT turns Mos (more of same),Without piling on this is going no-where fast and this book goes absolutely no-where. It does continue the story for the next book though.
3,The best Series I have ever read!,"I have read every book in the series at least 5 times, and each book has emboldened my appreciation for Robert Jordans writing style. This book tends to be a catch-up for all of the characters that you didn't hear much about in the last few books. Book ten does move you ahead in many ways, but until about halfway through you don't catch up to the end of the last book. I love the way Mr. Jordan explains the relations between men and women, I find myself agreeing often. Mat and Tuon is a romantic strugle to even attract a womans attentions to this type of series. This book has a lot of twists and turns that you have to follow, to see who is a darkfriend, and who isn't. In conclusion if you read book one, you probably have read them all, and are waiting impatiently for book 11(as I am). You shouldn't be dissapointed, this is an excellent book. But, Oh, would I love to pick Robert Jordans brain.=:)"
3,"I used to be a ""Oh! NO! Not another one!"" groaner.","I used to be a ""Oh! NO! Not another one!"" groaner, but I've changed my mind. Yes, the break-neck speed is gone, but it has been replaced with some very thoughtful insight, I think, on Jordans part. The ""middle"" acts have always been about furthering the conflict, building suspense, raising questions, and Jordan seems to be, *HOPEFULLY*, building to a finale that should deliver very well.He does pack a lot of information into these books and I had thought not very cohesively, but, I have since changed my mind about that. The books that seem ""SLOW"" are very revealing. I must admit I had to go back and re-read because I could not remember specifically a lot of the material, but, once I did I was like ""Aha!!"" that makes sense now.I say this to say that, although not as rousing as the first 3 or 4 books, the lastest are every bit as satisfying, to me, but in a different way."
2,The Flying Dutchman,"Like the Flying Dutchman this story seems destined to never reach shore, or in this case a conclusion. This particular installment is particularly unsatisfying as it covers very little ground and does so in excruciating detail. The rumor that this series will conclude in a mere twelve total volumes seems unfounded based on the current pacing and amount of material to be covered.So a word to the wise, if you haven't started the series don't. If you have don't buy this book, go to your library and get on the waiting list. Trust me, you can wait."
2,Good lovin' gone bad,"As Robert Jordan continues his epic story of Good and Evil, he continues to dilute the plot with oceans of minutae. Many books ago, the reader caught on that the final battle would involve many, many people and creatures on both sides. Tragically, Mr. Jordan sees fit to name each and every one, including their rich diverse backgrounds and relationships with every other living thing. The result is rambling long books involving little action, and holding precious little interest. To be sure, Mr. Jordan writes descriptively well. But the last several books have no longer been as eagerly awaited as the first five or six. Even the most diehard of fans are losing interest, as they can get their epic fantasy fix from the likes of Peter Jackson. Rereading the LotR trilogy reminds one how an epic tale can indeed conclude. Mr. Jordan should take note. Of course, as an author, writing for money is what he does, a fact that has become disturbingly clear every two years lately."
2,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"In ""Crossroads of Twilight"" Robert Jordan has hit a new low. In each of the previous 9 installments of the Wheel of Time, at least *one* major sub-plot or mystery was brought to some sort of closure. Not so here. Virtually nothing at all happens. Do yourself a favor. Save the ... bucks and wait for the Reader's Digest version. Jordan has ""forsaken"" his loyal audience in what I can only assume is a crass (albeit successful) attempt to milk every dime out of this now-wearisome psuedo-epic."
2,Disappointed,"With the Wheel of Time series Robert Jordan created and introduced interesting characters involved in the familiar (but with a unique flare) theme of good versus evil. Crossroads of Twilight, however, is not worthy of Robert Jordan or the Wheel of Time.Robert Jordan needs to reread the first 3-4 books in the Wheel of Time series, revive his writing style and retake control of the story. He also needs an editor who will cull out unnecessary details. (Compare the first book in the series (The Eye of the World) to this latest effort -- you will be astonished at the change in style, content, and pacing.)I hope that the remaining Wheel of Time books will reflect Mr. Jordan's work earlier in the series."
2,Bogging down in the details,"Robert Jordan my be losing control of his creation. He has introduced too many minor plot lines and twists that are now bogging down the story to the point where nothing happens. The plot doesn't move forward in this book, in fact, it barely catches up to the end of the last book. Most of the book is concerned with details that really should have been taken care of in the prologe. The problem with that is the prologue was already 1/7 of the book. Robert Jordan really needs to decide where he's going with the story and trim a little of the fat. As it is he's heading into a disturbing patter of every other book being good. Four years is a long time to wait for any sort of plot movement."
1,Takes too long to get into the story,Boy this book takes like half the book to finally get into anything meaty. I tried reading this book several times before I just put it down. The writing in this book also doesn't seem very clear and concise. Maybe I was bored out of my mind after reading 5 chapters that I wasn't paying attention anymore. Or it could be the Robert Jordan is just getting too old to write good books.
3,it IS a wheel - no end in sight,"The tenth in the seemingly never-ending Wheel of Time series (seriously, is this wheel ever going to stop rolling?). Rand al'Thor is still the Dragon Reborn, still fighting against the Dark One, and still counting on his friends Mat Cauthon and Perrin Aybara. Perrin's wife has been kidnapped by the Shaido, and Perrin is giving chase as best he can. Mat is fighting his way out of Seanchan territory with Tuon, the Daughter of the Nine Moons, whom he's been told he will marry someday. Elayne Trakand, one of Rand's three sister-wives, is trying to solidly claim the Lion Throne of Andor. And this is all just part of the plot. Not a lot of resolution here, unfortunately, but KNIFE OF DREAMS has recently been published in paperback and I'm told there is some resolution there."
4,You know....,"I really enjoyed this book, despite all the negative reviews I'd heard prior to reading. Sure, there wasn't a great deal of action, but there were many interesting plot and character developments, and I still adore Jordan's writing style. Descriptive, but not overly so. (And to anyone who disagrees--try reading anything by Dennis L McKiernan, THEN tell me CoT has too much description). Overall, this book was a turning point in the series, and I think readers can look forward to more fast-paced books in the future."
1,Enough already!,"After a couple of books where nothing happened, there was an Event in Book 9. So I tried Book 10 in the hopes the story would start picking up again. My advice? Wait until the book appears in your local library. At least it'll be free, so you won't be wasting your money. You'll still be wasting your time though.This is a shame because I really enjoyed the first 5 of the Wheel of Time series. How things have fallen."
2,Does it ever end?,"I started reading the series about 6 years ago. Several of the books had already been published. They were fun, intriguing and had a beginning a middle and some sort of conclusion. The last three books have been awful and this one failed to please. Just end it. If not, bring some of these strands together. How many characters have been introduced only to never be heard from again? Enough. I am done with this. Great promise that has turned into nothing."
2,I have to agree with the others.,"This book covered nothing and went nowhere with the plot. Most of the events covered in this book happen just before and during the cleansing of the male half of the source and we end up right where we were at the end of Winters Heart. There is no development of Mat or Perrins situations, lots of descriptions of them, but no development. Rand at the end is seen to have surrvived, but there is little or no mention of what effect the cleansing of the male half has had. I really expected better from Robert. This book almost seems like he suddenly discovered that he only had 11 books worth of material and a contract for 12. The only good thing is that I didn't put out the money for this book. The bad thing is that someone who loves me did pay for this."
2,Down the drain...,"Up to Book 5 or even 6 this series deserved 5 stars. Since then, Jordan has dwelled too long on describing boring and prosy side plots over several chapters that should have gotten no more than a paragraph at the most! Back to the captivating descriptions and spellbinding narrative of the first books Robert, please!!"
1,"If you love the ""memory"" of the WoT DO NOT READ this book","I' m writing this review in the hope to aid Jordan's fan (like myself) entrapped in the serie:Bee better than me stop reading WoT books!CoT goes nowere, it leaves you at the same point of the previous book (or nearly the same to not make difference), it's a 700 pages long waste of time, in my opinion Jordan has lost count of haw many plots has opened and goes on in opening new, without closing any.It's a pity to so review a book of Jordan, but it is only and simply the truth"
2,This was a Jordan book?,"You know... I've always considered Robert Jordan ""chunky"" reading. By that I mean there is always something going on, new plotlines, new twists on old plotlines, new characters...But I finished this book and thought to myself ""Was there anything at ALL in there that was worth reading?"" For the first time in this series, the answer was ""No.""I kind of liked the update where we all found out what everyone was doing when Rand and Nynaeve cleansed the Source, but my God... 300+ pages of it? And even when Jordan had finished treading water he just sank.This is a horribly disappointing book. The only reason it gets two stars is because Jordan has enough talent to make fluff mildly readable. Sadly, we all know he has more talent than this book shows.Note to Mr. Jordan: If you're tired of writing about your world, then just let us know. We'd rather find a new and interesting one than line your pockets."
1,Don't Bother.,"After reading the previous 9 books of the series multiple times, recommending this series to several friends, and now after reading this tenth book I have two words for anyone interested in picking up the series: ""DON'T BOTHER"". The only thing you will be able to take away from this book is that either RJ is in desperate need of money and is looking to line his pockets or that he has absolutely no clue as to where this series is headed. The first six books of this series were outstanding, seven through nine could be stomached, but ten is a very bad soap opera. Nothing happens in this book and it goes nowhere. Anyone considering picking up the series should wait until RJ finishes it, if he ever does. Otherwise, you could be waiting around for years until he produces another book that in all likelihood would be the same as this one a load of [junk]"
3,a plea for our sanity,"It is obvious from the large number of reviewers for this book that there are many people out there who have liked this series, and would like it again, if the big bang of events and would cease to stop expanding and start collapsing toward the end. Perhaps the galaxies of this book have expanded too far for them ever to come back again. But, given that so many reviewers express hope that an end is in sight, that the books could surprise and delight us (and not with more new subplots), Mr. Jordan, please hear our plea. We want to enjoy reading your books again."
1,The Series Is Officially Dead.,"When I reached page 498, I realized that Rand had died in book nine. For those of you who are confused, I think Jordan hid Rand's death somewhere after the epilogue in the extensive glossary. I came to this conclusion, because I knew no sane writer would write such a long and boring 500 pages without ONCE including the main character... unless... unless he had some crazy brilliant ulterior motive. It's either that or Jordan needed some quick cash. Now, I don't think I spent all these many hours reading his book just to make him richer, do you?"
1,Lazy writing,"All ground that has already been covered. Absolutly the longest most boring book I've read outside of school work.I'm so far into the series I feel like I can't get out, but I will no longer buy hard cover and the library will have to loan me a copy as I refuse to pay for it."
2,Too Long,This series is geeting ridiculous. Nothing occured in this book or in the one before it for that matter. Jordan needs to wrap things up in his next book.
1,Reading the reviews can be quite enjoyable!,"As others have, I've been with this series since the beginning and can't seem to break away, even when I know it only gets worse (the story-telling, that is) with each book. Well, I've just finished the Prologue chapter and it only took me a little more than a week to do so, and most of that only when I needed something to read while doing my business on the porcelain throne.Anyways, I just wanted to say that I've been reading the reviews (both for this particular installment of the WoT and the previous books), and wanted to point out that the reviews are more entertaining to read than the books!! I especially like the one that said Jordan's die-hard fans would give the toilet paper he wiped his butt with 5 stars!! Hilarious!! There are more reviews like this out there...just spend a few moments perusing them and you'll start enjoying yourself, too!"
1,A poor tapestry of a story,"Mr Jordan ought to be ashamed of himself. This book (only in the sense that it contains words on paper)does absolutely nothing to move the story. At this rate Rand doesn't have to worry about fighting the Dark Lord in the final battle, he will be dead of boredom. Don't buy this book! Go to the library borrow the book and read evry 50th page, you won't miss a thing. I would suggest to Mr. Jordan that if this his what he has left, do us all a favor and wrap up the story in an article in Reader's Digest. We can read the end while sitting in the bathroom. Fiiting description for what he has written."
1,Ditto,"Little more to add than than most of the other reviewers. The WOT series started out with a bang, but has since bogged down. Good luck with your series Mr. Jordon - I'm off to other authors."
1,"Not again, the pain oh the pain",RJ started out with a very good story. I agree with what has been said so far. Lets end this before I die. I purchased book 9 on tape so I could listen while driving. It put me to sleep. I hope he knows how to finish a story. I think I'll get the next one from a used book yard sale.
2,"Ok, so in two years this is what you came up with?","I could of written something like that in 1 year, and I don't know squat. Although my plot line probably wouldn't line up or be as tedious as that.Only read this because, well lets face it, you probably read the first nine and can't wait to see what's going to happen. And nothing did in this book.Lets only hope it doesn't take him another two years for book 11.cause with they way he's going chances are we won't be alive long enough to see this thing through."
1,Worthless...,"This book was a complete disappointment. If you have read the previous nine books, you can just skip this one. There is absolutely no useful plot development, no action, nothing.I cannot believe I waited two years for this..."
3,Wheel of Infinite Time,"For those frustrated with this series, I offer the following advice:Quit reading them until the series is done and all in paperback. The series is very complex with lots of characters and details and reading the next book as soon as it comes every 2 years is a waste of your time.After reading Path of Daggers and realizing I had forgotten a lot of the details of the previous books brought me to this realization. I like the series and want to read it, but I refuse to subject myself to agonizing game of creeping along a little bit every couple years. I'll be back when he is done."
2,Book 10 the well of time,It lead on too much and not too much action like the rest of the books..no major developments..disses appointing in many ways. Too many unknown boring characters
2,Getting Worse,"This series started out great with the first few books, but at around six or seven it started to go nowhere. The only reason I read Crossroads of Twilight was because the series started out so well and I kept hoping it would get back on track. I am sorry I wasted my time. All it seems to be about now is gossip between the rival female characters."
1,I think Twilight has set on the this series...,"Soon, night must fall. Hopefully, very soon!This book was so boring, it took me 7 months to read and even when I picked it up, I could only skim it just to get the basic idea and see if anything happens. Unfortunately, nothing happened in this book. It was 672 pages of utter boredom. What a waste of money.Mr. Jordan, finish this series already! By the way, I will never buy one of your books new again. you are no longer worth the money."
3,Going nowhere,"The whole book was a lot of talk about nothing. I thought the last book did nothing, but I was not prepared for how slow this one moved along. I know that the series has been a money maker for Mr. Jordan and his publisher, but the series has to come to an end at some point. Even if there are four more books, the readers are going to be so bored that no one will be buying them. I thought something really great would happen in this book, but in truth it was just a lot of talk and intrigues. If you read the last book, then you don't really need to read this one to know what is happening in the story line. I really hope the next book is much better, like the early ones were."
1,Nothing in too many words,"I have always been a fan of Jordan, but this book is just a let down. I cannot get past page 100. How can anyone say nothing in so many pages? Jordan must be getting paid by the word. Good thing this book was given to me as a gift."
2,DISAPPOINTING,"In one word, DISAPPOINTING. RJ has stretched the plot so thin, eight (!) different sub-plots going on in parallel, that after you've gone through the 680 pages you realize nothing much has happened! There was more action packed into one chapter in the first few books than the whole of this one. I can't help suspecting that RJ is stretching (milking?) The Wheel of Time on and on so he can get to book Twenty and we will still all be waiting for Taimon Gideon....."
2,Borrow this one from a friend,"Robert Jordan is a great fantasy writer no doubt about it. There were pages in this book that made me feel like I was reading the Dragon Reborn again. The chapters about Matt were at least as good as anything else in the series. For that alone I give the book two stars.Still, I can't see rewarding him by buying this book. Get it in paperback or borrow it from a friend and save it for a rainy day."
1,disapointment,"I have read so far all the series with great enthusiasm, I hope to keep doing it but it is more difficult every day.This last book was too slow for me. The plot has no progress, instead of action in every scene we get the color of the dress, the place in the room where they sit, the personal history of the cabinet maker who made the chair ... you know where i'm getting to.The name and personal history thoughts and philosophy of yet another character that does nothing to advance the plot is not what I payed for.So for a series with great promise, and strong and interesting main characters, I am a disappointed.In summary of the 800 pages, Rand only shows on page 600 and we get 200 pages of plot. And then the book ends abruptly.The first book was amazing, I hope the next one can live to earlier expectations."

1,Slow as Molasses,"I have been eagerly awaiting this book since I finished reading Winter's Heart. I was excited to see how cleansed Saidin would be handled. Sadly, the subject barely even came up. Most of the book seemed to be dedicated to describing what people were wearing and what a room looked like. The various plots were advanced only a few weeks in the time frame and even then it was hard to keep track.It appears as if Jordan is running out of inspiration and is just plodding along to meet deadlines. I know he can do better work than this. I hope that he will wait until he has a good product before publishing the next book. As it is, if another one comes out soon, I will probably not buy it and wait until it hits the librariers or used book stores."
1,Blah Blah Blah,"Blah blah blah, aesedi so and so, blah blah blah, asedi such and such blah blah blah.That is what I feel I just read.Robert Jordan has just insulted my intelligence for the last time. I am done reading this series. I can not believe this major climax that he is supposedly building up to can possibly redeem this series in my eyes."
1,redundency,"well if you were like me and loved the way book 9 ended, couldnt wait to find out what happens next, you will be waiting till book 11Mr Jordan decided to use book 10 to detail what EVERYONE ELSE was doing at the end of book nine. Save your money, buy book 11 when it comes out, the prologue will fill you in on anything you think your missing. As for me, I will NEVER buy one of these in hardcover again after this disapointment"
1,Loosing Impetus,"I want to be fair and objective about this series so, I have to begin by saying that the first 4 volumes were excellent. Since then, however, the series has gotten progressively more boring. If Brian Jordans ambition was to see how long he could drag out a story he has succeeded. The earlier tension and plot have been lost and much like Terry Goodkinds' ""Wizards 1st Rule"", the ""Wheel of Time"" seems to have lost its way. Every book, and this one is no exception, introduces a stream of new characters whose purpose in the tale seems ornamental at best. Please finish this series in the next book."
2,not up to standard,well i am irish and i bought this book before christmas and to tell the truth i am rather disappointed. the Mat thing is alright but Rand is all over the place. it would seem that this book is just another filler in. It is not up to the standard of the first four
1,I am more to blame than Jordan,"I was vacationing in Kenya when I finished ""Eldest"" and needed a new book desperately. The only book of interest I found a bookstore in Mombasa was Crossroads of Twilight. For some reason I do not remember, I read all previous 9 books in the Wheel of Time epic (and I use that in the negative sense). So I place the blame squarely on my shoulders for reading such an awful book.Jordan creates a fascinating world, but after Book III, he gets lost in his own story. Honestly, and without exaggeration, there is not ONE plot development in this book. Yes, that's correct: not one thing of importance happens in the 800+ pages. Unfortunately, that has become the norm for Robert Jordan. If you just have to finish this series (I am officially at the ""I could care less"" stage), do yourself a favor and skip this book and go on to Book XI."
2,Enough Already,"Never have characters done so little in 680 pages. Not that it matters, because if you are this far in, do you really have a choice but to read it? Still, I would wait until it is in the bargain bin."
1,The plot (?) of this book,"Spoiler alert: I'm going to write about the book's plot. Mind you: the entire plot, so skip this if you don't like it be shown before reading.1) Rand is alive and is going insane.2) Mat is going to marry Tuon and is escaping with her after having kidnapped her.3) Faile is still captive under the Shaidos and Perrin is trying to rescue her.4) The whole tea available in Caemlyn has been drunk by Elayne (who is pregnant).5) The Black Ajah does exist.6) Egwene has been captured by someone (more about it in the next book I guess).We already knew about points 1,2,3, 4 and 5 from previous book(s). What a pity point 6 is adding something new to the plot.Sorry for wall of text. I will never be able to be as brief as Mr. Jordan in my descriptions."
1,Finish the Series Already!!,"I've been reading the Wheel of Time series for over a decade!! The author is doing no service to any of the loyal readers by dragging this story painfully ..on and on and on and on ...AND in the meantime writing other books AND a ""Prequel"" of all things!! I don't care if the good guys all get torturously killed at this point ...just bring it to a CONCLUSION and end my torture!!"
2,Very Disappointing,"I've been a huge fan of this series and was eagerly anticipating the release of this book-I actually even went to a book signing for it. I'm very disappointed since nothing really happens to advance the story. It sort-of felt like homework to finish it because it's boring and slow paced. Many of the main characters appear only peripherally and I hated the way the book ended. I hope that the next book in this series is better. I won't lie and say that I'll never read another Wheel of Time book again, but it certainly won't be with the same enthusiasm as before."
3,Bridge across water...,"As many others I was disappointed that RJ did not progress the storyline farther then he did in this book. Too many interesting details and conversations are begun and hinted at but not written for us to read, instead we are still reading about trees and the smoothing of clothing. I was pleased with the advancement of Mat and Perrin and would have liked to have read more on Rand since he has been virtually a small character in books 9 & 10. Books 9 & 10 remind me somewhat of The Two Towers in that they are connectors from the beginning of the series when everything is new and dramatic to the end with the final battle. They contain necessary information for those who like details but I would not choose to put other activities on hold to read this book."
2,"Wow, talk about a big letdown","I remember back in the day with Eye of the World. That book got me into Fantasy. Now years later, Crossroads of Twilight makes me want to stop reading fantasy. This is by far the most convoluted book I have ever read. The descriptions are long, dialogues between characters few, and action non-existent. I mean what happened to Mr. Jordan. He reminds of another Mr. Jordan who should have retired when he was ahead(Micheal Jordan for anyone who doesn't get he allusion. I won't spoil the book by going into details, but let's just say this might be a book worth renting from the library and skimming, but most definitely not worth buying and reading carefully.I think you time is better spent read George R. R. Martin or Robin Hobb then this drivel. What really irks me is the build up for this book yet it didn't even come close to my expectations.In the words of Smithers from the simpsons, ""BOOURRNNSSS"""
1,I wasted my money again!,I finally believe that Robert Jordan is lost to the commercial word and is selling his novels by the word. He needs to get back to the story that has intriged millions for the first 8 novels. His lack of focus and story line in this novel is boring. I could not finish the book. I am absolutely sick of the endless facial and positional posturing of every single encounter and conversation in the book. Four and a half pages to describe climbing a hill... and then did nothing once they got there!
2,Um...Mr. Jordan? It's starting to hurt now.,"How long, Mr. Jordan? How long before the Wheel of Time finally runs out of Saldyllic varnish and its spokes start to rot with the Cursed Diseases of the Whitecloak? How long before Rand al-Thor and the rest of his wretched, two-dimension ilk burn in the eternal flames as the Wheel of Time crashes into their forlorn planet and explodes in a fiery ball of...um...fire? How long until this extremely tedious and repetitive series comes to close!?Nothing much happens in this book. Some people mumble, some people walk around, and the plot slows to a snail's crawl. I gave up a few hundred thousand trilogies ago but the Dragon's Crossorads (or whatever the hell it's called) are still awful."
2,i keep reading all the books in the series because of the first 6 i had read,"After reading a couple of reviews by people who did quite a good job of it The only thing I can say in my review is read the reviews of the people who gave this book 3 stars or less (especially the dude who was listening to the audio version, :) it's on the front page.)After reading the last 3-4 books in the WoT series I have decided against buying the whole series(something which I was seriously considering while reading books 3-7)"
1,What Happened?,"The books started out ok but fell apart when the author decided to stretch the series as long as it could go. Fanatics will say that it doesn't matter when you look at the big picture of the series. It only takes one mistake to screw up a good thing, and Jordan did a fantastic job ruining his books and has become an embarassment of the genre. This book is the worst of the series only moving the plot on the very last page of the book. I feel sorry for those I recommended this series to before i read the later books. I strongly ask you to avoid a all costs! Read A Song of Ice And Fire if your looking for a good read."
2,Who is the Hero?,"I'm sure that this is a good book...the only beef I have with it is that, simply, Rand Wasn't in it!!! Rand has been completely inacctive in the past two books (in that last one he was mostly innactive...but when he was in it was awesome.) I don't care about Matt's drinking! I don't care about Perrin's shrew of a wife...I want to hear about Rand!!! When is he going to start hanging out with his other ""girlfriends""? When is he going to take control of the Black Tower? When is he going to go on the offensive? I don't care about the crap that's going on in the White tower...or on some stupid continet an ocean away...I want to know what Rand is doing!!!"
1,"Get even, get this book at the library read it for free.","This book does nothing to advance the wheel of time story whatsoever. But don't take my word for it... read it yourself, go to the library and check it out, read it and then take it back. In this way you in some small way get even with Jordan, his editor and his publisher for the low quality of the last few novels. You get to read them, and they don't get a penny."
1,what happened to this series?,"This WAS a truly wonderful series of books. This one is just sad. Page after endless page of mind-numbing pointless detail where absolutely nothing happens. Does he not know where to go with the story? Or has it turned into such a cash cow for him that he is intent on churning out pointless book after pointless book just because people will buy them. Maybe someday Jordan will start writing again, until then skip it. This is a waste."
1,Who the wrote this?,"I am normally a very very big fan of RJ but this is by far the most horrible piece of [stuff] that he has ever written. This book goes absolutely no where. If you cut out the fluff there would only be about 200 pages in this book. You could then trim that 200 down to about 75 if you left the stuff that was crucial to the ongoing story line in and threw out the rest of the irrelevant plot tweakers. That would have made an excellent prologe to what should have been a brilliantly recieved tenth book.I am honestly begining to wonder if he is just milking all of this for the money. I mean come on 3 years between books, that would be forgiveable if this was a quality book that he took all that time writing but come on!"
1,The longest chapter ever written,"Once again Robert Jordan managed to write a book where almost nothing happened. Most writers would have covered book 10 in one, maybe two chapters. I can't help but wonder if he's just trying to drag the series out. I read book one when it first came out and it used to drive me crazy waiting for the next one. The last couple haven't been worth the wait. If this is the way his books are going to be from now on, maybe its time to end the series. If you've been following the series from the begining and have to read the book, check it out from the library. Don't bother buying it."
1,WOT: Waste of Time,"We are now ten books into this series and everyone is ready for something to happen that will answer some of the questions that Jordan has used to leave us all hanging. Yet, to my utter amazement Jordan chooses to go back in time rather than take the series forward. He goes through the painstaking process of telling us where every character was at the exact moment that Rand cleansed the Source in book 9. There is no development whatsoever in the plot. All of the major characters are doing exactly what they were doing back in book 9. What's Elayne up to these days? Still trying to secure the Lion Throne. How about good old Perrin? Sorry to disappoint you, but he's still chasing Faile and the Shaido. Surely, Egwene unites the Tower? Nope, she's still sitting outside of the Tower where Robert Jordan left her two years ago. Believe me, I already wasted my time on this book, don't bother wasting yours."
1,"Many words, many pages, no action","As Jordan writes more books, the action has decreased. Pages of minor, inconsequential characters' thoughts, descriptions of their clothing, meaningless conversations and other related trivia do not make an engrossing read. Let's face it, fantasy literature requires action, this book lacks it, and was boring. This series desperately needs things to happen. Next one that comes out, I'm going to wait for one of my friends to read it first, and if they tell me nothing happens in it either, I'll skip it even though I've invested alot of time reading 10 prior, long volumes. That's how dull this series is getting."
1,Couldn't be Jordan,This book could not have been written by Robert Jordan. I refuse to believe he is capable of writing such boring drivel. I would not be surprised if the publisher had someone else write this and put his name on it. This book was too painful to read. Thats how boring it was.
1,Book of Numbers vs. Crossroads of Twilight,"For anyone who's read the Old Testaments Book of Numbers, it's a close call for which one will put you to sleep faster. I read fantasy novels to be entertained. I WAS NOT ENTERTAINED. I was tortured. You could summarize the action in this book with about 10 bullet point sentences. NOTHING HAPPENS! The number of detailed new characters descriptions was mind boggling. And most of them are unimportant. And is EVERYONE in the story harder than steel, more dangerous than a viper, with eyes like a hungry hawk with an unflappable calmness? zzzz . . . zzzz . . . zzzz . . . This is just a big steaming pile of you know what. Yes, I read it all the way through. It was very painful."
1,A beautiful thing disregarded and destroyed.,"It cannot be emphasized enough how much I used to love this series.I've read the first 9 books many, many times. I loved trying to juggle the little clues in my head (who killed Asmo!?), and I was on the preorder list for this book when it came out in early January, almost two years ago.I read the book in three hours...and when I was done the book was thrown across the room, and later given to a 'friend' (Read: another glutton for punishment).I have revisited it many times since then, and in two years, my opinion of this book has only gotten worse.It is pure crap.Specifically:The cleansing and what came of it:We learned nothing. NOTHING!!! And that nothing only from the POVs of those WHO CHANNEL SAIDAR!!!!!(...)"
1,A trip to snoozeville with a stop in naptown,"This book is not worth the time you have to spend slugging through uninteresting plot line and boring characters hoping for a great climax. This book felt like a filler, and not even good filling.If you want to keep up on the story, I recommend looking on the internet for chapter summaries of this book and that will keep you up to date.This person will not be spending one penny on another book by Robert JordanDo not buy this book!"
1,"Skim it, at best","I've had it with Jordan. This is the last book of the Wheel of Time I will ever buy. I regret buying this one. Professional reviewers call for patience, ask us to wait because the NEXT book will be interesting. Give me a break! Jordan is spooning out endlessly tiresome minutae and characters that have little to do with the promised Last Battle. Besides, if the conclusion of this series ever happens, who is going to possibly remember a character in book seven, relating to one in ten, and back to something we all read years and years ago? If Jordan was a new author, this book would never be published."
1,Worst One Yet,"I won't bother addressing the snivelling bootlickers who defend any blathering prose as ""deep"" or ""far-reaching,"" as those who cannot recognize horrible prose (like this latest installment) are beyond reform. I would simply like to add that there is absolutely no excuse for the publisher to allow such clearly unedited...garbage to make it to press. Who cares if Jordan has already published lots of stuff? All the more reason to reign in his verbosity and suggest that the plot be central or, at the very least, addressed. This is simply pathetic, and no one in their right mind should purchase it. Perhaps not even libraries."
1,Skip this book!!!,"I have followed this series since the beginning, and I felt ripped off by the lack of action and movement that occured. I thought that the book had basically been written to make a few more bucks out of the people foolish enough to keep reading them. There are perephial characters added that may be pertainent to the ending, however, do nothing to advance the current story, and at the end of the book all of the characters are pretty much where they were at the beginning. I hardly think there is much that couldn't just have gone straight into the next book, and would suggest that unless you get this book free, or very inexpensively, to skip it, and hope the next one has more movement towards the conclusion of the story."
2,Is this going to go on forever?,"After more than one year of waiting, I started reading this book with the usual expectation I reserve for the ""eye of the world series"". Unfortunately it seems that Robert Jordan thinks he can make us go to the bookstore and buy the continuation of the continuation forever. He has made the series a money machine, and is not willing to advance to a conclusion. In Crossroads of twilight nothing happens. There is already so many characters and parallel plots that it takes the first 5/6pages to review them, and then he uses the following 1/6 to introduce more alternative plots. After ten books, I would feel comfortable if we advanced towards a conclusion, and concentrated on the main plot. Is this going to go on forever?The only positive thing I can say about the book is that the characters and Jordan's writing style have become so familiar that the book is as easy to read as a comic."
1,can't pick it up,"Very boring and disappointing book. Does not move story line, shuffle of players around RandLand. Enough said by others, would give it a 1/2 star instead of 1 star, because it did have a couple of chapters on Matt."
1,Skip this one,Its just a 700+ page prologue. You can skip this one and not miss anything of the total story.
1,"Jordan, how far can you slip?","Back a number of books ago, the Wheel of Time was rereadable. Now it is barely readable. It is not just that the plot doesn't advance; the characters don't develop. If you love page after page of woman sniffing, descriptions of dress color, and hands folded under the breast, this is for you. If not, it isn't."
2,"Ok, now I really feel like an ......","Ok, HOW long did we wait for book 10? 2 YEARS? This book went almost no where. Jordan is filling pages and pages with pure fluff. Having waited for this book for that entire time, I feel like I just got my chain yanked. Aside from a few major decisions being made, Jordan spends his words describing filthy clothing, and or just TALKING about clothing clean or not, for a great percentage of the book. Lots of describing scenery, and background, but little on plot devlopment and progression. I am very dissappointed with this book and it is starting to color my overall perceptions of the series. I hope he gets back to what he gave us in the first few installments, and I will likely ready whatever he may produce in the WOT in the future, but I won't be anticipating it or holding my breath."
2,As a die-hard Wheel of Time fan...,"I love the Wheel of Time. I've been waiting for this book for a long time. I've read the whole series many times... this book was a serious disappointment to me.Nothing happens.Then... it happens again.680 pages go by and it happens many times.I'm disappointed. Not a single plot was resolved in this book. Not even a minor plot. Only marginal hints were given as to what is to come and most of them completely ambiguous. All the major plots ended at high points where one more chapter could have given some closure. This would be fine if there was only 1 minute of commercials until it starts up again. Now we have to wait 2 years.I would never have thought of giving a Wheel of Time book below 4 stars until I read this book. I have no desire to reread it. That, for me, is a strange feeling. If the series doesn't get better I am dropping it while I still think of it as a good fnatasy series."
4,This book is not all that bad. In fact it's actually quite good.,"I understand what many other reviewers have written, and that is that this book's pace is too slow. While I agree that its pace is slower than most of the other books, I don't see that as a problem. Life is like that, some days are slower than others. At the end of reading this book, I found that I had enjoyed the time spent once again in Mr. Jordan's world.To all of the negative reviewers out there I say, ""Let's see you write something better."" Probably less than 1% of them have ever had a book published if that many. The reading world can always use more great [and good (like this one)] books out there."
2,"Ho hum,","Another in a long line of so-so books. they all have moments, I'll give you that. Just enough to keep me coming back for more. I will finish this series. I will! I will! I will! Though sometimes it's like going to your grandmother's house, fun at times but you'd rather not if you dont have too. A new author, Brian S, Pratt of The Unsuspecting Mage gave me what Mr. Jordan has been lacking in the last few of his novels. Action. There's none of this page after page of descriptions, he let's the reader's imagination fill in most of it. Mr. Jordan has lost track of what a reader wants, escapism, excitement, and most of all action! Maybe he should take a lesson from this newcomer and revitalize what was once a great series."
1,What the hell he is thinking ?,"Robert Jordan probably think that the readers are going to buy his book just because the words ""Wheel Of Time"" are written on it, because there is no other reason to read this book.HELLO ROBERT! the detailes are very important but where is the story?Maybe the next one will be better ( this one is so bad and it's not going to be a big problem to write a better one) but i don'tsuggest you to spend your time on it , you won't miss anything and you alredy spent enogh time on reding this review."
1,Waste of Time,"The Wheel of Time has become the Waste of Time. I have been a complete fan of Jordan's books - waiting breathlessly for them to be released. I intentionally saved this book to read as my reward for completing my graduate degree (and finally having the time to read). Boy was I disappointed. Jordan has taken this story line and made it so convoluted it is practically impossible to follow the plot. The foreward momentum seems to have stopped, and with all of the time bewteen books - you very nearly have to re-read the series just to figure out what is happening.While I will not abandon this series entirely - I will not purchase another book until the series is complete. Then I will wait to see how it ends before deciding to purchase. At least you can read this free from the library - because unless things change - it is unlikely Jordan will get another dollar of my hard-earned money."
2,Could we please GET somewhere!,"After reading other reviews, I was glad to see that I am not alone in thinking that this book did nothing for me. Robert Jordan has created this amazing world with such compelling characters. But there are so many sub-plots and useless descriptive (fill) narratives that in 600 pages you get maybe 20 pages of real plot advancement for thirty disconnected storylines. There is absolutely no sense of progression in this book, and no real climzx for the volume.This book is nothing more than 600 pages of what everyone is wearing before they got to book eleven.It will be a shame that this epic series may never see an end. The way I see it, either the elderly Jordan will pass on, or I will waiting for the next volume."
1,We Were Very Disappointed,My husband and I couldn't wait to get our hands on this book having read all the rest of the series. And the series is awesome! Until you get to this book. Nothing really happened. People just seemed to move through the story without really doing anything...and there was lots of waiting. For what? I'm not sure. Nothing new happened. Nothing was concluded. We ended up spending ... for a hardback book full of filler. We still like Mr. Jordan but we'll wait for the paperback of the next book and hope it's better than this one.
1,What the heck happened?,"I have found the rest of this collection to be quite good, so mush so that I'm reading the series again. Howerver this book was a HUGE let down. I'm still trying to figure out how this book adds to the over all story line. I mean nothing happened! there are a few parts that were intersting, such as finding out how Mat will mary the Daughter of the Nine Moons, and Egwene being capured. Other than that the book was lacking of any plot climax what so ever, no wait, it was lacking plot period. I recomend reading it when it comes to your local library and hope the next book will make up for this one."
1,Sooooooooooo Boring,"I love all the books in the series but vol 10 was boring beyond belief. It covered too much in each character from the maid you'll never read about again to taking up a whole page to set a mood. Geez, I would never guess it's even the same author."
1,What a waste,"I wish there had been an option for no star and I am certainly glad I waited to get this 700 page waste of time from the library rather than buying it. Jordan is going slower and slower in his plot advancement. What am I saying, there is no advancement at all. The only thing happening of note was Egwenes problem at the very end. That's it. The rest of the book discusses hemlines, dress styles, who is jealous of who, and the whole book moves maybe 2 weeks of no one doing anything. I read it, just because I waited 10 weeks to get it available at the library. The only time I have been this let down by hopeful anticipation, was after watching Joe Millionaire. Both a waste of time."
1,Very Very Slow,"I consider this book to be the worst so far in the series. Robert Jordan could have written what was in this book in about 5 pages but he took 700 pages it to do it. Also one of the main reasons I read this series is because no matter how slow the book is you can always expect something really cool to happen in the last 20 or so pages of the book. That was not the case in Crossroads of Twilight, the last 20 pages were just as boring as the rest of the book. If you have read the every book in this series as I have I'm sure this review won't change your mind but you should at least wait for it to come out in paperback before buying it. Lets hope that Jordan can actully put some action in to book 11."
3,"Slow, Yes. But Overly Slammed","Jordan continues to develop his saga in predictable fashion. A bit less action than the other books, but is that really why people read them?"
1,Enough is a Enough,"Any one else tired of more clothing descriptions?!!! I truly hope to finish this story before I die of old age! I just know I will buy the next book, I'm just too addicted. This book was the most boring yet. All the action happens behind the scenes and no fighting to speak of. Is their a war for the survival of goodness going on or not? Mr. Jordan your fans are begging you to quit milking this series and finish it in the next book. I need to get on with my life and you are the only one who can bring closure."
1,Not good,"Just download a summary instead of reading this book. All the characters just sit around and whine about the cold and how obnoxious men/women are. Right at the end one of the main characters does something totally stupid and out of character, and that's about the only interesting thing. So either download a summary, or skip the first 600 pages. I'm not kidding. You've been warned."
2,Big Let Down,"I really only have a couple of things to say. One - if R. Jordan would spend less time detailing the type of spices they add to wine served in worked silver goblets inlaid with ornate jewels, etc, less time detailing the type of clothing worn by the characters, less time mentioning how many women like to ""smooth their skirts"" when they were upset, we would probably only have 8 books in the series to this point and they might not have completely lost the potential that they once had.Talk about milking it for every penny. He should be ashamed of himself. Book 10 and we are really no further ahead than we were at the end of book 7. Boring. Boring. Boring!!! Two - the characters are what make the books stand out- Unfortunately, they have become secondary to the desire to have Book 27 in the Wheel of Time."
1,Minus 5 stars,The reviews complaining of how tedious and boring the plot development succeeds in being in a book that actually manages to be published are heaping more praise on this book than it deserves. Amazon's rating scale should extend at least 5 stars into the minus category- a minus 5 rating is more than this effort deserves.
1,How can you write 700 pages and not have anything happen?,"Here's how this one works. At the end of Book 9, some big stuff happened with Rand (no details in case you haven't read 9). This book is all about what the other characters were doing while Rand was doing his thing in Book 9. Here's the problem: There are about 5 chapters dedicated to what each main character was doing and how they learned about Rand's big day, and 1 dedicated to new action. And none dedicated to folks like the Children of the Light or Morgase. In short NOTHING HAPPENS, not even much politics. It's like a 700 page epiologue for Book 9. We don't even get to find out more about what was going on in Book 10's 95 page preface . . .Very disappointed. Hope George R.R. Martin can avoid this with his series . . ."
1,crossroads of twilight,"i was very disappointed with this book. After barely being able to put the earlier books down, this one made me go to sleep. All setup for the next volume, it seams to have been written just to make money. What I mean is that this books only purpose was to make all the fans purchase this book, make Jordan money and make fans wait for years until the book gets back to a decent story line. It seams like an army has been sitting next to the White Tower for 2 years now. All setup."
2,Flash!!! TOR editors piece together WOT 10 from scraps,"Two years is a long time to wait to see how much embroidery and lace Matt has come to like on his clothes. ""Glacial"" as one review suggests isn't even the word for the pace of the last two books. When RJ (or whoever) actually does advance any story line he does it in less than a paragraph, or, as a teaser. I truly enjoy this series, and if it never concluded that would be fine with me, but lets have a story. Before you buy this one, re-read the other nine, then re-read them again. There will be less time to brood between book 10 and book 11. The rest of us will just have to keep reading the Song of Ice and Fire series to keep ourselves occupied."
2,Did I actually do this to myself,"Don't get me wrong, I love this series, and will continue to read, but, come one! I am not sure if RJ has lost his way or not with the series, but it sure feels like it in this book. I eagerly look forward to the next installment, but I hope that he moves the stories forward.Overall, every story line seems to have moved sideways. There is nothing really new.Please, let the next book bring at least one story line to a close!"
1,Disappointing,"Since I had read other reviews on Amazon[.com], I didn't go out & buy the book, but got it from the library instead- thankfully. I really don't know what happened to this series- it started off great and now we're just bogged down in book after book that could be summarized in 5 chapters. And is it just me, or is the misogyny running even more rampant as the books continue? I would hate to think that all women are as smug, manipulative and haughty as Jordan makes them out to be. With the exception of Perrin and possibly Rand (though we barely see him in this book), there wasn't a single likeable character in the book. I'll still read the next books, just to find out what happens, but not with pleasure."
1,A call to action,"I'm glad to see all the bad reviews for this book. I started reading the Wheel of Time when I was in grad school in 95. I think the series was on about book 5 or 6 by then, and I happily read through the available books. The next one came out shortly thereafter, and I even bought the hardcover copy I was so excited to read it. Then 2 more years passed, and I read book 8. 2 more years, book 9. 2 more years, book 10. I've pretty much forgotten anything that has happened in the early books, and now all I remember is how painfully slow things happen. I expect Jordan to die before he finishes the series, leaving everyone hanging. And to make it worse, he releases a prequel to the series before he's even finished it? I refuse to buy any more of his books until (at least) he finishes the series. Perhaps if we all boycott the books, Jordan will wake up and realize he can't milk us for 10 more books and will end the thing."
2,Why o Why Mr. Jordan?,"Most of the reviews of this book and this series are completely accurate. The first five of six books of this series are among the greatest fantasy books ever written by anyone. Then Mr. Jordan decided to start trying to milk this for as many books as he can. Since those first five or six books this series has become plodding and uninteresting. I have continued to read each new instalment, hoping for the old magic, but it just hasn't come back. So unless your like me, and just wanting to hold out hope that this series will return to its old self, DO NOT buy any book from this series after you've read the first five or six."
1,Oh Man...,"Jordan can't even get TWO stars from his most loyal fans now? What a sad tragedy this has become. Books 1-5 were some of the best I have ever read (and I would still recommend them to anyone), but the magic has been over for a long time now for Jordan. When and if he ever finishes the series, I'll buy the last book to see how it turns out but this is just ridiculous."
1,Backtracking,"I was halfway through the book when I realized that the events transpiring hadn't even caught up with the END of the last book, chronologically! This story doesn't progress in a satisfactory fashion. I actually enjoyed reading the PLOT SUMMATIONS written by reviewers much more than I enjoyed reading the book itself. This is the last time. I'm done."
2,"It's amazing, really...","... how little can happen in so many pages. It took me a whole evening to read about two foreign women going shopping for red, green and blue fabric, for pete's sake. I have too much invested (as in years of my life) in this series to give up on it now, but I'm getting the next installment from the library (gasp!!) I'm giving this book two stars, though, because for some reason I just kept on reading - and it successfully got me to sleep every night."
1,Wretched,"I feel unclean.I forced myself to finish this book just in case I might have found an enjoyable chapter somewhere inside it. Sadly, Robert Jordan fails to deliver even one.The writing of this series once appeared great, but in retrospect, Jordan is a hack. The man got lucky, and is now trying to milk his early success for every penny. I for one, will not contribute to his royalty checks ever again.This book truly is awful, please, don't encourage him."
1,Endless Twilight,"Sorry to jump on the bandwagon, but Mr.Jordan, please get a new editor! Crossroads of Twilight resolves nothing, adds new characters and complexity to an already overburden story line, and repeats the cycle of endless misery for Rand and his companions. Not even one ""attaboy"" for cleansing saidin? Faile no closer to being rescued? Nynaeve and Lan ignored? No change in the siege of the White Tower? If this keeps up, the last book will consist of nothing but the resolution of all the outstanding cliff-hangers! It would be a great benefit to readers to close some of the open story lines and perhaps even provide some long overdue happiness to some of the main characters. The Eye of the World is becoming dull. I pre-ordered this book, but am hoping I can maintain the discipline to wait for the next one to come out in paperback. Less expensive; less disappointment."
1,Me -zzz Robert Jordan - $$,"I was smart enough to stop reading after the 7th book, when I suddenly contracted Narcolepsy and was advised by my doctor to stop reading Robert Jordan. My doctor had several other similiar cases and all were cured by this remedy. So no, I didn't read the book, but I can tell by several other reviews that it is another piece of crap, written solely for the purpose of making money. For a series to start out so great and promising, its downfall has been highly disappointing. It is comparable to the last two Star War's episodes which were also crap put out to make money. I despise authors like Robert Jordan and Piers Anthony who prefer quantity to quality. Unfortunately, I think this disease might be spreading after the similiar downfall of Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series.If you want to read exceptional fantasy, read Stephen R Donaldson or George R R Martin, if you like books that appeal to 10 year olds, keep reading Jordan."
1,Forgive me,"Yes, the book sucked. The last few books were equally disappointing. Yet, I did pre-order the next book. Forgive me. I'm weak."
2,The most boring of ten,"I have been absolutely glued to the entire series until book 10.Books 1-9, I give 5 stars each, but book 10, Robert seems to have written while on vacation. His mind was out to lunch. I think this is a case of author getting too greedy. The series was originally only supposed to be 6 books. He seems to want to milk this series for all it's worth, and this time he went completely overboard. The only remotely exciting thing that happens in this book occures in about 2 sentences, within 2 pages from the end of the book. If he doesn't come up with an absolutely spectacular book 11, I will be forced to abandon the series for lack of interest. I have been reading Sci-Fi for 40 years, and this comes close to the worst read ever, for an advanced series book!"
1,Another miss!,"With book 9 being such a disappointment and not progressing the storyline, I had high hopes that book 10 would get back to resolving some of the ongoing plots. I was very disappointed after reading this book, however. There are too many plots now and NOTHING seems to progress. You're bounced back and forth between them all and it's not until you reach the end of the book that you realize that nothing has been resolved."
1,please finish this bullshit,"Nine YEARS ago I stopped reading the ""Wheel of time"" series because I was getting seriously annoyed about the time it took Jordan to finish this work. AND HE STILL HASN'T FINISHED IT. Please, please, pretty please stop, mr. Jordan."
2,Disappointed Customer,"I'm a ling time fan of the Wheel of Time series, but this book has to be the worst. This book has little story of its own, mostly borrowing from the previous book, Winter's Heart..I will probably buy the next book when it comes out, but another book this poor will lose me as a fan of this series."
1,HOW DID THIS DISGUSTING BOOK BECOME A BESTSELLER????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????,"For the record, I did not purchase this trite scum on paper, I checked it out from my local library....but you fan-boy morons actually bought this garbage, WOW! This is the worst book EVER WRITTEN, I did not even finish reading it...IT TRULY IS DISGUSTING!"
3,Half a book,It's half a book is the best that I can say. I did not read the last few chapters and I will not read them or reread the book until the other half of the book is published
2,"ok, ok","In comparison, this book is highly aggravating for it's lack of any real ""action."" But as in rest of the series, there are several plot lines going on at once. All of the plots of equal importance while Rand's story has taken something of the back seat for the time being. If you will recall, during many of the other books, it has mentioned that without all of his friends stuggling through their own individual hardships, he will fail. Rand has always been a main character, more of a central character than the rest, but never THE main character. Although this book is quite tedious, there is still much of the neverending political intrigue which has been prevelant in Jordans writing since the begining. I enjoyed the book, but am begining to wonder if much of the unnecessary fluff was put in to help Mr. Jordan's growing addiction to the almighty dollar."
1,Review of reviews,"I once loved Wheel of Time. But around book 6 or 7, it became clear that Jordan has stopped telling a story. I haven't bothered to read more than the (90 page!) prologue of this one and leaf through the rest... bookstores are good for browsing. From the many angry reviews here, I can see that book 10 does not restart the story any more than book 8 or 9 did. So - if you MUST read it, wait for a used paperback copy to show up. I'm going to skip the next ten WoT books."
1,Yawn!!,"Yawn!!! Will this series ever get to the ending. I have honestly gotten very tired of the never ending story concept. I will not be reading any more of the series until all of the books are out, and even then I may just skip to the last one just to make sure it actually ends."
2,Who proof read this book?,"As mentioned by previous reviewers this book really drags and only the memory of the first books and hopes that maybe the next chapter will be better keep the dedicated reader slugging it out in the trenches. To make matters worse, not only is the plot slow, you are constantly slowed in the actual reading of the book by the multitude of proof errors. Very frustrating."
2,Stop trying to wring money out of us!!,"Please tell me if someone out there really believes that Mr. Robert Jordon does not have the whole manuscript in triplicate snug at home... I did enjoy these books, however I am about fed up with the 2-3 year gap between books! Almost half the series goes nowhere! Yes this is important info., yes I need to know this. Great. Why couldn't they put two of those go nowhere books together. I guess they wouldn't get 20 bucks a pop from all of us suckers who wait anxiously in hopes of not being disapointed, yet again. I find myself struggling to rember the last books and ambigious references to events in them. Normally I would re-read the series, but I find myself wondering why I would possibly want to waste the time when I could go read Anne Mcaffrey or someone else. I did enjoy this series in the begining, now it's a matter of seeing this thing through to the end... I hope that will change!!"
2,Why won't anything happen,I am truly getting very discouraged by this whole series. I spent half the year rereading this series in the hopes that something will finally happen. And nothing did! The synopsis on the cover sheet does a better job of telling what happens without having to read through 680 pages of fluff! I think Mr. Jordan needs to get back to the early books where he wasn't afraid to kill a few people. He keeps introducing characters but none of them ever go away and each successive books has to tell what happened with these other characters. I refuse to read the rest of the series until I know for sure the series is over
1,When's it kick in?,"As I turned page after page, I kept thinking, ""Ok, it's a slow, building intro, it'll get good soon."" Imagine my surprise when I turned a page and I was suddenly at the back cardboard binding! Actually, that particular page had more texture than the other 600."
2,the book of nothing,Just what i needed another wheel of time book that goes nowhere and goes there very slowly. What a complete waste of my time to have read this book. I will save you the trouble of reading it by saying you will know no more at the end then you do now.
1,"Drop this, read Martin.",This series is the equivalent of watching paint dry. I would also give books six through whatever minus five stars. Quit wasting time and money and read A Song of Fire and Ice.
1,Save your money,Buy this one at your library's used book sale. Don't spend more than a buck. That's all it's worth.
3,Three books of Exposition is Plenty!,"I'm torn. I'm one of the readers who have made a 10-year committment to this series. I understand that Jordan, one of the most talented writers to come out of fantasy in a long time, needs to put the characters in certain places, is all of this excruciating detail absolutely necessary? I mean, the plot has to advance here at some point. Some editing is definitely necessary.That being said, I'm really enjoying some of the psychology going on here. I like how each little group is trying to deal with the massive emanations of the One Power. I also like the plotlines of Perrin and Mat. That being said, I don't know exactly how necessary it is to tell me every time what Egwyne's choices of dresses are today. I'd probably give it two and a half stars, if I could."
2,Please make it stop...,"I really, really, REALLY wanted to like this book and desperately hoped some of the previous plot lines would be resolved. Alas, this is not to be and we the fans have been milked out of 20 more dollars and two years of our lives. Given enough time, a monkey in front of a typewriter will by sheer chance reproduce one of Shakespear's great works and that is what I'm reminded of here, although what we're getting is certainly not Shakespear quality."
1,Twilight -the end of a writer.,"Its sad that the end of a story is all twilight and fizzle, the first books and story was engrossing and whetted my mind. The need to end this saga by either starting four new books with the main players or just finishing the damn story and let the story end. I feel the author will die and we will never end this ""wheel"", but by the way he responds, maybe he is dead."
1,Where is Chapter 1?,"This is the worst of all the Wheel of Time books I have ever read and doesn't deserve to be published. Is Jordan or the Publisher after our money now, as the book was full of nothing, no story, no content, nothing, even the main character held 1 chapter at most to be honest? Jordan cannot be compared to Tolkien, as he was able to condense pages into words, and limit story lines and characters to keep the reader interested.Well, thats my moan about the book complete."
2,Sub par,"700 pages, thousands upon thousands of words, numerous characters, and various plots all get summed up nicely in this title.The book we have waited two years for was a dissappointment. To sum it up, nothing happens. The main story was not advanced in the slightest, it seemes that Jordan decided to use this book to let us know that he could milk this series for as much money as he wanted, and we would still buy into it no matter how mediocre it is getting.Sub plots were tied up, characters with little play in previous books get much more time on stage, yet... the book advances the storyline perhaps a week.We would have been better served by Jordan waiting another two years to put out a book that was worth the time it takes to read it."
1,WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG,"FIRST OFF LET ME SAY THAT I LOVE JORDAN'S WRITING STYLE AND FEEL THAT HE IS ONE OF THE BEST FANTASY WRITER'S TODAY, BUT I WAS SADLY DISAPOINTED WHEN I FINISHED THE 10TH BOOK. I LOVE THE OTHER CHARACTERS IN THE BOOK, BUT WHILE READING ABOUT EVERYONE ELSE I KEPT ASKING MYSELF WHERE'S RAND,AND WHY ARE WE GOING BACK TO THE 9TH BOOK. AFTER WAITING TWO YEARS FOR THIS BOOK, AND THEN FOR NOTHING TO HAPPEN, IM WONDERING WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG AND IF I WILL BE JUST AS DISAPOINTED WITH THE NEXT ONE"
1,One word - POINTLESS,"""Boring"" would be another great word to describe this book and if you want to use a phrase, ""waste of money"" would seem to do it justice. If you want a book 700 pages long with absolutely no movement in plot this is your book. This picks up where book 9 ends and finishes where book 9 ends. I hope Robert Jordan cares enough about his fans to move things along in the next one. Of course I seriously doubt I will be running out to get it after reading Crossroads of Twilight and either will you."
1,Who takes honey with their tea in the WOT world,"If you want to read 600 pages of detail about which Aes Sedai takes honey with their tea in the Wheel of Time world, what they have for dinner each night, how many weevils they have to take out of each night's soup bowl, then this is a book for you.If you are interested at all in books where the story makes even minor progress towards some climax, then I would say skip this installment of the WOT series.The story seems to be maybe 50 pages worth of actual story content, in between hundreds of pages of filler describing mundane details of the day to day life of WOT characters, some of them not even part of the main story that I could tell.I hope Robert Jordan quits wasting all our time with the next book, otherwise he will lose whatever WOT readers are left."
2,And the point is?,"I am currently on page 580 of this WOT book 10. I just read the following line:""And nothing at all had been decided except that more talk was necessary before anything could be decided.""That, in a nutshell, is exactly what this book is about thus far. Yawn."
1,Unblemished boredom,"I am halfway through book 10 and still have yet to read of Rand, who at one time I apparently mistook as a central character. But at least we have everyone's perspective of how book 9 ended, just over halfway into book 10. ""All that Saidar and Saidan, no one could hold so much and live, oh my."" Leading up to those repeated insights is like reading diaries of historical figures, recording their mundane thoughts about food, clothing, economy, politics, society norms...except these people do not actually exist and now neither does the storyline."
2,Treading water,"I really enjoyed the first Wheel of Time books. Then it started to deteriorate into more and more pointless and endless detail of dress, looks and what have you. In my opinion Robert Jordan is just milking his readers of as much money as he possibly can before he uses another ten books to begin the ending of the story. It is sad to see such a good writer wasting his own and his readers time in this way."
2,"No, not the worst of the series, just dull","I stopped buying these books several years back; just use the library copies now. Recently I was browsing and saw a new Jordan, checked it out, and was about 175 pages into it before realizing I'd already read it. There is one thing it does have one thing going for it: it is a fairly good synopsis of the latest events in the series. Do not, however, waste your money and only waste your time if you need a good soporific."
1,Another installment where nothing happens...,"What started off as a great fantasy series has now sunk to damn near unreadable. I barely got by book 8, had to mostly skim through book 9 and once again had to skim through book 10. Perrin & Mat are the primary foci of this book, yet nothing really happens with them either. Rand barely appears. Too many characters do appear in the book whose names I've long forgotten. The end is nowhere in sight, excepting that I think ""Crossroads"" has finally pushed me over the brink of giving up on the series.On a brighter note, I have begun to re-read The Eye of the World and am greatly enjoying it. I look forward to the re-reading the next six books, which were truly great works, but this time, I'll just stop there."
1,First book I ever returned,"This is the last Jordan book I ever buy. I'm at around page 100 and still in the Prologue. I don't recognize half the characters or plot twists going on anymore. I'm not about to go back 10 books to try and figure it out. This series started out great but has progresively gotten worse and now it's just obscene. This story could have been told in 6 books, probably less. I'm begning to believe that Mr. Jordan doesn't have an ending for this series and is just trying milk his cash cow for all it's worth.Someone needs to take his pen away and fire his editor. If I could I would have given it 0 stars."
1,Jordan should have stopped with #7,"Jordan has again diverged from the main characters. Mat and Perrin have some time but Rand is nearly non-existant. Prolonging the story, Jordan needs to get back to the basics, wrap up these characters stories and please do so better than the Taint wrap-up (too rushed) in the last book.Pick-up George RR Martin instead or reread the first 7-8 books of Jordan."
2,But nothing happens!,"I do not doubt that Robert Jordan is an excellent story-teller, but the effort is wasted here. The entire book of 675 pages spans but a month in ""real-time"" and advances the entire series not a bit. Save your money and skip this book, you'll miss nothing in the entire series. In fact, the galatial pace of the last three books makes me doubtful that this series will every come to an end. Not only is the pace slow, it is becoming ever slower.Instead, this book's many pages are devoted to various political intrigues, and endless profusion of proper names, and rich descriptions of everybody's attire. Personally, I'd much rather know what is going on in Rand's mind than a detailed description of every outfit he dons.Bottom line - I'm sorry I wasted the time reading it."
1,Extremely Disappointing,"I thought that maybe Jordan had revived himself after he actually had some interesting plot lines in Book Nine. However, I was just wishfully thinking since I have invested so much time and money in this series. There was virtually no advancement in the plot and he even had the nerve to throw in some stuff that sets the movement back. If you haven't bought this book, don't."
2,Where's the beef?,"Just like the old lady on that Wendy's commercial from years ago, I am wondering where the beef is in the burger. This book has the bun and all of the ""fixins"" but the main ingredient seems to have been left out, dropped on the floor, or stolen.I realize that this analogy is somewhat poor and rather drawn out... but so is this book.I don't mind having read Crossroads, but it is disappointing to have waited 2 years for the bun with no beef.... and have to go hungry for another 2 years until the next offering is served up."
1,Jordan get worse with every book,"It's really sad when a gifted author gets senile at a (relatively) young age, but that must be what has been happening to Jordan over the last 6 or 7 years.Each new book of the WoT series has less plot and coherence, wanders even more aimlessy , and just doesn't tell a 'story'The first 4 books where really good, although even then you could see a definite drop in quality from book 1 to book 4; but now, the story telling is totally lost.Save you money"
2,I wanted to believe other reviewers where cynical...,"But What. The. Frick. I'm all for rising action and tensions, but literally nothing worthy of note happens. Maybe it we bear out in the rest of them (I'm clearly too invested to quit at this point), but I really could have just skipped this book. It's hard to imagine Jordan writing this and anyone at all saying, ""Great job, Bob. You'll make even more fans with this one."" I would have given one star but I do like the series as a whole. As long as the next book gets better."
1,Massive Dissapointment,"This was in my opinion the worst book of the series. The book felt long while reading it and overall nothing really occurred to give any direction to the plot, it became a feeling of is it over yet while I was reading it. Basically just filler between books, and it was the once book in the series I didn't feel was worth reading."
1,IT'S TIME FOR AN END TO THE WHEEL OF TIME,"While I am an avid reader of Jordan's books, I've got to say this author seems to be milking this cow for all its worth. This book is over 600 pages with a story that could have been written in maybe 10. He should be ashamed of himself. He seems only interested in printing these books to make money, say nothing drag out the series and he'll make more money with each book. What's wrong with him!!In this book he repeats everything over again which he has said in the last 9 books. Worse, there's no story only detailed descriptions of places, it's like watching a movie with vivid landscapes, but the actors saying and doing nothing. Even worse is the constant addition of new characters who have minor roles, who Jordan feels compelled to tell us every little detail about how they look and what they are wearing, who cares ... stick with the main characters and the main story. ..."
1,Don't bother,"True disappointment - even though expectations were lowered by the glacial pace of the previous two or three books, this was a let-down. I agree with the reviewer that states Jordan needs a good editor - more than that, he needs an editor that is not afraid to put their foot down and strip out all the fluff and padding that exists in the past several volumes.Bottom line - bought it, read it and then promptly returned it. Not worth the price of a hardback - I'll probably purchase the mass market paperback when it comes out, just to have the collection up to date. Then again, I may not."
1,YAWN,"I waited 2 long years for this book to come out and was excited when I found out it was about to be published. After 100 pages I was depressed, after 400 I was bored and by the time I finished it I was angry. What happened to Jordan?? Lord of Chaos was the greatest book I have ever read. I read it in one sitting! I could barely struggle through 100 pages of Crossroads of Twilight at a time without falling asleep. This entire book could be compressed to one page and the plot would not suffer."
1,This is it?,"I can't believe I waited for this for two years. Enough for me, I'm finished with this series. Take away the ""Jordan verbosity,"" and you have an interesting trilogy. I can't sit through another five or six years of waiting and prequels to get to the end of this. Save your money. Find other ways to entertain yourself."
1,Boring,"If you like reading repetitive descriptions of women's dresses, want to know how many different things can be ""pale"" and care to know an appearance of every minor character (from hair, eye, and skin colour to a look on the face) then this book is for you.The drivel that is this book is a slap on the face to readers from Rober Jordan. You could have more fun watching grass grow for 2.5 years than reading ""The Crossroads of Twilight""."
2,Not very good,"I have not even finished reading this book, and I am not sure that I will unless I am extremely bored. This installment is slow, hard to get into, and just plain boring. In my opinion, nothing of great importance has happened for several books now in the Wheel of Time saga. I feel like the author is writing book after book simply to sell more books, rather than to add to the development of the story. Come on, if Tolkien can do it in three, why are authors such as Jordan taking 10+ books to develop an inferior story."
1,another lost reader,"This is really too bad. The first six or seven in this series were phenominal. The eighth & ninth were getting dull but I assumed Jordan was ready to start bringing together the hundreds of characters and subplots together. Instead he releases this book full of nearly 700 pages of nothing happening. What happened to all the great battles that the earlier books used so well?I am so dissappointed with this book. After reading book nine, I was disappointed, but hopeful. Now I am dissappointed and have no desire to finish this series. It had so much potential, and Jordan has let a potential masterpiece turn into a boring, dry and uneventful story."
1,Absolute Drivel,"What the heck? This book goes no where as others have pointed out. Jordan needs to have the story stick with the multitude of characters from the awesome first five books and STOP introducing new ones with every new book!!! Who cares one whit about Amyrilla and her party of stupid followers whos oppose Elayne? Jordan introduces them in one chapter, spends an eternity describing them, and then NEVER talks of them again. What the hells the point in this?? Stick with Rand, Matt, and Perrin and the girls. I don't care about poor Falion's plight. I am only half way through this book and wish I hadn't wasted my money. It almost seems like Jordan is no longer conscious of what he is writing and has completely lost the direction the original story was going. I am through with the series. I will make up my own ending in my mind!"
1,Where is the story,Yawn. The first Five books I spent day and night reading. I couldn't put them down. The pace of this series is so slow that I literally had to force myself to read this one. Since the 3rd book I've preordered every book. The next one I'll wait till it hits the bargain bin. Give me a break it took until the end of the book till Rand even showed up. What a joke. Jordan should be ashamed.
2,"So near, yet so far.......","Like so many of the faithful RJ fans, I eagerly awaited the release of COT, the 10th book in the series and had done reading it within 2 days of purchase. If I had to say one word to rate it - Disappointing!!!. Yes, in contrast to the last few books, he does deal with all the lead characters but as some reviewers have put down - there is no advancement in plot. In the published interview, RJ has said he hopes to finish this series in 2 more books - I just cannot see how that can happen without been a disappointment. But like so many others, I will keep waiting for the next one...."
1,I give up!,"I have continued to read the last several books in this series out a sense of obligation. I have invested so many hours on the previous nine and I usually don't give up easily. Crossroads did the trick, however, with countless long passages of little or no action whatsoever. I want to scream when I'm reading those endless chapters of Aes Sedai characters gossiping with one another! The central character in the drama, Rand, did not even appear until page 540! I blame Robert Jordan for abandoning the fans of an amazing series (up to Book 6 at least) and the editors and publishers for not caring about what kind of pulp they put out on the shelves. Please stop the comparisons to Tolkien as Jordan missed that boat about 2000 turgid pages ago."
1,Disappointed,"This is the worst book of the series. The plot evolved little - if at all. Initially this series was going to cover 8 to 10 books. Jordan needs to wrap it up. He can always do a sequel (or even better - a prequel). If the first book had been written at this pace, I would have never read the second."
1,A total waste of good paper,"The book stinks!!! Nothing happens, time seems to have stopped. Makes me wonder why I have read it. A total waste of time, paper and money!!! The plot is boring. No battles have occured. Nothing! With Perrin whinning all the time and Egwene doing absolutely nothing!) the only interesting scene was the conversation between Rand/LT and Logain. The only good thing that happened was the appearance of Loial. Also the attack of the windfinders should have been discribed. It would have made the book much better. So I think there is no need to read the book at alll - just wait for the next book to come (if there is a next book). I really hope for a better book. CoT is worse than PoD. RJ can write much better."
1,Don't waste your time with this one,"This book has got to be the worst of the series to date. Not only does the plot go nowhere, the writing is horrible as well. It feels like RJ has just copy and pasted sentences from the other nine books. His descriptions are the same old tired phrases that I've grown to dislike even hate. I often laugh while reading this book... not because it is funny but because i wasted my money on it. Go to the internet and read the Chapter summaries instead of buying it."
1,A contradiction of everything that has happened.,"Mr. Jordan lost his way long before. I swore after Path of Daggers that I wouldn't read any more. After recieving Winter's Heart as a gift I thought I was right until the end when at least something happened. So when a friend loaned me Crossroads I read it with something approaching optimism. How wrong I was.I called this a contradiction of everything that has happened. The Dark Lord actually used to be threatening. The forces of evil used to kick ... and take names. Our beloved characters were actually threatened. Nowadays I'm less concerned about armageddon then the characters just going into meglomania fugues.Jordan has lost it. He's just squeezing every dollar he can from us sad saps. I will forgive an author I love many things. But continually putting out swill just to fatten his own pocketbook crosses the line. This series has ended for me, not in glory like it was supposed to, but in mediocrity."
1,A Fork in the Road,"When it comes right down to it, Robert Jordan has made a choice. After writing the first 6 books of his series, Jordan realised that he had many loyal fans who would buy his next book(s) regardless of their content. Robert Jordan made a choice, between being remembered as the author of a great fast moving series of books that's main purpose was to please the fans, or, he could draw the series out as looong as he possible could, milking every dime he could from his loyal sheep. He chose the latter."
1,Like Path of Daggers with less excitement.,This is possibly the most pointless book I've ever read. It is 700 pages of eloquently written tripe that could have easily been compressed into 3 chapters at most. There is no action whatsoever and it somehow manages to end up in nearly the same place as the last book.
1,The Worst Kind of Anticipation,"As someone who eagerly awaited - and bought - Crossroads of Twilight, it'd be an understatement to say how disapppointed I was. Unfortunately what made Jordan such an engaging writer and the series so addictive - the vision, the attention to detail, the rich character profiles - is fast becoming his downfall. He seems to have become lost in the minutiae and is veering away from the central elements of the plot. The fault lies as much with the Editor as the writer; both are responsible for making a book readable."
4,Worth Reading,"So this book doesn't have a lot of the hack and slash, but it is worth reading. This book brings a lot of things together and ties up a few loose ends left in the other books. So no there isn't a lot of blood and killing, and at the times the book may slow down, but the way it is written is amazing. You just don't know what is going to happen on the next page and that feeling is worth it by itself. Great book."
2,In Jordans favor,"Ok folks,I'll admit the last couple of books have been a tad slow, but I have grown to honestly like these characters. It's kind of like getting a really long family letter every year or two. Jordan I believe also warned everyone that this would be a long tale simply by the words he uses to begin and end each tale about the wheel of time. I do not have a book in front of me and have forgotten the exact quote. You have to give authors credit for even writting one novel let alone a series of 10 thus far...I don't know anyone that after that many books would be fresh every chapter."
4,I thought it was good.,It is a typical robert jordan book. I have to admit that the first ones were the best but i enjoyed this one just not enough Rand. All around a robert jordan book.
2,700 pages of nothing,"It's amazing, Jordan can spend years writing a book that we all hope is bringing to a close the end of an age. Yet through the first 400 pages we discover simply what everyone was up to when Rand and Nynaeve were cleansing the male source. And the remaining 300 pages, a few political issues. No threads concluded, no threads even advanced. Skip to book 11 and you probably won't even miss what happened in book 10."
4,robert jordan's wheel of time,I found the book to be a good read but I was a little disappointed at the lack of plot resolution. At times it gets a little difficult to keep up with Mr. Jordan's epic cast of characters. If you have no memory for names don't buy the book. I look forward to when the next volume comes out in paperback.
4,Good filler book,"I've read through some of the reviews and agree with almost all of them. Yes, the positions of people didn't change much. Yes, the ending was anti-climactic. I personally was highly disappointed with the ending when I first read it. I also cried out ""NOTHING HAPPENED!!!!! ONLY ONE PERSON MOVED!!!!"" (Hence 4 stars.)However, if you read the series as a whole this book, to me, isn't meant to be a stand-alone book. Not every book in a huge series like this needs to be life-altering. I think of this book as a part of the whole and can't wait for the next one to be released. (I just hope it's action packed!)If you've read the rest of the series but you're worried about being ""bored"" and annoyed with this book, I suggest you get over it and pick it up anyway. If you've already read this book and hated it, I suggest you read it again with the mindset of ""so that explains what they're doing""."
4,Calm before the Storm?,"Now, a lot of people are saying that this Vol. doesn't match the quality of the previous books. So far as i can see, the quality is Fine.The real problem is that folk dont want to wait years between books, only for the book to advance the campaign plot just a few days.Strange as it seems, this is a Robert Jordan Novel that is actually Too short!"
1,Pure Drivel,I can not believe that this is the same author that wrote Eye of the World. This book is a complete flop. I spent 90% of the time trying to stop myself from ripping the book in half.
3,Stop speed reading,"I agree it's very wordy compared to the prior WOTs. Jordan uses much more very vivid, explicite and descriptive prose. I found it helped when I slowed my reading speed, and taste and chew every sentence, and try to visualize the scenes. Even then some paragraphs and scenes go on too long and are repetative, sort of like a Mojo JoJo speech (powerpuff girls reference). If you try to read quickly, it is definitely not a satisfying read at all.I'm still immersed in the WOT world, and will patiently wait for the next one. I do hope Jordan goes back to his original writing style and pace though. I don't want to wait 10 more years for this grand epic to come to a close..."
5,like a web,O.K. I pumped it up to five stars because I have a difference of opinion. It is easy to dismiss one or two books within a ten book series. I look at this series as a large web that Jordan describes in the book. Most of this book is set-up. I was disappointed like many in the lack of action but I see this as a contiuation to one giant story and not just one book. Call it a boring chapter. All books have them. I believe this series will have a great ending but I don't see it happening for at least three books. Too many characters and too many unanswered questions still remain...too many loose threads. You will buy this book regardless of any review if you have read the previous nine books.
1,This was not a novel,"It was an excercise in spelling strings of words that, while were syntactically correct, amounted to a negligible amount more than vaccum in deep space. Does it matter how many books in the beginning of the series I cherished, how I spent hours upon hours relishing the PLOT and the UNIQUE characters, how excited I got with cataclysmic EVENTS and sudden INSIGHTS on character DEVELOPMENT, or how the multi-layered plot lines almost DANCED in their PROGRESSION?In the end this is the singly most shameful release of a fiction book I have ever come across. I will not buy the next one until I get a chance to read it from the library."
2,Disappointing - but eager for more,"As an ardent fan who re-reads the series at least once a year this was a very disappointing volume.Much of the text summarizes historical info - a waste for anyone who has read the series. Perhaps the series is getting too long?Also, very little happens. I believe Jordan is a victim of multiple plot lines - we get chunks of info about Mat, then Perrin, then Elayne, and then Egwene before a little update on Rand. There is no connection - it is like pieces of 5 books slapped together.My suggestion - merge people together so you can cover some ground or put out separate books.I will get the next volume - I hope I am not disappointed again."
2,Ergh...,"What the heck was Robert Jordan smoking?! Half the book is going over what exactly happened during a moment during the previous book. Only one new plotline is introduced. This could have been cut waaaaaaaaaay down and made into part of the previous book. Seriously, this is only recommended for utter WoT junkies. Wait for the paperback."
2,What a let down.,"Well, I have read, and re-read the WoT series a few times, and I enjoy picking out little details that I had missed the 1st time through. Unlike many readers, I had no complaint about how the series may, or may not have dragged in the last few books. But this time around it was just too much. I can understand that the WoT is in reality just one massive book, but the details that just went on and on in Crossroads of Twilight made my mind numb. Where in other WoT books I've read with a hunger because Im enjoying the story, this time I found myself just skimming the pages in hopes that something/anything, of interest happening. Im sorry, but RJ blew it this time, if I have to wait 1/2 of forever for the next book in the line, odds are I wont buy it. Hopefully Jordan and his publisher will understand they let out a disaster, and will get the next book out rapidly to try to salvage the WoT."
1,Yawn,"OMG, I nearly DIED reading this book. I kept waiting for something to happen. I kept saying to myself that something would happen on the next page. I had to read the whole darn book just to make sure there wasn't some tiny bit of information to be had.Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Zip.It will be a miracle if RJ can rescue the story. I'm not sure I'll bother with the rest of the books. I know I won't buy them. It simply isn't necessary to have a separate SERIES for each character, which is what he has effectively done.RJ has lost control. I do not need several pages on what people are wearing. What I need is for the story to actually move forward.There are better books out there. Read them instead."
1,Pointless from cover to cover,"Some people have said that this book focuses on developing the characters rather than action, but all Jordan really gives us is trite navel gazing and the endless regurgitation of his limited array of character traits and descriptive phrasings (aparently all Aes Sedai share one collective hive-mind consisting mostly of icy stares and dress-smoothing). Nothing at all happens, you could probably just read the last few pages and get the same effect. I'm probably not going to finish the series after this, I can't blame Jordan for milking the series for a bit of money, but this offering of mostly filler is just plain insulting."
2,Crossroads of Boredom,"Now I have been a huge fan of the WOT series. Books 1-6 were absolutely awesome. After ""Lord of Chaos"" the series started to die down. ""Crown of Swords"" was an ok addition, ""Path of Daggers"" started the slow movement of the plot, ""Winters Heart"" almost brought the story to a standstill, but with this new addition ""Crossroads of Twilight"" RJ has brought the WOT series to an all time low. This book contained 678 pages of pointless detail. The highpoints in this book as far as im concerned were Mat's brief encounters with the Daughter of the Nine Moons, and Rands VERY brief appearances. To summarize you could read about three chapters of this book and still know enough not to be lost when the next one comes out. And since RJ is taking his sweet time releasing these you can expect the next one some time in 2007!!!"
3,A bit slow,"While I'm a huge fan of this series I must say I wasn't very happy with this book. After the long wait (as always) I was hoping to see how the story would advance from the ending of the last book. Well, it didn't, not much at least. With the characters as spread out as they are just catching up with each took up the entire book and then nothing really happened to any of them, just more of what they were doing at the end of the last book. There was a lot hinted at that could happen in the next book but that's about all this book was filled with, hints of what was to come.Being the fan I am of this series I know I'll be out there buying the next book, but not with the same hope that I had for this one."
1,Wake-up and Smell the Coffee,Anybody who buys this book must be masochistic. The last book was a joke on the faithful readers who invested much time and money on this series(i.e. 200 pages on Egwene getting the Nobles permission to travel w/ her army--what a bore!). That was enough to convince me that Jordan has lost touch with reality.
1,"Overambitious, self-indulgent drivel","Most of the other reviews I've read have restored some of my faith in human intelligence and literary savvy, and I am in full agreement with the consensus; this novel reeks of the self-indulgence of its author and offers very little to anyone but an incredibly narrow niche of readers with a penchant for underdeveloped, overly complex plots. This book labors over minutia that adds almost nothing to the story line, and the number of characters that are introduced or re-introduced is simply prohibitive. Brevity is the soul of wit, Mr. Jordan, and a better author could have (or perhaps should have?) compressed this book into 150 pages without losing any plot depth or detail that actually enhances the novel as a whole. It's a shame that the quality of this series has degraded so much over it's lifespan; the only reason why this review gives one star is that zero is not an option....."
1,Abominable,"Even given the ever slowing pace of the Wheel of Time books, I was staggered at the tempo to which Robert Jordan has managed to slow in this latest installment. If it wasn't for some of his stylistic hallmarks (or should I say mannerisms) I would even doubt that the first book and the tenth were written by the same man. And if the ending of book nine gave promise that the effort needed to persevere with the previous three or four books might actually be rewarded, as I progressed with book ten those hopes were quickly drowned in tears of boredom. Eventually I had to adopt a special reading style, which was more akin to scanning, in order to spare my mental faculties, but to be honest I think one could read this book upside down without missing anything of importance.It is a great shame that a story which started off so well should have come to this and I'm sorry to say that Mr Jordan has thoroughly lost the plot."
1,"impatient reader, ZERO STARS","Mr. Jordan, I hope you at least peruse these reviews because the WOT series has crashed like the stock market, book 10 has burst the bubble. I just finished it yesterday and it was so uninteresting. We really don't need to know the names of every character in the room in any particular meeting or whatever, those pages could be used for killing off some of those extraneous factions or getting more countries in line. It has become convoluted with all the side plot twists, there's so much going on that it will be difficult to tie up into everyone getting ready for tarmon gai'don, which should be a book in itself since it's supposed to be an epic battle. I'd hate for someone else to be finishing this series or for it to just be abandoned. I hope to see the next book out within a year, six months would be better. And, either get things going towards the end or start killing characters off without bringing them back so the plot can progress."
1,Is there a way to make this a negative star review?,"The series started well, tailed off, and now has the same literary quality as the back of a box of Cheerios. All the women are the same character with different names (and different dresses, we can't forget the dresses!). Nothing happens until the very end, and when something does happen it only opens up another possible storyline for books 11-56. If this series ends before triple-digit volume numbers, I'll be astonished.I refuse to buy the next installment."
1,Hasn't Robert Jordan Made enough money off this series yet?,"After reading the first book in this series i became entranced. I flew through book after book taking less than two weeks each. Then I hit book eight and it was like hitting a wall. I think it took me around a month to finish eight, nine and ten. The books didnt gradual become boring, they intantaneously became akin to watching paint dry. This might seem like exageration to someone who has not read the last few books however I assure you it is not. Jordan spent more pages describing the attire and the moods of every single character, no matter how insignificant, than on developing the story.Book eight was a major dissapointment to me, and when I finally finished it I prayed to god book nine would be better. But it wasnt, and therefore I prayed to god that book ten would be better. But it wasn't.In my opinion this series is only seven books long."
2,Crossroads of Mediocrity,"First, I have to say that it's well-written, with consistent characters.Unfortunately, it's well-written boredom. I waited impatiently for this book, and was rewarded with something I had to trudge through. Rereading it doesn't help. Rereading the series doesn't make this book any better - but it does make the rest of them look very good.I'll probably still buy the next book, because I do want to know what happens next... but I'm still very, very disappointed."
1,Pathetic..... ALL FILLER!,Everything that happened in this latest installment could have been written in two chapters. NOTHING HAPPENED!Robert Jordan has definitely fallen in love with his characters... and lost total sight of telling a story. He has probably a couple hundred characters now in this story.... so it is easy to see how he can write over 600 pages of filler/fluff/psuedo character development.Enough already! I'm not sure how he is going to salvage the mess he has created. He has turned one of (if not the) best fantasy stories into a never ending saga to create more and more characters. Enough characters already..... Mr Jordan needs to get back to TELLING A STORY!
1,Still standing at the Crossroads,"Believe the other one star reviews. Honestly, you could skip this book, read the next one and pick up right where you left off [from book 9]. I still think Robert Jordan is a good writer and his attention to detail is astounding, but that attention to detail is what's slowing the series down. I don't want to read a page devoted to describing how a person walks into a tent or what their dress looks like. Things that could be sufficiently summed up in a couple sentences are instead getting multiple paragraphs. Add to that weaving in new characters for additional subplots and our original characters are only in about half the book. One has to wonder if RJ is just prolonging the series for more profit."
1,2 years of waiting for horse [poop],"If I had the chance to meet RJ I'd have only one question for him... No, nothing about the charecters that were and still are great.. No, I'd ask him why I should even bother to continue to read this saga. maybe, Just maybe, if he took the last 200 pages of POd and the last 200 pages of WH, and nothing at all from this latest book, then maybe he would have came up with a book worthy of my money and more importantly time. The sad truth is we'll still buy the hard covers and make this clown more millions... I wonder if he has even read what he's been putting out... truly a sad case for what started off so brilliantly"
2,More characters and little substance!,"I have enjoyed this series since it started, but I should have catalogued all the characters Jordan has created in the previous books so I could understand who and what I am encounting in the newest one. He seems to be more facinated with creating more players and devsing neat names than telling a tale. With the long time span between novels it requires someone with great memory power to remember all the players and all the subplots. And this book is just a review of the activitiess of the secondary characters rather than an advance in the plot line. At this time, I am reading it more for commitment to a task than for enjoyment, and if the next one is just another ""run in place"" segment, I am not sure if I will buy it. I am losing interest in the series because it is becoming too long."
1,Disappointly SLOW,I must give this last attempt at continuing this epic tale a very low rating.The book drags on for over 800 pages and fails to tie up of the long threads of this very twisted plot and just goes on to add to more of the `pseudo mysteries' that plague this series.The descriptions of attire and scenery have become all too trite and contribute very little to furthering the main plot of the story.Disappointing and SLOW is all I can think to say of this episode of a saga I am beginning to get very tired of.
1,4 chapters stretched out to 600+ pages,"WoT, at this point reminds me of a puzzle from the Infocom text adventure Beyond Zork. At one point, the player character finds him/herself on a bridge. With every step across the bridge, the character moves at a decreasing rate, finding himself 1/2, 3/4ths, 7/8ths, 15/16ths, 35/36ths... of the way across the bridge but can never cross because he moves forward less and less with each move. The only escape is to leap from the bridge. With WoT, each book advances the plot less and less (this book actually moves backwards, starting with a different perspective on events before the conclusion of the last book - yikes). At this point, Book 12 will cover 1 day from the perspective of 100 characters and will consist entirely of braid pulling, sniffing, arm folding, descriptions of baths, etc... The only escape is to make a complete break from the series altogether (I know I'll never bother with it again) - the equivalent of Beyond Zork's bridge jump."
1,jordan wtf,"This was by far the worst book in the series to date. It felt like all of the characters were simply treading water and nothing new was happening. Not enough Mat, Perrin and Rand to satisfy me. Rand got a chapter and change; unacceptable. While reading this book i felt like Jordan was just trying make as much money as he could off the series by putting out a book where nothing really happened. I am also very tired of the whole women against men theme. Very weird/useless/annoying to have to read. Makes you wonder what kind of man Jordan is ^_^"
1,sad sad sad sad SAD,"Well, 2 things to note.1 - It's sad that Jordan mucked things up so badly. There's 1944 reviews on here that average out to 1.5 stars. Sad when the early books got 4 to 4.5 stars.2 - reading the reviews of people who hate what this series has become is better than reading almost any book.Now... all that hate has to come from somewhere.... where does it come from?OH YEAH I KNOW! IT COMES FROM ALL THE READERS HE'S BETRAYED!Finish this farce man! End it! Bugger the prequels and get on with finishing this series!"
4,Not for simple minded people,"I think that the 10th book was very well done. I noticed in a lot of the reviews that people were not happy because there weren't any big events or what not. This book was based on subplots, as another reviewer noted. If you stop and think about each little subplot you'll notice that they blend together perfectly. Some of the subplots relate so well that if you take a step back to examine them, you can't help but to admire the complexity of it all and the foresight that R.J. has."
5,Excellent!,"Everybody seems to be bashing this book. No one seems to think that anything important happened in Crossroads of Twilight. On the contrary, eveything that happens in this novel is absolutely integral to the story. With Crossroads of Twilight Jordan sets up the final part of this long series. The first 3/4 of the book essentialy brings the reader up to speed on the current whereabouts and situations of the main characters, and is quite good. The last part of the book is fantastic. It sets the stage for the consolidation of the peoples of Jordan's world, and the events leading up to the Last Battle, although it ends on quite a cliffhanger leaving the reader with a craving for more. This is definitely the caliber of book I expect from Robert Jordan. I strongly recommend this book to any who have followed this series, and I anxiously await the next installment."
1,At the crossroads,"This book is rated 1.5 stars. That's too high for trash like this. It hurts me a little to make that comment, being an avid WOT fan and all, but it's the brutal truth. By now whoever's reading this has probably heard about the flaws of this book so I won't go into great detail on the matter. Instead I'll just give a short summary of the problems: 1 dimensional characters, stalled plot, uninteresting scenario's and an overall sense of bordom are what make this book so terrible. Literally nothing happens. I don't care to speculate on why Robert Jordan's works have declined so much in quality over the past few years, it's really not important. The fact is once he was a great writer, now he's not. Like many of Jordan's long time fan's, I'll definetly think about whether or not I'll pick up the next book in the series."
1,Painful,"This book was truly a waste of time.. Very little happens to progress the story, go ahead and skip this one"
1,Is there a more boring book out there?,"To anyone who hasn't read this book, and is a Jordan fan :save your time and money, just wait for the next book. nothing happens in this book. Read it only if you have sleeping problems. Five pages before bedtime, and you are out cold for the night. This book should have been minimized to a couple of chapters in the series, not turned into a full novel.Mr. Jordan has failed spectacularly with this book. Maybe the next one will be better ( nah...)."
2,Read the cliff's notes instead,"Robert Jordan has created an immensely detailed world as a setting for this series. This book keeps you up to date on a daunting number of those details in the many widely separated venues he has created, spending several long chapters on each one. He does not resolve or significantly progress any of the plot lines, with the possible exception of developments with Tuon and a (truly) last-minute plot twist. The nearly 700 page tome could be summarized in about 15 pags of notes. My advice is to wait for book 11, and only read this one if you're a true die-hard."
1,Don't Bother,It is obvious that Robert Jordan doesn't have any passion for this series any more. Skip this series and pick up a real one. George RR Martin's Fire and Ice series puts this one to shame.
1,WASTE OF TIME AND PAPER!!!,"The truth about this book; you have a 600 page book that has about 200 pages of dialogue and 400 pages of superfluous description. Jordan really has lost control of his plot and his editors should know better than to let him get away with publishing this tripe. There is no character development, almost no plot development, no real storyline. The reader is introduced to a maelstrom of confusion and disjointed thoughts of the author. The simple fact is that this book could have been shorted by two-thirds and then rewritten to actually go somewhere, heck anywhere. Save yourself some money ignore this book and skip to the next one. Maybe someone will put Jordan over their knee and knock some sense into him. I've been reading Jordan since the late 80's when I was in high school. As of this book he has officially lost a fan. I will finish out the series because I'm hooked, but then will never read him again."
1,Outsmart the GREEDY BAS_ _ _ _,"It's plain and simple. Jordan is just too lazy to take the time to write a good ending to the series. He's also a huge sell-out and a GREEDY B (I mean, come on, who else charges for a prologue?). We are, however, somewhat attached to his characters.Easy solution: Borrow the book from you public library. You get to read the story; he doesn't get any money. So what if you have to wait a week or two for your library to get a copy. It's not like you haven't waited years for the series to do something .At one point, Jordan was thought of as Tolken's equal. Let's see how well his money consoles him when he realizes he gave up a place in Literary history for a few bucks that he'll waste before he comes back trying to sell us some more trash."
1,Ready to give up on Mr. Jordan,"I am ready to give up on Mr. Jordan and this series. The first 6 or so books in this series only took me about 3 nights each to read, 7-9 took me awhile longer. The 10th took me over a month to finally get through it. No action, slow slow slow. He actually seems to be stretching this line out for every penny. When he takes a half a page just to describe what someone is wearing, its time to move on to a new author. He is doing what drove me from reading Stephen King. Long pointless dialog. The editors need to get on Mr. Jordan to end this. When the next novel comes out I will be reading the reviews of it before I buy it. If everyone is complaining, I will be passing it up. Everyone should, just to give Mr. Jordan the message that enough is enough."
1,Slow train coming....,"Hi!This is not fun! i have been waiting for this book so long and nothing is happen. Almost 400 pages and nothing of Rand, just the actions of people i dont remember. i don`t know if i`m ever gonna finish this book.Boring!"
4,"Newest Jordan book embodies strengths, flaws of series","It is true that the series plot did not really advance throughout Crossroads of Twilight. Nonetheless, I found it to be an enjoyable read. Reading the 10th volume in the Wheel of Time series felt like catching up with some old friends I haven't talked to in a while. I enjoy hearing from them, even though not much has changed in their lives since the last time we talked. Jordan is indeed a very talented writer to be able to make 672 pages of pure exposition with no plot advancement interesting.In my opinion, Jordan has gotten bogged down. He has introduced too many characters and has gotten too attached to each of them. He is trapped in all this exposition and he can't figure out how to move the plot forward without dropping some threads. But he will have to. We can't hover on the brink of war forever."
1,Crossroads of BORING!,"I am extremely disappointed with this book. Robert Jordan has merely produced 700 pages of filler without furthering the story. It was not exciting. In fact, it was dull. The wheel of time did not turn at all with this installment. How much more nothing can I take? Jordan is just producing words to cash in on the readers that fell in love with the beginning of the series. ""There are neither beginnings, nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time."" How true..."
1,"Loyal fan, hoping against hope...","I too have been reading this series since the beginning. After finishing this book, I may not bother anymore. I definitely won't set aside the time to read the book before checking out the review - like so many have very limited time for pleasure reading, and this book was not a pleasure.Mat and Tuon were interesting, but do you think you kidnap the heir to the Seanchan throne and she just goes along with it? Someing just doesn't jive.Perrin and Fayle and Berelain - I don't even care anymore.I was frustrated when I was halfway through the book and realized that most of the plot entry points were BEFORE Rand cleansed the saidin. Come on, at least get FURTHER than the last book!No new characters until you figure out what the ones you have are up to! I would not recommend this book to anyone but the most hardcore Jordan fan, and it seems there are fewer and fewer of us.I will not buy the next one."
1,Bloody Hell Jordan!!!!,"Jordan has wasted another 800 hundred pages. After such a long wait for this book I was very disappointed when I finished it. The story has moved forward very slightly but it looks like Jordan needs at least another 10 books before we are any where near the end of this story. I suspect by that time even the dark one himself would have lost interest, never mind us mere mortals."
1,More build up,"First I would like to say that I had to give at least one star. I couldn't give it a zero. It deserves a zero. I can't give any plot points away, because nothing happened. Every character is in the same basic situation at the end as in the beginning. I think just about anybody could have written the same thing for this book. All of the characters go on a path that could have been easily skipped over as stuff that happened between books and did not need to be written. The only reason for this book to be out is so that the series wouldn't be forgotten. I doubt a good fantasy series like this would be forgotten. I think it would have been better for this book to have not been written. It was written and tarnishes the image of an otherwise very good series."
3,sigh...,"I had hoped for so much more....well, if one is following the series Crossroads must be read. Now i do not find Jordan horrible even at his most meandering. His prose is easy to read, so the book goes by quickly. I would have liked more content, but still the story does advance, if not enough. Maybe Knife of Dreams will blow us all away! Here's Hoping!!!"
5,Best Series Ever!,Once I started the first I was hooked on the whole sereies. Sadly Robert Jordan dies halfway through the last book. The books take a long time but are amazing
1,Boring!!,Don't bother to read it. You can skip the entire book and only miss one or two events. Or get the book from the library and read the last 30 pages.
2,Why should New Spring be any different?,It's been at least 3 books and 2000 pages since anything has actually happened to advance the plot of the Wheel of Time. Why should this book be any different?At least you can get these things really really really cheap if you wait 6 months and look on half.com.
1,He lost me after book 7,"Why do you all keep wasting good money on this puke? The series started out great and I hungrily read one book after another then the story got weak, then it got pathetic, then it just ground to a halt. The good news is I knew enough not to buy book 9 or 10. After looking at these reviews, I can see I made the right choice. So did the series finally end or is it still running on and on like bad case of diarrhea?"
3,Fair at best but probably needed due to the scope of work,"This book was fair at best. I think however that it was needed in light of the size of the story he created. Jordan may have created his own down fall by creating and tackling such a huge task. WOT is a major work and should be viewed as a whole. Unfortunately when 2-3 years pass between stories its hard to view as a complete work. I make it a point to reread the entire set before each new book so I can feel the continuity of the series. That being said I am disappointed by how little happened. The last two books feel like episodes of Friends to me. I say that because they're well written, nothing seems to REALLY happen in any one episode and this whole book wouldn't make 30 minutes of television. The issues that are discussed are left to be resolved later. We get to feel the backlash of the events of the last book. That was a nice touch to see that what happened WAS earth shattering and world changing. But it didn't develope past that point."
5,Wheel of Time,"While the series is long and some middle books are not as good as earlier ones, overall a very good series."
1,Just Finish It,"Like so many others before him Mr Jordan gets to a certain point in the story and begins to write fill. No substance just filling pages. I notice this with Terry Brooks as well. This is really unfortunate, as it kills the reading excitement and you begin to lose interest. I'm sure this is a money thing to stretch the story into as many books as possible, but enough already. It may be Mr Jordan's purpose in life to write this never ending saga, but it is not my purpose to read it. I'm finished with the wheel."
1,"For God's sake, get on with it!","I absolutely loved the first few books in the series. Then I started to get tired of waiting for some of the story lines to continue. The characters, after all, are so complex and have so much going on. So I got one book, then another, then another - and finally realized that Jordan is milking this for all it's worth! He's never going to resolve anything because he's making too much money stretching it out, and stretching it out, and stretching it out...... Could we have a little more action instead of pages and pages of bland, totally unnecessary descriptions and feelings, please? This is finally it for me. I will not buy another book of his in this series. I'll miss the characters, but it won't be nearly as bad as having to read through 100 pages of drivel per scene! Hey Robert - good premise, but you're losing it!"
1,Waste of time and money...,"I give up! I'm not going to bother reading another Wheel of time book until the series is complete (if that ever happens). I have read over 600 pages so far and absolutely nothing has happened. Actually, ""read"" is a little strong... I began skimming pages after page 300 or so.The first four or five books in this series were really good. Good enought to keep me, and many others, coming back for more. Even after reading THOUSANDS of pages of neverending gibberish, I had faith that at some point it would turn around. HA! The joke is on me!This series has become an absolute disaster. What a shame for something that had so much potential. At this point, I can't even imagine how Jordan will bring it to an end. For that matter, I have ceased to care..."
1,To 'Only for the enlightened',"I am dissappointed in the reviews which critizes those of us who dislike this book. I read a review titled 'Only for the enlightened' which refers to everyone who dislikes the book as 'simpletons'. To that reader, I would like to make a point. If you chose to actually read the negative reviews, its not all about readers whining about the lack of 'hack and slash' action. The readers are complaining about lack of closure, every expanding storyline, redundant details, useless details, lack of face time for the main characters, unbelievable storylines, storyline progression, character development,.....etc. Many of the reviews are different from each other and far from simple. Just because someone disagrees with your opinion does not make them simpletons....that makes you arrogant."
1,Wasted wanting,"When this book first came out in hardcover I waited...and bought the paperback. Now I'm really glad I didnt pay the exorbitant price of the hardcover. The speed of this 10th book is nothing at all compared to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd books.... it's slow! It all started going downhill for me starting from the 8th book. The characters are tedious now and although once I was fascinated by all the strong female characters in the series, now I'm tired of all their scheming and whining- the dirty looks... it's just plain annoying now. And I'm not even done reading the book yet! I find I'm having a hard time getting myself to finish reading the book. It's been so long since I've read the last book and who are all these new characters anyways?? It's getting too confusing and boring to read!I'm not sure if I will buy the next one... I think I'm gonna go and read the old ones again.. at least those books were fun to read!"
1,I'm tugging my braid,"This book stinks. I really enjoyed the series for the most part, although things started to seem pretty pointless in places beginning with ""Crown of Swords"". I thought the ending of ""Winters Heart"" was absolutely spectacular, and it really excited me about this book (the next in the series). However, this book was a total let down. It totally defused the climax of the last book since NOTHING HAPPENS. Ok, stuff happens, but it doesn't advance the plot, it just stalls it. Endless new side plots, worthless new characters.Personally, I don't care how long Robert Jordan takes to wrap up this series. HOWEVER, advance the plot, you jerk. If it takes five more books to tie everything together and end it, then so be it. But start tying it up. It's time to end side branches, bring people together, and stop introducing new characters and plot lines."
1,Don't bother,"I used to love the WOT series and recommended it to all my friends, but I can't recommend this book at all.Basically, nothing happens, the plot isn't advanced at all. You can basically skip this book and read the next one and not miss a beat, so why pay the money and suffer the tedium."
1,Just stop RJ just stop,"For the love of god, please stop writing! This series should have ended three books ago."
1,uhhhh,"I started ""reading"" this series of books about 2 weeks before Robert Jordan passed away. At that time I was on the second book and was disappointed that he wouldn't be finishing the story. I've however been more and more disappointed with the books since the 5th book and can barely stomach them now. I will continue to ""read"" them, actually audiobooks for me, until they're completed by B.Sanderson, the new author assigned to the story, in the hopes that he will be able to pull it all together. There are FAAAAARRRR too many useless, uninteresting characters and plotlines in this series. I think that someone could abridge the whole series to date into 3-4 decent books that would be more cohesive and better reading."
1,So disappointed,"Jordan could have wrapped this entire book up in 10 chapters or 140 pages and given everyone almost as much enjoyment to the reader, but I suppose he wanted 25$ from us instead. If you feel like spoilers, you could summerize EVERYTHING important in this book in 3 paragraphs.Basically 1/2 to 2/3 of the entire book encompasses what everyone else was doing while Rand was at Shadar Logarth and the other part was either non essential or boring. While detail in the Jordan WOT universe is a great thing, writing a book like this is not a good way for repeat customers.Will I purchase the next book, yes. Why? Because I hope it will be as good as all the books before this one.This book I own just to keep the collection whole"
2,Forced Moratorium,"A few of the other reviewers have it right when they mentionthe unnecessary stall. I would like to know how many booksdoes it take to get to the final battle. This one contained very little actionwith overextended plots to allegedly expand the characters who were presentsince book one, for those of us like me who read all of the nine previous booksit did little to do so.So what happens now? I must wait a year or a little moreto try and get reacquainted with Lord Goldeneyes or see howMat plans on taming Tuon? I am not sure if I will, thereare other books and my reading interest might suddenly change.This is taking too long."
3,somewhat dissapointing,"After waiting eagerly for over 2 years for this book to come out, i had a lot of expectations for movement in the plot line. I understand that Jordan has a lot of subplots going on also, but nothing happened in the major plotlines. After the excellent cliffhanger in book 9, i was expecting so much more from this book. At the very end of book 10, he finally makes a little movement in the plot. Also, i was not liking the women in the book. they were no longer characters, but were just sounding like a bunch of steryotypical women, very dissapointing. although i am definitely going to buy the next book, there were just too many options for where the plot could have gone in book 10 that he just did not even address, and if he does not start picking up the pace in the next book, im moving on as much as it will hurt me. if i werent so intrigued with ""randland"", i would just give up now."
1,680 Pages of Pure Fluff,"You keep thinking Mr. Jordan is going to see the error of his ways and wrap this series up but he continues to provide us with nothing but non-contributory plot fragments and an ever-increasing list of ""never to be seen again"" characters. I struggled through the last few books simply because I remembered how good the first 4 were. The time has come to bring this series to a close. It saddens me to see the pure genius of his eary work degraded into material to make himself a buck. Mr. Jordan you have ruined a fantastic series with your greed."
2,Slightly better than everyone is giving it credit for,"Let me start by saying that this might be the most anti-climactic book I have ever read.That said - I enjoyed reading it anyway.I like the characters, the setting and the storyline, but of the 680 pages, the only relevant ""action"" was in the very VERY end. As long as you are prepared for that the book won't disappoint you TOO much.I wasn't prepared for that though, so 2 stars it what it gets.Anyway - I will stick with the Wheel of Time series to the end for one main reason - books 1-3 might be the 3 best books I ever read, and I've read quite a bit of fantasy.(Wizard First Rule & series, Rhapsody & series by Elizabeth Haydon, George RR Martin etc.)In short - don't expect much and Crossroads might exceed your expectations. Barely."
2,"Please, Mr. Jordan, finish the series before you lose us all","I am a big fan of the Wheel of Time series and loved the first 8 books. By book 9 I was beginning to wonder, ""when is this all going to end"" and book 10 does nothing to help get any closer to a conclusion. As Mr. Jordan continues, his stories are becoming less and less interesting and one is left disappointed. Though there are some good parts, much of the book is quite tedious and since it's been so long since the first book, it took a bit of time to remember everyone this round! Please, Mr. Jordan, let's move on to the final battle and finish the series before we lose all interest."
1,"Arr, it blows!","I have to admit that I gave up on this series after book 5 (I think it was). It became tedious, and it sounds as if it's only gotten worse. There are many more interesting books to read out there. I do have to say, though, that I've really enjoyed the reviews. As an earlier reviewer mentioned, this could be the birth of a new art form :) I can't wait until his next book is published and can only hope that it garners reviews as entertaining as those for this book."
1,How can you retire well as an author?,"The best way is to keep your climaxes long and drawn out. Jordan has managed to do this over the last three or four books now, and he shows no sign of lessening the pace. Of course, he does this by stopping all action is his books and splintering the story off into a dozen or so fragments so you have to buy all twenty of his books to get a complete story. He's discovered how to avoid the weakness that develops when you have a set of novels set in a fantasy world:some people can't be bothered to buy all the books---they just buy the ones that interest them. By sticking all his novels together, he can make you shlep through all 7,000 pages or so. Great marketing, anyway."
1,Boring,Just plain boring. Nothing happens. And the women sniffing and straightening their skirts drove me mad. No woman does this! Where did Jordan get this idea? I have read the next book in the series and it is better. Whew!
1,Not again!,"I've actually come full circle with this book:I borrowed book 1 from a friend, and loved it, so I went out and bought a copy, along with books 2-7.Books 8 &amp; 9 I bought in a secondhand bookstore, as I was starting to become jaded with the series.With Crossroads, I've reverted to simply borrowing it from a friend again, only this time, I have no intention of paying for my own copy, because I don't think I'll ever be re-reading it."
2,A disappointment,"The first five or six books of this series were so good I couldn't put them down, but the last couple have been so bogged down in details that they are boring. This whole book could have been a single chapter. The plot did not get moved forward at all, there was no action, basically it felt like an attempt to make the series even longer and make more money. I want to finish reading this series, but it's becoming tedious to read. Get on with the story already!"
2,A Major Disappointment,"Until I read this book, Robert Jordan was my favorite author (well, in a tie with George R.R. Martin) and I LIVED for the next Wheel of Time novel to come out.This one was like a short visit with old friends, but it was 700 pages of useless ""chit-chat"" There was no action, no adventure and only VERY minimal plot advancement.I can't believe that I waited two years and had it on pre-order for a year to read this. Don't waste your time and energy or money on Crossroads of Twilight unless you are an absolute Wheel of Time junkie..... Better to just re-read the earlier books."
2,"Ok, now I really feel like an ... ...","Ok, HOW long did we wait for book 10? 2 YEARS? This book went almost no where. Jordan is filling pages and pages with pure fluff. Having waited for this book for that entire time, I feel like I just got my chain yanked. Aside from a few major decisions being made, Jordan spends his words describing filthy clothing, and or just TALKING about clothing clean or not, for a great percentage of the book. Lots of describing scenery, and background, but little on plot devlopment and progression. I am very dissappointed with this book and it is starting to color my overall perceptions of the series. I hope he gets back to what he gave us in the first few installments, and I will likely ready whatever he may produce in the WOT in the future, but I won't be anticipating it or holding my breath."
1,Disappointing,"I feel that I have been taken advantage of on this one. Less happens in the almost 700 pages of this book than in 20 of any other. No science fiction, no important political setup, no suspense, no resolution of any issues. My feeling is that Jordan does not know how to tie up all of the loose ends he has created and is stalling for time. My advice is - don't even get the paperback. Go to your local bookstore and read the last 4 pages. This book is a waste of good reading time and I will be sure to read reviews of the next before buying it."
1,The local library...,"I urge you not to buy this book. It seems RJ has decided to prolong WOT indefinantly. I found myself skimming most of this episode, searching for a glimpse of interest or a glimmer of plot advancement. It seems RJ has run out of ideas and decided to bore us senseless. The book focuses on Elayne and her strive to attain the crown - probably the most uninteresting part of the whole series. So, check it out at the local library but don't waste your money on it."
1,Rand might as well die now. The last battle is never coming,"Have you noticed that since book 5 or so, nothing happens in the first 500 pages of the book? Well book 10 takes it one step further; nothing happens in the last 200 either. The one factor that kept me reading The Wheel of Time to this point was the fact that each book ended with enough action to propel me through the next 500 pages or so of setup until I reached the climax of the next novel. I don't think this will be enought to get me through another novel, however. I may read Robert Jordan's series again one day, but I'll probably read the first 5 books and skip to the last one if I do. File this one under tedium and save yourself the trouble of reading it."
1,Booooorrrringggg!!!!!!!,"When I finished the first three books and the story had not ended, I thought, ok, this is a little unusual for the genre, but great, let's break some molds with a fourth book! Then the fourth book hadn't ended the story, then the fifth, and so on... It stopped being interesting somewhere around book five, although I've read them all so far - I keep convincing myself that the next book will be the last! And it never is! It's like a 30 minute sitcom that doesn't end after three hours. I think I'll drop it with this one, and give it up. Maybe in ten more years he'll have finally figured out where the story is going, and I'll borrow them all from the library. Or not. He has to have the best author's contract in history."
2,Puh-leaze!,"I was hooked after reading the first book of this series. The plot moved quickly, it was interesting, the characters well fleshed out. The excellent writing continued for several more books. Mr. Jordan, what happened to you? The last two books are dead in the water. NOTHING, I mean NOTHING interesting happens to the story or the characters! What is the point of writing two entire books which do nothing to advance the plot? Set-up is good and necessary but only the amount of set-up which is relevant and assists the reader. I am extremely disppointed that I just read an entire book in which no plot advancement occurs. I'm sure I'll keep reading, because I do want to know what happens to these characters in the end, but let's get a move on, here!"
1,I'm glad that I used the Library,"Truly, RJ is drawing this series out for all that it is worth. What a bore as compared to the very interesting first few volumes. If there is a #11, I'll check this one out of the Library too, assuming that I read it at all.Frankly, I'd rather read Robin Hobb, J R R Tolkien, George R R Martin, Terry Brooks, or Stephen King for Fantasy."
1,This Book was a waste of time for the readers and author!,"I am a big fan of the Wheel of Time saga, however, this volume added nothing to the story. I just finished reading the book and I feel that it was a complete waste of time! I thought the Prologue chapter of the book was good, but, in my opinion, it was the best part, and the story went flat thereafter. In my opinion, there are at least 400 pages of ""nothing"" in this book. I enjoyed reading the previous 9 volumes and I hope volume 11 is significantly better than volume 10."
1,haha,"All right. This book stinks. You know, I think that bashing the tenth WoT book has become something of a favorite activity of Robert Jordan fans/Wheel of Time fans. Muahaha. It certainly has for me. I mean, it's all meant in love, you know...I'm a great fan of this series, but when Bob writes an appalling tenth installment....you have to teeeeelllllll him that, and once enough fans have yelled at him, he can say ""oooooh, you DON'T like it when the whole book is full of tea parties and emotionally unstable women's rantings? OOooookaaaayyy"".....thankfully he improved on book 11."
1,"Yada, yada, yada","No need to expand on the other negative reviews that have already been written, this tome took us nowhere fast. If RJ's not careful the WOT series will turn into a Goodkindesque type of literary quagmire where the author keeps milking the same tired storylines without advancing any, at least until the faithful readers finally give up on the whole quest. The question that really needs to be asked now is whether or not RJ can finish what he started and move on to the sequel instead of the prequel? As the wheel turns so shall we see (hopefully before too many ages pass)..."
1,Balefire Jordan!,"CoT was so slow, boring, and bad that I now wish I had never started the series. Robert Jordan took a good thing and is milking it for all it's worth. I definitely reached a crossroads after reading this book and I'm choosing not to read any future installments."
1,Jordan is milking it!!!,The last three books of this series have seemed like 1 hour episodes from a tv series!! Like 3 things happened in 700 pages!!It was an easy read and really annoying waste of time. You can skip over this book and you will miss practically nothing. I dont know if I'm going to even bother reading any more of Jordan's books until he finishes the series. Because it seems to me that he'll die off before he gets the chance!!!-irritated reader
1,Marching in place...,"You will miss absolutely nothing by skipping this book. *Absolutely nothing*. I like 'background' very well in a storyline, but this is over 600 pages of background and not one thing changes by the end of the book. I will continue to use the library until Jordan produces something worth purchasing, and I recommend the same for others. Then again, maybe the fan sites will do their usual (excellent) summaries, in which case you'll save yourself time as well as frustration by skipping the book altogether and hoping for better in the next."
3,Too much of nothing,"Once again, Robert Jordan proves he can develop characters and subplots for 1000 pages, while not actually accomplishing much of anything in the overall story line. This whole book could have been condensed to a couple of chapters in a larger book in which SOMETHING ACTUALLY HAPPENS to move the plot along.I don't think I will even buy the next book until some other people read it and tell me if anything actually goes on."
1,Terrible!!!!,"I was completely amazed at how very little Jordan actually developed the plot in this book. In seven hundred pages Jordan progressed the development of his series by only a few days!!!! Nothing changed from the end of the last book. No action took place and the main characters actually did not accomplish a single goal. In fact, you would not miss anything by skipping this book altogether and waiting for the next. Given his last several books I would strongly suggest that those desiring to discover the outcome of the series should get each of the final books at the library when they come out, find a nice couch in the facility, and read the last couple of chapters. You will not miss anything whatsover by doing so. In fact, you could skip this book altogehter and read the summary provided by others and you will not miss a thing!!I would give this book zero stars if that was a possible choice. While I have read all ten books to this point, I am certain that I will not read another!"
1,I give up,"I've been following this series for years and was vastly disappointed with the last few. *This* one however, says nearly nothing for 680 pages. The worthwhile parts could be compressed into 80 pages. Pages and pages of comments on clothes, the scenery, looks, thoughts and *nothing* happening.Two possible reasons, possibly a combination of both:1 ) RJ has painted himself into a corner and doesn't know how to get out yet.2 ) The resolution is closer than we think and RJ does not want his revenue stream to end and is deliberately stretching it out.Myself, I refuse to buy any more of this series until it is complete. At this rate, I'll be buying books in 2050."
1,Absolute garbage,"The only thing Mr. Jordan has become the master of is fleecing people of their money. A series of books that should have been done in 4 books has been dragged out to 10 with no end in sight. Mr. Jordan is not a good writer, just one who has stumbled onto a good idea and has managed to waste that as well. He has seen the last of my money."
2,"One step forward, fifteen steps sideways","I have been an avid reader of this series for many years now, but I must say that this was a big letdown from the previous novel. Sometime around book number 6 or so, Jordan seems to have become mired in a rut where one book advances the plot and then 2 years later another book is issued descibing all the semi-interesting things that were happenning around the same time in other parts of the globe. I understand that there are only so many Forsaken that can be killed off before the series gets dull. However, given the delay in between novels I cannot think of a good reason why every book should not advance the plot. This book was one huge setup for events down the road, and there was simply no payoff. I would reccommend treating Jordan the same way that Star Trek movies are perceived; skip every other one so that you are not frustrated!"
1,so sad,"To restate what many, many others have already said, this book is incredibly disappointing. I simply could not get through hundreds of pages filled with minor, forgettable characters and no plot advancement. On the strength of the earlier books, I had continued to read the series despite its flaws. With this latest addition, I've decided I no longer care to see how it ends."
2,"Worst in the series, but you should still read it","The other reviews on the site really speak for themselves; however, I did want to put my 2 cents in. I would not say that I hated this book, but there is zero plot development. The pace is slow, and nothing is resolved... all of the characters are literally in the exact same situation at the end as they where when the book started.That being said, DO NOT loose hope on the WOT. The upcoming books are MUCH better, especially 12 and 13. I look at book 10 as a ""bump in the road"" to an otherwise great, epic series. Don't stop reading, there is a light at the end of the tunnel!"
1,Awsome series...............what happened?,"I first began reading the Wheel of Time series after it came highly recommended by a friend of mine. To tell the truth I loved every book in the series (1-9) but then came book ten. For others who have read the rest of the series I can see your dissapointed also. No main conflict was ever resolved but instead dragged out. The ""Rand chapters"" of this series were my favorite, the ones where all the action and story devolpment took place. This novel had only 2 chapters devoted to Rand and over half the book to meaningless Aes Sedia parts. I was highly disappointed in this book. How can Robert Jordan bring himself to write this?"
1,Waste of time!!!,You can skip this book and read Book 11 when it comes out. Unfortunatley if this book is an indication you should probally wait until book 12.....In the meantime read Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series. Events actually happen and charachters actually do something!!.
3,Haven't Read this,"I was a freshman in college when I first read this series. That was..lets say....1993-94. I am nearly thirty years old now. I read up to the book where Rand puts the Aes Sedai in their place and haven't read any of the books since. It became obvious to me at the rate and complexity of what he was attempting, it would take at least 15 books. So I refuse to read another. One day, when the end is finally reached, (i'm thinkin I might me 40 by then IF I am still alive) I will go out and buy all the books in the series and put aside two weeks or so to read them. im sure it will be enjoyable. But in the meantime, I refused to be toyed with. I just hope he doesn't end up string us along like Steven King and the Gunslinger series. King started that in the 70's and just now finished. (aww shucks, I hope robert jordan doesn't read this and get any sick ideas.)"
1,Good by Robert Jordan... it was fun... 'till now.,"After nine books I was hopeful that at least one plot line would be resolved. I was so disappointed and disheartened I couldn't even bring myself to complete this book much less invest my time or money in book 11. Sorry Jordan, that's it for me. (As a side note, I noticed this book in hardback and book 11 in the `super bargain shelves' of B&N and Walden's for less than $5.00)"
2,Please Lord Jordan Help Us!,"If you are a big fan of Robert Jordan's last four books in the Wheel of Time series then the 10th installment is right up your alley. However, if you thought the pace was gruelingly slow in those books you might want to know that Rand al'Thor doesn't actually come into the book until around page 530. Please, write to Jordan and tell him to stop dragging this out even more. NOTHING HAPPENS, NOTHING AT ALL. I can't stress that enough. Read the dictionary, at least every once in awhile you find something exciting in there."
2,Wheel of time fell of it's axle,"ONE reviewer suggested he was going to send his book back to Tor. What a frigg'n great thought. I'm all for it! Lets all pack our books up and send them to the publisher. I bet Book 11 will have Mat and Perrin married to eachother, Faile getting her groove on with her would be suitor, A two rivers bow breaking, and Rand have bed spring olympics with all of his ladies. The Shaido will learn to break dance and Elaine and Elaida will have a tag team mud wrestling match in two rivers wool for control of the tower."
1,There's a problem with this novel people are not addressing.,"I see a lot of the people who liked this book saying ""Guys stop complaining, Robert Jordan's just setting things up!""Yes, Robert Jordan partially has been setting things up for about 4 books. This is true. But these last four books are also suffering from an egregious amount of PADDING, padding that has nothing to do with setting up a plot.For example, when the Aes Sedai meet, it takes them 4... pages just to sit down. Four long boring pages?! Is this necessary?This book is just chock full of useless details that have been repeated ad nauseum since Crown of Swords. If you want to hear about Aes Sedai breast size to the most pedantic minutae, or if Nynaeve yanking her braid ten times in five pages fascinates you, or you want to read about Egwene crossing her arms beneath her breasts, or any number of oft-repeated and useless details, then by all means, read this book."
1,Jordan has de-railed...,800 pages with no real plot advancement. Deeply dissappointing...it's almost as if Jordan himself is lost in his own story and has no idea where to take it at this point...
1,Holy sucky soap operas Batman!,"I just finished Jordan's latest installment and I must say, it's the most disappointing book I have ever read. I'd suggest a Cliff Notes version but if you distilled the endless drivel down to substantial events, I'm not sure if you could even fill ten pages. Heck, if you took all the ""<fill in the name> straightened here skirts"" phrases out, you'd drop a hundred pages right there.Yes, Jordan is a very talented writer and I enjoyed earlier works in this increasingly dissapointing series. And, yes, I'm sure it will have a fantastic ending. But, I must ask... What in the world did he readers do to deserve this abomination?Jordan, if you're listening to your readers... End it already!"
1,Sickening,The plot progression was worse than a bad TV soap opera. The book was nothing but filler. As a one time fan of the series I am deeply disappointed with this pitiful effort to stretch out the series to more books.
1,Disappointment,"I read the first three books and then waited with baited breath for each new installment. Unfortunately each installment now takes longer and is more disappointing than the previous one. Crossroads of Twilight is thin on plot and thick on the filling. Robert Jordan appears to be stretching the story out to breaking point, probably in anticipation of the royalties from each book. Unfortunately it seems the less substance he puts into each book the more fans fall by the way side. I would borrow this book or buy it second hand because it is certainly not worth spending your hard earned money on. Lets hope Jordan learns the error of his ways and starts displaying the brilliance that had us all enthralled at the beginning of this epic."
1,Crossroads of boredom and frustration,"What a bone-grinding halt to such an exciting (all beit falling off) series. Reading this book was like watching a soap opera. Plenty of detail and filler, but when you're done with it, you realize there was absolutely zero plot movement in the entire book.Can't believe Jordan can write 680 pages of material and describe nothing of consequence. I had read more than half the book until I got an update on the main character. Then guess what happened with him... That's right. Nothing. This series is quickly going from the best I've encountered to the most disappointing.Next time TOR and Jordan will have to earn my money with a few good customer reviews before I buy. Please quit selling me filler."
1,Crossroads of Twilight,"Robert Jordan's last book has helped me in two areas. The first was to improve my speed reading; I only had to read every 10th page to understand the plot. Second was the security that I would be saving money in the future, this is the last time I will be duped into buying another one of his books. It's hard to understand how an author could start out so interesting and end up so boring. I wonder if money has anything to do with it?"
4,LeeLee,"It's a comfortable shoe, not made for women with wide feet. Lightweigt and suitable for work or play."
5,Excellent talent,"This is an eclectic mix, from Hawaiian traditional to Jazz classics, & James Taylor styling. This young artist is exceptional, with an interesting bio - I don't know where his career has led him, but I would love more of his music. I first heard this recording about 5 years ago, on a trip to Hawaii, and have almost worn out my tape!"
4,Curious Buddies - Farm,"This Curious Buddies DVD is a cute one. It's mostly geared to the younger children, helping them identify the sounds animals make on the farm. Cute music. My daughter loves the duck song! :)"
5,Cute movie!,"This was a nice change of pace. We usually buy the baby einstein movies, but my son was so into animals I bought this. He loved it. He just laughs and names all of the animals and foods. I would say this movie can be watched by kids older than 18 months."
3,WRONG COLOR,THE BRA IS GREAT BUT IT WAS NOT WHITE. IT CAME IN ICE BLUE. I DIDN'T WANT TO GO THROUGH THE HASSLE OF RETURNING IT SO I JUST WORE IT.
4,Good support but itches,"I was hesitant about purchasing a bra online but I decided to try it anyway. Shipping was prompt and like most things I buy online I tried it out right away. The bra provides good support to my size 40DD girls. I wouldn't go to Zumba class wearing this bra but the girls feel like and stable in the cups. There is no under wire but the wide bottom band keeps my girls in the cups and not against my skin. This has been a problem with other bras and resulted in a heat rash. I don't see that being a problem with this bra. It is also a plus that it is a front closure bra, although you won't get as much wear out of it if your band sizes changes any because there is only one set of hooks. The straps are very comfortable and do not dig into my shoulders at all. I did knock off one star because the side bands starting to itch like crazy a few hours in to my day. I plan to keep this bra but the search continues for the one."
5,Really helped me to ace Accounting 101,"I bought Standard Deviants Accounting Part 1 and watched it several times. If I was smarter and used less drugs earlier in life perhaps I could have watched it fewer times. Anyway, I aced accounting 101 and got a recommendation from my teacher who was an IRS accountant to tutor accounting 101 at the community college."
4,Great second half,"I haven't done much reading in the area of thinking. This book has in fact sparked my interest there and I plan to read more in the area. The second half of this book has a tun of insight from research that is from the 70's. It's interesting though how the research about learning/thinking doesn't seem to have progressed to far to make this book seem dated. It seems cutting edge still. All I know is that I learned some extremely valuable items from this book and I want to continue down the path some more. More importantly, my desire to learn in other areas has also been inflamed.I have given this four stars because the first 150 pages is just about doing well on IQ tests and only has one relevant item that is applicable to everyday life. Forget the first half, just read the second."
4,Good but sad...,I read this because the reviews were really great and all the reviews I read stated it was sad but had a happy ending. I think it depends on how you define happy. I thought it was a super sad ending. Real though. I would totally recommend this book to others.
4,Childhood recalled,"Was given this book by my first grade teacher when she discovered that I could read. At that time ( at that age) I was transported by it--- mystified, enlightened and in the end, devastated. That was at a very young age, in a different time, a different world. Someone reading this book for the first time as an adult today might easily wonder how a child might have reacted to it as I did."
4,Dog of Flanders,"Poignant, sad yet beautiful. I read this book over 60 years ago as a child. Life was harsh, yet love prevailed."
2,"Not for young children, because it is too sad","This book may be a classic and enjoyed by many people, but it has many very sad parts. It also has a heart breaking ending. I would not recomend it for young children."
5,"Thogh I have known this story long time,","Though I have known this story long time for 25 years or so, it was from animation. So it was different from waht I know. Basically it was same and I found the more details but I also foud some conflicts. Johan was 80 years old when Nello was 2 years old. His mother was very old or Johan was very old when he got his daughter. Nello died when he was 15 but animation was much younger. The problem I see is 15 years old boy is old enough to live by himself 100 years ago ( I might be wrong). Anyway setting of age is kinda wrong. By the way I read a book which is published in 1910 not this book. If this book is different, please let me know."
2,Fails to portray any greatness in a great pioneer of cinema,"Meade paints Keaton as a pitiful man and never seems to get at the heart of his passion for the cinema. The only emotion I felt towards Keaton, one of my personal heroes, after reading this book was pity. I don't recommend it for anyone who has never previously read anything about the Great Stoneface."
2,Why was this written?,"Seems odd to write a book about someone of whom the author does not seem a fan. Not only is the tone entirely loathesome, it is riddled with fabrications and loosely based hear-say. Not only was it poorly researched, it seems as though in many areas the facts were blatantly overlooked, omitted. The author quickly loses credibility with anyone who has access to verifiable facts about Buster Keaton's life.This book was a peculiar waste of time and energy for the author, and more-so for any potential reader.The beautifully done (and seperately researched) discography is the only reason this book received two stars from me. (Borrowing it from the library will clear one's conscience, if one needs access to the thorough discography.)"
3,pretty good...,"this book seems pretty thoroughly researched and the author seems like an intelligent person... the writing is not very good, though, and the tone is kind of cold throughout... overall, a good read, though, with a great deal of information... the lobster recipe is really tasty too..."
1,Poor research.,"Why did Ms. Meade write a book about someone whom she clearly dislikes?More importantly, why did she write such a poorly researched book?AS soon as I read that Keaton was 'illiterate' I knew that this book was not a keeper.(Buster Keaton kept a diary when he was seven years old, and wrote screenplays when he was an adult. Any biographer can check this out.)And any reader can purchase a much, much better biography of Buster Keaton. THE MAN WHO WOULDN'T LIE DOWN or KEATON are both superior to this one."
1,Perfectly dreadful!,"It's really a shame that Keaton's 100th birthday was marked by the publication of a book that tries so hard to shoehorn him into the stereotypical Sad Clown mold...Ms. Meade does her best to portray him as a dysfunctional, unhappy, frozen, remote, illiterate wretch, when in fact he was none of those things. The illiteracy allegation is particularly foolish--how could a supposedly meticulous researcher have overlooked the existence of Buster's own (very tidy) diary? Watch the Brownlow/Gill documentary ""A Hard Act to Follow"", or dig up a used copy of the Blesh biography, but for heaven's sake don't let this dreadfully misguided piece of manufactured pathos be your only impression of Buster!"
2,Book Review,We used this book for my American History Class since 1945. I like learning about history. The major thing that my classmates and I disliked about the book is how it would jump time periods. For example we would be in chapter and it would be discussing the time period 1945-1955 and then the next section would jump to 1970 and then the following section we would be back discussing 1945.
4,pretty good,"The book came in pretty good condition. I did not expect great condition because that was not in the product description. I got a ""good"" condition book for a good price."
5,I wish more music like this was available.,"I bought this CD and have listened to it many times, and each time it gets better. I had never heard of John Beal before until I was referred, by a friend. This CD is great!! My favorite piece is courage march, my other favorites include broken arrow, casualties of war and chaplin. I just wish more music like this was available, I can't get enough, I think Mr. Beal is the ""John Williams"" of the trailer music business. Bravo!, and continue the outstanding work."
1,"John, I am 15 and I have more creativity.....","I am 15, and from San Diego. I consider myself a fairly good critic. From John Beal, to Alan Silvetri, I have all of the soundtracks and such. I hope to become a composer later on in life, and I have already created scores for movies, and trailers. Come on John! I bought your CD in hope of an anthology of a great, but it fell short. Out of thirty something two minute trailers, maybe three are decent. It must have been hard to come up with them all, but even I can do better than this. Word of advice, DON'T BUY THIS CD UNLESS YOU ARE COLLECTING THEM WITHOUT LISTENING TO THEM! Sorry, but the truth hurts...."
2,Redundant and lacking,"Off-the-wall titles are confusing, and there's a dearth of teaching strategies. Too many samples are given (good samples), but the form and content of each is not analyzed, nor are the levels of language classification of the students' samples been given."
1,Are zero stars available?,"I write book reviews for my local library and was asked to do one for this book. Well, I told the library that they wasted their money when they purchased it and declined to write a review.I usually spend a lot of time on my reviews, sometimes analyzing characters,discussing the author's writing style and so on, but this time it is not worth my effort.This book was just plain ridiculous---bad enough that one of the wealthiest debutantes in New York would fall for her doorman but when you throw in an obsession with Nikola Tesla and the neon artwork of a tortured saint, it goes beyond ludicrous and enters the realm of preposterous.I would not even recommend taking this book out of the library. I would not have gone beyond page 50 had I not been asked to read it."
4,VERY GOOD READ,"I am not a typical person who always finds a kind of book that I really like.. ""Crazy for Cornelia"" just started off like a dream would start. It was like I just got into the story as I read the first words.. The story is about a doorman, Kevin Doyle falling in love with the rich girl Cornelia. They go through numerous adventures alone and the author Chris Gilson writes off letting readers closer to the characters. I can't believe this is Chris Gilson's first novel!"
1,Disliked it I'm afraid,"I am SHOCKED at how many loved this book! I hate to put negative comments on Amazon...but I don't think I could have slept tonight if I didn't comment on this one. I thoroughly disliked this book I'm afraid. I really struggled trying to even finish it. It had HORRIBLE language btw. Luckily my sister had edited for me before she loaned it to me. I really would not recommend this to anyone. Sorry:(...like I said I hate to be negative, but this book just was NOT for me."
3,I was disappointed with this one....,"i was recommended for this book from Amazon and I waited for awhile to get it at the library.I was disappointed with it. First the main character wasn't written in too great, she seemed more like a nut case, and her obession with this inventor was alittle over ""the edge"" for me.I wasn't all that crazy for it, myself!!EMW"
2,Silly and without substance,"I found this book filled with absurdity, the kind that borders on insulting. I had hoped that it would lean towards fanciful but found it fell short. It left me feeling I had wasted time and money."
1,Thumbs Down for Corny,"If you are a serious reader, or even if you're not, this is not the book for you. I read avidly and enjoy both intense as well as fluff books. Crazy for Cornelia was just plain stupid. The first few chapters drone on, supposedly setting the stage for this romance to begin. When Kevin finally meets Cornelia, all measures of contrived situations occur. The characters are very predictable and the plot basically goes nowhere. Don't waste your time."
3,One Cornelia to Another,"I did enjoy the storyline. Rarely encounter my name in a book title so like that too. I learned a lot about Tesla, the electrical genius. All in all not as bad as some current fiction I've picked up. Usually, I read history."
3,The Bible and Science.,I am not a scientist which is why I have only given it 3 stars but I found the book very helpful. It shows me how the Bible is scientifically acceptable in a way I have not seen before.
2,Disappointed with exclusion of most important track,"The ending theme of ""Baby, I'm A Big Star Now"" - by Counting Crows. Why wasn't it included? Did I miss something? The rest is not very inspiring without this Important song; which is the only song that I'll remember the movie by."
2,no multi lane sata cables included,Would love to try this card out since I just ordered it however it doesn't come with the necessary mini sas -> x4 sata multilane 3ware breakout cable. Something to be aware of if you order this. Amazon sells the cable for about 18$.It would be nice if there was some indication that this was an OEM barebone card in the description.I'll update the review once the card is up and running.
3,Learning German in Germany,"I bought this box set for my boyfriend who is serving at a German army base. He says it has been helpful and he sleeps with the cds playing in his ears. Luckily, most Germans speak English but they appreciate your effort to speak German."
3,Helpful tutorial.....but not the best.,"I found the Pimsleur Conversational German set to be helpful learning the pronunciation of the German language. The program carefully takes you through how to annunciate many words and/or phrases. However, I did not find this program helpful with the overall structure of the language, or how to understand and build sentences, etc.Also, I found it difficult to understand some of the words/phrases it went over without any visual assistance. The disks are audio only, and I found the lack of actually seeing what the program was trying to teach me very bothersome.I ended up purchasing the Rosetta Stone program 1 for German and it was much better. And also very much more expensive!!!"
3,Good jump start for language learning.,"The Pimsleur method is a good way to jump start your language acquisition and speaking skills, but it is hardly a way to become fluent or to master a second language. For German one of the best resources once you finish the Pimsleur course is[...] from Deutsche Welle. It is basically the Goethe Institute's free language course. If you finish it with a good score you should pass the German language certification exam."
1,Not American,"I was very much looking forward to this product only to discover how much it is orientated towards Americans... Sorry, but language is a universal medium and there are many more English speakers in the world seeking to learn German than only Americans.The courses are very American centric... It would be excellent if there were an international edition that didn't require one to learn how to answer whether they are American or not, for instance...In so far as learning German, I think I'll come away from these CDs with a much better impersonation of an American accent than anything else... the instructors accent is far too strong for an instructional audio series.-ag."
4,Guten Tag,"This product works fairly well for me. Being a person that learns more by listening rather than reading, this type of media fits me more than just picking up a book. This set works at a slow enough pace that anyone should be able to pick up on the phonetics of the german language."
4,A GOOD PRODUCT,"I have been trying out different language learning products and this one is pretty good. Although it is not perfect.Its short coming is the omission of printed dialogue to go with each lesson. Some of these language programs make themistake of assuming that an adult can learn a language just by listening to it - just as we did as children. However, weare not children and adults have been taught to learn by reading. Listening just reinforces what we have learned. The exclusion of the written dialogue just makes it more time consuming, because one needs to write down what is said.That said, this Pimsleur Program is probably the best on the market. But it could be improved!"
3,Funny and sarcasatic..........,"Well, the movie was funny as the Brady's live in 60's-80's haven in the 90's. I watch the Brady Bunch reruns on tv all the time, and I thought that it made fun of the Brady family, but it was still a comedy to watch."
2,all this was is a spoof,I love the brady bunch i see it all the time on tv land then i shall this movie i That it was post to be based on the tv show it was not all it was is just a movie that is making fun of the brady bunch its just another spoof movie like scary movie or airplane why did they call this movie the brady bunch if it was a spoof of it if you like the brady bunch then dont see this it is just a spoof and making fun of good pepole trust me its not worth it in les you are looking for a good spoof movie.
5,"hilarious, without knowing anything about the TV-series","I stumbled across the movie watching TV. As I have never heard about the TV-Series before, I was at first very reluctant to keep on watching, as everything about it seemed to be somewhat silly. After five minutes however, I was not able to get that big smile out of my face which was definitely caused by what I was seeing. And I actually felt that effect for more than two days. A really great movie, indeed."
3,Kinda funny. Jan is about the most unlucky middle child spawned from Hell that I've ever seen! 3.6 stars.,"It was a delight to watch her life go ""down the drain"", so to speak. Hahahaha! ( X^D )The comedy was there. Cindy has the worst lisp ever and Marchia is the horniest virgin ever!The boys, Pete, Greg and Bobby all had their own charm (not to mention what a stud Greg was!).The mother Carol and Mike the father played their roles convincingly (especially Carol the wife). She still has that mullet going on. But in a very cute, slightly sexy kinda way. <3Sunshine Day is one of the best (if not best) songs that has ever been performed by a television celebrity family!!Story: CDialogue: B-Characters: B+Length: COverall: C+3.6 stars."
3,Where are the scenes?,"For years, I have watched The Brady Bunch Movie on TV, and always found it funny. I decided to purchase it, because my taped version from TV was wearing out. I was SO dissipointed when I got this tape. There were lots of scenes missing, including a complete sub-plot about termites in the Dittmeyer's bathroom. Now, when you see Mr. Dittmeyer in the mall with the neck brace and toilet, it makes no sense!Is this the way all tapes of this movie are? Is this the way (film makers)originally distrubuted the movie? I don't know, but it makes me mad that the TV version is actually superior to the video tape version. What's up?"
4,Better than the original series,"I was and still never a big fan of the original t.v. series. I love this movie though. Gary Cole looks nothing like the original Father, but i think he is the funniest part of the show. Shelly long also did a good job playing Carol Brady. I was disapointed Tiger the dog didn't make a cameo appearance. I guess the movie couldn't be perfect."
5,great for work,fit great and are just what i need for work. they are perfect for warehouse workers or any physical labor titles.
3,Like it but..,"The work short is very good. I would rate it 5-stars, but I wouldn't as it is too loose fit for my waist size. It fits my waist exactly, but the short itself is too loose so my legs looks too small in it. I'll take to a tailor to fix it for me."
2,Tough as nails,"Looking for sturdy shorts, you found em.The fabric is so tough, it will barely bend. More like canvas than cloth.The length is good and long - past the knee.The reason these got sent back is old-man waist - they fasten above the bellybutton."
4,Durable Shorts,"I wore a pair of these regularly in the warm months for, uh, eight years? My girlfriend pointed out they were looking a bit worn, so I ordered a new pair to match. These may be the most durable piece of clothing I've ever owned. Not exactly the pinnacle of style, but I'm not a runway model, either."
1,Sloppy Processing,I've ordered these shorts 4 days ago and they still can't seem to get it shipped out of their warehouse. Don't bother with this buy them from your local store. Who knows when I will receive them.
4,Out of stock,When a size finishes it takes a long time before it comes back! other wise this is a great deal.
1,Highly disappointed,"Dickies Men's 13 Inch Inseam Work Short With Multi Use Pocket, Khaki, 36 is my worst buying experience through Amazon. The price is normal but the cloth is so though (like a plastic table cloth) that you feel as if you are touching a sand paper. And the style of it? My wife and my sohn started laughing as I first tried it on. How they produce and sell something like this? I returned the item right away."
5,Excelent pair of cell phone work shorts!,"I got a pair of these cell phone work shorts last summer and they are absolutely great for the summer. I especially like the length of the shorts, the 13 inch inseam goes just below my knees which is great because i just hate how some of my old shorts were just too short. Plus the cell phone pocket is extremely useful especially when i'm in the car and the phone goes off. My regular pocket just makes it too difficult to reach the phone but the cell phone pocket is perfect. If you are planning on getting a pair of these shorts get it from this seller. They have quick and reliable shipping for most of the colors. By the way i also got a pair of the Dickies 874 Work pant the same time and they are equally great. Dickies 874 Original Work Pants in Many Colors"
5,A great sourcebook Torg GMs should all own,"This sourcebook is a must-have for Torg GMs. It details the magic of Torg, as practiced in the Torg Infiniverse. It gives complete rules for the creation of magic spells, along with tons of spells for your characters to use."
3,It's nice movie,The movie has the normal tamil movie stories like the hero (Nakul as Sabha) is from a slum love the heroine ( Sunaina as Meera) is from a wealthy family. Emrges a love in between them. the story diverts when Sabha knows about the death of his lover Meera and he is not accepting the fact. Sabha flees with meera's body because he believes that she si still alive andhe could live with her.
5,"Im A Rocket Man, No No... that's wrong. Weeeeee!","""The Illustrated Man"" is the ultimate culmination of mystery, suspense, action, intrigue, and science fiction. The book grabbed me from the moment I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. It was gripping and inventive at the same time, the fact that the novel was a collection of short stories tied together by one character gives sort of a fourth person perspective. There is a morbid, almost mean spirited side to the stories, but that only adds to the philosophical and intellectual value of the book. All science fiction readers would love this novel."
3,an uneven collection of early science fiction short stories,"'The Illustrated Man' is a collection of futuristic stories by Ray Bradbury. Although the stories stand by themselves, most are set in the near future when Mars is colonized by humans. The stories typically have a humanistic/social angle rather than much in the way of action, although a couple fit decidedly in the horror genre. It is these futuristic horror stories that were most enjoyable.Bottom line: a hit and miss collection of early science fiction stories that, I suppose, might be best left to Ray Bradbury fans. Weak recommendation."
4,Clever and creative,"Very interesting book. Never gets dull, as it is really a series of very short stories almost all of them concerning the nature of God.Bradbury comes out strongly against both religious people who are inflexible in their definition of God AND atheists. As an agnostic, I was actually a little irritated with parts of it, but you know, it would be hypocritical of me to expect Christians to take it, but not accept a little bit of criticism myself. So, just read it with a very open mind and a lot of curiosity about the world, and you'll love it."
5,"The Illustrated Man, a wonderful book.","This book is so beautiful. Ray Bradbury presents himself as a nameless narrator who meets the Illustrated Man--a wanderer whose entire body is a living canvas of exotic tattoos. What's even more remarkable, and increasingly disturbing, is that the illustrations are themselves magically alive and each proceeds to unfold its own story, such as ""The Veldt,"" wherein rowdy children take a game of virtual reality way over the edge. Or ""Kaleidoscope,"" a heartbreaking portrait of stranded astronauts about to reenter our atmosphere--without the benefit of a spaceship."
4,The Illustrated Man,"To me this book was a really good book. I like how it had all kinds of different stories in it. It was really interesting because pne of the stories was about a tattoo artist and his tattoo were based one what the person life would be about. Ilike his style of writting to. He showed good tone and mood in all his stories.One of my favorite quotes in the book is in the story called The Rocket Man and the fater says ""Dont be a rocket man."" I know its short but it mean a lot because he said when your out here you want to be out there and when your out there you want to be out here.What i didn't like about the book was some of the stories were to confusing and to me and my opinion some were to boring. Like the last couple of stories were not all the intersting. I rally wasn't into them. Also my opinion is that it should not be mad for kids to readaround the nations."
5,The Ilustrated Man,"This tale of adventure and scientific genre is a wonderful imaginative book for children and adults. Thisbook takes place in many times the past,future,and the present. The it goes a man with tattos is in the middle of nowhere and meats a nother dweller where the tatto man or in other words the illustrated man show him nis tattos and how they move and tale storys of the future and space.I was completely satisfied of this book and how Ray Bradbury thought the future would be from his point of view of the 50's. This novel not only tells of one story but a varitey of 18 different storys that teach us 18 different lessons. This story ranges from different time periods ranging from 1975 to 2055 and on. I strongly recommend this book for scientific enthusiast."
4,The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury,"The Illustrated Man is about a man who is cursed with tatoos that tell the story of the future. In this book, the super technological future is in the 1990's. Most of the stories have to do with space travel and science fiction.The Illustrated Man is a terrific book. I am glad I read it this summer. There is a mix of action suspense and history in the book. I would give it a 9.5 out of 10. The only thing holding it back from a perfect 10 is that it wasn't consistent. There would be a very good, high-paced, action or suspense story followed by a story that was, sad to say, boring. None the less, the overall book was great and it showed a sense of imagination to let your mind travel.Though The Illustrated Man was a good book, it wouldn't be necessary to read in schools. It isn't a classic and I wouldn't put in the ranks of To Kill a Moking Bird by Harper Lee or I know Why th Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angeleu. Plus, the book focuses on too many different subjects."
3,"Classic Bradbury, but not his best","This collection of classic sci-fi stories from Ray Bradbury is a little dated, with rocket ships and Martians and a 1950s sensibility (and sex roles). There's no real unifying theme, despite the ""illustrated man"" who bears each tale as a tattoo on his body. Most of the stories are dark and more psychological than speculative fiction, Martians and spaceships notwithstanding. Don't expect any of the usual ""twist"" endings common to short stories from this time period, but if you're familiar with Bradbury's other work, you'll see his themes reflected here.I found the book moderately enjoyable, but it's not the best introduction to Bradbury, and it's not great sci-fi. Worth a read, but most of the stories just don't hold up well today; they were probably more thrilling and creepy sixty years ago."
4,pretty good,"this was my first ray bradbury novel i have ever read and after reading a few of his others...I saw this is the one that makes the most sense..the others were just plain confusing. Anyways, this book is about man with tattoos that come to life and tell stories about the future...its a pretty good book and you should check it out. Don't stop reading after the first story; it's a little demented (to me) but it's still great and i loved it."
3,The Illustrated Man,"I had to read The Illustrated Man for English class over the summer, and I think it's pretty good for science-fiction. The stories teach a lot of useful lessons that make you question how well you are living your life. There are stories about the end of the world and men going out into space.I think this book is good for required reading because of the lessons it teaches. They really are useful and simple to apply to your everyday life."
4,English II H,"I think the Illustrated Man is a good book to read over the summer. I thought the stories were quite interesting but a little too childish, but as I kept reading on i thought it had good morals and good hooks to keep you reading. It could also could widen your imagination. You could also make a picture of what might happen in the future by reading this book. Most of the stories are taking place in the future and informs you about these great machines.I think Ray Bradbury did a brilliant job on a unigue story format by taking a story and making the reader find out and keep reading. My favorite story was the ""The Rocket Man"" because i really enjoyed the story and I couldnt put it down. I definetly would recommend for you to read this book because you would enjoy like I did. First I thought this was an inappriopriate book to read for sophomore english but after I read the book I definelty think it is worth reading."
4,Very Creative.....The illustrated Man,"The Illustration Man was a very creative story. I really like the way the author brings thye stories to life from a man that is tattooed everywhere. It was very different from other novels, hiow the stories come off of a man that has illustrations on him.My favorite quote in the book was,"" Eighteen Illustrations, eighteen tales. I counted them one by one. Primarily my eyes focused upon a scene, a large house with two people in it. I saw a flight of vultures on a blazing flesh sky. I saw yellow lions, and I heard voices. The illustrations quivered and came to life....."" This is my favorite quote because it is in the prologue and captures you for the stories.I think this book should be read because it is very creative. One story leads on to the other in some ways. The prologue and the epilogue are very good scenes."
4,The Illustrated Man,"I thought that this book called the Illustrated Man was a pretty decent book to read through your summer. This book is a sci-fic book, with about 18 short stories in one novel.This book is about a man who has tattoos all over his body, which represents to a particular short story in the book. This novel basically is about a man thinking and imagining what is going to happen in the future.Well in this entire book i had many quotes that i liked a lot, but one that caught my eye on the most was the short story called The Exiles, and the quote was ""Death Real Death for all of us"". I really liked this quote because it showed that not only one but all of us have an end to life.I recommend this novel to those people who like mystery and exciting stories at the same time. I basically enjoyed reading this novel even though it was pretty much confusing at the beginning of the story, but as the story went on from one to another it all came to an actually and realistic conclusion at the end."
3,A series of chilling short stories,"The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradburry was interesting. not near the quality of farenheit 451, but still not bad. another series of short stories, this one was displayed as predictions of the future. They were pretty good, and if you want to read short stories, i prefered them over one more for the road. very easy to read and understand. Most of them were a little chilling. They definitely gave a view of Bradbury's love of horror. Ranging from space travel to an african safari in your home, this book covered just about every futuristic thought."
1,Most boring and confusing book ever!,Hard to follow is one way to describe a very dull and depressing book. The print in the paperback is smaller than the font on Lawyer contract paper. His stupid writing is much worse than mine (I'm 13). I aggree with the other 1 star people on this page and the others are nerds or stupid.
1,dosent deserve even 1 star,"This is possibly the worst book that has ever been written. There is no plot, and no aparent theme unless you count death, misery, space, and martians. I have heard kindergardeners come up with stories much better than this, in fact i dont know how this book was ever published. This is a book that inspires you to write a book becuase it shows that basically it can be as crappy as you want becuase obviosly publishers cant tell good literature from bad. This big is terrible! dont buy it!!!"
1,WORST BOOK EVER,I would NOT at all reccomend this book. Its very hard to follow-for people of all ages!! The main point is-DONT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!! ITS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY AND TIME!!!!
1,The Illustrated Man-,"It was horrible, completely horrible. It was so boaring and stupid. Anyone who reads this book must agree with me. I hated it. I hated it. I hated it. I hated it. I hated it. I hated it. I hated it. I hated it. I hated it. I hated it. I hated it. I hated it. I hated it. I hated it. I hated it. I hated it. I hated it. I hated it. I hated it. I hated it. I hated it.

5,My favourite novel ever.,"This novel changed me. It has everything, it has suspense, horror, action while also running on a deeper more philosophical level. Bradburys prose is cinematic, and generally I felt I wanted to read it slowly because I didn't want the novel to end. Suspend you disbelief and enjoy."
2,A collection of pointed storys.,"I have found over the years that Bradbury is a better novel writer than a short story writer. He seems to need several hundred pages to really work out a story, rather than a few dozen.If you have exhausted your list of all the Bradbury novels, then it is time to start reading his short story collections such as this one."
4,"wonderful short story collection, bound together by a metaphor","This is a very good selection of short stories that between themselves are unrelated. Bradbury came up with the theme of linking them through the Illustrated Man idea, which is very imaginative but doesn't quite tie them together closely enough. Still, there is real magic in the stories, perfect gems of sci-fi that stand on their own and can enthrall a child's mind and even an adult's. I remember reading with the greatest excitement 40 years ago and the stories stand today, though I have since moved on to more mature sci-fi writers, such as Octavia Butler and Frank Herbert.Warmly recommended."
4,english project,"The Illustrated Man is a great science fiction book. I like this book because it takes you away into stories that can relate to your own life. You can largely relate to this book even though it is sci-fi.Brad Bury deeply describes the imagery and details of this book to make the stories connect with you in a way other books might not. I also like this book because it has a futuristic touch to it and it kinda foreshowdows our own future.If you are into sci-fi books, i strongly recomend you reading this book."
4,The Illustrated Man,"The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury was a very interesting science fiction book. When by ninth grade english teacher told me that I had to read a science fiction book, I thought that it was going to be boring. This book was very interesting and also very easy to understand. Bradbury taught me from this book that life is never easy and there is going to be many struggles, but you just have to get through them. I really enjoyed this book.I think that this book should be required reading, because many students think that science fiction books are not interesting. But, many students never take the time to read a science fiction book. The Illustrated Man also teaches a lot of great points that could be used in life. Ray Bradbury taught me that there will be stuggles in life, but you just have to get through them. I think this book should be required reading and I that overall this book was really good."
3,The Illustrated Man,"Jenavie Ban Gahr High SchoolThe Illustrated Man isn't like any other book I've ever read before. It is full of fantasy stories, and some are even depressing. I didn't really enjoy it because it's not in range of my interest. Also, the format of the book is short story, and i'd rather stick to a novel with only one story.The thing I liked about this book is the different morals in each stories. I don't favor any quotes in the book, but i like one moral of a story, and that is to live life to the fullest. I would recommend this book to be read in school because not everyone reads a book like this, and it's a good experience for students to read different kinds of books. Maybe they'll end up liking it and it can motivate them to read more of these fantasy stories."
3,The Illustrated Man Review,"Ray Bradbury's book The Illustrated Man, was an intriguing and suspenseful book. Each short story was interesting in many ways. Although I didn't have a favorite quote, I did have 3 favorite short stories that I enjoyed reading. They were ""The Veldt,"" ""The Rocket Man,"" and ""The Man.""What I enjoyed reading the most was the Prologue, because it gave you an idea of who this Illustrated Man is and since Ray Bradubury's writing style is very descriptive and detailed I could picture what this man looked like. It also gives you an explanation why The Illustrated Man's is called the Illustrated Man."
2,Hardcore Bradbury Fans Only,"If you are not a die-hard Bradbury fan do not waste your time with this book. It is pretty much a campy (ie. rockets, space, mars, etc.) collection of space stories. There are a few stories here with interesting views and/or concepts, but for the most part it's a poorly written, redundant, and slow paced book.If you are going to read Bradbury for the first time or are new to his writing I would recommend ""Fahrenheit 451""."
3,review on The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury,"If you have dreams of going beyond in outer space, and if you are a big historian, this is the book for you. I gave this book three stars because it wasn't the best book I have ever read but it wasn't the worst. This book has eighteen small science fiction stories. This book was very confusing but fascinating. If you are not able to understand the stories in the beginning chances are you will eventually understand them in the end. This book is framed by the tale of a man who made fun of a witch from the future. The witch put eighteen illustrations on him, and if you stand next to the illustrated man your life is like a open book."
2,Quite repetitive and eventually predictable,"""The Illustrated Man"" consists of some of Ray Bradbury's many short-science-fiction-stories. While the first couple of stories may interest you, you will later find yourself bored by repeated subjects, settings, and characters.Ray Bradbury tends to write excessively about space, so if you are a space fanatic, this is the book for you. Otherwise, you will soon realize Bradbury's style, and constantly you will find yourself knowing what will happen on the next page.Bradbury's imagination and vivid descriptions are at times interesting, however. At times his writing style can get to be irritating. True potential, but not a thoughtfully put-together collection of Bradbury's works."
1,I know this is brief.,"I know this is brief, but I just wanted to send out a quick survey on what people thought there favorite story was. Personally, mine was The Veldt. It's one of the stories that is truly scary, not just in shock value, but in how it stays with you. Especially when you see how much more advanced all the different video game consoles are getting. If you have friends, neighbors,brothers, sister, sons, daughters, or all of the above who enjoy nothing more than to sit down for hours inside the world of the game; than you are sure to find a good scare in The Veldt.P.S. I only gave this one start to attract the attention of other people like me who enjoy reading all the one star reviews to their favorite books. :)"
1,ZzZzZ...,"I don't mean to offend Ray Bradbury, but I didn't understand half of this book. I mean, some of the stories are quite unique, but once I read on and on about the other stories, I got so confused and bored. I didn't like this book much."
5,A Great Book of Morals,"The Illustrated Man is filled with fascinating stories and morals that we all can learn from. Ray Bradbury has put much thought into his stories' themes such as love, hate, anger, regret, and most of all, hope. I was caught inside the author's descriptions as i read endlessly through the book. Even though the multiple stories are short, every character has personally bonded with me.There are many quotes in the book which would move every reader personally. In my opinion, one quote stood out among the others. ""Love will fly if held too lightly, love will die if held too tightly."" At first, the quote was hard to believe, but as I read on in the story, I believed more and more in what the author wished to tell the readers.As a person that has taken this book closely to heart, I highly suggest this book to be a required reading item in schools. The morals that are taught in this novel should be wide-spread across the globe and throughout time."
3,3 stars,I gave the book 3 stars because I didn't really like hte book. It really didn't grab my interest. I also got lost a couple of times. I didn't know how to coprehend some of the thing that the novel was saying. The reason i didn't give the book 1 or 2 stars because i did like two chapter of the book. The veldt and the other foot I thought that the veldt was cool because the house did everything for the children and i thought that was cool. I also thought that the other foot was cool too because I liked how the blacks let the whites live with them on mars.
5,Rip bradbury,this is a wonderful set of stories. r.i.p. bradbury we will miss such a peaceful talented soul. r.i.p. ray bradbury june 5 2012
3,The pros and cons of The Illustrated Man,"The Illustrated Man is a good book but it has its flaws. The Illustrated Man is a good book because of the creative and wonderous images described in the story. The plot is also interesting and mysterious. However, the book can sometimes be confusing because all characters in each of the 18 stories are not properly introduced but are described later on as the story progresses. The Illustrated Man also introduces many charactersthat are hard to remember.This book should be required reading for several reasons. First, the book is full of great imaginative descriptions. This book is also short so some students with short attention spans can easily complete the book within a few days. Finally, although this book introduces many characters, the 18 stories can easily be remembered by almost any student."
1,Boring and silly stories,"I admit that I am not a fan of science fiction. Bradbury has written some good stories but this book is not one of them. It is essentially 19 short stories put together by the idea that a man's tattoos come to life.But most of the stories are simply boring or silly. One or two might be worth reading but that is it. I say skip this book and read his other work, especially if you are a science fiction fan."
5,The Illustrated Man,Great to revisit Ray's works read when I was a teen in the 60's. An alternative perspective is what I need to be reminded of.
4,Enjoyable but somewhat redundant.,"While this fascinating collection of short stories certainly has its share of interesting situations, many of them, especially toward the middle, were not as creative as I had hoped. Perhaps this is because I read The Martian Chronicles only months earlier, but it seems as if Bradbury, though a terrific author, dwells on the same ideas in all of his collections. I still found some of the stories enjoyable and would recommend this book to others, but it is not as good as The Martian Chronicles or Something Wicked This Way Comes."
4,Awesome!,This book was really great! I loved the veldt! i highly reccomend it especially if you like space!
1,Worthless Purchase.,"This ""book"" -- and I use the term lightly because it is really little more than a photocopy with a slick cover stapled over it -- is not worth purchasing. It provides only the poems from Whitman's Drum-Taps which can be found in any collected edition of the poet's work; in other words, for the same price, you can have all of his poems, not just these. I purchased this book in the hopes it would be the original 1865 edition of these poems, but it's not -- just the revised versions (the poems changed dramatically over the years) rearranged in the original order. What a waste."
5,Their sound is classic country that never goes out of syle.,"Songwriter's Monthly From the name you might imagine a mean ol' blues band that plays some hot licks, but in reality this is a gentle-voiced country album that plunks along with a happy-go-lucky kind of grace. Even the track entitled ""Dunk, Disorderly and Dangerous"" has a peaceful, fun-loving quality to it. You can't fool us, Doc, your're one of the good guys, your music speaks louder than the words in your name."
3,"British Pop- ""Yeah, baby. Helps to find your MOJO""","Not a bad CD for the money, but one important thing to keep in mind.....SOME OF THESE TRACKS ARE NOT THE ORIGINAL ARTISTS""."
4,Grubbs takes on Crane,"Hovering somewhere in uncharted indie opera territory, Grubbs puts together a retelling of Hart Crane's the bridge. Be ready for characters, obscured narrative and looping repetitive riffs Grubbs has worked as Gastr slowly drifted to a stop. Let me repeat ""repetitive,"" cuz if you don't like going in a circle some, you will not like this album. Seeing some of Coxcomb performed solo makes me wish I had caught the complete ensemble performance. The B side is some minimalist work I don't listen to as much."
3,I'm just a comic book boy.,"There has been a minor trend in the punk rock world for bands to cover Ramones albums in their entirety. On this CD, the Beatnik Termites cover the Ramones' albumPleasant Dreams. They don't quite cover the entire album, because ""It's Not My Place (In the 9 to 5 World)"" is not performed. The Beatnik Termites actually do a very good job with these songs, doing straightforward punk versions of the songs, without the pop flourishes that somewhat marred the Ramones' original versions. However, the question is, why cover an album that wasn't that great to begin with? The album had some pretty weak songs on it, and those songs are still pretty weak. Beatnik Termites do as good a job as they can, but they are hindered by the source material."
3,where are the other two stories?,"There is only one of three in the kindle edition of the book and I know for a fact it's not 256 pages long if I read it during my lunch hour. The story is ok, nothing too farfetched but nothing you really would believe either. Jason waiting for her 10 years later with a dear John letter she left him in his pocket? Really since when does that happen! I hope that the author did get the Wicca stuff correct. She did seem confused most of the time."
4,Amazon's Burning Bright,"This is a great book and I have found that I looked for other books by the same author. I keep a log of what I've read by author and by name, so I can make sure I don't duplicate."
3,Beware--Nothing Really Rare in Here,"First off, my 3 stars do not indicate what I think of the material. I love the Monkees and have everything they recorded (well, except ""Pool It""). I just want to warn fellow Monkees-completists like me that there's nothing here you don't have already. All of the ""rare"" songs on disc two popped up years ago on Rhino's ""Missing Links, Vols. 1-3."" If you're new to the group, this is a good sampling of hits and rarities."
4,"A great compilation of hits and ""alternative"" Monkees","Hard-core Monkee fans will love the sound quality and the packaging. The overall sonics of the songs have never sounded better as far as I know. (I'm a hard-core fan who has heard all their c.d.'s except ""Music Box"") The linear notes are informative and do include updated musician lists. (Although, some of it may still be incorrect, i.e. I do think Peter played the bass on ""Goin' Down"" not guitar as listed).Also, for hard-core Monkee fans the Bonus disc of the ""Missing Links"" material will clearly state the case about The Monkees song-writing and general musical talent. Play the disc for non- ""Believers"" and hear them say ""I can't believe that's The Monkees"" I did not give this 5 stars because of the song selection. However, that's just my personal taste because I don't really like some of the Davy Jones stuff."
2,Not Recomended,"This book is listings of various common and some maybe not so common because I haven't heard many of these, conspiracy theories. The explanations are very short, basic, and thats short basic as in 1-3 page large print in a dime store paperback sized overviews of everything from JFK, 9-11, to conspiracy theories about The Smurfs cartoon. To state the obvious I can't recomend this to anybody that likes to do real conspiracy research but I also don't think I'd send somebody who has a vague interest or to wake somebody up to this book either."
2,A Major Rework Could Fix This...,"I have to agree with the previous two reviewers. The music and score for a musical have to tell the story as much as do the words, and it's not happening here. In fact, I'm not sure the lyrics are doing much better. Two stars are for the talent, of which there is some. Also, some of the songs are decent, removed from their content and intent. Honestly, I bought this sight unseen, without any idea of what I was getting, but looking at the cover, I expected something a little edgier and modern. Disappointment is the word here..."
1,The original film was already a musical!!,"The original film was already a musical!!!!!!!!8 musical selections: (count them yourself)3 choruses-children (opening theme)-children (""...hing, hang, hung...)-preacher & church ladies1 duet-Gish & Mitchum4 solos-preacher (""...leaning, leaning..."")-uncle birdie-pearl-lullaby (anon.)we don't notice because the music is so well integrated with the story, it doesn't stand out."
1,Works great for Acid Reflux,"I was introduced to this product while on vacation in Canada in 2006.I have tried a lot of other products that claim to suppress the effects of acid-reflux. This truly works, I now enjoy peaceful nights............try it, you will not be disappointed."
5,Every lie takes you a step closer to Hell...,"And if it means to meet this Satan, I'm all glad to do it. Once again Piers Anthony has done a great job on creating a thought provoking master piece! A whole new way of seeing life. This book is a must have for those who enjoy a good book. I could not put the book down. It is very fast paced as well as mind twisting. Read it! It's one of Piers' best work ever!"
5,Unexpected work of art!,WOW! Totally unexpected turn in the series. Masterfully Done. A MUST-HAVE. I truly recomend this series (Incarnations of Immortality) to all readers. Come to think of it... his other books aren't bad either. Might want to check them out...
3,Not Free SF Reader,"White magician turned, or, baby, Lilith would SO corrupt you too.Happily minding their own business, a magical family is attacked by violent chr1stian nuts. His father and wife killed, tortured and killed, respectively, he is easy prety for a demoness.However, he rebels against Lucifer and saves said woman from the head evil dude's final attack. As a consequence, there is an Incarnation opening and rather than have someone much worse take it up, he agrees to do it.Bit of a problem with this office, though, or, as The Animals ask: ""Oh Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood."""
1,"Horrible, One of the Worst Books I Have Ever Read","Okay... Piers Anthony cannot write. Actually, he might be able to, but by targeting the book and this series for young male juveniles, he is seriously wasting the lives of the trees that had to die for this publication.I thought the immature and completely tasteless sexual connotations were bad enough in the previous books, but this tops them all, combined! His version of Hell is totally unoriginal (copied Dante) and the plot is confusing, irritating, and boring. But I just got fed up with the sexual content in this book. If it was tasteful, I wouldn't really mind, but it's entirely juvenile and there's just way too much of it.Please, if you value your time, avoid this book and Piers Anthony like the plague."
5,WOW,I love this book. It's my favourite in the series which I have reread the most. A stand alone nevel as well as part of a series it is easily understood by those who haven't read the previous books. I lent it to a friend who has never read Anthony let alone others in the series but she understood it and enjoyed it. A wonderful book!
4,Really 4.5 stars,"This book was my second fav book in the series (""With a Tangled Skien"" being my first). I highly recomend if you have not read the other books in the series you at least read ""Being a Green Mother"" before this one. Anthony does a superb job of showing a unique version of satan and hell. I will not get into plot specifics, I dont wont to spoil it for those reading the series. I highly recomend this book to readers of the fantasy/sci-fi genre."
5,"A charming, family-friendly show","The latest in the delightful Thomas the Tank Engine DVD series, Thomas' Trusty Friends offers six new episodes and two sing-along songs featuring the lovable blue train. When a storm causes chaos on Thomas' island home, he must work together with his friends to restore things and get ready for the upcoming big game! A charming, family-friendly show ideal for young children who love trains and other industrial vehicles. 60 minutes, color."
5,Great,I bought this for my nephew and he love all the Thomas and Friends DVDs. I hope to get him all of the series.
5,Great for children 2 years old and older,Trusty friends from Thomas and Friends is one of the favorite of my granddaughter. She is only 2 but love to watch this story.
4,Panic at the prom,"My daughter who just turned thirteen played this for her Birthday Party. They had a very good time. This is the second Mystery Game she has played for a Birthday. They never did solve the mystery, but enjoyed themselves while trying. IF you never have played a mystery like this before...it always starts out slow until they get into the rhythm of play."
2,"Beautiful recording, but...","I was so excited to get this recording because I used to listen to the Hermione Gingold recording as a child. The only problem is that this recording does NOT feature Hermione Gingold. I will treasure this because it was a Christmas gift from my father, but hope the description, which is on the Amazon site and embedded on the CD, is corrected to reflect the narrator accurately."
2,Not as good as other curious buddies,"I LOVE Curious Buddies. We had all the other DVDs and my daughter is just in love with them from the time she was 3 months and even now likes them at 3 1/2 years old. So, when I saw this one, I thought it would be just as good for my son who is now 9 months. I do not like it as much. The music is not as great and it doesn't hold their attention like Curious Buddies at the Park or on the Farm or on the Beach. In fact, the music is sometimes annoying and I want to turn it off. I wouldn't have bought this if I had previewed it before I bought it. However, for anyone debating on which Curious Buddies DVDs to get, definitely get Curious Buddies at the Park or on the Farm. Those are my kids FAVORITES and I really like the songs on those DVDs. You can probably do without this one."
5,Great Entertainment,"My son is a huge fan of the Curious Buddies collection. Now at 13 months old he gets into them, but even as of 6 months he could be entertained for periods of time with the music. Great products! Would reccommend all, his favorites....Let's Go To The Farm & Let's Move."
4,"A ""must have"" for all friends to She-Ra","If you love She-Ra, want to go back to happy childhood memories or if you have children this is a ""must-have"". Starting with the meeting of Captain Sea Hawk and Adora, continuing with the ""Return of the Sea Hawk"" and then going on with 4 more stories this is almost 2 hours of sheer entertainment. The only thing that keeps me from rating this as 5star is the fact that it could really continue with the other Sea Hawk tales, just to keep up with the pattern. However it does feature ""The Reluctant Wizard"" which I had not previously watched ( and I have been a big fan of She-Ra and He-Man ever since I was 10!) Additional tales include ""The Stone in the Sword"" and ""Duel at Devlan"". If you are looking for a good sample of the world of She-Ra this video is definitely it."
2,music videos,"The camera work is very nicely done in most of the scenes in this video. Soaring over the cliffs in the Grand Cayon and some of the other parks looks very nice. However, the quality of the video transfer to the DVD is not very well done in quite a few of the scenes. Quality looks no better than a low grade VHS tape in the Grand canyon and some other segments, especially the White Sands segment. And there is abolutely no info whatsoever anywhere on the DVD. The only audio is new age music and maybe a little bit of noise from a waterfall. Absolutely no dialogue whatsoever. Not even any captions or titles to allow you to know what you're looking at. Decent DVD if all you want are relaxing videos and music, but avoid it if you want something informative."
4,Girard Haven understanding of the 4th Way is remarkable,Girard Haven clearly has a very deep understanding of the 4th Way teachings. He seems objective about his observations and also has an extremely positive attitude. I recommend this book because Girard Haven has apparently gone beyond just talking about Gurdjieff's ideas and has become them. He seems to have really separated his sense of Self from his 'machine'. If you want to know what the results are of one man's practical work on himself over many years then this book gives a very clear account of that. His understanding reminds me of Ouspensky himself.
5,Important New Fourth Way Book,"This book is an invaluable addition to the existing canon of Fourth Way literature. Whilst remaining true to the origins of the Gurdjieff-Ouspensky System and the basic principles of self-remembering and the non-expression of negative emotions, Mr.Haven talks about how to work with these ideas on a practical, everyday basis - and the Fourth Way is designed to take place in life, not monastic retreats. He talks about how to deal with ever-pressing daily issues and how to transform them into something higher, presumably, as the title would suggest, the creation of a soul. For many this book will represent a bridge between Ouspensky's brilliant, but somewhat intellectual presentation of the Fourth Way, and an understanding of how practical spiritual work on oneself can actually take place."
5,This is an absolutely wonderful book!,"This book is lacking in comprehensive text (although it does go into some detail with the individual paintings), but it does have the best and biggest possible reproductions of his frescos (with many close-ups of each individual panel). With hundreds of huge pages completely filled with Giotto's Padua paintings, this book is a must for any art lover and will inspire those unfamiliar with art to become art lovers. NOTE: the reproductions are Post-restoration and all the more beautiful because of this."
5,You've got to buy this cd!!! :) You won't be sorry.,"""Man Like Me"" is a cd that you can listen to in its entirety over and over! Every song is great! Bobby Pinson is what country music needs! His songwriting is brilliant!!Do yourself a favor and buy ""Man Like Me""! Find out for yourself how awesome this cd really is!!"
5,Awesome CD,"Looking for a REAL country artist? This is the guy!!! He has one awesome pure country voice, and a great attitude in his songs. All of the songs on the CD are excallent, I have to say he is the best song writer that I have ever heard. If you dont have this CD yet you gotta get it. Great CD."
4,Very impressive debut CD,"I bought this CD after hearing and loving ""Don't Ask Me How I Know."" This is a very strong debut CD by an artist who is a breath of fresh air in today's country music. Every song on here is a winner, no fillers or ""Stinkers"" on this CD. Mr. Pinson reminds me a lot of a talented artist from Texas-Charlie Robison. Buy this CD with confidence, and here's hoping Bobby Pinson will have much success-I definitely want to hear more from him in the future!"
4,Strong Raspy Country Newcomer!,"I am a traveling salesman who is constantly looking for something new and refreshing to listen to. I switched to country music about 10 years ago so that what I listened to my children could listen to. Good lyrics with no bad words or meanings. I bought this album as I liked the lyrics Don't Ask Me How I Know. My son heard the lyrics as we were leaving a hockey game of his on the radio. He is 8YO and he says to me that ... ""this song has good meanings to it huh'dad"" I looked at him and said ...""Yes it certainly does"" Pinson's has a similar sound to Bruce Springsteen but a more country version. I have had the CD for about two weeks and there are many good songs on it. Some artist carry the same tone and style in all there songs on their CDs, but there is a great variety to his debut CD. I highly recommend."
2,incidental music,"This Cd does have the original opening song ""Asterisk"" but that's it. the show does have great japanese pop for it's opening and closing creds but they are pretty much missing from this. This CD is all the insidental music that actually goes in the scenes of the anime.If you like that, then this is for you, if, like me, you're looking for the Japan pop, pass this by."
2,Misleading Product Information,"Please be aware that this is not as currently** described in the Product Description:""Pack of ten best-selling Bookworms ideal for building up class libraries. Each Pack contains one copy of each listed title. * The Adventures of Tom Sawyer * The Elephant Man * A Little Princess * Love or Money? * The Monkey's Paw * The Phantom of the Opera * The President's Murderer * Sherlock Holmes and the Duke's Son * White Death * The Wizard of Oz ""Those above two sentences led me to believe that I would receive exactly that -- 10 books, a copy of each title, to add to my class library. When a newspaper has a grammatically awkward headline, it can be funny. On the other hand, a grammatically messed-up product description results in a lot of hassle in having to return something that ended up being way over-priced for a single, skinny-little reader title.**As on the date of this review."
1,IT SUCKED!!!!,"Once again, an inexplicable parade of glowing reviews for an unfunny movie. You all remember The Last Shot when it was in the theaters, right? The $30 million opening weekend, the $200 million total gross? No? Good, because this movie, if it ever made it to theaters, lasted about two seconds. I can't imagine how anyone could think a movie with the star power of Matthew Broderick and Alec Baldwin, but which no one saw in a theater, could be any good. It's not. This movie was buried for a reason: it's boring. Broderick is his usual cloying self and Calista Flockhart appears as his whacky girlfriend who hates dogs, which is a running ""joke"" in the movie. The script strains for laughs which are not there."
5,Loved this movie,"I never saw this movie in the theatre, but happened across it on televison, saw it, and decided to purchase the DVD.No, it's not rocket science, but it is a very fun movie with some great acting and a mind-bending plot. Broderick and Baldwin are great. There's some very racy and very funny dialogue, and the best thing in the film is Joan Cusack.Based on a true story (somewhat), this is a very funny and well-put-together movie."
5,Enormously Enjoyable,This movie is great. It is very entertaining and hilarious. Matthew Broderick does a superb job acting in the role of a down and out wanna be screen writer. The movie does a great job satirizing Hollywood as well as government agencies and has some very clever and very funny moments. I highly recommend it.
2,A whole bunch of short tracks,"""~My main reason for purchasing this CD was so that I could hear the ""Men of the Yorktown March."" The end title, ""Midway March"" is also quite enjoyable. While I'm glad that Varese Sarabande did a complete re-recording of this score, I really don't care about hearing the 47 second clip ""Missing the Flatlands"" or the 37 seconds worth of ""Ensign Gay Afloat.""""~ ears very well at all..."
4,"""Williams at his finest hour""","Once again Varese Sarabande Records has given us something to treasure for now and years to come. The long awaited complete score of ""Midway"", wth additional music is a film score collectors dream. Williams proves he knows what the film needs and gives it his all, with brass building and drums setting the pace for this all out classic extravaganza.The entire album is thrilling, with two stand outs - MIDWAY MARCH and MEN OF THE YORKTOWN MARCH this is Williams at his finest hour. A standing ovation for the Royal Scottish National Orchestra conducted by Rick Wentworth, capturing the mood and moment of this truly awesome score.Total Time: 35:46 on 23 Tracks/ Varese Sarabande - VSD 5940 (1998)"
4,Great Usability Guide for Working Designers,"Must say that I thoroughly like this book. I find it full of helpful, practical tips to get your usability going. As well, enjoy the varied perspective that multiple authors bring to one publication! Nice illustrations and forms too."
4,Where are references citations in text?,"A good web usability book for practitioners. Academics wise, the book lacks of in-text references. In so far, I have not seen any references cited in the text and I don't think all ideas presented are of authors themselves. Correct me if I am wrong."
4,madonna's best single!,"i love this song,and if you really love go buy this cd now,but i would reccommend U buying the Like a Prayer albumn,its alot better. (madonna rulz!)"
3,burning crosses,"1 of the mixes here was featured in the Pepsi ""make a wish"" commercial. the intro was hauntingly powerful. some nights later i was at Mars(west side nyc), the dj mixed up the 12"" and played it continuously for more than half an hour. i danced till my knees dropped(mercy). the next day i had to run downtown to get my own copy."
5,Strange highs without strange lows,"When I think about Depeche Mode, this is the first song that comes to my mind. It's not a surprise, since Strangelove was the first song from them that I heard, many years ago.Because of this song I become a DM fan and today I own all of they albums and almost all the singles... But, this one will be always on the top. You can find many Strangelove versions and remixes, but believe me, the best ones are reunited here (except for the amazing, more darkly and slow-paced Album Version from ""Music For The Masses"").Definitely, this CD is a worth buy."
4,My Favorite Depeche Mode maxi Single,"I am not much on buying individual tracks, as I either go for the album or hold out for inevitable ""Greatest Hits"" collections. ""Strangelove"" is one of my exceptions to the rule. I own this primarily for the ""Pain"" remix, which I humbly believe is better than the original (and I usually loathe remixes). The only other DM single I wish I could get would be the original maxi-mix of ""Behind The Wheel/Route 66"" that early promo versions had combined as one great song."
4,Pretty Nice Wash Cloth,"These are very pretty, though I do prefer the yellow color much better. I would not, however, pay $9.95 for it, as it isn't worth that much. Amazon had a close out for $1.99 each and I bought 10 yellow and 5 green. I've only been using them a couple of months, so I can't comment, yet, on longevity with repeated washing/drying."
3,Disappointing,"I was wanting some green thick and soft towels. While these are pretty, they are not soft nor thick, and using fabric softener in the rinse cycle does not help...they are still pretty coarse. Disappointing. Kept them anyway for spares."
3,Bianca Butterfly,The wash cloth is nice and the written desciption accurate but the picture of the item had my 11 yr old thinking she giving a 3 towel set instead of just the wash cloth. I should have helped her review her purchase a litte more thouroughly.
1,that seller piss me off,"I don't really satisfied about the product.. He sent me completely another computer with a cd-rom not working, wireless not working ... I don't believe I will buy laptop on Amazon again....."
1,This thing sucks,"save your money and time, this thing was worthless. I had it for a month and it crashed. They also lied when they said it comes with a webcam, some do...mine didn't. I was irritated. Processor...also crap. says 3 gigs of RAM, mine came with less than 1 gig free. Do yourself a solid and invest in a Dell XPS of any model. Cleanest PC laptop you can buy."
4,damn cool!,"What would you get if you combine all the world of the Radiohead remixs,a bit of drum'n'bass and a story telling rythm?This magnificient piece of art, a wonderfull single indeed!!just GREAT!"
5,String hoop toy and my Quaker Parrot,"This ""ring of string"" is perfect for my quaker , he has been plucking his feathers lately and since he had this put in his cage, he leaves himself alone and constantly plays with it. At night he gets up very close and cozy, I think he is warmer near his ""string ring "". This is one of the best toys I've ever bought for my bird, lots of thumbs up !!"
1,Buyer Beware,I received this sprinkler and it does not oscilate at all. I called Nelson direct and they do not think it is really one of their products because all their sprinklers have a flow control or a timer and this one does not have either. They have asked me to send it directly to them and they will send me a replacement and run the investigation. Buyer beware!
2,Very disappointing,"I was looking forward to a verbal journey. A talk with musicians and poets, historians and purveyors of folklore. And I got a little of that. Very little.This is a very short volume, and more than I'd like is made up of excerpts of past books. This should be a little spice for the stew, not a major ingredient.In the whole, it reads as a dry (and there is the main problem, it is dry) history lesson.Again it is short. It would have worked as well as a long magazine article."
2,Interesting But . . .,"I found this to be an interesting tome about Danny Boy, and would have given it four stars but for one entry in the book. I generally read history books whether delivered as scholarly text, or a more relaxed tone, I expect the author to stick to the topic at hand. The one line that caused the loss of two stars was the author's seemingly wishing for the death of the President (p. 62) 'George Walker Bush, I hearby sentence you to be hanged by the neck until you are dead.' I really do not care how Malachy McCourt feels about the President, but it really has no place in a history of the song Danny Boy."
4,An Occasionally Fascinating Look At This Popular Irish Tune,"Malachy McCourt's latest tome deserves recognition as one of the finest books written by himself or his brother Frank. It is an intriguing, occasionally fascinating, popular history on the origins and subsequent popularity of the Irish ballad ""Danny Boy"". However, much of it could have easily been condensed into a terse article for one of the popular Irish-American journals or magazines such as the Irish Echo. Yet I must commend Malachy for adhering to a terse, journalistic prose which lacks the flamboyance and literary awkwardness shown in his bestselling ""A Monk Swimming"". Devout fans of Irish music may find this an essential book to buy, but I suspect most will regard this as enjoyable light reading suitable only for Saint Patrick's Day."
1,Save Your Money,This book was thrown together with little effort. It only has 100+ pages due to the double spacing and large type. Save your money for a better effort.
3,Average Read,This book was not one of Agatha Christie's best but still manages to get you absorbed into the world of Hercule Poirot. It was an OK read and managed to fill in a weekend for me.
3,Good Christie,"Hercule Poirot really shines in this book as does Miss Lemon. Typical with Christie, something small (mistakes writing a letter) leads to something far more unsettling and mysterious. This is solid addition to the Poirot pantheon."
5,What a great Book!,Wow! I loved this book. It's my favorite Christie yet! It's great because it's about college level kids. You should definitly take the time to read this!
3,Are you kidding me with this price??,"Come on now, guys. You are fleecing people by charging $19.95 for this item. It's worth about two dollars and can fit into a regular envelope for easy mailing. I definitely do not recommend paying for this."
1,Glad I bailed early.,I turned this off early because I know this formula all too well: the bad guys are depicted as so evil and vicious the viewer revels in seeing them violently killed in the end. But I don't want to feel good about anyone's violent and brutal death. What are we doing to ourselves as a society? I watch movies hoping they will make me feel good about myself and life in general- there is none of that here! I also strongly object to demonizing Native Americans like was done here.
1,THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY MIND,"When this Ron Howard western wasn't strictly formula, it was simply viscious. Beatings, stabbings, ritualistic murders and a constant peril to children give this film a smutty look highlighted by a bound and gagged group of young girls being dragged across the American southwestern desert. Plot contivances pile up as fast as the dead bodies. Just how much could these kidnapped girls be worth that they are guarded by enough gunmen to rob the Wells Fargo bank? The supernatural elements are an excuse for lack of any dramatic depth. This is a 'C-minus' western with a big glossy shine in which the American Indians are not only savage-like bad guys, but they possess evil powers as well. I guess in the mind of these filmmakers, that is an elevated status. Hey kimosabe, find me a John Wayne film quick!"
1,You'll be angry,"Of all the films I have seen in my life, and I include the beast with 1000 eyes, Wasp Woman and that sort, BY FAR Cold Creek Manor was the worst film I have ever sceen in my entire life. It was made worse because they had a budget and well known stars. Well The Missing is probably the second worse film I have ever scene for the same reason. Rent Pale Rider, so you won't get upset about your money wasted."
2,A LITTLE OFF,I HAVE READ THE REVIEWS OF OTHERS AND EVERYONE SEEMS TO AGREE THAT THE ACTING WAS GOOD. AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO SEEMS TO THINK THAT TOMMY LEE JONES WAS ONLY PUTTING ENOUGH ACTING ABILITY IN THIS FILM TO JUST GET IT OVER WITH? ANYONE ELSE THINK THIS IS TRUE?
1,The Missing Plot,"This film has some of the lamest set-up sequences.spoliersCate Blanchet's daughter, who's been kidnapped along with a number of other young girls by Indian sex-slavers manages to cut her way free, sneaks over to one of the sleeping Indians, manages to take his revolver, then hands it to antoher woman, who so distraught about the death of her baby that she's crying and crying and there's Cate's daughter handing her a gun! So, the woman shoots herself in the head just as the daughter's about to get on a horse. Everyone wakes up and stop her escape.Could she have done anymore to be recaptured?Later on Tommy Lee Jones and an Indian go to rescue her. She's gagged, and so while Tommy Lee Jones is causing a distraction the Indian sneaks to where all the girls are, takes of Cate's daughter's gag and she starts screaming like a banshee so all the bad dudes come running and gun the good guy down! Again, helping to prevent her escape."
2,lacking,"Even the presence of Cate Blanchett couldn't save this one. As a kind of frontier doctor estranged from her father and rearing two children, Blanchett does play a very strong woman with firm convictions-but the film struggled. I could not focus and it did not hold my interest. In the story, the eldest daughter (a very good, strong performance from Evan Rachel Wood) goes missing; Blanchett has to enlist the help of her father, Tommy Lee Jones, to find her again. The actors here all played their roles well, but there was just something lacking in the story and script."
5,A DARING NEW SPIN ON THE WESTERN GENRE!,"""The Missing"" is Ron Maxwell's take on one of America's greatest genres, the Western. What makes this one unique is the mystic elements infused into a fascinating tale an estranged father and daughter teaming up to find her daughter, who's been captured to be sold into Mexico by a team lead by an Brujo, or Indian witch. Tommy Lee Jones and Cate Blanchett lead a terrific cast, while the direction, cinematography and music come together beautifully. While it is a bit slow at times, the great elements make this a powerful film that fans of the genre will surely enjoy!Movie/DVD Grade: A-"
3,Blah ... Ron Howard must have had his mind on other things,"Ron Howard's films can range from classic to mediocre. This one falls more into the latter category. Blanchett and Jones are excellent, as expected, but the plot grows thinner as the film progresses. The early promise of a mysterious, mystical threat to common ranch folk turns out to be nothing more than a deranged, wanna-be warlock who runs a forced prostitution ring. Native American religion abounds, and in the end it is shown as being more powerful (or at least more interesting) than the characters' Christian beliefs."
3,okay movie kind of long,overall this movie IS good but alittle drawn out it seems. Set in the west in the Cowboys and Indians times a womans oldest child in kidnapped by indians. The womens long lost father who left her at a young age to live with an Indian women agrees to help track the kidnappers. Who later you learn are going to Mexico to sell the girls as slaves.The movie is well made with some exciting parts with good action. Worth renting or buying. Enjoy
2,It's missing,"Okay, when this movie was in the theater, I wasn't expecting much. Then I went to the video store and looked at the back on the packaging. It actually sounded interesting. Then I watched it. Then I discovered that I expected too much.The movie started off okay. I was actually interested by the characters and the cinematography was quite lovely and well, it was quite watchable. This movie doesn't sound too bad. Well, then I watched the movie through the end. That was one of the problems; it never seemed to end. It just kept going and going and all this extra going on just wasn't interesting. The movie just got boring and redundant. Bad guys hit a girl, girl tries to escape, girl in recaught and hit again and daughter and dad find obstacle, surpass it, find obstacle, surpass it. And, none of these obstacles are fun or exciting to watch.I'm going to stop now because I don't want to go on and on. That was the problem of The Missing."
2,watch the trailer--it's cheaper,i went into this flick expecting something powerful from such a good cast. i blame the plot and script mostly. fine actors had nothing to work with. anti-climatic and predictable. disappointing.
2,One Hour Too Long,"Decent idea gone awry. Silly dialogue, mediocre direction, horrible editing. In a better director's hands this might have been an interesting film. Not all is bad though. Two stars for the horses. Consider yourself warned; it's 2 1/2 hours you won't recover."
4,Good solid western,"This will never be compared to a great western, say like ""Unforgiven"" or ""Dances with Wolves"", however, it does prove that western movies will probably always be with us and if well done, they are fun to watch.This flick has plenty of action and adventure, I might complain that it got a bit slow in parts, and some of the relationships were too predictable, but all in all it was well worth watching and quite enjoyable.I am a bit tired of the same character type played by Tommy Lee Jones, he does it well but it's becoming repetitious. I really enjoyed the performance of the girl that played the younger sister I thought she pulled off some difficult acting for someone her age.There is a bit of blood and gore in this flick, and a fair amount of violence, which shouldn't be too surprising, but nothing too gratuitous.I'd probably watch this one again, although I'm hesitant on whether it's one to own or not. I guess if you're really into westerns get it, if not, rent it."
3,Coyotes,"Cate Blanchett proves once again in ""Missing"" that she can do extraordinary things in ordinary movies (Veronica Guerin, for example). Here she plays Maggie a frontier woman torn between her devotion to Christianity and her need to depend on the natural American Indian ways and instincts of her father Sam, who has returned to her life after abandoning her and her mother 30 years before, and who she now needs to help her find her daughter Lilly, who has been kidnapped by a renegade gang of Indians.Director Ron Howard's mise-en-scene is cluttered with all the cliché's of most Western movies: a chase, renegade Indians, sagebrush, and panoramic vistas. Yet, after all is said and done it doesn't add up to much; just the enduringly charismatic performance of Blanchett, who has proven once again that she can turn a sows ear into a silk purse."
2,'The Searchers' - lite,"Reading the premise you could be forgiven for thinking you were onto a winner here: Intriguing characters - sinister rogue Apache 'witch', tough independent frontier mother, estranged father who left to 'go native' - and a potentially engrossing story. But all ingredients sadly come to very little under Ron Howard's undercooked direction. Visually and dramatically the film compares very poorly in toughness, menace and visual power with 'The Searchers' on which it is clearly a riff, a decaffeinated, low-cal one at that.. Kate Blanchett gives a sturdy performance that deserved a better vehicle. Tommy Lee Jones by contrast looks ill-at-ease throughout. Of recent westerns, Kevin Costner's 'Open Range' takes up the reins of the tradition with far more satisfactory results."
1,Something is Missing Alright,"The Missing is based on a similar theme to John Wayne's The Searchers; a family member is kidnapped by renegades and must be recaptured. Unfortunately both movies also suffer from the same central problem, a boring storyline between the capture and re-capture. Both The Searchers and The Missing lose their way in a meandering, underexposed, and disjointed story that seems to have been created just to fill time getting to the final conclusion. The Missing is a tedious movie that lives up to the movie making reputation of Ron Maxwell (Gods & Generals) and not Academy Award winner Ron Howard. It is a step backward after a great movie like A Beautiful Mind."
2,Left the theater feeling empty,"Although I think Jones and Blanchett are easily two of the most talented actors in Hollywood, I was disappointed with this film. I think the screenplay was missing a substantial amount of substance. When I left the movie, I felt empty, like I'd just wasted two hours. The movie isn't BAD, per se, but it's just nothing incredibly outstanding or impressionable."
5,WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT??? THIS IS A TEN!,"MY SON AND I WERE BOTH SO TENSE DURING THIS MOVIE AS IT HELD US CAPTIVE FROM THE GET GO. HOW THESE FOLKS CAN SAY IT WAS NOT A GOOD MOVIE IS BEYOND ME.THE ACTING WAS MARVELOUS. THE LITTLE GIRL, DOT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE INTO HER CHARACTER.RON HOWARD NEVER MISSES THE MARK ON HIS FLIMS."
2,Doesn't Live Up to the Reviews!,"I'm a huge fan of Cate Blanchett and Tommy Lee Jones, but this film was a real ""yawner."" At more than 2 hours long, it went on for about 40 minutes longer than it needed to and the ending was entirely predictable. Overall, I thought Cate and Tommy did a good job, but Tommy's perpetual whining (even in Chiricahua) grated after a while, as did Cate's harsh western accent which brings to mind the performance of Robin Weigel (?) on Deadwood as Calamity Jane. There were also several plot holes in the story -- for example, Lily giving the gun away during an escape attempt (who didn't know what would happen?), when Dot was brought along to find her sister, etc. Too many instances where this viewer said, ""Oh, okay...they did that so we can have a problem with it later.""I expected more from such talents as TLJ, CB, and Ron Howard."
4,"Odd, but entertaining","This is one the more quirky westerns I've seen, but it's hard to knock. Very fine performances and stunning photography, it just doesn't quite hit the mark. That doesn't mean it isn't worth a viewing or two..."
3,Worth the rental...,"Rating System:1 star = abysmal; some movies deserve to be forgotten2 star = poor; a total waste of time3 star = good; worth the effort4 star = very good; what writing & acting should be5 star = fantastic; must own it and share it with othersSTORY: A woman has to ask her estranged father for help when her eldest daughter is kidnapped.MY FEEDBACK:1) Great acting...especially by the child actors in the movie2) Kind of reminded me of John Wayne's, The Searchers as far as plot is concerned.3) Not as scary and mystical as the trailers make it out to be4) Sparse, but well placed humor5) Good characterization, leaving just enough hinted at without giving you a full info dump on a character's backgroundOVERALL: Not a ""great"" movie but definitely one worth renting. True fans of Jones or Blanchett will enjoy seeing these actors working together and the performances they each give."
2,Cleansed version of The Searchers...,"At the end of the 19th century Maggie Gilkeson (Cate Blanchett), a rural doctor in the state of New Mexico, has to face the return of her unwanted father Samuel Jones (Tommy Lee Jones). Samuel who ran off with a Native American woman now has to face the music as he is rejected by his own daughter that he abandoned years ago. Maggie is forced to seek Samuel's help as one of her daughters is kidnapped by an evil medicine man to be sold in Mexico. Reunited the family struggles to find a way to get Maggie's daughter back. The Missing has beautiful cinematography and a strong performance by the cast. However, the story fails to connect with the audience as the disturbing elements of the story seem cleansed from indecent material. This leaves the audience with an awkward cinematic experience as the true rudimentary element of the story has been removed."
5,Familiar as living in the current southwest...,"Maybe it just taking living in the Southwest to understand why the whole thing seemed familiar as home to me. Curanderos/as advertise their services on telephone poles, raw eggs to remove fevers is still done. It would be like me trying to explain life on the Scottish Highlands. No film is perfect but everything blended together makes it a wonderful film."
3,Women of Years Ago,Potrayal of women in olden days was great. hardships that were faced etc. Scenry of the country was beautiful. Needed more suspense. would not go to see a second time.
2,Blanchett's better than the movie itself.,"Cate Blanchett's portrayal of a prairie healer in ""The Missing"" is, sadly, the only really good thing that comes out of this Ron Howard-directed Western. The rest of it ventures somewhere between ""implausible"" to ""downright unbelievable.""Visually, the film is interesting. But the story is hokey and contrived.The film makes the same mistake with Tommy Lee Jones as a lot of his recent films do. They cast him, expect him to play a ""type"" and then don't know what to do with him. Jones is pretty good, but only Blanchett is able to elevate herself above the material. Aaron Eckhart, Eric Schweig and promising young actress Evan Rachel Wood are similarly wasted.This is not an above-par Western. It's a hokey, ridiculously plotted B-movie Western whenever Blanchett isn't front-and-center.The ending of the film is formulaic and abrupt.Sadly, I wish I'd missed THE MISSING."
2,An Insult to Apache Indians and Intelligent Film Viewers,"Not only is this boring heap of junk an insult to Apache indians, but it insults the most credulous of film reviewers. It seems Ron Howard has a one dimensional view of the Apache indian because he portrayed them as theiving, murdering drunks instead of a group of people that was displaced and murdered by the white man. I lived on a New Mexico reservation with the Apache for one year and I learnt that they are very human and have goals and aspirations besides what is erroneously portrayed in the film. This is a standard fare from Hollywood which has a terrible ending and does nothing to even help the viewer understand the purpose of why this film was made. A complete career spiral for Howard, who didn't do anything good to begin with."
2,Grueling!,"Ron Howard, Tommy Lee Jones, and Kate Blanchett...you'd think this would be a winning combination. It's not. The acting is stilted and often silly. Scenes of gratuitous brutality are juxtaposed to Native American ""good old boy"" chit-chat. The movie drags on and on. An enormous waste of time."
5,The Missing I Can't Believe the Bad Reviews on this movie,"I am of native american origin and some of my family was massacred at Mountain Meadows Utah, in the same year 1857. I had never really been able to invision the way the people lived until this film. It was one, with both actors, who have my admiration completely. I will watch anything that stars either of them. Being a single mother, myself, I can not imagine how you would worry about feeding your children, and when it shows Cate wringing her hands from chopping fire wood, it brought tears to my eyes. It also refreshing to see a movie so realistic to the times with no cussing and the landscape was outstanding.I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to sit on the edge of your seat, and also see human relationships that go on, no matter how much time has passed."
3,good information about horse locomotive and mechanics,"The info really is good, just not very easy to read, so it does not keep my attention as long as a book that has a little more flow, easier to understand writing style etc."
1,"No more ""Murmuring"", please!","I've read two of Heather Graham's books so far, and this will be my last. Dreadful!I couldn't bear to read another ""she MURMURRED!!""The characters in this story were shallow and stupid. Absolutely nothing happens until midway through the book and that's just more dull stupidity.""Night of the Blackbird"" was better, but this author tends to create too many boring conversations and irrelevant details."
1,I hate not to finish a book but this was terrible,I barely made it through the prologue. Forced myself though the first chapter and could not go any further. It was terrible. I really enjoyed another book by the same author. This was really disappointing.
4,Decent,"So the story is not the best written or very deep, but it was an interesting, ""grocery store paperback"" type read. It is quite predictable and annoying at times, but it is still worth the read. It's my second book by Heather Graham, and I thought it was fairly decent."
1,Not worth it,"I have no idea how Heather Graham has become a ""New York Times Best-Selling Author,"" and this book is no exception.Her characters are totally shallow, stupid and unlikeable, and the dialogue is written like a 12-year-old, peppered with the word ""hell"" in every other sentence in order to make it seem more mature...but the overuse of the word, being thrown in at least twice on every page, during every single sentence the characters utter, make it nothing more than a ridiculous distraction. But at least in this book we didn't have characters ""flexing their fingers"" on every page as well.The plot is thin, the murderer transparent, and the book a total waste of time. Ms. Graham should thank her lucky stars that she's built enough of a name for herself to keep selling books...because she's certainly not selling them on their merits."

3,WCW Great American Bash 1996 review,"The tag team match between Fire & Ice against The Steiner Brothers was pretty good for a opener. The US title match between Konnan & El Gato was a boring mismatch. The Lord of the Ring match between DDP & Marcus Bagwell was so-so at best. The cruiserweight title match between Dean Malenko & Rey Mysterio Jr was a 4 star classic. The Big Bubba Rogers-John Tenta match was so-so in the bad region. The Falls Count Anywhere match between Chris Beniot & Kevin Sullivan was a fun & entertaining brawl. The Lord Steve Regal-Sting match was not great but pretty good. The Rick Flair/Arn Anderson vs Steve McMicheal/Kevin Greene tag team match was fun & entertaining but only story-wise. When came to the tag match wrestling-wise,it stinks. The World title match between The Giant & Sting was lackluster with no real surprises. I give this ppv a 6 out of 10."
2,one of his most overrated,hearing this song reminds me why it wasn't included in His Greatest Hits collection years back.it's a interesting mix of Song&Film clips combined in Samples but it's Predictable.not one of Prince's best moments.
2,Will it last much beyond the warranty?,"When our landlord started charging for gas but not for electricity, we bought three oil-filled DeLonghi heaters (TRN1015T). They were delightful for the first two weeks, then became increasingly noisy (one developed an annoying humming, vibrating sound, another an annoying clicking in the timer, and the third one had both sound effects). They all limped along past the 12 month warranty, but another 6 months of intermittent use later, two of them are dead. I'll stay away from DeLonghi from now on."
3,not what i hoped,"The F1T/w IHS is a good heater it heats the room vert nice.as dose all my DeLonghis, but the smell of burning electrical as noted by another review and the foot pedal thing is rediculous to use> I would except better from De Longhi. If that smell dose not clear up and I can't get used to that pedal, This babys going back. I'll choose another model of De Longhi FACJ sacramento"
1,Not what I expected!,The heater does not function well. The foot button is very diffifult to use and requires using my hands repeatable to get it to turn on or off. The timer is a sometimes thing...not very reliable. I am very tech savvy and didn't get much help from the manufacturer. I had selected this product based on a prior purchase from the manufacturer which was a good product.
1,Crackling noise,"I received this product in good shape. However, it makes loud noises when it is heating, almost like fire cracker. Had to return and get a replacement.Amazon provided excellent service. Quickly shipped a second one and took the first one back without charging me shipping."
4,Good value,"We bought this for our bedroom and for the baby's room. It does a great job for the price and is not too big (doesn't dominate the room). We chose this one specifically for the safety plug, so that we could use it in the bathroom if we wanted to.The timer works great and the 6 temp settings are easy to use. You get to know what number to set it to for the current outside temp. The only thing that would make it better would be a thermostat. But then the price would probably go up, and the current price is just right.Cons: can be a little noisy (we have 3 units and only one is loud) and the red button/pedal is really awkward to use. It is a good idea poorly implemented."
1,broken - doesnt work,"bought 5, 2 in the delivery were already cracked and broken.the other 3 failed within 6 mos.the thermometer is so thin and fragile with the tiniest amount of mercury in it that any flexing and it cracks, and you get some nice mercury spilling out."
5,Best Dog Stories Ever,"My wife gave me this book for my birthday and I was bowled over. The title story made me laugh, cry--and that was only the beginning. The comparison to Seabiscuit is apt. Panther is the definition of an underdog. What a great heart. The other stories, too, were wonderful. I loved John Madson's tale about the Lab Bess, who fetched mallards between giving birth to a whole litter of puppies. And the story of the boy who saved an old duck dog who had fallen through the ice, returning an earlier favor. Ted Lundrigan's story ""Trust in Black"" was so good it made me look up his other books on Amazon. What a brilliant writer. I don't think I've ever read a more poignant, heart-felt confession about a man's love for retrievers, or any other breeds or individual dogs.Buy this book for yourself or someone else. It will be one of the best presents you'll ever give or get!"
4,Fun read and good cookbook,"A fun read and good recipes too. I was a big fan of the show and the cookbook is fun. Having recipes from the cast and remembering episodes when they were cooking or taking a dish or eating at the Brick, fun to cook those same things at home. Enjoy, get it if you liked the show."
4,Get cooking!,"I have a couple of cookbooks published from TV shows or books, with characters adding their 'fine cuisine' to the book. Its a bit of a gimic, but still you can never have enough cookbooks, unless you have 50 and never use them. Enjoying it immensly!"
4,Fun ... and tasty,"If you loved the show, this is a must. Allegedly written by Ruth-Anne Miller, Cicely's sage and owner of the general store, the book contains wry observations on the folks and life in Cicely, memories of the show and the food served and discussed on it. Surprisingly, the recipes are good - very good ... at least the ones I'd tried. I'm especially fond of the eggplant parmegian recipe. Guess I'll have to take better care of the book now that it's collectible!!"
5,excellently researched...detail detail detail,"The author has spent many years searching for any reference no matter how small involving Sputnik. He links words like beatnik, vietnik, and refusenik to the influence of Sputnik. He even uncovers several songs and musicial groups that relate to the satellite. I loved the link to Machinegun Kelly's wife, very inventive. I felt that it was more a biography of the Nazi von Braun than of Eisenhower, the author wonderfully links von Braun to JFK. Just amazing how the littlest action connects."
4,As Advertised,"As A Lover of older style erotica, always liked ""EMMANUELLE SERIES""Amazed to find a collection on Amazon.Was thrilled to recieve it in prompt order,Sadly one of the discs was defective,Amazon made the return of the product very easy,There return process was amazing,Quick and no hassle, within 2 weeks ,had a new dvd collection at my door,Thanks amazon . Jim in Florida."
3,Emmanuelle,"I remember watching Emmanuelle and The nothing to do with Original -Emmanuelle In Bangkok(no pun intended) and fascinating to watch if just for the all sexy stuff except that two guys 1 girl part yuck! leave it to the french,to europeans to make such a movie and label it ""art"". Again as a Guy, Cool to watch the movie, but I see no art value and some would argue art is in the eye of the beholder. well behold this good skin-a-max film. highly recommended just for the scenes but watch it first."
4,emmanuelle,"An overview of the five videos made by Sylvia Cristol. The set includes three -1st,2nd,and last. The set arrived in like new condition."
2,Buyer Beware!,"The product description lists this movie as being put out by ""Starz / Anchor Bay"" in an uncut version. Amazon did not carry it themselves but referred me to one of their sellers. What was received appeared to be a Korean knockoff that had been heavily edited and cut. If you are looking for the original Emmanuelle films, look elsewhere - you will be extremely disappointed!"
4,school book,"regular textbook, general info. IF you want more specific info, you shouldn't buy this book."
4,What are your expectations?,"If you are looking for authentic Middle Eastern music, skip this cd. Despite the blurb, if you are looking for that ""extra, spiritual dimension"", skip this cd. However, if you are interested in fusion music - an ecletic mix of electronic, Western, world music with a Middle Eastern feel, this is an interesting cd. Use it for background, for exercising, for dance and you won't be disappointed."
3,OK w/ a Bullet,"It's growing on me.At first, I was pretty skeptical. I usually don't care too much for dance/techno-trip/ambient club groove, and less for electronic fusions with Jewish music. But to be honest, this makes good background music, for hanging out, for cooking, for trips, even for meditation. I don't think the music itself is spiritual or meditative or in any way the usual brand of 'authentic' Jewish/Israeli music. But it's kind of nice, it's chill, you can move to it or stay still to it, it just seems to work.If you're looking for the cream of Israeli music, this is not it. That would be a band called Bustan Abraham. But on the other hand, compared to most of the abysmal pop music that floods the Israeli market, this is quality stuff.And the more I listen, the more it seems to grow on me. I don't know that I'll ever be crazy to run out and get the next Zohar CD, but at least I feel pretty justified in buying this one. And if nothing else, at least it's not Ehud Banai...."
4,Good but flawed,"My first impression of this CD was that it's just another disappointing East-West blend with too much pop and too little of the Middle East in the mix. However, on second listen, the music started to draw me in. The music is rhythmically interesting and inventive, and the vocals give it a spooky diminsion. I give it only four stars because the music falls a little short in some way, and I find the drums annoyingly repetitious and unnecessary at times (especially on ""onethreeseven"")."
5,"Great Music, rare artistry!","This CD is awesome! The techno Middle Eastern woven in with Chazzanut and Arabic singing gives this album flavor and sustance, I wish they had another album!"
5,Women's Ministry Resource,"This is an excellent resource for Women's Ministries leaders. This book lends great insight into women leading the ministry, women involved in the ministry, and women that are targets of the ministry. Soul searching, positive reinforcment and a valuable reference source. I return to this book to review wisdon nuggets for my self and for the women I serve. Well written!"
4,Great Book for Endtimes Study,"Content proved to be an excellent source of infromation regarding Daniel's end times prophecies. As for the books condition, other than a few handwritten notes the book was new."
3,If you are already a dispensational type guy or gal you'll like it,"Clear, brief, and old school. That is how I would describe all of McClain's books. I am required to read them for seminary and while they don't put me to sleep or make me urp in my mouth, I probably wouldn't read this book if it weren't a requirement. There is a general lack of exegetical depth, however, McClain's views are more scriptural than some. He tends to spout off vague scripture references like machine gun fire rather than aiming carefully for accurate in depth exegesis. This is the kind of ""proof-texting"" that gives evangelicals a bad name. All the hard core dispensational types will love this book, I'm just not sure I agree 100% with his methods or his conclusions."
5,The BEST book in the world!!!!,"The Silent Storm is the Best book that I have ever read in my entire life! It's About a girl who is 13 years old and her parents died in a hurricane, on a ship. She has been mute ever since then (for 3 years) It is a sad book but very exciting- when you read it you will find it hard to put down."
5,For my Granddaughter....,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my Granddaughter, it was one of the books she requested. She was excited that I bought if for her, she enjoyed it."
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"The Silent Storm was one of the best books I've ever read. It's all about a girl 13 year old girl named Alyssa who hasn't spoken for 3 years after the death of her parents who were killed in a hurricane. Now with another one on the way, see has to face her past fears of that night her parents died..."
4,Great book!!!!,"This is a great book about a girl who desperately wants to talk but her mind and body won't let her. It all seemed to have started when she was four. Both her parents and her decided to go out on their boat. But there was a tornado, and her parents died.Fortunately for her, she didn't. Nobody really knows what exactly happened that day on the boat. Alyssa feels that when she can remember what happened that day on the boat she will be able to talk again.Incredible Book!!!!Read it!"
4,New Sound,"Well Miss R has changed a bit over the years...I had no idea this album was out when I came across it in the record store..In good faith I purchased and was not at all disapointed.It's pollished brand of country pop sits well with her voice which is unmistakeable...tracks like Destructive really give Leeann some ground to grit her teeth into what she's doing. The heartbreaking And It Fells Like is the best song to play when that's happening to you (belive me, I know!)It's well worth having this in your collection..."
4,"Lovely chain, interesting design","I bought this along with several rolo chains, mainly out of curiousity for the style of the links. This is a slightly heavier chain at 1/8"" so not the typical chain for a pendent, though it certainly would be nice with the right one. The links remind me of soda pop tops linked together. That's not to imply it's cheap looking, in fact it's very nice; just a bit different. It's a good style to wear alone, or with several chains of varying lengths together. Overall I liked it. The 4 stars are for personal taste only. I prefer the spiga and rolo chains a bit more."
5,It took six years to kill them,"I purchased a pair of 6"" normal toe grizzlies back in Jan of 1998. Since then, I have replaced the insoles about every 6 months. I used to spend 50-55 hours a week on concrete working with pallets, iron pipe, concretemix, anything else you could beat on in a warehouse. Since then I'm only pushing 40 hours but it's the same stuff. These boots have always been comfortable. Friday, I tore the left boot really bad in a workplace incident. I'm getting another pair tomorrow, no other boot will do. Period. Just talked to the same guy that sold me the boots six years ago. G&L Clothing knows their stuff!"
4,Not Threepenny Opera But Good,"Happy End was an intended sequel to The Threepenny Opera. It was not a success on the Berlin stage and has been only rarely performed since. This is supposedly the first recording of the original and complete version. Its hard to say precisely how good Happy End might be when performed. Reading the libretto, which was not written primarily by Brecht but by his collaborator and sometime girlfriend Elisabeth Hauptmann, I doubt that this would be as effective a theater piece as Threepenny Opera. Set in the metaphorical American city that recurs in Brecht's work, the story concerns the romance between a Salvation Army girl and a crook. This is not a unique story. Brecht himself, Bernard Shaw and even Damon Runyon used variants of this plot. There is the usual and sometimes mordant satire of capitalist society. The music is very good. Indeed, it contains some of what later came to Weill's best known songs. If you like Weill's music, you'll enjoy this recording."
1,Not as pictured,"Looking at the picture, it seems that the numbers would be visible at night. They are not and that was the whole point for my daughter to have a clock - so she wouldn't get up at 5 am - she can look at the clock and see that the first number is not a 7, so don't get up.... however, for her to view the numbers in the dark, she has to push down on the clock for the light to come on and it only stays on as long as she is pushing on it. The Dora is already detatching from the base, the screw comes up from the bottom and I would have to take the clock apart to try to screw it back in..... not a good value! JUNK!!"
2,Far from the complete guide on RSI,"This book is poorly written overall and is far from complete and there are quite a few errors. The only thing this book has going for it is that there isn't much out there on RSI. Yes it is true, a bullish trend is between 40-80 and a bearish trend is between 20-60, however the author does not really explain how to really tell when there is a shift from bullish to bearish and vice versa. I am far from sold on the whole divergence thing allthough it does work from time to time. There is a much simpler way to tell when price is consoladating and how to tell when it is breaking out of consolodation and which direction.Frankly, I think I am going to write my own book on RSI because it is desperately needed."
4,coffin clutch,"Well I was expecting this to be more like a coffin box, with more width and 3D definition as it seems a little flat and boring/skimmpy. I wanted to use this not only for my vampire costume but also for bringing it out every now and again but I think it's only going to be a one time use. With that being said, it goes nicely with the costume and is big enough to but some cards/ids, small makeup, and a small camera or phone. I wouldn't put anything too heavy in it as I don't trust the material to hold up too well. The jeweled cross is the best thing on this and the clutch looks better farther away (in my opinion) versus close up. There isn't much out there like this, so that's why I gave it four stars, it's not perfect but it will do!"
5,extra ordinary,"this book is the epitome of reality written in the style of a novel. As Steiner says, the novel approach is the only way to bring you into the full force of the story. Riveting--is a mild word to describe this book. We NEED this book to keep history in focus."
3,"Good, but flawed book","This book does a wonderful job of detailing what life may have been like for people inside Treblinka and in that respect belongs on everyone's shelf along with classic Holocaust books like Primo Livi's Survival in Auschwitz. However, Steiner's book does have one fatal flaw for serious students of history looking for ""facts."" Much of this book is in fact, fiction."
4,A very good read,"I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the ins and outs of a Nazi death camp. However,,if you are a true history buff I suggest that you read the afterward before you read the rest of the book. The author takes some liberties which are not proper in a true historical treatment. I did enjoy it found it to be a good primer on the subject."
1,Doesn't work!!,This can opener does NOT open cans! AND since that's why I purchased it -- I am very disappointed! I have to 'try' to open a can over 10 times...it won't pierce the can...and then I have to use my old HAND HELD MODEL! What's up with that?If I were a customer....reading these reviews and considering this...I would forget it and NOT order it! KEEP LOOKING FOR A DIFFERENT PRODUCT!!
1,bad christmas gift,I also have had a B&D can opener for many years and recently it played out. My son and Daughter In Law gave me this new one for Christmas. It took two men and a boy to install it and it does not work at all like the old one. I am very disappointed in B&D for this appliance. It must have been Chinese that engineered this product. Give me one like the old one!!!!!
4,B/D Black /Stainless Steel under counter can opener,Came in good shape/Quick delivery-Have not installed/used product yet. Have seen pros/cons on this product-will let you know...
4,slower,"I had my old under counter can opener for over 20 years. I finally needed a new one because the blade wasn't working.This one is nice in looks, it works well, but it is much slower than my original one was the day I threw it out.But it works and opens the cans, so I guess that is all that matters."
1,Don't buy!,"When we remodeled our kitchen, I wanted to replace our old white Black & Decker Spacemaker can opener. The old one was a workhorse that we had had for about 15 years with never a problem. But I wanted a black on and this one looked just our old one so figured it would work the same..but, nope! It's a piece of junk and is going into the garbage as soon as I can find a replacement. You have to push the can over to the left slightly as you press the lever to lower the cutter into the can. If you don't do it just right, the opener won't work. I often have to take it out and start again several times when trying to open a can. Buyer beware!"
1,Does Not Work,I had a black and decker can opener for years that worked great. I have to use a hand opener as this one just does not open cans. I'm very dissapointed.
2,you get what you pay for,this item was not even able to open 1 can without me turning it to help it out
2,B&D Can Opener,It was difficult to install because it dosen't work well on cabinets with over hangs.
2,Junk,"Bought this for my daughter because she wanted an under-counter can opener, as she doesn't have much counter space. Maybe lasted a year."
3,Spacemaker Can Opener,"This product pretty much met my expectations. I assumed from the description there would be more brushed metal on the unit (there is only a narrow band across the middle, otherwise all black plastic). Speed of operation is slower than anticipated or seen in other models. The unit came with good instructions and parts to support the undercounter installation."
5,Under Counter Can Opener,Received the hard to find Black colored under couner Black & Decker can opener promptly but it was damaged in shipping and missing the mounting hardware so Orangeonions replaced it within one week's time. Looks good. Works good. Barb W.
1,Utterly Disappointed,"I am so utterly disappointed that you sent me this item without the necessary screws and even the instruction manual. I ordered and paid for a new item and certainly I deserve to get what I paid for, not this unusable item which I cannot even install properly! And to be bothered to send it back is just so inconvenient even as it is so inconsiderate of the seller."
1,Black & Decker Can Opener,This is the second Black and Decker Can Opener I have had in two months and this one quit working on 1/17/08. The first can opener motor was not functional coming out of the box!! Very unhappy with this product
1,"Junk, Junk, Junk","This thing can't even perform its basic function of opening cans. Worked for about 2 months, but the plastic part that holds the cutter in place is - well, made of plastic; really cheap plastic - so one of the little tabs bent out of place, and voila! No more can opener. If you want to impress friends and neighbors with your useless-but-pretty under-counter can opener, then by all means buy this worthless junk. Just be sure to buy a manual can opener as a backup."
1,WORST CAN OPENER EVER!!!,This can opener took forever to install and now that it is installed doesn't work well AT ALL. if it actually decides it's going to hold a can it drops it as soon as its done opening it. I will be staying away from the Black and Decker brand from here on out!
4,Decorator Can Opener,"This color was a hard to find can opener, but my kitchen appliances are black and stainless, so I wanted the opener to match. It took a while to come to stock for delivery. The can opener is difficult to install, and did not match the installation holes of the previous B&D opener I was replacing. You need to allow plenty of room for the opening device to lift if you have a lip on your cabinets. The unit itself works fine. The blade assembly comes off very easily, as I found out when I removed a can. The cut is very jagged on the lid, not smooth as in most openers. The bottle opener and knife sharpener are nice additions on the unit. The overall look is very nice."
5,fantastic,i received the b&d canopener in a very timely manner and it works fantastic. it was also a hard to find color but i found it here
1,Impossible to mount,"Impossible to mount under a normal cabinet. May be possible in Chinawith their cabinets, but not in the USA."
1,Horrible Horrible Horrible!!!,"I should have purchased a manual can opener, It would have work better that this garbage.The sad thing is, I spent $ 19 for it, could have used this money to buy toilet paper.Ahhhhh, mine is going in the garbage, not worth it, to return it back to amazon."
1,It doesn't work!,"Previously we owned a Black and Decker space saver electric can opener. We used it for years until it died. The only thing I didn't like about it was trying to clean the opener part and blade. I ordered this as a replacement. It is horrible. It takes me longer to get the cans to open than it does to pull out a hand held opener and twist it manually around the can top. I wouldn't recommend to anyone. I would send it back, but I threw away the box before I tried it."
4,Convenient,Space saver and is easy to use........I love it......It is slower than my older one but I would purchase again
1,Horrible can opener,"This can opener worked for about a week, then it stopped working. I have been using a hand held opener ever since. I would not recommend anyone buying this can opener!"
1,Poor quality/functionality,"This under-cabinet B&Decker;(black/stainless)can opener is poor quality in comparison to the last one I had.We've purchased alot of B&D; products over many years and on most of them the quality has dropped over time and as usual the price goes up.My old B&D; can opener lasted 10 years and I only got this new one because I moved.The functionality of this new one is poor,it's super slow, I can open a can with a manual opener just as fast.Getting the can situated under blade is very awkward/difficult.I returned mine and got a Hamilton Beach/countertop opener, it's got better quality by far."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"They changed the hole pattern(more holes). They went to a knife edge (this makes a jagged edge) so it makes it harder to pierce some cans.You will find a lot of slop in the handle. You get spacers to lower the opener. I used the two wide spacers, you get a total of four. If you need more you will need to make your own (washers, wood or over size nuts).I think you would have to be smart as a fence post to give it 5 starsOf course there isn't a lot of options out there. People would ratherbuy 3 of junk then 1 good one. The market decides.It cost about $5 to make this item, and for less then $2 more they could double the quality. This item sales for $16-$18 in the dept. stores."
3,"Good narrative, but not very dynamic.","Peter Whittaker (son of Lou Whittaker) leads a climb of three to the top of Huayna Potosi, an impressive 20,000' peak just outside of LaPaz. While Whittaker's energy shows well in practicing for the climb, the film does not lay out the climb very well (and contains some factual inaccuracies), or show very dramatic footage of the climb. It does however succeed in showing the preparation that goes into the climb once in LaPaz, and some nice shots of the surrounding area, including Lake Titicaca. This tape would work best for someone heading to the Andes hoping to climb a high peak that does not require great technical skills. (Note: While the tape is named ""Parts 1&2"" it is really only 1 tape, totaling about 50 minutes)."
5,Essential material for the actor and director,"An Actor Prepares is a must-read for anyone wanting to pursue theatre. The Stanislavski System is the root for all things theatre and An Actor Prepares is the root of the system. As we follow a Stanislavski student though the class, we acquire the basis skills needed to ferment the acting talent."
3,Great for class!,"Just what the title says, great for class. I do not intend to read after this class is over! Just get for acting class, not for pleasure reading."
3,pretty good story,"For the most part I enjoyed the story. Even though I'm older than the target audience I didn't feel like it was too easy of a read. I liked that it was a coming -of -age story with the main character facing tough choices. What I didn't like was what Francie's trainer did and got away with and that Francie's dad acted like it was acceptable.A couple more things that really annoyed me was that the story would be going along then suddenly it was the next day and there was no page break or other indication that was going to happen. Also, they kept saying the trainer would never hire an undocumented worker and one of the grooms turned out to be illegal and had to be whisked away when INS showed up but later on the groom was still working and there was no explanation about how he'd been able to stay."
3,The perfect distance,"This was an overall good book, i read it in one day at a track meet. I personaly don't care for all the ""drama"" love triangle, etc.. I could tell the aurthor did have a knowledge of riding & horses. It was well written from the main character's point-of-view."
5,best ever,"This book is an amazing book! It goes through the life of high end riders doing the big eq. It shows different lives each riders have and what they have to give up to do their dream. THe book is very well developed and it is an amazing book, the best ive read. I would say its more of 14+ readers from somethings. They had a twist on the ending and what happened and its not a normal predictable story."
4,Equestrian story for young adults,"This was a fun story of a young girl immersed in the hunt for an Equitation Medal. Plausible, moves rapidly, satisfying ending."
2,"good for young adolescents, not so much for adults","When I read the reviews on this book I thought the target audience was adults, but it really is a ""teen"" book. Characters are not well-developed, the plot involves a lot of ""does he like me? moments and descriptions of teens and their problems that just do not ring true. The most interesting story line was the relationship of the wealthy riders and coaches with the Latino grooms. In better hands, it could be an involving story, but on the whole it was too superficial. It's not a bad book for young horse-crazy girls, but it's pretty unsophisticated even for a young reader."
4,Fabulous!,"I absolutely loved The Perfect Distance... I read it in one sitting! It covered the world of high-level junior competition surprisingly well. The only thing it didn't have going for it was that main charachter Francie didn't have a very strong relationship with her horse; but I also know that not many show circuit riders have a deep bond with their steeds.Apart from that one small thing, I found Ablon Whitney's work to be a masterpeice. This is a must-read for horsey teens!"
1,No new news,"I was disappointed in this book. All it has to offer are the 5 s's which don't take up a whole book to understand. Additionally, if you've taken a child birth class you were most likely taught the 5 s's. Not worth the money. Very wordy and low on information."
3,Get it from the library,"I check ALL baby books out before I buy & on this one I was glad I did. All I needed to do is read it once. The tips were simple, and I hoped effective.For my son, this stuff simply didn't work. He HATED being swaddled. He HATED being on his tummy. Luckily, he was not a really fussy baby, even though he had reflux. Dr. Sears Baby Book had more info on his actual condition, and covered most of the main points of this book too.In all, not a bad book, but I don't think it is worth owning."
2,Helpful but mostly hype - DO NOT BUY!,"There is a lot of hype over this movie. Don't get my wrong, the information is helpful, but definitely not worth $10. The Happiest Baby on the Block talks about the 1st three months of a baby's life as being kind of like the '4th trimester'. Don't expect to much out of them and try to create womb-like environments for them. Swaddle them, swing them, shush them, play white noise. Mostly stuff that you would do anyway with a baby. His techqniques for holding, swaddling, and rocking are worth seeing once, but you definitely don't have to buy the movie. Borrow from a friend or just ask someone about it. I received this Dvd as a gift and then re-gifted it because there is no reason to ever watch it more than once. There is definitely some nice information in this video but I never had some kind of sacred, ""my baby calms down instantly"" experience. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. It really just depends on your baby."
5,This WORKS!,My baby was super fussy at night time and we didn't know what to do. I got this book and now she sleeps 5+ hours at night and doesn't fuss at all! It is crazy magic and is now going to be my gift for every new parent!
3,good for newborns only,Prior to purchasing this book I heard raving reviews and how it was a must have. After many tiring nights I thought I'd give it a shot. The book focused on newborns and not babies beyond about 2 months of age. I can't say it doesn't work for most people it just didn't work for me. Some advice for somewhat older babies would have been helpful. Guess it's back to the drawing board. Good luck!
5,Made me a better and happier first time parent,"I would have been lost without this book. Even with years of practice with kids, little could have prepared me for the overwhelming experience of having a crying baby as MY sole responsibilty. This book is filled with the tricks of the trade that we as a culture don't learn from our community as a parent might have learned from moms, aunts, & grandmas a few generations ago. It is easy to do the 5 steps outlined in this book. More important is that THEY WORK!!!"
