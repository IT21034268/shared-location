1,Bike stolen,"So last night, someone broke into the area where over 50 bikes are held at our condo complex. Most of the bikes were left behind, because they had Kryptonite locks. Guess whose was one of the first stolen? They were able to cut right through this and steal my brand new bike. This is a piece of crap, it took them no time to steal my bike at all. I don't recommend it at all, all that's left behind is a cut lock and no bike. Get something better, I am not out a very expensive bike all because I cheapened out on a lock."
1,Don't buy Trimax,"Ordered two trimax resettable bicycle locks, one worked, one didn't. Contacted the company, they emailed a warranty claim, I filled it out and emailed it back, didn't hear anything from them. Emailed another copy, still nothing, as if they dropped off the face of the earth. If you want a bicycle lock that works, don't buy Trimax."
3,Cable lock,Does not coil up easily to be carried with the bike. Already lost the vinyl cover for lock...........Locking mechanism does work fine.
4,great product...right lenght for two bikes,"great product...long enough to attach two bikes-wheels-seats. Simple to use. works for my intended use & wouldstop a grab-and-run situation, but probably would not stop someone with a rugged/big cable cutter."
5,Fantastic length.,"Product has worked great for locking up two bikes, and making sure all wheels and frames are secure. Usually there is an ample amount of length to do so with this lock.Great buy for the price."
3,It's alright,"The music is not quite what i expected, i guess i expected something a lot slower and more relaxing (given the title). Something more like my Brahms lullabye CD or my Beethoven at Bedtime CD.This music is more on the romantic side. But since i like Rachmaninov i dont have a problem with it, i'll just listen to it during the day rather than before bed. One song is way too fast and i just skip over that one rather than listen to it. I would describe all the other songs as romantic or movie theme types."
4,Mi Casa Quilting,Took a class with Sue and bought the book as a reminder. Have not had the time to really delve into it yet but so far am not disappointed.
5,With over thirty patterns and instructions,"Sue Nickles' Machine Applique provides three selected techniques in a sampler which covers invisible applique, template and starch applique, and raw-edge fusible applique. Over thirty patterns and instructions make it easy to follow. A fine guide."
3,WHY is WSJournal quote first in product description?,What on earth is the trash quote from the Wall Street Journal doing at the beginning of the product description? Whoever did that has an agenda other than selling books.
3,An uninspired novel by an otherwise talented author.,"Brian Lumley's 'Demogorgon' is an o.k. read if you have some extra time and aren't particularly choosy about what you're reading. I may have liked it more if I hadn't already read his other books and expected a little better. It does have some parts to it that are entertaining, however, and is not a complete dud. But I recommend reading his other works, such as the Necroscope series, long before this one."
3,Lumley's Formula?,"""~The first book I read of Lumley's after I read the first few Necroscope novels.""~ hero I could sympathise with. But that is just it. It seems Lumley followed his successful formula here, but didn't really introduce anything new or interesting to the reader. the concept. I just wish he would have gone into more detail with some of the ideas he presented in this story. Who knows? Perhaps he will."
2,"Surprisingly bad, from such an excellent author","After the good work that I had come to expect of Lumley after reading some of his other works such as the Necroscope series, I was unpleasantly surprised at how bad ""demogorgon"" was. It is a boring story of a thief in search of Satans earthly emmisary. it starts off good, then mires itself down in the uninteresting details of this thiefs existence. Strongly reccomend against!"
4,Not too bad for what it is,"I picked this comic up at the Baltimore comic-con this past fall. I am a huge fan of the show and the characters. The comic was good, but as I am sure others have said, rushed. The art was unique and the writing was good, but having a whole day in one comic is too much. It would take a long time, but the best way to do a 24 comic is to have one storyline take 24 issues, one hour an issue. Still a good read, I reccomend it to any fan of the show."
2,Poorly designed,"Keep shopping. The steam starts and stops. The pole to hold the clothes is too short. The hose bends and cracks. If you call Rowenta they offer to sell you a pole extender or a new hose. Don't do it. Why give them more money for additions to correct their mistakes in design ? Also it is advertised to use tap water. After steaming take off the tank and you will see all this sort of white sand at the bottom which clogs up the unit. Wow...another way to break the machine and then they can charge you to repair it. This is a product that is designed to continue costing you for as long as you own it. If you buy it try to keep it going by using distilled water and disassemble it and lay the hose flat after use. When steaming you need something high to hang the garment on, the pole do it."
4,Great Product-Quick and Effective,"I cannot relate to some of the negative reviews on amazon b/c this products works great. It is only meant for light fabrics such as suits, silks and dress slacks. It can help on dress shirts, but a high end rowenta iron is needed as well. I have used the machine for over a year after purchasing one from linens n' things w/ a coupon and one from amazon for a friend, and I have no problems yet. It is really easy to use, and I figure I save about $50 a month on dry cleaning, so this item pays for itself. Also it helps avoid being subjected to dry cleaning chemicals, which have questioanable saftey issues according to some research."
2,Tank leaks,Rowenta IS-8100 Commercial Garment SteamerPurchased 2 years ago. Worked fine until the water tank began leaking. The water tank design is poor. The tank cap seal breaks down as thin plastic threads strip from repeated use. There is no catch basin and water leaks out of the tank and runs down onto the floor - right over the electrical cord entry point! No replacement is available from Rowenta and they do not seem to have a repair station or address. Another contribution to our throw away society...
1,completely disappointed,"I purchased this unit a year or so ago from Bed Bath & Beyond. My wife used it at home only a handful of times over a year or so. For the cost I had expected it to last a decade or more. It is labeled as 'commercial'. Rather than going into great lengths about the various problems, I'll just state that we experienced some of the same problems others have already posted. Caveat emptor!!"
3,Pedals don't work,"I loved my Rowenta I-8100 until the pedals started not working. First it was the cord retractor, then the standby and now the on and off AGAIN. This happened a year ago also and I had the pedals replaced now it's happen again. I am so disappointed in this brand and their customer service. Maybe it's my fault for expecting Rowenta to be a better product. I will try the Jiffy as I've given up on Rowenta."
5,best steamer on the market,"I've owned my 8100 for a couple of years now and use it regularly for both drapes and clothing. I've lent it out to friends also, so it's had some heavy-duty usage. There has never been a glitch! It still fires right up and within 90 seconds, I have all the steam I can use. The water tank holds plenty of water, doesn't leak and the steamer head and attachments all work just fine. I would recommend spending the few extra $$ for the Rowenta."
2,Good While It Lasted,"Though it didn't give the ""starched"" effect for shirts and pants, the steamer was great for sweaters, quick touch ups, refreshing dry cleanable pants, etc. --- that is, until the switch broke. I think I had it for about 8 months before it no longer would turn on. Can't find a local company to repair it. Based on other reviews, durability seems to be a problem so I won't get another Rowenta. I live in a small high rise so liked not having to get the ironing board out so I will try another brand."
1,"Excellent Item, Terrible Service","I bought this steamer a couple of years ago and it suddenly stopped working. Unfortunately, the only repair service is on the East Coast or the West Coast. This means I have to pay to ship the item to the repair shop, pay to have it repaired and then pay for return shipping. After a week of trying to contact Rowenta customer servoice, I finally spoke with Joe, who informed me that Rowenta is aware that it is less expensive for its customers to replace their product rather than repair it. I will do just that, only I will not buy another Rowenta product. As good as their products are, they are too expensive to be replaced every couple of years. Ditto for the Rowenta iron that I have. I love both products, but don't care so much for the hoop-jumping Rowenta calls ""customer service."""
2,Stick with the Professional ones,"I bought a Rowenta IS-8100 after my die-hard Jiffy steamer finally bit the dust. At the time I did not want to spend out for a brand new one ($150-$275), and the used ones in my area were as much as a new Rowenta so I opted for the cheaper brand new one. Big mistake. I did not use it that much, maybe once a month, but when I did the head would often spout out water everywhere. The pole and handle holder were flimsey and would never stay still, always unscrewing the pole. When you lowered the steam head the spray stream would spatter and stop (my big pet peave about most steamers)A time or two the tank holding the water would leak as well. But after only having it 2 or 3 years with minimal use it just stopped working one day. It wouldn't turn on-nothing! I would never buy one again. My old Jiffy lasted 20+ years!"
2,Great Looks; Poor Craftsmanship,"I'll make it simple: If you are looking for a home-edition garment steamer, your top 2 choices in the marketplace will likely be the Jiffy 2000 and the Rowenta 8100.I tested both for 10 hours; on a 1 to 10 scale:Jiffy (Looks = 6; Engineering = 10; handling = 9; craftsmanship = 10).It looks like a mop bucket on wheels but it performs like a jet engine; every part of this machine from the plate at the bottom of the unit to the steam handle is built for rugged usage.Rowenta (Looks = 10; Engineering = 5; Handling = 7; crafsmanship = 4).It looks like a UFO but performs like a Pinto with much less steaming power; it is built as a toddler's toy having most parts made with inexpensive plastic including the watertank base and valve: pull the machine a single foot OR tilt it a mere 1 inch and you will experience a slow-building cascade.Buy the Rowenta 8100 as a decorative piece to make your closet look good.Buy the Jiffy 2000 as a garment steamer to make your clothes look good."
3,"Farily good product, but not durable","I received an IS 8100 steamer as a gift. Now, nine months later, the steam head has come apart. It just fell apart. It appears that daily use (four or five days a week) may have been too much for this ""commercial"" product. I'm trying to obtain a replacement part from Rowenta now. I'll update my review once I get a final answer from their customer service department.When the product is working, it works pretty well. I use it on wool suits, and it removes wrinkles quickly. However, without the steam head, this is useless for me."
2,Water tank faulty,"I enjoyed how this product worked at first. The steam was powerful. The machine looked great. However, the water tank design is cheap. The lid did not stay on the tank well ever. I had enough when the lid slipped off spilling a gallon of water on my hardwood floors. I will look at Jiffy steamers which might be worth the extra $ for real professional quality."
5,Great Steamer,"I love my steamer! This is probably the best purchase I ever made. It steams out wrinkles in a flash in every fabric I own. No more spending time ironing for me. In a short minute, my clothing looks beautiful. I have had no problems with the tank whatsover, and love the idea that I do not have to worry if I forget to leave the steamer on. I used to have a hand-held steamer, and you cannot even compare the two machines. Bravo for the Rowenta steamer. It receives complete raves from me!"
2,Water Tank,"We purchase two of these steamers. We thought it was a fluke with the first one with the tank/cap. Both had the same problem. Once the water in the tank is replaced, the cap does not screw back on. Either the tank shrinked or the cap expanded. Fortunately the store we purchased them from refunded our money and told us that others were returned for the same reason."
1,Great...until it breaks (third time I used it),"The hot steam burned right through the hose that attaches the hand-held piece to the tank (at the bottom of the ""neck"")The hose is rubber, and under pressure from the steam, it literally disintegrated. This happened the THIRD time I used it."
4,Met my expectations,"I have used the steamer a few times and it has met my expectations. It heats up in about 60 seconds and steams effectively. The only downside is that when you are done steaming, some water tends to be left in the hose and the base unit (aside from the water reservoir). The unit isn't that heavy so I usually pick it up and hold it over a sink to let the excess drain. I imagine that leaving the excess in the machine might result in mold or other negative implications. This is a minor annoyance and wouldn't stop me from buying another unit. I would imagine this would be an issue with most units."
1,BAD PRODUCT AND EVEN WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I bought this commercial Garment Steamer some time ago and it is not in warranty anymore, the hose is dripping water and when I use it I get burned. I called Rowenta, and a very nasty lady started attacking me, after I said that the hose is dripping water, instead of traying to help me solve the problem, and finally she said that the hose is discontinued. I think that there is only one thing to say VERY BAD PRODUCT, VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE AT ROWENTA"
3,"The good the bad, the ugly...","We are very happy with the actual performance having purchased this used. However most will find that the 2 rubber washers that control the flow of water will crap out on you. In the last 3 years of ownership I've already had to purchase the 4 inch cap to the tank that has the appx 3 inch washer and a 1"" plunge like stopper. And within a year the new stopper has already disintegrated. I'm curious to see if we store the cap dry if it would last much longer. Interestingly I've had no problems with the hose itself and find it pretty sturdy. It does get extremely hot and must be handled with caution. Also the device can be used without the tank but you can't steam as long without filling the reservoir repeatedly. Not a problem if only steaming one or two items. As for the foot pedal, I could see if you have a lead foot that the pedal may not last as long. I would only recommend tapping it only very lightly."
2,Not worth the money,"I've had the Rowenta IS-8100 for about 3 years and only used it about 4x a year. Sure, it worked fine but as of yesterday, it just conked out on me. After plugging it in as usual, it steamed for about 5 min. and then nothing. Naturally, I went over the troubleshooting tips, descaled the water, and finally wrote to the company for advice. They said I probably needed a new hose. Not so. I detached the hose and there isn't even any steam coming out of the unit. What a piece of crap.When it DID perform, it did just an okay job. It was great for silk shirts but that's about it. The design is also cumbersome and the hose gets twisted very easily thus causing less steam to escape. I think the only advantage to owning one was its use as a humidifier for my living room. Not to mention the quick facials.I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Pleased with purchase,This was purchased as a gift and shipped quickly. The product is exactly what the mother wanted and she is pleased with the performance.
5,"it's great, just read the directions!","I love this steamer. It's fast, efficient. Most of the criticisms I've read here are from people who don't read the directions. I haven't had a single problem. I don't get water spotting or burned by the handle. Hold it properly, start at the bottom and work your way UP. The tank is plenty large so lasts a good long while. The hangar at the top makes it easy. I love it, wish I had it YEARS ago. NO PROBLEMS!"
5,Good Service,This replaces my older model. Some things I like better...the wand is a better shape. The water refill is much smaller than the older model. Seems like a decent replacement.
2,Not worth the money,I should have read the reviews before plunking out $160 at Bed Bath & Beyond for this. I have used it a couple times and have had no luck removed wrinkles from my clothing (significant enough to tell). I agree with the reader who said to stick with your iron (sadly enough for me).
1,Rowenta I am disappointed in you!,"Well, within the first three times using this product, the brush head attachment warped and fell off. Then the other brush head attachments bristles melted. The steam was powerful for awhile, then would stop unexpectedly,then start up again. By the fifth time using it, I had to clean away tons of residue sludge in order to get it to work. By cleaning it regularly,and using distilled water,I was able to keep it going for a bit... Six months later the on off switch has stopped working at a critical time for me when i need it the most for my business. I took it apart and it seems the pedal switch controls have completely melted. Why would Rowenta not test these parts for heat related mishaps?If I could give no stars I would. I used to be a Rowenta fan, but I will not buy their products again."
2,Rowenta steamer,"I was really excited, but steaming was not as great as I expected. Except on silk or polyester, it was not the same amount of work as ironing, so what's the point? I have no idea how it stacks agains other steamers--I only tried Rowenta, but it does not make a dent in boys' shorts with pockets. Great idea, not worth the money or effort. Keep your iron!"
2,Mediocre at best,"I thought this item would be terrific as a quick way to get the wrinkles out of my husbands work shirts. About the only thing it steamed up was my ceiling. It's difficult to control and doesn't have a good mechanism to hold the shirt firmly to get those wrinkles out. If you're looking for a ""finished"" pressed look you won't find it with this device. It's a short cut that produces mediocre results at best."
2,not good for the long haul,"Own this exact machine and now I need to replace it. The steam actually melted through the rubber hose making it useless.We had this unit for a couple years but did not use it heavily as my husband's job switched to business casual. When it worked, it was quite good, but it did not hold up and I really do not know how this could possibly earn a commercial rating. Will be buying a different product. Avoid this one it is a waste of good money."
5,Can't live without it!,"I bought this steamer recently to replace a similar Rowenta I got over 5 years ago. The element that creates the steam stopped working, but for as much as I use it I got a lot out of it in 5 years. I came to rely on it so much that I had to replace it. I use it almost daily and on lots of things such as shorts, skirts, jeans,and ties. Shirts & sweaters with creases from being folded can be put on a hanger and presto, wrinkles gone! I hate ironing and with today's synthetic fabrics it is not safe to do so on many garments. Plus, the steamer can also be used on curtains and drapes.Tips:Make sure you rinse the tank out well before refilling. There will be some sediment in it from the water. It is best to use distilled water to minimize that.Do not use this too close to a wall. You will find that steam can condense on the wall which might not be good for your paint or wallpaper. I store mine near a wall, but always pull it out into the room when in use."
1,Poor hose quality..,I bought this steamer two years ago. For $130 I thought it would be good quality.. the hose has been nothing but a headache.. after steaming for 5 minutes it gets soft from the heat and bends so that the steam doesn't pass through.The hose melted down and ripped off twice.. I fixed it with electrical tape but that doesnt hold well either.Poor material chosen for the hose. Wish I could get my money back.
2,"""Commercial"" steamer...not really.","Always wanted one and finally got it on sale at Kohl's. Put it together in 5 minutes, it looked great. Heated up right away. I started off with easy stuff...t-shirts. Took twice as long to get mediocre results. Mens shirts were a joke. Took 20 minutes and it still looked wrinkled. Unfortunately you'd be much better off sticking with your regular iron.I won't be keeping this long enough to find out if I'll have problems with the water cannister like most of the other reviewers...I'm returning it tomorrow."
2,Cheap hose - tore after 3 months,"The steam is adequate for what it is but the hose is so thin that it bends too easily cutting off the steam. It has a spring to help it keep from bending over on itself, but is too short to do what it was intended for. The hose tore at the top of the spring after about 3 months of light duty. I would look at the Jiffy brand the next time around and look at the hose more carefully, thickness, support measures, etc...."
2,does not replace an iron,"Bought this product after using a steamer from another brand. Was expecting better results from this more expensive model. The bottom-line is that these steamers are good for 'freshening' clothes before wearing them and removing minor wrinkles. Even the manual for this products mentions this fact. But even for this purpose, it takes more time to iron clothes than a regular iron. It is good for items that are inconvenient to be laid flat on an ironing board, e.g. drapes, upholstery etc. But how many times do you need to iron them?For regular clothes, it comes no where near replacing a regular iron. There is no short-cut to ironing clothes the old fashioned way. Please do keep this in mind while purchasing steamers like this one."
4,great steamer,"Istead of dragging out the iron and the board. I just plug in the steamer, hand my article of clothing and start steaming. I LOVE it."
1,Faulty removable water tank,I was just doing an online search because I thought my son had lost a valve for the one gallon removable water tank and I was looking to buy another water tank. I owe him an apology. Obviously I'm not the only one with this problem! The steam is powerful and I would be ecstatic about the steamer if the water tank held water.
4,STEAMIN WITH MY NEW ROWENTA STEAMER.,"I was interoduced to the Rowenta Steamer by my son, who is constantly on the go and needs those wrinkles wiped away. After brief instructions, I was on my own, the handle was well insulated and very little heat was felt. The on and off switch is easy to operate and excessible. The water container is large enough to handle any reasonable job. Needless to say, I am well pleased with my steamer."
1,Stonewall Jackson CD,I thought I was getting his original recordings. This was recorded by Stonewall but it was rerecorded in his later years. I am totally disappointed. I will not be ordering any more music from Amazon.com.
2,poor quality,"Price is decent, but is of poor quality, and made of cheap plastic. The point where the metal interface and the plastic housing connect is weak so it cracked, and now the metal interface part is wobbly."
2,"Nice Idea, but way too cheap",Bought this item because of three things.1. Price2. Keychain3. SwivelWhat I do not like about it:1. Cheap cheap cheap plasticThis product now falls into two pieces regularly (the circuit board and the plastic in two pieces...still functional but... not really.
3,"Works, but is cheaply made...won't last long","This USB flash drive works, but it is made of cheap plastic and is not robust. It would not last long if it were attached to a key chain containing other keys. It is not for carrying in your pocket. This device needs to be handled with care as it breaks easily."
4,I was lucky to find this book.,"I give this book four stars, not because of the writing style, nor even of the accuracy. As an historian, I was delighted to obtain a copy for my research. I know the country well, and knew the authors children. I was already familiar with some of the events, and I do feel the author used some artistic license in putting his facts together. As far as I know, there were only three books written by members of the Lynch Family with this being the earliest. I found it interesting to look for a common thread in them. I refer to some of what he says here in my own book, ""The Pleyto Hills.""I am very happy to have this book, because it tells things from the viewpoint of James Lynch. (I think.)The Pleyto HillsHungry Flats: East of LuciaThe Sheriff of San Lucas"
4,modeling clay,This is a gift requested for a soon to be 11 year old. She has not received it yet as it is a present.
4,Sure beats Playdoh.,"I got this stuff on sale and I love it! My mom was amazed too. It is spongy like rubber but it doesn't crumble all over. It is not sticky, crumbly, and gooey like Play-doh and doesn't dry flaky like Playdoh. It really beats Playdoh! You can mix colors for pretty pastels, oranges, or or browns or greens. You can even dry out thin things. I LOVE to press objects like beads in so they stick in the stuff. It bounces too, and stretches.The only thing I don't like is that you have to use all of a packet in one day or it dries out. Otherwise this is awesome!"
5,Great Product,"Crayola Model Magic is fun! We got this and were quite pleased with the lack of odor! It is not messy. Not only is it easy to shape, it retains it shape until properly stored or dried. Once dried, it is easy to paint and fun to play with. It makes very bouncy balls or bouncy coiled springs!My daughter made accessories for her Loving Family and Polly Pocket. We have made holiday ornaments and decorations for a spring.This product travels well. We have taken it on many plane trips. As stated, it does not have the odor of Play-Doh, nor the mess. I think the flight attendants and the other passengers liked that."
5,Magic Indeed,"My 10 year old loves this stuff. He sculpts characters and then writes stories about them so it's very high on our list of creative playthings. The white clay can be mixed with Crayola's washable markers to make other colors and the packaging keeps it fresh. Great for packing on trips, too!"
5,"Handprint ornaments, no mess!","I used this to make handprint ornaments for my one year old. She was squirmy and the model magic was super easy to remold every time she moved and warped her handprint (which happened quite a few times!) When it dries, it doesn't dry hard, it's more of a soft, foamy texture. I was easily able to paint her name and the date after it dried as well. I'm sure it'll be fun for her to make her own creations when she's older. It's not sticky, so there was no mess, loved this stuff!"
4,Model Magic Fun!!!,It is fun to play with and It can be used to do projects for school. You can also put it in the microvave(but not for too long or it will burn) if it is going hard.
4,"kids of all ages love this stuff, but its really expensive","Generally mess free fun for my kids. They love to spend time being creative with it. However, the packages are not resealable and will harden if not transferred to a waterproof sac or sealable plastic bag. The high price prevents me from buying more of it more frequently."
4,modeling compound,"I know the grandkids like it, but disappointed it didnt' come in sealable containers. Don't have any more words today"
3,Works,"This rack does the job but it's nothing to write home about. Amazon's description of a three-star rating pretty much nails it: It's OK. I've carried firewood, coolers, bicycles, etc without problem, so for that it does the trick.Problems:- Within a day or two, the hardware started rusting.- The rack is *very* loose inside the hitch receiver. I use ratchet straps to tighten it up on each side - there's no way it could be used without some sort of method of tightening it.- I wouldn't trust it with 500lbs! I can't put all of my weight on it without it protesting loudly, and any cargo must be balanced properly (which makes sense anyway). The grating that makes up the floor is pretty weak.- Note that it doesn't come with a retaining pin for the tongue in the receiver.In the end, it does the trick, and it's not too expensive. It was one of the few I could find that didn't have a rise on the tongue - I wanted mine to sit below the rear barn doors on my van, so the less rise, the better."
4,Soooommme Assembly required,"First, I must say, now that I've assembled the cargo carrier, I love it. Assembly, however was a pain because the screw holes did not quite line up. Maybe 3-4 of them max. I needed to loosly screw the ones that did line up then worked an awl or thin dowel into the others and bend the frame / support bracket till I could get other screws through. At this point some of them are kinda going through sideways, but as I tightened them they worked the support bracket enough to sraighten up.It works great for hauling mulch, the X-mas tree, gasoline, and all the other stuff which used to dirty the inside of the van. I also recommend the bike attachments if you are handy enough to drill new screw holes for them."
3,"good item-hitch to a truck or van, (too low for a car hitch)","This item works as it should but I have a car and when it is loaded and I drive over a bump or even just into a mall driveway the carrier bumps or scrapes the ground, so it should only be used on a truck or van where the hitch is high above the ground."
4,Renay,"I purchased this with the bicycle attachment. I thought it would be handier than a bike rack to fit in the hitch, with more verstile uses (and cheaper). I used it this weekend to haul my daughter's bicycle to my sister's. It worked out very well. I also had a cooler sitting next to it, which helped hold the bike in place better. I think I'll get some very good use out of it. My only complaint is that I feel that it wiggles a little too much in the hitch, but it is secure and won't come out."
5,great movie tunes,the music in this film was excellent. this soundtrack is a keeper! the irish melodies are enchanting...
5,Overhead Door compatible,10 seconds to program & compatible with Overhead Door Phantom model. Great opener for the price.
1,Not playable,This flute is awful. I could not play it at all because the holes were way too far apart. Only someone with freakishly long fingers could play this.
1,i dont,"It is not working at all and it was wrongly designed, so I highly recommend to others not to even consider buying it."
2,"If you like Dengue Fever, you still might not like Dieselhed","Cannibal CourtshipI'm a big fan of Dengue Fever and read that Zack (guitar) was also in Dieselhed. Zack is great in his Cambodian Surf Rock band, but Dieselhed is more of a generic alt-country outfit. The songs were fine, but nothing a guy with a good sized music collection would listen to a second time. I highly recomend Dengue Fever, though, which is some of the best music out there right now!"
4,It is a 1 foot long,It is a little over 1 foot long so it can fit the ankle up to 1 foot in circumstance. If all you need is a reflective strap that saves your pants while biking this is about the right price to pay.
3,Vicksburg book,"I bought this for a staff ride in Mississippi and of course this was required reading. I am not really into history and found this book to be hard to follow. I am not too familiar with Naval fleets and ended up having to stop in different parts of the book, go to an encyclopedia or dictionary and look words up cause I had no idea what they were talking about. I felt like I needed some kind of research before reading this book (this book has so much going on it too) my brain capacity can only take so much."
1,The Modern Film for Flowers for Algernon,I prefer the old version of Charlie Gordon. I find the new version to stray away from the original work of Daniel Keyes.
4,"Not the original, but a solid adaptation","I saw another review of this title by another teacher and felt that this would be a good version to show my eighth graders. There is one scene that probably pushes the school-appropriateness a bit, and I skipped over the scene, but the themes addressed are ones that my students could relate to after reading the short story version.I appreciated the humor and adaptations that were made, while keping pieces of the original, although few, intact."
2,Sometimes older is better,"The original movie Charly based on Flowers for Algernon is better ....though when I show it to my 8th graders, they do get a slightly edited version of it. (And I would have to do that with this version also.) I don't mind the very 60's film techniques--it's another learning opportunity, as is when ""Charles"" says that Dr. Nemur will be on the cover of Newsweek but Dr. Strauss will be a Playboy centerfold. It does require some discussion--if you're looking for a movie to pop in and forget, you won't get it with either of the versions here."
3,New Flowers for Algernon Movie,"The movie was ok...I teach 8th grade English and was looking for a new way to show this story in film...the older version, though dated, is a much better film. On the plus side, this one was made for TV, so it was very tame."
5,I read the book before I purchased the movie. The movie is good.,"I read the book before I purchased the movie. I loved the book. The book made me laugh and cry. After reading the book I was disappointed, because I really wanted Charlie to have a happy ending. When I saw the movie on Amazon.com, I decided to purchase it. The movie was very emotional."
1,90 minutes I'll never get back,"I will admit to being a little leery when a favorite story of mine gets adapted to the screen (be it a movie or TV), and ""Flowers for Algernon"" is on my top five list of best short stories of all time (the novel is another matter entirely). While I understand that no story survives this transition completely intact or unaltered, this movie should be used as a case study of what not to do when making an adaptation: everything that made the original such a heart-breaking record of Charlie Gordon's rise and fall has been gutted from this script. Charlie is barely sympathetic in this rendition, and Matthew Modine's lackluster performance is just the rancid icing on the tasteless cake. Avoid this one at all costs."
5,The Lost City,"We enjoyed tha authentic Cuban music, we should say the real Cuban music, when it had some meaning. That was an excellent production."
4,good marine adventure,"it was a very good book of warhammer I enjoyed it from cover to cover. Thougth I am a native spanish speaker and had to look up in the dictonary some of the naval words, I got envolved with the story and read it in only 2 weeks"
3,"Entertaining book, somewhat unhappy with cliche ending","This was a fun book to read. I enjoyed it, ordered more by the author, but was somewhat unhappy with how the book ended. There were some creative ideas, good action writing, and overall a pleasant way to pass a few hours.spoilers followthe too-predictable return of the lightning tree to the final battle was somewhat cliche, with Tusk dying as expected, etc. Is there anyone who didn't see this coming?Merely throwing the amulet overboard apparently undid all the magic at work.is this a pg-13 book? (maybe warhammer books are) pirates would be hitting brothels as well as bars on port calls, but apparently these towns don't have any? I don't read books for erotic or sexual content but some level of awareness is the human norm and it is a bit odd to read a book with none of it in places you would expect a lot of it."
5,Really Good,"This book was really good, and became an essential part to the Trilogy. It finally explains the Kjeldorans and Balduvians and about their part of the Ice Age. Although this book is not as good as the other two, I enjoyed it very much. It was a great introduction for the final and best addition to the trilogy. The entire series is an awe inspiring work of writing."
3,A disappointing effort by Grubb. Adds very little to the greater story.,"In my opinion, this book took a serious step down from the the previous one,The Gathering Dark. Where that one introduced and developed a great new character and a more MTG-faithful system of magic, this one simply tells a basic and almost generic story without adding much of anything to the MTG multiverse. While Grubb is undoubtedly a talented writer, and this book will entertain, I couldn't help but being somewhat disappointed by THE ETERNAL ICE. The story of Lim Dul's attempts to take over the world just seemed like a side story for the overall tale of Jodah, who wasn't really too involved in this book's outcome. The inclusion of a couple of Planeswalkers (especially Freyalise) added some to the book, but not enough to make it worth your while. Not recommended."
5,A GREAT Muench book,"Not that more to say than the title... This book contains many great photos made by a master, and the print quality makes justice to them (well, to confirm another review, there is one image that went too far on the reds, and has a deceptive burnt look - while many are great, and the splitND use is far more unobtrusive than Rowell's eg, with due respect ;o).Page layout is more conservative than in other Muench books I have (I think to Primal Forces, great images but layout on the kitsch side), and that suits me well."
5,Solution For A Peaceful And Better World,"I agree:How to make the world peaceful and better --The solution can be found in Dr. John Newton's ""Complete Conduct Principles for the 21st Century"". This is what people in the whole world need, especially now."
2,Shoddy Quality,Fan started buzzing on this card in just a few months after I installed it. I decided I'd rather give up my dual screens than listen to this thing any longer.
1,bump stopper 2,Can't still find the original in the market. It doesn't have colored print but black and white print on its body. That's the one that works.
3,"Bump Stopper-2 Razor Bump Treatment, Double Strength Formula - .5 oz","This product does not get the job done as I was expecting. I have used other products and to me, they work much better."
1,Cause my skin to rash up!,"I had tiny little bumps not many at all on each side of the back of my head..I get them every now and then from edging my hair. I put this product on both sides on the bumps. It caused both sides where i edged a week ago to swell and rash up in 24 hrs. I had large patches of rashes were i had used this product. My skin is not that sensitive, so whatever is in this is not safe ""for me anyhow"". I tried this product 3 times about 60 days apart just to see because i didn't believe it was causing the rash. After the third time ""now"" i cant even go outside... its embarrassing! Looks like i got bit by something that didn't cause puss bumps but inflamed skin.I'm a black guy/31/no history of sensitive skin. To get rid of rashes i been using hot towels to ease the itching and swelling as well as steroid cream ""Triamcinolone"". Also taking Benadryl."
3,"Good product for some, not all","I got this product through a recommendation from my brother. It had worked wonders for him. Now as I have extremely sensitive skin, i had never had bumps on my face until I used a razor, rather than the typical shave I get when I go get a haircut at the barber. This started the bumps problem. However, my brother has always had bumps, barbershop or not and this fixed it all.When I got around to trying it, it worked for a while and then stopped. I guess my skin got used to it and it wasn't as effective. It works for a bit but not as much as it should really and I'm sure the results will vary based on who is using it. My brother and I are both black, and so I again it will vary depending on the person.Thanks for reading!"
1,Testing may not be enough !!!!,"So got the product tested on hand for about a week. Said ok.Then placed it on neck are where the razor bumps were.After 2 days razor bumps are going away, but I HAVE A HUGE FREAKING RASH ON MY NECK.So testing may not be enough because different parts of the skin may react differently.If anyone has any solutions please tell me."
4,Excellent recreation,"If you enjoy the dance orchestras of the pre-1934 era, you will enjoy this faithful recreation of that style. Three of the tracks are wasted with the ""vocalizing"" by Garrison Keillor, but otherwise there are 18 good tracks of enjoyable music."
3,Interesting,"This was a very interesting alternative history but I could do without the over dramatic ""Hitlers Britian"" and burning iron cross every 3 minutes after the first couple times I almost stopped watching but I put up with it and finished watching."
1,Zzzzzz! Zzzzzz!,"Okay, this film must have been designed to be viewed on the television. There are constant interuptions throughout, which I can only imagine was where a commercial would have come in, with annoying exit and re-entry music designed to introduce commercial breaks made consentrating on the minimally interesting material difficult to follow, and impossible to enjoy.I bought this DVD sight unseen, and was sorely disappointed with it. I think worst of all was the awful musical score that interjected itself between scenes, or attempts at editing. I could never sit through this one again - not even if you paid me."
1,Want to See the Worst Film Ever Made?,"Obviously, this offering was filmed to be on television. The constant interuptions (to the film) with exit and re-entry music associated with commercial breaks made consentrating on the minimally interesting material impossible to absorb.Are the Producers proud of this film? It is so obviously a last ditch effort to milk a few bucks out of this imaginary documentary. If I had the power, I would burn all copies of the DVD and call a firing squad for anyone associated with the film."
1,"Look nice, but do not work well","These highlighters look and feel nice, but do not get the job done. Ink is weak and highlighter is noticeably lighter after only a few days usage (even when cap is kept on so marker doesn't dry out). This product used to be great. But I do not recommend it anymore - not worth the money!"
5,Bic comes through again. Great mileage from these pens.,"This summer, I took a seminar class which seemed to have more than its share of reading. I figured that with all the odds and ends highlighters I had laying around, that would be enough. Well, they weren't. Those fancy clickable ones (no separate caps) seemed to run out after a single long day of reading. I tried two different brands, and both seemed to last but one day. Even those giant old style highlighters with the fat barrel and fat nub didn't seem to last. So, I got this big pack of Bics. I am a month into a semester with four seminar classes, and I have not exhausted one of these little darlings. The only reason I'm buying another case is so I can have one case in my downstairs office, and one upstairs in the study, where I read (no computer)."
3,For the younger set,"My 11 year old loves to build things, and she loves Sponge Bob. She asked for all the Lego Spongebob kits for Christmas, and Santa delivered! She built all 3 of the sets within an hour. It was fun, but didn't last long. Sure she could rebuild the same thing over and over, but there's no excitement in that.I'd say this set is geared more to the 5 year old crowd just coming out of Duplo, maybe even younger if your child is dextrous enough to manage the tiny pieces."
4,Fun for a fan,"The big Spongebob fan in our house is 6-years old and he loves this set. Of course, it was too difficult for him to assemble, however, his 10-year old brother enjoyed working on it, though the subject matter was of no interest to him. While the Legos themselves are practically indestructable the finished products are typically fragile. A Spongebob fan who can take care of his or her playthings will enjoy this set. A child who is hard on his or her toys would be better off with a general set of Legos that can be broken down and reassembled with minimal fuss."
2,Kindle is horrible to her poetry,"My rating is not of the poetry. It is about the horrible shortcomings of the Kindle version of this book. According to this Kindle version of Phillis Wheatley's first book of poetry, she had no concept of line. We know this not to be true. In Kindle her work comes up as awkward paragraphs and strange indentations. I guess I shouldn't expect much for free, but come on... this is pretty much a waste of space if I am not looking at her poetry as *poems*."
5,love this product,"I have been drinking Vivaxl for two years and I love it. Taking B-vitamins in liquid vastly increases the speed and quantity of uptake. It not only gives me energy, but also makes me feel good all over. If you are hypersensitive to Niacin, you might not like he ""flush"". Personally, I like warm feeling that it gives me and, yes, it does increase sexual sensitivity."
1,1/4 of glas and threw it up,"I was given this by my chriopractor to try - and after dissolving the sachet and drinking 1/4 of a glass, in five minutes I threw it all up. I have no allergies, am not sick, and don't throw up unless I have the stomach flu. Be careful! I don't recommend this. I will stick w/my whole foods vitamins."
2,stuff tastes like sewer water!,"this stuff tastes really nasty. i felt a little bit of energy after drinking.. then the stuff gave me unbelievable gas. not worth it at all, and be careful if you have high blood pressure!"
3,"I like em, how about you?","As a fan of Tony Perkins the actor, I was intersted to see what this album sounded like. Perkins had been in musicals, but he never had professional training for his voice. He actually sounds pretty good, although he tends to have a waivering quality, or vibretto, in his singing. Tony Perkins recorded this record when he was a teen idol, and while he said that ""Nobody sold it, and as far as I know, nobody bought it,"" I would say buy this record, if not for Tony's voice, then for the novelty of having Norman Bates n'harmony.I especially like the track ""How about You"""
3,Okay,"The product was brand new and a bit cheaper than in most stores. I had no realized it was just the test sticks, you do need a monitor to go with it to use these. That part is well over $150.00 which I didnt realize."
1,DONT BUY THIS FROM ABC WHOLESALE,"ABC WHOLESALE will send you items in poor condition and if you want a refund they will respond to your emails snobbishly before blowing you off, dont trust them!!!"
3,good,It arrived quickly . I just thought it included the disposable moniter. I don't think I read the description properly. So I can't use it. : (
1,YOU NEED A MONITOR,"I know I drop the ball sometimes - but I did BIG TIME with this one - Apparently you need to buy a monitor for over $150 to put these sticks into in order to read the results. Now, because Amazon did not post a notice that this product is to be used with another additional machine, I have 30 useless sticks...."
5,Clear answers,We tried for years and this took the guessing out and we are now the proud parents of a baby girl!
1,bad batch,"Some of the strips din't work this box very unrealible. I think these may have been kept at wronge temp, because exp date was still good. This messed up the whole month ."
3,Not for women with irregular periods,"I have irregular periods so this product didn't work out that great for me. It takes at lest a cycle before it begins to read your body, my following period was early so it didn't know how to read me, therfore I never got a peak and it became a little frustrating. I'm sure people with regular periods will find it very helpful."
5,Great product!,Just want to let the ladies out there who are trying to conceive that this was the best purchase I have made. The monitor is accurate every month and the test stips work every time. I have had no problems.
5,Clearblue Easy Refills,Very easy to use. The refills include instructions on how to use them but more detailed instructions can be found on the Fertility monitor itself.
3,Very Easy To Use,"I bought this monitor on April 1st, 2011 and so far so good. If you follow the manual's instructions correctly its not a problem at all. I have also used the ClearBlue Digital Ovaulation Strips and got a few smiley faces but after 7 months of trying to conceive I am hoping this will be our lucky month. We are also trying the FertileAide for Men and Women and started these on April 1st as well. I am not one to write reviews but am very pleased with this monitor so far and hope it brings us some good luck! I will be back to write a 2nd review once it actaually does work!"
5,the monitor and test sticks work like a charm,i got pregnant with my first and second child using the monitor and test sticks. both times only required me using the monitor and sticks for 2 months.
2,"Be careful, MONITOR needed","I purchased the test strip by mistake. It is MONITOR test strips, and the monitor costs about $120!!"
2,Be careful about the compatibility,"I used this sticks for my Clearblue Easy DIGITAL Ovulation Test instrument, unfortunately the sticks doesn't work properly with this instrument. The smiling face does not appear, although the test stick has two blue lines on it."
1,Clear Blue Fertility monitor.,"This is completely opposite to what claimed by manufacturor. We were relying on the guidance provided by this monitor (As it is cliamed to be 100% accurate), but, after using for 8 months, once by conincidence we found out that: when this monitor showed there was no ovulation, the hormonal analysis from blood test and the sonogram suggested that there was ovulation. We lost 8 months of our struggle/stress because we relied on this stupid monitor alone."
3,Good,"I have used this item in the past with success. However, nothing is a sure thing when dealing with mother nature."
5,Don't be surprised,"Make sure you have the ClearBlue device to go with this product. It works, what more can I say."
5,first time,"Hey sticks did what they're made to do, this was my first month buying them, they could certainly be cheaper but really much much nicer than the regular opk's...."
3,"Works well, Amazon Price DOUBLED","Good product, works as intended. Have been using for over 3 years to avoid, using the Marquette Method of NFP (they have a special algorithm, don't just avoid on the high/peak days, just check out the MM. I'd like to know why I used to be able to get these for t.w.e.n.t.y o.n.e dollars with the subscribe and save through amazon, now it's almost f.o.r.t.y dollars. Why the major price increase?!?"
5,Great product,This product is easy to use. I have had great results in pinpointing ovulation with this product. If this is your first month using the product and your cycle is long plan on using more then 10 of the test strips. I found the first box to only last two cycles. Overall great product.
3,NEED KIT!,"Buy this only if you are ready to buy the testing kit which costs a lot more. Other than that, it seems to work pretty well, as we are expecting our baby next year! I use mine together with a fertility application on my iphone."
3,The monitor does NOT download to a PC,"Hello--I just wanted to inform everyone that the information does not download to a PC. I've had this monitor for a few months now and wanted to see my hormone information. I called the ClearBlue Easy number to find out how I connect the monitor to the computer to download this information and they said that you cannot download to a computer. Rather, they will send you a special card that you insert in the digital slot and then have to mail the card back to them. Once they receive the card they will print you the information. The catch? They can only do this ONCE per monitor. You can't even pay extra to do it consecutive times."
1,not working,"I seem to have gotten a bad box of test sticks. The monitor does not recognize them at all, i had to go out and buy a new box. The new ones work fine so I know it's not the monitor, must have gotten a bad box."
5,Review for Clearblue Easy Fertility Monitor Test Sticks,"I received these in a fairly quick manner. They were new in the original box, just as the description stated. I was very happy with this product. One of the least expensive places I've found to purchase these.I would purchase from this buyer again."
4,this monitor seems to work great,"These test sticks go with the electronic fertility monitor and both seem to really be much better at tracking my cycle. I do not have regular cycles, they are long, but the monitor has helped me determine when I am actually about to ovulate. I am on my 3rd month of using the monitor and have already been able to keep track of everything better. Using normal ovulation sticks was confusing and difficult, this monitor simplifies all the signals."
5,Good Deal,"Try finding these anywhere else for the price. Not going to happen. I already need another box, so I will be reordering this one."
2,Sticks were missing from box and some didn't work!,"I am frustrated, because there were 3 sticks were missing from the box and some didn't work! Other than that the product is fine. But for how expensive they are, I am upset."
5,Exactly like what you buy at CVS,"These are the exact same test sticks that you would buy at any drug store or big box store. The only difference is that these are $20 cheaper per box. Make sure you order before you run out, shipping is obviously slower than running to CVS to pick some up. I use the monitor for NFP so I go through a box every 2.5 months so the $20 savings is well worth waiting for shipping."
1,poor delivery service,I was not satisfied with the product because it took Amazon almost 2 weeks to deliver this product to me. I emailed Amazon's customer service department to complain about the delivery time but never got a reply. I would not order again from Amazon based on this experience.
4,No baby yet.. but still hopeful,I've been using this product for 3 months. It seems to be pretty accurate with my cycle. I gave it 4 stars because they are a little pricey. You must use the monitor along with this which is very expensive too.
5,Clear instructions and easy to use,The instructions are very clear. The box is easy to handle and very well packed. I hope the results come positive within the next month or so and then we'll have a baby!!
5,Getting a little Closer>>>>>>,"These Clear blue Strips is very Easy to use with the ClearBlue Fertility Monitor. I have only used 10 a month, so it does pay for it's self. I would highly recommend this and the monitor if you are trying to conceive. It take's alot of the Guessing out of the month's and alot of women is very suprised, at how they had a lot of there days calculated wrong and now understanding there ovulation day's a little better."
3,Usually a good purchase,I have lots of experience with the Clearplan sticks - every cycle for 4 years. This particular box had 17 of the 30 that were defective which meant that the most important part of the cycle the sticks didn't work and after you have peed on a stick and have no more pee you have lost the opportunity to do it again for another stick. No peak days detected last month which meant last month was a bust in the whole attempting to time a baby department. I'm sad - I did keep the box lid so I could write to the company and include the lot and production information.
5,clearblue easy fertilty monitor,I got mine from ebay new with a box of 30 test sticks for $140.I love it I was told my o days as well as 5 high days befor and this is my first month using it.I also used the clearblue digtals to just in case I dident get my o days from the monitor.we also got preseed this month to and used it on all my o days.If you want to know your cyles this is for you it realy does know your o days and leading up to them to give you the best chance to concive.we are in are the 2 week wait to see if we will have a baby I cant test until jan 10 so we will see I will update I am going to give this monitor three months to see what happens.I hope it works the first month like so many other people say It did. so we will see.look for my up date thanks
5,Help me understand my cycle in advance!!,"Great product! I am irregular, and with this, I know in advance, when my menses comes and when I am ovulating!"
4,"Tamblay's clear, fresh voice stands out.","Luis Tamblay's fresh voice stands out in Volumen Cero's Andromeda. This group is not a completely new sound; at least not yet. But there's quality here. Opening to most cuts sound thin, but overall, the arrangments are coherent and the tunes rythmic and memorable. The greatest strength is in the lead singer's crystal clear voice (a voice that sounds like it will only get better and better) and interesting lyrics presenting a young and incisive point of view. There's a detachment to the lyrics that serves as counterpoint to intense moments, remembering how he made someone cry or not remembering a face or a goodbye. That detachment also works well in presenting lots of sexual and space age imagery. Favorite cuts: La queen, Navaja, Monica's pullman."
5,One of the best VC albums!,This debut album went into obscurity since it was published and produced by the now-defunct Grita! Record Label. All fans of Volumen Cero need to get a hold of this album and listen to it. All of the songs are great and the guitar notes from Escuti are the best. Escuti left the band after Estelar. This is the original band line-up. I strongly recommend this album.
2,A mixture of stuff I've already heard before -no originality,"Volume Cero, formerly Orgasmic Bliss, puts out an album filled with cliches from the eighties. I was excited about their album coming out but dissapointed with it - extremely dissapointed... They label themselves as innovators but all they do is copy others."
5,SUPERPIMPINGANSTASTACKINHOESLAPPINDOPECRACKINCADDYLACKINCOUNTRYVERSATILEMUSIC,"THE PIMP IN & THE GANGSTA IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE C.D. IF YOU LIKE COUNTY MUSIC ABOUT RIDIN ON VOGUES , BENDIN CORNERS AND TWANKS ALSO SMOKIN DAT WOOD, THEN THIS C.D.IS THE FOR YOU. THIS WAS THE DIRTY BOYS FIRST C.D. BIG PIMP AND DA GANGSTA REPRESENT THE GUMP . AND THERE ALL ABOUT THAT COUNTRY VERSITLE. IF YOUR FROM THE SOUTH YOU WILL LOVE THIS C.D. IM FROM JACKSONVILLE FL AND WHEN THIS C.D. FIRST CAME OUT THIS IS WHAT ME AND ALL MY FRIENDS WERE LISTENING TO. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMENED THIS C.D."
5,The word from Texas.,"We feeling this album out here in Texas. These boys really put it down for the south. They got tight beats and, fire lyrics to back it up. The style is tight, and I'm loving that southern slang baby!! I been jammin' the album for a minute now, and it never leaves my changer. Rollin' Vogues, 6 deep creepin', Da' Land, man I could go on cause all the songs are on fire!!!Dat boy Jay out of D-town."
5,Versatile Southern Hip-Hop,"The second line of the first single, ""hit da floe,"" basically sums up dirty. ""you know we drop that versatile."" Damn is this cd fresh and different....These two fellas have what it takes to make it in the rap game....They shine on this CD with dope wordplay that is just fresh...THey got two different styles that go together nicely...On the production end you can say the same-fresh. The bass is definetly gonna rattle some trunks. Dirty represents the next phase in hiphop- No more copy cats....So fresh so Clean.....Go and cop that!!"
5,Tight Stuff,"This CD is the bomb. Finally something new comes out that doesn't sound like everything else that is currently on the top play lists. This song is gonna be big and BET already knows it because they just started playing the new song ""Hit Da Floe"" on the 106 & Park Countdown."
5,A Unique Alabama Sound,"The tricky part about Dirty is figuring out when to listen to them. It is strange music. The beats are often slow and dreamy with ghostly piano ringing in the back, and then suddenly The Pimp and Da Gangsta break out in a rapid fire flow that will make you say, ""What the hell is this?"" With a mixture of laid back pimpin' and hardcore Alabama crunk they create songs that conjure up images of muddy backroads with battered cadillacs cruising over them. It is music for hot days when all you want to do is sit down with some lemonade and fall asleep. There is an almost surreal sound to their songs that can either make you fall in love with them or pass them off as a bizzare regional sound that you will never identify with."
2,another DIRTY south cd.. wow,"this is another mindless dirty south album with mindless lyrics, repetitive catch phrases, basic loop beats with plenty of bass. If u like that kinda stuff then buy this album, its basically a cash$money or no limit record except with 2 diffrent ppl."
1,falls off,"Great sensation - in fact, close enough to the real thing that I didn't notice when it came off both times I used it. Pretty dangerous. I am larger than average size and the condoms fit snugly but the base is too loose so they slip off when we change positions or get into a good rhythm. If you want a condom that will actually protect you, don't buy this one."
3,"Fantastic sensation, but fragile. i prefer trojan supras","avantis are the best condoms for transmitting heat and sensation. they're as close as possible to wearing no condom at all.however, their quality control is lacking. while most packages of avantis have worked well for me, i have now encountered two packages of avantis where the condoms were difficult to unroll, and then broke during the act. that was enough for me. ever since then, i switched to trojan supras, and haven't had a problem with them at all. trojan supras are a little bit thicker, and transmit a little less sensation, but i'll take that over the risk of a broken condom any day."
3,This product performed about the same as similar ...,This product performed about the same as similar products. But it's more comfortable to use for those who are sensitive to latex. I'd recommend this product to friends and family.
3,Patriot lover,I am a big New England Patriots fan living in CA. I have to buy my team stuff online. I saw these pens and just had to have one. The pen writes nice and smooth. However I was a bit disappointed in the light up part. I thought it was going to be changing into multicolors. Its just lights up as blue. Other than that the pen is great
3,Singing Fluff,"Three stars is generous.As I read, I found myself desparately wanting the plot to move along and get to the point. The plot idea was interesting, but the author wasn't very adept at fleshing it out. The characters don't generate sympathy and the plot twist at the end seemed very contrived. I got the feeling that the author didn't quite know how to end it, so she just plopped the ending in, leaving me thinking ""Are you serious??"" Some authors excel at plots with interweaving characters; not this one.I'm bothered by a book that could have been really good but isn't. Luckily, I borrowed this from a friend and didn't spend any money on it.I'd only recommend this if you want some fluff reading that doesn't require a lot of brain power."
2,Where's the Clash?,"While the 12 pages of the book that actually contain info on the Clash are cleverly written (if you like British humor), there is far too little of it. I guess seeing the cover - a great pic of Strummer, with the promise that the author will ""kill my idol"" - got my expectations up too high. This book is basically a few pages of quick chronology/bio/the clash ripped everyhting off from the Sex Pistols then took off for the U.S., followed by about 50 pages of discography. What the ??Let's hear more about each member, let's have interviews, let's have talk about politics, specific lyrics, influence, etc. While brevity is key to punk itself, it kinda sucks in a book about an awesome band that lasted over a decade and had a huge impact on modern music.And what makes Quantick qualified to declare humself a Clash authority is never explained - but I think that's the least of this books shortcomings."
1,Quantick is a hack.,"One of the sad bits about Rock Journalism is the absence of journalism. Quantick can't help himself as he interjects glib opinions and drops pop-culture references that are as irrelevant as they are dated. The book is, in itself, a fair, brief chronological history of the band. What is missing is any real words from the members of the band themselves; instead we get Quantick writing about what others have written about the band and his opinions and judgements over the band in a redundantly formatted opinion piece. He belies his subject by interjecting himself into the material. There's nothing here that can't be gleamed from other sources (fansites, etc) and no original insights. The Clash were a significant collective of artists producing relevant materials. Quantick is hack who makes the material unenjoyable."
1,Do NOT waste your money!,"I love the first three HP movie tie-in games. This one, I have sent an e-mail to EA requesting a refund. The controls are terrible (and unchangeable), the response time is beyond sluggish. It is difficult to get your character to face the correct way, I often find myself walking into fires I was just trying to head towards to put out (and talk about slow, my hands will have been off of the keyboard for several seconds when my character takes that plunge).For all practical purposes, this game is unplayable. I cannot believe that someone in testing didn't say, ""We've got to scrap this altogether and start over.""I do want to make this clear: I am writing this regarding the PC version using a keyboard. I have no idea what other platforms are like for this game.I think EA needs to recall this game and try again."
1,Very bad,"Big letdown. Been waiting to get it for christmas. I never knew that EA made such bad games. The big problem is that it doesn't use the mouse. You are forced to use arrow keys for movement, and there is no way to change the controls. The most difficult part of the game is figuring out the main menu."
1,Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,I love the Harry Potter games but this one was so hard to contal I love the pic and the plots but again the contal was so hard.
2,6th out of 8,"After playing the first 7 Harry Potter games I assume the 8th will be just like the 7th which in my opinion puts them as the 7th and 8th best of the 8. However just before those two was this one. The first three had the right idea, It might have been childish and easy to beat quickly, but at least I felt like I was at Hogwarts. This one is a pick your level and all based around a menu screen. You have to play a lot of the levels multiple times, and the reward system is pretty awful. I do like the idea of Hermione and Ron helping you but everything else about this game made it the 6th worst of the 8. Sorry GOF, thankfully the 5th one returns to the free roaming idea, and its in my opinion the best of the 8."
1,Not very fun,"I bought this game because I thought it would be a similar game to the first 2 Harry Potter ga enjoyed very much, but this one is much different and, in my opinion, not fun. The game can either Harry, Ron, or Hermione, which I thought would be great, but the way the camera follo difficult to see who's who. The camera only sees one angle and will not turn, so it is more frus amusing and the camera is so zoomed out that you can't tell where your character is in many casting feature is very weak in this game, as it doesn't always work and when it does, its more than an actual aimed attack. It got a little better after I got the controls down, but it wasn't wo spent on it. I haven't played it since my first few attempts to enjoy the game...I just started pla else. I saw no point in dealing with the frustration, video games are supposed to be fun!"
1,Even simple games are better than this,"This is a pretty poor port from the game consoles. The game doesn't support the mouse at all - which is almost unheard of for point of view games like this one. And, even though it supports three players and the graphics are good, the overall lack of control leaves you wondering where the money went.If you want to play this, buy it off the used racks - it should be there within a few weeks for about $5.00."
2,Not that good.,"You're not able to go through the castle and other places, just the levels, so it's not that fun. It's not that good, you get very busy playing it, but, well...I think that the other games are better, at least you get to go through Hogwarts. Better buy another game, and believe me, it's true!I have the entire collection of games from Harry Potter, and this is the worst, you don't even play quidditch, the entire game is based on levels.It has good graphics, PERFECT GRAPHICS, but they should do this game better. In my opinion, Thethird is the best, but the first has horrible graphics.[...]"
3,"Disappointed,","As all other people, I was disappointed. There's no exploration like in the Chamber Secrets and the Sorcerer's Stone (they kind of messed up on the Prizoner, but it was still good). I was so excited on getting this game-the book is the best, so the game must be the best! But no, it's just a game for murdering pyromaniacs who can't find anything to kill so they kill stuff on their computer.It was still quite good, and addicting. You get used to the controls after a while. But the whole idea of the levels was completely messed up, too arcade styled.Still think worth buying, but buy the others first."
1,Worst of the lot,"I agree with other reviewers, this is definitely the worst of the four games so far! Don't waste your money! The perspectives are terrible, the directionals haphazard and the overall quality of the game is very low because of it. Obviously EA continues to try to capitalize on the HP phenomenon, and every attempt up until this one has been good, but this one is definitely a miss."
1,terribly dissatisfied,"someone call the company and tell them to redo the game it was so bad. there is no story, no easy way to control the charectors, and no easy way to cast spells!!!!!"
1,DISSATISFIED,IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A GAME LIKE THE OTHER HARRY POTTER GAMES YOU ARE IN FOR A BAD EXPERIENCE. THIS GAME HAS NO REAL INTERACTION WITH CHARACTERS LIKE THE OTHERS THERE IS NO FEELING LIKE YOU ARE THERE RELIVING THE MOVIE. ALL THIS GAME HAS TO OFFER IS RUNNING AROUND AND KNOCKING THINGS OVER AND SLAYING THINGS. NO REAL BEAUTY IN THIS ONE AND EA HAS FAILED ON THIS GAME TERRIBLY. SORRY I SPENT THE MONEY. LINDA
3,What's Wrong???,"Ok, This Harry Potter Game Is WAYY Different Then The Other Games. The Controls Are Horrible And You Can't Even Point A Spell In The Right Direction. I Mean I Just Got The Game On Christmas Eve and I Jumped Right On The Computer To Play It.Oh My Gosh I Was SO Suprized. I Didn't Like It That Much. The Game Is Weird. You Don't Talk To Anyone At All And You Never Push Buttons To Open Doors Or Battle People To Get Father Into The Game. Ok For Example, If You Have TO Battle A Big Boss And It's Hard To Beat Him , All You Have To Do It Walk Through The Door. And In The Other Games Maybe Only One Character Knew How To Do A Certain Spell But In This Game Everyone Knows How To Do Every Spell. Which Brings Me To Another Point. In This Game You Can Switch Players. You Have To Stick Which That Same One For The Whole Level. And If You Die You Die. You Can't Switch Players Right Before You Die. Sry For Writing So Much.{:}"
1,DOESNT EVEN DESERVE 1 STAR,1.It is incredibley hard to move aroundd.2.you cant explore(you just choose what level you want)3.THEY CANT EVEN JUMP! what fun is that?4.it gave my computer lots of viruses5.dont waste yor money on this I saved up for it and i regret it 100%
1,Unlike every other HP game that has been released... saddly..,"Unlike every other HP game that has been released... saddly..I enjoyed the last 3 HP games, so much so that I would sit and play them until they were complete. They were fun little games, secret areas to explore, colorful graphics and fun side games. This game lacks all aspects of the previous. It's not fun, the controls are difficult at best,and there is no mouse support.I can only hope that EA learns from their mistake and takes this back to it's original charm of the first three.In a few words, if you want to play a fun Harry Potter game, buy the first three games and enjoy.. avoid this one at all cost."
2,challenging for wrong reasons,"i have the previous 3 games the first 2 on PC and the 3rd on Xbox. they were all excellent games, the 3rd being a little too easy, so i bought this expecting a good game. the only good thing here is the graphics. the most challening part of the game is controls. spell casting is a nightmare, i always forget which button is for what, very linear gameplay. Don't buy this save your money and watch and/or read the book. Hopfully EA fixes these problems for Order of the Phoenix"
1,Muggles are RIght!,"I have to agree with most of my fellow reviewers. This game is the worst! There is no mouse control,like the previous games, so you have to use the up and down arrows on your keyboard to move the wizards. With no mouse, it is very hard to manage the games speed and the spells and Jinxs(?) and confusing to the average player. Nothing like the last 2 games! Wanna buy mine Cheap?"
3,This one isn't as good as the others,It's hard to get used to this game and hard to control where you are shooting your spells. There are no directions that are really helpful.
3,Controls not explained!,"Let me start off with the good things:-the graphics are phenomenal-you can choose your characterNow, the bad things:-unlike the other HP games, you CANNOT wander around the Hogwarts grounds, which I enjoyed.-The mouse has NO action whatsoever, not even in the main menu!-I get stuck on so many levels, because most controls are NOT EXPLAINED! Not even in the manual!-your ""friends"" (whoever you're not playing with) are so slow in following you and are almost always occupied with sneezing or wandering around when you need help so badly!-I tried to install this game for one full year and never got it to install until I did some tricky thingsOverall, I would have rated this game five stars if the bad things were fixed.I think that EA Games was just porting over a Play Station game (I can tell by the graphics style) and not bothering to make it anymore convenient. EA did a poor job here. I would sort of recommend this game."
4,get a gamepad,"there is no mouse option with this game, and the keyboard funcationality is limited. get this gamepad if you wish to enjoy this game:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00030AX3Q/102-5398870-4967354?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v;=glance&n;=172282very frustrating game without it."
2,Bad ESRB rateing,"I have not played this game before but I think it got a bad rateing, I think this place called ESRB made it that rateing, I bet it is scarrey for 8,9,10,and 11 year old kids! But I bet It is very challenging and has good graphics, FOR THE OLDER GAMER!"
1,Doesn't Cut It,"If you enjoyed the first few games at all you're wasting your time with this. It gives no freedom to explore, but instead confines the game to 'levels' more suited to a first person shooter than what should be an adventure rpg. It also plays in the style of a shooter, but with less direct control of your character. Your only real options are to shoot at things, pick things up, and make them come at you. There is hardly a story and it doesn't even pretend to give you the usual mystery to solve, it is simply attacking and running away without the small level of skill required in previous games.There is no exploration, there are no conversations, there is no skill. If you have any desire to avoid melting your brain from mindless and pointless attacking then save yourself the trouble and don't waste your money on this game."
2,Not having fun playing this game,"Like the others I am also very disappointed with this game. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the graphics. If like me you buy both the console and PC versions because they are different games, forget it, they are completly the same game. The controls are awful and you feel like your watching everything from a tower. I feel EA should redo this game and we should all write to them and tell them so. Who ever OK'd this game for release should be sent to Azkaban for life."
1,Wish I could give it zero stars!,"This is nothing like the first three games. You can't walk around Hogwarts, you can't use the mouse, you can't talk to other students, etc. Really stupid game! The graphics are great, but who cares when all you have is pictures and no real game?! Dumb designing. I can't believe it's the same company as designed the first three. I'm so sad. I love all three of the previous games and replay them over and over again. I pre-ordered this one. Never again!"
1,ABSOLUTELY SUCKS!!!,"I'm extremely disappointed in this game. The controls just don't work. I checked the system requirements before I bought it, and according to the box, I have them. But the game still doesn't work well, AT ALL. I love the previous HP games, but this is a big failure."
2,just not as good as the other Potter games,seems like this one got rushed out for some reason. my daughter who loved all the other Potter games lost interest after playing twice.
4,Ok at times,"I enjoyed playing this game, but I think it is a little boring. And a lot of it is hard. I also think that it takes to long to advance levels. And also in a lot of ways, it is just like the other games. Of course, it is different. But the general guideline is the same. The spells are the same. Plus, if you read the instruction booklet for help, it is very poorly written, at least for 10 year olds to understand. The game is sometimes fun. But it does get boring."
3,Beware,"This is an awesome game but, its controls are terible! I am giving you a warning if you like your character walking in reverse as you point it forward or other stuff like this buy this game. If you dont, dont buy this game!!!!!! Otherwise, it's awesome!!!!--From a Fellow Gamer"
1,HP Goblet of Fire,I am outraged at the new HP game. Below are some reasons why:* In the new HP game you can't even point Harry in the rite direction!!!!!* Also there isn't any order to the game at all!!!!!* In this game Ron and Hermione don't help Harry very much.This game is a must NOT play!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,This game sucks.,"I absolutely LOVED the first three games because the characters were easy to move and the levels were entertaining. I really was looking forward to the new one, but like so many others reviewers stated, was really disappointed at how horrible the graphics were. If you really want to buy this game, buy it for a PS2 where it was originally designed for. Movement is very difficult and it took me a lot longer than the other games to get used to. I hope they redo this one and re-release it. To the folks at EA: remember the saying ""KISS"".Bottom line: If you must have it, buy it and play it on PS2. The PC version is a waste of money."
1,Please Please Don't Waste Your Money,"My daughter and I have played and replayed Harry Potter 1-3, spending hours in thorough enjoyment. This one is TERRIBLE, AWFUL and HORRIBLE! Impossible to control your character, move, cast spells, explore and all the other things that made the previous games fun. We hope EA reads these reviews and offers to refund or redo this game. You'll want to throw your computer out the window after about 5 incredibly frustrating minutes!!!"
2,Ehhh!,"Oh, why didn't I come here and read the reviews first!? I would have saved my almost 30 bucks.I quickly bought this game because I had fun with the previous Harry Potter games (mostly 1 & 2), but once I installed this latest one, and tried to play it...well, it was one big mess. The reviews are true: the controls are positively atrocious! Here I am banging at my keyboard controls, trying to make Harry go this way when he goes the OTHER way--and he doesn't stop. He keeps on running until he hits something. I thought it was just my computer-until I realize that many people are having the same problem. Oh, by the way, there is NO mouse support control. Everything is ""simplified"", so even the option menu is bare minimal (autosave and subtitles choice only). After a while, it got too frustrating, so I chunked the game.I don't recommend this game--at least a full price. Don't be fooled like I was. You might have better luck getting the gaming system version."
1,Throw this game in the goblet of fire.,"Apparently EA Games decided it would be wise to sacrifice fun for the sake of graphics. I loved the first two games in this series and liked the third (though not as much as the second). Goblet of Fire is completely different. To start off with, the controls are so different from the previous three games that it takes some adjusting. Once you have adjusted, though, you realize that the game is nowhere near as challenging or fun as the first three. The visuals are better, sure, but who cares if the game is no good? I miss being able to control the angle, explore on my own, use the mouse, etc., etc., etc. Plus, this game costs a lot more than the others did!! I wish I had that money back."
1,Shame there's no Zero star rating,They've got to be kidding. It isn't a PC game its an arcade game or ought to be. The user controls on this game are so unfriendly that even my husband the computer genius of the family washed his hands of it after 10 minutes. My 13 yr old daughter loved the first three games but wants her money back for this one. No one in my house wants to play it except my four year old son and he keeps expecting us to fix it.
1,"Oh, the Horror!!","Why, oh WHY did I not read all the reviews first? This game is absolutely horrible. I have played all the Harry Potter games for the PC and for the consoles. This game is nothing like the others. For the love of all that is good in the wizarding world, stay away from this game!!! I want my money back EA."
2,Deeply Disappointed,"I am big Harry Potter fan and i loved the previous games in the series.So naturally i thought i'd get another worthwhile fun experience with Goblet of Fire but sadly i was wrong. One thing i really hated about this game were the cut scenes, they are just a bunch of static pictures instead of a video. Plus you never get to see other Hogwarts students other than Ron, Harry and Hermione, in my opinion it makes it feel as if you're the only students in the school. Lastly there is absolutely no exploring Hogwarts castle or its grounds, the game is a very linear experience. It's obvious that EA was trying to cash into the Harry Potter craze by producing this game with the least bit of effort to make as much money a possible. DON'T BUY THIS GAME YOU'RE BETTER OFF WITH THE PREVIOUS GAMES."
1,Harry Potter: Goblet of Fire for PC,"I was very disappointed with this game and I haven't even completed all the tasks yet. I'm still stuck in the Forbidden Forest and this game is trying my patience. The makers seemed to have sacrificed ease of motion for better graphics. One minute one is running up a flight of stairs and in the next moment a tree is in the way obscuring the view. There aren't many choices to play with, with respect to keys for movement or for casting spells etc.Compared to the 3 other games Goblet of Fire seems to be a letdown. If you choose to be frustrated by buying this game then I wish you the best of luck."
2,Disappointed,It became clear to me that this game was not meant for the pc in the first 5 minutes of playing. The perpsective is awful and charms are terribly hard to cast... the game made little sense when starting out and was hard to follow.
1,What were they thinking???,"I have All of the other Harry Potter PC games, and I love playing them still, but this one was horrible. As many of you are aware, the first PC game (Sorcerers Stone) was good but needed a little improvement. When the second one came along it was even better, and I think the third one was better still. I had high hopes for Goblet of Fire, but it was very dissapointing. Just moving your player in a straight line is a challange, directing spells is just as problematic, and I would say my biggest complaint is that you can't ""look"" very well. What I mean by that is you used to be able ( in the previous three) to kind of ""pan-scan"" the area so you could check everything out. This version has a very limited viewing range and I just don't like it. I find that these things to be so irritating that I have given up even trying to play it."
4,An interesting view of life on the other side,Luftwaffe aces had huge numbers of victories. Of course most of these were achieved on the Russian front. It is somewhat amazing that any of the major German aces survived to the end. I enjoyed this book a lot.
3,Luftwaffe Fighter ace,Pretty good. He did not talk about all of his air kills but went through his life too quickly. Book was too short.
4,Luftwaffe Fighter Ace,"Very similar to Heinz Knoke's ""I flew for the Fuhrer"" but most of Norbert's combat was on the Eastern Front whereas Knoke flew in the West. Very revealing insight into the post war chaos in Germany."
3,Ok,"I found this book to be disappointing and poorly researched. Glad I checked it out of the library first before purchasing it on amazon. It is thick. (And I might add, longwinded and pointless IMO.)I'm still waiting for a 'good' book on colour history.(There seems to be a fashion these days among art or design majors to go and write a book after their degree to make themselves look important. Forget honesty, good research and trying to present a subject on it's own for it's own sake.)I have no problem with people wanting to make a living out of what interests them, (and even what they may be very good at) but not at the expense of the general public."
5,The President's Man Double Feature,I have been a great fan of Chuck Norris for a long time and really appreciated being able to buy a copy of a made- for-Tv movie I couldn't find anywhere else. It arrived here as scheduled and in great condition. Thanks.
4,A Line in the Sand,"If you like Chuck Norris, you will like this TV Movie. He has a knack of always knowing what to do in any situation. As a fellow martial artist, I appreciate all of the different training techniques and styles demonstrated in this one."
3,A little heavy,"I was expecting something a little like other Scandinavian detective authors (Nesbo etc) but this is much deeper and more psychological. While this is fine in principle I found the reading a little heavy for what is essentially a light story. But for the most part the story was well written and imaginative. It became a little far fetched towards the ending. In terms of readability on an e-reader I found single paragraphs extending over 2 pages with content that did not warrant such detail - e-readers are not good with solid text from top to bottom, whereas they can work better on a printed page."
1,Telemark,"I thought The Indian Bride and The Caller were the most well crafted mysteries I've read and gave them 5 stars.This book mystifies me. It is as if it were written by a completely different person. Firstly, the plot strained credibility. How can we believe that a woman's best friend's son would break into her house intending to rob her and neither one of them give any indication of recognizing each other? Other coincidences were far too facile. Then too, the writing is not nearly as tight and the characters are shallowly imagined.Heretofor, reading Karin Fossum was akin to following a skillful skier swoosh down a snowy mountain trail. What happened? That's the real mystery!"
3,Depressing,"I love the Inspector Sejer books, but this one really depressed me. I also thought that the flow of the story was stilted in some indefinable way. To each his own, but...ehhhh."
3,Solid crime novel,"Nothing fancy, but well structured and engaging. Explores the psyche of characters, which allows the author to explore the grey areas - no-one is completely innocent (certainly not the victim), no-one completely evil, and nicely placed small twist at the end."
5,Karin Fossum is my new favorite author!,"I am an avid suspense/mystery/thriller reader. Karin Fossum's books haveeverything -- including a clear writing style that keeps you involved withthe characters. The plot with its twists and turns leave you wanting more!Her understanding of human nature is unusually accurate -- no one acts out of character.In When The Devil Holds The Candle. Ms. Fossum starts out with a simplepurse snatching that escalates to breathtaking levels with horrifyingconsequences. Her detective, Inspector Sejer, is remarkably intelligent,intuitive and totally interesting."
5,Wow! what a scary story!,"This is the 3rd or 4th book that I've read by Karin Fossum and I was truly creeped out by this one. Being of Norwegian decent, I love that a Norwegian woman wrote this. I guess that I shouldn't be surprised, but I didn't know she was out there and I love it! Read it if you love suspense and mysery."
2,Gloomy Norway Crime Story,"After enjoying the Stieg Larsen Millennium Trilogy, that I have read mostly on long international flights, I have been looking for more crime stories that make great reads on planes. Although the Larsen books have a fair amount of violence, they seem to offset it with the positive Swedish atmosphere and the super powers of the heroine. In this book however, there is only gloom and doom and everything is so negative that it was hard for me to read. The story is well written and I finished the book, and for people less sensitive to negativity this might be a good read, but I simply didn't like it. I don't want to go into too much detail as not to spoil the book for new readers, but I think I didn't enjoy this book because I don't like to read about people being in a helpless situation without a chance of escape or getting help."
3,too slow,"doesn't hold your interest. too much description, not strong enough story. the whole story probably could have been written in less than 10 pages"
1,I was disappointed as well,"While I have been an admirer of Karin Fossum's books [the Indian Bride a particular favorite], this one was truly a disappointment. There is practically no ""detecting"", inspector Sejer appears, but we hear more about how he feels, his dog and his girl friend than his job. For that matter, the girl friends, a psychiatrist, is herself a little strange [phone sex to strangers for fun?].The characters never get interesting: a dumb young man, his bizarre, asocial friend, a woman you realize after a while is insane...The whole story is gloomy, depressing, and essentially pointless."
4,"Pertinent and informative, casts a cloud over the future...","As someone who's witnessed the day-to-day lives of Israelis firsthand and observed the ongoing rift between the secular and religious camps, I was extremely interested in hearing what the author had to say about the situation. This book confirmed my own observations and fears: that the split between the religious and the secular in Israel is becoming a problem that may eventually outweigh the Palestinian crisis in terms of practical consequences. Is there any hope for reconciliation? Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that way.Minus one star for atrocious punctuation."
3,Be prepared to use more than one tablet per cup,"Perhaps because I was looking for a calorie free alternative to the corn syrup stuff, I thought I would try these.They are ok but......I just use 3 per large cup and some cream.One tab just didn't do it for me :)I want to try the (French-Vanilla-Stevia-Powder-Packets) next.I got some from a local grocer and I only need one pack per cup.Yum-it-up! :)"
5,Great alternative to Batman and the like!,"The Bibleman series is entertaining, though clearly low-budget, and engaging for children as young as 3 years old. My 5-year-old son is enthralled with Bibleman, and the themes of the DVDs teach important lessons for those of us trying to raise thoughtful, Christian kids in an increasingly non-Christian world."
1,Really bad,This book is really bad. Not worth the money or the time. A lot of cliche and not much useful information.
1,A delightful book,This delightful book pulls no punches about aging and the problems associated with growing old. This author seems to know the secrets to aging gracefully and tells her story with great humor. This is a very funny as well as helpful book.
5,Great advice and a fun read!!,"Marion Downs is a treasure! You needn't be ""old"" to read this book; and if you think you're old, it's likely she'll change your mind. Don't miss this one!"
4,"Needed a spare lens cap, and this met my need","Lost a lens cap, needed a lens cap. This is the lens cap that I needed. There may have been a less expensive no-name cap, but I wanted the real thing."
5,Perfect fit lens cap,"This is the genuine Canon lens cap, just like the one I lost. It fits my Canon 28-135 lens perfectly. The free shipping did not delay the delivery time at all. The lens arrived quickly and was in its original packaging."
2,A little deep for kids,"I found this product to be a little deep for kids, and it mainly just contains pretty basic Buddhist parables. I can find the same parables online and by my estimation, they charged way too much for the book."
3,Short stories,The stories are not presented in a manner that would engage a child - in fact they did not engage me either.
5,The Book Bash Review,A beautiful book! A simply delightful read to share with your children. The moral lessons reach far beyond what we usually try to instill in our children.
2,Wish it was not mine,I HAD STARTED READING THIS BOOK AND I WAS DISAPPOINTED EVEN THOUGH IT HAD SOME HOT SCENES THE PLOTS WAS BORING AND BLAND. BECAUSE IT COSTED A GOOD AMOUNT OF FUNDS I MADE MYSELF FINISH IT. I LOVE READING IT IS MY JOY AND MY ADVENTURE BUT THIS BOOK NEEDED TO BE PUT IN MY SHREDDER. MY BOOKS ARE MY FRIENDS BUT THIS TIME I RECEIVED A LEMON INSTEAD OF AND APPLE
1,Bad information,"Keep looking. This guide is full of incorrect information and therefore, nearly useless."
1,New Can Design is cumbersome,"I have used Dust-off for years, but a while back they changed the design of the sprayer mechanism on the can.I find the new design to be shoddy and not reliable.What happens is that the trigger mechanism doesn't reset itself after a puff, (which is what normally allows the can to recharge to full pressure). So, instead of having the ability to fire multiple, powerful blasts of air while cleaning/dusting your equipment...what you get is one big blast of air followed by several very small puffs of air.As far as I'm concerned they have ruined a good product with this ""new"" can design. I won't be buying Dust-Off anymore, but will be looking for an alternate product."
5,Great for computers,"I'm the bad sort of person who likes to eat/paint/do deskwork/etc all at my computer. As such my keyboard tends to be home to all manner of small wayward particles.Dust-off works great, really is strong and knocks stuff out. Also nice for little grooves in your mouse or CPU that like to hold dust. Comes with a little straw attachment if you need to get into super small or hidden areas.Only negative thing is that due to the pressure/liquid->air process, the can gets VERY cold if used for a long period of time. It warms up quickly enough, but be cautious as it can cause some minor frostbite."
5,Good Source of Omega 3 and 6,I take this daily as a source of Omega 3 and 6 oils. It has a peppery taste and works well.
4,Unforgettable,"The narrative of this book and the way the story is told is in itself like the momentous and horrific imagery it describes: brief, intense, and so loaded with detail that one later finds oneself reliving what one read over and over again, as though it was a violent memory of something tragic and recent. A short novella, but all the more vivid and memorable for that. Superb prose, unique perspective, an altogether unforgettable ""memoir."""
4,Still Great. ** 7,I enjoyed this book and have seen some of the writer's other works. He is an excellent novelist and poet. It has been a few years since this book and it is a shame that he has not written more. I hope he will publish some of his wonderful poetry.**7
5,Lost romantic gems,"Captain Hollywood must have done something wrong to the Gods. The first few singles were the best of romantic dance-floor anthem, then they disappeared and were impossible to find in the stores. The singles combined powerful songs and compelling dance grooves. Where did they go? These are some of the best party-pushers of all time. As a sometime dance producer, I would have been proud to have these in my resume."
1,Sucky book,I really hated this book because it was stupid and unrealistic. I learned nothing from this book even though I read it for school. I guess taking detailed notes and writing literary responses to each and every chapter makes the book seem worse. I didnt really like that it was unrealistic because I like realistic stories. That way I can relate to them. I have nothing in common with the characters from these stories and it was easy to fugire out the moral of each story. I find it easy to tell poeple not to read this book. EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!![unless you're obsessed with Africa . . . : )]
2,Asterix and the Actress,This book was written by the illustrator of the Asterix books and not the original author (who died).He draws beautifully but his writing skills are mediocre.
1,Terrible,"Uderzo is a master artist but a horrible author. The humor of the originals is completely absent, and the plot reads like it was thought up by a four year old. I never thought I'd give a bad review to an Asterix, but this is just disappointing. Save your money for the originals."
5,The BEST Book I've Ever Read!,"This is what I would consider the best book I have ever read, and believe me, I read alot of science fiction and fantasy. I also enjoy reading Physics, Cosmology, Space and other Science books. This book has many interesting theories as to how we may evolve, and to the kind of technology that we may develope. It would be a good choice as to a book to read."
4,Action is good; a little less brooding by central char.,"The Orion series has been around for quite some time and I've found the science to be plausible, and the action is nonstop. Orion's brooding over the woman he can't have is a bit overdone."
3,This is pulp Sci Fi,"When I started the book I was hooked. After a hundred pages I caught on to the plan: A big battle in which many of Orions troops get killed except his girl, and after which he has a short episode with the big god who tells him little. Through the book it becomes clear that he will be loyal to his troops, pine after his love, who he never seems to see, and deal with the overgod. No suspense, only the continual introduction of plot elements that seem impossible, but you know that he will succede with. This book, and probably the whole series, could have been condensed into one large book. It's a good thing I got mine from the library, because I would not want to have to pay for this. I guess its ok for someone just starting in SF, but for so decorated an author I expect more. This is pulp science fiction, pure and simple."
2,Concrete and Dry,"As a reader a few ""light"" histories of the era, I have a passing familiarity with the chronology, personalities, and issues of the time. None of this prepared me for the obscurity of Professor Schwartz's book. It reads like a doctoral thesis; short on description, long on concrete assertions and refutations of such. It's hard to read and hard to appreciate unless you are a REAL student of the time and are throughly familiar with the subject matter. I was so disappointed with how dense this book is that I'm stunned that it's being recommended for the casually interested history reader."
4,Pretty Good Compilation of Barricada's Best,"This CD compiles the best hits of Spanish band Barricada. At this price, it's a bargain. Punk fans ough to enjoy it.My favorite tracks are:Deja Que Esto No Acabe NuncaEn Blanco y NegroNo Sé Bien Por QuéRojoSin Poderme EncontrarTodos Mirando"
3,good but not great,"I purchased this and although it does motivate me to want to move, the 1st part of the CD with the hynotis part, he is talking which does nothing to relax me or motivate me. I skip that part and go directly to the subliminal part. You will want to exercise."
2,still not motivated,got this ages ago and could not find the motivation to listen to more than a few minutes. Gave 2 stars because that is probably my fault!
4,Overall a wonderful text for guided- or self- study!,"I studied Russian in some capacity for almost 5 years now. As a russophile one runs into many text that offer little explanation to make this complex language more easily understood. This book is certainly not one of them! The Grammar review sections are perfect whether you are advancing your study by yourself, or you are reviewing for a test in a class. The vocablary sections are complete and well organized. This the second Golosa book focuses even more on authentic texts than the first volume. My only complaints include: the glossary--it is not a complete enough to serve as a useful tool; the cultural sections--on rare occasion are not complete enough to avoid broad generalizations; and the illustrations are childlike and not always clear. Nonetheless, this is a text that must be included in every Russian language student's reference library!"
2,Not like the picture,This looks neat in the pucture but the real life story is that you have to be going really fast AT NIGHT to see any of the cool patterns. It just barely fit on my kids bike and I don't know about you but I don't let my kid ride at night.I'd have done better to line my kids spokes with string lights and that's probably what I will do.
4,This soap is very mild and doesn't dry ...,"This soap is very mild and doesn't dry skin at all like other regular soaps. It's definitely a very good deodorant and I also liked its mild fragrance. My husband loved it too. We're trying other Tom's of Maine soaps now. Oh, yes! I'd definitely recommend it to my friends and family."
4,Tom's Natural Deodorant Soap does exactly what it ...,"Tom's Natural Deodorant Soap does exactly what it claims to do. It has a very creamy consistency, lathers nicely, doesn't dry out your skin, and works well as a deodorant. It was labeled unscented, and indeed it was. Although I usually like unscented products, I found I missed the perfume when I bathed and I would like to try the scented variety of this soap."
3,Like a soap opera for your mind,"Harold Robbins books are perfect television. They're distracting and you develop a morbid fascination for the lives he unfolds before you. Never Love a Stranger is no different. My first Robbins novel, I was surprised by how involved I got in Frankie Kane's life... Robbins is very careful to make sure that his characters are not perfect angels. You can't love any one of them completely, but you also can't find them altogether evil or contemptible. Although Frank Kane is a dirty double-crossing guy, you can't help but root for him and cheer when he succeeds. The author doesn't have much talent for describing surroundings etc, but his character development is truly gifted. If you like Robbins, this is a must-read."
4,The first of Robbins' novels and one of the best.,"Lengthy, involving saga of racketeer Francis Kane was written in 1947 and is consequently less explicit than his later works. A classic drama which contains all the ingredients of a mass market winner - romance, suspense and tragedy. It was competently filmed in 1958 and starred John Drew Barrymore."
4,MUCH better than what's on the radio today,The only reason why this guy's not making millions like Jay Z or Yonug Jeezy is because he's actually good! This is a true westcoast cat who's got it all. This is an excellent solo debut and his albums will get only better and beter.
2,Functional but not perfect!,"Although these batteries do function once you get them in the camera, they are just enough larger than the original batteries to stick when you attempt to remove them. I had to actually remove the outer covering to make it possible to remove them without prying them.I would recommend staying away from these batteries unless your camera appears to have extra space with your existing battery."
5,This is a great movie out of 1 millon !,This movie catches your insterent'ds when it first start's I've seen tons of walt disney movies but this is a great movie not the best but it is one of my favrotie's !
1,Hideous,"I don't know where that other guy on here was coming from, saying that this is an action movie that keeps you at the edge of your seats (Disney can't make action, the little kids would get scared). This movie goes way over the edge of reality, giving a little stupid kid one-million dollars (now who thinks that will ever happen just on accident?). It's another Disney thing where they go through and put a kid in an outlandish situation and make an unoriginal slapstick humor movie. In fact, when I told someone at the theater I work at that one new movie was directed by the guy who directed this one, he shuddered from remembering how horrible this movie really was."
1,"Please, do not rent this movie",Simply horrible. Do not rent this movie.It's about a kid who fills out a blank check. Some mobsters come after him. He spends the money. <you can kind of guess what happens next>
1,LAME LAME LAME!,I seen this movie along time ago. I thought it was pretty dumb that a man could be so stupid enough to just give give a kid one of his blank checks I mean no one would be that stupid enough to do that. and that kid was such a careless theif he just slipped that blank check in his printer of his computer and typed in a million dollars and cashes it from the bank and now he becomes rich and start living a real lavish life (temporarily) having his own house and all the stuff a kid could ever dream of. The 3 men in this movie were crooks but that kid just got away with alot and he didn't go to jail for that he should. That money didn't even belong to him and he didn't pay for what he did. Well it's just a movie that can never happen in real life. I give it a 0 stars but amazon won't let me.
1,I wish I could give this 0 stars.,"This is literally in the top 3 worst movies of all-time. Complete waste of time and life that I will never get back because of watching this crap. There's always some other movie, or show, or what have you that is a lot better than this."
4,This is a Cute Movie That The Whole Family Can Watch Together!.,This is a movie that I didn't think I was going to like because I thought it was going to be really boring and cheesy but I surprised myself by actually liking it and I personally feel that Blank Check is a great movie for the enire family to watch together and I highly recommend it! A very cute movie!
5,Family Camedy,"DVD came in great condition, and it also came before the expected delivery date. Amazon were great in tracking my package i knew were it was every minute of the day. And as i say in every review, I will Definatley be shopping with AMAZON again!!"
4,Good movie,I always liked this movie. when i saw amazon had it i had to rent it. I like movies from the 80's and 90's
5,Blank Check,I bought this for a friend who lives in an Assisted Living Facility. It was packaged perfectly and arrived in perfect condition. She loves the movie.
4,cover that lens,My dog chewed up my original lens cap. This is an exack replacement except it doesn' say ultrasonic on it.It does a good job of protecting the lens.
5,Funny and engrossing,"This book is a wonderful combination of humor and suspence. Once you start it, it is very diffecult to stop. A great read for anyone who enjoys comedy and action , mixed into a fasinating tale about a wise cracking skull."
4,The Skull of Truth,This is a very good book. If you like sciece-fiction and fantisy you sould read this book.
3,The Skull of Truth,"Though the idea of this book is intresting it didnt appeal to me, because the humor is corny and at times quirky. The plot of the story is cool but the writing style and characters could have been better. For instance the main character was a dork with a weird personality. However I did like the setting of the book. It was an average everyday town thrown into an extorordinary situation. Charlie, the main character develops a lot during the story. He goes from a liar to a truthful kid, which is good. The lesson learned in this book is kind of weird. It is ''Honesty is the best policy--sometimes."""
5,Adds color and grit to naval history,"This book is a wonderful supplement to more comprehensive, but usually drier, naval histories. The author has been to sea and knows his subject, and it shows. 18 battles are described. In each case, Edwards discusses the historical context in which the battle took place, then vividly describes the battle and its aftermath. In each case, I thoroughly enjoyed reading the account; it almost felt like I was there.I noticed that twice Edwards referred to destroyers acting like ""slavering"" hyenas or hounds in engagements. Does he have something against tin cans?An outstanding book."
2,A Missed Opportunity,"Salvo! is a book that describes a number of surface (gunnery/torpedo) naval battles from the late 1800s through World War 2. Several of those battles, especially the Yalu River between the Chinese and Japanese, are all but unknown. This book's strength lies in descibing such engagements.But what should have been a highly valuable history is marred by a startling number of factual errors and by the author's bitter hostility to the US Navy. The author takes as many shots at the USN as his subjects do at each other. As often as not, they are nothing more than opinion, or based on inaccurate information, or subjective in ignoring similar events in other navies.If you find this book on the bargain table, consider it. Approach it with caution and don't use it as a reference. Do not under any circumstance pay full price for it."
5,Best Mechanix gloves made yet,"I work as a bag handler at the airport, and I go through gloves pretty fast. As a woman, it's always a challenge to find women's gloves made for hard work.I used to buy the black Mechanix gloves with the velcro, thinking they were the best. I bought them by the dozen because the fingertips would be worn through anywhere between a couple days and a week and half. The velcro would be shot in about 10 days. It sucked and it was expensive.Then I tried these. I bought three pairs eight months ago. I still have all three pairs. Not a single one blew a fingertip. And because these have no velcro, they didn't become uncomfortable or start falling off your hands.In addition, they are machine washable (at least mine were) and held up to working in the rain. These are so far superior to the velcro-wrist ones that I'm really surprised that anyone buys those. Well worth the money!! Comfortable, sturdy protection that holds up to heavy wear and frequent cleaning."
2,NOT AS PICTURED,"The picture is of the old style of the same number. Be aware these are now garden-type gloves. The back is now a plain knit, not the spandex shown. Mechanix says they will not be using this style anymore. The gloves still have leather-like palms, are machine washable and the back is the burgandy color shown. My wife really liked the old style better."
3,"They fit well, that's about the only good thing about them.","I was looking for gloves to do some rough and dirty work with. All in all? These gloves aren't it.These gloves are for you if:You're some dainty woman who does little else then occasionally pull a weed ... a thin weed.You like the pink/maroon color.You (for some reason) want gloves that are super thin and capable of little else than looking good, in a yard, not on the street or in public.These gloves are not good for:.... anything.Too thin, too fragileThere are a couple positives for these gloves:They are well made, and fit really well.No, I wouldn't recommend them."
5,Mechaniz Wear Women's Utility Glove,This is a great product. Easy on and off; fits well and permits movement of fingers while in the glove.
5,Mechanix Wear Womens Utility Glove,These are great work gloves for just about everything. Have purchased the leather ones before I would rather have those as I am sure for the gardening I do they last longer than these will. They are comfortable and I like them.
5,Easy to use and accurate,"I used this product for approximately 3 months without any problems and at the end of my third cycle, I am happy to say we are now expecting! For me, this was an excellent alternative to charting my temp and other info. While I did read some helpful books and paid attention to my cervical fluid, I found that this product was definitely the best way for me to not stress over when I was fertile. It allowed my husband and I to keep the 'trying' fun and not obsess over it. Although I suppose that has a lot to do with how you approach the whole process. The only thing I wish this product had was a computer connection so you could print out your month to month cycle info for comparison. Good luck to those of you who try this product and are trying, I hope this helps!"
4,Clearblue easy fertility monitor,"I have been using the monitor for 2 cycles now. So far, it has been helpful in determining my 'high' and 'peak' fertile days, so there is less guessing involved and I have some peace of mind that I am timing inseminations appropriately. The only drawback is that I have longer cycles, and do not tend to ovulate until at least day 20, so I have been using 20 test sticks per cycle, which gets expensive because each box is over $30 and contains 30 sticks. I have only given it a 4 and not a 5 for the rating because of the cost. It has been easy to use, but read all the directions carefully."
1,Do Not Buy the Clearblue Ovulation/Fertility Monitor,"I wish I could give it ""0"" stars. The reason you should not buy it is because it tells YOU when to test and does not give you an option if you feel you need to test on a different set of days. In other words, unless your cycle is very regular month to month, you are restricted when you test for ovulation based on when the monitor thinks you should test. I have missed several ovluations indicators because on the dates I should have been testing, the monitor did not allow me to test."
5,!!!!!!BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!,I have sat here and read all these reviews and cant believe that it didnt work for some. I bought this product to pinpoint my ovulation date for better chances of concieving a boy BUT i used common sense and also took my BBT aswell every morning and checked my CM....I CHARTED! This product was ACCURATE!! Everything was right on the money sort of speak! I recommend this product to everyone!If you use it correctly you should have no problems! I always made sure the the urine soaked entirely on the test stick....again common sense!
4,"Easy to use once understood,,","I didn't realize at first that you don't set the time window with any clock inside the machine yourself. It does this itself when you set it for the first time. So make sure to set it at the most convenient time as possible for you. If you set it to start on the first day at 9am, you have from 6am to 12pm to test. It asks for your first sample on day 6 so make sure and buy the test sticks too. Its that simple. Anytime before that window or after it, and the machine will not ask for a sample.My ovulation is irregular and comes late so I start my first day about five days after the last day of my period. It will all work out the same."
1,Review about the site and not the product,"Yes! This is an amazing product, however my complaint is about the store and not the product. I had ordered this for my next cycle and was told that I would have it in time. This item ended up not being in my hands for two entire weeks, which means I missed my cycle altogther.When you call for information they are not very helpful. This ended up being my first cycle using it. and I did conceive, however I did miss that cycle and the lack of assistance and answers was very stressful."
1,wast of time and money,"I bought the sticks, and I found out that I have to bought the monitor which is more than 100$ to use the stick. Then I found out that I have to wait for my period cycle. But my cycle is very irregular (that why I need these test), and I haven't seen my period for 2 months, so I have to keep waiting in order to used this products. I can't wait any longer, I just came to CVS and bought a one step pregnancy test. This product is such a waste of time and money, and bring you more stress!"
2,Don't Make your Decision based on the sticks being included.,"The test sticks are not included with this product. If you email customer support they will not send you the test sticks seperately, they will just send you several generic emails basically saying... if you don't like it send it back. So if you can find another deal (which I did see better) out on the web for a monitor alone for less you should consider it. The monitor has had great results for friends and family. I look forward to seeing the results. Unfortunately I went out and purchased sticks and began using it before I found out Amazon would not send me the test sticks that were missing."
2,Not my time!!,I used this monitor for 1 1/2 years and nothing! it was great to track my ovulation but wasted alot of my money and sanity. 1 /1/2 years later 2009 :) Surprise Your pregnant Baby Girl born 2010!!! then 1 1/2 years later i used the ovulation tracker app. on my phone and boom 2 weeks later found out i was pregnant with again with another little girl :) Dont stress!!
2,didn't work for me...,"I used this monitor for one month and it never gave me a high fertility day or a peak day. I therefore thought I was not even ovulating. However, it turns out that I did ovulate because I got pregnant that month. I did not suspect it due to the fact that the monitor never showed me as ovulating. However, I've had an ultrasound and hear a heartbeat so I'm definitely pregnant even though the monitor never said I ovulated. The only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1 is that I've heard that it can take time for the monitor to get to know your body. So maybe if I had needed it the next month, it would have been more accurate."
5,Worth Every Cent!,"Worth every cent! I got pregnant the very first month that I used this! Yes, you need to read the instructions and no it isn't as simple as peeing on a stick, but it is accurate and if you want that planned pregnancy that doesn't take you through next summer's heat then this is the purchase for you!"
5,Get ready--it works!,I used this monitor on a friend's recommendation and got pregnant twice within the first month of use each time. It's amazing!
5,Great Product!! Worked for me after 2 months!!,"Me and my Husband have been trying for 2 1/2 years to get pregnant. After one failed IUI cycle, we figured we would buy the monitor and save us money and stress. Well, I was shocked to see that it worked after only 2 uses. I thought it was very accurate in pinpointing your fertile days. I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend it to everyone."
4,It's okay,"I am on clomid so that tends to mess with my reading on the monitor. The first month, it didn't detect a ""peak"" day. However, I was temping and checking other things so I didn't miss my fertile days. I am about to use it for the 2nd month and hopefully it will detect it this time. I know a lot of people that use it and it worked for them. I will say, if you use it, don't make it the ONLY thing you rely on. Babydust to everyone!!!!"
5,Positive! Positive! Positive!,This product is wonderful. We tried for 5 months prior to purchasing this monitor. Got pregnant with first cycle of using it. The monitor is very easy to use. I highly recommend it to anyone who has been trying.
5,Worth trying out!,"My husband and I had been trying to have a baby for about a year when I found this online. My cycles were about 5-6 weeks long so I was interested in identifying my peak fertility days. After about 5 months using this monitor I'm pleased to say we are expecting! I read all the reviews before I bought it and didn't want to get too hopeful or excited, but now I truly am thankful I tried this monitor out. My only advise is be patient- things happen when they are supposed to, but sometimes we get anxious. Good luck!"
3,No sticks included!,I just got the delivery today expecting to use it right away. What they don't tell you is that the monitor is the only thing you get in the box. Sticks to make it work are sold separately. C'mon guys you can throw in a couple sticks to get started! For what this thing cost I don't think that's an unreasonable expectation. Pretty disappointed. Now I have to wait for the order of the sticks...hopefully we don't miss a chance to get pregnant this month.
1,Never found LH surge,"I've been using this particular monitor with the OV watch, because typical drugstore OPks never worked for me. I guess my pee is either always too diluted or my LH surge isnt strong enough to show up on an OPK. well I had the same trouble when using this monitor, it did not show me when I ovulated. the OV watch on the otherhand has been amazing, and has accuratly determined ovulation and the five days prior. My suggestion is that if OPKs dont work for you to use the OV watch instead."
2,"Warning, Does NOT come with test sticks!","I had recently ordered this product and had it rushed to me due to the time sensitive nature of using it correctly. I must say that this is indeed the best price at $135 since most drug stores charge around $180! However, unless I missed something glaring, I was disappointed to find that after my expedited 2-day shipping the product arrived without sticks! I believe that this should be very clearly noted and all I saw was small white print on the box after I opened it. It would have helped to know that the machine is literally useless without the sticks or to have at least a ""starter kit"" of them for this price! I am hoping that it does work for me and while I cannot yet rate the product itself I wanted to help others avoid making the same error I did. When you get to the point of ordering this kind of product, nobody wants to ""waste"" a month."
2,Don't just rely on this please!,"I have been using this for four months and still not pregnant. I have very regular preriod 30 days cycle. We are trying for baby number #2. I will suggest you, which I just realize now to use something else in addition to this product. The the 2nd peak day like other reviewers say it is by default the day after the first peak day and there is no way of looking back at previous cycles. I am questioning this monitor because I conceived my daughter just taking tempertures in the morning and no fancy equipments. This time, I wanted to save time but I've found myself maybe wasting time and money on this product and the expensive sticks. I will still use it going forward but with other test sticks. I am not saying anything bad about this product, just please use it with something esle to ttc. It will be better. I have relied soley on this so far (which I regret) and I am starting this month with other test sticks."
5,One cycle and PREGNANT!,"I never post reviews, but told myself I would if this worked in the first 3 months.I decided to try this after four months on Clomid. I wanted to take control of my fertility and with all the reviews, decided to try the CBFM. We used it for one cycle, I got highs from day 11-20 and even thought of giving up, then day 21, I finally got that longed for peak. It matched up with my +opk. Twelve days later, I got a very positive pregnancy test!!! I am so glad I decided to go for it and spend the money, it's the best thing I've ever bought!"
5,A must have if you want a baby,I bought this to help me conceive more quickly. The first month I used it I got pregnant. After having that baby I used it a couple of times more to try to get pregnant and both times I fell pregnant the first month using it but miscarried. This is a lot cheaper than going to the fertility doctor and works great. There is no need to be guessing or waiting for smiley faces this monitor is great and easy to use. I spent over 6k at a fertility specialist trying to get pregnant and didn't and I spend $150 on this monitor and got pregnant on the first try.
4,Excited about initial findings,"My husband & I have been trying to conceive for years. Even visiting fertility doctors and going through insemination. We were told that we had ""unexplained infertility"". Nothing could be found wrong with either of us. Needless to say, we finally broke down and purchased the monitor in January. I began testing day 6 of my cycle and became nervous when day 14 came around & I had not peaked. To our surprised I peaked day 17 & 18 (not around day 14) of my cycle. My BBT has remained high for 9 days now (99-100). We won't know if we are pregnant yet but atleast we have a better tracking method. I would highly recommend it!"
2,Not A Sure Thing,"My husband and i used this when we were ready to start trying for kids. The first month worked great, got a peak after a few high days. The next 2 months i only registered high daily, no peaks. I was scared this meant i was not ovulating at all but i got pregnant month 3. Not because of the monitor, because i was on high the entire month. It just happened the old fashioned way. Being on high all month i also spent a nice penny on a ton of sticks for 2 months. Upon research I found many other women with this issue and felt the need to write a review to help any other women that were in my boat so they didnt get scared about not ovulating. While im sure the monitor works for some, for me it was a waste of money."
4,it's accurate and easy,"We conceived the first month using the monitor where I had a strange cycle and ovulated on day 9, I never would have known about this ovulation. Unfortunately I had a very early miscarriage. Later I checked it for two months with BBT and found it to be accurate. Once we started trying again we happily conceived again within a few months. It takes stress out of the timing and is easy to use. I'm 38, and I was very nervous about the clock, the monitor gave me a sense of having more control over the thing ....."
2,Not pregnant yet....,I am on my 5th month of using this device with nothing to show for it! I read the manual and I am following the instructions very carefully. This month I decided that instead of following the readings as law I am going to use them as a guideline. Lets hope it brings better success! Seems like a lot of money to invest in a product for these types of results....
5,Fantastic Device!,"I have been diagnosed with PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) so I do not ovulate regularly. My husband and I had been to the specialists and went through numerous treatments when I decided I'd had enough time with the doctor. I'd heard about this device and was initially put off by the cost, but after spending THOUSANDS with my Dr, this was small potatoes - I bought it. I began using this in September/October and this confirmed what I already knew: I do NOT ovulate every month, and that I ovulate on cycle day 18-20 if/when I DO ovulate.We had decided to make the leap to IVF and decided to try this device one final time. Well, that's all it took - just a little patience because in February, I FINALLY became pregnant. It took 5 months of use for us due to my irregular cycles, but if you are trying to conceive on a specific timetable, I highly suggest purchasing this to take the guesswork out of when to do the deed.Count me in as one of the highly satisfied customers! :)"
3,Poor Experience,I ordered this item from amazon after a lot of research. For one the monitor arrived 10 days later even with faster shipping ordered on it. Another thing was that it says it comes with 20 test sticks and it came with NONE.I called customer service and they told me to return it. They didn't offer me test sticks. They didn't appologize for having a decieving advertisement. They didn't appologize for the fact I got this 10 days after I ordered it with fast shipping.Beware.
3,"Not ""unmistakeable"" as stated","Yes, the monitor works, but the description says that it is ""unmistakeable"". Not true. There was an instance (during a fertile time) when the monitor ""read"" the stick and gave a result of ""high"" even though the liquid had not yet passed through the test area that was ""read"" by the machine. It could have been a peak day, but I would not have known that had I not also been taking my temperature and using OPKs in addition to the monitor use.If you choose to buy this product, be sure the watch your fluids pass beyond the test area before placing the stick in the machine."
2,Order sticks seperately!,"I haven't used this yet but was very frustrated to find that the test sticks were not included. One section says they are included, another says they are not. This needs to be corrected! Thankfully, I have 1 day to buy them before I need to begin testing. However, I was very frustrated."
1,not working and confusing,"I was really dispointed at this machine. First urine in the morning does not work for me. And the way the machine is programed is very restrictive. It does not allow any mistake. I was using it for 6-7 months and the machine just kept giving me misleading readings. So I gave up. Guess what? The very first month after I throw this thing away, I was pregenant with my boy!"
2,NO COMMENTS really!!,"We bought this, used it, hated it, was too complicated, might have worked for other people but it surely didn't work for us. Total waste of time and money. I would not recommend it to anyone!"
1,broken on day 17,"I followed the instructions religious but the unit broke on Day 17, with signs to say so and ClearBlue confirmed it. They are sending a replacement, but all the data will be lost (Now i am wondering whether the data was even accurate because on Day 17, there is no change of whatsoever). Before the final 'replacement' sign, i got other signs too, clean up when it is brand new, etc. etc. So i do not know whether I just got a bad unit or their products are always like this. They should understand that time is very critical in this business.very frustrating indeed!!!!"
4,This does work but be patient,"This really is a great product but you have to be patient. I have a 1 and 1/2 year old and had a miscarriage in january. I was eager to start trying right away so I bought the monitor after reading all of the reviews and thought ""YES! Im going to be one of those people that gets pregnant the first month"" I wasnt and was extremely disappointed but I kept using the monitor because it really does what it is suppose to and also takes all the guessing out of the game for you, which is a huge relief, because trying to have a baby is stressful enough.I used the monitor 2 more times and on my third cycle got pregnant!Im hoping this one sticks and I will definetly be using this again. So for anyone that wants to relieve some stress and know they are doing all they can purchase this product but be patient!!"
5,positive,"We used The Clearblue Easy Digital Ovulation Tests for 10 months and were unable to conceive. I felt sad, frustrated, and disappointed and decided to go ahead and purchase the fertility monitor. It is expensive, but it's worth every penny. I started using the monitor in March and found out I was pregnant in June! Throughout, it helped me to feel more at ease and that I was doing something proactive to help us achieve our desire. I'm grateful for this product and plan on using it again in the future. We're expecting our baby March 2009."
4,A good tool to have when trying to conceive,"I just found out I am pregnant after 10 cycles of trying! I started using the clear blue easy monitor after 5 cycles therefore have been using it for 5 cycles. I was a little disappointed that I didn't get pregnant after the first time using it like so many others but I still highly recommend it. I have irregular cycles but always ovulate. Trust me, there were several cycles that threw me for a curve, ones where I ovulated way earlier than previous times and others, way later. I charted my temps and was very in tune with my body but was totally off on some cycles. I would have missed my ovulation had I not had this monitor. You may not get pregnant right away like some people, but trust me, stick with it. The monitor is really good to have b/c you can try all you want, but if you are not baby dancing during the ""fertile window"", it is pointless. Good luck to all who are trying, I know how hard it can be!"
5,This is the best investment I've made in my life,"This is the best investment I've made in my life. After four month of trying, my husband got me the monitor. First month, the monitor did not show that I was ovulating. It shows from day 7 to 22 that I am in high fertility level. Second month, the monitor showed that I am ovulating. We took all necessary actions and I am 14 weeks pregnant. I would recommend this monitor, because it showed that I ovulate very early (day 9-10), that's why we were missing it for five months."
2,Very misleading,"This retailer states that this product comes with 20 test sticks. I got this paockage and needed to use it the next morning. I open the box the night I got and came to find there were NO TEST STICKS with it. I lost an entire cycle of using this. I thought I was getting a great deal, and I didn't. The sales rep had no comments, and did not even know what I was talking about.Awful experience."
2,Not so good,Would not recommend it to women who do not have predictable cycles. it confuses the monitor and in turn us.
3,Preggers...but with little help from the monitor,"I just got my BFP and we are so excited! But, I decided to write this review because of our experience with the monitor.The first month we had LOTS of highs, no peaks. The second month we had three highs and two peak days, we BD every other day on the highs and both Peak days, but no baby. The third month we had 13 high days...a peak day on day 26! It turns out that ""peak day"" meant I was pregnant (LH and HCG are almost identical hormones).4 days after that ""peak day"" we have two BFP's, one standard test, one digital! We BD'd every other day on the high days and used pre-seed (first time using it...I would recommend)but the monitor failed to tell us when I was ovulating."
1,Don't Bother Using This Monitor,"I purchased this monitor brand new from Amazon.com. I followed the directions to the letter. The instructions say that for the first cycle using the monitor, it will ask for the first test stick on Cycle day 6. I turned on the unit well within my testing window, but only the 6 and one bar showed up for low fertility. The monitor did not ask for a test stick on day 6 like it was supposed to. It says it might choose another first test day in subsequent cycles, but this was my first cycle using the monitor. It was as if someone had it before. It came packaged perfectly, unless when people send their defective monitors back to the company, they repackage everything to look brand new. I bought 2 packs of sticks to go along with it, so now I have over $200 worth of paperweights."
4,Don't get TOO excited!,"11 months ago my husband and I decided to start TTC #2. I got pregnant with #1 immediately so never anticipated a long wait. After about three months with no success, I started to research my options and found out about the Clearblue Easy Fertility Monitor. Well of course after reading all of the reviews...I just had to buy it, everyone was having success and most within the very first month!! Well...we have been using the monitor for seven months and still have not gotten pregnant. We are doing EVERYTHING right...bd(ing) on the high and peak days, charting my BBT, watching for EWCM, etc. But it just has not happened. I definitely do not have anything bad to say about the monitor...it does what it is suppose to do. I just want to be realistic...not everybody gets pregnant right away. So when you purchase this, don't get overly excited that you are going to get pregnant within one to two months.....or you will be disappointed just like me."
5,kristinaveon,"WOW! It took 20 months, lots of infertility tests, and a HSG (which were all normal)to conceive our son 3 years ago. We had tried for 10 months on our own this time before I invested in this monitor. I would frequently read the reviews from couples that conceived in the first month as hope and encouragement that it could happen for us... Well, after two months of using the monitor we are 7 weeks pregnant!!!! The cost of the monitor and sticks was minor in comparison to all the infertility tests we paid for while trying to get pregnant the first time! We highly recommend this product and Amazon's price on the sticks with free shipping in the best deal out there. Good luck to everyone reading this!"
3,Monitor LIES,"I have used this monitor for 9 months total (one miscarriage in btwn) and this mnth it gave me HF earlier than expected so a few days later I used water on the test stick to see if its automatically telling me HF until I get an LH surge and sure enough the results were HF with WATER. So while I do believe it will recognize an LH surge, once it switches over to HF it will automatically stay there even if its not detecting any estrogen in your urine. Disappointing"
3,Old Info.,"I have not yet bought this product, but after doing some research I understand where the false information concerning the 20 test strips came from. This product used to be packaged with 20 free test sticks. If anyone is selling this monitor with 20 test strips, the product is well over a year old, and the test sticks are either close to or past their expiration date.Hope this helps clear up the confusion. It is possible to purchase this kit with 30 test strips included from other online retailers, but you would have check to see if that saves you any money...it may be cheaper to just buy the test and strips separately here."
5,Worked the first time!!!,"This monitor is fabulous! I used it once- for a month- and got pregnant. Two of my friends had the same results, just one cycle and boom, pregnant. If you have been trying w/o luck, definitely worth the money! I plan to use it again when our baby is a little older for baby #2. GOOD LUCK!"
3,pricey,"i do not have anything negative to say about this product. it is accurate and reliable. i like that it counts the days of the cycle for you. however, there are other cheaper products that are just as accurate and reliable."
3,May not be worth it.,"I used this monitor first thing in the morning as directed and the Clearblue Digital Ovulation tests in the afternoon. The Ovulation tests caught my LH surge the afternoon BEFORE this monitor caught it the next morning. That makes me think that it may be just as helpful to use the Ovulation tests in the afternoon and spend less money for the same information. If you really have no idea when you ovulate, then this monitor may help you keep track of things over time, but I really would suggest saving the money and using as many of the cheaper Clearblue Ovulation tests as you want."
4,Another Step Closer>>>>:),"Me and my Hubby has been trying to Conceive for a Few Year's, I'm 37 and not getting any younger, so we Decided that we might just not be hitting my ovulation day's like I believed I was. Well after buying the monitor I did find out I was calculating completely wrong. The monitor is very easy to use. And within a few minute's, it will tell you if your not ovulating, or you hit the high peek to conceive..Just as simple as that...Takes the Guessing in a whole better direction. I would highly recommend this monitor, and you only use about 10 strips thru the month. Hopefully my next review will be that it worked!!!!"
5,All doubts erased!,"I purchased this monitor in March 2012. The first month I used it, I was a little frustrated because I never got a ""peak"" reading. By the second month, however, the monitor got to know me better and I got my peak on day 18... much later than I thought I was ovulating. Needless to say, I am pregnant after 2 cycles using this monitor!!! I was SUPER skeptical, but purchased it after tons of research and thinking I might as well give it a try. I was unsuccessful at pinpointing my actual ovulation day for months, because I didn't always have symptoms or tell-tale signs. I was even starting to think I wasn't ovulating at all before I decided to use this machine. Overall, I highly recommend this monitor to those women who are having trouble getting pregnant the old fashioned way. If you're on the fence on buying it, I'd say it was well worth taking the guessing game out of baby making!"
2,Sticks are defective,"I have had this monitor for a long time, over a year. At first I loved it, but the last three boxes of test sticks I have received (from different sources) have been defective! I wish I could attach a photo to show an example of what I am seeing on the sticks before they are read by the monitor. I do not trust these results when the strips have weird smears and uneven coloring. Clear Blue needs to start investing in some quality control or this monitor is useless."
3,Still waiting,Nothing has happened yet still trying. Maybe something will happen at least I can track it now.Still being hopeful.
1,Did not work for me...Showed no more than two bars all month yet I'm pregnant.,"I ordered this under the advice of my doctor. She told me it didn't look like I was ovulating regularly and that this test would help determine if/when I did. So I ordered it and peed on sticks everdy for 20+ days, and I NEVER got more than two bars (moderate fertility) the entire month! I never got a peak with a little egg so I just assumed I wasn't ovulating like the tests at the doctor's office said. Well....I just took a pregnancy test on day 36 and got a BFP (big fat positive). I'm upset that I spent a freaking fortune on a machine that never detected my fertility even though I obviously at some point was very fertile. I'm thrilled to be pregnant, but not at all happy that this machine didn't work the way it was supposed to as expensive as it is - and yes, I did pee at the same time every single day."
3,"From the ""Mists of Avalon"" genre","What a pity that so many of Diana Paxson's novels are out of print! While perhaps not up to the very high level of Marion Zimmer Bradley's or Rosemary Sutcliff's portraits of Celtic Britain, Paxson undeniably draws a rich and detailed picture of life in Britain just after the invasion of the Celts from across the English Channel. Her scenes frequently have the feel of Homer's archaic world of the Iliad. There is a bit too much fantasy marring the historical impact--visions and shapeshifting and such--but Paxson draws a compelling picture of a lost world. I recommend reading Shakespeare's King Lear before reading this novel--it brings it to even more colorful life."
2,If you have really small hands,"this is the brush for you. The description says 3/4"" (I missed that) so I should have known. Then I was charged $6.00 plus for shipping which makes this a pretty expensive brush for someone with tiny hands. Then I didn't read the reviews either. So what have we learned here - read the reviews, then read the description carefully, a lastly - check the shipping charges."
2,Annotated Bibliography,"This was the required text for one of my classes, but the information is kind of out of date and only useful if you have immediate access to these titles. I don't expect to use it much."
5,Different but rewarding,"Thi film is slow and requires patience but it is beautifully and delicately directed, written and acted. A childish rather irritating woman selfishly abandons her kids to fend for themselves. The oldest is a 12 year old boy who then takes on responsibilities well beyond his years to help his siblings to survive and stay together. The actor portraying this boy gives a very nuanced performance. The film is in the style of almost like a documentary or reality show. It is not your normal Hollywood film and will be more appreciated by the discerning film watcher rather than someone wanting to watch something mainstream and escapist. The film also does not present any easy solutions to the problem nor does it try to."
2,Stopped working within 2 months,"This heated seat cushion worked perfectly for about a month or so. Then it just quit working. Didn't get around to trying to return it until now, only to find out it could only be returned within the first couple of months. You get what you pay for."
1,stopped working after 2 weeks,"This item gets very hot within a minute or two of turning it on. However, it stopped working after only 2 weeks of use, right in early January here in Wisconsin when I really needed it! Reading other reviews suggests a common theme in this regard."
1,Did not last,When I first received the seat warmer I was very excited. It heated up quickly and was so warm an toasty. It lasted about 3 weeks and then died. I guess you get what you pay for.
4,Use for mother in back seat of van when we travel,We purchased this product for my mother who is 79 yrs old. She wants to ride in the back seat behind the front passenger seat and that seat is nto heated. When the product arrived we found the cord was not long enough to reach the cigarette ligher to plug it in to give her a hot seat. We ended up going to Wal-Mart to pick up and edtension divice and now it works like a charm. She is warm and toasty like rest of us. A great choice for an elderly parent when they need to stay warm.
4,good item,"This is a very nice product. It will warm you up fast, while waiting for your cars heater to kick in, in the cold weather. Also, I am a cold natured person, who will sometimes use it in the warmer months as well, when my husband freezes me with the air-conditioning. Furthermore, the price is unbeatable..."
4,"Hot Seat, but Straps Leave Me Cold","As noted in previous reviews, the seat heats up as advertised and was cheap. It is warmer than the fancy hot seat in our Camry. The straps broke immediately, however. For the price, I can reposition the seat. I would have given this a 5 star except for that, and even knowing that, I just may buy another!Five stars for swift service, by the way."
1,Okay for the price,"My husband purchased this item for me in December 2008. It worked for about 3-4 months and then just stopped working. When it did work it worked well and got pretty warm, making my backside toasty warm and happy. However, the straps that held it to the underside of the seat broke quickly and the back would always fall down and bunch behind me whereby I had to adjust it every time I sat into the seat."
4,Pretty good,"Works better than a different one I bought at Target for $25, which just heats the butt and burned my wife's car seat fabric. The 2 temperature settings are nice. (usually I keep mine on low) The only complaint I have is the straps to hold the cushion onto the car seat. I had to use a small bungee cord to hold the straps in back, and I tied the 2 straps in the front to the bar that controls the seat's back and forth motion because they were too short. But it's staying in place nice. Highly reccomended to take the chill out of a winter's morning."
4,super,just warms up quickly and you can shut your heat off. But remember to unplug it cause it will drain your battery.
2,Very warm but guaranteed to break after 2 months of use,"2nd one of these purchased and just as expected broke after 2 months of use. When working it works great and keeps you comfortably warm. Warranty is a hassle, must send in a card. Ordered the next generation today and will send in the broken unit under warranty so passenger can have a butt warmer too. As I said, for $20 keeps you warmer than with just a heater but do not expect this to last more than two months."
4,Warms more than your heart,Great for most cars that don't come with heated seats. Only problem is that it must be unplugged every time you leave the car.
1,Junk,Worked for a little wjhile then stopped working. Not sure if I would buy another product like this. Still looking for a better product.
1,does not do much,This cuchion does not put out much heat.The straps are poorly made. It is back in the box and stored inthe attic.
2,Got me through almost one winter.,"It lasted a few months during the coldest part of the winter and worked admirably. Like others mentioned, the straps are cheap and don't do much to hold it in place. After a few months it just stopped working. Tried it in my other car (which has seat warmers) and it still didn't work. It seemed like such a simple device that I was annoyed that something still broke. When it did work though I was always scared of leaving it on and running my battery dead. Not really a fault of it so much but something to think about.When it worked, it was great. High actually would get too hot most of the time. For the price, I guess I should think of it as a disposable model, good for one winter only. If I were to buy a new one I would look to upgrade to a better model."
3,works for awhile,"this item seems to work good for a short duration.ive bought three in the past two months.first one lasted a week,second about two weeks,and the third one i give it a week or two.i keep buying them because theres a price for comfort,and they do work good before they short out.my suggestion is buy two of them."
2,Item not as advertisrd,Bought two of thses Wagan 9738 heated set cusions. All advertising including advertising on outside of package received indicates that it has a high low off tempeature control. IT DOESN'T HAVE THIS AT ALL! This item only works 12V. For office or home use you need an additional adapter.I would not buy this item again due to false advertising.
3,Shipped fast and heats up fast!,"For the price you can't beat it. Got the item in two days, seat cushions is great in cold weather. Heats up in about two minutes. Even if the cushion lasts only two seasons, it's worth it!"
3,it ok,it gets the job done. if you leave it on and plugged in it will drain your battery. not sure if you turn it off and leave it in. warms up quick enough. i only use it on the high setting since i have it sitting under a seat cover as well. I'd say worth the money if you can remember to unplug the thing.
2,"Poor design, falls apart","I have now owned three Wagan seat-heaters, and this was the first I bought. This one does have a hi/lo/off switch and is warm, but the material is very flimsy (rips easily, kind of a foam-like material) and the straps to hold this to the seat are worthless. Also, the cord separated from the seat with normal use. I got about five months of use from this. For comparison, I have also hadWagan IN2282 Black 12V Faux Leather Deluxe Heated Seat Cushionwhich is better design in terms of durability of material. That one lasted me the whole season, but was dead this fall after closet storage for the summer. I just boughtWagan IN9738-5 12V Heated Seat Cushion with Enhanced Durability and 3-Way Temperature Control Switchwhich seems to have durable material, much better straps, and has a 3-way switch."
4,"VERY GOOD PRODUCT, GETTING MY WIFE 1 :)","Very good item, takes only a few minutes to heat up (my car heater seems to need a few minutes more). I only purchased this for it's seat warming ability but found it to sooth my lower back pain that i sometimes get, so i think it's a bonus. I did not think it would work this well for the price, very impressive. I'm going to order 1 for my wife also. The heated seat cushion looks great but the straps look really cheap. So i don't use the straps (sit on it and it's not going anywhere) plus i move it from driver seat to passenger seat as my son likes to take it for him lol.As for people who say it kills your car battery i say to them GET A REAL CAR BATTERY! love the product i gave it 4 stars only because the straps look very, very cheap but, like i said i don't use them."
4,Great item....!,"Just received two of the seat warmers this afternoon and have already installed them. We have a, supposed, serious cold spell headed our way tomorrow and will be giving the both of them a really good workout, in the mornings especially. Also, thanks for the very timely delivery."
4,"So far, so good...","I bought this as a gift and my sister-in-law loves it so much that she left it plugged in overnight and had to jumpstart her car the next morning. Obviously,the gift went to a wonderful home."
5,great seat warmer...even better price,"This is a great seat warmer. We have seen temps in the single digits and even below zero recently in the morning here in New England. Long before the inside of the car is warmed up, my seat is nice and toasty. Easy to get in and out of the car even with a bulky winter coat on. Great price as well. My wife is now hinting that she ""needs"" one. Great product"
3,"it works, but will drain your battery","This is my own fault, but be warned, it's very easy to forget to unplug this thing and your battery is dead. I have had to get a jump start 3 times in 2 weeks due to leaving it plugged in overnight."
2,bad,"Wires broke in the winter cold, made the wires britel. it didn't even last on winter. it broke within a month"
1,Only lasted a month,"The heater worked great, but only for about 4 weeks during which time it was used daily for a 1 hour commute to work. Then it stopped heating. I called the manufacturer and they offered to replace it but only if I returned the original. I decided that the cost and aggravation of packing and shipping were not worth it. Hope my case was the exception not the rule."
4,Keeps up the heat,My wife has a lot of back problems and this thing really keeps the heat on while she's driving. Probably one of the best gifts I could have gotten for her.
3,"Worked great, died fast","Title says it all, it was a gift for my partner who loved it while it worked through the cold Vermont winter. It died in less than a year. My advice: spend just a bit more to get a more long-lasting product."
1,Stopped working after a couple uses.,"This heated seat cover stopped working after I very gently used just a few times. After it stops working they will tell you that they will only do a partial refund and that you must pay for shipping. This makes no financial sense, so its going straight into the garbage. Something tells me that, by the quality of it, this may be a fairly common experience."
1,Short-lived,"The first of 2 of seat heaters we purchased failed in less than 3 weeks. The second one has now failed at the start of the second winter. The first was replaced free of charge. I have not asked (yet) for the second to be replaced but it is nearly a year old. I rate them ""not reliable"". They are nice when they work.Wagan IN9738 Black 12V Heated Seat CushionI see there are ""enhanced durability"" units now available (no wonder) but I am skeptical."
3,for the price can't beat it,We ended up buying two of the heated seat cushions. Used to have heated seats in one car but after spending $300 to replace it and it broke again I decided this was the way to go. The only problem with the product is that it doesn't have any body. Every time you get into the car seat it gets all squished up. If it had a firm seat and back to keep it in place it would be better but for under $20.you can't beat it. The heat works wonderfully.
5,My husband loves this,I bought this for my husband for his truck. He said it works great (he has heated seats in his car and really missed it in the truck).
3,Disposable Seat Heater!,"This is my third purchase of the Wagan Heated Seat Cushion--not because I have three cars, but because each one only lasts one season. Yes, the heat very quickly. Yes, the elastics are kind of cheap, but that doesn't really matter. Yes, it's such a deal . . . all of which is why I don't mind buying a new one every winter, they should be labeled Disposable Seat Heaters! Also, buyers should note that the deluxe version does not have a high/low thermostat, but the regular one does . . all for 50 cents less! Go figure."
1,Faulty Product,"I've bought two of these items. One lasted two (2) months; the other lasted one (1) months. Moreover, the straps broke easy. Buyer Beware!"
2,It worked great at first,I bought the Heated Seat Cushion because my cars heater broke and I couldn't afford to get that fixed right away. I deliver newspapers in the early morning and here in Nevada we were still getting down to freezing or colder. This product worked great for almost 2 weeks and then one morning it just didn't work. My car heater is fixed now though...
2,"Heater works not sure for how long, quality lacking","After only using it for a couple of days the elastic straps started breaking so the seat its a little inconvenient to get in and out of the care. The heater works well for now which is what I bought it for so i can live with it.I have learned from experience with these heaters, that the coils are not very forgiving, if they bend the wrong way they break and bye-bye heat so I have to be especially careful now when I get in and out because it tends to get wrinkled up under and behind you.If I had to do it again I would buy a different brand."
1,A BIG disappointment TWICE!,"I bought TWO of these heated seats. Iowa winter is cold. After one day in use one had already died...no heat at all. Sent it back and immediately got a replacement (which was great Amazon service!). After about 2 weeks the replacement has now ALSO died! I will not buy again and won't recommend! Now I wonder when the other one will quit working too! If I could, I would grade these a NEGATIVE star rating!"
3,had to replace one,I bought 2 . One for the driver and the other for the passenger in the front. The driver side one failed but Amazon made it really easy to exchange it. It was all very easy. So far we are pleased with the product. It is actually warmer than some of the cars I've been in that came with heated seats. If the ones I have now keep on working I will be very happy with my purchase.update:Product did not last. It was fun while it lasted.
5,Great Item!,"I had been given a heated car seat many years ago, and it finally would no longer work. I looked on Amazon, and there was one very similar to what I had. However, when the seat arrived, it was much nicer. I especially like the hi/lo button. Another great purchase from Amazon!"
4,Great Product,"This is a great product but you do have to remember to shut it off when you get out of the car or you will drain your battery! We had just placed a new heavy duty battery in our truck because I had drained the battery down with my heating pad. I left it on over night. Thinking I had shut it off, I had actually put it on ""Hi"". This device does not have an automatic shutoff, so you need to make sure it is off before you get out of the car. It heats fantastic."
1,Stopped working after one month,"The title says it all. And, it's been just long enough that the return window has expired so stuck with a bad purchase. Don't buy this product."
1,Good heat but fragile wiring...won't last more than a week or so,"I was really surprised by this seat heater! Cheap and works well (for about a week...see UPDATE below).....on below zero days it takes a while to heat up but still it is so much better than my plain cloth seats in my Wrangler. My only caveat is that the wiring seems rather chabby. I already had to return one (Amazon is great for this...even pays for the shipping back) for the wiring coming loose. So pay your twenty bucks....and be careful not to tug on the cord. Oh, one more hint.....YOU MUST UNPLUG ONCE THE CAR STOPS....found this out the hard way so now I wind the cord around my leg so there is no chance I'll forget to unflug my butt warmer! UPDATE: Forget this item....my replacement lasted less time than the first one that broke. Next time I will spend more money on one that works for more than a few weeks."
1,One month and it stops working!,"I was excited to get this for my BF, so was he, but after a month of use it no longer works! What a waste of money :("
2,Heated Seat Cushion,"Awesome at first...heated up quickly and kept the ""Mrs"" happy while she drove her truck to and from work, then it burned out and I had to throw it away. I went from hero to zero in less than two weeks. Not recommended."
1,It quit working within 2 months!,I purchased the Wagan 12V Heated Seat Cushion and it quit working within the first two months. I probably used it 10 days!
1,a cold piece..!!,"could not wait for my item to arrive after I placed my order after reading reviews..!!mine does not even warm up after 20 min of plugging in...returning it now, maybe I was unlucky with a bad piece, taking the pain to add a review which I usually don't..."
4,Heated seat cushion,Product was as advertized. Have only used a few days but so far works well and was easy to install.Definitly adds comfort to cold Vermont days!!
2,Stopped working after first winter,"This seat cushion worked fine last winter. However, when I took it out of storage this year to reinstall it, it didn't work at all. I also agree with other reviewers that the fastening straps are cheap and don't do much of a job of holding it in place. I only paid about $20 for it, though, so it's cheaper than having heated seats factory-installed, even if you have to buy a new one every year."
4,heated set pads,great at keeping you warm for the price. The pads move around if you do not modify the straps. It is easy to do. You also have to unplug them or shut them off so they do not drain your battery. Great for the price. Kepps my butt warm .
3,Wagan heated seat review,"It heats up great, the straps that are used to hold it against the seat aren't strong enough. They separated from the seat cushion within the first week."
2,"Warms well, but doesn't stay well on leather seats","The product warmed up really well, but the straps did not hold snugly against leather seats, nor did the product itself.It will probably work better on cloth seats, since they don't slip as much.The product also tended to fold or ripple in the seat area, so my wife was constantly having to adjust it."
2,Price reflects quality,"As mentioned, the heat comes on fast and the thin pad easily conforms to the seat. But, it worked only intermittently after one month and stopped completely after 2 months. Also, the pad bunches up, so you must re-arrange after each use. However, it costs under $20. Even if I buy a new one each year, it's still cheaper than what the auto manufacturer's provide. : ) So, the price reflects the quality."
2,Heated seat cushion,"The price was right and the seat heated up. On the down side, the elastric straps slipped down and broke. The back of the seat wrinkled up and slid down to the bottom. I used this on leather seats, but perhaps it would have worked better on cloth seats."
4,Works as advertised,"After not too long I need to switch it from high to low, an option not available on some more expensive ones."
4,Works Great...so far.,"I've been using it daily for about a month now and it works great! I had to purchase some metal ""s"" hooks to replace the plastic ones it came with as they were cheap and broke easily."
1,WORTHLESS!!!,I bought this product for my wife for Christmas and it did not even last 3 weeks. I would like to know how to go about getting a replacement or refund. Thank you.
1,Plug Melted,Worked fine for about a month and then the plug melted in the power outlet. Useless now.
1,Doesn't work but can't get a refund,Shipped my SUV from Hawaii to upstate NY and so it did not have seat warmers. I purchased this and was able to use it after my truck arrived in March 2011. (about 30 days) It just started getting cold again and it work for 2 days then stopped working. For me that's the biggest issue. I can deal with the fact it doesnt stay put and slides around. Now I am informed I had to refund it within 30 days of purchase. Don't waste your money.
3,does not get too warm or even hot,This unit was great the first time I used it but now the seat warmer only gets a mild warm feeling.
3,Good product.,"I bought this product about a weak ago. The temperature is not too hot just perfect and you can also change it from low to high. The price is very affordable. However, the only think that I don't like about this Seat Cushion, it moves around every time when I sit down on it, which makes me feel uncomfortable."
2,Nice while it worked... BUT....,"This was great while it worked, got nice and toasty this past winter. With that being said, it stopped working after about a month. I guess this is another situation where you get what you paid for. I won't be buying another after seeing the comments of the units burning holes in seats, Yikes!"
1,Stopped Working After One Month,"The price is right and the seat is nice and warm, but the seat stopped working after two months. I had seen that another reviewer wrote the same thing, but I decided to take my chances. I lost. Amazon has a one month return policy."
5,Good item,"I read the slightly negative reviews of this item before I purchased it, but they didn't seem too bad so I went ahead. The high setting is very toasty, though the low setting doesn't really seem to do much. Considering how much the car manufacturers charge for the heated seat option, this is ideal. I did accidentally leave it plugged in and ""on"" one day. Someone else wrote that this would drain your battery in three hours. That didn't happen (mine was plugged in for more than 8 hours) - perhaps the battery was already weak. An ""auto-off"" would be a nice added feature, but other than that, it's great. I actually placed it underneath my seat cover to eliminate the ""bunching"". No problems."
1,Dangerous - caught fire in my car,"The seat cushion is dangerous, as it malfunctioned after only two weeks of intermittend use and correct installaton. It burned my wife's back, my fingers and burned a hole in my car seat."
1,Low Quality - Stopped Working after 8 weeks...,"Y'know, I wonder if products like this ever get field tested!? The crappy straps broke almost instantly and I was prepared to accept that rather than deal with going through the hassle of returning it. Now one of my units stopped working completely.Even if the company comes through with an equitable returns policy, I'm leaving this feedback as is because it's a fair reflection of the quality of it."
4,"Heater works great, fasteners break easily.","This thing puts out some awesome heat, and it heats up very quickly, only takes a minute or so. However, within 2 weeks, the main elastic band that holds the back on to the seat broke. Not really a huge deal, as most if not all of the heat is concentrated under your...eh, bottom."
2,When it works -- awesome....,"I have purchased 4 of these in 3 years...I live in the Pacific NW -- cold, damp in winter...This seat warmer is GREAT when it works....Each of mine have died within 3 months. I called the company on the last 2 and they did replace them, but one of the replacements has already died (2 mos). I do a 6 mile commute daily....I'm the only one that owns the car....basic use. The company warns to unplug seatpad before starting the car -- burst of electricity can blow the fuse -- but still, they seem to die. That said, they are cheap to buy and if they get me thru each winter with warm buns and not shivering to death in my 6-mile commute before the car heats up....it's worth it. Part of my winter expenses.... Good luck."
3,"OK, but has issues.","This thing work great. The only issue is that is does not stay in place, it doesn't hold it's shape, and if leave it on, it will run your battery down. I've had to get a jump start a couple of times afte work. ;-("
2,"Great Heat, Poor Life","Pros - This product heats up fast all over and provides plenty of heat and has a small price tag.Cons - It does not have a high back and being 6 ft tall, it occasionally shifted down a little & the top edge was uncomfortable under my shouldblades. It only lasted 4 months. Having a weak back, I tend to squirm and the shoulderblade issue made me shift more. I'm also 115 lbs which adds more force on the wires. Being an engineer, I found the broken wire and repaired it only to have it fail 2 weeks later. I thought the wire size was extremely small (have never seen any other brands though) which would tend to fatique faster with movment.If you're smaller & don't squirm, this could last a while for you. I need one that's more heavy duty."
2,Not Built to Last!,"Worked well for 5 months - then kaput! The indicator light still shows it is working, but no heat in the seat now. So sad. I really liked this thing. I will be looking for one of better quality that hopefully comes with a warranty."
4,Heats up fast,This cushion works well. The only complain I have is that the elastic strap that secures it to the seat broke after about a months use. Other than that it works just fine.
3,Heated Seat Cushion,I bought this as a gift. I never really got any good feedback from the person except that it was just OK
2,Lasted two months,"This product worked great for about two months, and then just quit working at all. The heated seats in my Yukon quit working, which is why I bought the Wagan. I figure even if I have to buy a few of these, it's still better than the $400 it would have cost to fix the factory seats. The reviews for the Dr. Scholl's heated seats don't have any comments about them breaking, so I'll try those next."
1,"Look elsewhere, this thing is garbage","I received this as a gift and it quit working within 30 days. I contacted the company for a replacement and although they agreed to a replacement under their 1 year warranty, I had to pay close to 50% of the cost of this thing to ship it back. I don't understand why I am made to pay to ship it back if they sold a defective product! At this point in time, it has been between 3 & 4 weeks since I sent it back and have not heard a word from the company on my replacement. I honestly have no faith the new one will work more than a month or two either.Stay away from this product and this company. The heater is garbage, the company doesn't fully stand behind the item as they make you pay to ship it back when it will break and their communication is non-existent. Look elsewhere and for something of better quality. I guess you get what you pay for with this product."
3,Unplug it as soon as you get to where you are going,This product works great.... but it will run your battery flat in 3 hours if you don't unplug it...It happen to me..I rather ride on a cold seat then to have a dead batttery after a hard days work
2,Need more amps,Didn't realize this is rated for only 3amps. Want to use with a heated seat cushion that needs 6 amps by itself plus an XM radio so had to get an adapter rated for 10 amps.Maxell Universal DC Car Adapter (AUTO DC-2)
1,never received product,"Ordered heated cushion online, Amazon charged my card, then about a week later, Midway(company who actually sells the product) emails to say they are canceling my order. They stated, ""Unfortunately, the item you wish to purchase, Wagan IN9738 12V Heated Seat Cushion, DNH-9738, is not available and we are unable to fulfill your order."" I don't understand why they would continue to sell it on Amazon.com when they do not have the item nor will they ever be able to get the item. Thanks for wasting my time! Never ordering from them again!"
4,Works Well,Very good add on to get seat heat. Have been using for about 6 weeks. Our vehicle doesn't have anything to tie down to using the ties at the front of the cushion so it has a tendency to slide around. Otherwise a perfect solution to our cold seat!
2,Short lasting heated car seat,I got this seat for my husband for Christmas and three weeks later it does not work. He even didn't use it every day and he is not heavy so weight should not have been a factor.
1,Quit working - twice!!!!,Last year I bought this product. It quit working after one month - January in Minnesota! Returned it promptly but by the time they sent me a new one it was April and I didn't need it. Put the new one in my car in December and here I am in January with a seat cushion that quit working. Would not recommend this to anyone!!
2,Wagan Heated seat cushion,"Don't waste your money. I received this item Jan 3, 09, it quit working Feb 13, 09. To late to return item, contacted company and no response. So its a waste of money, since it does not heat up any more."
4,Heated Seat Cushion,"The only item that would improve the quality is if the seat connection be able to come out of either side, not just the right side."
4,Wagan heated seat - a great item,"We purchased this seat for our daughter to use in the back seat. It did need an extension for the power cord, but that was easily found at Radio Shack. It heats up wonderfully, and fast, but we have already forgotten to shut it off twice! If this seat had an automatic shut off I would have given it 5 stars."
2,Really Warm and Happy and then Greatly Disappointed,"Worked perfect for a little over a year - even better than the heated seat that I had in my prior Subaru - within 30 seconds my seat and back are toasty warm -HOWEVER, it failed in just over a year (one year warranty period), even though it was carefully stored and handled (I have no children, etc).E-mailed Wagan customer service, who did not reply to the first e-mail. After their initial reply which was in respone to the fact that I would post on Amazon they responded andwould not replace and said that would send a part. When I asked them how I could replace this part myself, they never responded back to me, nor sent the part. Shame on this company. Very poor customer support."
3,Great while it worked !,It worked for more than 4 months perfectly. It was even better than the factory installed heated seats of my wife's car both in terms of warming time and intensity. But one day it stopped working. For a price of 17 cents a day it wasn't a terrible deal.
1,Heated Seat Cushion,"This thing only lasted about 5 hours, or about 2.5 trips to work. It really only had one heat setting, which was fine if it would have just worked. Also, the straps that hold it to your seat are cheap and would clearly break after a few more uses - again, fine IF IT WOULD HAVE JUST WORKED!"
4,Good value for the money,"My car sits at the train station all day while I go to work in Chicago and the leather seats are very cold when I return. The seat cushion is helpful in large part just by putting something between me and the leather seat. It never gets all that warm, but then I only have about a 15 minute drive to get home. I have accidentally left it plugged in overnight with no ill effects. Make sure that you have tied all of the ties to your car seat. I missed the tie at the back (below the two elastic loops) for quite a while. I have some concern that the seat will slide if I have an accident, undermining the value the seat belt. That third tie in the back seems to help keep the seat cushion in place."
2,"Nice for 4 months, then stopped working","It worked well for about 4 months, then the straps on the seat back portion ripped. Couple days later, it died. Now it is a doggy bed in the back seat of the truck. Luckily, it was much cheaper than most doggy beds!"
3,It works ....,"works well. Just remember to unplug it from your lighter socket or it will drain your car battery for sure. Slips alot around the seat, but it does keep you warm."
3,Stopped working in two weeks!,"Title says it all, basically. It was nice and cheap, but a nightmare to get to fit properly on the seat, without moving (straps are no good). Also, it stopped working within 2 weeks."
2,heat is good construction is bad,"i bought this for my wife as a gift. The heat was very good it get hot very fast in winter, but the construction of this product is terrible. The straps ripped off the cushion in less then a week. So it does not last very long at all."
1,Poor quality,I liked the idea of the heated seat. This particular one worked great for about 3 weeks. It really heated my rear and lower back on those very cold days. However in the last week or so I noticed everyday that the heat output was getting weaker and weaker and as of this writing is now inoperable.
3,"It will warm your backside, but is not quite the same as heated seats!","For $18 - I think I got my money's worth. It is just basically a heating pad for your cat seat and that was really all I expected.On really cold morning, it heats up fast and my bum is warm as toast driving to work. My husband is happy b/c I'm not always complaining to him that HE has heated seats in his car and I do not.It does not attach to your seat well and requires repositioning everytime you get in the car, though. Overall, it works well and keeps me warm. It was what I expected for $18."
1,Poor quality,"Didn't last a month in my car. To flimsy, sure was hoping for a better product. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
4,Wagan 9738 reivew,"Good product, warms nice and quick. the straps that are to hold the cushion in place are inadequate and one broke the first time I installed the product. I figured out a work around, however they should really figure out a better attachment for the straps."
2,works ok but has a limited lifespan,"I bought one of these in Dec-2009 via Amazon and I used it for 3 months in each of the past two winters, but this year it has completely stopped working. No heating at all. I suspect they can easily develop breaks in their small wiring and that results in shorting them out."
1,keep shopping,One of the straps that fits around my seat broke the first day. And I have small seats in my Prius (I wish my 2007 model year had a heated seat option for the leather). Gets bunched up easily and does not stay in place. Worst of all- stopped working for no apparent reason after only three weeks. No way to exchange or anything. I will have to buy another brand so I don't freeze my a** off.
4,heated seat cushion,"DONT HAVE THE CUSHION BUT READ ALL THE REVIEWS ABOUT IT AND SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD....""I JUST HAVE A COMMENT TO MAKE ABOUT THE FASTENERS FOR THE CUSHION BREAKING.."" HOW ABOUT IF YOU USE BUNGIE CORDS ..? ONES WITH THE WIRE HOOK ON THE ENDS WRAP AROUND THE SEATAND FASTEN TOGETHER AT OTHER END..???JUST A SUGGESTION WHERE THERES A WILL THERES A WAY""!!!!! =]"
1,AVOID This Cheap Junk,I bought two of these...One for my wife and one for me. My wife's connector at the lighter melted in the car. I attributed this to a defective connecter. Amazon refunded the $$. A few days later and now mine doesn't heat at all. The lighter plug indicator light is on but no heat. I can understand one bad but both? I give it two thumbs down.
4,Works great!,"The seat heats up quickly and I like the fact that I can change the setting from Hi to Low. It is a great product at a great price. I loved this product so much, I decided to order one for my husband's car."
1,Dont buy this.,"Absolutely horrible. Took off hair as it was supposed to, but i have found that this and every other product in the Magic Shave line will absolutely ruin your skin with the most excruciating burning sensation for a long time after use. I used this and it smells extremely strong, even after it is taken off. After using this I could not touch my face because it burns with even the slightest amount of contact, and i cannot wash off any residue because water makes the burning ten times worse. I would not recommend this product- even though it does what it says the aftereffects are worse than razor bumps could ever possibly be. Do not waste your money."
3,It's Ok,This does work. However the hair grew back just as quickly as if you used a razor and you cannot re-use it for 36 hours.
2,SO-SO,The guy that leads the kids through this DVD...'Backpack Jack'...is kind of hokie. Not very interesting. It didn't hold my grandson attention.
2,"neutral, I guess","I gave two stars because I like only 1 of the 2 episodes. The first half (building) is pretty boring...and not just because of the annoying Hard Hat Harry character. The Lumberjacks episode is very interesting to my son who is 2. For seeing building/construction equipment, I recommend the Construction episode. Much more interesting."
5,Necessity for everyone with an 8700,Nearly tripled the battery life of my RIM Blackberry 8700c. A must have for those who travel a lot or just use their phones very frequently.
5,Great Music Energy for meditation,"A yet another amazing accomplishment from Stairway the music has beautiful background vocals (not words) yet wonderful singingmagic even though Jane Relf is not in this cd it still has that magic way that any one who is familiar with Stairway has come to know.I find that I just cant get enough Stairway I have loved everything that I have found by them and would recommend it to any one who likesspiritual meditation music , it is good to dance as well as just listen to. A very wonderfull choice of music"
4,Blue and Rose Periods at there Best,"I've never seen such a great collection of Picasso early figurative work, many of the images have never been published before. This books expands our view of Picasso and his early work. It is definitely the definitive book on Picasso's early year with professional critiques and outstanding images of his most sought after periods.A must for lovers of 20th Century art."
5,In depth study of early years,Very In-Depth study of the early Master Picasso. Only regret are a few small black-white scans of some important works. But overall most paintings are presented nicely. Great history of this period of Picasso!
5,Amazing!,Eek! This is a fabulous book. I wasn't expecting it to be coffee table size...which makes it superb. Rich with photographs that I have never seen before. You must have this!
4,"Rough start, but that was fixable","I almost returned this headset because the mute button didn't work for me. Once I went in and set a few things on my computer, it worked fine. I like the headset because it is similar to my telephone headset. I use the headset for a work at home job. I can easily wear it for hours. I can clearly hear my customers and they can hear me. The mute button does work."
3,You get what you pay for.,"I bought this headset to use mainly for skype. My mic quality was passable but not good, and the sound came through ok, pretty much what you expect from a 20 dollar headset. The problem I had with the headset was the ear speaker was deceptively small and oval shaped, to the point where it only sits on a portion of your ear. This would be fine for short term gaming sessions, but after a long skype call, my ear would be hurting.There also seems to be a blue indicator light that comes on when you plug the headset in, which consistently flashes. This can be annoying if you're in the dark or otherwise.In short this is exactly what you'd expect it to be, a middle-of-the-road headset. It's not going to wow you, but it's cheap and you should be able to use it if your needs are not as specific as mine."
4,Good but hard to find a sweet spot,"This headset works well, but I find myself getting complaints about breathing into the mic - so I move the mic further away, but then people have trouble hearing. Once you find a sweet spot it's solid, but it can take a bit of time to do so."
2,Generates hum,"I like the fact that this covers only one ear. When using Skype I dont want the total immersion of a stereo headset. But this product is not good. The main annoyance for me is that when you turn up the listening volume you get a lot of hum. Methinks a poorly shielded cable - bad design. As others have reported, microphone is not good either - people at the other end have difficulty hearing me. It works - but just not very well."
4,Good headset,"I bought this for internet chat and for gaming online. Works well for both, as well as on the PS3. The only problem, which is minor, is that I will move around and the mute/volume remote on the cord will occasionally and easily get knocked into mute mode without me meaning to do it. This was a replacement of the same model, which broke after about 2 years of use that included a lot of pulling and juggling around, so it can take decent wear."
2,Broke,"I lightly hit my arm against a door frame and the watch stopped and the stem fell out. I hope it has a warranty and I can find it, otherwise I'm out $70!"
2,AIC needs to stick to music...,"I want to start off by saying I love AIC, I've been listening to them for a very long time, but... This video just isn't that funny or entertaining. First off, it's only about twenty minutes long, I guess I was expecting at least a half an hour but oh well. All the ""bits"" they do are all somewhat humorous, but I can only say that I laughed outloud once or twice during the whole thing. If you live, eat, and breath AIC, get this video, but if you think you can live without it pick up one of their CDs, you'll be much happier."
3,There are better Cadfael mysteries,"The story is a bit weak. The poison chosen was difficult to administer, There were better poisons to use. And we are to believe that the murderer would have never been a murderer if one coincidence did not follow another, and another, and another? I find that hard to accept.The bit about the lady being Cadfael's old flame was interesting for the first few pages, but it got old after a while and got in the way of the story."
4,Monk's Hood,"Delightful series. The mysteries are fun - perhaps not the greatest but good enough - but the settings and the characterization are terrific. Like Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey and Materin series (started with Master and Commander), Peters takes you into another time and place, the world when movement was at the speed of the winds (if asea) or a horse (on land) and things just didn't happen nearly as quickly as they do today. Watching Brother Cadfael balance his inner life with his life in the world about him, seeking the answers to riddles of the world of men while pursuing inner peace and perfection through a monastic life, provides the true delights of this series.Peters may not be Louise Penny, but he's awfully good and great fun to read"
3,Masterful Medieval Mystery.................,"This is the first Brother Cadfael mystery that I have read. In the past I have enjoyed the Brother Cadfael Mysteries on PBS and that is what prompted me to read one for myself.The language is difficult to understand at times, (I suggest keeping a dictionary handy)but the mystery is a masterful ""who done it"". In this story the husband of a former love of Cadfaels suddenly dies and it is discovered that the victim was poisoned by the deadly Monk's Hood. The same tincture that Brother Cadfael himself has prepared for medicinal purposes. There is a large cast of characters that may have purpose and reason to murder Gervase Bonel but when the authorities believe the murderer to be his young stepson Brother Cadfael takes matters into his own hands to prove the youth innocent.This is not a light read. Stick with it. You will enjoy it."
4,A GOOD READ,"This book provides a wonderful and witty look at well-to-do society in New York City around the time of World War II. It also gives an intimate view of Army life in the big war. Near the end of the book, the author spends too many pages describing office politics at the NEW YORKER magazine. But I recommend it for its fine writing and good humor."
4,good to file off dead skin from hiking mountains,I use it to file off dead skin from feet before it develops into painful chap that breaks and bleeds
2,Artemis Woman replacement tips impossible to find:(,"Good for rough calloused feet, however, I can no longer find any replacement tips. Thus, I am very dissapointed I purchased the Artemis device in the first place. A very frustrated, dissatisfied customer"
3,Smoother heels,These are definitely better than the smaller tips but still do not work really well on hard calloused feet.
4,a classic,this is a very good well paced western.good actors and good understanding of the characters.
4,taylor is alway good,I wish Robert Taylor had more years of acting.. I like his acting and this show did not let me down a good solid Wetern everyone should see
3,Very Pretty but must be connected to wall switch,I really liked the look of these sconces. Prettier and much heavier than I expected. The only problem with them is that they must be connected to a wall switch. I wanted them to flank my fireplace and was hoping that would have a switch on them to turn them on and off.
2,Frustrating purchase,Do not purchase this product unless you want to blow it up right before each use. It is EXTREMELY hard to blow up - exhausting. Then it stays blown up for about an hour - pops it's own valve open and then deflates. Just not worth all that effort.
1,Broke upon first use,This was a disappointing piece of junk. The plastic stopper that you put into the hole after you blow it up pops out automatically as soon as you put it in. It's completely unusable.
2,"Okay story but ""reformatted"" version still full of errors","Simon finds himself involved when the medical examiner discovers that the body inside a recovered WWII diving suit was knifed, probably because of the gold Confederate coins in his hand. Together with reluctant love-interest Julia, they try to solve a 50-year-old murder with present-day repercussions.This book kept me reading but never really grabbed me. All the characters were fairly one-dimensional but the clues were all there and the story moved right along. Two major flaws contributed to the low rating. First, Simon walked alone into the murderer's lair. That was just stupid. Second, the Kindleization is absolutely awful. There were paragraphs where the words were so jumbled I couldn't even figure out how it was supposed to read, and most dates had disappeared (leaving the sentences meaningless). I'm not even sure why I finished it. The title references one minor event in the book, not related to the main plot at all."
4,Pleasant sniping,"I've become a big fan of Simon Shaw and this book was really quite good. Having lived in North Carolina for a few years, I am quite familiar with the Outer Banks, and the author captures the setting with authenticity. Smoothly written, likeable characters and a curious mystery. Recommended."
3,Easy read.,"I would recommend this book for someone who enjoys a little fun banter with their mysteries. Gets bogged down somewhat every now and then, but is worth the read."
4,Snipe Hunt,A well written and easy to read and get engrossed in. The story was most interesting and kept me wanting to read on . I enjoyed the book immensely.
4,Pleased,"The price is satisfactory according to the product, it is really compact, bivolt works well but can not be used long time,dryer good for travel, practical, lightweight and small.It arrived in perfect condition, on time, is great have tracking number, I followed the delivery by Internet, which gives great confidence to do business. Another item of major importance is the security system made ''by credit card is a more reliable factor in time to close the purchase. I'm pleased. It's a good benefit cost relation."
1,What is Ms. Auel trying to say ?,"This book and indeed all her books after the Clan of the Cave bear fail because of the following reasons :1. Impossible characterization : AYLA and Jondalar are difficult to stomach. They are inventing everything from oral sex, dogs as pets, spear throwers, needles and fire. What will they discover next ? Nuclear power ?2. Sex, sex and more sex : I guess Ms. Auel's intensive research on that era has proved that the pre-historic man (and woman) had raging hormones and had sex an average of 10 times a day, every day.3. Botany, Zoology : Too much detailing. Why elaborate so MUCH !4. No story : Clan of the Cave bear. Now that was a story. The rest of her novels have been immaculately researched survival guides for the pre-historic man !"
3,Exceedingly dull for the most part.....,"The fourth installment of Auel's Earth's Children series seemed to take about as long as the journey back to the Zelandonii must have taken. Honestly, this book could have been cut in half and combined with ""The Mammoth Hunters"" and there wouldn't have been anything amiss. There were a few parts, few and far between, that were rather exciting and kept me reading. However, you have to get to about page 600 before anything really exciting happens. Auel could have ended the series with this book. The ending was satisfactory, unlike the previous installment. However, there is a ton of information about the Ice Age plants, animals, glaciers, etc. in this book. I almost felt like I was reading a Biology textbook or a History textbook instead of a novel about Ayla and Jondalar, the only characters that you really see throughout the entire book with just a few exceptions. Overall, the series has lost much of the magic that hooked me to the first book."
1,an unfinished series is not worth the time invested,"jean auel is never going to finish this series. but it really dosent matter anyway, because she will just repeat excerpts from all the other books over and over again, just like she did in the last 2 books. she has run out of story , before the story was told. i've read all 4 books in the series, but the plains of passage was so repetitious, i could barely keep reading. i've been looking for the last book to be written for years, and it is quite evident, it will not be written. hey, jean! thanks for nothing."
4,Hung...,"I have read CotCB (no joke) at *least* 12 times. I have read the rest all above 3. PoP was a revival. MH was the soap opera of wondering (duh! as if she would pick anyone but J!)who will she pick. VoH was glorious in its own right. But none of it tops CotCB. I think the reason I gave PoP a 4 is that I am still hanging on that cliff. Literally. I am convinced that the rock we see with Ayla at the end of PoP is the same one that Creb always had visions of. So I've been dying to find out if I'm right. I really would like a return to more of the Clan, especially to Durc. I admit I am getting frustrated. I ask when 5 is coming whenever I'm in a bookstore..."
4,"Fantastic as the others, with one exception.","The book takes us on a journey so realistic, that when Ayla is cold, I grab a blanket for warmth...when she fixes Jondular's tea, I get some hot herbal tea. She cooks a bird in the ground, and I can smell the delicious aroma. Jean Auel takes you there! But I am tired of re-hashing so much of her ""past"" (more with each book), that it becomes so boring in parts. If anyone wants to know details of the past, they should read the first books. Perhaps it would not take her so long to write new books, if she didn't have to re-write so much of the former books. I found myself getting angry whenever too much of the past was brought up (again and again and again). Will I read the last book? YOU BET!"
5,STILL WAITING,I am a big fan of Auel. I was waiting for the next book in the series. I missed her talk at my local college a few years back. This book and all of them delves into the construct that two forms of human life may have been around at the same time. This is a theory some scientists see as a possibility! END
2,Decent,"I've read all four books in the series. I loved the first bookespecially. This book seemed to me to be the weakest of the four. Asmany others have noted, the majority of it was made up of plant lore. The actual amount of plot made up perhaps 100-200 pages, I'm guessing (although I haven't counted to make sure), out of 800 pages or so. I too am curious as to how the series will finish, although it's been long enough that I've pretty much moved on. If it were available, I would suggest the condensed version of this book."
1,Passage Repeats,"So disappointed. It's just the same ""passages"" over and over and over.The only new additions to the story line were left undeveloped, or led back over the same old material, again and again.Spoiler Alert! All the rest of the books are just as much of a let down.I want my money back, and the beautiful story I had originally been told. Should have left good enough alone and not been greedy to publish more."
2,Unimaginative and re-hash-tastic,"Oh man...What a lump of coal....I guess I realize now why I had never heard about the latter 2 additions to the Earths Children series until I started running a bookstore and came face to face with them...This effort is so boringly written it made me wish I was a guy who could not finish something that I start, but I cant... So I struggled through and now it is done, but if anyone out there is trying to decide - save yourself the time, and just take a few sleeping pills instead..."
3,Dissappointing,"I thought it was just because I'm much older now than I was when the previous books in the series came out that I was not as thrilled with Plains of Passage. But after reading numerous other reviews, I see that may not be the case. Much of what I feel about this book has been expressed in other reviews. It was way too descriptive and spent much too much time in the caves exploring cave paintings. I got a bit tired of Ayla being so ""perfect"" a human being most of the time. There was so much repetition, too. I devoured the other books and remembered quite a bit of the story. I didn't need to be reminded over and over again what had transpired. This book was just too long and wordy."
3,a question,I''m just wondering wy the Mammoth Hunters and The PLains of Passage aren't currently available on eBook and when they will be again? Does anyone know? It doesn't make much sense to only have 2/3 of the series available of reading on the Kindle...
3,Digital Book,Didn't really use the extra bonus. A lot of regurgitated moments from the past books which makes it drag...didn't really like this particular one in the series.
3,going home,"After reading the three previous books, Clan of the Cave Bear, Valley of Horses, and the Mammoth Hunters, I was really looking forward to Ayla and Jondalar heading to his home territory. But the book seemed to drag and I was tired of the repeat saving of people. Finally after three fourth of the way through the book they are back on track, then it fades again until the last few chapters finally come through and it is over. I am tired of waiting for Ms. Auel to come to terms with the publisher. She should have honored the contract she had signed with the first book, or should have a better attorney to advise her in case the book was the hit that it became. However, she signed and should at least honored her promise to the publisher, and to the many fans that came to love her Ayla. Now I am not so sure I will purchase another book by this author."
1,Plains of Passage,"First book was awesome! The rest gradually get really, really BORING! I am not going to get mean, so I'll just say this: this book was the biggest let down ever! I don't think that I will read the last one."
4,"A good series, but seriously flawed","Ms. Auel's editor should be reprimanded for so much repetition. Plains of Passage was at least a 50% rehash of the first 3 books. I would like a next volume in the series--there were lots of threads to resolve. But this time without the repetition from the earlier books including the 2-3pp long descriptions of climatic conditions, and the 2-3 pp long scenes of what amounts to soft-core porn."
1,Looking for a book to help you sleep? This is it!,"It's amazing that this fourth book in the series can be more boring than the third book. It's almost as amazing that I could force myself to read the whole book -- I guess the first two books instilled some serious loyalty in me. My review for the third book holds for this book too, only it's worse than that:This whole book seems like filler that Jean M. Auel inflicted on us just because she decided this series should have six books in it before she started the series. The book is overflowing with boring sex scenes -- if I wanted this much sex in a book, I think I know where to look for something like that, but it wouldn't ever be anything by Jean M. Auel."
2,the longest and most boring of the series,"That's right. This book has endless and boring descriptions of Ayla's journey to Jondalar's home. It becomes repetitive at times. The character of Jondalar becomes even more hideous than before since he wants to get home as soon as possible which means he gets annoyed with Ayla's only friends. He wants to get rid of Woolf and even Winnie at some point. Besides he is throwing Ayla into an uncertain future.How can you like a book when you hate one of the ""heroes"" of the story?The evil women ruled tribe was way over the top. I seriously doubt something like that actually existed and if it did, it was a shame they didn't kill Jondalar.the only interesting thing about his book is when they meet with this couple of blonde neanderthals. I think Ayla is better off with them than with Jondalar. I will buy the fith book, let's see if 12 years of research made it better than this one..."
2,From bad to worse,About 80% of this book os rewritten from the last books in this series. she has clearly run out of ideas. do not waste your money.
2,"Too much exposition, too little plot.","Auel takes information she has about prehistoric times and delivers it, again and again, ad infinitum, whether it is relevant to the story and characters or not. Much of the information had already been provided in previous books of this series. Read the other three, but not this one."
5,Mind-blowingly Good - best read ever,"This series of books has changed my views and approach to life more than any other experience in my life to date. Like everyone else, I impatiently await Book 5 (and 6 for that matter). I did hear (3rd hand) that Ms Auel has been ill and this is why book 5 hasn't been completed. I hope the illness is not too serious (not only for selfish reasons). I'm sure I can speak for all Ms Auel's readers when I would ask that she (or someone on her behalf) publish an announcement on the WWW letting us all know how she is."
3,Typos typos typos,"One of my favorite books, but the typographical errors are very distracting and also, in some passages quite confusing."
3,Too much sex for too little story.,"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00466HQ0G/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgThis book gives me the feeling that Auel didn't have enough story to fill out the number of words she contracted for, so she inserts sex scenes everywhere she can think of. Really, they get highly boring after a while. Most of her readers are adults who have had their own sexual experience, and don't need graphic details on every third page. This book could have been much better if it were about two thirds of its actual length."
2,Can't hold my interest,"I read the first 3 books many years ago and loved them. I simply could not get into this book. The characters seemed much too modern day to be set in a story about the stone age. Very repetitive information, reiterating thoughts and occurrences multiple times chapter to chapter. I was profoundly disappointed. I'm almost halfway through the book and have simply moved on to other reading entertainment."
2,Weak,Far too much misunderstanding of anthropology and the prehistoric record to be a plausible story. I came close to giving up on the book several times.
3,Worth a read,"Although difficult to compose a story such as this, Auel didn't do too bad, although there are some pretty far out characters along the way, a bit unbelievable. Some bits dragged while they hiked over endless plains and glaciers. Worth reading once, and then again just before you pick up Shelters of Stone (if you do) so you can remember where they left off."
4,WHEN IS THE NEXT ONE?,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SERIES!! I HAVE REREAD THEM MANY TIMES. BUT I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS! I AM NEW TO THE COMPUTOR THING SO WHEN I PULLED UP THE REVIEWS I WAS SHOCKED TO KNOW THERE ARE MORE JEAN AUEL JUNKIES OUT THERE. I AM NO LONGER ALONE!! LIKE EVERYONE ELSE I AM ANXIOUS TO KNOW THE REST OF THE STORY. DOES ANYBODY KNOW HOW TO FIND OUT WHEN THE 5TH IN THE SERIES COMES OUT? I MEAN HOW MUCH LONGER DO WE HAVE TO WAIT? JONDALAR AND AYLA HAVE SO MUCH AHEAD OF THEM. I CAN'T WAIT ANY MORE. DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY INFO ON THIS??? PLEASE HELP ME FIND SOME ANSWERS!!!
3,The worst one yet.,To me it seemed almost repetitive with each tribe they got to. It started getting boring and there's too much talk about the scenery. This story didn't have much of an ending. The book shows how Ayla adjusts to each tribe except Jondalar's. If there is a number 5 I'd probably get it only to see what comes next.
4,Praise for the Plains of Passage,"I have enjoied all four of the Earth's Children Series, and while The Plains of Passage at times laged a bit, the characters I have come to love are at it again! Auel has done an excelent job of describing the scenes and creating intrigue..."
5,I loved this one and the first three,"I truly loved the whole series and have been waiting years for the next one. Please don't let all of your avid fans down, give us number 5!"
3,The Plains of Passage,"This was the sixth book in a series, I found the first 3 excellentbut The Plains of passage was very repetitive and long drawn outI think the author could have reduced the number of books to fourThe amount of detail and research she put into all the books is amazing"
4,= ),"Since I only recently heard of the books, its amazing that I'm already half way through with the fourth book. The books are so hard to put down. Though some people find the scenes repetive, the book puts Europe(Germany), where I was born, in a whole new perspective. Also, having the travel scenes in between the ""action"" scenes makes you want to read more. And even though I doubt people talked like that 35,000 years ago, it makes the book easier to put yourself in the place of the characters. This book was great, though Auel will never be able to top her 1st book in the series, The Clan of the Cave Bear."
2,Too much detail,"I have read all the books in this series, and one thing I've noticed is that each subsequent volume is more superflous than the last in terms of detail. Auel does a great job in the first two books of describing the plantlife, people, and both physical and emotional feelings of each character. Unfortunately, she continues her series with more and more detailed explanations, even of things she's described before. I was curious how many times she felt I needed to be reminded what a ""mother statuette"" looked like. Once that has been described in a book, it should not be described again unless there are significant differences. Anyway, I love the story and would rate this book at 5 stars easily if only it weren't so long winded."
2,Sex and Scenery,"What went wrong with Jean Auel? Her series went downhill fast after the first book, and by the third I was beginning to wonder if she'd run out of plot! It was over 50% 'filler' --- descriptions of the scenery, the sex, and a contrived love triangle that made me want to step in and mediate so we could get on with the story. Fans of the series might be able to hang on long enough to finish this book, but if you're not already hooked you're better off to walk away from this worm!"
3,Where it started going downhill,"Unfortunately, this book is where the Earth's Children series started going downhill. In retrospect, it is midway between the excellence of the Mammoth Hunters and the Shelters of Stone."
1,"EXCELENTE PRIMER LIBRO, LEEENTO EL CUARTO !","Un resúmen:El clan del oso cavernario: EXCELENTE, INSPIRADOR.El valle de los caballos: BUENA SECUELA, RECOMENDABLE.Los cazadores del mamut: SOLO PARA FANS.El libro de los viajes (""Plains""): REPETITIVO, LENTO Y ABURRIDO EN DOS TERCERAS PARTES (LA'ÚLTIMA PARTE, COMO EN ""cazadores"", PARA FANS).....LA ESPERANZA....""The Shelter of stone""...donde los que admiramos a Ayla, esperamos reencontrarnos con ella..."
4,Very absorbing book,"I love this series. The characters are well developed and the travel scenes are rich in detail. My only problem with Auel's writing style is she is too repetitive for me. Oh, and I wish, as a download, it had been a little cheaper for such an old book."
2,other reviews are correct,Thank goodness this wasn't the first book in the series! Other reviewers are correct: Auel spends too much time describing flora and fauna. I just skipped over these parts until I saw a character's name or quotation marks. The tedious descriptions do not add anything to the storyline.
2,Too much repetition and gratuitous sex,I enjoyed the first two books a lot but then I started noticing the repetition in the third book. Auel feels the need to completely retell the entire story in every book so the repetition gets worse with each book. Starting with the third book I got the feeling that the author decided to use graphic sex scenes to sell more books. I don't think I will read the fifth book.
3,PLAINS OF PASSAGE,"While this series is a beautiful love story, it is also an amazing look at the Ice Age ......I can understand the research that was involved and the excitement of the author. However, there are many passages that the average reader will find too detailed.That will not keep me from reading the entire series. I am thoroughly enjoying the story and learning how man evolved and made discoveries."
1,Disappointing book!,"After reading some of the recent entries, its good to know that my disappointments in this book are shared by some other readers. The Plains of Passage seems to immensely lack the quality of the earlier books in the series and the 'adventures' of the main characters, Ayla and Jondalar, reminded me vividly of the reality of the 'moralizing' that so many 'explorers' have done to indigenous peoples. Even with this aside, I felt that the book was poorly written and extremely over-drawn; I often found myself skiping over entire chapters without feeling as though I had missed any of the story or character development (or, more accurately, in both cases the lack thereof)."
3,Frustrating,"The frustration I have with this book (and also with the fifth book in the series) is that, after reading the Clan of the Cave Bear, I know the talent of which this author is capable. We do not, unfortunately, see much of that talent in this book.Readers do not appreciate being treated as though they lack intelligence, and the extreme repetition found in this book (and in the fifth book) sends the reader the message that she is just too stupid to remember what went on before.So much of the book became tedious and boring. Even the [love] scenes were repetitive. You could sum it all up by saying that Jondalar is quite a lover. Jondalar has a really big .... manhood. Ayla is as vunerable as a virgin, yet deep enough to take in all of Jondalar, which Jondalar really digs.Readers feel cheated because the first book was so very, very good. But now it seems that all we are getting for our loyalty and anticipation is a lazy, repetitive effort."
5,the greatest of all...,"This is the first book I read in the series. It somehow hooked me. What I love most is the way things were describe in details eg. the herbs Ayla prepared, the cookings, etc. Besides this, it also describe on the prehistoric life not to mention the animals life cycle. It is a great book."
5,How much longer must we wait for #5?,"I love this series and am waiting to hear news of the next release. The Plains of Passage was as discriptive and exciting to read as the previous three, but I have to know...what happens next Ms. Auel? Please feed our need!"
2,I hope the next one is better than this,"I have loved this series from the start, but while the last book was a little boring for me, this book really takes the boredom up a notch and fills in scenes which should be action with sex. There's very little to recommend this book, aside from the fact that it's the next in the series, and now I'm wondering if I will pick up her future books. I also felt the characters were too modern, thinking in ways that only modern people think in due to technology, which obviously didn't exist back then.Give this one a pass, unless you are desperate to continue the series."
2,Here We Go Again...,"Unfortunately, I have to agree with a lot of the other reviewers of this book. It's tedious and repetitious (especially of the events in book 3). I appreciate Jean Auel's detail on plants and animals, and like a good adventure story like anyone, but she recover sthe same ground too much. Also, I thought book 2 had a lot of sex scenes, but this book reads like a Harlequin romance novel! Yes, we get it, the characters have a lot of time on their hands and no TV to be entertained. I seriously think the book could have trimmed a couple hundred pages and would work much better. I am curious what Auel will write for book 6 and when it will be released."
1,"If I read the word ""node"" one more time I might have wretched...","If you want to read a book about how female anatomy looks like pink/silkly/flowerly petals for 400 pages (along with how the Auel thinks the word ""node"" is apparently an attractive way to reference the [...]) please do buy this book.You get a bonus 800 pages describing mammoth sex, plants and dirt formations.The remaining thousand pages of this hideously long failure all deal with superwoman Ayla's ability to do everything perfectly. [...].I only got through this book by skimming past entire chapters, which, I rarely do."
2,Cut & Paste,"I am re-reading the series prior to the publication of the final book. Perhaps, if I had not been reading these books one after the other, I would not have been as bothered by the endless repetition of events from previous books; but back to back, it was more than tedious. I did discover one serious problem with the Kindle while reading this book -- one cannot through it across the room in frustration after endless references to the coldest place on earth that the glacier is growing for the last time, only to be exceeded by endless repetitive sex scenes. Most romance novels don't devote as much time to any single sex encounter or have as many in a book. How did they have time to do anything else? The plot of this book could have been told in about a hundred pages rather than some 700.I am going to read the next book and buy the finale of the series. I am hoping she actually writes a new story soon."
2,As expected,"I knew it was going to be repetetive, because I'd read 1,2,3 and 5. Certain phrases just kept popping up, for example,"" What would I do without you?"" says Jondalar. And don't forget the ever-present frown lines for good measure.The authors description of the Ice Age animals were amazing though, especially the mammoths.The storyline was just too...well, i suppose romantic. Don't get me wrong, I love romance books, but I expected an adventure. Not to say that a Journey across a continent isn't an adventure, but there were so many aspects of the novel that were too Mills &Boon.; There were plenty of opportunities for Jondalar to prove his manliness and possessiveness, lots of petty fights- but of course they make up, kiss, have wild sex with, once again, Jondalar proving his manliness.After a while, the whole thing with Jondalar being beautiful, Ayla being gorgeous and kind and loving, it just gets too boring. Is anyone else sick if Aylas ptarmigan?"
1,yawn,"I liked clan of the Cave Bear, ok, so I was 12 when I read it, but I thought it was ok. By the the time this book came around I was soo bored. I don't care what happens to Ayla or any of the other pathetic characters in this overblown Paleolithic Mills and Boon and I won't bother to read any further... It's worse than Melanie Rawn, if you can believe that."
3,"Didn't like this as much as 1-3, eagerly awaiting #5","I started reading Jean M. Auel's books in grade school, and loved them. My favorite so far is Mammoth Hunters, because I liked all the characters in it. I have been impatiently waiting for book #5; what a cliffhanger to leave us on in Plains of Passage! I have not heard what is causing the delay, but my own theory is that since much of the research Ms. Auel does is centered in Czechoslovakia, the war must have interrupted it, and perhaps she is having difficulty getting permission to travel into what is now several countries. Has anyone heard when the next book will be out?"
3,"Too much herbal encyclopedia, not enough actual story","I love this entire series, but The Plains of Passage was too much a description of every minute detail of the plain's flora and fauna, and not enough story. I think it should have been added to the end of the Mammoth hunters instead. It seems like Ms. Auel was contracted to do five books and so she is doing five, even though there is really only enough story to do four. Perhaps her intention was to make us feel the year's worth of Journey like Jondalar and Ayla did. I also wish we could buy these in a volume where the story just continues and we don't have to read blurbs here and there describing what we already know from the previous books. If you're reading them all at once, all in a row, these bits of ""information"" really interfere with the story's continuity"
2,Not as good as it should have been.,"Sex and scenery, over and over. And, the ""Ayla discovers everything significant"" theme is getting old. It was almost believable in the ""Mammoth Hunters"", but fell apart in ""Plains"". Still, I read it a couple of times, just because the story is left as a cliffhanger in ""Mammoth"", that I had to know what happens next. I think the years were too long between ""Plains"" and the new book, though!"
2,Repetitious--Too Little Plot,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the Earth Children's series and just re-read the entire 4 books. In this book, however, I had the feeling the author was trying to ""remind"" herself about the characters even more so than bringing the reader up-to-date on each character. It didn't have the feel of ""Jean Auel"" in many parts. Too much repetition of information and too little plot. I hope books 5 and 6--if ever written and published--have more plot."
4,Clever & Addictive,"I've read the four books in Jean Auel's Earth's Children series and loved them all. Ayla and Jondalar are amazing lead characters and very well written/developed. I loved reading about their discoveries - like taming wild animals, creating new hunting weapons and making a sewing needle - which helped ensure their survival and made them mystical to the people they encountered. Auel creates a clever and vivid picture of how people during that time lived and saw the world. Very imaginative and a joy to read. I can't wait for her next book."
5,Excellent Book!,"I absolutly loved this book and dispite all comments, don't think it was a ""trashy"" book at all. It portrayed excellent writing and discriptions. I loved the charecters and animals and was deeply moved by their struggles. Don't let other's reviews sway you, read this book yourself and discover it's timeless story."
4,This is my favorite.,"I enjoyed this book. It let Ayla and Jon get to know each other one-on-one, instead of in a large group setting. I think they got a chance to learn to rely on one another. Can't wait to see if it's a girl or a boy!!"
5,Fantastic,What a pefect set of books to read on a lazy weekend . I read them once a year and get caught up in the adventure everytime .Can't wait for the next one.I hope she dosen't make us wait to much longer .
3,"The story line is wonderful, but the sex was too graphic.","I thought the characters in the story were very personable, and the whole series has a wonderful and believable plot. However, the depictions of sexual encounters leave absolutely NOTHING to the imagination, and lowers the book to the level of the trashy romance novel. If it weren't so shockingly explicit, I would gladly recommend it to anyone as quality literature."
3,Get a Better Scanner - for Kindle version only,"I've noticed this in all of Auel's books on the Kindle. The scanner or whatever they use did a terrible job. Way too many errors in words. Fir for Fur, etc. So far, however, The Plains of Passage is the worst one for erros that I have read. Amazon should be ashamed of itself for letting it get onto the Kindle in such a poor copy."
3,Quick read,"the numerous sex scenes were mostly the same old same old. Between mammoth sex, Ayla sex, horse sex, there was a fairly interesting story line. Skip the sex, as it was virtually nothing new each time it came up, and it was a quick read."
4,Prehistoric Romance,"Someone wrote that this romance between two prehistoric people is similar to our own time.Well that is so true.From the get go,Ayla has been abused and she finally finds love and kindness in a man who knows what it is all about.So it is fiction,so it is not correct in some of its details,so what,it is a story that is refreshing and realestic and makes a very good read.Each of her previous books are seperate stories of the same,or diffrent chapters of the same book.Many Authors write this way,Wilbur Smith is an example of this.But Where is No.5.Love this but please dont stop now Ms.Auel"
5,The Plains of Passage,See my review of The Valley of Horses. This 4th book in the Earth Childrens Series is like the rest; EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Almost too boring for words,"Number 4 in the Earth Children Series, that should have stopped at number 3. This book details Ayla and Jondalar as they return to his home on the other side of Europe. The book is detailed indeed, but the days are nearly all the same: They get up, they travel, they hunt,they cook, they camp, they make love, they sleep, they get up, they travel, etc. etc. If this review is boring you, you get a glimpse of the character of this book. All the time, they travel, I think they will meet with someone who will add some interest, but no such luck. The only encounter they finally have is in the last quarter of the book, and while that part of the story is interesting, it doesn't make up for the rest. Very disappointing"
2,Like watching grass grow!!!,"I'm 300 pages into this book, and I'm still waiting for something to happen. Please tell me something is going to happen... soon... PLEASE!!! Throw me a freaking bone, man! Not sure I can take this anymore!"
3,Completely anticlimactic!,"Auel takes painstaking efforts to describe all of the trials, tribulations, and people that Ayla and Jondalar meet on their long journey from the Mamutoi summer meeting to the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii,and yet when they finally meet the Lanzadonii and then make their final trek to the Zelandonii, the story just completely falls apart. The strange dreams Ayla has been having all along apparently mean that she is meant to have a home there with Jondalar, but I just didn't feel it. I have felt so many emotions throughout these books, and at the end of this one, which I was so looking forward to, I felt nothing. It was so disappointing. I hope the 5th and final book has a more satisfying ending."
1,disappointing,"I decided to try this workout after reading the previously posted positive reviews, but I was so disappointed that this one will probably be going to half-price books. I wouldn't even pass it along to a friend. The voice-over is way too loud over the music, and the voice is not at all the calming type one would expect for yoga. I ended up turning it way down and playing classical music over it. The cueing was equally frustrating as I had to keep craning my neck to look at the screen and understand what was being described. The workouts were not challenging in either the areas of strength or flexibility, nor did tery flow well from beginning to end. Skip this one; try Rodney Yee instead."
4,Don't let the nattering know-it-all naysayers fool you,"I recommend all three of William L. Scott's books [""Investing at the Racetrack,"" ""How Will Your Horse Run Today?"" and ""Total Victory at the Track""] for both beginning and experienced handicappers. The books are written in an easy-to-read style that any schmuck can understand, and packed with practical insight into the mechanics of picking winners without a lot of subjective guesswork."
4,Investing at the racetrack,This book was a very good book in terms of rating horses on their ability to make it to the finish line well. I found the ability time calculations inside of the book easy to master. In many practice runs of handicapping the races I would have hit some longshots as well as the favorites in many instances more than if I would have useed other handicapping methods.
2,Wish I had saved my money.,"While this isn't a ""bad"" CD, I wish that I hadn't bought it and instead had saved my money. I listened to it once and will never listen to it again. I recommend you buy this ONLY if you are a HUGE fan of the movie. This CD didn't bring back any fond memories of the movie, and I did like the movie a lot."
1,Not as good as previous years.,"We have been avid fans of the Lego Advent Calendar but this year, so far it has been a bunch of mini-figures. Previous year's calendars had a variety of characters like birds, angels, etc. This year's version so far is pretty boring. I probably won't purchase these again if they continue to produce a calendar that is so non-exciting."
2,Air War For Burma,"I enjoyed Bloody Shambles Volume 1 and Volume 2. It was just as well this book was not labeled Volume 3, because it is nothing like the first two books, as it lacks all the variety of interviews and stories included in the first two volumes, which made them great. All-in-all a big disappointment."
3,Great microphone clip for someone on a budget,This is an inexpensive microphone clip for those needing such a solution on a budget. Give it a shot if you are looking for a microphone clip. This is probably not a great option for shotgun microphones.
2,"If I could go back, I wouldn't buy it.","I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 because it was honestly my fault buying one this cheap anyway. It worked just fine, until about 2 or so months after I got it my microphone stand fell, but not very far and hit the floor (which was carpet I might add), but not very hard at all and the clip snapped incredibly easily, I couldn't really expect otherwise because before it broke it was painfully obvious to tell that any tension at all would break it in an instant, and thus you had to be careful putting your mic in.So to sum it up, if you want a cheap, fragile, and easily breakable, BUT cheap microphone clip, then that is exactly what this is."
1,Doesn't last,"I bought two of these for my 11 year old son and within 3 weeks both were broken. They are made of plastic and will hold the microphone but if you are prone to removing the microphones on a regular basis they won't last too long. Other comments say ""not for road use"" but I sill expected greater durability. This is a case of you get what you pay for."
2,Loose clip,"We've had this clip for about 8 months now and I find the screw part that connects where the microphone goes to the part that screws into the stand is loose and allows the microphone and clip to slide easily and not stay in position. We didn't pay a lot for this, so maybe it's just a matter of you get what you pay for it."
4,Solid Replacement Mic Clip,"For the price, which is about half of what I've found the Shure brand clips, this is a solid replacement option. This DOES have a threaded brass insert just like the Shures. Why this is not shown in the description is baffling. Yes they will break eventually but that is why I carry several in my gig bag. I found it to be cheap insurance and much easier than taping a mic to the stand for the evening. If you have a ""standard"" mic or basically any mic with a barrel similar to the SM58 or 57 this will work fine. I added some pictures so that you can see some additional angles of the clip."
5,Good mic clip,"Not sure there is much to say about a mic stand clip.Solid plastic. Brass threading. Adjustable pivot screw.I've always been pleased with On Stage products, even down to there cheap $3 clips."
2,Too Small for some mics,I bought these mics to fit a shure mic and a GLS mic and it doesn't fit either. A little too small.
5,Euro style,Package says Euro style but don't know what that means. Holds almost any mic in place and securely. No issues.
4,Good Clip,Functional clip - does the job. Great option for Amazon to be offering add-on products like this. I was very pleased with this purchase.
3,Mike clip,The microphone clip fit perfectly on my stand and it's easy for me to pull my mike out and sing away! Thx ; D
2,Replaced it with another,replaced it with a spring loaded clip. Clip is very tight holding the mic. Clip does not allow the mic to slide in very far. Clip and mic were both matched for the same barrel size. Clip also feels like it is about to break when mic is inserted. It is ok if you never need to remove the mic.
2,Can not use them,"I picked something wrong. They are too small for regular mics. They are very well made, so if they fit your mic they will be perfect."
1,Not suited for mic ordered,"Disappointed that this product did not fit the Hisonic HA1228B mic system ordered, but yet it was paired with the unit. Need to have a better matching system."
5,Works for Me,"I had no problems with this product. Just screw it onthe mic stand and away you go. One thing. It is notmetal, but plastic.Christian? God wants you rich for a purpose. Go to[...]"
5,must have for large format photography,"i use this primarily for cleaning 4x5 neg carriers so that my photographs aren't filled with black dust after exposure. although now that i've gone the route of digital printing, it isn't that much of an issue. nonetheless, this is an awesome product for cleaning dust of off lenses, negatives, pretty much any surface with dust on it. the great thing about the product is that you're not just moving the dust from one place to another, but you're picking up the dust."
4,This is an easy-to-check kit. It's a purely ...,This is an easy-to-check kit. It's a purely visual test kit that's checked by comparing the color change on the test strip to the color printed on the vial label. This makes it easy to find a urinary tract infection before consulting the doctor. (Anyone who's colorblind should be cautious in deciding there's an infection.)
5,Soul Quenching Expression,"Making great music lies in the ability to express things words can't, to touch the soul, capture the moment and move the heart.It takes a great artist to perform great music!Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg is such an artist and this release is one of her many gifts to the music loving world!"
5,"Encores, indeed..........","....In some of her other albums, Nadja takes things a bit too slowly for my taste, but these small ""encore"" pieces are right up her alley. This record is 71' 12"" of pure entertainment. Not that they're easy to perform....I'll mention a few highlights of the great music Nadja and Sandra Rivers made together....for me, the high point is Georg Kroll's ""Banjo and Fiddle""...six of the fourteen tracks are Fritz Kreisler pieces to which Nadja does full justice...the title cut is superbly done, as is the other Gershwin piece, and the one Scott Joplin offering [I wish there had been more].This is a wonderful album; if you heard Nadja's Brahams Concerto, are ready to forgive her, and give her another chance, this record is for you...you won't be sorry."
5,MY KIDS LOVE IT!!!!!,"My kids LOVE this DVD!!! I bought it because I love to scuba dive and thought it would be nice. I was not prepared for my children (ages 5, 7 and 11) to want to have it play ALL THE TIME!! They are in awe of the beauty of underwater and the music is soothing and peaceful. I had to buy another one because my sister took mine for her kids. I also gave my whole family one for Christmas. I highly recommend this!!!"
3,I liked the fact that it's all natural. ...,I liked the fact that it's all natural. But I thought it left a weird aftertaste. My children also didn't like the taste. But it cleaned their teeth great.

4,"My puppy totally loves, but is NOT indestructable","My border collie/german shepherd puppy absolutely loves this toy, but within a few minutes he had alreadly chewed off one of the 'tails'. So we play fetch with it, but I cannot leave it laying about the house."
1,I had to force myself to finish it.,"It is pieces like About Yvonne that mystify me as to exactly how some authors manage to get published. Trudging though this book was almost a chore (luckily, it was short and didn't require much deep speculation). The main character is so desperately shallow and pathetic it is impossible to feel any kind of sympathy or empathy for her. The book is so replete with annoying redundancies and cliches and clumsily written ""erotica,"" it probably would have been better if the author spared us and contained it to a short story. Masini writes about New York like a person who has never been to New York, writes about art galleries like a person who has never been to an art gallery, and writes about sex like a person who's never...well, you get the idea."
4,it really does feel like that,"I read this book right after it came out, when I was going through a divorce on grounds of...you got it. While some (many?) of Terry's actions are over the top and perhaps not believable, her feelings about the affair are completely *true*. I was convinced Masini must have gone through the same thing in order to write it so well. I just went back and re-read the pages I dog-eared -- I still remember feeling just as Terry does on pgs.295, 86, 204,..."
1,There is such a thing as trying too hard...,"...and this novel is proof of that. Masini's trying so hard to be intellectual, psychological, and New York hip that she kind of forgets what the story's about and as a result, so do we readers. The premise is fantastic, too bad it had to be drowned out by excessive waffling and maddeningly inaccurate NYC references. Oh, yeah, and the more-bored-than-insane protagonist didn't help, either..."
5,About Yvonne must be purchased to be understood.,"About Yvonne is misrepresented in blurbs and synopses. I've shown this novel to street poets and university professors, from US Marines to hairdressers. They have all torn through the book, commenting on its narrative drive as well as the poetry of its language. About Yvonne is so much more than a sexy thriller. It's a literary tour de force that makes you want to turn pages.About Yvonne has been misrepresented in blurbs and synopses. This novel is so much more than a sexy thriller. I've shown it to US Marines and downtown hairdressers, street poets and university professors. They all turn pages, and they all comment on the narrative pace as well as its language. About Yvonne is the most exciting novel I've read this summer."
5,AY.,"About Yvonne is clearly either a book one loves or hates. Certainly everyone has differing opinions, but to question the books lack of depth and to call it predictable puzzles me. One reviewer commented that the lack of depth in the novel was what bothered them most. The reviewer considered the ideals expressed in the novel; love, sex, religion, obsession and poetry to be the most cliche topics imaginable. Topics that apparently are not what affects humanity the most. So, if you agree with that and are turned off by sometimes brash and obscene diction then skip this, if you prefer a walk on the wild side (the novel kept me enthralled) and can roll with it, then please, read it."
1,disapointed,When I placed the order I thought it came with the fire pit. When I looked back to see the order the picture was changed to a picture with just a screen. I wouldn't have made the mistake if I saw that picture. When I tried to return it the shipping fee was $56.00. That is more than the screen is worth. I reported this to Amazing Firepits and they wouldn't do anything about it.Disappointed
2,Where is the heat?,"This is a nice looking machine with a convenient clearance under the filter, which allow to use almost any cup or bowl. But... it is not very reliable and the temperature of the coffee is below acceptable. I had to send it for repair after 2 years as it was no heating at all i.e. no steam and cold coffee. They replaced a terminal strip but it came back with the same low heating performance."
1,wrobel2@myfairpoint.net,"This morning, the machine is just a little over two years old, it would not turn on. I also purchased the Breville kettle, which died after 13 months. I will not buy any Breville products again and I encourage anyone who has products still under warranty to return them, making up a problem for an exchange to ensure you get a longer life out of them. I am out hundreds of dollars."
1,Dead On Arrival,"This unit arrived DOA. The pump was blown. Furthermore, the box was unsealed and split on one side, an indication that I may have received one of the poorly / not really refurbished units others have posted about.I bought it based on 3rd party consumer site reviews, which rated this unit highly. However, had I read the negative reviews here on Amazon, I'd have known that these Breville units are plagued with problems.Avoid."
2,DON'T COUNT ON GOOD SERVICE FROM BREVILLE,"I purchased a Breville 800ESXL Espresso Maker because it appeared to be a very well built, solid machine. After very limited use, the entire steam wand assembly broke off. I contacted Breville, but they refused to do anything because it happened outside the 1 year warranty. They gave me a list of authorized non-warranty repair stations. Of the 7 locations given to me for California, the nearest one is in San Francisco - about 2+ hrs away from Sacramento where i live. I'm trying to find an independent servicer in the Sacramento area, but so far have had no luck. Check for local service before you buy!"
1,Not worth it..,"I was so ecstatic when I made this purchase and thought that spending more money would give better quality. I was wrong of course. The one thing I did not like while it was working was that the motor is extremely loud. The machine was great while it lasted, however it was used less than twenty times during the two years I had it. Now the machine will not turn on. After reading everyone else's reviews of the customer service and the cost to fix the machine, I'm thinking it is not worth it."
1,Not durable,Got this machine two and a half years ago. Worked fine and then stopped heating water. I will definitely look for a more durable machine. Australia for a espresso machine -- what was I thinking?
2,"Made great espresso, until it broke","A few weeks ago a small hard plastic tube piece (with a diameter about the size of a dime) fell out of the underside of our Breville Die-Cast Espresso Machine 800ESXL. Since that time our espresso has been weak and watery, just a little espresso with a lot of cream actually. I confirmed that we're grinding our beans to the right fineness. We've had the machine for a few years, but for this price, it should have lasted longer."
2,died after 6 weeks,The machine wouldn't turn on one morning. Only had it 6 weeks. (We make about 25 espresso/wk)Steamer wand head is lame. Knob/lever feels stiff... like it's starting to cease when you turn it. Espresso cookie is mushy and a pain in the @ss to get out of the portafilter. (Messy--have to scoop it out). Pushes shot out too fast. Shot is sometimes watery.
5,Breville 800ESXL Espresso machine,"I bought this wonderful machine couple of weeks ago. It makes a great espresso. Some reviewers have stressed that the coffee is not hot enough, and it did happen to me also, but if you pre-warm your machine until the upper plate is hot, you will get a hot coffee, no doubt. The manual recommends to discharge one shot without coffee to warm up the inner parts of the machine. I did that too. Result: a lovely creamy hot shot. The residual water container is half so small as the fresh water container, so you need to pay attention not to let it overflow. I feel that the money was well spend.Ricardo Sinclair, Panama"
3,"Great Espresso, Bad Latte","This machine is beautiful and makes excellent espresso. However, if you like to make Latte and other milk-based drinks, you're in for a disappointment. When you start the steam/frothing process The first thing it does is dump a half a cup of water into your milk. When the steam finally comes out, it is visibly ""wet"" and adds yet more water to the milk. I thought I would outsmart it and let it dump the initial water into another cup, turn the knob to ""stand-by"", and then, assuming the steam chamber is hot and pressurized, use it to steam my milk. No dice - the machine for some foresaken reason releases the accumulated steam from its pressure chamber when you put it into stand-by mode, so each time you steam a new cup of milk, you have to go through the same watery process again, diluting your latte. Too bad - because otherwise this is a 5-star item."
2,Hard-to-find filters clog easily,"This machine is indeed beautiful, and I find the espresso very good indeed. The problem is that if your coffee is ground too fine, even once, the filter clogs. Due to the design of the crema filter, there is an inaccessible ""interior"" between the coffee-side filter holes and the bottom-side single exit hole. If this gets too clogged, there is really nothing to do except get a new filter, as the clog is not reachable with any tool.This wouldn't be too bad if you could actually GET filter baskets when you need them. The only online company that carried them seems to be out of business now. And without a filter basket, this is just so much pretty scupture.UPDATE: You can get the filters from Breville USA, for a price. You can also use a backflush detergent (like JoeGlo) to clear them, although it's a bit time-consuming and messy."
1,bad machine/bad customer service,This machine started out great. I usually drink a cappuccino every Saturday morning. After about 30 cups (6 mo.) it began to have problems with the steam wand not producing steam but instead giving spurts of water. I started heating the milk in the microwave and not using the steam wand. After 60 cups of coffee it stopped heating enough to make espresso altogether. It was out of warranty at that point in the 13th month. Some of the machines have this same problem out of the box. Before you buy this machine go up to [...] and look at the reports from other owners. They told me this problem was my fault and I should expect the machine to have this part worn out and to replace it after 60 uses. So you should fully expect to need to repair it after 60 uses.
1,No Third Try for Me,"I have owned two of these Breville 800ESXL espresso makers. I liked the first one quite a bit, but it broke down - stopped heating the water - after a little more than a year. Since I liked the machine, and hoping I'd just been unlucky with the first one, I purchased a second one. It has now stopped heating water after 11 months. I make about three cups a day, and maybe this machine just isn't designed to last more than a year or so at that rate. But my preference is for something that lasts a quite a bit longer than that, particularly at the price of four of five hundred dollars for an esspresso maker. So I'll be looking elsewhere in the future."
5,Long time breville owner,"Okay, I finally had to say my peace on this espresso maker. IT MAKES GOOD STUFF! There I said it. I have had mine for 3 years. I don't use it daily, but when I do decide to make an Americano or a Latte it turns on and makes a great shot everytime!I have ordered a Lapavoni MP68 double shot basket that is not a double wall like the Breville. I get great crema with the pressurized portafilter basket, but I have read several reviews of the coffeegeeks who insist that having a different basket makes this machine as good as anything out there. We'll see.If you want a sexy machine that makes great espresso without a huge learning curve....this is it!Every thing made can fail, and I suspect the negative reviewers have had issues that formed thier opinion. It can happen to a $2000 machine as well. But out of the box and working as designed this thing ROCKS.The rest is up to you and the coffee gods.Buy it, try it....return it if it you don't like it."
5,This Machine is Fun!,"This machine is fun! This is my first espresso machine and I considered many others before I bought it. Other, more expensive machines may be as good or even better, but for under $400 I am very pleased! It is a solidly built and beautifully designed machine, and makes great coffee!"
1,Poor Got to starbucks...it's less expensive and thier coffee may last longer than this machine!,"Poor quality. Steamer sprays streams of hot water, and after just 3 1/2 months, the machines pump went out! DO NOT BUY this machine...You WILL be sorry! There are lots of good machines out there...don't waist your money on this one unless you want frustraction, and a big hole in your pocket! I was thinnking of using it as a paper weight..."
5,Extremely pleased,"I purchased the Breville 800ESXL Commercial machine and what a good choice I made. First, the item arrived at my home way before I expected it. Second, we opened up the box and found everything that was advertised with the product. We gave this product to our daughter as a Christmas gift and she loves it. It works great. I have no complaints at all with either the seller or the product."
1,an espresso that does not produce espresso,this coffee machine more suited for making ice tea than espresso. the muddy water it produced was alot colder than it should
2,It works..For a little While anyways..!,I have to say this product was excellent for ..a Little While..! It will stop working and then not even turn on.. I looked up info on the product after mine stopped working and found it had known issue and since then it has been reconfigured and redesigned.. buy the newest version and enjoy your espresso..!
2,Great espresso but steam wand dies within 2 years,You may want to check out the discussion at getsatisfaction regarding this issue. I now have an espresso maker that doesn't make steam. I will have to ship it out of state and pay a huge amount to get it fixed. And the machine is less than 3 years old. Find your nearest service center before buying!
5,Excellent!,"This product is all that it's cracked up to be. Some of the concerns expressed by others about problems with the filter and the lack of a so called ""dry puck""are easily avoided with proper handling. Make sure you use the right grind, and fill the filter up to the rim and press hard. With that your puck will be dry, and your filter won't clog. Also, the enhanced frothing attachment is unnecessary for the most part. I'm enjoying it everyday."
1,great until pump gave out!,"I LOVED this machine until the pump gave out. Hadn't been used that much, but warranty was up. No authorized service center in my area. MAILED machine to a authorized service center that Breville provided in a list they e-mailed me. Yep, spent the time and money to mail from PA to Illinois. After 3 months of me calling them (they don't call you) they still didn't have the part. I contacted Breville. Breville had the part sent to service center (because I intervened). I then sent an e-mail telling them the part would be there 8/17. After 10 days I called. The nasty customer service (hence the reason I started to e-mail) said ""the guy asked the guy why he didn't put it in yet, he doesn't know"" After two more frustrating calls I told them to throw it away I would just buy a new espresso machine. I notified Breville of the service center's conduct. No reply from Breville."
1,"Great until it fails, then NO REPAIR","After appoximately 1.5 years the pump stopped (out of warrenty) and can't get through to Customer Service (three call ave hold time before I hung up is 23 minutes). Talked to one of the Breville repair facilities and was told to get a new one, they couldn't (or wouldn't) repair it. NEVER BUY BREVILLE AGAIN!!!!!"
5,Used for 18 months,"I've used this daily for 18 months and I've never had the reservoir slide out onto the tray. In fact its never budged once it was slid in place.Coffee puck is sometimes wet, sometimes bone dry. I think it has to do with the grind of coffee I use. I don't think it affects the flavor one way or the other.Heating element creates hot coffee, and hot steamy milk. Coffee is too hot to drink and I like to let it set for a couple minutes.It took me a few months to figure out how to use it though, whether its how much pressure to use to tamp the coffee, what grind to use and what brands of coffee. I also was alittle slow on the uptake on frothing the milk to a fine bubbly foam.This is my daily coffee maker and I use the best beans I can afford and use a hand grinder to grind them. When I'm lazy I'll pull out the store ground coffee but either way, I get a very good coffee."
1,Good Coffee... Bad Machine,"The machine makes great coffee unfortunately, it breaks quickly and fixing it is VERY EXPENSIVE.Breville would not even talk to me, since the machine was out of warranty! Worst costumer service ever."
2,Water not hot enough,"For a $400 Expresso machine, this unit just doesn't produce water hot enough. I need to microwave it after brewing. Additionally it brews too fast while giving you the crema, resulting with coffee not deep and dark enough. For a expresso coffee purist, this unit is a disappointment."
2,Great cappuccino but manufacturing quality lacks,"I had 2 of these machines. It makes a respectable cup and is easy to use. I took great care of my machine. Filtered water, cleaned after every use. Mine just started smoking one day from inside the machine. I had it for about 3.5 years and it got ample use but for a $525 machine I'd expect it to last longer. I understand things are built to break to fuel our capitalist machine but come on. Do u think I'm going to replace this machine with another Breville?"
2,Breville 800ESXL,"Breville 800ESXL coffee espresso machine have a beautiful design, make good coffee, but make poor steam for coffee late lovers, add to much water into de milk, the same as Coffee Roma machine, just because do not have a boiler, also, it is difficult to read de water level, I have to remove the water deposit to see the water level."
2,thermoblock is questionable,"Had the 800esxl for 5 years - used it frequently, say 6 times a week. The espresso was fine, inconsistent heat, triple prime occasionally watered things down (3 stars for a $400 machine) - but the big problem came 5 years in when the thermoblock started leaking at the seams. There is no 'repair' for this - you have to replace it, and this is where my 2 stars come in - Breville does not make the parts for this machine any longer! Their customer service acknowledged this and had no explanation as to why - they did offer me 20% off a new unit (That's about retail at any Brick n Mortar store, woohoo, big deal). So, buyer beware Thermoblock is a questionable design in my opinion. I figured I would get more than 5 years out of a $400 appliance that basically spits out hot water - BTW I passed on a new Breville, um, forever."
2,"UNRELIABLE BRAND. I bought two, both broke within one year of use.","I like the design and the nice decorative look of this product. However, the first one I bought broke within one year of use. I liked in enough to buy a second one, mostly because it looked nice in my kitchen. The second one also broke within one year of use. Based on my experience and the fact that there are so many of this model being sold as refurbished, I'm convinced that this product and this brand is UNRELIABLE."
1,Too many problems!,This machine is messy. It drips water constantly into the pan below and has to be emptied often. The metal has started peeling off around the base exposing a very unattractive surface below and has caused me to cut myself on the exposed edges. The power switch recently went out on mine after only 3 years. I now have to unplug it to turn it off. It does not produce a quality crema the way my Saeco machine did. I will not buy Breville ever again.
5,Awesome espresso machine,"I recently got one of these off of [...] for 150 bucks, and I tell you what, this machine is amazing. What a steal! I also bought one of the lower end Brevilles for the office, and it worked good considering it was 200 normally, but this machine is way better, and I would definitely say it's worth the price. It makes a consistently great espresso, the build quality is good and sturdy, and if you grind the coffee properly you won't clog the filter. Too many reviewers blame the machines design, when in fact it's their user error that's causing the problems. This machine has a nice sleek design to it, and the light up buttons for the power and steam and hot water make the design that much more classy. Overall it's a great machine IMO. I highly recommend it, and I'm very glad I bought one."
4,"Great Book! Funny, Interesting, Relaxing...","I really love this book and I'm proud of myself, because I bought this. If you have seen the movie, this might be good for you to read. I mean, here is totally much more than in the movie. This is funny and fresh! If you're now thinking that should I buy this or not, then I say to you ""Do it!"""
3,He-loooo,"I am totally bugging. You must be clueless if you think this is the best book by H.B. Gilmore. Yeah, I guess it's worth the money, but the movie is like way better. Not to mention that you can get sick of the same material. So just browse through it at the bookstore to find that line you missed, then go to the video place and check it out! Perfect to cuddle with. So take my advice and check out the other Clueless books"
3,"Nice idea, didn't work for us","I am a homeschooling mother of three boys and I like a lot of the Kumon books. My youngest is ready to learn letter recognition, basic phonics, and writing letters so I purchased this for him. (He just turned 4) With my older boys I taught them to write the letter in the order of the alphabet. When I opened this book and saw their approach of teaching the simplest letters first and then continuing with letters grouped by the types of lines they contain I thought it was worth a try. For HIM this method is not working, but now that we have continued with our standard ABC order he is doing well. I believe he was having a hard time remembering what was what because all the letters were too similar to one another in appearance and motion. Another con is that the book does not provide enough practice for each letter; you only write each letter 3 times. On the positive side, like all Kumon books, this book is very colorful and sturdy."
5,Preschool Writing,"My daughter is 4, and just started preschool. She loves the workbook. It teaches her to make different lines before she started the letters,which helped her make them correctly. Great for beginners."
4,Needs more practice pages,"The letters are grouped by the type of strokes needed to master the letter. And the stroke practice pages prior to learning the actual letter are very helpful too. However, there are only 3 pages dedicated to learning the strokes and the child only practices an actual letter a total of 13 times throughout the whole book. It's hardly enough for a child to learn to write letters. The progression of learning the letters was logical, but the book lacked enough practice. After completing the whole book once, I went back with an eraser and cleared all the pages. Then made xerox copies of the letter practice pages. I had my son work through my xerox pages first and then went back through the book two more times. Once in pencil and once in a different colored pen, so that he could see his progression. I think KUMON could easily break this up into two books, one dedicated to letters with just straight lines, and one dedicated to letters containing curves and wavy lines."
3,Works but not best organization,"My 4 year old loves this book. We do ""mommy school"" for preschool and he enjoys using the Kumon books. I don't really care too much for the organization of this book and my 4 year old is a little confused as to why the alphabet isn't in order. They group the letters according to similar stroke patterns rather than in alphabetical order. Not too fond of that. We used the Kumon Tracing book prior to introducing him to this book. So he already had a basis of pencil control. I would recommend using that book first if your child does not have much experience with writing. My son does like the pictures and it does keep him wanting to do more so it works for us."
2,not much good about this movie,"The story/plot is about the only thing that is not terrible in the movie. The acting is downright lamentable. The editing is so bad, it would make a silent film producer from the 1930's blush. The audio track is just so horrible, I found myself wishing this was a silent film.All in all, there are much better entertainment choices for you to spend your budget on. Not one of Germany's better exports.Lastly, is not suitable for young children."
3,Would be perfect if it did not block the folder navigation button,"I would think this case is perfect were it not for one major flaw. The Zen Stone has a switch/button on the side that is used to place the stone in shufffle mode, regular play mode, or navigate to the next folder. When the stone is in it's case this button is completly inaccessible. If you want to navigate to a specific folder/album while the Zen Stone is in the case you must navigate one track at a time.The Zen Stone Keychain is packaged with both the case and a ring to attach it to. The rin is probably too large to be comfortable attached to a set of keys but is just the right size to use as a belt clip. The case secures the Zen Stone in place with a hook and loop (VELCRO) fastener and the case can't be opened with the ring is in place."
3,functional with adaptation,Does the job but had to make some more holes to use all the controls.Think it was a bit pricey too.
3,"Some good points, some bad points.","I think $13 is a little much to pay for something this small. That said, I do like that the USB and headphone ports are left uncovered by the case so that you can listen to, charge, or add files to the player without taking it out of the case. The ring is not all that much bigger than your average split key ring, and I've had no trouble with just keeping it on my keys and plugging it in to the cassette player adapter in my car.I have also found it annoying that you can't get at the folder skip button while the case is on, and that the LED indicator is hidden by the case, although this can be remedied with a hole punch and a little ingenuity. The key ring, I've found, can also be a bit rough on that little loop it goes through; the edges are starting to fray and I'll need to either repair it or replace it."
3,"Musicals fan from Hampshire, UK","Except for Kathryn Zaremba (as Annie), most of the singers are in great voice on this recording. Half the fun of this CD is comparing the musical numbers the original. For fans of Annie, it is a gem, but is not one you would listen to over and over."
1,Customer Service,"After using Webroot Window Washer for many years I have become a big fan. I have never had any problems with the software and it has always done a great job, until now.....I recently bought a new computer with windows Vista installed. The new version of Window Washer 6.5 supports Vista, so I bought the new version.The program installed fine and then after a recent update, the wash was taking 2 to 3 hours to complete (usually takes under 1 minute).I contacted Webroot via their online email support. I received a reply 2 days later which had nothing to do with my question and did not help at all. I contacted them again, but received THE SAME response - what a joke. Yesterday I received a survey to complete about my satisfaction, saying they are committed to having good customer relations. I gave them all 1's - what a surprise!!!This is a real shame, as they have great products, but don't have the support to back it up."
4,Silver Apples - 'Beacon Remixed' (Whirlybird),"Ten tracks of various artists like Sonic Boom(of Spacemen 3),Loop Guru,Him and Skylab doing the remix thing with songs from the Apple's 1997 comeback CD 'Beacon'(see my review).Strange factor about this collection of remixes,some of them actually sound as good,if not better than the originals.Check it out for yourself and see what I mean."
4,"An appetizer, hopefully.","So, anyone noticed Volvo using the Aluminum Tunes version of ""New Orthophony"" in their commercials? How about a song from ""Dots and Loops"" in a Volkwagen beetle commercial? Hmmmm....looks like Stereolab arent the staunch Marxists that we thought. I knew they were perfectly capable capitalists!! :-) Anyway, I am eagerly awaiting the new work from the Groop and enjoyed the huge sample of stuff on Aluminum Tunes. New Stereolab people, please buy ""Emperor Tomato Ketchup"" first. Aluminum is more for collectors. Aluminums' ""New Orthophony"", however, is probably the most beautiful song they've made."
4,Great warmer for cold seats,This cushion heats up nice and toasty. I'm starting my 2nd cold season with mine. Really helps on a cold day. I'm giving them as gifts to a few cold natured friends.
3,ok for 2 months.........,"As other reviews have stated, this unit is comfortable but not highest quality. Mine worked great for 2 months, then quit. I assume it is a burned filament. I would attempt to repair it, but it would be hard to find and would probably break again. On the plus side, it was great while it worked, and is comfortable to sit on even when not heated. Next one will be purchased locally so it can be returned if necessary."
4,Great Value!,"I would definitely recommend this heated seat cushion to all interested... I read some of the reviews but could not corroberate. The plug is on the correct side (when using it in the driver seat), heats up quickly, and is set at a comfortable setting. If you're looking for something good and inexpensive, this is the way to go. I haven't left it plugged in overnight (to see if it drains my battery) but this is one draw back everyone lists. Fortunately, the plug has a bright red indicator light - so it makes it easy to see when it's on."
1,Wagan IN2282 Black 12V Faux LeatherDeluxeHeated Seat Cushion,Wagan IN2282 Black 12V Faux LeatherDeluxeHeated Seat Cushion was not as confortable as others own! I live in mn so one of this was useful since own a car with out heated seats on leather! Its not permanent cushin
2,had to return,I actually returned this because it did not have an off on switch. I was afraid of forgetting to unplug it and walking out after work to a dead car
5,he loved it,I got this for my son. He hasn't had any heat in his car for a month or so and he has used this item and loves it. Keeps his legs and back nice and toasty and he wants another one for the passenger seat.
1,Junk,Bought this hoping it would at least last one winter. It only worked for about a month and then quit heating. Needless to say I am not a happy customer.
1,garbage!,"Sorry but this seat is garbage. Everything about it is cheap and flimsy, but worst of all it does not heat up!You get what you pay for - but learn from me, don't wast you $$$ on this one!"
2,Loved it for one week...,The heat seat cushion was great for the first 3 days and then stopped working. Very disappointed.
3,(none),"I purchased this online, and about a week later I received an e-mail saying I was getting a refund because they didn't have any on hand. They did give me enough time to order a different one somewhere else, but I was more unhappy with the fact I was able to order something I couldn't get."
5,Great Buy,Perfect for what I was looking for. Warms seat quickly as my heater on my very old vechicle does not get very hot. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.
3,"the heat does feel good,BUT","This product does one thing good,it gets warm within 2-3 minutes but that is it! The cushion is covered with a smooth material, and even with the elastic bands, moves all over the seat when you get into the car. The bands are very cheap and are not attached very well to the cushion. Within 2 weeks all the elastic bands that hold it place had broken. Wagen surely must be able to come up with a stronger and more dependable way to secure the cushion. Would not buy another one!"
4,its cheap and keeps my bumbum warm,shiping was fast it takes 2 or 3 minutes to warm up but it does im looking forward to a better winter ps i got back problems and the heat seems to do really good hope it helps some ones decision
2,Great while lasted,"This model was the third heated seat cushion I have purchased in three years. The first was a $20-$25 Wagan and lasted one full season. It did not work when I plugged it in at the start of season 2. Season 2 I purchased a $60 seat cover from another manufacturer, hoping that more cash = more life. It lasted almost one full season, but not quite. Season three was back to Wagan. Anticipating that it would not last, I purchased the cheapest Wagan model, the IN2282. In keeping with its model number, it lasted 2 months. This year will be season 4. I will purchase the Wagan IN9738-5 in the hopes that by returning to spending $25 I will have a warm Maine butt through spring."
3,good and bad,"I placed this unit in my 82 CJ7. The good is it heats nicely and does so a lot quicker than waiting for my Jeep to heat up on its own. The bad is it does not fit well in the seat, the hold down straps are pretty useless and all have already broken, the cushion is made from a slick material so it is difficult to keep in place. I think the best installation for this product would to be to place it under a seat cover."
4,"decent quality, good heat, durability may be an issue longer term","They heat well - but becasue there is only one setting, it gets hot, you have to plug and unplug it on long trips to modulate heat.They are not pretty, and I don't know if they will hold up for more than 1 winter season, but they are great to have on cold mornings."
1,It was great while it lasted,I purchased this for my husband for Christmas and it stopped working already! I don't think he even got a month of use out of it. Don't waste your money.
4,do not forget to unpug it!,"I have the seat for two weeks now. It works, it heats up in about a minute. Stays warm, not too hot, very comfortable. I can only strap it with the upper straps, and the lower straps do not seem as they can be used at all. I need to adjust the seat a little every time I use it.The main thing to remember is to unplug it when you finished driving! It stops heating after you turned off your car, but it still eats up the battery power! I learned it the hard way - had to call for help after the seat was left plugged in overnight. My new battery got completely empty."
2,Wagan Deluxe Heated Seat Cushion for Car,"It's alright. I wish it would heat up faster. However, even when it isn't heating at all, the material feels warmer to my bum on a cold morning than the actual car seat, so there's a plus. I hate how poorly it stays in place. It should have a rubberized or sticky backside so I wouldn't have to battle each time I get into the car to avoid it sliding over. Yes it has straps, but they are weak."
4,Great cushion!!,"Wagan Deluxe Heated Seat CushionI've had this item for approximately a month and so far it has functioned perfectly. Keeps my back and derriere nice and toasty on those cold PA mornings. I would have given it five stars if it had a high/low setting and a switch. If it gets too warm, you can't adjust it, you just have to pull the plug. It warms up quickly and overall I'm extremely happy with it."
4,Heated Seat Cushion,"I am very pleased with the heated seat cushion for my pickup that I purchased on Amazon. com. It keeps your tush amazingly warm in the cold climate up here in South Dakota. Before I leave for work in the moring, I start my pickup to warm it up and after a few minutes, my seat is warm and comfortable. If you have a warm seat to sit on, the rest of your body retains heat and you are pretty much warm all over. My wife and I both have them for our vehicles. Both cushions were purchased on Amazon.com. They are well worth the price. Thanks, Amazon.com!"
2,Brock down after 2 month,I got it about 2 month ago. It just stopped heating. I do not know if it is just my unit or it s general trend.
2,"good idea, don't last","WE needed it for daily use. Worked great a few times, thought it was great. Then stopped working. This is the third one we tried and same thing happened. never again!"
4,Pro: Gets warm and toasty. Con: No button control.,"This seat warmer really does keep my back warm and toasty in the winter. I have a bad back... and I'm on in my early thirties so it's kind of a bummer.My husband and I put this on the passenger side of our car fairly easily, it attaches via a stretchy strap across the back. There are some useless front straps that just hang and dangle, but they aren't necessary anyway (I should just cut them off). The seat warms up a minute after you insert the cigarette lighter power cord. The only negative is that you have to pull out the lighter cord if you want to turn it off. It would be nice to have a button. I always make sure to unhook the power source although I'm not sure if it would drain the battery if I didn't do that.This is really great for all those longer trips we take during the holidays."
5,Excellent!!,I got 2 of these a few weeks ago for my boyfriend because he did not have heated seats. We couldn't be more pleased. Our tushies are nice and toasty due to these seat cushions. They are very appreciated in the cold winter months. I recommend them fully.
1,Highly upset!,Was super excited about getting this and in Less than a month the item stopped working ! Super upset !!!!! :( definitely not worth it.
1,Kills your battery,This didn't fit my van very well and the elastic strap wouldn't fit around the seat to hold it in place so it was really uncomfortable to use. Also if you don't remember to unplug it you will drain your battery. I quit using it. It's not worth the headache.
5,warm again,"when i got a new car i couldn't afford to upgrade to heated leather seats, so go this as an alternative. Been warming my back and bottom every day for 2 months and love it!"
1,made in china,"elastic straps pulled out of the stitching, 2 places on the first day. Im holding it in place with bungi cords."
1,Stopped working,I bought this as a present for a friend and it worked great for about a week then it stopped working.
4,Wagon heated seat cushion,Product warms quickly and stays warm. The only draw back is that the cushion does not stay positioned on the seat. The straps do not provide stability to keep it in place.
4,A Real Charmer of a Film,This is the kind of film that reminds you of why you first fell in love with independent films. It's modest charm and the emphasis on characters keeps you interested and emotionally connected to the goings-on. The acting is quite good and the atmosphere really grows on you. If you ever had a hang-out that was your second home you'll really relate to this flick.
4,Works for my Sensitive Skin,"I have used this soap for over a year and have never experienced the burning or other problems listed by Essex. I have sensitive, dry skin and allergies. So far switching to this soap worked wonders for me. I know that Tom's of Maine was recently purchased by a major vendor (Colgate?). I hope they have not changes the formula."
2,NOT much Lather,"This soap is o.k, but there is NOT much lather and your skin feels kind of weird after taking a shower. Not tight but funny.I cannot explain you have to try it to understand what I mean."
1,Not for sensitive skin,"I would advise against this product for those with sensitive skin. I found it much too abrasive to be used as a body soap. It burns. I've been using it as a hand soap instead. They market the lather as being especially silky, but it's more appropriately described as ""sticky."" Enjoy. =)"
1,Disappointing Waste of Money,"This toy is so not fun. Any reviewer who said it is fun and exciting for children and adults is obviously an investor in the ridiculously overpriced and underperforming product. Like others have said, I was a sucker for forking out $50 for this sad waste of time. My 7 year old daughter and I were alternately bored and irritated trying to get the thing to react and respond in promised cute ways. My daughter wants to keep the baby - which equals $50 spent on a pom pom with googley eyes. The toy itself will be stuffed into a box bound for GoodWill for some other kid to be irritated with, and ultimately to languish in a landfill where its chemical-laden, non-bio-degradeable parts will rest for eons to come. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this toy."
1,Don't waste your money,"This ugly thing was the #1 item on my daughter's christmas list. I bought it. Christmas day comes, she opens it, it works for 5 minutes and stops working completely. Ok. Everyone is completely sold out. Everywhere. Three months later I finally find one...I drive an hour to exchange this ridiculous thing. So now we have a working one. It does nothing but stand up and wiggle it's arms, and make this annoying noise. Totally does not do what's on the commercial. She's played with it twice. My 3 year old even thinks it's dumb."
4,Fuzz Luv,"My daughter received this as a Christmas present about 4 years ago. She lost interest in it fast(she was 5 years old). She just rediscovered it in her toy box and loves it!! We keep it in an area where we can interact with it when we are passing by and find it funny when it responds to us. What I thought was a bust 4 years ago is a hit with my daughter now (9 years old). The toy shuts it's eyes and ""goes to sleep"" when it's dark and when we're not around. It's cool to see it start to talk and move it's body parts when we walk into the room. We find it funny that we're interacting with it as if it is a pet."
2,Fuzz Luvz,"My daughter received this as a gift and it was such a disappointment. It is really really loud and it doesn't grow like it was described. Also, the baby that was supposed to appear at a later date, was already loose in the box. She played with it for a couple of days, now it's on a shelf in her room."
3,Noise maker,"Thie was an absolutely adorable item. My Grand Daughters loved them. There were a couple of drawbacks though. First is the motor noise evertime the Fuzz Luv moves at all and the shedding of the fur. Hopefully the shedding will stop, hopefully before it gets bald spots."
4,nineteeneighties,"I loved these songs back in the '80's, and I love how Grant put his own take on them. Almost like if they are new all over again. People everywhere maybe at work or in the car always comment on the CD when I am playing it. They always want to know who is playing. It's definately one of the best CD's I purchased last year. Hope you enjoy too."
3,Not the right interpreter for these songs,"This album is not unpleasant. Grant Lee Phillips can be a great entertainer. I own his first two solo albums, and am quite happy with them.Grant has a very distinctive style of singing and some peculiar vocal affectations. His singing is as distinctive as Alanis Morrisette or Tom Waits. Once you know him, he is instantly recognizable. In his own songs, he seems to be able to make these quirks work for him. With this collection of cover songs, the result sounds slightly odd to me.Mostly the problem here is monotony. Nothing seems very lively. Grant sounds a little burned out. If these are tunes Grant really loved, he hasn't convinced me. Maybe with some inspired backing musicians and about ten cups of coffee, Grant could have laid into these songs and wrung something new and interesting from them. This may be pleasant music for relaxing, or background for doing household chores, but I'd really expect more from Grant Lee Phillips."
3,Grant Lee covers.,"This was a labor of love no doubt for Grant. I like this collection of covers both because he does a good job, and because it's about the same bands I listened to in my twenties also. I wouldn't say he makes any of these songs his own, but a solid job still.My only minor complaint is that a few of the cover choices seem too obvious. So many Cure songs to cover, yet he chose ""Boys Don't Cry"". Same with The Church and Psychedelic Furs hits. But on the bright side at least we don't have to hear versions of ""How Soon Is Now"" and ""Monkey Gone To Heaven"".If you like Grant, and you like what is now called ""classic alternative"", get it."
2,Owes a debt to Gregory Page,"While some might find this album amusing and a fresh creative direction for Grant Lee Phillips, I am not in that camp. This collection is amusing because it's clearly what Phillips came up with when thought, ""I wonder what these old 80 songs would sound like if they were performed by Gregory Page"". If you like the songs--then great--it's fun to hear them in a different light. But if you like the style, look up Gregory Page's work and be transformed to a world of characters and emotion that the mood on Phillips' record conveys."
1,That sweet baby smell is the smell of toxins,I was using this product for the 1st year of my daughter's life until I found out it wass rated 7/10 on EWG's health and beauty product toxicity rating. The fragrances in the product are made from toxic chemicals which are absorbed into your baby's body through the skin. I was upset and disappointed that a product used on newborn babies was this toxic! I don't use this junk anymore.
1,Awful,"This stuff is awful--don't use it. I assumed that because it was made for babies it would be safe to use. It completely dried out my three-month-old's skin and he got eczema. In addition, it smells really perfume-y, which for me is a turnoff. The pediatrician said not to use it."
5,great wheels..!!!!,"this dvd is a must have , if you have kids..!! it follows a letter from start to end..goes inside the POST OFFICE.."
4,"pretty, kindof small","I have ended up wearing these earrings quite a lot. They are quite pretty, small, understated but with a little sparkle that catches the light now and then. They go well with my marcasite choker. A nice, versatile pair of earrings. I think they are overpriced however, despite their good quality."
5,Brilliance!,She currently has 3 CDs out and I bought them all here on Amazon! Beautiful voice from a brilliant artist!
4,Burr becomes more than a blurr,"Too easily dismissed as a minor and miscreant figure of his times, Burr emerges in this true-to-character portrait and history by Vidal. Confirms and enlarges on the surprising flaws and figures of other early republic heroes, especially Jefferson."
4,A fascinating biography that made me laugh out loud,"First, I have to admit that I have not studied America's ""Founding Fathers"" so it is possible that some of what Vidal included in his book is controversial among historians. However, the book was a great read that helped me understand a bit of what was going on in our country during that time. Years ago I read ""Lies My Teacher Told Me"" about how American History is distorted when it is taught in our public schools. Since then I've been keeping an eye out for scholarly accurate but accessible books about the early republic. I'd definitely recommend this one. I'd give it 5 starts if it included a preface that stated what aspects were ""controversial"" among scholars. Whether you like Vidal or not, he is a great writer."
3,A fun but flawed counter-history,"If, as you read, you are constantly attuned to the self-serving nature of Burr's narrative, you'll find this work of historical fiction most amusing and illuminating. Reading Burr's view of early U.S. History, complete with an incompetent George Washington and a politically ruthless Thomas Jefferson, can remind you again never to settle for propaganda versions of history. But the novel's cyncical, scandal-happy tone becomes tiresome after a while"
4,History sans accountability,"I loved this book but alas, I am in the midst of writing a real work of history about the march to Quebec in 1775 that requires documentation of primary sources for any allegations made by the writer. Vidal avoids this tediousness, and I see why. He says as much in his afterward. As a satirical work of historical art this account has no peer and the detail of his research is self-evident, and I fully understand I'm writing about a legend in literature. As for the real story, I'm headed for the history section of the L.A. Public Library to read the ""Private Journal of Aaron Burr."" No offense, Mr. Vidal, but I need to hear from it from the ""horse's mouth."""
2,Not Worth The Effort!,Burr is a rambling book that leaves one hungry for more historical meat. Vidal forces you to wade through pages of overly clever prose to find even a scrap of the story of Burr's life. His device of using another lawyer (with his own set of intrigues) to tell the story is as uneccesary as it is frustrating.
2,Gore's Ego,"Instead of a ""wonderous"" book, this book is ""ponderous"". Gore is his usual sarcastic self. He is more interested in impressing the reader than providing useful information. I'm half way through and will stick with it. Perhaps it will get better, but I doubt it."
4,"Fascinating ""History""","Having been absorbed by the recent HBO mini-series, ""Adams,"" I wish HBO had considered Burr for the subject rather than Adams. A rousing carousing and inspired life, much maligned in modern parlance, Burr was everything that America has become. Rich, deceitful, inspired, brilliant, and devious. Yet, in the end, he was a lovable rogue. The flaw with the book is its ending, which seemed to have withered away until, of course, the ""surprise"" ending. Great historical fiction."
4,From Russia with an early Bond soundtrack,"This soundtrack is the first one John Barry made for the Bond films and that is probably why it sounds quite strange. There are some orchestral pieces but most of the time Barry keeps the music very simple, e.g. his approach for ""Spectre island"" or ""Gypsy camp"". Not you everyday 007 music, but still worth having, were it just for ""Girl fight"", ""Stalking"" and ""Bond with Bongos"". Fine cd."
3,starts strong,"The book draws you in, then doesn't seem to really go anywhere. Certain observations by Lisa are dead on, making the reader why things go wrong in other parts of her life. I've always struggled with the notion of not subscribing to a struture, of trying to shock people out of their supposed sleep-state by performing in clubs that someone else with more reason built. From the beginning you get the sense that all punks become assimilated in the end, but unlike the 'normal' people the 'punks' feel the need to lamely justify their own path towards normalcy. Let's rip it all down and then get some money from a structured, linear book! Decent read, but doesn't seem self-consistent for understandable reasons."
4,Drugs really are not so nice...,"This book is rad! It totally takes me back to being a teenage girl in the nineties. I may not have become mildly famous or birthed a skin head's baby but the rest i pretty much did do. I have often considered writing a story of my youth from that era and now I feel that I do not need to. It also made me go back and relearn some music.. underground stuff that I overlooked and now love. It also tamed my hatred of gg allin... i mean i still hate the guy, but not as much. over all it is worth a read. It is not profound or award winning material but it is entertaining and passes many bus rides."
4,I <3 Lisa Crystal Carver,"I recommend this book to anyone with an open mind. I cant say its for everyone, but as a fan of Roller Derby (her zine) from my college days (I have been out of college for 12 years) and reading her articles in major magazines now and then, I love Lisa and her crew. its a good glimpse into the life of someone who has made her own niche in the world, who is talented and interesting. The title may be off putting for some, but I still recommend this read"
1,terrible,did not improve life of computer without plug in cord. product did not deliver guaranteed number of hours. still have to have laptop plugged in b/c battery does not work.
3,Nice mids and highs but not a lot of bass,Easily driven by factory radio or amp. Highs and Mids are way better then factory. However bass is just not there. Not nearly enough for my taste. Factory speakers produced significantly more. They are probably designed with a sub in mind which I do not think is the right approach. Nice stereo system should not need any subs. Just my opinion.
2,An honest effort.,"This video is definitely a product of its time. Compared to today's works, it's very dated and simplified. The shining star in it, however, is Richard Kiley as Peter. He does, as usual, a thoroughly heartfelt job in his portrayal of Peter. For his fans, it's well worth seeing. It would also be a good addition to church libraries. Don't expect too much and you can enjoy it for the honest and sincere production that it is."
2,Paris Bistro Content,"I bought this book because of the section on Paris. I was very disappointed in the book because it was of little help. There is no map shown of where the bistros might be so there was no way of knowing where any were. The list of addresses didn't really help as Paris, unlike New York, is not laid out on a grid and the addresses actually give an idea of the location. Also, most of the bistros were the higher priced ones."
1,Stopped at page 3,"This study guide is horrible. Take a look at page 1, there is a blatant mistake that anyone with 5 minutes of Probability training could pick out and it doesn't get much better from there. The solutions are shallow and do not provide adequate explanation. Most of the questions are general probability questions found in any textbook and are not representative of what would be found on Exam P."
2,Much better guides are available!,"I passed this exam February 2006, preparing using only this study guide. I passed because the material was quite easy, not because of this manual. I found that I had vastly overprepared, and some of the later material in this text is actually on exam 3. I've certainly forgotten it all by now, so I haven't really gained anything by all the extra studying and stress I put into the first exam. I highly recommend any other study guide (Actex, ASM, etc.) over this one. No reputable actuarial bookseller (Slide Rule Books, Actuarial Bookstore, Actex Mad River, etc.) sells this manual; there is a reason!"
2,Test Prep Guide Review,The solutions to each of the test questions were more often than not difficult to follow and difficult to comprehend. In some cases the solutions appeared incomplete.
5,A Classic. Enduringly Outstanding Listen,"Quite a fluke that I ever heard this Album...I'd never even heard of Guillemots... Then when Fyfe Dangerfield released ""She needs me"" from Fly Yellow Moon in January 2010 I was bowled over as soon as i heard it on the radio and so my musical odyssey began. The tracks on Through the WindowPane are everything and more that everybody else has said but that was 2006 and it is late 2011 now and they are still original, still beautiful, still mesmerising and well worth buying and listening to. I can't recommend this album too highly. It endures the test of time and is seriously classy magic."
5,it's all in the arrangements,"This album is beautifully arranged and in this day and age of slap-dash releases this is a cohesive, studied work of art. An absolutely gorgeous collection of beyond-pop songs. They stretch the concept of the pop song into territories not touched since Jeff Buckley left this world... with maybe a nod to Rufus Wainwright (sans pomp). It is NOT a rock record. It is string-laden singer-songwriter magic that would make a 60's Scott Walker proud and a 30th Century Scott Walker prick up his ears. really really special."
4,Carl 12210 Heavy duty trimmer,"Like the cutter overall. Much better than the Fiscars cutter it replaced. The paper stop could be a little more secure. It should extend across the cutting surface and be able to anchor on both ends so that it stays straight on multiple cuts. That is the only complaint, otherwise an excellent cutter."
4,"As expected from Amazon reviews, it meets my expectations","The pejorative criticisms concering the magnetic adjustable stop allayed any potential disappointment with this feature. I can live without that functionality, for now, but can see how others would not be able to to. The rest of this tool is quite well thought through. The numerous markings, clamp down feature, sturdy rail, etc. In particular, I would point out that the yellow plastic cutting guide is quite useful in positioning the edge of materials to be cut. It is spot on accurate and very precise. Any material that I have aligned and clamped down with the right edge of that guide got cut exactly along the edge of that guide. The yellow color and transparancy I found to be quite helpful in using this. I believe this is a new feature added to the older design."
1,don't waste your money,"This book contains numerous typos. A mistake which, from the, start, erodes credibility. It is often ambigous about wound care techniques. For example, it states that ""they"" don't use irrigation guns. But it doesn't tell the reader whether anyone else does. This book was written by a surgical technologist and paramedic from George Washington Medical Center. They always make reference to what they do at their facility. I think an author with an adequate width and depth of experience would not write from this perspective. The book was co-authored by a paramedic...According to a description of the book, there should have been several different BASIC suturing techiques. They barely cover or adequately explain simple interrupted and vertical/horizontal mattress. This book, in short, just don't cut the mustard. Save your money!"
4,4 1/2 Star Toothpaste!,"Tom's of Maine makes great natural products. I personally started using Silly Strawberry when I was ...three? Something like that. As an almost-ten-year-old, I appreciate the odd yet good taste (takes some getting used to!) As an animal lover, I appreciate the lack of animal byproducts. (In this case, lack is a good thing!) And as a girl with slightly yellow teeth, I appreciate great toothpaste that makes brushing good.I highly reccommend."
2,Rather disappointing,"I'm sorry to say that this book turned out to be a disappointment to me. I am an associate pastor at a small church, and I am called upon about once a month to deliver the sermon during the main Sunday worship. A compelling story or vivid illustration can change a dull and forgetable sermon into a discourse that can touch a person's soul and change a life, and I was hoping to find such stories in this book.Unfortunately, most of the stories found here seem rather meaningless or dull, and they often have only a weak connection to the point they are intended to illustrate. In about two years owning this book, I have only used an illustration from it twice. It seems like a waste of money.I'm sure there are some good books of illustrations out there. This isn't one of them."
4,Glass is really good!,"Great music! Nice playing - great interpretation, but the orchestra could be better... And the sound is somehow... strange. But I like this CD very much. And I am now checking about the conductor - this is the one of the few recordings I have already with him and I have to say- for me he is the new star in the classical music!"
4,What you see is what you get....,"Ordered this necklace to replace the one I have worn for over 40 years that finally came apart. This one is exactly like the photograph shown with the item, on one side is a medic alert symbol using a raised piece of painted metal that is riveted to the base and on the other side is the stamped lettering for the penicillin allergy. I can't tell you how long it will last since I've only had for a week, but assuming the rivets used to mount the medic alert symbol hold, it should last me the rest of my life :)"
5,I had the great fortune,"to study with Keith at the University of Calgary and to work with him at the Loose Moose Theater, and it had a tremendous impact on my life. His approach to education, to theater, to life all has a very liberating effect. This book carries a great deal of his spirit. It plants a terrific garden in your mind; some of the seeds sprout quickly while others may take a very long time to grow. This is a great book, for more reasons than I can say."
4,Remember the Audience,"There are many books about performing improvisational comedy. The most important lesson I took away from Johnstone's work is to remember the audience. Improv is a performance art, and by definition that requires that you perform for the audience. Too often, to me, improvisors look to please themselves in isolation. Pleasing yourself is great, but not at the expense of the audience. Johnstone helped teach me this."
1,Not Age Appropriate!,"Appears to be a very cute little book - perfect for my two year old granddaughter to hold and read. Nicely illustrated life of a lion, until you reach the part about hunting together and eating together, complete with bloody chunks of Zebra. I feel this is way too graphic for a preschool book as there is no way a young child would be able to grasp this concept.Laura Scott"
2,Does not use speedy rotary cutting techniques,"This book uses templates and it doesn't have a cross-reference for the shape and it's size. There are templates for squares even - I want to know what size they are. I have measured them and written the size on the template page so I can just rotary cut my squares and not use the template. A cross-reference should of been included in the book. I think this book is written for quilting techniques of years ago. It would of been a nice book back then, but not now. I should of returned this book."
4,"NOT for ""machine quilters""","This book is NOT for speed demons or ""machine quilters"" who are into quilting for PRODUCTION work ... this is a book that teaches TECHNIQUE ... the old fashioned way ... by hand ... for FAMILY & FRIENDS or For YOURSELF ... cut it out By HAND ... measure everything twice ... cut it once ... When you are done you have an HEIRLOOM not another one just to SELL ..."
2,Not my taste,"I bought this CD based on reviews of it on the Amazon site. It is OK. That's it. Not one that I think I would even consider playing again. In fact, I think I might give it to a CD resale store. Taste in music is a very individual thing; however, so this CD may appeal to others much more than it does to me."
5,Enjoy.. Dance.. Listen..,It's fantastic to find good musicians with good singers and good lyrics in New Latin fusion music... This is a very good C.D. for the heart... it has great music to enjoy the moment and take a little dance when you are alone and when you are with company too... I hope to have some notices from the band and tours....
1,Poor quality control,"Book arrived with missing chapters. Unfortunate in any case, but, unforgivable when the words""missing last chapter"" are written inside the front cover"
3,NOT BAD...NOT GREAT...,"This is a mildly suspenseful, atmospheric novel about a young, war widow, Kate Herrick, who in 1947 at the request of her ill grandmother in Scotland goes to Rose Cottage, her childhood home in the English countryside. Kate is to retrieve some of her grandmother's documents and personal belongings. When she gets there, however, she discovers that she is too late. Someone has been there before her.As Kate investigates the mysterious disappearance of her grandmother's property, she ends up discovering somethings about her own past. Well written and redolent of a bygone era, the book unravels a pleasant, uncomplicated story. Never too mysterious and not one of the author's best efforts, the book is a predictable, though somewhat enjoyable, read."
2,disappointing plot,"I loved Mary Stewart's books during high school and college. Recently I reread her ""Nine Coaches Waiting"" and it gave me the same thrill as before. But ""Rose Cottage"" was not up to her ususual standard. It didn't have the same sense of suspense and romance that her earlier books did. It started out suspensefully, but it never managed to sustain that mood. The ending was very much of a let-down because I had anticipated more mystery and there wasn't much of it. I also think it needed more of a drawn-out plot."
3,Comfortable,"Her earlier books were better. This one was still good and what I would consider comfortable. I don't think I'll be reading this one as many times as I have read her earlier books such as The Moonspinners, My Brother Michael, and Airs Above the Ground. It's still a good one to buy and keep with your Mary Stewart collection."

5,Good Light Reading,I enjoy Mary Stewart very much. Her 3 stories about Merlin are wonderful. Rose Cottage is a good light read.
3,Mixed emotions,"After the truly awful ""The Prince and the Pilgrim"" I really hesitated to read this one as I felt Mary Stewart was past her prime and had lost it. This book, however, is a mixed blessing.It starts out well, much in the manner of her earlier suspense novels which I much admired and enjoyed (and still do, I re-read them regularly even now, 30 years since I first read one). However about 2/3 of the way through the books it peters out to a very mundane ending.I would rate the book 4 stars for the beginning and 1-2 stars for the ending, so gave it 3 overall as an average."
5,Absolutely lovely,"I was engrossed from Chapter 1. It wasn't as dangerously dramatic or violently romantic as her other books (all of which I've enjoyed, so far), but it had drama, it was romantic. The story was beautifully written, realistically conveyed; the plot gracefully woven, not cluttered. All the things we seem to need in our books and films these days, romance, scandal, suspense, deceit, death... were there, and in their place, not exploded to overwhelming proportions. I recognised some of the people she described, most of us have known similar, in our own spheres. Sometimes you want a comfortable read, but nothing too dull... and this is the book for it."
3,"Entertaining, but not up to Mary Stewart's earlier standard.","Rose Cottage is the story of a young widow's quest for information about her family and very origins. Kate, a war widow, returns to her childhood home, Rose Cottage, to obtain her ill grandmother's treasures,including papers that may hold a clue to Kate's own history. The storyhas the earmarks of a Mary Stewart read, but is lacking the richnessof the author's early books, such as Nine Coaches Waiting, and MadameWill You Talk?. The novel doesn't refer to early English literature likeher previous books do, and the characters aren't as well developed. However,as an avid Mary Stewart fan, I would never say ""no"" to an afternoon withMary Stewart!"
2,Boring,I found this book to be very boring. There were a lot of long details that made the book drag and which didn't seem to be necessary. Not at all like the rest of her books I have read.
3,Pleasant but predictable ending,This book wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. I didn't like the predictable ending. A nice slow read.
3,Great Story,"I have not read a Mary Stewart book in quite awhile. It was worth reading. Her writing is a little slow I think, but good story line."
3,Pleasant but lacking Stewart's usual mystery and suspense.,"A quaint story of a young widow who uncovers the secrets of her childood past by helping her ailing grandmother recover mementos hidden in a cottage they had once lived in for many years. While engaging, it was predictable and offered none of the ususal suspense or true romance found in the early Stewart novels which so captivated me as a young girl."
2,This book was not up to Mary Stwewart's usual quality.,"I was so disappointed in this book. While her books are not meant to be profound reads, I've really enjoyed her gift for description, quotes from classic literature, the depth of her characters and how she develops the suspense/romance in the story. This book had only glimpses of Ms. Stewart's wonderful story-telling ability, as was found in some of her previous books including My Brother Michael, The Ivy Tree, This Rough Magic, etc."
2,Sweet but tame,"I used to be addicted to Mary Stewart's suspense/romance novels (Nine Coaches Waiting, Madam Will you Talk?, My Brother Michael, etc.) back in high school, but I hadn't read one in years. I picked this one up hoping to recapture some of that naive thrill; I was rather disappointed. It was not at all the kind of page-turner I remember reading and rereading and rereading until I had many of the passages memorized. I'm rather perplexed as to why she bothered to write it; it felt more like a prologue than an entire novel."
1,A Cure For Insomnia,"I love almost anything written by Mary Stewart, but this novel was a disappointment. It served a purpose, though, putting me to sleep night after night for a week until I acknowledged that I was bored to smithereens with it and chucked it across the room."
4,Descriptive and pleasant,"I found this book to be a very pleasant read for a lazy afternoon. The book does not move along at a fast clip, so if you expect that, then this might not be for you. If, however, you are looking for a good book with a lot of wonderful descriptions that is both light and entertaining, this would be a great choice. I liked the main character a lot and found it was really easy to identify with her. This author has such a good grasp on how to build a back story for her characters and make them feel real. I really liked this book."
4,A Gentle Read,"This is a sweet and gentle tale that makes for a satisfying read. There is just enough conflict, angst, mystery and love to keep the reader engrossed without causing any wrenching of emotions. It was a satisfying glimpse into posst war England in a charming and bucolic setting. I finished the book with a comforting sense of a pleasant resolution."
5,Fantastic Book,"I teach 5th grade and have used many of the lessons in the book. I like how they have a sheet I can use if I need it. Many times I put it on the overhead and use that way. I have seen a definate improvement in my students writing. I shared it in a writing class I am taking and many teachers ordered it, they were so impressed."
2,25 mini lesson plans gd.3-6,Book seems to be what I was looking for to send to my son who is teaching in South Korea.The lesson plans were easy to adjust to the kids and the adult programs.
5,Let Muddy put his brand on you,"This was the first Muddy Waters disc I purchased, and it remains one of my favorite blues albums by any artist. There is not a weakness in it to be found, including the excellent supporting cast, which includes Cotton on harmonica and Spann on piano. It's unfortunate that ""Catfish Blues"", which opened the set, was excluded from this disc for some reason. Sound is very good, which is not always a given when dealing with live performances, even today."
4,Great live Muddy.,"Recorded at the 1960 Newport jazz festival, this album is a superior set of live blues. Muddy is backed for the set by James Cotton on harmonica, the great Otis Spann on piano, Pat Hare on rhythm guitar, bassist Andrew Stevenson, and drummer Francis Clay. The performances are straightahead Delta favored Chicago blues highlighted by an explosive take and reprise of Muddy's set closer ""I've Got My Mojo Working"". From the sounds of the crowd Muddy nearly brought the house down before he wrapped up his set. This is a good live disc of exciting high energy blues by one of the music's masters, recommended."
5,Defining the blues,"This is one of blue's seminal albums -- a must-have for any blues fan. Simply put, it defined the Chicago style. Muddy's vocals are sensational -- he's in top form here -- and the band steams along like a locomotive. Don't expect high-quality sound, though. This 41-year old gem was recorded live and the sound gets pretty thin at times. No matter. It's the historic performance that you get."
5,Great for Beginners and Intermediates,"If you are looking to expand the sound of your kit then look no further. For the price this is an amazing bargain. My playing rarely requires a splash but it sounds good. I use the china more often and it is simply the heartiest cymbal I own. I beat the ever-loving crap out of it, and it still takes a licking and keeps on ticking.Overall the title is accurate."
5,Person of Interest - one of the best shows I have ever seen!,The premesis of this program is so close to what is really possible with today's technollogy that its scary! Sub-plots are dascinating and well thought out. Yiu need to see this from its first episode.
5,Perfect,"This is a must have for any fan of the series. If you're on the fence about buying this, I strongly suggest that you make the purchase."
5,Top,"Acheté par hasard , j'ai beaucoup apprécié cette série et les personalités originales des principaux interprètes, je suis curieux de voir si la seconde saison sera autant digne d'intèrt!!!"
5,Person of Interest,"Despite the fighting and shooting, this is a great series. I guess the reason is that they are saving lives."
4,Great purchase.,"As ordered, items arrived on time and there were no issues with any of the discs upon opening and playing."
5,Awesome!,"I received the product in good timing, in great shape. I am thoroughly enjoying watching my favorite show everyday. I can hardly wait until I can buy the next season."
5,Amazing,LOVE this show!!! It's amazing and gripping and both Jim Caviezel and Michael Emerson are masterful at what they do.
5,Mr. Reese and Mr. Finch just like Batman and Robin,"Mr. Reese is a former CIA operative that just wants to die and Mr. Finch is a genius with a problem. They reluctantly team up in order to save those about to die and stop crimes from happening. They have to dodge the police, FBI, rogue hackers, and the CIA. The first season sets up the players and the directing is top notch. Lots of guns, action and mystery."
5,"Awesome Cast, Great effects-like a 30min movie every wk!","Love Taraji P. Henson as the 'bad guy' wonderful casting selection CBS! Caviezel as lead male was stroke of genius! Love this show! Bought a new laptop just so i could watch it (cut cable when i switched 2 Prime on my ROKU). The effects, writing AND direction are great. I look forward to each & every epi!! Only one problem CBS, just like with the Mentalist you're not making the episodes available thru Amzn??? I check Amzn EVERY week from my iPad, laptop, and ROKU for these episodes - this show has definitely got a loyal fan following in me & most of my friends (who have now become hooked on this show after i told them how good it was)!!! Cmon CBS & AMZN let's get it together & put it on PRIME!"
5,Person of Interest Rocks!,"The Person of Interest series has me hooked hard. I LOVE everything about it. The acting is supreme, the timing of the subtle jokes just right, and the action is powerful but not bloody. I could watch this all day and all night. I had to pace myself, watching the First Season DVD, as each episode was a huge treat, like a hot fudge Sunday. I was bummed to the core when they had a rerun on the third week of Season Two, instead of a new episode."
5,AWESOME!,"What a great storyline. Part soap opera, part comic book, and just all fun. The quality of the Blu-Ray was superb on my HDTV, and I thought the DVD's were formatted very well for ease of use. Great entertainment value!"
2,awsome/ but has some technial problems,Great show never bored..... Can't wait to see the next episode.... One thing I don't like is that a lot of the 1St season is not available..... Why?
1,Person of Interest,"Did not like this TV show at all, boring...did not even finish watching it and will just give it away.Person of Interest: Season One [Blu-ray]"
4,Excellent acting,"Person of Interest is a wonderful show. The acting is superb and that extends to all of the guest actors, as well. The show has slick editing and is overall, well put together. I recommend it."
5,This show is GREAT!,I very much enjoy this show. The actors are very good. Theirfriendship has grown to the point where they both care foreach other and understand they need each other to survive!
5,Please add Chinese subtitle in Blu-ray version!!!,"I am a big fan of this show in Taiwan.It's definitely the most popular show from 2011 to 2012.There are a lot of fans in Taiwan.I want to buy ""Person Of Interest"" season1 blu-ray to support this show.But there's no Chinese subtitle on product details.However,DVD version have Chinese subtitle.So,please please add Chinese subtitle in Blu-ray version.I will be very thankful."
5,Can't Wait for Season 2,"This is a great TV series. My preference in movies is action, mystery and good dramas. I think it is well done and the story line in so believable."
5,"Love, love, love this show!!",We love this T.V. show. However we missed some of the shows in the first season. So happy the first season has been released.
5,person of interest season one,i like this show very much.it is very interesting to watch can't wait to order season 2 hopeit last for a few years
5,Person of Interest Series...,"I really enjoy this series although I was quite disappointed they included a same sex ""marriage"" in one episode (the most recent broadcast). Frankly I changed channels with that one. That one episode aside, I have really enjoyed the series as a whole. It is tense enough that you wonder what is happening next, but yet at the same time the good guy wins, so the show ends on a high note. I noted that they have even brought a Jag into the show in a recent eppisode. Reminds me of the ""Equalizer"" series I enjoyed as well. Thanks to the producers for including that make as a cameo. Off to ""My Cart"" for season one."
1,Not available,"I love ginger so I wanted to try this. But Vitamin Shoppe, after two e-mails, cancels my order which is not surprising as Tom's has, I understand, stopped making this flavor.I think it should be removed from the VS Amazon store post haste."
4,Burst of Freshness,"Like most baking soda toothpastes, the flavorlessness takes you by surprise at first. Then you realize that your mouth feels WONDERFUL as you're brushing--you get a burst of incredible freshness. I mean, how can you go wrong with ginger AND mint? I might add that this is a great morning toothpaste, if you're weird like me and use a different toothpaste in the morning than you do at night."
4,Yummy,"Most toothpastes are too, too minty for me and burn my tongue. This is a lovely delicate mint and ginger flavor. I don't like too much ginger flavor either, but this toothpaste has just enough. It makes my teeth feel squeaky clean. It only loses out on 5 stars because the fresh delicate smell doesn't last as long as I'd like it to after brushing. This is also the hardest toothpaste from Tom's for me to find locally."
2,I didn't care for the flavor of this ...,"I didn't care for the flavor of this particular kind of Tom's of Maine toothpaste. The gingermint wasn't particularly appealing to me. The toothpaste seemed to clean my teeth well and leave me with fresh breath, but I couldn't get past the odd taste of the gingermint. I wouldn't purchase this product, but maybe others would like it."
3,Unlike most baking soda toothpastes this one is ...,"Unlike most baking soda toothpastes this one is smooth with no gritty taste. It did take a while to get use to the taste -- I wasn't sure at first whether I liked it or not. But after using it a few times, I started to like it. This may sound weird, but it tastes the way it actually smells. I've never really """"tasted a smell"""" quite as pronounced as this!! I would use it again and recommend it."
1,"It was, without a doubt, one of the ...","It was, without a doubt, one of the worst-tasting toothpastes that I've ever tasted. I really wanted to like it because I believe in Tom's products, but I will never buy his toothpaste. However, I know that I don't like the taste of baking soda. If you do, you may feel differently about this product."
3,Still waiting for my order,"Ordered this prodcut on Feb 7th 2008 and three weeks later i'm still waiting. I love Tom's of Maine products, such a shame i picked a retailer who diesn't know the meaning of customer service, the Vitamin Shoppe"
1,Picture book of common tools,If you like looking at pictures and descriptions of common wood and metal working tools this book is for you...otherwise useless.
1,USed,"This chandelier came in a torn, taped box. Looks like it has been used and the parts were wrapped back and the whole thing returned. When I am ordering a new item from AMAZON, I expect it to be NEW and UNUSED. Too bad I didn't take into consideration the other review that said theirs was used too. Very unsatisfied and this is definitely going back!"
4,Globe Chandelier,"I ordered it Sunday and it was here on Thursday. It is hanging in my kitchen and looks great. The instructions were not clear but after many ups and downs on the 6 ft ladder, it is hung. My problem is the A 15, 60 watt bulbs it requires. I ran to the store and the only A 15 bulb is an appliance bulb, is that right? Is that what I need? I bought clear 60 watt bulbs and put them in and then saw the warining to use only 'A 15 60 watt' bulbs. I have looked all over the internet and can't find them.I am happy with the new light, my kitchen has never been so bright. I am getting new uba tuba granite counter tops soon and will need the bright light.Fast service, great price and a beautiful fixture. Thanks"
4,Very Stylish,"I bought this to replace a worn out brass chandelier that only had two lights that would work anymore. What an improvement! Adds a lot of light to a dim room, and looks beautiful. There were some swear words thrown around upon installation, but not a huge deal. One of the globes was slightly cracked upon arrival, but I just turned that part towards the wall where no one can see. My husband wasn't thrilled with some of the screws on top where it gathered...it kept slipping apart, but we eventually got it to stay, and so far, so good! A vast improvement!!"
3,could have been much better,Wish this was easier to listen to. I just found that his interpretation of the music to be distracting and difficult to enjoy.
2,"Don't buy it, waste of money","First of all, I couldn't even get this game to work properly. I have a high end system with a $400 video card and this game lags!! I can play Doom 3 on high settings but not a Tony Hawk game?Secondly, this game is way too easy even on the sick difficulty. Half the game was spent earning basic abilities like Manual and Spine Transfer and the rest of the time was spent trying to impress the local bums who give YOU money to do such simple things as Kickflips and 2000 point combos! Every once in a while you'll get a real mission to do but it usually something very simple and last all but 30 seconds. This whole game is beatable in two hours if you skip all the side missions and just do the main goals.Thirdly, classic mode is incredibly weak. There's only 6 levels! Beat that in one hour as well.In conclusion: If you must purchase this game buy a used copy. Get it for the PS2 or XBOX instead of PC because this one blows."
4,Great Game,"This game was extremely fun both story and classic modes. Although it was pretty short if you go through and take your time in the game it will be a great experience. The online was a great feature and It is still very active today, according to xfire an average of 132 players per day. I played it on Windows Seven Home yes it works, but it is a bit laggy."
4,Get it while you can!,"These Airliners are becoming harder to find as they are discontinued, so get one while you can. Overall I am happy with the purchase but I would like to add some constructive criticism. I wish the company would stick with UPS or USPS but not both. Basically they ship it UPS who in turns hands it over to the US Postal Service. From the day it shipped to arrival was eight days and that did not include the three days waiting for it to ship. Beyond that all was good to go!"
5,Beware translators!,"Well, I put five stars to this item because it is one of the most fabulous and complex novels ever written, at least for me (I read and re-read it in the original German). BUT : Everyone intending to read it in English should choose the Oxford Classics edition rather than this one. This old translation in Penguin clearly betrays the author's intentions, it becomes clear in the very first sentence, and there's nothing left in it of Goethe's subtlety."
3,3++ stars,"While not as bracing as their startlingly good comeback album ""Three Sisters,"" the Donut stretches out a bit more on this offering, serving up a slew of solid songs that recall their adventuresome glory days. Unlike ""Three Sisters,"" ""Fuzz"" drags at points, but not many -- and the trade-off is that there is greater instrumental interplay and some lovely harmonies. If you're a fan you're sure to want to keep supporting Alice Donut in their new, revitalized incarnation by purchasing this disc!Newbies might want to check ""Three Sisters,"" ""Untidy Suicides...,"" or even something from their back catalog like ""Bucketfuls of Sickness and Horror in an Otherwise Meaningless Life"" rather than this one -- but if you like what you hear you'll eventually want ""Fuzz"" too."
1,A big goddamn No!! (and I tried!),There is NOT ONE SINGLE good song on this album!I do not know how it is possible to say this album is any good -and I tried!!! I listened to it so many times and sadly came to the realization that ALL the songs sucked and there is NOTHING to salvage from it...I got rid of tthis album at the Goodwill store.What the hell were they thinking and what idiot could like this album? I will never comprehend!
2,Too too too DARK !!!,"Did the producers actually sit and watch this movie before they released it ? I am a die-hard Aliens/Predator fan but I had to stop half way through the dvd because it is sooo dark I could hardly make anything out, and my eyes were starting to strain. The story may be ok, but whats the point if you can't see anything ? Stupid, stupid, stupid. I could not enjoy it straining myself to understand what was going on, and from what I see on these reveiws I'm not alone. Not worth buying until they release a digitaly 'enlightened' version."
4,An Underrated Improvement over AVP,"I'm going to disagree with most reviewers here. AVP2 was a huge improvement over the (ridiculous) AVP. I thought the action scenes were top notch and acting was respectable. Overall, AVP2 was fairly realistic in depicting what (and how) a real town might react to an alien infestation, as well as, the Government response. The overall formula can be found in several recent movies, especially ""The Crazies"". Such realism made it brutal at times--almost no one is spared. In particular, this movie has some scenes of young children (even babies) being horribly killed. I'm sure these disturbing images drove some of the low ratings. It also seemed like there were a few scenes were very similar to those in ""Aliens"" (like the National Guard unit getting waxed). I agree with many people that the scenes were darker than necessary. If this was intentional, it only succeeded in annoying the viewer."
1,AVPR review part 2 part 1 on AVPR widescreen DVD reviews 2/10 review revised on 01/13/10,"This is part 2. You would've thought that 20th century FOX would've learned don't hire music video directors & they give the Strause Brothers full reign but were strict on Fincher WTF. Fincher has made some movies I actually liked Strause Brothers gave us R Kelly & 50 cent music videos WTF. I like Alien, Aliens & Alien 3 they were excellent Alien Resurrection was an ok action movie. Predator 1 classic survival horror Predator 2 comes pretty close. These movies shouldn't be that hard to make You have a planet overran by Aliens a space crew like the 1st movie gets a distress signal & they respond another ship with Predators responds to it too or do the same thing just have Predators result 1st then some marines go in 2nd. FOX you should've adapted Peter Briggs's script. Stay the f**K away from AvP & AVPR they have B list written all over it."
1,AvP Requiem,"Good Story, But BAD - BAD, and I do mean BAD Lighting! I Love the Alien series, but this... I admit that much of the films story happens at night, but even with my LCD AND computer, much of the detail is washed out. Very disapointing film released by 20th Centry Fox. Sadly, it won't be apart of my collection, because you just can't see whats happening. Note: I did try a ""second"" disk with the same results. Hopefully, in the future it will be re-mastered."
4,"Digital Copy (stars are for the copy feature, not the movie)","I just wanted to mention, in case FOX reps ever look through customer sites as they evaluate the success of their DVD products, that the Digital Copy feature of AVP:R is fantastic! As a guy who drank the Cool Aid for Apple's APPLE TV product, the convenience of importing a digital file into iTunes, then watching it via APPLE TV is great. (Yes, there are other ways to accomplish this, but this works without illegal decryption, extra software, and hours of encoding.)For myself, I like having the DVD to provide me with the best possible picture when I want it (when watching it on the bigscreen), or to use to view the special features not available via downloaded movies, but the ability to import a version to my APPLE TV so that I can call it up whenever I want, without having to find the DVD, makes the sale. Thank you!"
3,Stream not good,I enjoyed the movie but the streaming was not good. It would stop an I had to restart many times.
1,Awful,This movie was so terrible it left a bad taste in my mouth. I actually stopped paying attention to what was happening about half way through and I'm surprised I even made it that far. The ONLY cool thing about this film is the Alien/Predator Hybrid Monster that runs around killing everybody. Everything else about the movie was bad.
3,Good addition,"While not the best of the entire series, the special effects are amazing and a must have for anyone that has the entire collection. The biggest weakness to the newest Alien genre movies is that they give the creatures too much personality. This is why Aliens 1 & 2 were so great, the aliens were just killing machines, plain and simple. From 3 on, they started to take on too many human behaviors and it ruined the concept. With the new combination of the alien/predator creature, while a fun idea, it's still missing the draw of the original Sigourney Weaver landmark movies."
4,Better than I thought it would be after reading reviews,"Usually I stear clear of stuff with bad reviews. AVPR has some terrible reviews. But I like the other Alien movies (yeah I like Alien 3).I will admit that the lighting in this movie is a challenge. Some scenes seem darker than they should be. It is hard to make out details durring the fights. On the other hand I feel like the darkness adds to the movie in some ways. Seeing these creatures in good lighting might make them appear silly and out of character.I do feel like there are too many characters. You don't get to know anything about any of them. They seem to lack emotion. But its not the worst characters I have ever seen in a movie. They are passible.The only real plot here is the predator hunting down the aliens. If all the scenes involving people where cut from the film it would still be good.I guess its not a movie I could watch often, but maybe every once and a while."
1,avp=suckiem,"the first Predator was great, the second was good. The first AVP movie was so so. Now, with this one its gone sour. I really wish I didnt waste my time even watching it. C-List actors no one will recognize unless maybe their parents... At least I'm only out a dollar rental, you definitely dont want to purchase this garbage."
1,The worst movie ever and not just on DVD,"Just starting to write this review makes me think am wasting a few more minutes of my life on thinking about a movie that i would definitely not want even my worst enemy to watch with a gun to his head.If you absolutely want to waste 95 mins of your time, then head to the local library or just watch a free On-Demand Movie on Comcast.This is one movie which would make you hate ALL the original Alien and Predator Movies.Imagine this movie as a genetic experiment gone wrong when mating the original Alien and original Predator movie. Now add the acting of Doom Movie into this mix. You get the picture.The director and producer should have their licenses revoked for life and made to do penance for inflicting such a horrible movie on the public.I have watched Made-for-TV movies from sci-fi channel a lot. This is 10x times worse than the worst scifi channel ever made."
1,wish i had a smart and whitty title here,"I had to turn this POS off. I swore I would not bother to watch this after the last s*&^%y movie they did together, and god knows what possesed me to rent this. This one is horrible because I can not tell what the hell is going on... everything is dark and in shadows, it cut's from sewers to space, to darkness of the sky... it's given me such a headache trying to watch it I had to turn it off. And the plot was boring anyway.Who in the hell commissioned this dark pos for release?"
1,I listened to it!!!,"The movie sounded good, too bad you couldn't see it! It still could be a good AVP movie if they somehow lighten up the film so you can see what the hell is going on! But as I was sitting thru it, it made me think of an audio book! Very frustrating indeed! I'd say this is one movie you could turn up your speakers and turn off the tube to! Don't buy this unrated version, just wait until they come out with another revised version of it which will probably be titled ""AVP-Requiem Light!"""
1,Definitely crossed a line that should not have been crossed,I am a HUGE fan of the Alien series and even liked AVP. I think they couldve continued the AVP series with that movie.But this movie was just chaos.I could barely make sense of the battle scenes. I couldnt tell who was who?And that labor scene was just too much.There are certain lines you just done cross and that crossed it.It is a slap in the face to any woman who has gone through labor waiting to hold thier precious baby.It was unbearable for me to watch.I really wanted to like this movie and if it werent for that scene I mightve purchased it but unless I can delete that scene from the movie I wont be buying it.PITY.
2,AVP??? ABSOLUTELY VERY POOR... MOVIE!,"CHARACTERS ARE SO THIN AND USELESS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE NAMES BUT NUMBERS INSTEAD!THEY ALSO DIE IN REVERSE ORDER ON THE SCREEN. THE BIG PROBLEM WITH THIS MOVIE IS THAT IT'S SET IN AGE WHERE T.V. AND THE INTERNET BROADCAST EVERYTHING SO HOW IS IT THAT AS PER ""ALIENS"" WE'VE NEVER ENCOUNTERED A SPECIES AS YOU ARE DESCRIBING RIPLEY!!! THEY MADE THIS FOR SHOCK VALUE MORE THAN ANYTHING BECAUSE IT IS STUPID! I GAVE IT A 2 FOR ACTION AND EFFECTS."
2,TERRIBLE.WAAAAY TOO DARK!!,"All I really have to say is,wow,what a waste of time!Don't get me wrong here,this could've been much better if the LIGHTING WAS BETTER.Even just a little better!..its shot waaay too dark.THEN..oh how convenient -a power outtage(in the movie),so guess what?..MORE DARKNESS.If you could actually see whats going on,as far as the gore goes..it might be half-way decent..HALF WAY.Right when you think you'll see something..the scene cuts away..way too quickly.Anyways..even if your an Alien fan or Predator fan..I have feeling THIS will disappoint you.Even the PredAlien could've been done better..was KINDA cool though..just not THAT cool(for sure!)"
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The first AVP was a bit of a let down for one simple fact, it was rated PG-13. How the hell are you gonna do a versus of the two most brutal and best sci-fi series in the world, and make it PG-13??!! Well this one is everything the first one should've been. Amazing! Don't listen to all the bad reviews. Everyone's a crittic these days, geese. If you're a fan of the PREDATOR and ALIEN movies, than you will love this! It has the brutality and feel of the originals. Bottom line, it's entertaining. Like movies are supposed to be. What happened to the good old days when people enjoyed movies for what they're for, fun. Now everybody just looks for ways to cut them down and ""criticize"". A movie isn't really supposed to teach you a lesson or make you ""smarter"", it's supposed to take you out of the stressfull world we live in for a couple hours. Anyway, enough of that. If you like blood, guts, action, amazing visuals, predator, alien, and being entertained, this movie rules."
2,A Dark Chapter in the Series,I would like to tell you what this movie is about but I can't. The lighting in this movie was so bad that I could barely see what was going on. Maybe they shouldn't have hired that last actor and used to money to buy more lights.
3,Some things are over the top,"Overall, I like this movie but there are some suggested implications in scenes which are abhorrent. I won't spoil the movie for those who have not seen it. Let me just say that the action is quite non-stop and the violence is extreme. The conflict between the sole Predator and the hundreds of Aliens is well done, especially the finale."
2,Yawn ...,"Because we enjoyed the first Alien vs. Predator, we were really anxious for the sequel. What an utter disappointment! Much like Saw II was to Saw I ... it was a cheap, low budget, campy version of the first. Seemingly thrown together in a hurry with hopes of cashing in on the popularity of the first one. Complete with your gratuitous T & A, dumb frat kids (easy victims, I suppose), and weak character development that didn't even seem necessary or connected to the basic storyline except as 'filler' to occupy the majority of the time in between a the few monster scenes which were so dark they could barely be seen. No special effects, nothing imaginative or creative, and certainly not anything that could be considered suspenseful or scary."
3,Aliens vs. Singular,"Singular as in ONE PREDATOR!!! That's all I'm going to get? Come on man. There were three total and two were killed at the very beginning. Were they black? All hell breaks loss and one Predator decides to fix all the problems. Three could barely do it in the last film and they weren't fight an Alien/Predator mix. I was pretty disappointed with this. My next gripe was the acting. Wow, it wasn't horrible but I've seen better acting in reality TV. The story could have been a lot better. I wish they would take this series back into space somehow because the last two attempts to bring the war on earth sucked. At least it wasn't rated PG-13 like the last film."
2,no good,very poor story. lots of shooting nothing else b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b b baad
2,2 stars out of 4,The Bottom Line:The good news is that AVPR is mildly less ridiculous and annoying than the original (which seemed to think people in Antartica run around in t-shirts) but the bad news is that this is still a pointless and senseless exercise in gross violence that will make fans of the original franchises want to cry--if you fancy yourself a fan of Alien or Predator (or good movies) do not see this one.
1,Maybe a good movie if I could see it.,"The whole movie takes place in pitch darkness. I assume they do this so they wouldnt have to spend a lot of money on special effects. There are multiple parts where predator is messing around with his gear but you cant see anything, just the light reflecting off his armor.Becasue of this I have to say that this might very well be the worst movie I have ever seen, who the hell makes an entire movie is pure darkness."
2,A Very Bad Sequel!!!,"I saw this on 1-1-08 and I thought it would be cool to start off the year with an AVP movie. I was highly disappointed. Mostly the ending pissed me off with the Government killing all the suvivors in the town and the Aliens and Predators. I was cool that it started where the first one ended, but it's just that ending that really gets me. I remember some goth kids in the theatre laughing when the girl said something like ""The Government doesn't lie to people."" Don't watch this movie!!!THE GOVERNMENT RUINED IT!!!"
2,Big disappointment,"I know lots of people thought the first movie in this series (Alien vs. Predator) had a lot lacking, but I still ended up enjoying it. Sure, it couldn't compare to the first Alien or Aliens by any means, but it held some merit nonetheless. But this film is a complete horror to a decent predecessor. The story line lacks direction and it appears that the director just chose to include as much horror as possible to shock value. So while it may have some moments, this is one movie you can avoid."
3,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem (Unrated Edition,"All in all good story. A little gory with the pregnant women, but alright."
3,Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem,"I enjoy this film, but found it to much like the last film. The Predator had more of a human quality, (mental that is). The CGI was up to expectations, but nothing over whelming."
1,Awful...,"I'm a HUGE fan of all the Alien films and I enjoyed Alien VS. Predator, but this film was atrocious. The acting was supremely bad and the scene where the aliens burst out of the pregnant woman was absolutely sickening. It turned me off to the point of wanting to vomit. I can handle some blood and gore, but that was just plain wrong. I agree with other reviewers that the entire film was WAY too dark and you could barely see a thing. I guess that was done purposely to disguise this pathetic excuse of a movie. I won't ever watch it again."
1,So Dark its not worth it.,"I liked the idea of the first one and it was OK, but this one was just a waste of money. I guess that budgets in Hollywood have gotten so bad that they can pay for lighting. I could not see anything that would make this film even the least bit worth owning. I am sorry that I even rented it."
1,Humans v Aliens,"I went to see AVP Requiem in the theatre when it first came out as my son and I are huge Predator fans. Other than the first scene on the ship, this movie is predominately about the humans -- big disappointment. The script, dialog and lighting were horrible. In most of the scenes, you cannot even see either the aliens or the predator. The movie did not follow the AVP lore which also caused great consternation. I purchased the movie simply because I am such a huge fan of the Predator series and watched it with my daughter and her boyfriend to show how very bad it was. Although, there is the scene when the blonde gets pinned to the wall that was certainly entertaining -- all in all it is just terribly predictable. This AVP is along the lines of the later Star Wars flicks. Blech. Until they bring back the magic of the first AVP, I'll stick with reading the Alien v Predator and Predator series books."
1,Horrible!!!,This movie was Horrible!! The first one was much better and had a better story line. This time around it was so stupid that I could hardly believe my eyes. The fact that children were being killed was just a terrifying thought and the characters were totally predictable. I wouldn't waste my time seeing this.
1,Bad Alien/Predator movie,"Am a fan of the Alien and Predator movies, but this one is a waste of time, I read it got bad reviews, but I tried to keep an open mind, needless to say the reviews were accurate.Don't waste your money on this JUNK!"
1,Don't waste your money on the DVD.,"I don't know if the story was any good or not, I simply couldn't see it. Most of the movie was so dark that it was not watchable. When I buy a DVD I expect to be able to see something on the screen, good or bad, but in this case the transfer was dark to the point of being black. Save your money."
1,Alien freak but omg! This SUCKS!!,"This movie was awful. I was bored the entire time. The plot sucked. The actors were horrid and half the lines were forced. And I honestly think both the creaters of the origional AVP and this one pretty much ignored Alien and Pedator lore. Might as well as made up 2 new alien species to have this movie. Don't even get me started on the first one.The Hybrid was silly, and that entire thing where it just spit little embryos into people was stupid. Not to mention the negligible gestation time. They could have atleast made it semi-realistic..... ooo 5 minutes and you have hundreds of full grown aliens ooooo.Hmmmm 1 hybrid alien took out what was supposed to be a ship full of uber predators....wtf. I am so sorry for you mr. predators, they made you lame.This movie was a complete waste of my time. I'm so glad I didn't have to pay to see it. Oh look, it's wasting my time again by being so bad i'm compelled to write a review."
1,Save your money,"I've seen all of the Alien movies, as well as the Predator flicks. They were good products, like a Bentley or a Corvette. This junkpile is like a broken down rusted Yugo. The plot is disjointed, the lighting is terrible (another review said it looked like it was filmed through an oil filter) and it doesn't resemble anything you would expect from watching the previous movies. The effects are decent (when you can make out what you're trying to see) but in all, it's just a stupid teen slasher flick with a sci-fi undertone. If you want to see it, fine, but take my advice and rent it. The best use I found for my copy is to use the disc as a coaster."
1,Run for the Hills,"Be afraid, be very afraid. This is without doubt one of the worse movies ever made, and I even liked Waterworld and Doom. Please do not do as I did, and waste your hard-earned money, on this .001 stars movie."
1,Gory Screen Play Lack Depth,"This is perhaps the worse Alein movie I've ever seen and perhaps it's not fair that I write this review because I was never a Predator fan at all. The trend in contemporary horror films to show all the blood and guts doesn't frighten me, just nausiates me. I think there is a difference between suspense and nausea, and film makers need to learn the difference again. The movie has a cruel tone, which starts at the beginning when a father and sun have aleins burst out of their chest in a rather unsympathetic way. The cruelty doesn' stop and culmintates with a grotesque scene in a materiny ward. The wooden actors of the small town are so annoying I was rooting for the aleins to eat them. The Predator anit-hero has no redeeming qualities as it exhibits no compassion and is just fixated on destroying everything in it's path.If you like the early Alein movies spare yourself this film, if you like blood and gore knock yourself out. . ."
5,Excellent,A Great Film with fast paced non-stop action and great production design. i do however see the weakness of the story and the characters but who cares its a monster movie. This is basically your Large Budget B-Movie. A must see and must have for AVP Fans.
2,A V P 2 LITTLE TOO LATE,Too little of them and too much of us.We needed a battle royal between Alien and Predator instead of the brief glimpses we were afforded.A more sinister sub plot with government interventions in Alien tecnology would have been good.A more detailed developement of the Predalien would have formed a more detailed storyline.I am not a screen writer but considering the hype i don`t think they got it right.
3,Pushes Boundaries of Horror,"In all films I have seen, including horror, there is an unwritten rule: men and maybe some women can be killed, but kids and dogs survive. AVP Requiem ends that rule. The aliens who invade a rural Colorado town act like aliens, and there are some mighty disturbing scenes. DO NOT let anyone with an infant, or if they are pregnant, SEE THIS MOVIE. This rule-breaking made the movie more gripping and realistic. The alien beasts are great, but the human acting left much to be desired.The film is so dark, that even with only one light on, I could not see what was going on. You need to turn off all your lights, and even then, you squint at parts.The blood really flows in this one, and the Predator is fantastic. I sincerely hope that this ""Requiem"" will not be the last. The way the movie ended leaves it wide open for a third one."
3,I wanted it to be better,"I love this franchise but this installment was very lackluster. It was very hard to see what was going on with the fight scenes because they were very fast and dark, for most of the movie I was lost. I didnt get to like the characters their deaths meant nothing. I am so glad I rented this."
3,"ok, but the original avp is better","first off i am a big fan of the predator movies. i remember when i first saw avp. i was blown away. it had a good story the action was well choreographed and the ending was good and, obviously as most movies like this do, leave it open for a sequel. when i found it it had an alien predator my exact words were 'that is so freakin awesome!' when i watched it though, i was a bit disappointed. don't get me wrong, the action was fantastic and the gore level was were it should be. but it was one of those movies where the plot went nowhere. if you want to see a movie with good special effects and great action and gore you should definetely check it out. but if you want to see a great movie with an intersting plot and good choreagraphy, skip this and watch the original aliens versus predator"
1,Horrible lighting,"I didn't care about the filler. I just wanted to see the Aliens vs. Predator. Then I heard it was Predator vs. Alien/Predator ""Hybrids"". To be honest the lighting was so horrible I couldn't tell who was winning or losing.The movie's lighting was so horrible.The movie's lighting was so horrible.The movie's lighting was so horrible.That's what made the movie horrible. There was no Alien vs. Predator it was a hybrid. Then the Aliens vs. The Humans. The ending made no sense whatsoever at all."
1,Terrible Lighting...,"I had to turn the movie off. I could not tell what was going on when the scenes were dark. I'm sure the movie was good, I just couldn't see what was going on. Perhaps the creaters of these movies need to watch them before actually producing them."
1,"Disappointing, to say the least","So dark most of the movie is impossible to see. Just like Aliens vs. Predator, it compresses the breeding cycle of the Aliens which makes the timelines completely out of sync with the original Alien series. Cast of unknowns could have done well but the script and editing are so poor there's no recovery. Special effects are not bad. I barely remembered any of this movie after it was over."
1,I hate to say it but...,"I am a hardcore fan of franchise. ( Limited action figures, the works) Both movies were a major disappointment but at least the first AVP you could actually get a good look at the Aliens. (especially the queen) It was more CGI but what's the point in going to an Alien movie and not be able to see it in action. Both movies had plots that aren't even worth reviewing so I'll just stick to the creature effects."
3,Not as good as The First,"It's an interesting movie, but it doesn't seem as long as they lead you to believe. It's also really dark to where you can't really see anything. They could have made it better than what it is. It seemed a bit rushed. Not put together as well as you would hope for."
1,DONT RENT THIS,"The movie is so dark you cant see 99% of it. I read this happens for the blu ray and it wasnt like this in theaters but I was hoping streaming it wouldnt be that bad and honestly it was worse than I could have imagined. I have a brand new Plasma that I bought on amazon (check my reviews) and blu ray player and I tried all of the color settings and I honestly couldnt see much going on in the movie. This is a total rip off. I hope Amazon takes action and takes this movie down. Im going to write customer service about this later. Please, dont waste your money renting the HD version of this movie or from what i hear its just as bad on the dvd version. Stay away. Total waste of money. It sounded good. My best friend told me it was amazing in theaters but here its just a waste of [...]. DONT RENT THIS!"
1,Awful,"Dark, Loud, Incomprehensible, and Boring. Spits in the faces of the fans and anyone with an IQ above oh, wait, let's just say anyone with an IQ."
2,My Mistake,I ordered the wrong one it was not the fault of the person who sent it. It was my fault i hate this movie
3,Fair,It's good enough and it's part of the Alien timeline. In short it's worth watching once. . . Or twice.
3,At least it's better than the first Aliens vs Predator,"If you like Alien movies and you like Predator movies, this is surely worth at least one watch.While the first movie placed Predators in the Arctic, ignoring the concept of ""only in the hottest of summers..."", this one at least involves some forest backgrounds and dank sewers.The human characters are bland and not very well fleshed out, but this movie is not really about the humans, but rather the creatures themselves.If you want to see some cool familiar(and not so familiar) versions of your favorite creatures and weapons, take a look.If you're looking for an award winning bit of movie-making, you're probably not reading this review in the first place."
1,on line is crap,do not like the inordinate delays caused by the promo. Provider seems unaware that not all links are DSL or hyper linked and when on a public computer you can not wait days for a down load
2,WHY?,"I gave this movie another chance after seeing it on cable television and I must say ""I wasted my time."" The Predator Alien Franchise has to be embarassed by this Crap Show of a movie. The acting was mediocre, the special effects used and misused, the plot left me guessing WHY? No connection to the first at all. I just hope that if there is an AVP3 that it is not done by the Brothers Strause PLEASE!!!!!"
1,Worse than the first,"I didn't like the first Alien vs. Predator movie, so I didn't really expect to like this one. This is one of those instances where I was right. I did not like this movie at all. The plot wasn't as confusing as it was in the first one, so I suppose that's a step up, however the characters were even worse except for maybe one. And once again, I felt no suspesne at all throughout the entire film. And, everything was really dark. And I don't mean anything like the plot was dark, I mean it was literally dark. It was too dark to see what was going on. The action could have been a good point of the movie, but the extremely dark environment just held it back so much. So yeah, bad characters, no suspense, way too dark, and even though the plot was better than the previous movie's plot this one was still kinda dull. Just not a good movie at all. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"
2,"Yeah, another Alien\Predator movie. Wish I could have seen it","I have all the movies and I love both the franchises, but this movie is so dark I could not tell what was going on half of the time. Hope they come out with another version that is watchable, this one isn't."
1,Purchasers should demand a replacement,"If aliens and one predator initiated a fight in a dark cave during an eclipse to an audience of the blind, you would have this film.Notwithstanding some moments of lost continuity, such as the ubiquitous phosphorescent liquid with which the 'predator' is careful to dissolve evidence yet leaves a degloved victim hanging from a tree, I purchase each episode in the series.The studio owes the purchasers of this DVD, a replacement, and I would advise all to save money - the DVD is undeveloped film exposed to sunlight. My wife and I watched this in the theater during which the film was not so dark that one assumed it was audio-only. The DVD might as well be an audio disc; we could discern nothing until the brightness was increased to ridiculous levels.I intend to contact the manufacturer and demand a refund."
1,rip off!! too dark!,don't waste your time for watch movie. it not good and too dark. don't buy it and save your money before you will upset. that's why i took rent dvd and watch once. too boring and too dark nahh!!!
2,AVP stands for A Very Pitchblack movie,"this movie is too dark and I wonder if these darkness was made on purpose.Why?afraid to show that the film really does not have much to offer?Did not they want to show the predator and the aliens explicitly?But why? The fantastic atmosphere of the original saga had already been lost in the first AVP. It is just a frantic-paced C-movie trying to imitate a film from the fifties. There are slight references to the first Alien, like the name of one of the characteres, Dallas (played by Tom skerrit, in the first movie), the military girl , obviously an allusion to lt.Ripley,the population of the small town is expendable like the crew of Nostromo...but what for? Not totally bad but it should end here. Please, no AVP-3..."
2,Sorely disappointed,"As a long time fan of both the Alien and Predator franchises, and the first Alien Vs Predator, this one was a let down. There was some effort to build the perspective of the Predator, and give some insight into their culture, but what little good was there was lost in the ill-considered effort to dumb-down the movie to the lowest common denominator. The flagrent effort to tap into the slasher movie genre ruined what could have been a real positive addition to the series.E.M. Van Court"
2,What was this?,"I must have dozed off several times during this movie because I felt like I had totally missed quite a large part of the story. There are people who know people but we don't know why or how they met. There are plot holes bigger than the aliens themselves. The characters are wooden and uninteresting. I am a big fan of both the ""Alien"" and ""Predator"" series of movies but I think maybe they should stop here. Even the original ""Alien vs Predator"", as bad as it was, was much better than this sequel. I never had a clue as to what was actually going on, other than aliens and predators blasting each other and any human that got in their way. Plus, the DVD I had was so dark I could barely see the picture. Just a total insult to an interesting franchise."
1,"Dear God , This Movie Is Horrible","i tried to give this movie a chance since the first one was decent. not only is the plot horrible , a rip off of all horror movie cliches and the actors cant act their way out of a box but the CGI effects and lighting are HORRIBLE! its DARK the entire filmu dont even get to see whats going on durin the whole movieit was seriously painful to finish this piece of ..exactlydont watch it"
2,Another by the numbers sequel,AvP-R is another by the number sequels that has cool special effects ut easily could have been released direct to DVD instead of coming to the big screen. The film has no A-list stars to speak and script that is very weak. However the film does supply action and a good scare or two.
1,@#$@Y%#,"because humans make movies like this, we would be prime for aliens to come use us for target practice. my goodness, i thought my eyes were lying to me.this movie is like smelling a nasty azz fart with your eyes.I quote my sterling review of battlefield earth as it directly is applicable to this piece of cr@p:""if aliens ever attacked earth, we could show them this movie and they would leave. ""nuff said."
4,Exciting!,"Predator has always been one of my favorite characters. He's such a bass a** alien. I liked Predator 1 and 2 more than the AVP sequel, however the AVPs were still great to watch.AVPR is different from AVP because this time Predator is fighting against an Alien that mutated into something between the Alien type and the Predator one. He's something in between! He's also stronger than the regular Aliens Predator used to fight against in AVP.The movie stayed exciting tll the end. I didn't appreciate the ending that much because the Aliens and Predator got killed very easily by humans via a nuclear bomb. But I guess that was the only way to get rid of them since Aliens were spreading all over the place.Anyway, I really don't wana see a new AVP movie anymore. We are tired of seeing Predator fighting against Aliens and humans getting stuck in between.I'd love to see a Predator Vs. Batman movie. That would be awsome!"
4,Friggin Sweet Movie,"The bloodiest and most action packed Alien film since James Cameron's Aliens. I would have given this five stars except the story and characters aren't quite up to par with the first AvP film (which sadly lacked the action and gore). Still, it's one of my faves. If it's not one of yours, then your taste in movies sucks. Buy this. Buy it now.PS - Runnnn! Get to ze choppa!!!!!"
3,Alien Vs Predator Requiem,This one is better than the first though the story is lacking in substance and the characters are bland. However I have to say the seeing the Aliens and Predators are a big selling point for me. On Blu Ray i find them much more interesting. Check it out for yourself and decide.Aliens vs. Predator - Requiem (Extreme Unrated Set) [Blu-ray]
2,Blu-Ray Cant Save This,"Sorry, but this film is just way too dark, and not dark as in scary, but dark as in DARK. I bought the blu-ray thinking it could be an improvment, but no, same issue, just to damn dark.the original Predator film didnt even have this much night footage and it came off great, but this, they are just trying to hide so much its so unwatchable :("
2,what a let-down................. :(,"oh gosh, where to start? fisrt of, the acters are TERRIBLE and say the silliest things eg. ""people are dying, we need guns"" and not only this, but the setting is silly, and completly diffrent to the first avp.the only thing that is the same would be the alien, and the predators (even then, there designs have been changed. i really do think that if they had a better cast and setting, and took a bit more time to think about things, it would have been at least a 4 star movie. 2 stars for the effects, but not as good as the first................very dissapointing......"
3,"Blame the story, not the lighting","After reading most reviews about this movie, I can agree that the story left A LOT to be desired. True: the aliens grow at a light speed rate. True: 98% of the film takes place at night and in a rainstorm. False: the lighting in this movie is ""horrible."" I never had to strain my eyes once to make out what was happening in this film. No offense people, but some of you may want to have your vision checked.As a fan of the series, I can also agree that I don't think there are too many places left to go with the characters. Maybe bring in a ""Terminator"" or something? Anyway, I didn't feel like this film is a waste of time if you're a fan."
1,"Worse movie ever seen,","This was really bad from the start, the story, acting, etc was really bad. I have long been a Predator fan, but this movie was a real let down. Please do not spend you money on this at all, it's not even worth renting. You are warned.Philip."
4,"good movie,great price",This movie I had to have after watching it on tv couple of months ago and in my opinion it's better than the other Aliens vs Predator movie.Thanks to the seller and Amazon for giving me the opportunity to make this purchase.
3,Great DTS sound !!!,"This is just a regular movie with good transcription to the blu-ray disc. But the DTS sound is amazing !!! Makes you ask why all the DVDs and Blu-ray discs don't come with this option of sound, because generally all the movies are recorded with the DTS sound. And always it is the best sound !!! [...]."
2,it's completely dark!!!,"i saw this film at the theater and it was a normal movie with good light and shadow. warning for the bluray version of film, every second from beginning to end is nearly pitch black. don't bother trying to adjust the color. this specific title transfer to disk is just bad!"
3,Better than the last one,I think my title says it all. Of course the last one sucked so bad that The Wiggles TV show is better than it was. AvP:Requiem starts out really slow and only picks up speed about half way through. Like in the last AvP the dialog is banal and the acting not great but at least this time I wasn't laughing my but off because of it. There are some pretty gory scenes and fights that makes this movie at least watchable. If you don't mind lots of blood and are of fan of Alien or Predator movies this might be something you want to pick up if there is nothing else on that looks interesting.
1,RUINS THE GOOD NAME OF BOTH!!!,"Note to makers of this film.....BUY A LIGHT BULB!!!!!! too disgusted to write a full review but as Phillip L. Roderick ""Poe Fanatic"" stated it so perfectly, I don't need to say anything more. I will accept not being able to give it less than 1 star as there are Aliens & Predators in the film(when you can actually see them that is)"
4,Alien vs. Predator - Requiem,"If you are interested in a good action movie then this is worth buying. Maybe it would be different if I had read the books, but I enjoyed this quite a bit."
2,Someone shoot whoever greenlights these scripts,"The people at Fox never learn: it happened with Alien 3 with David Fincher, Alien Resurrection with the french guy I don't recall his name, AVP with Anderson, and now AVP-R....is it really that hard to write a good Alien/Predator film? Have they not learned yet?...the people who write and direct these movies do not have any idea of the Alien & Predator mythology. The fight scenes sucked, the acting, the characters....the one thing I could say I liked was the gore and R-rating, but most of the scenes were badly lit so it didn't matter if it was PG or R-rated.I really thought this was going to be the one they got right, but 20 minutes into the movie I was proven wrong.Maybe to us Alien fans the only thing was the end of the film, which was a nod to the rest of the franchise. I wouldn't bother buying this, better rent it."
3,aliens vs. predator : requiem unrated,why is the blu ray and the dvd versions - both unrated show different time length did anyone buy the blu ray and is it the same length as the dvd
1,terrible,i guess it wasn't even worth the 12 cents + shipping. total nonsense. i could only watch 3 minutes of it.
1,DEFECTIVE DVD'S BEING SOLD!,"DO NOT PURCHASE IT. THE THEATRICAL RELEASE IS EXCELLENT QUALITY. THE DVD IS DEFECTIVE. IN THE THEATRE THE TREES AND PLANTS IN THE FOREST ARE GREEN AND BEAUTIFUL. THE SUNLIGHT IS BEAUTIFUL. THE BLOOD IS RED. THE CREATURES AND ACTION ARE SUSPENSEFUL AND EXCITING TO WATCH. THE DVD IS HORRIBLE. THE TREES AND PLANTS ARE BLACK, THE BLOOD IS BLACK. THE SCREEN GOES BLACK MANY TIMES. YOU CAN'T SEE THE ALIENS OR THE PREDATOR DETAILS. YOU SIMPLY ONLY HEAR THE MOVIE BUT CANNOT WATCH IT. IT IS AN OBVIOUS FACTORY PRODUCTION FAILURE. I ENJOYED IT AT THE THEATRE. I WAS FURIOUS WHEN I TRIED TO VIEW THE DVD. I ONLY WATCHED ABOUT 40 MINUTES OF THE GARBAGE BEFORE I TOOK IT OUT OF THE DVD PLAYER. I SENT MY COPY BACK AS DEFECTIVE."
3,WARNING - PITCH BLACK!!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS,I loved AVP1 and think AVP2 was just as good BUT the quality of the DVD is horrible. SImply horrible. Previous reviews warned of this but I said to myself how bad could it really be. BAD!!!! VERY VERY BAD!!!!!!!! 70% of the movie was barely manageable to see and the other 30% one could not see at all. There were fast moving scenes that will make you feel off balanced trying to follow the fast movement with the darkened effect. I absolutley agree with others who complained about the poor visual quality of AVP2. NOT worth the purchase if I had to do it all over again. I look forward to AVP3 and will adhere to warnings if the quaility of AVP3 rivals that of AVP2.
1,Pretty Bad. Save Your Money,"Being a fan of the Alien series, I had looked forward to this.What a waste.It's the old slasher movie formula, but with Aliens and a Predator. Get the teens together, the bad ones get killed, the good one survives. It was all so clichéd, it was tough to watch through. No innovation at all in this story.Most of the movie is so dark (as in no lighting) I couldn't tell what was going on. These idiot directors might have saved a lot of money, and just released a sound track."
2,"A lot of gore, but a terrible bore...","Only check out this sequel if you are a fan of gore. They really amp up the blood and guts in this one. Unfortunately, as is oft-mentioned in these reviews, it looks like The Brothers Strause made a final digital adjustment to the film and darkened all the imagery. So, the gore is there, but it's hardly discernible. A very weak script with laughable lines doesn't help either. I enjoyed the first AVP and was looking forward to this one. But it only left me hoping the next chapter would be an improvement."
1,Drawing the line,I draw the line with pregnat(sp) in labor being injected with an alien baby. I stopped the movie right after that. I'm a mother and I went through labor twice. Sorry I'm drawing the line with that. I will not watch that movie again. Luckly I got it OnDemand so I don't have to have the DVD to worry about. I'll be sticking with the first Alien vs Predator from now on.
3,CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT's HAPPENING!!!!!!,It is hard to understand what is happening after it gets dark. Most of the movie it is dark. But what I could see every time was good enough I guess. LIGHTEN UP THE MOVIE!!!!!!
2,"Coulnd't watch the whole movie, the image is TOO DARK!","I don't know if the movie's good or bad, I could only watch it like 20 or 25 minutes because the image is TOO DARK. At some parts, I couldn't see what was going on in the movie. Is it the DVD transfer? Was it like this in the theatres?I've written to amazon asking for a refund. I couldn't watch the whole movie! I had to turn off the TV because the screen was too painful to look at. Very disappointing."
2,I was hoping for better,"Some movies are worth a thousand word treatise.The lighting, for whatever reason, is too dark to be enjoyable and the movie is difficult to watch for that reason alone.When you can make them out the graphics and special effects show this to be a big budget production. Unfortunately the script writing is a pretty fair match for the grade B acting and none of the characters are convincing enough to give a damn about when they meet a predictably tasteless and gruesome end.Because neither of the villainous reptilian monsters (good guy/ bad guy... maybe but who knows) have any lines it's not so easy to understand any real motive behind the wholesale slaughter. Being an action adventure I guess you're not supposed to care. I didn't...Some movies are worth making it to the theater, the popcorn and anticipation ... others are worth the price of the DVD. If you decide to rent it go ahead but personally I thought the download was a waste of bandwidth."
4,Aliens fighting Predator? Check.,"I'll make this simple. If you grew up watching Aliens and Predator as a kid, or reading the classic Dark Horse comic the first AvP was total garbage. A lack of action and ""friendly"" Predators doomed that film from day one. AvP:R is filled with weak acting and lame horror cliches, but it does deliver one good thing......Aliens fighting Predator! There's plenty of scenes in which the two real stars of the film rumble and fight to the death in glorious battle scenes that should make any fan smile. This is much closer to the comics than the original and reminds me of when I was 12 and bought Alien/Predator action figures and had them tear each other apart! If you remember doing this too with your toy collection, AvP:R will make you remember why it's cool when monsters clash!"
4,Typical alien type of movie,Unless you really like aliens and predators you probably will not like this. I enjoy both movies so I found this to be perfectly ok.
1,Dont waste your time,"I watched this crap about 40 minutes and couldnt take any more. I own all the Preditor and Alien disks and I cant figure out how this made the platform. First of all, the movie must have been done on the night shift. No light at all. I didnt see anything but dark things or whatever. Even the somewhat lit sceens were dark and dim. The coryogrophy or whatever may have been fine but I couldnt see it so I dont know. The 40 minutes I seen of it sucked, so what ever. The actors did there job. Too bad I couldnt see them. Common guys, light, depth of field, contrast, animation, simulation but not this.The sad thing is they have most likely made $40 mill on this crap alredy.ED"
1,Would've been good - if I could've seen anything.,"Seriously, this dvd is way too dark. I couldn't make out any details on either the predator or the alien. The only way I could distinguish the hybrid was the dreadlocks and tail combination in silhouette. Maybe there was some light reflection off the hybrid's alien face but that was it. Could anybody actually see anything in this movie??"
1,Horrendous! Pitch Black,"My wife and I both loved AVP. It began with an archeological dig, which we love, paying homage to The Thing. AVP 2, as we'll call this, was a disaster.There was a lot of action. That's true. If we'd been able to see any of it, it would have been good. This movie made us stop and increase brightness for our picture to where it distorted every other channel/movie. Just so we could try to watch AVP 2.The aliens were given dreadlocks (I think--hard to really see), so it was almost impossible to tell if it was an alien or the Predator.The day in this Colorado town was odd: 23 hours plus of night each day. We'd get about 10 minutes of daytime action, then it would be night again. And impossible to see what was happening. What a sorry disappointment."
1,Please feed The Brothers Strauss to the Aliens.,"It might have been a LITTLE fun if you could have SEEN anything. It's almost unbelievable that anyone could spent $40 million dollars on a film that is so DARKLY LIT that you can't see a f#$%ing thing!I guess these film makers forget that peaple actually want to WATCH a film. I was pleasantly surprised with AVP (my first reaction on seeing the title was ""god that's stupid"") but it was actually pretty cool. Unfortunately, this one goes on the trash heap. What a shameful waste."
1,Not even for mindless slasher fun! Can't see a thing!!!,"This is going to be really quick. This is literally the worst lighting (or lack thereof) I have ever seen! Light is one of the most basic aspects of film and this has none of it! I'm watching it as I write this review and I can barely make out a face and I NEVER see the Alien or Predator fully. Many hunting scenes were lost of any suspense for me because i couldn't see anything!! I hear it's different on Blu-Ray if you have 1080p and a decent television but after this I don't even care anymore. I will never watch a film by these directors again. I put them in the Uwe Boll caliber of directing, with a slight nod to Uwe becuase at least i could SEE his films--I just wish I hadn't."
1,Awful... useless... one of the worst movies ever!,"I could not believe it. This os simply one of the worst movies ever. IT's cheap, sickening, useless. IT does not serve even as mindless fun. evn if your turn off your brain, your senses will alert you how the intentions of the producers are fake, from the absurd lack of lightning (where you can't see the fights), to fast editing, through horrible ""acting"" and obnoxious directing (by two guys!)It's onet of the worst movies ever, where producers thought: ""This is trash, but some people will enjoy it"". It's the worst that Hollywwod can offer.Yes, I'm a sucker, because I've watched it. I did not even rent it, or downloaded it, I BOUGHT the DVD! (because, believe it or not, I thought the fist movies, although completely unecessary and forgettable twenty minutes after leaving the theater, an enjoyable one)."
1,"Unoriginal, Low budget, Poorly Filmed....","If you were barely able to sit through AVP, This one isn't what you'd expect at all. Opening night I went with all my buddies, and suprisingly it was a packed theater until 30 min into the film.This movie Lacked everything... acting, character development, story.. it was just a CGI production show that still didn't shine at its greatest yet inconcieved moments....These new movies will never be able to be in the same ranks as the original Predator 1-2 and Alien 1-2 series due to amatuer Directors. But thats just my opinion.... Don't waste your money buying it, Rent it at blockbuster or download it if your that bored."
1,Everyone Involved Deserves A FaceHugger Of Their Very Own!,"Loathsome, boring and stupid crud that does not even achieve Z movie status.Have I mentioned the fact that this insult to our intelligence is despicable?A lame attempt at edginess which only succeeds in pounding a long overdue stake through both zombie-like and increasingly unprofitable franchises - and I must gloat.Finally put them out of their misery, fools. And us!Except for some ridiculously brief glimpses of the Predators' technology and home planet - which are imaginatively conceived but ineptly lit, shot and edited - and one long shot of their crashed ship, there is NOTHING worth seeing in this thing.As for the repulsive hospital sequence: for that one scene alone I will enjoy - and encourage everyone else with a shred of decency - to boycott any and all future sequels.RIP - NOT!"
2,The Best of the Scottish Fiddle Orchestra,"The sound was mushy and could not be corrected even with 6 Klipch speakers and a mixer. The picture was out of focus and the colors not vibrant.Many of the players displayed no personality (certain exceptions existed, like the base players).I own all of their CDs (I think) and have watched them perform their Albert Hall show on PBS. I like them. I respect the organization, but would I recommend this effort. Unfortunately, no."
3,Not a big fan.,"These are OK, in that they are constructed OK. But they are strangely cut...too much room (meaning it sits ""low"") in the front, and higher in the back...seems backwards, and it's kind of weird. Generally, they're OK. I won't buy any more of them."
2,Working class folks better budget for Brooks books!,"Post copied from my other post regarding Mr Brooks as it is applicable.The paperback edition of this is cheaper than the Kindle edition!!!!!! What is wrong with Mr Brooks!! Stand up for your readers and kick a little of the publishing savings down to us!! I will be looking for more affordable authors until then. (See Michael Manning, KC May, or Hugh Howey)."
4,"Kingdom of Landover's final ingredient in ""Witches Brew""","""All of my questions will be answered soon!"" is what I thought to myself when I was about 3/4 of the way through ""The Tangle Box"", 4th book in the Kingdom of Landover series. I soon realized that I was mistaken, and it was not the final book. Oops! What was I thinking!?!I scrambled to purchase the final book..""Witches Brew"". I am happy to say that the level of action and mystery in this 5th and final installment has made the wait well worth it!"
2,Opinion on this audio version,"I enjoyed the story, however as I travel a lot I rely on audio books to help me pass the travel time. I really enjoyed Dick Hill's narration, and his voices (except for Willow) were wonderful. The narration by Cameron Beierle is very flat and uninteresting. I wish now I had purchased the cassette, which did have Dan Hill's narration."
3,Witches' Brew,"Still good, but Terry Brooks starts being repetitive - you can figure out the plot in the first half"
3,Not as good as the others.,"I was a bit disappointed in this installment of the Landover saga. I felt that it didn't live up to the standard set by the previous four. Ben Holiday seemed a bit out of character in that he didn't even think of Nightshade as being part of the picture. That doesn't sound like him at all...he would never overlook her, no matter how long she'd been gone. Still, it was an enjoyable book, but I still prefer the others."
3,"""The Love of a Master"" is somewhat disappointing novel",I adore John Preston writing and had previously brought his books. This novel is somewhat not very intriguing. The plot more of repeating itself. Another thing is that perhaps John Preston is too cautious in HIV/AIDS education that he put in some condoms use for oral sex between the players.
4,Forgotten Florida History,The book should be part of all Native Floridians recommeded reading. The history of our state is more than tourist and palm trees. Before there was a wild west there was an wild and undeveloped area called Florida. This book is for those interested in history and the people that lived in the area.
5,"The ""must have"" title of the Second Seminole War","Mahon's work is simply timeless. It is the best overview, with some detail, of the Second Seminole conflict. There is sufficient detail for the history buff, while giving the novice a great foundation for further reading (Dade's Last Battle comes to mind). I did not find the reading difficult at all, and have re-read the book several times. If you want one title for this period of history, or if you are starting a collection, this is one title you ""must have"""
3,MUDDY,"I keep reading that Joe Locke is the new vibes genius, but based on this effort, Milt Jackson is not being threatened. Actually I really cannot make a determination about what I think of Joe Locke based on this CD, because all the players are playing on top of each other, and you really can't hear Joe. This is the standard Modern Jazz Quartet insturments plus a guitar. The guitar doesn't belong here. It's grating and confusing. The production quality is very poor. The bass doesn't exist, making the songs have that incomplete feel. You really need a bass to substanitize music. ""Mission Impossible"" suffer badly from this situation. It just isn't there. The fast songs are harsh sounding as a result of this. The slows songs are good enough, because at least you can differentiate the instruments. I wouldn't buy this. If Joe Locke is such a good player, and someone I should listen to, then I'll have to keep searching, because, uh uh, not on here."
3,"Good product, but not for a lower riding car...","Just a note to those out there...this is a good product, so I don't want to diss that, it's solid, goes together well, folds up well but I wouldn't:But it if you need to add a hitch converter...that means you have a 1.25 "" hitch and you have to buy the 2.0 hitch converter. When you do that your car is probably too low to the ground and it will both stick out too far and ride too low...mine ended up scrapping the ground a bitch and I had to leave on vacation.If you have a car or a smaller stationwagon like mine (I have a chevy HHR) then buy a smaller one that angles the hitch up so it gets away from the ground."
2,Does not fit a Pontiac Torrent '06,"I bought this for a long trip with my family but was extremely disapponted to find that it did not fit my Torrent's hitch despite the advise of the seller's parts service person. Since I was in a bind for time, I bought an attachment that would allow this carrier to fit my hitch but 100 miles into the trip the hitch was scrapping the ground since the adaptor made the hitch sit way too far back from the car. I had not put much weight on it yet it was not the right thing for my car. If you have a Pontiac Torrent do not buy this item as it will not fit your 2' hitch."
3,"Sturdy Product, Misleading Photo","Overall, the product appears to be well built and sturdy. It took about an hour to assemble by myself. With help, it could easily be done in less than an hour. My only complaint is that the photo is misleading in two respects. First, it does not come with side rails. Fortunately, I read an earlier review which noted that fact and was not surprised when it did not come with the side rails. Second, the photos make it appear as if the carrier sits close to the bumper of your vehicle. That is not the case. In fact, this carrier sits out about twenty inches from the bumper of your vehicle. My guess is that it has to do with the hinge that allows the carrier to fold up. In any event, if I had any idea that it stuck out that far, I would have opted for the non-folding variety. But, other than that, the product appears to be sturdy and suitable for its purpose."
4,nicely made product,"I bought this product as a Christmas present for my boyfriend. Cargo hitches are rather expensive, but Amazon had a special running plus free shipping, which came in handy since the box weighed 50lbs! It is easy to assemble, with nice and sturdy constuction. The fold up option is great. Only drawback is that when it's down, it sticks out really far, which isn't a good thing when it's on a Full size F-250 with an extended cab and a long bed. But other than that, it's a great product and i'd tell anyone that's looking for this kind of item to pick one up. Just wait till shipping is free!"
4,A must have,I bought this as a Christmas gift and have really enjoyed the use of it so far. The Cargo Carrier is heavy and required two people to install. It frees up a lot of space in the vehicle. Downside is not being able to see it while in the vehicle. You have to remember the Carrier is onboard when backing up to avoid a disaster. Very sturdy and supplies ample room for our varies activities.
4,"Somewhere between DrumN'Bass and Ambient, moody and chilling","This CD is not for the untrained ear! I suggest listening to it first, with headphones, alone preferrably, and all in one sitting. The result is a dark and sometimes frightening mix of breakbeats and distorted electronic bass-lines, and occasional melodies.Spooky but yet beautiful.I only resent the fact that there are no vocal additions since this music pleads for poetry, however bizarre the outcome. A must buy for melancholic listeners.."
5,Grotesquely ignored,"I am astonished that this LP isn't better known. It must be because its coming from somewhere that is too difficult for many people to face. The use of sound loops and incredibly complex rhythms creates an extraordinary feeling of deja vu, yet the music is quite unique. An genuinely tender, violent, moving and disturbing record."
5,Kerry Rocks,I have been listening to Kerry play throughout Orange county for the past 5 years and this album is the one that hooked me. The writing is incredible and she has an absolutely beautiful voice.
4,very enjoyable listening,you have to hear kerry's amazing voice to believe it! she is truly talented; a great live performer as well
4,Excellent Album,"Kerry's voice & her songwriting are intriguing yet accessable. The emotional textures & images remain with me. I was especially touched by the song ""INHALE""."
5,No Talent more deserving of attention,"Kerry Getz is one of those people like Maria McKee, Aimee Mann and Jane Siberry, who's music is so pure and original, you listen and wonder why they're not getting the attention they deserve.When so much of the music getting attention is so superficial, an album like ""Apollo"" is so refreshing. There's not a bad song on this album, but in particular, ""Beautiful To You"" stands out as an achingly, heartwrenching song about unrequited love and the self doubt that follows.The songs themselves are as original as the artist. Do yourself a favor, buy all three albums. You won't regret it."
3,You don't get quite what you pay for.,"While this case looks fairly nice on the wall, it lacks the fit and finish I expected for the price. The materials are flimsy and the painted wood doesn't extend to the rear of the case door; from a rear angle you can see bare pine. A good purchase for home, not so great for the office."
4,Great baseball bat case with logo,"It's great. I got it with the Red Sox logo and it's perfect for my David Ortiz autographed bat. Good quality, attractive, relatively inexpensive. Arrived on time, easy to hang on wall. Only complaint is that it didn't come with mounting screws, but no big deal. I definitely recommend it."
3,Fictionalized account of the Peleus Affair,"This novel is a slightly fictionalized account of the March 13, 1944 ""Peleus Affair"", in which U-852 under the command of Kapitänleutnant Heinz Eck sank the S.S. Peleus and then attacked rafts occupied by defenceless survivors with machine guns and grenades. The actions and motivations of the U-boat officers are accurately narrated, and their subsequent trial (which took place October 17-20, 1945) is described.All things considered, a pretty good read."
1,not great kids book,"My boys (ages 10, 9, 7, 5) and I found this book to be dull. We love history, but this one was lacking. It also had several instances of profanity which was surprising to me for a book that I thought was aimed at kids."
2,Too bad this movie doesn't really follow the book - sad!!!,"Howdy,After I read the book ""The Shadow Riders"" from Louis L'Amour I had to have this movie.But what a disappointment!Only about 30% of the movie content follows the book.I will never understand how these movie makers destroy good stories.I love watching western movies and I collect them (have abt. 100 now).In this movie most of the characters act like they are having fun witheverything. Not once did I see the real concern about those kidnappedpeople. The whole thing just looks to clean and like a Sunday picnic.Why the hell did they have to bust out Happy Jack Traven (Black Jack) ofjail? Instead of adding dubios action scenes, they should have just stuckwith the book and we would be able to see a 5 star movie. Too bad!!!I gave two stars, because I love Ben Johnson and Tom Selleck.Wil"
3,Not The Best....read on,"I was kinda disappointed with this movie. I purchased it after seeing ""Quigley Down Under"" and ""Crossfire Trail"". Which were both excellent to the extreme. I found this movie rather boring and hard to watch even. The plot is very thin. My suggestion is rent it and try it before buying."
3,typical of '80s movies,"I am a fan of Tom Selleck westerns and have seen all of his later (western) movies so I decided to buy this earlier movie that I have not yet seen. The movies were typical '80s faire (as viewed from 2010!). Lighting, sound, camera action all had a decidedly 'amateurish' feel. Selleck was the only actor of any credibility in the cast, even Sam Elliott has a long way to go in his career at this point. Overall, however, I enjoyed watching the movie. It was easy-going with non-offensive language."
5,Shadow Riders,Came in less then a week please with DVD thank you jerrylijlhall and amazon I will order from jerrylihall again. Very please
2,Not a great production,"I was totally unimpressed with this movie. I am a huge L'Amour fan, but the movie that resulted was slow and boring."
1,Not as Good as you would think!,"I'm sorry to have to say this movie was slow moving & boring at times. The story line was good, but not filled in with enough action, as you would expect a western to have. I think this story would have been better served as a hour TV special, removing all the useless parts that made it boring at times. This review is not against the actors, they did a good job with what they had... they didn't have much to work with is all. Buy another Tom Selleck western, he has made many other good ones. Quigley Down Under... one of his best!"
3,Good Western but Not Great,This movie is good but I prefer Quigley Down Under as Tom Selleck's best western.
2,OK -But Not What I expected,"I was caught up in the advertising hype which mentioned ""Lonesome Dove""and I thought it was a sequel by the same author, not Louis Lamour."
2,Rent if you're curious; Don't buy this dog!,"I like both Selleck and Elliot in most of their westerns, but this is the exception that makes the rule. It does have its moments, particularly, in the final showdown. But, for the most part, it plods along with terrible dialog, huge lapses in logistical logic, and a ridiculous musical score that must have been barrowed from anything but a western. I can't blame the actors since they had to contend with a script that seemed like a 12 year old had written. Rent this or, better yet, Tivo it when it's on the late, late, late movie where it belongs. If the prequel, `The Sacketts,' is anything like this dog, I'll have to pass on it."
2,VERY disappointing,"This is the movie that soured Louis L'Amour on Hollywood. According to an interview, L'Amour so wished that they would have the screenplay follow his stories. This movie doesn't come close and suffers for it.The book was pure Western drama, while the film is tongue in cheek humor.One of the best characters in the book is no where to be found in the move, that being Kate's uncle. He is incredibly interesting in the book, and is the reason the girls never are taken from the shore as they are in the movie.Kate's character is strong in the movie, but much stronger and more plausible in the book. Lastly, Uncle Jack is made into a scalawag in the movie, while in the book is much more a true uncle.The movie does have a great cast, exceptional costuming, and some funny one liners, but if you have read the book you will find the movie very disappointing."
4,THE SHADOW RIDERS,"THIS IS A WELL DONE MOVIE, A MUST HAVE FOR THE LOUIS LAMORE FAN, NOT TO MENTION THAT SELLECK AND ELLIOTT ARE GREAT COWBOYS IN THE MOVIES. I WAS GLAD THAT I BOUGHT THE MOVIE."
5,HERE COMES THOSE HANDSOME TRAVEN BROTHERS OF TEXAS!,"This is another one of my all-time favorite western movies! Sam Elliott, and Tom Selleck are my good looking, handsome cowboy heros!The Travens get into all kinds of trouble! The Traven Brothers all come home after the Civil War is over, and find that their younger brother, and their teenage sisters have been stolen, and solded to a slave trader, who is going to ship them on a boat to another country, and one of the Traven Brother's childhood sweetheart (Kate), has also been stolen, to be sold with the others.So all the Traven Brothers, with the help from their Uncle(Ben Johnson) who is a outlaw, go on the trail to find their love ones. I highly recommend this movie! And Sam Elliotts real life wife (Katherine Ross),is in this movie, she plays (Kate), his childhood sweetheart!"
2,Buyer beware,"This review is not regarding the actual film itself, but rather the poor quality of this DVD release.The transfer used on this ""25th Anniversary Edition"" DVD is of VHS quality. The colors are extremely dull and washed out, and it's clear that the print did not come from a film source.This is quite surprising considering the transfer used on the Trimark DVD released way back in 1998 did come from a good looking film print! That is still the version to get if you're seeking the best looking transfer available on DVD.The 5.1 audio mix used is also quite generic. It has no extra depth over the original 2.0 mix, and even sounds ""tinny"" in a fake sort of way.They've also shoved all of the bonus material onto a single-layer disc, and thus compression artifacts are often very noticeable.The bonus features on the disc are interesting, but nothing to scream home about. And you can find all of these features on the previous ""Collector's Edition"" that this same DVD studio released in 2005."
4,Modern Westerns,"The day of John Wayne, James Stewart, Gregory Peck, Henry Fonda, and the rest is gone. They made Westerns when there were still people alive who knew what the old west was really like and gave them pointers. When Tom Selleck and Sam Elliot made a few Westerns several years ago, they may not be quite up to the standards of classics like the ""Magnificent Seven"", ""High Noon"", and ""Hondo"" but I personally think they are excellent and a far cry better than any other Westerns made in the last 20 years. The cast even includes a few old timers from the classic Westerns like Ben Johnson and Harry Carey Jr. which is a real treat since they have still got what it takes to create a great character. With the upcoming release of ""The Sacketts"" you have all the more reason to view it and this as they go together like a set. I recommend purchasing them both and ""The Last Stand at Saber River"", ""Crossfire Trail"", and ""Conagher"". All excellent modern Westerns with Tom Selleck and/or Sam Elliot."
5,A great movie,"This is an excellent western film. You should consider watching it for Ben Johnson's role, alone. Mr. Johnson is a great western film actor, and his role as ""Uncle Jack"" is superb. If you enjoy western genre, I suggest you consider adding this film to your collection. The team of Tom Selleck, Sam Elliott, and Jeff Osterhage is an excellent mix. I hope Hollywood will take advantage of this talented team and put these guys together again soon. Buy the DVD; you won't be disappointed."
2,Dukes of Hazzard?,"I purchased this DVD and just finished watching it. It not often you can go wrong with either Tom Selleck or Sam Elliott. Well this is one case where the directing and the script was so poor that even these two couldn't pull it off. When everyone stinks, it is appropriate to blame the director. The acting by Selleck, Elliot, and the venerable Ben Johnson--was stilted and put on. At the end it struck me that I had been watching an extended version of Dukes of Hazzard, but without cars. Unless you have the opportunity to see this film first, I would highly recommend you not risk your money on it. If you have seen it and this is your cup of tea, then by all means go for it. To each his own."
2,For the bored and lonely.,"If you can enjoy this production you've got too much time on your hands - get out and discover the world and life God created for you.Tom Selleck and Sam Elliot are not expected to act in the movie, just be. Elliot is supposed to bowl over the women by his mere presence and phony, deeply-intoned half-hillbilly voice. Selleck is like a walking Gentleman's Quarterly cover. This is one of those productions made to give certain actors a format to be seen rather than a format in which to labor to give the audience something of enduring value. The plot is credible but the execution of the story-line is for morons. For example, Selleck and Elliot sneaking up on alert sentries from behind; breaking Ben Johnson out of jail and the guards arriving just a moment too late to intervene. This is drivel for imbeciles. Look elsewhere for entertainment. This production should be relegated to the ash bin of history."
2,Good Idea but Not Thought Entirely Through,"This cutting board is great except for two things: the basket isn't very durable and the brackets on the sides are not ""rubberized"" to prevent sliding. Trust me, you don't want the board to shift mid-slice. There are other boards that have the non-slip sides but I haven't found one with a basket this large."
2,"Great Idea, Poor Construction","I got one of these for a wedding present and I absolutely love it. Unfortunately, like another review the wood split although it took 8 months.The basket is handy but can get kind of gross -- to be honest I didn't use it that much and will be shopping for a replacement made of plastic instead of wood, and most likely with no basket."
1,Don't do it,"Spend some more cash on the other one you were looking at, the wood split after one wash.Boo.My tiny kitchen really wanted it to work better."
3,gourmet cutting board,"My first cutting board was damaged and after contacting customer service they sent me a new board and explained how to ship the damaged one back.Everything was great except an email I received that seemed like a threat that they hadn't received the return and were going to charge me for it.Well I didn't understand because I sent the return right away,later I received another email that the return was received.I don,t know if there is tracking numbers on your returns and if there is it would be niceto check instead of sending the customer a threat of charging them for a damaged product thatyou hadn't received yet.That rubbed me the wrong wayBob"
1,Awful. Don't buy.,"Terrible item. Poorly made. The wood on mine split after three uses... and this was moderate use, cutting vegetables, etc. Did not come with a receipt so I couldn't return it if I wanted to.Don't waste your money."
3,Luke The Drifter,This is not a very good display of excellent of a talent this man was. It is okay but there are better CD's out their of him.
5,Hank - Luke the Drifter CD,"This is a fantastic album that is a must for all Hank Williams fans.You will hear songs here that are real, and touching. Who could perform these songs as Hank did? Nobody. Songs like Picture From Life's Other Side, Help Me Understand, Beyond The Sunset, are as relevant now as they were the day they were written. Sung by the Master. Don't deny yourself the opportunity of hearing these masterpieces. They are performances that, once you hear them, you will never forget."
5,Great CD!,This is a great CD. I grew up on this music and I love it! Luke the Drifter is a must have for all Hank Williams Sr fans!
5,Hank's Creative Side Turned Loose,"I discovered this album in my parent's collection when I was a young teen. It's an intensely emotional mix of poetry, recitation and old time country music. It left a deep impression on me and made me forever a Hank Williams fan. Only recently I bought the CD version and was not disappointed. The same feelings came flooding in, mixed with fond memories....."
5,Way Beyond The Sunset...,"This is a fantastic collection, the only problem is...it's too short. The greatest thing about this is that it displays a different side of Hank Williams. No drinking songs here, these are tales of the consequences of the lifestyle of his other side. There are so many great selections here but '' Men With Broken Hearts '' might be the best."
3,Poor Quality,For some reason the copy of Italian Job was very poor quality compared to DVD. I tried it in another Blu Ray player and it had the same issue.
3,Italian Job: Noise and Line in the middle,"There is very snowy noise and a line in the middle of the screen throughout the Italian Job movie. If you don't see it, you may be sitting too far away from the screen, or your screen too dark, or noise reduction from your blu-ray player and your TV are doing good job in suppressing the noise.There is a reason why movies are sold at much reduced prices.On the other hand, both movies are good ones and deserve a second watch in the Hi-Def format if you haven't done so."
5,"The funniest ""Classical"" literature I've read","A bawdy and hilarious tale of maturation and religious transformation - a pagan version of ""The Confessions"" of St. Augustine without the guilt."
5,The Golden Ass: The Transformations of Lucius,"A true classic... A must for any Roman history buff... Anyone who finds an interest in authors such as Juvenal, Catullus, or just appreciate literature that originated in ancient Rome will love this book. Written around the Period called ""Nugae"" this is a true representation of how Rome was changing with the oncoming of Christianity. This book specifically associates with the Egyptian goddess Isis. It follows Rome on it's change from it's traditional belief system to one that accepted many different gods and goddesses. This is a must have for any collection. If you love ancient Rome then you will love this book!"
4,Men behaving badly,"I was waiting for this release for ten years. In overall, I'm please with the product but I'm really missing the subtitles. Therefore only 4 stars."
3,Men Behaving Badly,"It's okay, but could be much better I think.It's very slow in parts, but some are funny in the final analysis I guess."
3,"Rude, Crude and Obnoxious",The title says it all but I love Rob Schneider and will watch anything with him in it.Don't you just hate it when your enjoying a series then they [networks] decided to change [get rid of] actors and put in an actor or actors they think is best for the show. Here is an example of it here after the end of season one. Justine Bateman was a good actor for Rob to play off with and they should have written more stories around them but didn't.If you have a few extra bucks burning a hole in your pocket...pick it up.
5,Perfect for United States Aikido Federation Aikidoists,"This is the book to get if you are practicing in any of the dojos in the United States Aikido Federation. Written by the Shihan of that organization, this book illustrates and describes the techniques that will be tested from (5th Kyu to San Dan) and is a great supplement to work in the dojo. Yamada has also produced DVDs (The Power and the Basics) that are available from the United States Aikido Federation which show him executing the techniques. Both the book and the DVDs contain valuable pointers and instruction on how to correctly perform Aikido techniques. Ultimately of course, the only way to learn any martial art is to practice the techniques over and over again. They must evolve from 'mental knowledge' to 'body knowledge'. That is, you must get to the point where the body executes the techniques without thinking as situations arise. To get to this state, it is essential (particularly for Aikido) to practice with another partner."
1,Warning - this isn't the book that I wrote a summary onbelow,"I found out that the book that most of us recall from our youth is actually called: ""The Hodgepodge Book - an almanac of American folklore"" and was written by Duncan Emrich. It was published by Four Winds Press and copywrited in 1972. Good luck in your searches."
2,No noticeable difference (except the price),"I used a new Static-Master brush for cleaning slides prior to scanning. I tried several different techniques for cleaning my slides, including using a plain soft brush (no polonium). Honestly, I could not tell a difference in the effectiveness of the various cleaning strategies I used. Definitely not worth the extra cost for StaticMaster.Like any brush, this one cleans off loose dust and lint, but does not remove years-old specks that are stuck to the film. The specks are a far greater problem on many of your old slides.Definitely not worth the extra cost for StaticMaster."
2,Not worth the new exorbident Price,"I had been using this product on and off for many years. The most recent I own is a 1"". Worked OK. HOWEVER, when I went to replace the polonium strip, as I had done a number of times in the past, I was shocked at the new price for the strip.I have NOT ordered a new strip.Needless to say, it now resides in the bottom of my gear bad as just another ordinary brush."
3,Nice product,"Nicely laminated, thoughtful cards. I was looking for something inspirational to display in my office (where I work with college-aged students). I feel like these would be more useful in a counselling setting. I do post some of them."
5,Fun and inspiring,"These cards are great. I use them every morning before I do anything else. They offer a positive outlook to begin my day. I have bought several decks to give to friends as gifts, they all loved them too! The cards are brightly colored and beautiful."
3,Too childish & hard to read,"These 2-sided cards have a lot of good inspirational sayings but the illustrations, although colorful, were distracting with handwritten script writing which was very childlike.If you're looking for beautifully illustrated cards that are easy to read I recommend Cheryl Richardson's ""Self-care Cards"" which are very thought provoking & inspirational.Louise Hay's other cards for affirmations were better illustrated & more specific. You can order affirmations for a specific area of your life you want to improve - wealth, romance, self-esteem (more positive about life in general), forgiveness (self-esteem based), job sucess & wisdom."
5,Quick Pick Me Up,"These cards are great for a quick pick me up or uplifting perspective. These cards are colorful with a short statement on one side and a phrase that is more in-depth on the other. Postive and uplifting, these statements can help you refoucs and change your perspective on the day. They are classic Louise Hay, very uplifting, positive, I can do this attitude. I carry these with me in my work bag for those days where I feel negative. I have a few friends and co-workers who have their own set and they use them in different ways; one selects a card and meditates on it, another selects one and carries it with her through the day, another displays it in front of her computer, you can find a way that suits you."
4,Great encouragements!,I keep my cards at my work station at the office so I can see it frequently throughout the day. They keep me focused and remind me of what's really important.
4,Prompt & Pretty,Thank you for sending this item in a prompt fashion. It looked good and will be put to good use.
2,"fun, festive, repetitive","beautiful cards but the affirmations are not varied enough. very repetitive and not so inclusive of more life situations. gorgeous illustrations and very sweet affirmations but many are very similar..could have used more diverse affirmations. see how i wrote these sentences? four ways to say the same thing..the cards kind of do this.... xoxoxo to all folks on the healing path. go veggie for earth, animals and health !!"
5,Keep the cards on your bedside table.,I've known about Louise L. Hay for years. At a point when I was in need of direction and guidance I found the book You Can Heal Your Life. It changed my life and I will never be without a copy of it. I can glance at one of the cards and know how to fix my problem.
4,Great gift,"I got these cards as a gift for a close friend who has several of Ms. Hay's books. The cards were great quality, heavy weight and the pictures/artwork very nice. The affirmations would be good for anyone, not just someone who is familiar with the ""Heal Yourself"" books."
5,these cards are beautiful and inspirational!,"I bought this attractive little box of affirmation cards on a whim, and have been delighted that I did. Whenever I need some direction or a confidence boost or a little 'lift', I shuffle through and just pick a card. The one I end up with is always uncannily accurate and pertinate to my situation at hand. I have since bought several boxes for friends who loved mine. They are bright and cheerful , too, and are a great addition to a coffee table or bookshelf. But, you won't let these get dusty I promise you."
2,Some of his others albums are better,The West Side Story music did not work as well as the Beatles music. I would not recommend it. Try his Beatles music
5,Love It!,We are really enjoying this pump pot. I bought 2 of them to use for different parties we've hosted and they have been wonderful. Drinks are still hot 24 hours later.
3,Looks good,"I got this style birdfeeder because the rats were getting the bird food. This works great keeping rats away, but the birds can't get the food either. I added a couple of wood sticks for the birds to perch on and the rats still can't get the food."
1,I'm with Roberta,"I have five types of feeders in my yard. This is the least popular, both for the birds and for me. Designed to accommodate both perching and clinging birds, it's uncomfortable for both. Perching birds -- those that figure out how to do it -- get into the bowl, ""bathe"" in the seeds, and leave behind unwelcome calling cards. Clinging birds have trouble gaining purchase on the holes provided. They'll grab a seed or two and head off for a ""restaurant"" with better service. I like many Droll Yankee products, but how this one made it to market baffles me."
2,Bird teaser,This product seems to just tease birds. They come to the feeder but cannot figure out how to get to the seed. There in no perch for the perching birds and the other birds cannot figure out how to get into the feeder under the canopy to eat.
3,Only for LITTLE Kids - this is the smaller one than the regular full sized one at most camps,"My slim 4 year old sits in it fine. My 8 year old couldn't even think of squeezing in.These are very popular at most camps, and are really cool little things, but we mistakenly bought this model for our 8 year old and it didn't work."
3,Not a very exciting read,This book was not a very exciting read. The fact that it was written in the first person from both of the characters was very confusing. I constantly had to switch gears. Emotions of the characters were not fully explored. I was expecting a more romantic read.
4,Yes I would like cheese with that!,"Not by any means suffering from ""Sophomore Slump"" this release actually takes the party attitude from the first album, but removes the crappy keyboard sounds and adds much more guitar. It also sounds like they actually meant it on this album. If you have any doubts about the talent, check out ""Puppet Show."" Timmons is a SMOKIN' guitarist. All in all, this one really hits the mark, combining the party cheese of the first release with the darker, edgier sound of their later releases."
4,Still enjoyable,"I'm not as crazy aboutn this one as their first album, but it's great nonetheless. Defintiely wortht he cash if you like hair band music. I really enjoyed this album in the day and still play it now and then now."
3,good but not as classic as their first cd,"this is a good cd, but the songs are not as catchy or as memorable as the ones in their debut cd. Nevertheless, fans will be satisfied with this product and casual listeners will get a taste of what this band is capable of."
3,"Worthy Followup? Nah, ""Screw it!""","When Danger Danger's first album debuted, I was hooked. It was one of those rare albums with great tunes pretty much all the way through. With that in mind, I looked forward to the follow-up (""Screw It!"") and was really disappointed. The quality of the songs just didn't hold up to the previous album. ""Screw it!"" falls prey to the dreaded ""sophmore curse"" - pass it up."
2,Still the Same,"I listened to this album again recently after purchasing when it came out. Even for this type of music it came across as way to cliched for the time and still sounds overtly juvenile. This was the final straw for a mate of mine who went from glam to death as a result. Still, they sound good and with a slightly different lyrical approach may have been bigger. A parody of the genre but no one told them."
5,The Precious Garland of the Dharma of the Birds,"This lovely book contains the English translation of a 300 years old Tibetan text, The Precious Garland of the Dharma of the Birds. This piece of Tibetan folk literature tells us about the Buddha of Compassion taking the form of a cuckoo to teach the birds the Dharma. The book has been reprinted in India by Motilal Banarsidass Publishers, including Chinese illustrations of birds. Just search ISBN 8120801989."
5,I absolutely loved this book,"I read this book a while back, when it first came out in print, and I still have the tattered copy on my bookshelf. This book is an awesome insight into a new way of thinking about life.I have read this book a few times and I even purchased it as a gift for a couple of others. If you're looking to relax, find some joy in life, and attain true balance, this is your guide."
5,Very happy with book and seller,"Helpful guide to aikido basics and more practical complement to Aikido and the Harmony of Nature (also an excellent book).I continue to be impressed with my Amazon Marketplace seller purchases. This one came in nearly perfect condition, shrink-wrapped and boxed as though it was new."
1,Nitty indeed,"This is awful. It doesn't even deserve the single star I was forced to give under this rating scale.Rap is about spoken word, and in the absence of vocal melody, the performer should hope to have at least tone and/or diction - Nitty has neither, and in the parts of this track where he attempts to sing, you soon realise that he isn't up to scratch on that skill either.This isn't art, not even entertainment. It merely serves as an ad for ostentatious bling-bling toting slack jaws without the merest slice of original thought."
3,The secret to getting rich.,"You want to know how to get rich? I'll tell you right now. Step one: become a billionaire. Step two: establish the smallest crumb of credibility in the public by having your own TV show. Step three: write a self-help book and sell it to the average Joe Sucker who thinks that he can get rich by buying a book that some other rich guy wrote. If you want to skip steps one and two, you may be able to still accomplish step three, but it's not advised."
1,ODE TO A POMPOUS WIND BAG,"Jesus, what a narcassist, I mean is this guy for real. Why do people buy into this idiot with the ridiculous comb over; the emperor has no clothes, people! The only reason he has any money is because the banks could not afford to call in his notes, he had such staggering debt, he would have sunk the bank..id love to know what his net worth really is..but you have to give the guy credit he does know how to get press, and his spawn seen to be a chip off the old comb over, they are as arrogant and frankly unattractive as he is, though i must admit his new child is a really cute kid...maybe a paternity test is in order. How to get rich...drive up ur debt to such a level, and owe so many creditors that they cannot afford to call in your debt..priceless."
4,Trump's view of things,"The book is interested, but the title is misleading. It provides you with vivid information about Donald Trump's views, beliefs and values, but tells little how to get rich. The best books that I've read about getting rich are Robert Kiyosaki's ""Rich Dad Poor Dad"", ""The Millionaire Next Door"" by Thomas Stanley and ""Transforming debt into wealth"" by John Cummuta. Both of three works above mentioned, although are written in completely different manner, style and by different people, share the same main goal: the importance of assets and the burden of liabilities. This is the essence of getting rich. It's always easier to create assets than to purchase them. How would you create assets then? There are many ways. There is a book ""The Ten Roads to Riches"" by Ken Fisher that I recommend."
2,Trump Forgets a Basic Rule of Economics,"The fact that he doesn't read his own work takes a star off. Barry Bostwick is good, but no one can deliver like the author. I like the CD, I like his edge; though he drops names like a socialite. It's gets pretty dumb after awhile.The last 1 1/2 CDs are just a week in the life... Back by popular demand??? At the suggestion of Mark Brunell (sp?) the Apprentice drama farce. Thought it was a good show until the little ""manipulation"" where the guy ""magically"" comes in to rent the space 5 minutes before the deadline and beats the other team. I hope the show dies the death it deserves. Donald use to be about integrity, now he's mixed up with hollywood and it won't do him any good.The more you're out there Donald, the less we want to see. We like it when you came out, once in a great while. We valued the time with you. Now you're everywhere and yawn.....zzz...Don't waste your money... Buy mine!"
1,Pearls of financial Wisdom....?,"One word for this publication of total crap is garbage. Some of the stuff included here are things like don't shake hands because you may get germs. Dont buy cheap suits because they wear out faster,and dont go to an interview in New York city dressed like a cowboy... Complete and utter dreck..."
3,Classic Trump,"If you've read ""The Art of the Deal"", you know what to expect from The Donald: A lot of bragging and egomaniacal attitude. But at the same time, reading ""How to Get Rich"" is like listening to a good salesmen. You may not believe everything he is saying, but it sure is fun to listen to. This book had some overlap from ""The Art of the Deal"" but the tips are all good - and very general. You are not going to find the inner-workings of financing a real estate endeavor. Nonetheless, if you're a fan of ""The Apprentice"" and the The Donald's past work, you'll enjoy this quick read."
1,"Trash, garbage, trash, waste, worthless","first how to get rich, by working hard no question about that. i liked the first couple of pages. it talks about passion, ambition and focus, key ingredients to succeed. the rest is trash. if u take away the pictures the douple spacing and the empty space it is less than 60 pages. i dont know waht else to say i can write a better book."
3,Trump is fun as always,Trump has written many books and I think this is one of his more disappointing efforts. The book contains many great tips that can be gotten out of any run of the mill business book. It lacks the Trump style of straight talk and is really Donald showing his ego on most of the pages. Stick to Art of the Deal if you want to see classic Trump giving good original advice. If you are a fan of the Donald though you won't find this book to disappointing.
2,"Get focused, Donald...","Despite the ""How to..."" title, I couldn't find a coherent theme or useful information in this book. He spends a lot of time bragging about his TV appearance, personal helicopter, and attacking his enemies - who cares?Sections on money & business - the reason I bought this - only contained general, uninspiring advices.I feel that he (or his staff) scribbled this book without much thoughts.If you want to learn how to get rich, I'd rather recommend the ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" over this. Kiyosaki is not a triumphant celeb-billionaire like Trump, but at least he gave me newer insights into several business matters.Unless Trump's narcissistic stories fascinate you, don't waste your money."
1,I was forced to give at least 1 star,"I would have given 0 stars if given the opportunity. This book should not be titled ""How To Get Rich"", because the buyer may actually think that is what the book is about. Instead the book should be titled ""How a Rich Man Feels About Himself"" Trump's only advise is really common sense. He does not tell the reader how to get rich but more so how he (an already rich man) doesn't shake hands to avoid germs, drinks diet cokes, talks on the phone all day (making deals - which of course is not elaborated on)and reads newspapers and magazines. If you want to know a little bit about Trump's life, this book is for you. If you want to know how to get rich, find another book."
2,Definition of narcissism -A good laugh-but self serving,"The title is misleading. The title made me think, I would learn how to grow my networth. Trump should have more appropriately called it; How I was rich, and leveraged myself to more wealth, for now. Trump is a huge risk taker. The average person could easily lose all with employing the same risk taking that Trump does.Trump is SO egotistical that he doesn't tune into the average reader at all.It's quite self serving that he says you could make as much money on the roulette wheel as the stock market. Both are risky, but investing in companies is much different than gambling on a roulette wheel.His advice about a prenup may have worked for his lifestyle, but hopefully most people want a real partnership.His advice about screaming expletives on the phone is odd.I did laugh out loud. That has some value."
2,Not a useful book,This book isn't going to be useful for someone looking to use it as a guide to get rich. I doubt Donald Trump even wrote this book. It reads like a book written by a ghost writer giving out simple cliches with no actual substance behind them. Very dissapointing.
1,Anything for a buck,"This book is not a how to book, nor is it an autobiography--its an expensive advertisement. Donald probably spent an hour writing this. Reading this book one could see re-writes from his previouis books ""how to make a deal""--Endorsements for his friends like Tony Robbins(who paid him millions to do speeches), and the apprentice.Thoroughly worthless."
2,The Rosetta Stone...not,"I have to give Donald Trump credit for making a 'comeback' in the current media culture where contempt for the audience is the number one prerequisite. And to top it off, he gives us another impressive tome to add to his collection of 'work'.You can get a good chuckle and also pick up amazing, hitherto unmentioned business advice from 'The Donald', who appears to have forgotten the first step to getting rich: being born rich, of course.Donald also pokes fun at himself by writing about that copper-hued thing on his head, then waxing on further about points so profound I forgot them on my way to the door of the bookstore.Recommended if you think being on TV is a sign of great success in your life, or if you believe that getting rich can be learned from a book."
2,Not what the title suggests.....,"The simplistic title of the book and knowing who the author is, should have been a tip-off that this was not what I was buying. I actually bought it out of curiosity and interest in a very unique and accomplished man. The book, however, is primarily about his organization, his (very general) principles of management and his (also very general) history of his career. It is an interesting read only if you like chatty, superficial books about someone else and their business empire. I will say, however, that if you haven't read any of his other books, it does give the reader an insight into how Trump thinks, his family, and in general, an overview of his lifestyle. The two stars is partly because I do not like misleading titles."
1,A mere form of self-promotion,"I enjoyed The Apprentice and admire Donald Trump very much, but How to Get Rich is really just a bragging account of how wealthy Donald Trump really is and how many material things he possesses. Trump is one smart cookie. The publisher paid him lavishly for the book and Trump gives common sense tips that anyone in business could have given. The thing I enjoyed most about the book is that although he can be aggressive and blunt, his feelings can be hurt easily. I wouldn't mind having Trump as a personal friend, but I'd certainly wouldn't want to be his enemy. There's honesty in the book, and I give him that credit."
5,Excellent Resource for Information on Business,"As they say, give a man a fish he'll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish, he'll eat a lifetime. That's exactly what The Donald is doing with any of his books, teaching and instructing. I found this book to have some very good points and traits in it to which I'm implementing in my daily life. If you're looking for a get rich quick scheme, this isn't the book for you. If you're looking for ways to approach business and deals and necessary tools for daily life, read this book."
1,Top in Real Estate,"Every time this guy comes back from the dead, you can bet on a top in real estate. Look, I know this guy came back from being down 9 billion or so, but guess what? He got lucky. The banks didn't call in his loans because they couldn't!This time, the bursting of the American real estate bubble will take him out for good, and it's going to be ugly. His casinos are already going down the tubes. Time for a haircut Mr. Trump, literally and figuratively.Art of the Deal was a great book. Unfortunately, this one is 90% hot air. When he schleps a stupid spot for Verizon, you know it's over."
1,income=human worth?,"Yes, of course this book is better than all the other books out there, because DONALD MAKES MORE MONEY! Donald Trump is obviously a better writer than Shakespeare and God put together! (They obviously needed better agents) Just like Jay Leno is a better artist than Van Gogh and Michaelangelo, because money is always the ultimate indicator of quality! And needless to say, Donald is a better person than a million 9-11 firefighters any day! Get a clue, morons!"
2,How to get $15 richer: don't buy this book!,"If you've read *any* of Donald Trump's previous books (especially ""The Art of the Deal"" and ""The Art of the Comeback"") which were surprisingly fascinating, you're going to HATE this book. It's not worth your money, especially if you've read ""The Art of the Comeback"", which was an excellent book.If you've never read a book by Donald Trump before, I would recommend his book, titled ""The Art of the Deal"" (which is coincidentally available on Amazon.com right now).I gave this book two stars because there are a few things in this book that can't be found in his earlier editions: updated pics of his children; info on his new girlfriend Melania; and a new section on ""The Apprentice."" Otherwise, everything else in the book is material that is regurgitated from his previous books.For someone who values high quality work, I'm shocked that he placed his name on this book."
2,Mildly Entertaining,"Donald Trump, more than being a businessman, is an entartainer and a very capable one-product marketing machine, where the product is Donald Trump.This books offers some common sense business advice on how to deal with employees, competitors etc. but is completely lacking any specifics on his real estate deals.The only thing which I thound mildly entertaining is his constant bragging in regards to his achievements, his friends in high places (Melanie griffith, Regis Philbin) and his hate for doctors. The only memorable advice was in regards to marriage where ""The Donald"" states: ""Get a prenuptial agreement""."
2,You're fired!,"Yes Donald, you're fired! This book is endless parade of Donald Trump, the Donald Trump, the Great Donald Trump and his shenanigans. You will learn more about the Donald Trump persona, the Donald Trump attitude. Which is a plus for every millionaire in the making and wanna-be billionaire. The Donald Trump's larger than life multi billionaire attitude and view of life is great. But what about the original purpose of this book:""How to get rich!""; nothing or very least. A lot about his personal hatred and his awful trademark hair. But nothing about his beginning and about what he did to become the mainstream billionaire that he is.Unfortunately for us, this book is just a parade of shameless self-promotion. Nothing we can relate to."
3,"FUN TO READ, BUT THAT'S IT","Donald Trump is many things, but he's not much of an author, I'm afraid. Yes, I enjoyed reading this book. It was fun, had interesting anecdotes, and let me delve into the mind of America's top business celebrity... but only so far. There was nothing in the book that would actually qualify as business expertise. The Donald simply gives a lot of his own opinions, intermixed with personal stories. I was hoping for more, but not really surprised to get less.Was the book fun to read? Yes. Was it easy and quick to read? Definitely. Did I learn how to get rich? Of course not."
1,"How to Get Rich: Save your money, don't buy this book","Having been disappointed in Trump: The Art of the Deal, I should not have been so quick to purchase this book. I read it all in a few hours, hoping learn strategies and the like. I was shocked to see that he devoted a chapter to identifying people he doesn't like. In addition, he has a section outlining the phone calls and activities of a normal week, which was boring and came across as bragging. Unfortunately, this book is a loser. If you are curious, borrow it--it is not worth the money."
1,The King of the Blowhards...,"There is not one word about how one gets ""rich."" He seems to write a book every so often to launch into more self admiration and promotion. Trump has so be the biggest blowhard of the century. Inheriting a huge sum of money with real estate attached is certainly a great way to get rich.It will be interesting to watch what happens with his financially troubled casinos.I have admired many great business people during my life who have done amazing things. I do not admire nor aspire to be anything like Donald Trump. I will never waste another dime on one of his ""books"". I would imagine that his greatest piece of advice should be ""pick your parents well"".What would Trump have done just starting from scratch like anyone else? My guess is that we wouldn't be reading any of his worthless books."
5,Your business mentor,"If you want to succeed in business (or in any worthy endeavor)this book is the closest most of us will ever get to having Donald Trump as a personal mentor.Think about it - how could you not want to read what one of the most creative, successful, and influential entrepreneurs of our time has to say about what it takes to WIN BIG?Written in Trump's trademark straightforward - don't beat around the bush - style, this will be a welcome read for all who want to achieve the best in life."
1,What I expected,"Picked this off a book shelf and read the first 20 pages and flipped through the rest. Snore... Not surprising that it's not really some get rich bible to have on your desk. Donald has never intrigued me much and it didn't shock me that his book didn't either. If you need practical advice at how to manage your finances and improve your people skills you won't find it from a guy who was $9 billion in debt and is one of the most unpleasant people to listen to. He most likely dictated 30 pages of this book to his ""two beautiful assistants"" one afternoon and they filled in the rest when he left for Europe to find another wife."
2,Trump's memoirs - not a guide to get rich,"I was deceived by the title of this book. The first four parts are somewhat interesting. The later half was more about Trump, his family, his weekly routine etc., (Hmmm... Who wants to know all these?!)If you are looking for some good tips to get rich, don't waste your time in reading this book."
2,The title of this book is very misleading!,"I'm sorry to say that this book does not give me any real insight in how to do better real estate deals. The book would have been brilliant if the title was simply ""My Ego"". It's like a mini-autobiography that just covers his prime. Then by the end it turns into an infomercial for his TV show. I don't know if I want to even consider reading ""The Art of the Deal"" because if it anything at all like this book, it is mislabeled and will not truly help me make better real estate decisions. The only thing this book gives me is leverage in a Trump watercooler/dinner discussion. That's about it. :("
1,"Daddy ""Warbucks""","Wow what a story! Who could think that in America, one man all by himself could could take his fathers fortune and actually add to it! Hey who cares if he went bankrupt and blackmailed the banks into bailing him out. He is a true pop icon. An insperation for young men and women everywhere."
2,bad,"this books gives no advice on how to make money, it's all about blablablabla ..... it's a waste!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I think we can all agree that donald trump is many thing but certainly not a good author !"
1,Written in a day,This book was obviously written very quickly in an attempt to capitalize on the success of the Apprentice. It has very little substance and nearly all of his advice is common sense. The Donald could put his name on a list of Twinkie ingredients and some people would rave.
1,No 1 Gives You the Knowledge-it is all a fake.,"There is no way that some one who is rich will give you his or her secrets as to how he or she made wealth. This is like Cliff Swain telling you how to defeat him in Racquetball. I like the apprentice shows, but ""the donald"" will never do that. First of all no one does that...no one does it, it is all a fake."
1,"""Hey Donnie Baby, Guess What? You're Fired!""","What a ""HAM"" in every sense of the word! Donald Trump you and your advice are really something..Full of SHI_! How in God's Green Acres can you look in the mirror each and every day knowing all the money you have made and gone through! When is enuff...enuff? You are too much, honestly! Shameless Extreme. Young women, tons of money, and you're still unhappy and don't know what to do with yourself or your sad pathetic life. Why don't you take some of the zillions dollars you have and do some good with it for a change, there are millions of poor in the USA that need a helping hand. Just a thought!"
1,More like how to be a fraudster !,"So let me get this straight. Donald Trump, who himself has gotten into deep financial trouble but is able to host his fraudulent tv show ""The Apprentice"" only because he was bailed out and because the media moguls love his libertarian leanings, wants to preach about how to get rich ? If you want to be another fraudster like Trump, then go ahead and read this book and see if you can be as lucky to somehow slip through some crack or two."
5,Good book,"The Art of the Deal is still my favorite Trump book but this one was good as well. It had good advice about making it in the corporate world but didn't focus a lot about building his business. From an entrepreneural point of view, I preferred Stop Working by Rohan Hall. How to Get Rich is filled however with lots of essentials that everyone would find valuable."
1,Zero star if there was such a category,"I borrowed this book from my local library, because honestly I was entertained by Trump's earlier books. I was curious to see what pearls of wisdom the Donald had to impart to all his minions out there. I am glad I didn't have to spend a dime to buy this piece of rubbish which passes off as a ""book"". After skimming through a number of pages and chapters (many just a few pages long), I realise the man is really a loser, and so would the person who buys it."
2,"gee thanks, don","Let's see -- how to get rich, in the manner of Donald Trump:1) Be born into a family with lots of money to begin with.2) Get lots of tax cuts from a beleaguered New York City government.3) Get the banks to bail you out when you overextend yourself.4) Promote yourself like mad.5) Bend or ignore any laws that don't suit you.If Theodore Dreiser were alive today, he'd be writing books about this grandstander."
1,Im so sick of Donald Trump.,"What a sellout. Get off the air, your making me sick. No seriously, you make me want to crap myself."
3,Mediocre Book,"Donald Trump's book ""How To Get Rich"" is a bit misleading. It's more of a book that just states some common sense ideas. While there certainly is some merit to the ideas, none of them are really new and most of them are things that work for him, but not necessarily for other people.I enjoyed the parts of the book where he talks about what he goes through in a typical day, and the types of habits he keeps. Reading about the type of material he reads and how much time he spends on learning was very interesting for me.However, Mr. Trump doesn't get into a lot of details. Some of his advice (Find the right assistant, Be patient) was just plain simple. He would have been better off explaining how to implement these ideas or how one could gain insight into this advice.That said, if you want to learn more about Mr. Trump, this would be a good book for you. But if you are just looking for specific advice about how to get rich, look somewhere else. 3 out of 5 stars."
1,How to get rich? Don't spend money on this book!,"There's one way that Trump didn't menion in his book that can make you more money...don't waste yours on this book! What a waste of time to read. Trump does 3 things in this book: 1) Stoke his own massive ego; 2) advertise, advertise, advertise(for himself); and 3) enact vengance against those he dislikes (holding grudges is actually listed in the book as one of his secrets to getting rich. Sure. Whatever.) Nothing in here will help anyone make a dime of money.I'm a huge fan of the show, which is why I bought this book. But it's a waste of time and money. Don't bother.There was one humorous thing I found in the book. He must discuss 5 times in the book the attention he pays to detail, even so far as if the door handles in his building are polished. He must not have done the same for the book itself though as there is a typo on page 217! Gimme a break."
1,Trump should use his name to sell lemons!,Donald Trump would be an ideal salesperson for any used car dealership! This book is crap! Full of common sense and arrogance! What a waste of $21.95
3,Thin gruel,"Trump is a fascinating character and great at being a celebrity. He's a big believer in the American Dream, and one can't fault him for that. This book is interesting if you approach it wanting to hear his voice in your head and get a little inspiration to keep moving and working toward your own dreams. If you're looking for specific advice or detailed plans, go elsewhere. This is not a book for deep thoughts."
2,Waste of Money!,"I gather that the only reason he wrote the book was to collect a bunch of money from people who believe he has credibility in making money (which he does). However, he didn't turn out a very good book. In fact, it offered no specific information on helping anyone get rich. Each chapter named something off like pertaining to business in his world like ""Having Patience for the Deal"" and ""Always Have Them By the Balls."" Nonsense like that. He even had a chapter at the end about his hair style. I was very disappointed and felt cheated. If he was going to write a book, he could have at least offered some legitimate information instead of something half-assed to make himself even richer. He should have called the book: ""How I Get Rich By Selling a Crappy Book to People."""
4,"Darling, I Love You, but Give Me Park Avenue!","I'm wondering if the people who've panned this book are: angry with themselves for not doing anything with their lives; for not doing ""their thing"" to the best of their ability; or if they're one of these people who have suddenly realized they live in an armpit of America and resent ""big city folk.""Also, a word to Floyd of North Carolina: Your money would have been better spent in purchasing the latest edition of the Merriam-Webster Dictionary and a copy of ""Strunk and White's.""Oh, but the book! I enjoyed it simply because I'm interested in what makes successful people tick. At times, I do think Trump is obnoxious and stuck in an 80's mindset, but I also feel he's earned the right. Would you be shuffling down 5th Avenue with your head down if you were in his shoes?"
4,I loved it,"This is the book we have all been waiting for. While there are plenty of books written by millionaires, unfortunately too many by paper tigers with no real world experience, a few by billionaires, how many are written by a billionaire with a hot tv show with the status of Donald Trump? The one and only!Regarding critics, Mr. Trump addresses this in his book (for those of us who have actually read it. I doubt if any of the one stars reviewers have read it) Are they really worth worrying about? I doubt it. If they were successfulthey would be out doing some deals themselves not in front of a pc day and night bashing good books and highly successful people like Mr. Trump.Great book Mr. Trump. I am looking forward to your next foray!"
1,Should be how to get BORED!,"There is nothing in here that will help you get rich. You will hear lots of stories about how great his hotels and golf courses are, according to him. You will hear gossip (its titled that!) and a section devoted to his hair! Don't waste your time or money, this book is an insult! Trump, you're fired! and get rid of that hair!"
4,A Good Book,"This book is a good read. However, it felt a drop short of the previous books that Trump wrote. Many of the lessons were repetitive from the previous books. Nevertheless, I still feel that there is something to gain for everyone even if you only skim it quickly.I recommend this book to everyone after you read his first two books. '"
1,Shallow,"The advice and the author of this book are both very shallow. It was interesting to get a peek into how a billionaire lives. However, the book is very shallow, more of ""who I love and who I hate"" than a real dispenser of knowledge. The font is huge and this book could have easily been fitted into a third of the number of pages that it actually uses. I felt like he was meeting some publisher's requirement of pages by using a huge font.Trump strikes me as a really shallow person in this book. And his advice is also very shallow. It is sort of an interesting, amusing and quick read, but certainly not worth the money it costs as the advice is pathetic."
3,"Not his best work, but enjoyable","Trump is one of my guilty pleasures. He's so full of himself that it seems contagious.The Art of the Deal is his best piece, by far. The trouble is, the man is almost a living cartoon character with his larger-than-life means, attitude, and hairdo. Because of his comic book-like nature, I find myself curious about the further exploits of the man I met in Art of the Deal.I'd give it more stars, but this particular episode of Trump isn't quite worth a full 4. I would recommend his other one, The Art of the Comeback. Killer book with his killer attitude after near bankruptcy. Hope this helps...hehehe..."
4,Hard to argue with success.... failure.... and success.,"Say what you want about Trump. The bottom line is that he has managed to make some amazing successes in the face of some amazing failures. Anyone who can do that is worth listening to when it comes to business.This book is a how to in only the broadest of terms. The gives some good words to live by - not everything he has to say is a pure nugget of wisdom, but still worthing hearing out.The cadence of the writing was a bit funky, but then it seemed to mimic the cadence of Trumps speaking. Maybe its a New Yorker thing. ;-)"
3,Trump at his best - being Trump,"This is a book about what Trump likes to do best and that is to talk about Trump. That means that those who want to get another look inside of Trump's world will enjoy it. Also there are a few points on how he sees business that are worth the read. It is an easy read that should not take more than a couple days to complete. If you are looking for deep advice on business, do not purchase this book. However, if you are looking for an enjoyable read with some good points to consider, this is your book."
3,"Decent, not great","This book is more about Donalds life than about how to ""Get Rich"". Getting Rich IS part of his life, however, it seems like he goes off on tangents about things he wants you to know that are not really related to getting rich. For example, he talks about holding a grudge against Mario Cuomo. I don't blame him for holding a grudge but what does that have to do with getting rich? This is just one example of many digressions. Donald should write an autobiography if he wants to put his general thoughts into a book. The amount of useful information is small compared to the amount of print that's in the book."
3,"some pearls and wisdom, but title is a misnomer","Overall I liked the book and I am not particularly a fan of Mr. Trump. However he has had good times and not so good times personally and professionally. I think there are a lot of pearls and wisdom scattered through the book about dealing with life. The book is really not How to Get Rich,but about certain lessons he has learned about the ups and downs of his life. It is an easy read, a lot of short chapters. Buy the book and donate it to the library when you are done with it."
2,Donald Trump got ya....,"The book was pretty plain and gave really no insight into what it is titled. The book should have been named more appropriately. A name like ""Trump, everday life as a CEO"" might have been better. Yes, he gave tips on how to get rich, but his tips are more like what he needs to be everyday in order to maintain his position as CEO and maintain his wealth.This book was very easy reading and the concepts are something a 4 year old can grasp. I guess I should have read ""Art of the Deal"" (which to my understanding got much better reviews, than this book)."
2,Trump,"Took one day to read this book, each chapter is extremely short (about 3-5 pages each). The title of this book does not reflect its content. It should be called The Basics of Managing a Company. Other advise that is given (eg. On Investing) Trump states ""Invest Wisely"". He doesn't tell you what to invest in or how to do it. If you want to learn how to get rich, one is better off buying a book by Suze Orman, because this one fails completely. It is clear that this book took advantage of the show The Apprentice because the timing seems right for Trump to get back on top."
2,poor book,"i though this book wasnt that great, the esssence was that he is rich and made it from scratch.robert kiwasaki books are much better"
1,How to get rich.,Write how to get rich books.The only ones who will ever get rich off of books like this are the authors. Still it's fun to read.
5,Interesting,"I bought the book because I followed The Apprentice and I like to find out what makes rich and successful people, well, rich and successful. After reading it, I'm not sure I learned quite enough to make myself either, but I did enjoy the tidbits about the Apprentice. So I recommended checking it out.Oh, and call me crazy, but I like The Donald's hair the way it is."
1,you can get better tips from an indian hooker,"hey!heres a way to get rich, dont buy the god damn bookmr ""im so cool"" mr ""trump-inator"" the ""donald""you know what mr trump, YOUR FIRED!!!! AHHHHH...AHHHHHHHH!!"
3,Not that complicated,Want to know how to get rich? Start with millions in capital and invest in real estate. It's fool proof
3,SHOCKED!,"As the webmaster and creator of the ultimate Miss Universe pageant fan (www.missuniversecritic.com), I read the book because I wanted to more about Trump as the owner of Miss Universe. Trump speaks much about perfection, however, the book is hardly perfect. Imagine my horror when I saw a photo of Trump, along with the judges for the 1999 Miss Universe pageant and the winner herself, Mpule Kwelagobe of Botswana. However, when you read the caption underneath the photo, it says that the winner's name is ""Wendy Fitzwilliam"" who happens to be Mpule's predecessor! When the Donald finds out about this major boo-boo, I can't wait for him to tell his researcher: ""You're fired!"" Then the Donald calls me up to say: ""Rafael, you're hired!"" Hee-hee!"
1,Not worth it,"This book reminds me of two things:1 - Students who put together a quick, sloppy paper just to meet an assignment deadline. I think ""The Apprentice"" window dictated a deadline for publishing this book. I suspect that Mr. trump will one day look back at this book and say ""I can't believe that I put my name on this thing""2 - Late night TV commercials with ""Send me $30.00 and I will show you how to get rich."" I don't know anybody who got rich doing it that. I suspect no body will get rich reading this book either.The content is mostly self-promoting, lacks any cohesion and sometimes not worth remembering for one minute. Mr. Trump takes a whole ""chapter"" advising people to stop shaking hands because he doesn't like it. How will that advice make anybody rich? That is just an example of how silly this book is. For full disclosure, I didn't finish reading the book. It was simply not serious and certainly not worth the time."
1,The art of the rip-off............,"I want my money back. This book is total garbage. It is nothing more than a collection of the same stories told from ""the art of the comeback""(which was a decent book), along with some new material about the TV show. I could have saved my money and just read ""the art of the comeback"" one more time. This version is just a shameless attempt to capitalize on the success of ""the apprentice"". I have read every one of Donald Trump's books, and always enjoyed them. This was a major disappointment from someone whom I have idolized over the years.The only ones who can get rich from this book are Donald Trump and his publisher. Save your money."
2,This books sucks,"When is everyone going to learn - there is no such thing as a how-to-get-rich book. The title for the book is a joke itself. Trump and his editors were probably laughing all the way to the bank when they thought of the title. Seriously, if anybody knows the secret on how to get rich, why would he tell you? This book is nothing more than a ploy to get some extra dough by capitalizing on the success of The Apprentice. There is so much white space in the book because there is not much writing in terms of quantity or quality! The advice is so mundane. Half of the book is memoirs of a week as Trump - boooring. And I don't want to read about the show in the last chapter. I cannot believe this book was published. The writing stinks and there is even some typos. Trump may produce quality buildings, but that cannot be said of his books."
