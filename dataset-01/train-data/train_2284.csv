3,lost in melancholy,"A very melancholic memoir that at times seems to get lost in a not there not here, not east not west time and space ! somewhat interesting but not very compelling"
2,Love the city but not the book,"I visited Istanbul twice and can still see, hear, smell and feel the vibrancy of this exotic, magnificent city. I eagerly anticipated reading this book. Disappointedly, I found this author's lifelong experiences to be melancholy and his writings meandering. His reflections and observances offer a few beautiful moments but those moments are not worth the tedious read."
5,wonderful and evocative,"I found this truly wonderful and evocative in many ways--a place I had never been and always wondered about, history I knew only dimly, a way of life I hadn't imagined, how they changed from long before the author was born until he reached 50, and the feelings of a bright and sensitive child growing up there. The pictures are a great addition and would be truly miraculous if they could be larger and clearer than they are in the paperback. I could not find out whether they are better in the hard-back."
4,Istanbul from an unexpected vantage point.,"Pamuk's view of Istanbul as a city dominated by melancholy seems strange at first, but understandable once he explains how he sees the city's relationship to the present as intertwined irrevocably with its past."
4,Orhan Pamuk's Experience of Istanbul,"Orhan Pamuk, winner of the 2006 Nobel Prize in Literature, writes of the history of Istanbul and of his personal experience of it growing up in the 50s through the 70s. I read ""Istanbul"" and three other Pamuk novels as background for an upcoming trip to Turkey.Pamuk is a somewhat challenging author, but you will find yourself rewarded for your persistence."
3,Beautiful but slow moving,"I wanted to love this book. However, I found myself wanting to be more engaged with the characters. I wasn't crazy about it."
2,Not Very Dreamy,"I had high hopes for this book based on the other reviews. I am sorry that I bought it. I tried to like it. I couldn't get into the story & I could barely read it. I didn't find it very inspirational or able to ""carry me away."" I'd say that you should borrow it from your library or purchase it used for very low cost instead of regretting paying full price like me."
4,Contente!,"Bague très jolie, plus fine que sur la photo mais je suis très contente de cet achat! De plus elle m'a été livrée très rapidement en seulement 4 jours."
5,in my opinion m. brecker is the best sax soloist alive,track four and five are simply amazing; m. brecker is a prophet
2,Great band crappy dvd,"I'm a huge cannibal corpse fan and have seen them many times. And in my opinion this dvd takes away the amazing experience that is a cannibal corpse show. The sound and picture on this dvd was so bad it gave me a headache,the only part i enjoyed was the three songs from poland. I was upset for spending the $25 dollars, im just not impressed with bootlegs i guess. If you like bootleg style videos then this is the one for you. But I highly recommend LIVE CANNALBALISM over this one, the sound and picture blows this dvd out of the water."
5,LONG LIVE CANNIBAL CORPSE!,This video is for people who may not of ever seen cannibal corpse show live. Buy this you will not be sorry!
3,this could be better,"I must say that i was dissapointed when i bought this album. I bought it because of the title song. Wicked Game is a great song but next three song after Wicked Game are terrouable . But it's not that bad. Heart Full Of Soul and Blue Hotel are also very good songs. But the rest of the songs are not too catchy. The only thing i like on this album is mood:guitar,beach,dreaming and sleeping. I would give to this album 2 and 1/2 stars...or maybe 3 but i'm not sure. Not bad, but also not too good."
5,Wicked Games by Chris Isaak,"This is my first Chris Isaak cd. I really like most of the songs. Most especially ""Wicked Games"". There are always a couple of songs on any cd that are not my favorite. I will be buying more of his music."
4,Can someone help me find an episode?,"I collected many VHS sets of The Twilight Zone many years ago, but have not been able to find an episode I viewed many years ago. In this particular episode a woman finds a box buried in a flower bed, inside the box is a clock or watch (details on a little fuzzy on some of this). With the clocks magical power everything comes to a stop whenever she yells out ""SHUT UP"". Then once she claps her hands everything resumes as normal. It ends as the family is huddled together listening to the news on a radio of a nuclear bomb is headed to their city. The woman can't deal with this and yells SHUT UP. At this point everything stops, she goes outside and sees the bomb right above her home. It ends with her in this quandary of what she should do. If anyone can remember the name of this episode I would greatly appreciate it, this and Talking Tina were my favorite episodes. Thanks!"
5,"This one deserves to be ""discovered""","I first read this book when I was in the Peace Corps in 1993. I had grabbed it off the shelf of ""used books"" in the PC office one day, on a whim, thinking it was light enough to carry around in a knapsack for a 2 week vacation. Once I started reading it, I was captivated! Having reread it several times since then, I never fail to be drawn into the story. It is one of the most finely crafted, joyous stories I have ever read. I see one of the other fans made some movie casting suggestions: I would agree with his choices, except I would prefer Harrison Ford as Raleigh and Ray Walston as his father. Kathleen Turner as Aura and John Goodman as Mingo would be perfect. Read it! You won't be disappointed!"
3,If only Malone built compelling plot,"Malone is a great Southern writer. I've read through parts of two or three of his books, and his take on the South is perfect---some of his characters are so authentically Southern I'm tempted to think I've met them somewhere. He is also very funny. I began reading his books and was entertained for maybe 100 pages or so. Then, to my chagrin, I began losing interest. I lectured myself: ""This is great Southern writing. You are entertained. It got great reviews. Read on."" But the plot had not grabbed me. There was nothing compelling I wanted to find out, no conflict, no secret, no great struggle to be resolved. I believe that this may possibly be why, as some reviewers stated, that Malone is still a best kept secret. Maybe I'll pick up Handling Sin and try again."
5,"One of the best books ever, take it from an English Major!","How can this book have only 1 or 2 reviews? If you're a guy (or even a women) who secretly loves Barbara Kingsolver's early works or has a tattered copy of the YaYa Sisterhood or Little Alters stuffed in the bottom of your sock drawer, then you can proudly add this book to your collection. A great read with fun, everyday characters from all our lives who (through a comical adventure testing the human spirit) change before your eyes. From small town, across country to the haunts of New Orleans, this book will come to life as each page turns. I bought 20 copies for Christmas and got 20 sincere thanks back. Buy, read and enjoy!"
2,In the minority,"I read this book mostly because of the overwhelmingly 5-star reviews here at Amazon, but I will have to stand with those few others who were underwhelmed. There are simply so many tangents throughout the story that plot is constantly bogged down. There were very funny lines scattered throughout, but I found myself just wanting it all to be over. The character development is very shallow...so shallow that I didn't care what happened to whom. It was kind of like reading slap-slick comedy...funny to watch, not so funny to read. I do think that, in the hands of the right director, it would make a good movie and am a little surprised that it has never been tried."
2,Brevity,"Brevity is the soul of wit. Don't read this book if you have just finished the incredibly funny Norwood by Charles Portis. Handling Sin would be a lot funnier at half the length -- in that regard it reminded me of what a hard slog it was getting through the Girl With The Dragon Tattoo trilogy. So hard that, in fact, I never read book three! Somewhere in Handling Sin is a much smaller and more focused book that isn't trying to be an ""all things to all people"" classic."
2,"Somewhat funny, but too distracting","I think Malone is a talented writer. This book is a picaresque in the tradition of Don Quixote. But, this book fails where Don Quixote succeeded.First, the numerous digressions from the main plot were extremely distracting. I would be reading one of these asides for two or three pages, and then suddenly get jarred back into the main plot. Some of these digressions were funny and quirky, but they often did not seem to have a point relating to the story. It seems that they were just stuck in to up the quirkiness of the book. Quirkiness just for its own sake is hollow, and a poor substitution for genuine humor.Second, the characters were all too outlandish. Granted, in this style of book, the characters will be extreme. But, Malone didn't rein in his characters in the least. So, they end up being incomplete and unbelievable.Perhaps Malone's fans will enjoy this. I did not."
3,a farce,"This is a fun, lighthearted story, but I didn't find it hysterically funny like I expected from the hype. If you like farce-style humor you'll love this book.I found that many of the flashback scenes took away from the momentum of the book. I enjoyed the characters and I'm glad I read it, but I probably won't read more from this author. Enjoy."
2,It's a long way to get to nothing...,"I finish every book I start. I thought this book would never end. I didn't find it particularly humorous or even interesting. Slow, slow, slow...thank goodness it's over so I can go read something interesting. I agree with another reviewer. You could put all the characters in a bus and drive it off a cliff. Now that would be funny. Don't even start reading this book. BORING."
1,Big disappointment,"The reviews were good, I like all of the Michael Malone mysteries that I have read... but alas, the book was a big disappointment. It failed to get my attention at the beginning but I stuck with it, hoping to start caring about any of the characters or to laugh. Neither happened. Somewhere around page 150, I gave up; I'll stick to Malone's mysteries."
1,"Well, I'll be the first to disagree....","As one who regularly teaches a course in Southern literature, I bought this book to see if it might be a good addition to the syllabus. From the start, I got just sick of the writer's self-indulgent, smirking attempts at humor. I guess I prefer books that seem written for readers, not for the tongue-in-cheek amusement of their authors. In short, I found the style of Handling Sin insufferable--so much so that I confess to having stopped reading after page 75 or so. Save your money, and look for my copy on eBay."
1,Over Rated Britsh Humor. Ha Ha with dirty words. Ha Ha.,Banal stupity with some interesting words through out. I have read to of this guys top books and they are aweful they do have some interesting vocabulary and bizzare dash of dirty words to enliven this crap. Almost as bad as Sarah Palin's material. Uck.
5,Move over John Irving,"After being sorely disappointed with Irving's last epic self-indulgent bore, I came upon this book as an Amazon recommendation and now I cannot stop recommending this book to everyone I know. It is laugh out loud funny while at its heart a truely touching tale about family and self discovery. Malone amazingly creates a wonderful tale which takes its main character on a sojourn which exposes his family secrets while at the same time awakens him to his own doubts and strenghts. I hesitated to compare Malone to Irving as Malone's other novels are quite different, however this book defintely compares to Irving at his best (Garp,Widow for a Year)where humor carries the reader through the main characters trying times and road to self discovery and realization. The definitive difference being its southern roots and down home style. I have read two more of Malone's books since ""Handling Sin"" and have come to enjoy him immensely,"
5,don't let the title fool you,"This is a delightful romp, a big-hearted, earthy tale to grab onto with both hands and enjoy the marvelous ride."
1,Great Sugar wafers!,These sugar wafers are awesome. Perfect sweetness. The ones I buy in the grocery store are fresh and crispy. The ones I received from Amazon are towards the end of their shelf life (less than 60 days). Not as good as the fresh ones in the store.
5,memories,"I have been eating Biscoes Sugar Wafers for at least 60 years. I was heart broken when Nabisco stoped making these delicious treats. Now as I understand, they are bing made in Canada, wonderful. They arrived within a week and arrived fresh and as tasty as I remember. I will acontinue to order them through Amazon as long as they carry them. Bravo Canada."
1,Story Under Water,"Luckily for us, Dobyns comes from the ""readers need constant review"" school of writing. That's good because when you get to the point (early in the book) when you are skimming for all that you are worth, you can still keep up with the thin story line that is lost under layers of useless detail. Robert Parker would have gone through this book with a machete and come up with a real page turner. I don't know if Dobyns was paid by the word or the character or both but the result is a story that had me rooting for the murderer. Dobyns does capture the essense of life on a prep school campus reasonably well (although the headmaster has entirely too much time to waste, as do the students who apparently don't have to show up for class). You can put your time to much better use."
4,A Good Thriller,"It doesn't quite come up to ""The Church of Dead Girls,"" but Stephen Dobyns has a knack for giving us characterization, description and plot. There's plenty of all three in this novel.Jim Hawthorne, a famed psychologist who blames himself for the deaths of his wife and daughter in a fire started by an obsessed student, takes the job of headmaster at a failing New England preparatory school that has become the dumping ground for troubled kids. Hawthorne hopes to save the school and students as a redemption for his past failure.The job isn't made easy when his efforts are met with suspicion and a campaign to undermine his success. The serene, ivy-clad campus conceals a world of secrets, corruption and murderous plots. In addition to Hawthorne, there are some equally intriguing characters including a 15-year-old student who previously was a stripper, a few devious staff members, a cook with a penchant for dirty stories and an old-time Boston cop I felt should have been given more space."
2,Boring and disappointing,"I really looked forward to Dobyns' lastest novel. His previous work ""Church of the Dead Girls"" was excellent and creepy; however ""Boy in the Water"" is boring and tedious to read. He hasn't created characters that are interesting nor ones that I care about. I agree with the reader from Indiana that the book is repetitive and the action takes entirely too long to begin. Sadly, I would not recommend this novel to anyone I almost did not finish it."
2,Very Slow,"I was hoping for a good page turner. It turned out to be a book that was just a brutal read. Very slow, very detailed and very very hard to get through. At the end of the book I hated myself for finishing this."
4,"A nice, scarey read, with limitations...","This is a nice example of the genre (although I must say Stephen King is the master, and Dobyns, while good, is nowhere near King at his best.) The plot was interesting, although somewhat scattered. The characters were rather uneven, some developed well, some left hanging so that one wondered about their motivations at times. The atmosphere was ok, the whole book was ok, although I don't know if I'd buy it in hardback unless I was a huge fan of his.I haven't read The Church of Dead Girls, so I don't know if this is better or worse or what. I assume that one is better, based on other reviews here and on the back of the book. All in all I'd say, a fair read, but not a fabulous one."
5,A gifted writer,"Whereas his previous work ""Church of Dead Girls"" explored the layers of a town's folk suspicions of one another, ""Boy in the Water"" jumps in at the deep end of the dysfunctional pool and never comes up for air.It's been a week since I turned the last page but the story won't let go. Do yourself a favor and read everything this man has ever written. Don't make the mistake of lending out the books because replacements are dear."
3,"Starts Off Beautifully, But Ends Like A Scooby-Doo Episode","I love the first couple of chapters in this book-- the writing is incredible in these chapters. I could visualize everything perfectly. I particurarly like the way Dobyns begins chapters with ""close-ups"" that appear very innocent and benign, but then he slowly reveals a ""wide-angle"" view that is unexpected and sinister.About mid-way through the book, the plot becomes clumsy and not very believable. Dobyns' beautiful writing is hindered by a second-rate gothic plot. Suddenly very true to life material is invaded by imagery of ghosts and spectars. And while the theme of the book and the characters do revolve around past events that haunt them, Dobyns' introduction of overt ghost/haunting imagery is clumsy and destroys the eerie subtlety of the first half of the book."
1,Not recommended.,"""Boy in the Water"" is a complete disappointment, considering Dobyns is the author of the truly magnificent ""The Church of Dead Girls."" ""Boy ..."" is repetitive and boring, full of stock characters with ridiculous motivations and reactions. This novel was a chore to read. For a true suspense masterwork, check out Dobyns' ""Church ..."" Throw this one in the water."
4,"Smart Story, Stupid Protagonist","This effort was good, however, I enjoyed Church of the Dead Girls much better.It seemed to me that the main character was really clueless. Maybe one could argue that he was in denial about the strange events that were taking place at Bishop's Hill, but it seemed like his head was under the sand for far too long. It became somewhat frustrating to read about him."
5,The Price of Success,"What happens after fame and success, when you no longer have control of your life? Buzz Aldrin by hard work, natural abilities, and good fortune; was in July 1969 one of only two people who had walked on the moon. This is the story of Buzz Aldrin, half of the book tells of his life from childhood until Apollo 13. The rest is what becoming famous did to him and his family. Return to Earth is most remarkable in the honesty with which it tells his story. This book is not a NASA press release, this is the rise, fall, and recovery of Buzz. This is the story on a grand scale of the everyone who has had their fifteen minutes of fame, and then has to ask now what?"
4,prince,"I just loved it, i really could have used more of it, yessir!!!!!! I am a prince fan so how can you(me) go wrong with anything he does."
3,Nostalgia,"I remember seeing these movies way back in my youth, between episodes of Ultraman and Saturday morning Godzilla matinees. It was great to see the movies reproduced on DVD. While the action is campy and the storylines are strange, it is a wonderful romp into early Japanese science fiction & action hero movies."
3,Starman: Savior Of The Universe...,"Once again, Starman (Ken Utsui) must save our planet from the evil-doers! This time around, it's those nasty foreigners from Mirapolia trying to take over Japan and the rest of the globe! They've got several atomic bombs and a new detonator device! Can Starman possibly defeat these forces of wickedness?? Watch him kick, flip, swing, and fly about in his trademark body-stocking w/ underarm wings! I enjoy these goofy movies, but then again, I'm pretty goofy myself..."
2,Needs editing or a screenwriter,"I was attracted to this book because I enjoyed the movie ""Zodiac"", (which was written by screenwriter James Vanderbilt) and I thought the Robert Graysmith criminal element may prove interesting.Sadly Graysmith had few cohesive thoughts in the book. It bounces around far too much from the death of Bob Stevens, to Mohammed Atta, NBC, Homeland Security, the CDC and back to AMI among others. The aforementioned are all critical to the story. When there is a gap in time and with such a detailed story it would have been better had it been tighter.Graysmith has not turned out to be my favorite author. But, when it comes to movies based on his original writing, such as ""Zodiac"" or commentary he provides on the Autofocus DVD discussing the investigation into the murder of Bob Crane, I have become a fan."
3,Good but too long,"Not living in America, I knew relatively little about the Anthrax killer, so the story was new to me.Its strengths are the detailed review of the facts of the case, and the telling of the general history of biological warfare since WW2. It also tells us about the unfortunate victims and their terrible suffering.The trouble is, it tries to weave too many different things into a single narrative, which gets confusing. There is a lot of back tracking, and the story is interrupted constantly by anecdotes about Soviet, American, and Iraqi anthrax factories, previous anthrax leaks, the Una bomber, and various other mail-crimes, some of which are repetitive and not terribly relevant.I did like the book tho, it sent a chill up my spine more than once. Consider the fact that several countries now stock enough anthrax bombs to kill every person on earth! Terrifying when you think about it."
1,Well researched but poorly written,"Although an intersesting account of the investigation of the anthrax mailings in 2001, this book is poorly written and hard to follow. I often got the impression that the author was quoting sources that he doesn't understand which made for a confusing and dissapointing read."
5,Excellent cutlery,"This has quickly become one of my favorite tools. While it may be listed as a veggie knife, where it excels, it works great on meat and thin slices of fish and poultry. Depth of the blade, combined with its length, makes it very comfortable for food prep while working with meat or veggies very close to the hands and fingers."
5,Still Going After All These Years,"There was a time in the 70s when every cat lover worth his or her salt had at least one Kliban icon. I had the calendars, of course...and two giant-sized beach towels imprinted with one of Kliban's distinctive classic cats. The towels were later stolen from a swim-club locker room, and I still mourn them.Imagine my delight, therefore, when I found this retrospective collection of vintage Kliban felines! If you ""love to eat them mousies,"" you will love this calendar. And if you are new to Kliban, who passed away many years ago, all I can say is...buy this calendar, hang it in a prominent place--and ENJOY!"
1,Where is Steve Harvey?,"Steve Harvey is not on this DVD. Def Comedy Jam and Cedrice the Entertainer but no Steve Harvey. I'm afraid to order it again. If Steve Harvey is not one of the comedian then I think you should remove his name and his picture--right away!That's the only reason why I rated this product so low. Other than the ""missing Steve Harvey"", this dvd was funny and exceptional."
4,Aurora Kitten,"We bought 2 of these as backup for the one our daughter got when she was born. They are identical to the original, however; our daughter can tell the difference. Hopefully she will warm up to this kittens eventually. As for durability...these things last forever, the original has been dropped, run over, been through the washer and dryer more times than I can count and it is still being dragged around by a 15 month old."
3,Getting into his mind,"Commonly the outstanding figures in history are understood by their attributed deeds and not by much else. But, of course, they were as human as you and I, and therefore variously quirky. This book not only follows the famous Capt. Cook's curriculum vitae, but also paints a picture of his somewhat inscrutable and sometimes dark personality, revealed in his relations with his crews and others in his life -- a bit much of this morbidity for my tastes, but perhaps necessary to a full conception of the man."
4,A very good book,"I love this book! In third grade, I had a reading group and chose this book to read.In these brillliant pages, you'll find a wolf hybrid, Sharon Hinkler, glow ropes, and Ms. Jewel. I'd recommend this book to anybody, even if they're not interested in wolf hybrids because I don't think too much of them myself, but I love this book anyway.From the paperback cover-Written by Cora C."
3,Less is NOT More,"By the very nature of a greatest hits package, some disagreement on inclusion is bound to happen. When you have an artist with the body of work that Steely Dan has put out, the quandry of what to include is even more pronounced. My vote would be to forego this album, and buy the boxed set. 20 years ago, I bought the 2-album greatest hits package to cut my teeth on Steely Dan, and even as generous as that was, it still didn't scratch the surface of what I now consider to be my favorites. The only thing this has going for it is the original guitar ending to FM, which I personally prefer to the sax ending, which is on the Gold Expanded and the boxed set."
5,An excellent compilation,"An excellent selection of 14 of SD's songs from ""Can't Buy a Thrill"", ""Pretzel Logic"", ""Katy Lied"", ""Countdown to Ecstacy"", ""Royal Scam"", ""Aja"" and ""Gaucho"". While a lot of good material was obviously omitted, let's face it, you can only fit 74 minutes of music on a CD. Another plus is that ""FM"" is on this CD but isn't on any of their original CD's, most of which I already have. But all things considered, about the best justice that can be done to Becker and Fagen's clever lyrics and jazzy rock style on a 74 minute CD.Verdict: Best choice if you are buying your first Dan CD. But if you are a real Dan fan, buy all the original albums instead--but you'll have to buy this one anyway if you really want the song ""FM""."
4,Blast from the past,"CD came as advertised. Fast and in the original cover. This album is just one of a number of Steely Dan CD's that can be classified as ""Greatest Hits"". Since receiving it I must have played it a dozen times without any problems. Great band, great memories."
4,How come?,"Several excellent tracks but how could the following be omitted:""Rose Darling""; ""The Royal Scam"" (especially ""The Royal Scam""); and ""Katy Lied"". Still, it is overall a good collection."
2,Buy Show Biz Kids instead,"I am a huge Steely Dan fan and I don't really like the song selection on this one disc compilation. The music on this disc doesn't even fill up the 80 minutes on a CD. I think that a more reasonable one disc SD compilation would look like this:1. Do it Again2. Dirty Work3. Reelin' in the Years4. Bodhisattva5. Show Biz Kids6. My Old School7. Rikki Don't Lose that Number8. Pretzel Logic9. Black Friday10. Bad Sneakers11. Kid Charlemagne12. Don't Take Me Alive13. The Fez14. Black Cow15. Peg16. Josie17. FM18. Hey NineteenYes, all that can fit on one disc! Putting ""East St. Louis Toodle-Oo"" on here is ridiculous, and not including Josie, Dirty Work, and The Fez is simply unnacceptable."
3,Live???,"I noticed the word ""[Live]"" at the end of the CD title, but I cannot find the word ""live"" anywhere on the CD itself. And I cannot find any mention of a live version of ""A Decade of Steely Dan"". I believe Steely Dan's only live albums are ""Alive in America"" and ""Plush TV Jazz-Rock Party""."
2,A Whole Decade For This,"You know you're in trouble when a greatest hits album is dull. But then Steely Dan's obsession with studio perfection and fascination with Jazz clichés is not exactly the stuff of greatness. In fact, I would argue that given Dan's obsessions, it would be impossible for them to be any good, but they did have a few good tracks. If you are interested, this might be the place for you to start, but I recommend CAN'T BUY A THRILL, it's not a great album either, but it's probably the best album this band ever put out."
3,Most of the Big Hits,"Though they were never a singles (or touring) band, Steely Dan created some of the most memorable rock recordings in the 70s. The bad news is that this collection sells itself short, offering only a small slice of Steely Dan's magnitude. Fans will not find ""Show Biz Kids,"" ""The Fez,"" ""Pretzel Logic,"" ""Josie,"" or ""Time Out of Mind,"" all of which hit the charts. It's unknown why such trifles as ""Babylon Sisters,"" ""East St. Louis Toodle-OO"" and ""Bad Sneakers"" made the grade when more worthy songs could have been placed in their stead. Still, casual fans will not be disappointed."
4,Steely Dan MP3 album,"I think the process of the download and transfer to the MP3 player as overly involved, but once down the quality of the music is good."
3,"Good collection, just not my preference","I bought this collection because at the time I was going to be planning in a band (didn't work out) that did some Steely Dan material. I remember listening to them years ago but had pretty much forgotten most of their tunes. I liked a few of them, and the musicianship is great, but it is just not my cup of tea. I don't find a lot of their music (with some notable exceptions of course) very pleasant to the ears. But that is just me. If you like Steely Dan a lot, you will probably love this CD."
4,Call me Deacon Blues,This is a good intro album. Kick back with a glass of scotch and listen to this one. Very mellow. The music is fantastic.
3,the originals had better sound,"I am a steely dan fan and listen to them during the early 70'sfaithfully. I do appreciate all the trying in this CD but altho I do have a very nice CD player do not receive a good sound quality from this CD version. It remarks on the back of CD that is is remaster by...and, that digitally re-mastered by.... but the original sound better. This is a group that must have good sound effect for them to shine and the listener appreciate. Not one bad song but you best stick to the originals or they may have re-done this one with better quality. I hope so for there is only one STEELY DAN. But i cannot recommend this one because of the sound quality."
1,Delano stinks,"I started reading Hellblazer from the beginning recently. And I have to tell you...the first 40 issues suck root. I kept plodding through thinking it had to get better. And it did. As soon as Garth Ennis took over writing duties. The first 40 issues were quite literally painful. I can't even begin to tell you all the things I hated about this book until Delano went away. After that, it actually starts to get interesting. Save your money and invest in some of the later books."
2,There are better choices,"I was surprised to see that there was no mute switch on this model. This can be very handy if your phone doesn't have one, letting you run water, answer a question, etc, without leaving the conversation entirely.I was disappointed to see that the batteries for the amplifier seem to be special (zinc air) that will go dead in two months regardless of usage. This makes the amplifier much less useful. The ear gel piece makes my phone seem louder so that I need the amplifier less. And the headset will work on the low setting even without any batteries. Overall volume and sound quality are good.But I'm going to try the plantronics m135 instead. It has a mute switch."
2,Fair but not good,"I had a number of problems with this product. It didn't fit in my ear very well, wasn't particularly comfortable, people complained that I sounded like I was on a speaker phone, the inline volume control should have had a mute button, the inline volume control was kind of heavy (because of the batteries), and the thing looked ugly.It broke not long ago and wasn't worth getting replaced. It got binned instead and I don't miss it, but now I am looking for a good replacement."
2,Disappointing...,"Ok, first I'd like to say that I enjoyed this system for the short time I was able to use it, which in my opinion, was too short. This unit stopped working properly on me in less than a year, with little use in a dust free and open environment. I only bought it to enhance my gaming experience, and when it worked, that it did.But as I stated earlier, it started malfunctioning after about 6 or 8 months with little use. I only play 3 or 4 hours every day or every other day, which should not bring about overheating issues. It sounds as if it might have some short inside, but who knows, I'm not tech savvy and shouldn't have to be in order to get longer usage from said unit."
1,FAMILY JEWELS,"This tale could have been improved if someone had taken the time to edit. Nevertheless, in it's present state, the reader will grow tire quickly.I take it this is the author's first book from the overwhelming spelling errors, the run-on sentences, the sentence fragments, and poor sentence structure. And although she tries to tell an interesting story, the tale was too convoluting."
5,DVDs,"Packaging was good, DVDs all play and this is what we were looking forward to watching all together. Great deal."
5,FANTASTIC SERIES,"Very good series, I have read the books, but the dvds really enhance the reading experience. These movies are good viewing.I highly recommend them."
5,The Left Behind Series,"An excellent value, getting all three movies packaged together for one low price. These movies bring the Book of Revelations to life."
1,It's Amazing!,what happens when your not allowed to use your brain from birth; and what people will to do for money. If you could only gets Mel's backing!
4,Left Behind,I bought this as a gift. I can ask the person to whom I gave it to comment. I will log in again after I do this.
1,not even close to biblical.,"Kirk Cameron is being ignorantly used as a tool of evil. there, i said it.and YES, i am a christian.fear is not a tool that should ever be used to love folks into the kingdom."
4,Awsome Message for Non-christians,"In this movie, all the really preachy christians are magically swept away leaving the world free to live without fairy tales. There is even a semi-hot blonde stewardess to oggle.Rapture:1 : an expression or manifestation of ecstasy or passionOh, how wonderful the world would be without all those pesky-preachies. This movies confirms the dream of many that some day we could set archaic religion aside and just live our lives.Kirk Cameron has time to sit in a bar and drink beer. A father has time to spend time with his daughter after his church-obsessed wife evaporates. With the exception of some car bombs and black-clad baddies this movie makes me wish that the rapture really existed.The only reason I had to take away a star is the 55/90 minutes spent holding bibles and proclaiming ""ALL THE ANSWERS ARE IN HERE!"" I think most of the main characters missed the point and the real opportunity of this fantasy story."
2,badly produced christian right scfi prodution,only watched one of three... disappointed at it.. why didn't it show where the raptured went... did not take into accounts of end of days that other philosphys have... highly disappointed... anyone who is a student of spiritual philosophy should avoid this narrow minded and tunnel vision of the religious righteous
1,Campier than Priscilla Queen of the Desert.,"This movie must have been made by the Pastor Ted's of the Christian world. This movie is so campy and so bad in a good way, that I almost forgot how creepy the people who believe in this stuff are.As a gay man who wanted a good laugh, this movie did not disappoint. I only gave it one star because, well, it just didn't have a very believable message."
1,not as good as the book series,"I was honestly let down when i watched this. the first dvd is the message on accepting christ, and the second dvd is a serious chop job of the left behind book series."
4,Excellent Representation,The 3 movies are an excellent representation of possible senario's of the future as told in the book of Revelations.
2,Poor films,"LEFT Behind was an excellent well written book, the movie series was not.The first film, opens with one might say the cheesiest special effects since the 1960s war films.Directed by Vic Sarin, a Canadian Moslem, the acting seems right out of LIFETIME original movie, with exception of Kirk Cameron.But most disturbing at all, Left Behind essentially a Christian ficition film with no mention of the name of Jesus? Or much mention of Christanity. Only the vague God and some type of Heaven is mentioned, but never really explained.I challenge anyone to spot the name of Jesus in this film. It just isn't there.Despite this, the LEFT BEHIND was decent, with a lot of effort from Kirk Cameron, and the intense scenarios of the books to rely on.The second two sequels films are more B movie terroritory, (They actually mention Jesus so this is an improvement) so if you like that then buy them. I would suggest rent this movie at your local Family Video store. It is not worth the sell."
2,Read the books,"I enjoyed watching the movies but the movies do not compare favorably with the books. I have read the entire Left Behind series; there are major discrepancies between the books and the movies. I realize that it is difficult to cram 12 novels into 3 short movies but major aspects and relationships should not be changed. While the basic tenets of the books are maintained, albeit loosely, many important details are not. For example, the relationship between Hattie and Rayford is markedly different in the movie. There are many other examples but a full critique is not appropriate here. Read the books."
3,Don't be Left Behind!!!,"Very realistic and to the point. Having read the book series I would watch the movies first then read the books - both are a great eye opener. Hard hitting, moving and very sad for the reality the producers are trying to put across. Of course, the books have more depth, but these films portray a strong cross section of what is going on, and what Revelation is all about in modern day cinema mode. Good action/drama, not a Steven Speilberg version, but very well portrayed with special effects and intense action."
3,Good Movie,"I enjoyed these movies. I first bought ""left behind"" on vhs at the Walmart bargain bin. I enjoyed it and wanted to see the other parts."
2,Left Behind,How can I return it? I thought this would be something my parents would like... not so much.Joe Bellinger
5,A Great Movie For All Christians...and their friends,"This movie set is great, specially the first movie. It basically walks you through the end of days scenario based on the Bible. A lot of the prophecies develop while you watch and the suspense of it is intense. This movie is great for showing your non-Christian friends that are curious about the Book of Revelations or the ones who more or less ask -whats the worst that could happen by not being right with God? This movie set will answer that question and also provide great entertainment to the already Christian family. A must have for any believer."
4,Left Behind: The Collection,"I love the movies, but the first two did't have the option of Closed Captions. Other than that, it was great entertainment and thought provoking. Makes me want to study the book of Revelation (from the Biible) again."
3,Satisfied,"Satisfied with purchase, although I enjoyed the book series better. But it is all good and to the benefit of the Kingdom of God."
2,Does not follow the book of revalations,"It was hard to follow even for 2 devout christians it skipped over the seals and the antichrist trying to kill everyone without the mark it skipped over the whore of babylon etc, not worth it"
3,First two videos were good; third was disappointing. Read the books!,"I read all 15(?) books in the Left Behind Series, and was curious to see how they could boil the story down to only 3 videos. The first two videos were mostly true to the books, but the third totally broke away from the books and not in a good way, and did not bring the story to its conclusion. The video series is worth watching, but don't let it be a substitute for reading the books. The story is based on the Book of Revelation, but it is a great adventure story in its own right. You don't have to be an Evangelical Christian to enjoy them."
1,This is just bad,"Bad acting, bad writing, bad directing and even worse theology combine to make the LEFT BEHIND series a genuinely atrocious experience. The films appear to have the budget of a made for cable quickie. I will never understand the appeal of this sort of nonsense. Perhaps if people took more time actually READING the bible and studying history instead of looking to this garbage for spiritual insight, we would be spared any more installments of this laughably bad extravaganza of lunacy."
3,Left Behind_The DVD Collection,"I felt that the seller was a little deceptive about the number of DVD's in the set. It was a little unclear, to me anyway, how many were in the set. I also did not like the fact that I cannot go back and change the method of delivery even though I had not left the screen. Anyway other than that I was satisfied with the service, prompt delivery and quality of the item."
1,Not a complete set.,"When I recieved the DVD boxed set, it was supposed to have 3 different movies in a series. It contained the first movie, and two of the second movie, and no third movie...I am very disappointed."
4,Good series,"I liked it. I have not read the books.Interesting, and good acting, with good christian background. it would be nice if it was more complete, i understand there are 16 books, and only 3 movies. it ended well, just didn't go all the way to the end end of the world. so i felt a little incomplete. otherwise, it was good. I would think non-believers could enjoy it as well and could leave it at that, or be used as a hook to get people interested in Christianity."
4,For a good time of reflection,"Even though Revelations is a well known name in Biblical issues, its content it's not so well known. We have a few myths built over a pair of verses, but the real issue is still a mistery. But if you want to take a chance to discuss how the end of the world can affect you, see this movie series, and then discuss it seriously with someone you think can confirm or debate the facts in the movie."
1,The Rupture,"This movie should have been named the Rupture....it is nothing more than a ruptured gall bladder spilling bile into the world. The production was 5th rate, the acting the 10th rate, the story was 8th rate. I am not atheist, but this movie was complete drivel...."
4,Left Behind Collection,"This is a great collection. I have almost finished the book series and these movies made it possible for me to put a face with the characters. Although the movies vary, sometimes greatly, from the books, I recommend them very highly. This is a great vehicle to spread the message of Christ."
2,"If you've read the books, disappointing","After reading the series, I was interested to see the video. I was very disappointed. Had I not read the story, the movie wouldn't have made a lot of sense and didn't have the impact that the books had. Too many events in the movie that didn't connect without having read the book."
5,Definitive Guide to Quaker Beliefs,"This is a very definitive encapsulation of Quaker (Friends) beliefs written in a forthright, easy to understand format. Jack Willcuts wrote this several years ago, but it stands the test of time and is a fantastic reference book to refresh Quakers on the core beliefs. I bought it for that purpose and found that it can also be an excellent reference for any church on how to work within the community in carrying out Jesus' ministry."
1,"Mediocre, no reason to buy this","Ordinary book, no revelations, no new or useful info. I'd rather read techniques from pros, not novices billing themselves as ""being in touch with regular golfers""...."
1,NEVER ORDERED / SAME THEIF COMPANY,"This product, I have no idea if it's good or not or what or who it is. What I do know is a greedy merchant added to my credit card and that's theft."
5,Kirk At His Best,"This DVD is a must see for people who love quality gospel concerts. Kirk has a true talent for writing soul stirring music and these songs really put you in touch with Jesus. Sometimes you are on your feet praising God and other times you can hardly say a word because the awesome power of God's salvation is too deep to fathom. Kirk invested in top quality musicians, especially the horn section which was off the chain. I can't stop watching this video."
3,Oh well,"As much as I adore Acoustic Alchemy, this is the CD that I listen to least. When I played it for my parents they mistook it for a Kenny G record. Every great group takes a wrong turn somewhere along the line. This was theirs."
4,"Wow, does this book hit the mark!","This is the second Ed Strnad book I've read (the first was the ""Optimists/Pessimists Guide to the Millenium"") and once again, this author has hit the mark. I would guess Ed is a baby-boomer peering over the age abyss and not liking what he's seeing. But he has such a funny way of encapsulating that stomach-churning feeling all of us boomers are feeling that I swear he's tapping our phones. I don't usually laugh out loud when I read a book, but this one had me guffawing on the bus -- and disturbing my fellow passengers. How could they know I was laughing at getting old!"
2,Good idea but not a permanent solution,"Does not fit snugly (then again neither does the stylus that comes with the phone). Over time the caps became loose and the stylus remains in the phone. Also, the tip breaks easily. Better than plain ones though."
2,Does not fit snugly,I bought these and after about 2 months of owning them I am down to the last one.The stylus don't fit so it flies out of the slot compared to the original stylus that came with it. I am going to try the OEM ones from UTC Starcomm to see if they work better and post a review.
2,you get what you pay for,"I was excited about the price, they fit perfectly and worked fine...for a while. Then the top started to come loose all the time, leaving the stylus firmly in the phone. Finally got it out, replaced with #2. Same thing, on to #3, same thing. Each one lasted maybe 2 weeks? Now I am on the hunt for new ones. I don't remember the original stylus coming with a removable top (to access the reset button) but I never had trouble accessing it before. The removable cap is a liability not an asset in my opinion."
1,item never received,"I never received the product. First they lost my package, then they only gave me a partial refund. satisfaction was not guaranteed and I would not do business with this company again . . . THEY LIE!!!"
5,"Beautiful pattern, great instructions","This variation to the classic log cabin design is beautiful. As always Eleanor's instructions are clear, detailed and percise. She offers yardage and instructions for wallhanging, twin, full, queen/king and this is not always the case with other books. Also included are examples are the many ways to configure the blocks once they are sewn. The instructions are written step by step with diagrams the whole way through, plus tips. The book also includes iron on patterns for making the triangle pieces as well as instructions for penciling your own triangles.I am a beginner quilter and made the regular log cabin pattern a few years ago. Star log cabin is definitely a step up in difficulty but completely do-able with the instructions in this book. I just completed the wall hanging and couldn't be happier with the outcome!"
5,Tao Te Ching - Translated by John H. McDonald,"One of the classic texts of Chinese philosophy, the Tao Te Ching has had an enormous influence on art and literature throughout the world. Famous for its simple, earthy philosophy, it includes astute advice for leaders and practical wisdom for common people, emphasizing the passive, solid, and quiescent qualities of nature and ""having without possessing."" If you're looking for peace in an increasingly hectic world, perhaps the Tao Te Ching can help you find the way. This edition features a beautifully clear and modern interpretation by John H. McDonald that is complemented by the book's elegant typesetting and design. This illustrated edition features exquisite Chinese images that bring out the timeless wisdom of the text and its subtle guidance on how to live well."
2,Doesn't fit into a lot of locker holes,"When it works, it works, but it actually doesn't fit into a lot of holes that would allow for a lock. The flaw of this design is that the silver metal bit swings inward, and not outward."
2,not good for lockers,it doesn't open very wide. there is barely enough space (less then half an inch) to get it off a locker. you couldn't get it through the links of a an average sized chain. the numbers are really small.
1,Easy to break,"I bought this lock to use at my gym. I wanted something with a simple combination. First of all, the opening was barely large enough for a standard gym locker, I had to angle the lock just so to get it through the locker's handle - this took much longer than a standard lock would have, eliminating my goal of saving time. Worse, when I returned from exercising, the lock had been tampered with, apparently by hand, and although it was still on the lock (I suspect because the would be thief couldn't figure out just how to maneuver the lock to get it off the handle) the lock had been bent and would no longer close completely, rendering it useless. Money down the drain. I do not recommend because it is too small for most uses and is not tamper-proof."
1,Not worth it,"The lock barely opens, not enough to fit around any normal locker. Also it is surprisingly heavy. I would just stick with the traditional master lock"
1,Doesn't fit most lockers,"I was super excited about this lock but as a previous reviewer mentioned, it has a fatal design flaw. It doesn't open very wide so I can't get it around most lockers. It barely fits on the lockers at my gym but I have to maneuver it and fight with it to get it on and off the lockers. Pick something else, maybe they'll redesign this one someday!"
5,Lock,It took forever to get and when Amazon put on there charges. It would have been a lot cheaper to buy at Ace hardware
1,Master Lock for Backpack Zippers,"I purchased one of these 4 years ago and it has worked well. Does what I want. I recently bought another one and the combination wheels are so stiff I can not set a combination away from the default combination delivered with the lock. I'm sure I can return it but it isn't worth the shipping charges and associated time it takes to get a replacement. From my perspective, there is a 50-50 chance of getting a defective lock. Not something I will buy again especially online."
2,Master lock,"Clever, but I haven't really found functionality for it yet...hopefully I will, I initially got it for my motorcycle helmet but ended using a Masterlock small cable style lock instead that doesn't leave my helmet in a position to scratch my bike..."
2,Be very careful with infants/toddlers under 3 - balls break off,"Though this toy is developed with infants and toddlers in mind, and the idea is sound, the balls come off the end of the sticks and pose a choking and poking hazard to young ones. Great idea, needs safety improvements."
3,Individualism and Romance in Viet Nam,"In the editor's introduction to ""A Time Far Past,"" we are encouraged to read this novel as a North Vietnamese perspective on the American Wars. Don't come here for such a story. Le Luu weaves a simple, heroic love story around life of a villager who refusal to submit to the fate of his childhood, arranged marriage. Going off to war to escape his wife, he still lacks the ability to define his sense of self. We watch his late-blooming after many failed relationships through the eyes of a somewhat moralizing and acutely critical narrator whose portrayal of shifting cultural values in Viet Nam is intimate and human. While this experimental, multiperspective narrative is sometimes unconvincing, I found I could not put it down. Among the few novels mentioned in the plot is Jane Eyre. My opinion is that if you like a good romance you will enjoy this."
4,Awesome,"This was anotger great find through Amazon. They never let me down. I will remain a loyal customer and recommend Amazon to everyone that is looking for hard to find music. Thanx again Amazon for the great music selection.Sincerly ""Bert"""
4,"Two Great Madonna Songs,,Classics",If you like these two songs get this EP. I especially think the remastered sound is great for 20 yr old songs...
3,A Bargain,"Why do I say this is a bargain? For two reasons. One is that these same shorts are available on a double DVD offered by Soitenly Stooges and Knuckleheads, official merchandise from those who own the rights to the Stooges - and they charge 30 bucks for theirs, even though all four shorts available can't be more than an hour and fifteen minutes, so there is no need for a double DVD. There is also a DVD with only two of these shorts that is a dollar more! The second reason is, these shorts are in the public domain, and two (Malice in the Palace and Brideless Groom) have never been available from Columbia TriStar Home Video. Since so many who call themselves fans restrict their tastes to Curly, these shorts aren't likely to be released officially any time soon. But I love Shemp and these shorts are pretty good. If you don't like Shemp, don't buy this - because I guarantee that the production notes and biographies of the stars included in this package are bogus and inaccurate!"
4,Well worth it,"You can't go wrong on this for eight bucks. One Curly short, but the three Shemp shorts are good ones."
2,Good but only for harcore fans,"The Get Up Kids second E.P. ""Red Letter Day"" is good but there is no sense in buying it unless you are a hardcore fan. Red Letter Day was alos released on a double E.P. (""Red Letter Day/Woodson"" which has both of the Get Up Kids E.Ps on it for practically the same price as purchasing one of them)and the actual song Red Letter Day is on their second album ""Something to Write Home About"". I don't understand what is so great about this song that we have to be forced into listening to it on 3 of the five Get Up Kids CDs. If you want some better Get Up Kids songs listen to ""Valentine"", ""I'm a Loner Dottie, A Rebel"" and their first single ""Action and Action"". Music from the their first album is great too but nothing compares to their second L.P."
1,"Just another Get Up Kids release, kids...","Basically what this CD comes down to is Anne Arbour, as the other songs are on the full-length CD that follows.Anne Arbour's winding melodies and heartfelt vocals lend creedence to the view that the Get Up Kids could be very good, assuming that the vast majority of their lyrics and songs improved to the point at which they weren't ripping off Braid consistently anymore.And even then, the original version of Anne Arbour (7"" released by Subpop) is a million, bizillion times better than this one.Just thought I'd warn you guys ahead of time..."
5,AMAZING,"this little 5 song teaser EP features their new keyboardist. he adds to the intensity of the music, while the passion in the lyrics is still flaring. well worth buying and forcing everyone you know to listen to it."
5,Ever wonder what cats sound like?,"This is an ABSOLUTELY delightful book to listen to! Mr. Longden's ability to give voices and personalities to animals, and especially inanimate objects is a remarkable gift. His accent is charming and the voices he gives his cats and their pets - a wire brush, a walnut [an especially ugly one] and a sultana, will have you giggling down the highway. While listening to this I went straight to see if he had any other books on tape, but sadly, he does not. I do hope he's working on another one. This would be a wonderful gift for a cat lover or anyone who enjoys a clever turn of phrase. His writing is excellent! This was one of the best books I have ever listened to - and I listen to lots! Absolutely worth the price!"
3,It's adequate for practicing not for live performances.,"It lacks the low end freq. that is needed for live performances, I prefer miking the instrument live more dynamics, you could still get this mike plus miking and control it using two channels on the mixer, you do that anyway even with a built-in mic system on a guitar controlling it on the guitar controls.Other than that the installation was easy, sometimes while using it, I might inadvertently pop the connector in the ""0"" hole. But it's okay, I think the 2 system that you mount inside would probably be better sounding but that's a whole lotta work to install, I have it mounted on my old guitar that I don't want to drill any holes in it, and it's good for that purpose, and it can be easily removed. But for me it's good enoug for fooling around not for pro gigs"
2,Disappointing.,"This book is 482 pages long, and the second half of it is not Lightwave-(or even 3D)-specific: general concepts of animation like follow-through, squash-and-stretch, etc. Everything in this section has been said before, and more eloquently, in many other books on the topic of animation.The first half (which IS Lightwave-specific) is a step-by-step tutorial for building a rather esoteric IK rig for a humanoid character. I didn't find it helpful--nothing in the exercises seems designed to expand the reader's understanding, it's just a recipe for reconstructing Albee's rig. I suspect any reader without a previous understanding of how bones work in Lightwave will be completely frustrated.If you're a beginner looking for a technical resource to animating in Lightwave, this is definitely *not* it. Any potential buyers should browse through a copy before buying this."
4,Good quality screwdriver but larger diameter magnet at head...,Very good quality tool. My one gripe however showed itself the first time I used it. I had to get into a tight space and the larger diameter tip interfered with this operation . Positive lock on cap securely held the extra screwdriver bits.
5,Incredible!,"This is a very special book about two extraordinary people who ventured beyond the realm of typical sailing. Their voyage from the Arctic to Antarctica is most unusual and filled with circumstances that are almost beyond anyone's imagination. Rolf and Deborah were prepared for almost any anticipated situation, and their knowledge, experience and self-control served them very well throughout their trip. All of the photographs are mesmerizing, each with a firsthand look at scenery that few people could even comprehend. I was sorry to arrive at the end of this very exceptional book, since I would no longer be able to feel like I was aboard with them."
5,"Uplifting vocals,l beautifully put together","Can't say enough positive about this family vocal group, they truly love what they do and it shows.I would recommend any of their CDs to anyone out there looking for comfort and encouragement or just because you enjoy talent.I have had seen them in person and they are amazing!"
1,"Bad, bad science","When anyone can publish a book, they can publish anything. This book proves that.Sharks don't get heartburn, athlete's foot or jock itch. So what?This book is about bad science at its worst.Also, sharks DO get cancer."
1,Dangerous quack medicine: Sharks DO get cancer!,"This book's authors try to promote the use of shark cartilage to cure cancer, but they use bad science. In fact, as any zoologist or marine biologist will tell you, sharks do get cancer! So much for accurate research. This book's information is dangerous for two reasons: 1) people may use this unproven treatment when they need traditional medicine, and 2) many sharks are being unnecessarily killed for their cartilage. A dangerous book and a waste of money."
1,Dr. Lane still doesn't get it,"Not only do sharks get dozens of cancers, but they get several types of chondroma, which is cancer of the cartilage, according to the John Hopkins study and other reports.In 2007, a study found that shark cartilage actually *reduced* life expectancy of cancer patients (led by Dr. Charles Lu), or more likely had no measurable effect. Other studies showed a similar outcome.In 2004 the FDA shut the author's company down for making unsubstantiated claims. The FTC also barred him from making similar claims in 1998.It should be noted that cartilage, taken orally, is broken down by stomach acids into amino acids, making it indistinguishable from any other protein. Any *complete* protein that gets into the blood system would trigger an immune response. So it doesn't even make sense."
3,"BOC is great, but the DVD isn't...","Cult fan here, tattoo to prove it, but I must say I was really unhappy with this DVD. The boys put on a great show and I really enjoyed that, but the sound quality was lacking--this made the DVD painful to watch! Then I went to the interviews with the band and it's as if the guy just makes up questions on the spot. With a band that's been around for as long as BOC has, they certainly could have done some research and asked some questions that analyzed the longevity and music from BOC's perspective. The fans they chose to interview were also lame, unless you like listening to a drunken guy tell you how much he loves BOC while he is spitting and slurring his words (some of the interviews were OK, but only because they happened upon a sober fan). Just because BOC is not as popular (monetarily) as they were in the 70s and early 80s is not a reason to put out something this low of quality."
5,"Great Live Performance, but......","I have seen BOC four times over the last thirty years. Mostly in the 70's. This is a great representation of their work, and their live shows. My only complaints are:Does Eric Bloom really play guitar during this show?? Watch closely.The other is that Buck's vocals are not turned up enough. He suffers from what I hate most with live recordings, the lack of distinction of lead vocal. Overall, I am happy with the memories that this video envoked. Buck deserves to be listed with the top 10 guitarists of all time."
4,Great DVD-but not 5 stars,"Buck Dharma-probably the best under-rated guitarist of all time,I've seen BOC several times over the last 10 years,and this dvd brings back great memories of those shows.Buck's playing is flawless as usual,never missing a note.It's to bad he doesn't play his gibson SG and Les Paul more often on this dvd.His steinberger just doesn't sound as good and the tone is different than original recording we are all used to.There are some unusual songs played on this dvd which is interesting, but songs like ""take me away"",""shooting shark"", ""dancing in the ruins"" would have probably suited fans better.C'mon guys no ""astronomy"".Oh! well,buy it any way,there is not much live video of BOC available.Definitely worth $12.99.Buy it!"
1,Really Disappointed,"I'm not a huge BOC fan, but I did enjoy their music and was looking forward to seeing this concert. I played it immediately after receiving it and was very much disappointed; sounds a lot like me and a few buddies belting out the lyrics after a few drinks and the music wasn't much better. I have approximately 70 concert DVDs and have my top, middle and bottom tier shows and BOC will be at the bottom."
3,Huge Pros and Huge Cons,"Buck is great, but to be honest, one must love BOC to like this DVD as a whole. I love Buck's endless playing, but I hate the sound of the singers voice. ? I don't know how he used to sound. But, I will say that the drummer is a good showman though he looks like the rat poison guy from Dumb and Dumber; but the bassist is SO [...]! His `monster` solo on Godzilla absolutely blows (well, some cool stuff) but it takes a real idiot to come in slappin' COMPLETELY off beat. Not to mention the five minutes he spent hitting the low E and waving stage left. WHAT WAS THAT?! Also, his jumping around on stage is like an adolescent attention getting device, cause he knows we only want to see Buck. whadda [...]. But, I'll give it to the crypt keeper guy with the old tele, he's got some chops to comp, but not on the keyboard. Find a metronome, dude.Hey, I'm happy, though. `twas a christmas present."
5,Almost as good as LIVE,"I just viewed this DVD - AND I just saw BOC live at the Catalyst in Santa Cruz, CA, this week. This DVD is phenomenal. Great video, great audio, excellent editing, great song selection. To be honest, the concert sound at the Catalyst was too loud and a bit distorted, and the song selection on this DVD is better than what they are currently playing on tour. Sure, I can complain that the left out ""Astronomy"", ""Take Me Away"", and ""This ain't the summer of love"" and a few other favorites off of this DVD; but overall it is superb. Perhaps they can put out another concert DVD in a couple of years and cover the great songs missing from this one! I'd buy it! If BOC happens to read this, also include ""Golden Age of Leather"". Buck Dharma and BOC are a truly great band!"
5,Music with Musicians WHAT A CONCEPT,"WOW This is a GREAT CONCERT for both Cultophiles and the uninitiated alike!!If you like it LOUD and with five very talented musicians you are gonna love this one. I've been waiting a long time for these boys to do a live video recording and it was certainly worth the wait. The sound is very good and it is well edited.There are no ""bad tracks"" the whole darn thing is pure Rock & Roll........... AMERICAN STYLEThe Only thing better is to go see 'Em LIVEAll I can add is....... BUY IT!"
4,Blue Oyster Cult- A Long Day's Night DVD,"Some of the reviews I have read on this product do not give it justice. I've seen BOC many times during the 70's. This is a really good DVD, it has the best songs that BOC has done over the years and done very well. The concert footage is not the greatest, I remember a lot better light show back in the day. Overall I recommend this DVD to the hardcore fan as well as somebody who has never experience BOC."
1,Lifeless,"I saw Blue Oyster Cult live four times in their heyday between 1976 and 1980.I had hoped that this DVD would bring back fond memories of those days, but I was sorely disappointed.The playing, while technically fine, seemed lifeless and lacking in the fire that made those concerts so exciting.Also, they also had fantastic light shows, while the lights on this show seemed rather ordinary.Age is no excuse, because many rockers of the same vintage still put on a great show (for evidence, check out Heart Live in Seattle or Genesis When in Rome.)Finally, the sound is not that good either (again, compare with the Heart DVD that was recorded in the same year.)Frankly, I am not sure if I will even watch this one a second time, while many of my concert DVDs reward repeated viewings."
2,GOOD VIDEO - POOR AUDIO,"I've been a fan of BOC since the 70's, and was excited when I found out they had released a DVD. I was not so excited after watching it. The concert footage and the video quality were great, but the sound is terrible. I own many concert DVD's, and this by far is the worst. The vocals on some songs are so low; it becomes painful to watch after a while. About half way through the film, my wife looked over at me and said, ""We can always sell it at a tag sale""."
4,A good choice for early Covenant fans,For the most part this album has a sound similar to Covenant (pre Northern Lights). A couple of the tracks (One Level Down and Hush) remind me of Pink Floyd's Comfortably Numb. An enjoyable album with two high energy remixes.
5,A good cream for night use!,I got the day and night cream and noticed a positive difference in my skin within a week or so. I would recommend!
3,Thick Night cream,"It is a decent night cream for its price. I have been using it for about a month now. It will have to take more time for me to really know. So far I like it and I like how my skin feels in the morning, very soft."
4,Maltin's Book is Enthusiastic and Informative,"This book contains sections on every film produced during Walt's life (animated and otherwise). It also sports 2 prefaces, an intro, and sections on the shorts and short subjects, Disney TV, a filmography, and films post-Walt. As an overview, it's a fine work; obviously, you can only put so much info into a book that covers dozens of films. Each film gets between 1 and 10 pages (according to their importance). I always enjoy Maltin's writing, since he has an enthusiasm for his subjects that is passed on to the reader. What I liked best about this book is being able to read up on little-remembered pieces such as The Reluctant Dragon and Victory Through Air Power. The only drawback is that the illustrations & photos (and there are quite a few) are all in black and white; however, I suppose this did keep this book very affordable. It's also a great companion to the amazing Encyclopedia of Disney Animated Characters."
5,Thi is a proof that modern music need not be unbearable,"Martinu counts as one of the most important composers of the first half of the century. He was a bit of a globetrotter but every now and then he would go back to his roots, to his childhood in West Moravian Highlands. This ballet is no exception. It was in fact written for children - it is a string of popular East-European fairy tales. It overflows with motives from traditional Bohemian and Moravian folk music which makes it all very poetic and pleasant to listen to. Modern clasical music is usually considered very difficult to listen to but with this particular piece of Martinu, you may be inclined to change your view - this piece is perhaps a little bit like Orff's Carmina Burana but not as dark and demonic as Orff."
5,Great Book!,"I am a PGA pro and use the items in this book to test, motivate, and help my students. Charlie did a great job writing this easy to follow book that anyone can use to improve, monitor and evaluate their game!"
2,Big Disappointment,"Having greatly benefited from Rob Akins articles in Golf Digest (Future Golf Swing & Turning Chest), I was looking forward to this book's release. I am very disappointed.The book has very little detail instruction for the better player. It seems to be geared for the high handicapper. The book seems more concerned with tracking improvement than actually helping to improve."
1,Golf's Red Zone Challenge,This book offered nothing new. Lots of big pictures but nothing substantive. It was a waste of money. You can get more help from a monthly golf magazine.
1,dissapointed,I ordered this dvd because it was suppose to have heckle and jeckle cartoons. My granddaughter and I have watched and no sign of the pesky crows.
1,Not What Seems,"TV Cartoon Classics is Hardly as good as touted.Cartoon characters on the cover rarely,if ever, appear in an actual cartoon episode on the DVDs."
1,looks good,the box looks great but everything isnt what it appears to be.I thought it was poorly put together and was pretty watered down
1,For Collectors Only,"It's not a bad cd or anything. It's just not anything different.If you already own the singles and the LPs, then you've got everything this cd has EXCEPT the Had A Dad Demo.The ""demo"" version of Jane Says is actually the same version that is on Nothings Shocking.Just as another reviewer stated, Three Days 1 & 2 is merely a different track marker splitting the song where the song doesn't need to be broken up.I have this disc in my collection, but only because I am a die hard collector. I don't recommend this for the average fan, save your money or try to find it used."
3,Kryptonics Multi-sport helmet and pads,"The quality of the helmet and pads was good. But the sizing information was way off. It was supposed to be a men's medium/large but was a youth size instead...not clear at all when I ordered. I had to send it back and took a hit on super saver shipping for the other item I ordered.I found that most of the helmet sizing on the products I looked at on Amazon was confusing. However, I still love Amazon overall."
2,NOT for MEN,"Looks like a great helmet/pad set, but is not for a regular sized adult. Medium/Large MIGHT be big enough for a 12/13 year old. Too bad."
2,Severely undersized!,"I am average size and this adult combo did not come close to fitting me. Nothing fit. The helmet was way too small. The wrist guards were way to small, and seemed cheap, as were the pads. The helmet seemed good, which is why I gave it two stars. I think this is meant for someone smaller/more petit/female or 10-14 year old. Unfortunately, the entire combo just doesn't cut it. I returned mine. I bought this from [...], through Amazon, and I have to say their customer service was excellent, albeit a bit slow at first. Still, they arranged for a pick up, etc., and had no problem with the return. Obviously, this was not their fault, as they provided the product, and I believe it was the manufacture's fault for not properly describing it accurately. I was easily buy from Dazadi again (and of course Amazon is a no-brainer). Pass on this."
2,Heavy helmat,I can't really recommend this item. My kid who is 9 was not happy with it because the helmat was too heavy. We went to another store and got him a very light helmat for $15 dollars
3,Helmet size is youth(medium\large),"The quality of the product seems alright but the helmet is definitely youth size(not adult size). I ordered the ""meduim/large"" size and it doesn't fit well on my head.If you are looking for adult sized helmet, avoid this one!"
2,Not for adults,"Even though it says that it is an adult size. None of the products were meant for an adult. My 4 year old nephew was able to wear the product. I double checked the size and it was clearly marked adult. However, the helmet was way too small and my semi-toned body didn't leave much room for any of the other pieces. If you have a small head and you are a small build than this is the product for you.Not a one size fits all!!"
2,Did not make a difference for me.,"After making the decision to discontinue my prescribed anti-anxiety/depressant, I researched herbal remedies. I read alot of reviews regarding Passionflower. After trying it for 2 months, I see/feel no difference at all. This product did not work for me."
3,"Good for sleep, but...","For me, Passionflower is best taken during nighttime as a sleep inducer/ enhancer. It is good for those who suffer from insomnia/ have whirling thoughts that prevent them from falling asleep. Experimenting in nights taking with/without it, I am sure that it was passionflower that made dreams more vivid and helped me stay asleep. However, my intention of buying Passionflower wasn't because of sleep, but because of anxiety. Taking this in the morning made my mind groggy and sort of dazed. And a few hours after taking the dose, the 'floating high' wore off and was I back to my normal self. In my opinion, taking passionflower in the morning is inefficient, especially for those who need to be productive for school."
4,powerful,this product works very well for anxiety. for me it was too powerful and gave me a feeling of euphoria. I have since tried full spectrum passion flower which gets rid of the anxiety without making me high.
1,You let me down.,"I had hope that this would work but NO.The first day I took 2 capsules and it kinda made me a little relaxed (I didn't have enough sleep the day before)So I try the next day but it just made me feel more anxious I don't know why.I tried to hold off negative review until I have tried it for the 4th time.I can say that if you have anxiety problems like me(I've had it for years & years)this may not be for you. I want you to try though, cause I heard this may not be for everyone but it could be for you.(it's cheap anyways)I will keep trying this for a couple more times and if the result is positive I will change my review.But for now, it's 1 star for me."
5,Sleep ... ahhh,"Really seems to relax you and help you sleep through the night! Even if i need to wake up to potty, i can go right back to SLEEEEPPP!!!"
4,Good product,I started taking this in addition to L-Theanine. I really can't tell much of a difference to be honest.I really like L-Tryptophan and 5-HTP. All of these combined are a sure fire way to fall asleep quickly!!
1,Im really sorry,"I really don't like to burst people bubbles, or get a person down when they think that they are about to buy a product that is going to be great, but this stuff does not work.Plain and simple, it doesn't work. At all.I'm not sure if the other reviewers are having some hardcore placebo effects or whats going on, but this stuff does absolutely nothing.I took up to 4 pills at once, and I cannot stress enough how ineffective the effects that don't exist in anyway were.Now, you can down-vote this review because it isn't what you want to hear, but Im telling the truth. Why believe me when there are 40 people saying the opposite? I know I wouldn't, but you have to trust me."
2,ineffective for me,I read many positive reviews before purchasing this product. I prefer natural remedies to pharmaceutical medications. I was disappointed when Nature's Answer Passionflower did not work for me.
2,Good for about a year,"I really like the balance and the handle of this knife. However, after about a year, I noticed that the blade is cracking in a few spots. I always hand wash and I don't even cook that often. Also, despite the ""Japanese steel"" the knife is made in China."
4,returnung purchase,Knife needed to be returned to manufactor because of defect. All went well after three week delay.
5,Fantastic,"The first time you view it you may not get it well if you do not understand Russian, and it may seem a little goofy, because it is in Russian with English subtitles, but after you have seen it a few times, you develop a real appreciation for it. It is one of the funniest comedies I have seen, and it is amazing that it came out as it did considering the era in which it was made. All of the actors are fantastic, and after you have really got it, you'll probably want to watch it a few more times, or every now and then, it is a classic."
4,nice luggage set for the price!,This set with 7 accessories is a good buy for the price! I got one and I never tought that could bring so many accessories. Of course they aren't any samsonite... but they do their job.I've already used them to travel and they are strong and the troleys can bring a lot of things.
1,Not happy.,"I ordered a new book and received a very used book. Many pages were missing, it was musty smelling and it had ink writing on some pages. I was very unhappy. Eventually I received a refund."
4,good movie,"Yo, the last reviewer was way off, so just erase those thoughts from your memory. This documentary is raw and refined at the same time. There are interviews with artists such as Snoop Dog, Masta Killa, Sunz of Man, Jadakiss,Sticky Fingaz, etc. The guy making the flick is puffing ""L""s the whole time with the rappers, and just having casual conversation. I thought it was a sick soundtrack with intimate interviews that are informative at least, and incredibly entertaining regardless. Worth checking out, and definitely worth 10 bucks. There aren't enough hip-hop documentaries and this one will be a classic."
5,Rock and roll!,"This CD is great! Elizabeth Elkins has a passionate voice and the band is tight. It reminds me of PJ Harvey sometimes, and also The Pretenders. If you like thoughtful, moody alternative/indie rock, you'll love this CD!"
5,A rare treasure,"This is a wonderful book, a true and rare treasure, full of hunger and appetite, joy and toil. Books like this are sometimes called ""a labor of love"", which is somewhat of a cliche, but this book is brimfull of all the labor and love that goes into gathering, harvesting, preserving and cooking food grown for its own sake. Here, food is not a commodity to be bought and sold but a mainstay of life, a vital ingredient for happiness, a celebration of simple and good - but hard - life. The book would be valuable enough if that was all but there are also so many delightful recipes, so many wonderful anecdotes and descriptions, so much interesting autobiographical material. I've seen someone compare Honey from a Weed to Frances Mayers tedious Tuscanny books but don't let that mislead you; this is a very different book, written with immense sensitivity and hard-earned knowledge of the land the author has cultivated and the people she lived with and learned from."
5,I fell in love again...,"I read this book 20 years ago, as a budding chef. I have just finished it again, and loved it even more. The reviewer who stated, she and her book club couldn't get through it, amazes me. I found it hard to put it down. This book shaped me as a young cook, and now that I Chef my own kitchen, I appreciation it even more. I am often asked by friends, family and strangers to recommend cook books, this is the first book I write down on paper. I love this book."
5,Informative,This book has great details and concepts that plant science majors will need to know. The pictures and diagrams illustrate what you need to learn about plant biology and their physiology. Great book
5,Botany,I received the book in awesome condition. I needed as a textbook for a class and it is pretty easy to understand with online book code that also has resources to help study.
2,Uneven,"Great bass player,but lacks identity.First couple of tracks sound like Zawinul solo stuff.Too much drum machine/Cakewalk sequencing that makes it sound sterile.Best track is Leap, a great jam with Andy Narrel (steel drummer).Nice.About 50 /50 split of some very good and others just mediocre."
3,1001 dreams,Fun for a stocking stuffer but a bit too vague for an actual dream analysis. I gave one as a gift and mine I gave away also since I didn't think it was worth the effort.
4,It does the trick,"I'm not going to spend hours interepreting my dreams. But occasionally, I have a weird one that begs to be investigated. This nightstand copy (5inches x 5 inches) is perfect. A very large index, you can look up key words easily. Most of the time, I've found the meanings to be applicable. On the rare occassion that the book seems to ""miss the mark"" I have still gleaned enough information to form my own interepretation.Although I would not recommend this text to the serious dream analyst, it is great for the average ""joe"" that has a strange dream now and again."
1,very small book.,"it was an alright book. not what i suspected. some information i was looking for that were real easy and common words, i was unable to find. i still ened up giving it to the person i bought it for. it was a awsome price and cool lil book."
1,"Not jumbo or worthy of name ""Texas""",This pan was the same size as a regular muffin pan. Nothing Texas about it :(. Great quality pan but I was looking for a true jumbo muffin pan.
3,Muffin pans too big for most toaster ovens.,"Be advised that the dimensions stated are wrong. These muffin pans are 12-1/2"" by 8-1/2"" by 1-1/2 inches -- too large for my 12-inch ""large capacity"" Delonghi Toaster Oven. It has been difficult to find muffin pans that will fit inside a toaster oven. These pans are well constructed, just a pity they aren't 1/2 inch shorter."
4,nice size muffins,"I really like this muffin pan and the size muffins it makes. A recipe for 12 regular ones will work perfectly in this. I'm gluten free and wanted a bigger muffin to have one for a quick breakfast, and didn't want to have to make them so often (I freeze them and pull one out when needed). I just ordered a second pan so I can make double batches at once."
4,"Jumbo, they are","Perfect size for mini pot pies, or mini banana bread muffins. The pan is sturdy, well made, and cleans easily."
5,Great holiday purchase!,"I got this for my boyfriend at Christmas and he loved it! They are perfect for cooking sticky buns. I would buy anything from baker's secret. They put out good, quality products!"
5,Muffin Pans,These pans are just what we needed. Everyone love the blueberry muffins I make in these pans. Glad I bought several.
1,Flaky Performance,"I bought this muffin pan a few weeks ago. I have only used it twice, and tonight it went in the garbage. The first time I used it, I baked a batch of chocolate chip muffins. The so-called ""nonstick"" surface is garbage. The bottoms of some of the muffins were destroyed because they stuck. I was very upset, but decided I'd try again another time. So, last night I decided to bake some cornmeal muffins. This time I sprayed the inside of each cup with Pam so that nothing would stick. Well, the muffins didn't stick at all...instead half of them came out with some sort of a metallic film on them. It had flaked off of the inside of the muffin tin. I will never consciously buy another Baker's Secret product. What's the secret? They're garbage!"
5,nice size muffin pan,"The Texas muffin pan is great. Non-stick coating makes muffins slip right out of pan. Makes a true Texas sized muffin, not a pop over."
3,Are these pans seconds?,"While I hate to speak ill of a muffin pan that only costs $3.99, including super saver shipping, and is included in the 4 for 3 special, I will. There are little dents in the bottoms of the muffin cups. This came very well packaged, so I think that the dents were there originally and not caused by shipping. Because of the low cost of the item, general hassle, plus it probably won't affect the overall baking of muffins, I'm not returning it. It's just that the pan arrived not looking new because of all the little dents, and I'm not sure that asking for another one would produce better results. On the positive side, this pan is warranteed for five years, so if the dents do cause a problem, I can return it to the manufacturer."
5,Wow!,I was so impressed. It actually came 2 weeks earlier than what it had stated. I was so surprised when it showed up at my door! The product is exactly what I wanted! It was a Christmas gift and it was perfect!
5,Great Muffins!!!!,I have used this new tin several times now and absolutely no sticking. I love the size. V
1,Not worth the money,"I bought this as a primer for electric airplanes, but there wasn't enough information on the power systems to be even a review. I'm glad I got it for 5.99 + shipping-even that was too much."
3,A bit dated but OK,The book is not too deep I would have liked a little more detail on the subject but it provided some information I was interested in
3,how to build and fly electric model aircraft,not what i expected...i am a first time builder there is not enought basic instructions for afirst time builder.flying comes later
3,karate video,Dont use a video to learn karate. it is a nice experience to watch an individual with such powerful and graceful movements.
2,Not what I expected,"While there was nothing technically wrong with the presentation, I didn't find it at all useful. No real explanation, no flow. A waste of money IMHO."
1,disappointed,I regret buying this DVD. the kata are not executed as they supposed to be.. this dvd sucks
1,orange display freezing up,"the screen display started freezing up so I had to pull the battery out ,this has been happing for month's. 2 hand set phone it was happening to both phones.they would work fine other times. then when I wanted to dial out it would freeze up the display & it would not dial or shut off. I got to get another phone now.I'm upset"
1,Not what I thought,"This lube is advertised as silicone lube. I thought it would be like Gun Oil silicone or ID Meleniam but it's not. When I got it it was the standard fast drying and sticky glycyren lube we've been getting for years. I says it's silicone based on the label but it's not it's glycyren based, silicone is the last ingrediant. I would give it to one of my lady friends but I've heard recently that glycerine based lubes can increase the chance of yeast infections. They have come up with better non-glycerine water based lubes to they just cost more, J/O makes an excellent one. This is a cheap inferior product I think I got ripped off so I hope I can return it. My advice don't buy it."
5,great for the price,"been hooked on this ever since i tryed it, last long , feels great, defiently the price is right, VERY HAPPY!!!!!!"
1,Double plus ungood!,"False labeling!Main ingredient: Glycerine. The very last ingredient is silicone. (And if you didn't know, ingredients are listed in descending order of predominance by weight, per an FDA requirement.)Unlike with real silicone lube, you can't use just a few drops."
5,happy to hear this,"I heard Maurice Brown in New Orleans at the Jazz Fest. The first time in 2007 and this year. In fact, I made it a point to catch his set this year. He's great. He's got a good, solid group. They all enjoy the music and his enthusiasm is catching. They can play everything. It's so good to hear young kids who HAVE IT."
2,Sent to repair shop first week,"I debated on getting a product like this but since I'm sweeping and hand-washing my floor several times a day due to having small children, I figured it was worth a shot. Within 2 days of having it, the cleaning solution simply disappeared. When I was pouring in a new bottle, it started pouring right back out of a hole. I was told by Dirt Devil (Royal) to take it to a local vacuum shop. They are replacing the entire unit but it will take a few weeks.So, I really don't know how well it works since I only got 1-2 uses out of it before the spillage incident."
2,dirt devil needs more engineering?,I purchased the vac n mop recently and am dissapointed to say the least!! First the solution container leaks.Second the only place to find the soap solution and the pads are on the dirt devil website.I also bought this same product for a family member for Christmas at Kohl's.Why sell the vac n mop at stores but not sell the pads or cleaner solution there also.All other brands such as Bissel sell both the product and acessores.I read a lot of reviews before I purchased it and they said the same thing about the vac n mop. LEAKS AND CANNOT FIND PADS AND SOLUTION.
1,unfinished good idea,"the dirt devil ce4500 vacn'mop is a great idea but it does not work very well jet. It does not have enougth power to vacum, the tank leaks and is really heavy. I'm not happy with it. i would like to returned."
1,Going Back to my Swiffer Mop,"I had been wanting one of these for a while. We have a lot of tile flooring and I had been using a Swiffer mop, which was pretty good. The Vac n Mop is pretty much useless. The vacuum part does not get much dirt up and the mopping pads are very thin and leave streaks of dirt all over the floor.I would not recommend this product to anyone unless they want to mop an already clean floor.Another thing to add to my appliance graveyard!"
2,Not the mop for me!,"Sorry guys but this mop has some serious problems. I used the vacuum and that worked fine but after just one mop, I woke up the next morning to find an entire new bottle of cleaner all over my floor. I sent it back and I didn't even bother to get a replacment. I read all the feedback and decided even though some of the feedback talks about the leak problem I went ahead and tried my luck anyway. Thanks Amazon for having such a great return policy, you guys rock but this mop does not!"
5,I LOVE MINE! The answer to a new mother's prayers,"I absolutely love mine and have had none of the issues discussed by fellow feedback'ers. It worked from day 1 - the pads are great, the suction is sufficient, it's lightweight so I can vacuum/mop WITH a baby on my hip. I use this at least daily - sometimes multiple times. Holds it's charge...there is nothing bad I can say about my unit. In fact, my sister just bought a new house - and has a large hairy dog - and her downstairs is all tile/pergo - I'm buying her one as a housewarming gift!"
1,Dissatisfaction with battery life,"My husband purchased the Vac'N'Mop as a tool to minimize the amount of time that I spend cleaning kitchen and bathroom floors. At first the product seemed to be the answer to my cleaning needs. I charged the product as indicated for 24 hours before the first use and used the product without complaint. The product sat for a few days before the next use and when I attempted to use the vacuum, the battery died shortly after turning it on. I re-charged the battery and attempted to use the product again, only to find that within minutes the battery was dead again. I called customer service and was informed that the battery life is 9-13 minutes. Well I don't know about you, but 9-13 minutes is not enough time for me to vacuum the kitchen floors much less mop them. I will be returning the product and going back to the tried and true method of sweeping and them mopping until I find a product that will meet my requirements."
3,"Good idea, not dependable though","I have two young kids and was thrilled to find a product that would help with the seemingly constant messes around our house...particularly in the kitchen. I especially liked the vacuum; it was pretty lightweight and easy to use. It was very effective at picking up general dirt and cat hair and was great for quick cleanups during the day. I was excited to find a product that I could fill with my own preferred cleaning solution (vinegar & water). Unfortunately, I only got to enjoy using it for a week before the sprayer gave out and I had to return it. I've had this happen within 6 months on the Swiffer Wetjet too, so I've given up on all of the spray mops for now. I decided that since I like the vacuum/dry sweeper combo so much that I'm opting for the plain Dirt Devil Sweeper Vac. I'll just use the Swiffer-type wet cloths with it."
2,Not dependable,"I've had this product for 4 months. At first it was great, plugging in to recharge constantly is a small inconvenience, but one I can live with. I couldn't find replacement pads in our local Walmart, and the cleaning solution is difficult to find as well.Within two months the spray nozzle had broken off. I superglued it back on, the spray action wasn't as good but it still worked. Today a screw broke off - yes a screw. I'm not sure I can fix it...I'll be returning this item to the manufacturer and hope I can get some money back. I believe I'll be returning to brooms and swifter wet jets...those seem to work and are much less expensive."
1,"Dissapointed ""Vac n' Mop"" Owner","The Vac n' Mop sounded like such a great idea - no cords, one piece of equipment for debris and spots. I did not intend to use it for a complete mopping but for in-between spot cleanings.It worked well twice. On the third time the mechanism sounded like it was working but the solution was not dispensed. According to the trouble shooting guide, this was one of the problems that required a call to the repair line. I did not feel that an appliance requiring a repair call after two uses was in my best interest.Since the purchase was made during a period of time that my husband has hospitalized three times, I did not make return arrangements within the 30-days allowed. The cost for this mistake was a 15% restocking charge.I am not sure if I just happened to get a bad one or if it is the nature of the critters. I probably will not try another one so I will never know.Ginnie"
1,"Oh, boy, what a problem","I bought this mop several months ago and thought I'd hold off on the review until I saw how it lasted. What a disappointment. It does leak, as has been mentioned before. The piece that holds the squirt nozzle in place broke off and I have to keep realigning it by hand. All this with average use. The replacement pads and liquid are difficult to find, in any store. Save your money and look at something else."
1,Not Good Buy,"I bought this VAC/MOP recently and I am very upset that I did. The mop part of it works o.k. at best. The vac part is not worth anything. I threw some dirt on my carpet and the dirt wasn't even pushed down in the carpet and the Vacum could on get abuot 40%, it pushed as much in the carpet as it picked up. If you plan on using this only inthe kitchen or on hardwood floors I guess it is an O.K. buy but if you want to be able to clean up little messes elsewhere in your home forget this, it is a waist of money at best."
2,Not worth it.,I bought this an was very excited to eliminate the dustbuster and swiffer to go with one cleaning tool. But it did not work well and I lost the adapter to charge it after about a month. Can't find an adapter to replace it and I don't want to pay a lot for a new one. So this purchase was basically useless for me.
4,This book has a lot of great information,"I found this book by Meltzer very informative with a lot of great facts from history. Not only does he tell about many events in history of witch craft, but also shows how they are all connected together. Meltzer is a great author that potrays the way things should be seen at least in his eyes. The book is well formatted with end notes in each chapter and a bibliography at the end of the book. I would recommend this book to someone wanting to know the history aspect of the witch trials. I enjoyed this book throughly and I hope anyone else that reads it does too!"
5,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL...!!!!!!!!!!,"WOW!!!Miss Brightman's Voice is just Amazing, This time Sarah sings POP!!! And is an excellent pop with an incredible music quality. I love this CD, is one of my favourites, Is a CD to be played at night maybe with friends, at a party or at a Disco!!! It includes fantastic songs like YOU TAKE MY BREATH AWAY (My Favourite One) with a Kind of Indian rythm, very sensual...!!!Another Song is ""Question of Honour"", where she combines Techno pop with a few parts of an Opera Aria called ""Ebben Ne andró lontana"" It is just terrific!!!And my other Favourite song is ""Murder in Mayriland Park"", a sad and melancholy song played in the piano by Sarah.It Also includes Wonderful songs like ""I Loved you"" (I think it has a hip-hop rythm) Something in the Air, Fly and many others.If you like POP this is a CD for you.Miss Brightman's voice is absolutely amazing as always, but this time she is not the Sarah as in Phantom, Surrender, or The Songs that Got Away.VIVA LA BRIGHTMAN!!!"
5,Sigh........,"This CD was my favorite Sarah B CD.....that was before I started listening to Time To Say Goodbye again. I still like it deeply, though."
3,"Fly carefully, Sarah, because...","I received this album as a Christmas gift. Nice cover with spideresque backgrounds look like she wanna dance. To an extent, she delivers more pop than dance. My favorite song on this 1996 European smash hit is ""A Question of Honour."" This clearly is reminiscent of Sarah's disco days with Hot Gossip and of her future hits like ""Time To Say Goodbye"" at the same time. Otherwise, it would be better if Sarah made a Greatest Hits album with that song on there."
5,"Buy Fly, then stop","Sarah Brightman rocks the house in Fly, but if you're looking for more like it in her other CDs, be very, very, careful. I've bought a handful of her other works and they are uniformly treacle. I've not found anything yet that touches Fly."
5,Fly upon the dulcet tones of Sarah Brightman,"We all have gifts and one of Ms. Brightman's is her singing. I join my voice with the other reviewers who have praised this album. It's an incredible, enjoyable album. This album showcases her talent, the range of her voice and styles, and is an absolute pleasure to listen to."
2,Something went wrong!,"I was very disappointed with this album! Nothing wrong with the music or the way Sarah sings it, I simply dislike the content, the lyrics! A song about a fly is hardly my cup of tea! The only song I did like was Question of Honour.If you are a fan of Sarah and don't have my prejudice, then you will undoubtedly love this album!"
2,Fly Away from this new CD :(,"I honestly cannot stand the fact that people think that this CD is one of the greatest from Sarah Brightman ever! I cannot stand her singing like the 80s song ""Barbie Girl"". Her voice is now so ""nasaly"" that it's almost impossible to listen to her. The one and only best track on the album has to be ""A Question of Honour"", for it shows off Brightman's operatic ability. I just can't take the Pop Sarah! Please, someone convince her to go back to classical! I would dissuade you from buying this CD because it is almost unbearable to listen to! If you want something that sounds like the old Sarah from The Phantom of the Opera, then purchase the sound track or buy Surrender - The Unexpected Songs."
5,Very Enjoyable,"I first listened to this CD over 12 years since its release. I have always been a Sarah Brightman fan, but never have listened to this CD. I love her latest cd Symphoney so I thought I would get this old cd. I love this one as well. Her style is very original as her voice. JRay"
1,Cass..,"Wow...I am so disappointed with this purchase! They are very SMALL you need a magnifying glass to see them and they definitely would not survive my 4 year old. For the project I am doing, this was a waist of time and money!"
5,"Finally, a book that clearly explains the three main views.",This book is excellent! A must read if you are a serious end times reader.
3,Great video but not appropriate for school setting,"The video is terrific and kids will love it! Entertaining and informative video about line. Unfortunately, the portion with the Bart Simpson artist is inappropriate for a school setting and must be skipped over."
3,Ukk,"Yuck, don't get the cookies and creme. It tastes gross. It smells great at first but it has a really bad taste. As a gainer I don't see how this is worth it. This product has 54g of protein and 580 calories and 3g of creatine BUT ONLY at 4 scoops giving it 18 servings per container. So divide that by 4 and it has about 13g of protein and 145 calories in one scoop. To put that into perspective I have a Optimum Nutrition's 100% Whey Gold Standard protein powder and it has 24g of protein and 120 calories at ONE SCOOP. Sure Cytogainer has more calories but definitely not much. There is a bunch of extra stuff in Cytogainer as well but I already have a multivitamin for that and a creatine powder. It's decent but I would rather have an extra tub of whey protein in this case."
1,Works but tastes bad,"It has all the right ingredients and does what it advertises but I much rather spend my cold hard cash on Monster Milk, Monster Milk tastes much better! And it even works better in my opinion. Cytosport originally was manufactured first then came Monster Milk on the market so they still have to make Cytosport or sell off whats left thats why I bought some but I will stick with Monster Milk for now on, you can't go wrong."
1,it isn't what it claims to be,"Firstly, the product I received came with a different labelling that of the advertised 6 pound container at amazon, though it still read Cyto Gainer lean mas builder. I am Lactose intolerant and specifically chose this product based on the labelling shown on the site claiming to be 98% lactose free. I got the runs, stomach cramps and had to miss a day very important activity since I had to stay home. I can't return it because it cost me quite a hefty penny to ship 6 pounds express all the way to Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean. How can you advertise one product with completely two different properties?"
5,Best Protein Shake I've taken.,"It's the best in my book, taste better than any I've taken and most important it works. The only con is that it does give you a little gas, as does most concentrate protein. Helps me recover from hard workouts and it helps pack on lean muscle."
1,Not impressed,"I bought this product and being a professional fabricator and mechanic I figured the description would be correct. To begin with it doesn't fit, The bolts are not near long enough, the angles are wrong to incorporate into existing exhaust system and it would clear the shift linkage on a column shift without significant modification. There's also no instruction on were to relocate the power steering return hose(which rubs against the header) and could cause a major fire."
2,Aluminum Pistol Bolts,"This 12-pack is a great deal for the price. However, I was hoping that the bolts would come with threaded or screwed-on heads instead of glued-on heads. The threaded version holds up much better for longer use. Unfortunately this version of the pistol bolts came with glued-on heads."
1,Terrible Product,"These bolt break as soon as they are fired, even when shot from low-poundage crossbows. The cheap plastic fletching is held onto the aluminum bolt with (what appears to be) super glue. The fletching is one solid piece of plastic that is not connected to the aluminum in any way except by glue. I thought that the past reviews were probably just from overly-picky buyers, but I was so wrong. Do NOT buy these bolts if you want anything that you can shoot more than once - or shoot straight/sight in. Not even worth the two dollars.Also, attempted to contact the company (per their request) but their email is no longer listed and they never answered the phone."
2,crossbow bolts,"these bolts are not very durable, i fired one into a folded carpet backstop, and when i tried to pull it back out, the plastic fins separated from the aluminum front of the bolt... cheap enough but notwell made at all"
2,dangerous,i used these in a 50lb crossbow and the black plastic parts broke off and flew near my face. i bought these for use by my 16 year old son. I'm glad i tested them first.
4,Sharp lil buggers,Wicked sharp eh? ( This is in a British accent )Sharp.Bolts.Crossbow.Yes.Cheap price but they do the job well. The back end is made from plastic and will break after one or two shots.SO DON'T MISS.- Farrell
5,Great Pistol Bolts,My kids have used these for 2 days and they have withstood all of the neighborhood abuse! They have worked well with a target on a bale of hay.
2,Not as great as I'd hoped,"Broke 2 within the first couple days, the shaft and tip are fairly strong, fletching is alot weaker, some came apart just pulling them out of a cardboard/phonebook target, though this was easily fixed by superglue, some actually broke at the metal and were unrepairable. While the ABS versions are not quite as durable, there are less pieces to break and are a bit cheaper, until I can find a decent metal bolt, or a way to make better fletching for these, I will be using the ABS bolts."
3,a online shopper,prossing and shipping was slow 4 bolts had lose tips must reglue 3 bolts had lose tails also must reglue but all in all for the price they will do.
3,Ok for the price,Ok for the price but you get what you pay for. Half of them fell apart after first shot. The plastic part separates from aluminum body. You can glue it back though. But the plastic fits so loosely in the aluminum shaft that even straight out of the box they are crooked. And needles to say crooked arrow is not accurate. The arrows that are made entirely from plastic with a metal tip are much better. They look cheap but at least they are straight and accurate.
1,DON'T,"they break VERY easily, when they penetrate a slightly hard surface (a hard tree for instance) the black part pops out...I could almost say these bolts are for only one shot. However, the problem may be that my pistol crossbow (80lb) is too powerful for these..."
4,10 pack aluminum bolts for crossbow,I haven't shot them yet but they seem strong and they are sharp at the point. The only concern I have is the lack of a nocking point on the tail and the fact that the fins are a tough plastic we'll see how it goes after I get my crossbow.
1,And we wonder what's wrong with kids these days?,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!My 2 1/2 year old and I were watching Rugrats on Nickelodeon and this commercial popped up. I was so disgusted this company targets girls ages 6-10. My jaw dropped.You really need to see this commercial...little 9 or 10 year old dressing up for a secret date wearing a cut off shirt and a pound of make up. A - she doesn't even know who she is going out with and B - the song they use in the ad is very seductive.Manufacturer's age: 6 years and upLet's read that manufacturers suggested age and the product description above one more time, shall we?""He remains a mystery until you've taken him home""""A night you're sure to never forget""WHAT? I swear I am waiting for the punch line here.Can the world stop throwing sex in a little girl's face for 5 seconds please!?"

5,"Wonderful, inspiring, illustrations","This book should never go out of print. It has the most beautiful illustrations and the stories are told in a charming condenced manner. Each story includes a note or two about the music, some history, original dancers, and practical tips. For example, a note is made in the Swan Lake story indicating that the bow which was to be used to shoot the swans was too heavy for the dancer. He had to change his balance and lower his jumps when he danced with that particular prop. I am a ballet teacher and I have seen many children's ballet books, this one is at the top of my list."
5,Christmas gift,More ballet books for my daughter. I had read this in my school library and knew that she had to have it.
2,Not for thick hair,"I have coarse hair and was looking for a lightweight brush, so I splurged on this one. Unfortunately,my hair is very thick and the bristles aren't long enough to get through my hair. I have to brush in sections. Anyway, I ended up giving it to my daughter. Disappointing."
4,YOU SIMPLY HAVE TO READ IT!,"THIS BOOK IS A VERY EASY ONE TO READ SINCE IT CAPTURES YOU FROM THE FIRST MOMENT ON. BUT I CAN'T SAY THE SAME FOR THE LATER PART SINCE AFTER THE 3 FIGURES(HAYYAM, ABBAS AND NIZAMULMULK) DISAPPEAR THE BOOK TURNS INTO A VERY REGULAR ONE WHICH LOOSES ITS HISTORIC NATURE."
5,What a great book?,"Simply, everything written by amin malouf is deserve to read, its a greT book with great real story, full of historical informatioin and interedst novel, cant stop reading it many times.recommended highly, such a great book."
5,engrossing,"lyrical and moving, this is an extraordinary narrative intertwining poetry, politics, history, life and love. lock your door and get reading..."
5,Wow,"I was assigned this book to read for my Islamic Civilization class. At first I wasn't going to read it because, well, I felt I just didn't have the time. I had nothing to do one evening last week so I sat down and figured I'd give the book a try. Boy, am I ever glad I picked up Samarkand. It is a lively, somewhat romantic read, packed with adventure and intrigue. Two thumbs up."
4,Thought Provoking,"I only picked up the book because of FitzGerald's Rubaiyat and was happily surprised. The only two observations I would add to other reviews here are, first, that the novel was translated from French into English and so may lose some elegance and effect. Perhaps that's the origin of someone's remark, ""surprisingly dry""? Second, I enjoyed the way the fictionalized characters were drawn from actual history, Medieval and modern, and how characters in the early history had thought provoking parallels in the modern story. So, I came away moved by the question of how different types of people influence history, or art, or the people around them. And the story opens a door into Persian history, including Islam, for those of us in the West who had little or no idea of it before."
5,Un triste novela por mujeres que tienen 49 anos,Senor Pepino es una novela por mujeres que tienen 49 anos. Le hara sonolieto. Es bien por insomnes. Es horrible.
4,For the TRUE Doors fan...,"This is a great must-have for the TRUE Doors fan.. not those looking for only ""pretty-boy"" Jim Morrison footage...though, to give Ray Manzarek credit -he did include in the first half some of Morrison at his peak (looks-wise) to make this more appealing to the ""fair-weather fans"". But I must insist if a bearded, getting pudgy, Beefeater Gin and large bag of potato chips eating, stogie smoking Morrison is not your thing -DO NOT invest in this DVD!"
1,Awful,I was looking forward to seeing the doors perform their music on DVD but was disappointed. The audio is extremely poor on all the PBS performances. Not the Doors at their best. The only highlight is The Doors performance of 'the end' at the CBC in Toronto. Everthing else should never have been put on disc.
5,An All-Time Classic!,"I highly recommend this album who wants to hear the sound of greats from Duke, Count, Satchmo, Miles, Quincy, Wynton, Coltrane, Bird, Mingus, Billie or Lady Day, Ella, etc.This albums has everybody from Arturo Sandoval, Randy Brecker, Tom Scott, Dave Grusin, Chuck Findley, Eric Marienthal, Nelson Rangell, George Bohannon, the late Kenny Kirkland, Eddie Daniels, the list goes on and on.I still have it on tape but ready to cop it CD. I still have the 1st one they put out which was awesome but I still lost the tape but ready to get it on CD too for example.I love this record to death. It brings back good memories from the jazz era.This is my inspirations I grew up as a interest in jazz and other genres in the music area."
4,A midwintersdawn fantasy,"As a playwright Ostrovsky is the Russian Shakespeare. Here we have something akin to ""A Midsummernight's Dream,"" only with superb Russian folk singing thrown into the mix. Yes, it all can seem very stilted to western audiences, but remember that this is pretty important theater being filmed. Wonderful atmospherics and direction reminiscent of Bergman and Pasolini make this a lot of fun. I just wish the soundtrack were available."
3,good enough,"I bought this dictionary because I love the French one, but I was disappointed with this one. It has most of the words I look up but in the english to spanish section it doesn't tell you the gender of the word, so you have to look it up in the spanish section. I assume that the author expected the user to know, or be able to figure out the gender, but speaking more french than spanish, I am never sure. Otherwise, a nice little dictionary that nearly replaces a bigger one."
1,Good services in Amazon but .....,"Amazon is a wonderfull,efficiency and smart website for to buy.There are good services in Amazon but...there are some products with bad quality as this one""Alphabet City""."
1,Vacuous and Vapid attempt to Recreate the Magic of Ellington,"If I want to listen to Duke Ellington I can get out my Blanton-Webster band set and listen to music that is vital, creative, and absolutely of the moment in which it was created.I absolutely do not want to hear Marsalis'pathetic attempt to re-create the Ellington band's magic at the end of the 20th century. Duke Ellington never attempted such a bland and rote re-creation of an earlier style of music and is probably rolling over in his grave at this crass attempt to channel up his timeless music.If you want to hear creative repertory music - check out the Mingus Big Band - not this drivel."
4,My Baker's secret,"These pans are basic, non-stick cake pans. They are nice pans at a nice price. For baking I will use these every time. I Have used this inexpensive bakeware for years. Never had a problem with it."
5,Good Product - Moderately Priced,"Have not used yet for a cake, but they make good biscuit pans; 8-inch round is perfect size for regular size (2 3/4 inch??) biscuits. The dark color gives a nice crunch to the biscuits. Although instructions allow using dishwasher, I'm going to stick to hand washing. They're non-stick and easy to clean. The rim protrudes on 2 sides and makes very convenient and useful handles. Good stuff!"
3,Eight inches? Really?,"Last week I made one of my favorite cakes with a recipe that specifies 8"" x 1.5"" pans. I've made it before in nine inch pans but you end up with pancakes rather than nicely shaped cakes. When I used these pans, I seemed to have too much batter, and hating to waste anything, had an overflow in the oven during cooking! What a mess.Curious, I measured these pans, and found they are eight inches across the top, but because they're tapered, are only seven inches diameter at the base. Considering the bottom half of the pan is where the batter goes, perhaps the manufacturer's measurement is misleading?I'm not returning them though, as the non-stick surface works and they feel nice and solid."
3,Average,"Many of my recipes call for 9 inch pans, but a recent one specified an 8-in. Pans are average, price paid was very good. Not sure how much use I will get out of them but they will be available when needed. Quality seems okay."
4,Your Basic Cake Pan,This is a great basic cake pan--it works and it is the right size for certain cakes. It's one of the staples all bakers should have in the kitchen.
4,"Good, easy to clean and functional.","This product is easy to clean, functional, and looks good. I like the fact that it is really easy to clean."
4,No review - Item never received so I finally had to cancel,"I'm giving this item 4 stars because the 9"" pan I did receive I like. Amazon was supposed to send me the 8"" pan in a separate delivery but after weeks of waiting I canceled the order."
4,Hard to find,"I searched many stores in my area for 8"" cake pans to no avail. All they had were 9""! I was so happy to find the 8"" pans on Amazon. The pans are sturdy and nest nicely within one another for easy storage."
5,My favorite baking pan,"I've used Baker's Secret pans for years, and now, suddenly, I can't find them in the stores in my area. So I came to Amazon and bought two. I use these pans for cornbread mainly, as the eight inch pan will give a thick pan of cornbread even though you might not be cooking a large amount. They're light weight, cook evenly, and are easy to clean up. If you use canned spray oils (like Pam or Bakers Secret) you will get a gummy build up around the top of the pan that can't be cleaned off. They will still cook just fine, but they get dirty looking after awhile. I generally replace my pans every eighteen months or so because I do use spray oils. So that's on me, but the pans are durable. They should be hand washed, because if you put them in the dishwasher, it will cause food to start sticking in them. I will definitely buy again."
3,"8"" round cak pan","I love the fact that it is 8"" as this is a difficult size to find. The quality is fine, but the pan itself is a bit thin."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"Nielsen nonghead to the max.A political satire and adventure you could call this. The president wants to junk the national debt. A senator gets brain damaged and becomes chipped enabling reactions of people to be tracked. Scary cabals, suits, marketers, and more in this very entertaining book. No-fun good guys, fun bad guys, whacky politicians, your usual bent politicians and even the odd average person."
5,The best book I have read in a very long time,This book was so funny. I have never read a book from cover to cover with such joy.
4,Wickedly funny!!!,"This novel is a wonderful parody of the political process,I laughed until I cried! The ending might be simplistic, butits worth reading. The writing is solid, the subject isinteresting. You'll finish the novel and wonder to yourselfif an entity such as 'The Network' really exists!"
4,Thinking man's politician becomes thinking machine.,"Anyone who wondered how Bill Clinton manages to say the right things, to the right audience, at the right moment, need look no farther than ""Interface."" This cautionary tale is a political nightmare-come-true story for the 21st Century, because if it hasn't happened yet, folks, it surely will. A society that turns out Dick Morrises and Joe Waldholzes in continuous series certainly can incubate the characters who run William Cozzano's ""interface."" Forget ""Primary Colors II."" This is THE political novel of the 1996 campaign. That it is largely unknown is the reading public's misfortune"
4,A political power play with maximum media manipulation.,"When a bunch of invisible global financiers decide to made a takeover bid for the US presidency they employ neuro-technology while manipulating the media to the logical hilt. This book is not only a flood of not too distant ideas, it is an outrageous hoot of a read. Students of media, politics and finance should consider this a set text. Everybody else should just enjoy."
4,"Not pure Stephenson, true--but excellent nonetheless","Having devoured Neal Stephenson's entire canon, I turned to Interface desperate for more...and I was not disappointed. While not nearly as good as Snow Crash or the undefeatable Cryptonomicon, I would consider this a better read than The Diamond Age, Zodiac, or, lord help us all, The Big U (which, incidentally, was almost inexpressibly disappointing). The author(s) compile all of the most terrifying elements of political campaigning into one monstrously capable character, toss in some day-after-tomorrow science, and ground it all in a base of likeable, human characters. If the other (out of print) Bury books are half as good, I won't stop until I've hunted them both down."
5,Well done!,"My apologies for taking so long on this review. The book got stuck at the post office for a while.I was very pleased with this seller. He sent me a book marked in ""new"" condition, but that said it hadn't even been read yet. Given that, I had some expectation that it might have a scuff here or there, and I wasn't concerned about that. But when I got the book, included was a note of apology, saying that the book was in a condition that he felt was worse than he had thought and was willing to refund me my money, including shipping both ways! I had no problem with its condition (really, there was hardly a noticeable thing wrong with it), but just the offer was great. Thank you very much! :)"
5,Neal Stephenson Fans! He co-wrote this!,"Neal Stephenson (Snowcrash, Diamond Age, Cryptonomicon) is a co-author of this book. This makes it worth reading. I don't know who the other author is. I read it a while ago & can't remember any details, except that I really liked it."
4,Replaces some VHS tapes you might already have,"At first, I thought this was a lot of repetition from the Golden Greats DVD since many of the skits seemed familiar. However, four VHS tapes of a different collection I have are in this DVD, so I will free up shelf space with this collection. There are a lot of skits on this DVD, many of them very short. This is classic Benny Hill, and a good addition to the collection for Benny Hill fans. If you are a Benny Hill fan, you will want this DVD; if not then it won't matter. This DVD may not contain the best of Benny Hill, but it does contain a lot of Benny Hill."
4,Benny Hill Classics,"A great DVD that covers most of Bennys styles; has about 1/3rd short skits-slapstick & the other 2/3rds his demented ""musicals"", somewhat randomly intermixed, but the further you go, the newer the material is. Some skits are re-made from older ones; nothing lost here, just a more modern rendition."
3,have asked for refund,hihave sent email to seller regarding state of dvdcompany was going to send refund to paypalgordon
5,Late 80s revisited,Great video with a couple of episodes from the late 80s cartoon series C.O.P.S. Lots of fun and some pretty good animation brought to you by the folks at DIC animation.
1,hard core madonna fans only,"if you have the soundtrack to Evita, then you have this CD. Unless you want eveyr single Madonna record ever released, just get the soundtrack. The other singles from Evita aren't useless, since You Must Love Me's title track is longer than the album version and Don't Cry For ME Argentina has the dance remixes"
5,More than a gangster movie...,"It's really about conflict resolution - how one person resolves his personal conflicts (his internal angst over betrayal of others, betrayal of his own beliefs and the validity of those beliefs), his conflicts with others (the external action) and, to some degree, his conflict with God (that's the whole point of Terry's/Penn's discussion regarding grace and the quality or state of it) because you see him struggling with and trying to reconcile what he's sworn to do vs. the ethical/moral implications of his actions filtered through his own spiritual/religious beliefs. What man would have him do to his ""brother"" violates what God would supposedly have him do as a Christian/Catholic. It's a brilliant character study, and not just of Terry, but also Jack - Gary Oldman's character. Jack is the perfect foil for Terry, and in some ways, is more deserving of viewer sympathy.A final note, the film is beautifully shot - so why isn't it on DVD yet?"
4,Violent And Realistic Melodrama,"Released around the same time along with other gangster filmslike ""GOODFELLAS"" ""MILLER'S CROSSING"" But did not recieve muchattention and it's a shame because it's a great film. Sean Pennstars As a cop who feels the burnout from undercover policework inflatrating an irish mob returns after ten years and findshimself in over his head becoming what he fears most a IrishGangster. Top Notch cast features Penn's wife Robin WrightEd Harris and Gary Oldman who almost steels the show as a drukensuicidel Gangster with a vicsious meansteak... A great film with a lot of strong versatile actors portraying their roles with the utmost of profinceny. I Beleive this film is more appreciated now that the people involved in this production have gone on to do bigger and better films."
3,Since Phil Joanou...,"...was a 'protege' of Steven Spielberg, he should have been taught that slow-motion is something to be used when it's useful, and not (ab)used to make up for his shortcomings (and making the movie unnecessarily longer). Mr. Joanou should be very grateful to the stars, since he owes to them not to get a ""0"", since his own work (?) will get me seeing nothing more from him (unless he learns something about his trade, which I doubt he can do). And I think too that Mr. Spielberg should know better than to sponsor any jerk who should have kept making TV crap (sorry for the redundancy), for which I deem this Joanou is very well suited."
2,didn't like it,"Without revealing anything about the movie, I did not like it because it was unrealistic, especially the Gary Oldman character.These are gangsters that do anything in broad daylight, without any planning, without any regards to getting caught?! Undercover officers that reveal their identity?! PLEASE!The movie was of quality simply because of the strength of the big name actors but the acting, story, editing (the parade montage was annoying) special effects (the shootings weer overdramatic) and very wooden charactors were not indicative of a superior film.This film is grossly overrated."
5,The duty against the friendship!,"Three visions ; three gazes , three generations , three points of view . The Yuppie Generation who live in The Kitchen's hell ; a police and a mobster .The cop -Sean Penn is sent to New York and will meet again with his childhood friends but the life has invited them to complete the circle of the life .A stunning film where the job , the feelings , the duty , the betray , the honour and the merciless violence intersect searing the screen. Full blooded film but filmed with superb good taste .Arresting angle shots where you remember some bits of The Citizen Kane , superb illumination , and solid script make of this one of the three best mob films in 1990 - with Goodfellas and Crossing Miller .The cast is fine but Gary Oldman shines with the light of a Supernova in this case . His role is the most complex to follow due the multiple spirit states demanded .Phil Joanou is a gifted director who should be kept in mind for next releases ."
4,Great and gritty mob movie,"This is one of my all time favorite mobster movies. You have a great cast of actors including Sean Penn, Ed Harris, John Turturro, John C. Reilly, Robin Wright and Gary Oldman. This is Gary Oldman's movie by a mile and if you appreciate the man and you haven't seen this film, you need to put this one on priority. Definitely an overlooked gem and well worth two hours of your life.The DVD for the film is okay. The picture is crisp and the audio is a pretty decent 5.1 surround mix. The only special feature is the theatrical trailer which in my opinion is way too revealing. Other than that, I can't really complain about this disc being that it's being sold for so cheap. Definitely worth at least a look."
4,Fast service,"This brand new DVD was sent faster than I expected. Great service from this distributor. An excellent movie too, by the way, if you've never seen State of Grace with Sean Penn and Gary Oldman."
5,Incredible...,This is one of the best movies that I have ever seen. Not to give the final scene away but I have never seen an ending done so well before. Unfortunately my copy was lent to someone who did not give it back... This is why I am here... A plea to Orion to Re-Release the movie so that everyone can enjoy it.
4,A Missing Gem,"This film is an awesome reflection of the struggle to identify right and wrong. When among friends, the definition of right and wrong becomes very gray. In many ways, Penn's character is wrong in the betrayal of his friends. This film has a few twists, but generally, the plot is straightforward. If people like the humanity of the Sopranos, I think they will like this film. I think the reason this film did poorly in the theaters was due to the struggle that Penn was having with Madonna (the failed marriage) and the press at the time of its release. Penn could be a real jerk but so can the press. I still watch this film over and over again and it never gets boring. With all of the stars in this film, I am surprised it has not seen some kind of renaissance."
5,Exactly what I expected,My kitchen is decorated in logos & labels. This was a perfect addition. It is much sturdier than similar signs.
5,Great item,This is a good guide and very easy to use. It is my very first try at carb counting and this is really helpful.
5,Great book,"This book is an excellent guide for diabetics or people who are insulin resistant, like myself. Easily understood, excellent information. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested about foods and how they affect you."
3,It's a towel rack; clean and simple,"This towel rack has a clean and simple design. It is large enough for one big bath towel or several hand towels. The brackets that go over the door are deep so it will fit over most doors, but this makes the rack a bit unstable if using it on a thin door. There are holes in the brackets where you can place screws to solve this problem, however the hardware is not included."
4,"Over the door, not shower door.",This is beautiful and sturdy but it is for over the bathroom door not for over a glass shower door. The hooks are too large for the glass shower door and when you hang a towel on it the rack falls. It works much better for over the back of the bathroom door.
4,This film has grown on me...,"The storyline involves a group of women factory workers with generous figures who have decided to celebrate their girth by becoming sumo wrestlers. They use the art and philosophy of wrestling as a support system. The main characters are not the Sumo women but a new member of the group, a rather mousy woman and her unemployed husband. He is sweet but terribly immature and alternates between being too predictable and just plain weird. I found myself hoping that her new found sumo-self would find someone more in her league or that her sumo sisters would teach him a few things. Neither happens though she become a much stronger women as her sisters give her permission to grow both inside and out."
1,problems with quality,"There is a defect on this product at the 23-24 min on the disc at the 30-29 score in the 1st half. Bought 2 discs and both have the same problem. Played it on 3 DVD players and all locked up and had to return it. GREAT GAME, but can't watch it. Bought it again after the product was discontinued and put back onto the market (assuming it was fixed) and still has the same problem (1-3-09)."
1,APC failes the quality test,I experienced the same problem with my APC XS-1000 as noted by several others here.It worked great then the red OVERLOAD light and alarm went off and it is now completely useless. This is an expensive piece of equipment with a single purpose and it failed to perform past 11 months. I have other Battery Backup UPS's from other makers and they are all over 3 years old and not a single one has failed.This is obviously a faulty part installed at the factory and it seems they are still pumping them out. I guess they will finally correct the problem when their customer base falls off the page. This will definitely be the last APC product I purchase and I will warn my customers about it as well.
2,Good luck finding replacement batteries,"It appears that APC has discontinued this model, or at the very least seems to have discontinued the battery. I've been searching for days for someone who has an RBC32 (battery required by this unit) - and no one seems able to obtain one in less than 90 days. The CDW operator told me they have hundreds of these things on back-order and that APC is unable to provide them - without at least a 90 day wait. In fairness I have to say that the unit worked reliably until this point - I just think you need to be very careful about using a unit that's popular enough that replacement batteries will still be available when yours wears out."
1,"Was fine, then completely unreliable","I've had this unit for a few years. On a recent brown out, I found this completely dropped power instantly, telling me the battery must be completely dead. Of course, there's a battery indicator that SHOULD have alerted me to this so I could change the battery. The bigger issue is now it randomly drops power. I thought it was a problem with my PCs, but this morning I noticed both PCs and the cable modem were all powered off simultaneously. All 3 devices are plugged into this unit. Needless to say, I'm extremely disappointed. I work in the IT field and my computers are rather expensive, which is why I chose to protect them on a UPS. Now the very behavior this is designed to prevent (sudden, unexpected shutdown of PCs) it is the cause of! I'm hesitant to buy another APC product."
1,Erratic performance after a month,"I have a total of four UPSes at home including the BX1000, which I purchased from CompUSA with a hope for high performance. The symptom of frequent switching beween ""on-line"" and ""on battery started"" after a month or so, when the replacement peirod at CompUSA had just expired. It beeps every few minutes while it is on. Sometimes, the power dies and my screen becomes blank. I have had good faith in APC's product, thus it is a disappointment."
1,APC BX 1000 A Piece of Junk,"I won't waste too much of my time or that of others going over the details of problems I have had with this unit. It's all been said better than I could by others in this review segment, including the intractable overload issue. The unit is overpriced, unreliable and by all indications, if one is to rely on APC, unfixable. My only regret is that Amazon's rating system seems to require that I give it one star. Trust me folks this item is not worth one star. So much for APC. I strongly advise that you not buy any of their products at any cost. Go elsewhere!"
1,Twice gone bad,"I bought a BX1000 brand new from Office Max about 4 years ago. It ran perfectly for 2 years then every once in a while would fail the PowerChute self-test stating bad battery. Re-run the test and it would pass. Thinking the battery might be going bad. One day I turn on the computer and nothing - dead in the water so to speak. Tore the unit apart looking for any signs of what failed and found nothing. The resetting fuse in the back had not ""popped"" either. Called APC, they said it was dead unit out of warranty. So I went to eBay bought another one used but working on March 11, 2006. Poof, turned on computer today and dead, overload light came on and steady tone. Tried everything to reset the box and nothing works only the steady overload tone and light with nothing plugged in to draw a load. Piece of crap!!!!"
1,Failed,"Two exact units failed, love the incessant beeping... wonderful. Not worth the time or money, find a unit that has good reviews and save the heartache."
1,"Overoad when on Battery Power, nothing connected.","Just want my vote counted, too. The same problem everyone else is having. Does APC build junk? This would work as a very expensive surge suppressor, but whenever in battery supply mode it shows overload with nothing connected."
1,Failed in 44 hours.,"I bought this item and turned it on with no load as I was going to reconfigure my power setup. After 44 hours the thing started chirping. No fault was shown on the display. Nothing in the instructions showed how to find the problem. After talking sometime to APC and changing sensitivity and other things they suggested, I plugged a lamp into it to create some load. When I unplugged the UPS from the wall everything died.Currently being returned. Will look for a different supplier."
1,Overload light with no load.,Same problem others have reported with overload light under no load. Out of warranty but this sounds like design flaw.
3,APC XS 1000 UPS,"I bought the APC XS 1000 UPS about 3 years ago. I live in Independence, Missouri where the power is fairly clean. However we get nasty thunder storms from time to time causing the UPS to go on battery a few times in 3 hours. I have had no problems with the unit until 9/2/11. I turned on my computer's power supply (550Watt) and the ups went into overload condition like described by others. I called the APC service and they said that if the unit goes into overload condition with no load then the unit is junk. Well Thank you. I won't buy anymore APC UPS anymore."
5,"This is a fun, fun book!","The photos are terrific and the little story behind the project, which is told in the end pages, made me laugh out loud. If only the book weren't so expensive. But if you can afford it, and you have a fondness for seeing jumpsuited Elvis look-a-likes in very un-Elvis situations, you will treasure this book."
5,A Wonderful Read,"The author knows his stuff. Very interesting and even funny in places. Finally, a focused work that has data, not speculation."
3,Not for those who are looking for solid mathmatics!,"The book is written for those who don't like math equations. To me, an equation is most straight forward to explain statistic theories. The authors did great job to avoid equations. It is a good book for those who don't want to know the equations. The overall almost perfect rating (5 stars) misled me in the first place. I will return it."
4,Reading and Understanding Multivariate Statistics by Grimm,A good resource for someone taking a psyc stat class.
5,Randy Travis,Good easy listening. Anyone who loves country music will enjoy these songs. Randy Travis is one of the best in country music
5,Devon,"This is by far the freshest take on Folk/Rock I have heard in a while. When I checked out devonmusic.com and found out the this girl is only 17, I was hooked! The scary thing is that her talent is just starting to take off. Hysterically, is my pic for the teen anthem of the new millenium."
3,a second chance to catch a soft cell show!,"i was one of the lucky few to see soft cell on their little so called u.s. tour. they originally scheduled 11 shows, but only played 5 shows due to bad ticket sales, management, fill in the blank, etc... in any case their los angels show was great. the perfomance on this dvd is good although not as good as the show i saw in los angeles. this dvd also contains a 20 minute interview with marc and dave discussing soft cell beginings. the audio sounds fine, although i'm sure someone will find something to complain about. there are very good close-ups on marc and dave(and some good close synth shots as well). i'd rate this dvd 3 1/2 stars. i'm glad i bought this dvd and have it in my collection."
4,NCLEX RN Review made Incredibly Easy,"Excellent book to review prior to professor's lectures-gives the nursing student the quick and skinny about the topics w/ great little mnemonics, highlights most prevalent information, plus quickie illustrations-.....not an in depth book-but it is a great review."
4,NCLEX easy?,"I found this book covered all systems. Although, at times I had to second guess their rationale for the answer. It was useful in reviewing and hopefully passing the NCLEX in June 2004."
5,Awesome!,This is a great book. Gives you a thorough review of the systems and provides questions at the end. It literally is Incredibly Easy! Recommended to my class!
4,Very good Quality!!,I am very pleased with this item! It shipped quickly and is in very good condition!Thanks so much
2,NCLEX-RN,The NCLEX RN book was sent via plastic bag instead of box so I guess that is why it was all bent up but it wasn't in a brand new condition but it was good. The thing that got me about the book is that it has an online sight to go to but the questions were not as good. The format seems very basic and I thought it was going to be great since I bought the fluids & Electrolytes book which was good but they need to have NCLEX questions that pertain to those small subjects which are very important. I have other NCLEX books and I recommend the NCLEX 4000 or if your want to spend some real hard earned money try learningext.com which is very expensive so buy it if you can afford it!
3,Its ok. I have not really used it yet...Looks helpful though,"It looks like a good book....There is a ton of information on one page though, making it hard to focus"
5,NCLEX-RN Review Made Incredibly Easy,A fabulous aid for any graduate studying for N-Clex. Broken down into easy to assimilate sections. Very helpful! I highly recommend this book.
1,Software Problems,"The software included with this text has issues. In order to restart this program I have to uninstall/reinstall direct X and this program. Otherwise it simply fails to launch. I double click the icon and get the hourglass, then nothing. Although this is a known issue, their tech support has no fix. I cannot save my place during testing. This a major PITA since testing on a certain number of questions at a time is required by my university."
1,Natural Gain Plus (One Bottle),"Definetely it didn't work for me, i'm completely disapointed with this product. I don't suggest it to anyone.Sorry but i'm just being truly.They said if it doens't work, i could claim, but i think, it was just a joke, because, from begining, they know that it doesn't work.RegardsNelson Uetimane"
2,Quite generic information,Perhaps just because there is little to do and things change quite frequently and abruptly. I bought the book as I was not able to connect my AppleTv to the mac and I got useful hints to solve the issue. Anyway a visit to a Mac store has been so far the quicker solution. So my suggestion is to buy this book only if you have no nearby Mac Store and you have a very quite naive knowledge of networks.
1,Not as good as enclosed directions,"I got this book to troubleshoot an already set up wireless system. When I encountered problems, the book did not provide insight beyond that provided by the instructuons. If you enjoy lame humor and need to fill your empty bookshelf, buy this book."
3,Too MUCH Info,"As something that is suppose to be for dummies it is far to techie and has way more info than what I was looking for, not the simplest of what i was looking for - diagrams of wiring and routing, and all the address info they always ask for, but is never easy to find."
2,Product rating,This product came late and was in awful shape with bent pages and a falling apart cover. I was disappointed.
3,i HEAR the music,"It's almost disgusting how many times race came up in these reviews. People have seen the blue eyed blonde and closed their minds to what she is. Bottom line is Joss Stone has a tremendous voice, regardless of range, she uses what she's got and it works. For those that can't appreciate it attempt to open your mind slightly and see that this seventeen year old girl, who is in fact human, is coming into her own just as all of us did at that age found herself centered enough to give us her music. Appreciate that if nothing else, few have the focus or we would all be pop stars. I think this album reflected a slight vocal immaturity but all in all Joss Stone DEFINETELY has a future. Not to say that she is the future of all that soul encompasses but I think that if people would take the time to really HEAR the music and not see the color of her skin they would be able to realize Joss for what she is, a talented young artist. (a BLACK woman)"
3,A poor woman's Toby Lightman.,"She's young -- and she does have a great voice. But this album anyway isn't quite there. The lyrics are so-so, and the production quality is good, but not great. I'd give it 3.5 stars."
5,This CD Rocks!!!,"If you enjoyed the debut CD of Ms. Joss Stone, entitled 'Soul Session' you will love this CD - 'Mind, Body, & Soul'. Ms. Stone's message is mature. Her voice is strong, crisp, clear, and is pack with power. Joss will take on an emotional journey. JOSS STONE ROCKS!!!"
5,Fabulous,"I had bought her first cd of covers, ""Soul Sessions"" in June, and I have been waiting for this cd to come out. It is wonderful. Joss Stone has an amazing, but different voice that is intriguing. I cant find one track on this cd that I don't like. The soul she exudes is very vivid and clear on this cd. Definately recommend this cd to anyone who might be the least bit interested."
5,The BEST!,"I purchased Mind,Body and Soul,on the advice of one of the greatest vocalists in music history...Robert Plant.Robert stated in an interview that Joss is the only artist out there today thats worth her weight in salt.So I bought the cd.I was blown away.Her vocal range,her power and shear presence to me is awsome.Joss's voice is so powerful and crisp unlike anything I have heard since Aretha Franklin.This cd is an absolute must have...PERIOD!Favorite song,gotta be ""torn and tattered""As for the not being able to play it on your computer,hmmm i listen to it all the time on my laptop."
1,What the heck is this?,Can anybody honestly say they like her singing or her voice? Stop dragging out the song with irritating and annoying rambling!!! Listening to her music stresses me out.
1,Her voice makes me cringe!!!!!! Makes me sick!!!!,"I have tried to listen to Joss Stone. There is all of this hype surrounding her. But everytime I hear her voice it makes me sick. I am a fan of r& b soul music and Joss Stone's voice does not qualify as soulful. Singing from the soul is natural and unforced. But everything about Joss Stone's voice is forced. I've heard many a soul singers before and none of them have to force their adlibs. It is just natural. But alot of people who are amazed by Joss Stone are probably not used to listening to real soul music so they would not know the difference. By the way, Joss does not have much of a vocal range. All she does is have a deep voice with some forced adlibs that are painful to stomach coming from a fan of real r & b soul music."
2,NOT ORIGINAL....Just listen to Taylor Dayne,"Give me a break. Joss isn't orginal. I am sick of the media giving credit to a 17 year old with what they consider soulful voice and hyping her up. WAKE UP AMERICA--Don't fall for this it's called marketing. If I am not mistaken their was a white girl back in the day that sang real soul and her name was Taylor Dane. She can sing and hold notes. Listen to Taylor's ""I'll Always Love You"", ""Love Will Lead You"",or ""Heart of Stone"". Taylor was also know for her ""deep"" voice that could hold notes. This is who Joss Stone sounds as if she is mimicking. Hey can't blame a girl for trying her best and selling albums to people who can't see true talent.I am only giving her this CD two stars for the beatsm rhythms, and out of respect for the producers because it is definitely not for Joss's singing ability."
1,Just Another...,"...in a long line of false notes. Stone's ""pretend soul"" reminds me of that equally false - and insipid - Alan Parker movie, ""The Commitments.""NO kidding: I have A&R; friends who can play me any number of demos that sound like her, and some better. She's a polished karaoke singer with a penchant for r&b.; Whoopee."
1,Stick with Beyonce. She's better!,"Chile, I just hate this record. I can't believe all the reviews I've been reading about this frumpy white girl. First of all, she's obviously nowhere near as good as Beyonce, the ORIGINAL diva! And Ashlee Simpson can blow her right out of the water. Miss Stone can't sing and she can't dance, so why bother? Just wait til Grammy night next year, and I predict that this heffa won't even get nominated. Just watch."
5,"Finally, a young female singer who can sing!!!!","Joss Stone is definitely a singer with a beautiful voice. The first time I heard her song, Fell In Love With a Boy, I fell in love with her voice. She has an incredible voice, and you can hear it on this album. My favorite tracks on this album would definitely have to be Spoiled, Jet Lag, and Sleep Like a Child. She is one singer who can definitely hold her own."
4,Some of you should be ashamed...,"I had no intention of writing a review for this album...until I read some of the comments. As a black man, I just want to apologize for the ignorance shown by some of my brothers and sisters...that does not represent the whole when it comes to this artist. Let that be known.Joss is an incredible talent - black or white - and to a certain level, her career really reminds me of the buzz that surrounded Eminem and Anastacia early on concerning the color of their skin and then their music style. Well, she has been taught by some of the best in soul music and I think this album shows growth from her first, in terms of using her vocals...some of the writing needs work, but she will get there.Most importantly, she is helping to spread to soul music worldwide, you can't hate on that. At 17, it is unbelievable to me that anyone could not be impressed."
3,Pleasant but not something I'd write home about,"She's got a great voice but perhaps this is just a little too laid back. Pleasant as background music if you're having a dinner party, though."
4,Joss Stone is simply amazing,"I loved Joss's first cd, ""The Soul Sessions,"" and I just couldnt wait to hear some of her own material. I had been waiting for ever for this cd to come out, and i picked it up the day it came out. Joss has taken on a different sound for ""Mind, Body and Soul"", and it sound more like ""Super Duper Love"" and ""Fell in Love With a Boy"", from her first cd. Her voice is incredible. It can hit every high and low note imaginable, and for a 17 year old like myself, her lyrics are quite impressive, and mature. My favorite songs are probably (so far) ""Dont Cha Wanna Ride"" and ""Snakes and Ladders"". If there one cd you should definately buy this year, make it this, and Alanis Morissette's ""So Called Chaos""."
5,Spellbinding!!,"Joss Stone has proved her gift once again with this stunning follow up to ""The Soul Sessions."" A lot of people give her a lot of mess because she's white singing ""soulful"" music, paticularly the black community because they feel they're being robbed of their music. Well everybody needs to sit on down and stop acting like a brand new pair of pumas because Music is music and if they have the talent why should it matter if they're black, white or any other color for that matter. Joss, just keep doing ur thang and don't worry about those haters!"
2,HYPE,"To mention Joss Stone in the same breath as any number of female soul singers or even Teena Marie or Lisa Stansfield is a joke and an insult. This girl is no more soulful than any singer on American Idol. She does have a gimmick that can sell though cause she sounds black, is 17, and singing something other than teen pop.That said her voice isn't embarrasing but it isn't great either and her songwriting is mediocre. She does get points for using real musicians and bonafide background singers but other than that she's no better vocalist than say, Kelly Clarkson on a good day.Hype for its own sake."
4,Something missing....,"Joss Stone has an amazing voice and talent.The Soul Sessions was her ""debut"" and now she realeased her second album,but her first album of her own material.What's missing is more fast songs than slow songs.Here's how I rate each track:1.Right To Be Wrong-4/52.Jet Lag-5/5-My second favorite track.3.You Had Me-10/5-My favorite track on the album.4.Spoiled-3/55.Don't Cha Wanna Ride?-5/56.Less Is More-4.5/57.Security-2/5-Worst track on the album.8.Young At Heart-2.5/59.Snakes And Ladders-4.5/510.Understand-4/511.Don't Know How-3.5/512.Torn And Tattered-3/513.Killing time-2.5/514.Sleep Like A Child-3/5Overall,not the best album,but if you like Pop and Rock,then this C.D. is for you!If you also like pop and rock,go get Ashlee Simpson's Autobiography.Bye!!"
2,This Chick is really over rated,I really do not like it. Worst then Norah Kones who has a better voice. Joss sounds like Anastasia eating a whale.She really has no voice all the songs sound the same they are all this boring 70's soul stuff. I really do not like this stuff she is not a real talent it is just B.S. because everyone sais Ashanti sucks which she does. Not for my ears
1,A total rip-off,"I don't care how pretty she is, Joss Stone rips off ""Am I The Same Girl"" by Hugh Masakela and calls it ""art"". Is there no end to this casual theft of classic songs by a bereft and talentless breed of hip-hop idiots? Jeez, give me a break!!"
1,Give it up already!!!!!!!,"How much longer do we have to continue having Joss Stone being shoved down our throats? I saw her Gap commercial the other day and I must say that it was unbearable to listen to. She is known as a soul singer, but where is the soul? She was trying so hard to sound soulful, but it just wasn't happening. I wish that the corporate big heads who are marketing this lady would realize that the people as a whole are not quite feeling Joss Stone. All of this great media and marketing push and she still has not gone platinum. If she were a black artist, first of all a black artist would not have all of this corporate backing. But hypothetically, if a black artist had all of this type of corporate support,failed to bring in the goods, the sells after two albums, they would have been dropped along time ago. But no!!! Ms. Stone continues to be supported because she's white, attractive and the white coporate powers want Joss to be the next Queen of Soul. This is so sad."
1,Oh Please BORING,"I still don't get all the hype and all the 4-5 star ratings she received. She needs to learn a lot about harmony, She sings in short breaths, one tone too, very very annoying. In fact the CD is boring as hell, nothing I mean nothing stands out. Yall must be industry insiders writing all these pitiful reviews. I don't pretend to get her singing at all. This is has no SOUL at all, somebody decided to lable her SOUL LOL. It's all HYPE!!!"
3,Her Voice....,"Is amazing...I saw her on one of the late night shows where she was performing 'SPOILED'...so I went and got it the next day.It's was okay...(I gave a 3 because of her voice)...but she is in DESPERATE (and look--when I say desperate, I mean 'hanging off a cliff' desperate) need of a lyrical genius.Her songs have no layers or texture to them as the writtings are very elementary and extremely predictable (OH MY GOD!!!!! are they predictable) in my opinion.She needs to enlist the help of 'Lady T' (Teena for you oblivious ones) or her writers and then she'll be cooking with gas or electric...which ever you prefer.Even with saying that...she is young, she has excellent potential and she sings tha' musik I like which is a rarity with new artist (most of which suck) now days.There4--I look forward to receiving her next session..."
2,"I don't hate Ms. Stone, I strongly dislike her...","First let me say that I wish Joss Stone the best of luck with her career. I have nothing against white soul singers or pop music, so I dont base my reaction to her material on these factors. I base it on what I see and what I hear. What I hear is a over-produced young lady with a voice that makes me want to punch a wall. What I see is video production and press stinking of ""love me/flower-power"" corn. I'm sorry, and I may be overreacting, but if I hear her sing ""Don't Cha Wanna Ride"" one more time I may attempt to kill her. Okay that's a bit much but no Joss, I dont WANNA ride. That being said, everyone has a niche, and everyone has different tastes, I just can't see it.. at all...Before I end this I'd like to send a shout out to ?uestlove for attributing to her musical soundscape. Must say that really hit me in a funny way, still can't figure that one out. But I must remember the golden rule: music is a business.........."
4,Beautiful Soul,"This is an excellent cd. I have loved Joss, from day one. Her first cd was good too. This one was better in my opinion. Her vocals were amazing and she uses excellent beats to help create a good soulful vibe. She is a very talented and unique artist and will be around for a while. I love it!"
4,SHE'S GOT IT!,"I'm really feeling this album. I was very hesitant to buy it at first but I'm glad I did. Joss Stone proves she can hang with the R&B crew and produce good music. She's not just another ""blue eye soul"" wannabee. Overall, this is a good album and if you're into good soul music, this is it. You will not regret your purchase."
1,Whats all the fuss about?,"After giving listening to this CD a few times, I cannot see what all the fuss is about. She is mediocre at best. There may be some ""Mind"" and some ""Body"", but there is no ""Soul"". I hate sound negative, but i can think of at least 9 or 10 Soul/Neosoul singers better than Joss Stone. The quick rundown in no particular order: Amel Larrieux,India Arie, Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, Goapele, Jaguar Wright, Me'Shell NdegeOcello, Teedra Moses, Tweet, etc,etc...Now her being white has nothing to do with this review,(i.e. Diana Krall is awesome) She just sounds manufactured. Like the New Kids on the Block, Spice Girls, etc. Soul music should not be painful to listen to, but Joss kills by moods, and tenses more than it relaxes. If you want some REAL soul music check out one of the aforementioned artist, if Jazz is your thing Diana Krall is the one for you. Also, that GAP commercial is terrible!!!"
1,So annoying...,"I heard Joss Stone on the Today show a couple of weeks ago and she sounded pretty good, singing You Had Me. She was so adorable and unpretentious, I figured I had to give her a try. I should have just downloaded You Had Me and saved myself the money. This CD is so boring...and so monotonously annoying, I never even made it to the hidden bonus track."
2,"Great voice, wrong music","I bought this cd because I heard Joss sing on TV and was greatly impressed with her voice. I am still amazed that someone so young has such a wonderful voice. But, I felt the music was not quite right for her. It was like Etta James music on steroids."
1,Right To Be Wrong!,"Yes! But listen to me you all Stone lovers. This one lacks very much to be a musical masterpiece. Indeed, Joss has nothing new to say for us. Old cliches are dancing like zombies in the middnight!"
5,The REAL debut...,"I am already a fan of Joss...I bought her first CD right when it came out in Canada. But, like many, I was curious to hear what her first CD of ORIGINAL material would sound like. It doesn't disappoint. Some of the material is a bit harder hitting (see ""You Had Me""), but her fabulous vocals just keep on coming...Highlights for me would definitely be ""Jet Lag"" and ""Spoiled"". If you liked ""The Soul Sessions"" you'll definitely enjoy this disc, but you won't know any of the songs beforehand :)"
5,Wonderfully enjoyable!,"My family and I had no clue about Joss Stone 'til she started appearing everywhere! We purchased this album and it really was wonderfully enjoyable! My mom and I like every single song on it. My personel favorite song is ""Don't Cha Wanna Ride."" All of her songs have beautiful lyrics, some have catchy tunes like ""You Had Me"", yet some are beautiful like ""Sleep Like A Child."" Anybody who purchases this album should enjoy it!"
5,The best album of 2004,"I would like to say a long, long text about her, but it's impossible to me, because i think that it's really impossible describe the experience of hearing Joss Stone. Her voice is just incredible, and she sings like nobody else in the world. This CD is just unbelieveble."
5,My Favorite,"I have all of the Joss Stone CD's and this is my favorite, although I haven't been disappointed by the others!"
3,Good Try,"I really like this album. I don't love it but there are many good songs and I love Joss's style and voice. She is alot like Janis (no last name needed). This album start's off strong. Tracks 1-6 are the best songs on the album, everything after that is hit or miss. She had fullers mixed in with good songs and after awhile they all start sounding alike.Songs she Should Have Left Off1. Don't Know How2. Torn and Tattered3. Killing Time4. Sleep Like A Child5. The Hidden TrackAll 5 of these songs are weak and forgettable and drag the album out alot longer than it needed to be. Yet, the first 6 songs are great. I love ''Right To Be Wrong'', ''You Had Me'', and ''Spoiled''. If you've every had doubts about yourself, been in a bad relationship, or want to get back with an ex your still in love with, then those songs are for you. Overall this is a B- album. Not bad but not great either."
4,very soulful,"this album is very good. if you liked 'soul sessions', you'll probably like this one. it has many great songs including 'understand' and 'torn and tattered'. i like almost every song on this album. 'Don't cha wanna ride' is funky and upbeat. Buy this cd!"
3,The sequel isnt always as good as the original,"First, I want to say I love Joss Stone's voice and music! Although her first CD was awesomely out of this world, the second, ""Mind, Body, and Soul"" left me hungering and waiting for more. As each new tune played, I waited and waited for the Joss Stone that I had heard on the first ""Soul Sessions"".........it never came. Her voice was wonderful, as usual, it was just the music chosen. Im almost sad I bought it, but I will continue to follow her music and can't wait for her third try. Everyone makes a CD that is not up to par during their career. Bring on more, Joss!!"
4,"Mind, Body & Soul","It's the voice ! Soulful, but fresh . I purchased this again to replace a missing one . I expect Joss will get better with experience . Anticipating the 5 star rating ."
4,"awsome , sexy.soultry.",I jusat love this Album. First time i have enjoy a good soul music in a very long time.
5,one of the best cds i own,"I bought this cd back in 2005 after i was listing to yahoo radio and the song ""you had me"" by Joss Stone came on and I fell in love it. Couple of days afterwards I purchased it, and it turned to be one of my favorite cd, and I bought it becasiue od one song. I love the beats in all of her songs and her amazing voice.This cd will make you happy and energized but yet calm no matter what mood you are in."
4,good 'first' album,"This is Joss Stones first true album - most songs being written or co-written by her. And, to be honest, it is not as good as i was expecting. The songs aren't bad, but they really dont show off her voice. Songs such as 'Snakes and Ladders' and the hidden track no.15 are great - but her talent is hidden.Overall, as a first album it is good, but with all the people behind her, I thought she could have got something better. Though, I still recomend this to anyone who like Joss Stone and hope for a more powerful next."
2,"Not bad, but not there yet","Yes, Joss Stone has a warm, deep voice that is very reminiscent of a some of the older blues singers. The problem I have with that voice is though that it does have a tendency to get on my nerves after a while. Her timbre is always the same, no matter if she is supposed to sound happy, sad, angry or mellow. Sure, she is young and might grow into a really great singer with more experience and maturity. She is not quite there as of yet, though. The same holds strue for her songwriting, which at the moment leads to pretty mediocre fare. Hopefully her record company will give her the chance to blossom. In the meantime I will stick to my old soul records."
2,"MIND, BODY & SOUL","JOSS STONE IS A GREAT SINGER, BUT THIS CD EVERY SONG SOUNDS THE SAME. WOULD NOT BUY THIS CD AGAIN."
1,Disappointing,"This is a great CD; in fact, I love it. But I'm giving it one star for one reason only -- it's ""copy protected"". You can't play this CD on your computer, you can't make a backup copy for your car, and you can't transfer it to your mp3 player or iPod. I realize millions of people out there are stealing music, but this isn't the answer. It's not 1990 anymore. In order to listen to this CD the same way I listen to all my other CDs (every single one purchased by me, BTW) I'd have to pay for it THREE TIMES over -- once for the house, once for the car, and once (downloaded from a legal site) for my mp3 player. No thanks."
2,"Decent, but ...",The music on this album would not be half bad if somebody else were singing.Joss Stone has one of the most hideous voices I have ever heard. Music studios really do need to quit admitting just anybody.
2,kinda Overrated&Just aight,"while Joss stone has Talent,she is way overblown. I don't hear no second coming of anything. she ain't dropped a Rick Asterly cut if you must go there.seems like a ""American idol"" type of Act. to much pushed without anything really knocking me out."
3,First CD so much better,"The Lady can sing,but this cd sounds like everything that is out by beautifully voiced women today, nothing musically original."
3,"Good movie, but film quality somewhat poor","This movie by far keeps the essence of the classic Russian masterpiece. The English versions were awful, and I was very delighted to have the pleasure of viewing this Russian production. The quality of the film is lacking, but nothing terrible. This movie sticks closely to the story except for the absence of ""Levin's story"". His relationship with Kitty is there, but briefly. No detailed perspective on the importance of his charcter, and no mention of his brother. Also, there was no revelation for Kitty's transformed outlook on life after her sickness and before marrying Levin.The main storyline with Anna, husband Karenin, and Vronsky was well done. I enjoyed it.Overall, it was good. I'm glad to have it on my shelf in my colection of Russian movies."
3,Needs more work,"If the flickering of the film doesn't give you a headache, then maybe the fact that the English Audio track has roughly 15 - 20 minutes of russian with subtitles that just come and go. The color is all washed out, though the picture is sharp??? Why did they only go halfway with this? Then there's the two disk thing, this film is only 2hrs 20mins long, it would easily have fit on one disk.The film itself is okay, a bit short for such a long novel (why can't they just give this a 3hr treatment?) There is still alot missing from this adaptation though it is the most exhaustive I've ever seen."
3,Is this Anna?,I was so excited to see a Russian version of Anna Karenina. The Russians in general have such a flare for romantic drama. This version is a let down. I enjoyed some scenes but in general the camera shot in wide shots of the rooms they were not close ups so that we could feel what the characters are going through. There is a scene that artfully expresses desire. I will continue to search for the perfect screen adaptation of this tragic tale. Has anyone got some suggestions?
2,OK but not great,Interesting book. I suppose I was expecting more instructions where love making was concerned and less information about ancient ritualistic living in general.
2,Meh,"There's got to be better out there - and if not, perhaps I should write it. Yes, this gives you some basic set of instruction but it still sprinkled with judgements and limitation - we need a book on connectivity"
5,Great product!!,"This product is great!! Very affordable, very easy to use and it looks great!!! For those of you wanting to black out some trim on your vehicle but can't decide whether you should sand and paint or try the tape...TRY THE TAPE!!! it is really easy to apply, stays on well with little effort and it looks killer, I was astonished at how close to stock this makes the trim look. Great product, I would definately buy again!!"
3,Mediocre Item,"While the item does the job on flat surfaces, you do not want to force this on trim that has any kind of corner since it simply won't conform. I spent a decent hour dedicated to applying this on right, but it wouldn't budge. It looked nice until it had to conform to the corner in the trim.I ended up ripping it off and just painting my trim black. I'll keep the roll for any friends that might want it. I guess it is worth keeping in the garage just in case.At least it was only a few bucks."
2,Not that great,"Tried applying this to a 2011 CTS-V and the results were not that great. Yes, it can do smooth flat surfaces easily, but throw in a corner or unusual bend and it doesn't look right. The product also rips easily when removing it from the backing and has very rough edges. There really isn't a cheap way of blacking out trim. I will be trying a plastic dip method next as that will evening and fully cover the trim."
2,Outdated,"This might have been alright when it came out, but I really don't think kids today would be able to relate to it."
4,PLS-PM,"A model with continuous, dummy and nominal variable was ran (the same model that could be seen in the cover).It was new for me the way that the nominal variable was modeled to be part of a structural model: Social Status had 6 categories, one of them was used as category of reference, and for the others categories five dummies variables were created, which were used as formative indicators of Social Status. The results and the interpretation were presented in details."
1,Makes your reeds MOLD,"Disgusting. That is all I have to say after using this stuff. The reed vitalizer humidity pack goes into a rico reed vitalizer, but what they don't tell you is that if you use it your reeds will smell bad and even develop mold spots. HUGE waste of money."
5,These shoes are so chic !,"I was looking for a wedge slide for the summer months, and these shoes are absoulutly beautiful! They're lightweight and comfortable, and I love the bronzeish-gold color. I live in a small city, and none of the stores carry brands such as Kenneth Cole Reaction. The price is a little high, but they're beautiful and think they're worth it."
4,Timeless cd by Sarah Brightman,The ordering process went smoothly and I received the product in a timely manner. The cd plays fine but I was disappointed that the cd case was broken upon arrival.
3,"If you love Con te Partiro, then buy the ROMANZA CD instead","I read all the reviews on this album, with it's glowing 5 stars and thought that it would be as great an experince as hearing Sarah sing on ROMANZA with Bocelli. I was so disappointed with this album. I have loved her voice ever since Phantom was first released, and I have to agree with others that she has lost her angelic edge.I realise that Phantom is 10 years old, but this album doesn't do her justice. So if you love her duet with Andrea Bocelli in Time to say goodbye, get his album instead, leave Timeless in it's capsule. She has better albums out there."
1,"imitation of ""time to say goodby"" album","The album is essentially identical to Sara's album ""time to say goodby"". Do not buy this album unless you like paying double the price of ""time to say goodby"". I was amazed that the only change to the front cover, was the title."
5,This album made me buy a Brightman video.,I HAVE NEVER HEARD THE CLARITY IN A SONGSTRESSES VOICE THAT I HEARD ON THIS ALBUM. I HAVE HAD MANY FAVORITES BUT NONE REACHES THESE HEIGHTS FOR VOICE DIALOGUE WITH THE LISTENER.
3,It is a fairly difficult book to get through,"This book seems to be written for people who have extensive knowledge in other languages. Some parts are hard to digest, but the CD makes learning the pronounciations more palleteable."
1,Confusing,"I have studied many language textbooks, but this is just about the most confusing I have ever seen. Examples are given to translate without the grammatical concepts having been taught. He attempts to explain just about all verb forms in one chapter.Very limited glossary."
5,Totally Cool!,I recommand this doll because: it is fun. It teaches what they wear in Tokyo. It lasts forever and SOOO pretty! If you like different looking bratz then you should get this doll.
2,UGLY!!!!,"well, i don't own this toy, but i know one thing. it majorly stinks! her outfits are ugly and her hair color! no, the highlights are fine. but she has almost blond hair! buy the jade instead of sasha!"
4,brilliant,"The first time I really payed attention to Greg Johnson was the song now the sun is out from the movie 50 pills and after searching what seemed like forever to find an album from him I found Here comes the caviar and I fell in love with this album it's a little mellow but listen to the words and you won't regret buying this album, he has a very nice sound with a lot of piano but don't let that fool you."
5,great songs/timeless melodies,"I must have played this CD a huge number of times and the songs consistently suck you in and have you humming or singing along. Greg manages to write unpretentious, catchy songs that fit no particular genre and have a timeless quality. He isn't one of the better known kiwi song writers but is up there there with the best! Lovely production on this CD."
5,"Excelent product, more hours of operation for my camcorder","I have a SONY DCR-TRV730 camcorder and I have short time with the original battery FM50, around 1 hour of operation.This battery NPQM71D is it magnifies, I have gotten about 4 hours of operation.Now I am recharging the battery with the original adapter / charger of the camcorder; in the future I am considering to buy the quick charger for this battery, because it delays time in having full charge.All product SONY is very good; I recommend it"
2,Battery won't work,"I would rate it higher, but the battery was DOA. I called sony to get it replaced, but got a customer service rep that kept insisting that I could only use the supplied battery that came with my camcorder, eventhough this battery was made by sony for my camcorder?!? Anyways, after about 2 hours of being on hold, and arguing I got to talk to the supervsor, who proceeded to ask a series of dumb questions, but finally issued a repair order. I had to send the battery back to sony on my dime, two weeks ago, and the only response I've gotten is that they have recieved the battery. 3-4 hours of my life are now wasted on a $65 battery. I am not buying sony products for a long time to come..."
4,Sony NP-QM71D purchase,The product was very reasonably prices compared to other sites. It was received within a couple of days of order and it works fine.
2,Inspiration for mediocrity.,"I bought this book the same day I bought the beautifully-bound ""Trademarks designed by Chermayeff & Geismar"" (Princeton Architectural Press). I plan to use them both in a presentation to show what 40 years of good, solid design can do versus a Big Book of Hack. This is indeed a big book, but when David E. Carter refers to these logos as ""great"" he is really deceiving the growing designers in his audience. And when he goes so far as ""To paraphrase W.P. Kinsella, 'Publish it and they will buy.'"" his intentions become frighteningly transparent. If you truly want to be inspired, learn from the legends. For the same amount of money you can own the Chermayeff & Geismar book. I gave it two stars, but that's mostly for effort."
1,Gimme a break,"80% of this book is nothing but an uncritiqued (is that a word?) collection of logos created by desktop publishers. You have your standards; Hornall Anderson Design Works, Mires Design, GSD&M, etc, with their conceptually inspiring work but the quality falls off quickly thereafter. Mostly alot of clipart and rip-offs. This book is far from inspirational. Save your money."
2,Disappointing,"Pretty outdated, clip art looking images. Nothing exciting. Most of the logos look unprofessional and uninspiring. You cannot even guess what they represent. It is not worth the money."
4,"Baby loves them, but we've found something even better","I ordered these for my ~6 month old son. This was one of his first solid foods, and definitely the first that he could handle himself. He loves the cookies, but they make a real mess all over his face, clothes, and whatever he's sitting in. This was expected, and so we didn't mind so much, until we were introduced to 'Mum Mum' rice rusks. Those are a bit more expensive, but our son likes those even better than these, and they make zero mess, except for pieces he drops on the floor. Those are also available on amazon, just search for Mum Mum."
2,"Good cookies, but short shelf life","I was so excited to find the Arrowroot cookies on Amazon's website! So excited that I did not care if I needed to order 6 boxes at once. I expected that I would have plenty of time to eat them since I did order 6 boxes, but the cookies arrived (broken) with only two months left before they reached their shelf life (expiration date).I called Nabisco to see if I could buy them anywhere else in my area, but unfortunately there is not a high demand for them here (Chicago). They said I could order them directly from Nabisco, one box at a time, but they would cost $4-5 per box plus $10 delivery (ouch!) so I laughed and said ""No thanks!"".Too bad, the cookies are yummy, but not if you need to eat them EVERY day!"
2,Broken,"These cookies are great for a teething youngster, but it stunk that all 6 packs arrived with lots of broken cookies."
3,delicious but half broken when arrived,"delicious, but MANY are broken! you cannot give a baby a broken cookie. he/she could choke on a small piece. that said, everyone loves them (big kids too:)."
1,Disappointing book,"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I could not find one credible statement to support the allegation that New Agers have a secret plan to take over the world. Also, it is offensive to many religions, countries and peoples. Inflammatory and sad."
3,easy informative reading,"For those who are new to the new age and conspriacies VS the bible and it's phrophcies this book is a perfect starting point. This book is fast and simple reading (about an eighth grade reading level) which claerly defines all aspects of the new age cults and false religions. Those who are already well informed with the bible, and it's new age counter parts will fnd little new or of interst however. In fact although the book was only written 10 years ago some of the information seems dated. For instance most no longer belive the 'Mark' will be a tatto, rather more likly a computer chip will be placed under the skin. This is an excellent book, however, for those who are less well informed of the various symbols and methods used by the ""global Goverment"" new age ""new world order"" crowd to contol the masses."
5,For Your Listening Pleasure,Not just Funk but real musicianship. You have to listen several times to appreciate everything that is going on.
3,full of interesting characters,"Ammaniti's style is lean and sparce but full of references to many modern topics such as art,music and literature and it was fun to recognize the references or at least some of them. The book is chock full of interesting characters, some of whom appear only briefly and then disappear. The main protagonists, Pietro,a young student and Graziano, an aging Lothario meet only once but the effect of the encounter is life altering; Ammaniti tells a good story but his dialogue is stilted and the ending improbable and unsatisfactory. Being somewhat of an Italophile, I enjoyed the depiction of a small nondescript backwater town and the lives of the folks that live there. If these kinds of things interest you, read the book otherwise give it a pass."
5,The Tradition,"Lukashin has a tradition to go every New Year eve to sauna... and a lot of Russians have a tradition to watch this movie over, and over again. It is a classic. I am excited and scared at the same time to see the continuation of this story."
3,A CLASSIC.,"SAILING, ARTHUR'S THEME and ALL RIGHT are classic radio tunes. Christopher Cross wrote most of the material on this. The entire LP sounds very dated. None of the tunes on this are updated or remixed . Quality of the CD is not THAT fantastic. (W/ref to the West.Gemary pressing) A couple of the hits are missing, LAURA'S THEME, NEVER BE THE SAME... just to name but a few. No lyrics included on this release. Just about the BEST Christopher Cross greatest hits release available on the market right now. Will have to do I guess."
5,great songs,i've always dug the mellow tone and groove of Christopher Cross. this collection is the kind of music i can listen to on a Mellow day or weekend. Sailing is a tight laid back track. Ride like the Wind is the kind of track that is a feel good energy type of jam. Michael Mcdonald on the Hook sounds tight. Arhtur's theme is a nice song and I still dig that film. Say You'll be Mine is a good cut as well. Christopher Cross has a strong blend of mid tempo cuts that hold up very well after all of these years.
5,The Illustrated Guide to Extended Massive Orgasm,"This is a fantastic book. This book covers a wide range of topics thoroughly and sensitively. The illustrations are beautifully drawn. There aren't as many illustrations as I would have thought given the title; however, the descriptions are easy to understand and follow. I would recommed this book to anyone who wants to really get to know and understand their partner sexually and share mutually fulfilling sexual experiences. This is one of the most complete and informative books on sexual fulfillment that I have ever read by giving equal weight to female and male pleasure."
5,this really works,I bought this book because a friend recommended it but was very skeptical about the possibility of an estended massive orgasm. after doing the masturbation exercises my orgasm lasted for 25 minutes and i had leakage of semen and everything. this was the best orgasm of my life and it works every time out for however long i want it. then i tried it on my girlfriend and gave her the best orgasm of her life. this book really works and it only gets better with use and more fun with my lover than thought posssible. now i thanked my friend and recommend this book too.
5,changed my life,I always thought that I was a good attentive lover and after reading this book I realized that I was pretty good and had some new things to learn. After reading and studying the illustrated guide my techniques and communication abilities skyrocketed. My wife's orgasms keep on getting better and better and she is constantly asking me to go to bed. This book is for folks who are serious about their pleasure and are looking for even better ways to have fun. The drawings are well done and informative and the writing is clear with lots of information. Not for the timid or the sexist.
5,rolls royce of sex books,"the illustrated guide to extended massive orgasm is by far the best sex book that i have ever read. It is filled with useful information such as how to seduce your partner into bed, and what to do with them to give them the most explosive and fantastic time once you get there. I really loved this book, the illustrations are also terrific,to the point, and very professional and this book is a classic."
2,Illustrated Guide to Jerking Off,"I'm married, in my mid-20's and was looking for something to spruce things up in the bedroom. I ordered this book because of its positive reviews. However, not many of the reviewers seem to mention that this book's main focus is on manual stimulation. Call me what you will, but I'm not interested in this form of orgasm.And don't let the attractive young couple on the cover fool you - this book is chock-full of nauseating drawings of the AUTHORS (who are probably in their 50's) jerking each other off. Frankly, I don't know what to do with this book. I'm repulsed by every page of it."
2,Somewhat interesting...,"The book is informative, somewhat interesting, and has very descriptive and detailed techniques, but read more like an anatomy manual. It came off as clinical, and almost like the authors would like us to believe they spend 3 hrs a day stroking each other, with only the occasional release.I'm glad I read it, but was very disappointed. It does seemto have been a godsend for others, but just wasn't my cup of tea. Good luck."
5,priceless,I've taken all kinds of sex courses and read a number of books on sex and this is by far the best thing that i ever did. I could have saved a lot of money if this book was written ten years ago. It is the best by far.
1,Full of Fluff,"This is a great book to buy anyone first learning about sex, but if you are looking to further your relationship, this is not the book.The entire book could have been written in 10 pages, but the authors found a way to fill over 225 pages with fluff.If you are looking for something to expand your horizon, read Clint Arthur."
4,They're all back.,"A fun shoot 'em up. Like the previous iterations, it doesn't allow you the freedom to roam like in a true FPS -but the color, the models, the movement make you really wish you could slow things down a bit and get an eyeful of the beautiful CG elements these guys have created for this game. It's gory, disgusting and very cool like the others before it. There are some new monsters and level bosses and some updated returning zombies. If you liked the gameplay and structure of 1 and 2, you'll want to play this one as well."
2,could be cool,It appears you cant save this game when you want to . I'm tired of going back to beginning and starting over.
5,HOUSE OF THE DEAD 3,WELL AFTER GETTING 1 & 2 I JUST HAD TO GET 3 . GREAT FUN IF YOU LIKE SHOOTING GAMES THAT KEEP YOU GOING. HATE TO LOSE TO THEM. FAST ACTION AND ALOT OF SURPRISES. CAN'T WAIT FOR NUMBER 4
4,Very nice historical document.,"For the people who love the music of the U.S.civil war era, it's a very good recording. The arrangements are very well done and played. It is a good CD to have in a collection of that kind of music. For me it's a good deal."
4,cute toy,"The doll is very well made. Very durable, very cute, and small enough for the baby to grab in her little hands. I like it very much, but my daughter prefers stuff animals her own size. Since she's teething, she chews on it a lot, but she still prefers hugging something that's almost as large as she is."
3,Cheap in more ways than one,"The biggest problem I have with season 5 is that ALL 4 of the other seasons were done on single-sided discs with nice cover art, and on this one, they took the cheap road out with double-sided discs, which are more prone to disc errors. BOOOOO! They should have held the consistency throughout the series rather than just slipshod this one together the way they did. It's nice that the series is complete, but they really should have done a much better job putting this set together."
4,A good season!!!,I know it was a disgrace when Depp left the season and they putt him on the cover although he appears in one episode that was supposed to be in season 4 but still an ok season I mean I did not care for Michael deluise but Michael Bendetti was great. Peter DeLuise appears only in 7 episodes and Hoffs and Fuller are still there. As I said before an ok season.
3,21 Jump street season 5,Gift. See season 1 comments and review. Now I know why it got cancelled when everyone got too old..
3,Season 5 is not the best,The stories get darker. The ending is reveals that this show was taken off air without proper closure.
5,Best Heavy Duty Chain for the Price,"It's thick enough to be a deter thieves who want to cut through a lock, and in that respect, any large lock will do.This lock was the best value I could find on the net. I live in Hawaii and the total cost was around $55 - with free supersaver shipping.Pros: Price, durability, nylon sleave, no lock.Cons: what you'd expect - it's heavy.Why is having no lock a Pro? Because most locks are a joke. Buy this chain, then go to a locksmith and invest in a 6-pin key hockey-puck lock. Medico or Masterlock, then you know that whatever you lock up is pretty secure. Check out Youtube videos on how to pick locks - especially combinations locks - scary!Hope this review helps!"
4,Very Good Theoretical Overview,"A lot of clinicians who work with attachment and trauma issues fail to understand the theoretical basis behind their approaches. Without getting too bogged down in theory, this collection of chapters provides the reader with a good understanding of the psychology and biology of traumatic responses, as well as how to treat them.You've got top names in the field writing these chapters: Daniel Siegel, Mary Main, Allan Schore, Bessel van der Kolk, and Marion Solomon. It explores the research on attachment and trauma in-depth, so some readers might find this overwhelming. This is also a book for providers, not so much for parents.Christopher J. Alexander, Ph.D. [Author: 'Diagnosis, Assessment, and Treatment of Foster and Adopted Children; A Guide for Parents and Practitioners,' 2009]."
3,Healing Trauma: yes please,"This is a good book, but a little heady and heavy for someone who isn't in the business. It's worth buying if you are interested in somatic therapy or something outside of talk therapy. Very cutting edge and super interesting."
3,"BOLDLY And CLEARLY State CD-ROM Operating System Compatibility, PLEASE!","""Yes, Buster, there are Apple computers - Macs or Macintosh computers - in use on Earth."" I received this CD-ROM only to find that it is NOT Mac-compatible. I sincerely wish vendors would CLEARLY and BOLDLY state with which operating systems their products, such as this Taber's Electronic Medical Dictionary CD-ROM, are compatible. I try to find notation in product descriptions about operating system compatibility with products as these, but a great deal of the time the information is not definitive enough or totally missing! Stating compatibility would certainly save many Mac-users (and some Windows-based computer users) time and effort. I have to wonder if some companies offering such products keep their product information as ""out-of-date"" as they apparently keep their technological knowledge or as carelessly as they seemingly tend to consumer care."
5,On Time,"When I order books for my daughter going to college time is of the essence. I am always excited to find a book provider that gets the product to me on time. I write that down for future reference. I still have one more child to get through college. I need a lot more books.Sincerely, Jessie"
1,Bug Buster,"Wait--this was a toy? We thought it was to get bugs out of your house. As a toy, it's not very good; as a way to remove bugs, it's not very good, either. It's flimsy and not worth your money."
4,cheap alternative to dragging out the Hoover,"OK, I have to admit right off the bat that I am super-squeamish about creepy-crawlies. If there is a spider on the ceiling, I don't care how tired I am--I am NOT sleeping until that critter is gone. But it is a major drag to get out the vacuum, plus it terrifies the cats.A friend-of-a-friend recommended the Bugbuster, and I thought, What the heck. I've used it once so far--spider on the sofa! AAAAAAA!--and it worked fine. It was a BIG spider (eeeeek!), and with a fresh battery the suction was good enough to keep the critter from rushing out of the tube and....okay, I just can't go there. I managed to cap the tube and escort Mr. Spider to the great outdoors.I am a bit dubious about how well this will work for ceiling spiders--especially those that hunker down right where the wall and ceiling meet. We shall see. But for floor-crawling critters and those within easy reach, this contraption works fine."
1,"Bad design, no suction","Don't buy it. Waste of money. Even with new batteries it has no power to suck up anything, not even dead termites."
1,IF ANYTHING BLOWS AIR OUT!!!!!,"I will be fighting for a full refund from amazon! THE ITEM IS CLEARLY MADE IN CHINA there is no suction in the vacuum if anything IT BLOWS AIR OUT! When I received my item it was a lot smaller than expected it is probably 6 inches long YOU HAVE TO ASSEMBLE IT and when it is all done, you get nothing out of it! I am not exaggerating when I say I felt a small breeze rather than a suction. YOu hear a little motor somewhere, but it does nothing. DON NOT BUY THIS ITEM!"
1,Awful,Sorry but this is garbage. There isn't even a nice way to put it. It is just a piece of plastic that has no purpose. No suction at all.
2,Works ... but not well,It works OK but using one 9-volt battery means it has very little sucking power and you need to replace the battery often.
2,has hard time sucking even small roaches,"i wanted to use this vacuum to be able to suck clusters of roaches i sometimes find when moving stuff around without harming them. well, this vacuum thing have a hard time even sucking in individual baby roaches and it wont suck in bigger roaches. so its useless for me. i didnt try it on spiders or other insects though."
5,Humane bug removal,"A great way to escort unwanted bugs out of the house. The suction is mild and the opening is small for some bugs, but for 99% of those I encounter, this is the perfect way to return them to the great outdoors."
1,An Excellent Product Gone Bad,"I have owned a Bug Catcher for many years until we recently mysteriously lost it. The Concept and function is excellent in every way. The original (at $9.,95 )had a tube twice the length of the tube supplied with this one and all other mechanisms are identical--no improvements--just a change to yellow from cream. If I could find it locally I wouldn't have ordered it from this company. They first sent the wrong product--courteously told me to keep the error and they would send the BugBuster. They did but the power supply wire from battery to motor is broken in two places sufficiently to break the contact if the wire is bent. It will be simpler for me to repair it than to spend the money to return it. However, this company is making an outrageous profit and is not reliable in my view. Amazon should not be endorsing them. Ray B."
1,no sucking power,"I have the Bug Vac by Lentek, but it looks exactly like this model.I tried to suck up a small spider, and it didn't have enough sucking power. I scooped the spider into the end of the tube and the spider is able to hold onto the inside of the tube while it's on. I would return the item, but it's not worth my time or shipping money."
5,Delightful,"This is actually the second one of these we've purchased. The first one died after many years of good use, and my Mom had grown so accustomed to catching and releasing bugs that she demanded that we get another. (It was terrible. We had so many ""spider friends"" living in our house because we felt bad about killing them.) We love the bug vac for the stink bug infestation currently happening in our area of the country. It's not very strong, but too strong of a suction might kill more fragile insects. We've never had a problem with getting the bugs into the vacuum, and the cap makes it so convenient when you bring them outside.A reverse suction would be nice simply because some bugs cling to the plastic and are difficult to remove. A little shaking does the trick, but I'm always concerned I'll accidentally kill them at this point. Still, this contraption deserves 5 stars. Once you get used to it there is no going back."
1,Bug Buster is a BUST!!!!! Do not waste your $$$$,"Bug Buster is a BUST!!!!! Do not waste your $$$$... These things are worthless, they can barely pick up a piece of Hair.We would return them, but the return policy is restocking fee of 40%; which is truly ridiculous. They maybe good as a toy but are not effective at all for anything. The 9V battery that you have to provide and install yourself is worth more than this device. Again do not waste your $$$. Of course if you want one of ours, let's know :-)"
2,Mini Bug Vac,Not much suction.Battery compartment cap will not stay on and battery falls out. Had to tape closed.Disappointed.
3,Bug Buster!,It was a gift for my in laws they really wanted one. I noticed it doesn't suck that hard. It did work when they tried it on ladybugs. It's a very neat product.
1,Wow. Absolutely no use out of this product,"Waved the Bug Buster around at wasps, houseflies, tiny flying beetles, and they were barely pulled out of their path, let alone sucked into the tube. Placed directly above a tiny fly wandering aimlessly on the floor - nothing. Finally physically scooped up a fly, and with the suction running watched it crawl up the tube and fly away.Unfortunately, absolutely useless."
1,Does not work!,"First let me tell you...this thing is only about 1 foot long so you will still be very close to the bug. Second you can put this directly on top of a small mosquito and it will not suck it up the tube. Third if you manage to trap the bug you have to invert this while trying to keep the bug inside (the suction does not work at all) and then put on the lid with your hands, in the mean time the bug is running back out.Big waste of money...use your vacuum instead if you are afraid of the bug."
1,The quality couldn't be worse...,"I bought two of these, both broke within a matter of 2 weeks. The product worked fine while it worked, but you get what you pay for, and $10 does not buy quality."
1,What I thought of this product,"This is the worst product I have ever ordered. It says it sucks up bugs with a powerful suction. I couldn't even get it to suck up a piece of paper. I ordered two - and one of them didn't even work. And yes, it was a good battery. The one that DID manage to hum a little bit - didn't suck up anything not even a piece of lint. Save your money - don't buy this piece of crap. It would cost me more in postage to send this back than to just throw it out. SAVE YOUR MONEY - DON'T ORDER THIS. IT DOESN'T WORK."
1,pliers,"All I can say is pure garbage and amazon shouldent sell this item! Right after I recived these pliers I inspected them and I laughed,The pliers come in a tool roll inside it has a name branding that says Neiko tools USA and a sticker right next to it that says made in China! Let me tell you they are every bit made in China!You can see right through the edges I can only imagin if you tryed to cut wires it would take forever, I knew I shouldent have bought them but well im having a yard sale this spring thats where i'll be putting them."
4,"All but the slip-jaw ""channel-lock"" pliers are pretty nice.","These aren't top-quality tools, but you know that -- they wouldn't be this cheap if they were. All but the wide-jaw ""channel-lock"" style are up to whatever task I've thrown at them so far.The fake channel-locks, though -- the casting mold must be getting old, because the slots for the jaw adjustment are rough and poorly defined -- any pressure causes them to jump wider (often snapping all the way to the widest opening). Tightening the hinge bolt to the point that they wouldn't move freely didn't even help. I ended up throwing them away and buying a pair of real Channel-Locks.Even then, at this price, it's worth it for the other 5 pair."
3,What you would expect for the price,"For the price these tools meet my expectations. I bought these specifically so I could use them in crawlspaces/attics/outside and not have to worry so much about losing them. The lineman's pliers cut through some 12-3 without much difficulty. The diagonal pliers have a bit too much flex to do the job swiftly. The channel locks are complete rubbish out of the box, but they can be salvaged by honing the mating surfaces with a file. The process is a little tedious, but mine seem to function properly now."
3,good enough,Not American made but good price. Decent quality for mechanical work. Grip is alright. I actually got all six pieces. I guess it differs depending on who you ordered it from.
3,Good but not great,This is would be a great set if it weren't for the channels. They literally broke the first time I used them. The others seem ok.
2,"Mostly OK, channel locks are worthless","As the title states, this set has some decent quality tools for the price, but the channel lock pliers broke on the first usage. I tried using them to turn a simple valve and the top half just mashed down over the flimsy channels. These are the grooves in the pliers to allow you to adjust the width of the grab, but they are far too shallow for the amount of play in the handles. Unfortunately there is no way to try and fix them or tighten them up. I was able to turn the valve using another set of pliers rather easily so it was not that I was asking too much of that particular tool. Now I have a roll up tool set missing a pair of pliers, I would not recommend these if you intend to use the channel lock pair for anything."
2,Not High Quality,"I was expecting a bit better quality based on the reviews I read. However, once I received the package and inspected the pliers I decidedly immediately to return. The fit and finish of these pliers is not very good and the quality of the metal is questionable (made in China).Unfortunately, with the RMA restocking fee and shipping, you pay about half of the value just to return.I'd skip these and look elsewhere."
2,PLIER SET,VERY CHEAP MATERIAL. DO NOT RECOMEND IT NOT EVEN FOR LIGHT WORK AROUND THE HOUSE. INVEST IN A GOOD CRAFTMAN TOOLS.
1,Amateurish rerecordings,"I bought this because I enjoyed the ""Singing Machine"" series of Motown Karaoke discs a lot. For those who have not heard the Motown discs issued by the Singing Machine company, let me tell you that they feature the original performances (both music and vocals) remixed twice for each song, once with the instruments to the left channel and lead vocals isolated in the right and once with new stereo instrumental mixes. They are GREAT!This 2-disc set, however, features only rerecordings of these hits from the 80's -- the kind of stuff you usually hear in karaoke bars. It isn't that these renditions are terrible, they just aren't what I expected given the other releases in this company's catalog.If you don't mind singing karaoke to recreations of the original hits, then you might like this compilation. If you're looking for an interesting plunge into the original multitracks for these hits, you won't find it here."
2,Price is a little hight,"the fuel is great, but not the price, it war double of what it cost at the local store!! When I first order it online didn't know what the fuel gell is till I got it in the mail, when to the local store that sell lots of kitchen stuff from different country (World market), and the price was almost cut in half!!"
4,Good stuff,These things work really good. Great for steaks and pork and seem to be pretty accurate. Only used them once so I am curious to see how reusable they are.
4,Mustek Portable DVD Player - A solid purchase,"I purchased two Mustek Players - the MP70 - and this one. Both have been very dependable. These Mustek players play about everything I can stick into them. Of course, they play DVD video. They also play MP3 CDs and MP3 DVDs. And they play MPEG 4/DIVX Video files. This is extremely nice, because you can put an entire movie on CD, or several movies on DVD. I like the fact that they come with 117v power supply, a car power supply, and a battery pack that lasts through about 3-4 hours of play. Both players have been completely dependable."
3,"Good value for the money, good picture, cheap housing","Like another reviewer I bought this dvd player for half price ($49). Screen is clear and bright. My first run of the battery I was able to get 2.5 hours of playback with the volume at about half. Like many others have complained sound output is terrible. Unit is package with all the acc. you would need, av cables, dc cable, remote, and home charger. Plastic housing is very delicate, and cheap, it is only a matter of time before I destroy one or more of the latches. The hinge that connects lcd lid to the rest of unit is especially fragile with no release. It pops open only under pressure. Overall good buy for the money but I would not spend more than 60-70 for this, or buy a good comprehensive service plan or something."
2,Not worth for the money spent,I bought this item last month and i was very upset when i saw the image quality. I have another portable dvd player (Initial company) and ther picture quality is wonderful. I am also not happy with the apperance of the item.We have to user remote for all the functional activites which is again a drawback.
5,Pansonic SC-EN25 CD Micro System,The product was really good and I am enjoying hearing CDs on the system. It was well worth my money.
1,Skip this - Buy something else,"After playing it maybe 5 times, the screen went out and all you get now is sound. Not recommended."
4,wrong item,"Seller mail the wrong item for me, ut still not received respond from the seller, so no commended"
2,More talking heads than highlight footage,This was a real disappointment because I wanted a DVD to watch with my little leaguer to get him excited about the game and what could be done on the baseball field. He was bored as it was mostly talking heads with very little actual footage of great moments. Lots of behind the scenes and historical reminiscing about great moments....but only a moment or two of actual game footage.This DVD is not a highlight film...it's a talk show.
4,Ichiro Suzuki??,"The 30 moments are great, but how bout replacing Ichiro's rookie season with at least the 1997 World Series. that 97 Series was as exciting as the 91 and 01 Series. Ichiro's rookie season will only live up to Pacific Northwest fans and Asians."
4,Good buy for the money,Nice heavy chips in a good metal case at a very good price. Only stupid thing we found is that the two decks of cards that come with the chips are both black and white decks - they should be two different colors.
3,Not bad,1st case is not the same as pic2nd case is a 700 chip case not a 6503rd handle is cheapBut over all i do like it. Other then them 3 things.
3,Politics in the Raw,"This political satire holds your attention. What makes the reading a bit tedious is the fact that the styles of the various correspondents whose letters constitute the narrative, are not well differentiated, possibly due to translation. While the Mexican political chicanery depicted may seem extreme at times, our own Watergate, Monica L. and Weapons of Mass Destruction do not pale in comparison."
1,Disgrace,"Two beautifull films that, sadly, I must warn you away from. Razor Digital has set a new low point for DVD release. They've provided discs with such staggeringly bad picture, sound, and subtitling quality that I can scarcely imagine how it could be worse."
4,jericos road,Very good read.I ordered other books. And one of them I had ordered previously ' is there a way to let me know if I have already ordered . thanks
4,Practical guide to effective team managment at the work place,"Despite its clumsy name, Geil Browining's Emergenetics, offers practical and pragmatic advice on how to assess one's thinking and behavioral preferences on seven useful dimensions. Analytical, Structural, Conceptual and Social cover the thinking preferences and Expressiveness, Assertiveness and Flexibility cover the behavioral preferences. Emergenetics is the practice of developing thinking and behavior profiles on hundreds of thousands of individuals, analyzing these profiles for general understanding of individuals and groups and applying them to the improvement of personal and team effectiveness. Although the book doesn't discuss how profiles are generated, there is enough material to provide useful guidance to the reader in identifying and assessing these preferences in yourself and others."
1,Is this fake?,I have paid for this book for over 1 month. But I have not receive any responses about this order.Please dial 852-98512890 for Mr. Leung to tell me whyDon't cheat me!!!!!!!!!
4,Great little book.,"This is a great little book, especially if you live in the southwest where many of these plants are abundant. Even if you don't live in the southwest, there are plenty of recipes and techniques to get your wool, hemp or whatever dyed a great color for your purposes. As a dye artist, I don't like handling chemical dyes. They are carcinogenic. Some natural ones are too, but they are few and far between. This book gives you options to use natural and organic materials to dye your fabrics so you and they are not exposed to carcinogenic baths. You will like this book. It is well organized, easy to use, and may even become your natural dyeing Bible."
5,good teaching book,"great book and great price. easy to understand even for a layman. would highly recommend seller. sorry for the late posting of this review, my fault entirely"
1,Misguided,This book tries to make the case that America has strong policial parties. He should give his Ph.D. back.
5,Fletcher's Mystery in a Biography,"In my opinion, this is one of the most fascinating of Colin Fletcher's very enjoyable writings. While pursuing an on-going project of walking the length of the Colorado River, Fletcher discovered a lonely cave in Nevada with evidence that a remarkable individual had called it home sometime in the early part of the century. Fletcher wondered who this could have been, and what had led him to this very out-of-the-way location (as Colin Fletcher himself had been led there). Years of research and discovery, aided by a not inconsequential amount of dumb luck, led Fletcher to the most probable identity of the cave dweller, and he also learned much about American history along the way. This book is a real-life mystery; it is a biography of ""Chuckawalla Bill"" Simmons and of Colin Fletcher himself; and like all of Colin Fletcher's books, it is also a work of philosophy. Not surprisingly, the ""Man From the Cave"" proves to be a man very much like Colin Fletcher himself."
3,Works okay but not the best,"I'm only rating this a 3 because the way it holds a recipe card requires the top 3/4-1"" to be covered by the little ball. And often times my recipes start right at the top of the card. So it ends up blocking the view of either ingredients or directions. Just take a close look at the picture... and you'll notice the recipe card they are using has a large header! Hope this helps. I'm going to look for a different kind!"
2,Just okay... not the best out there,The reason I didn't like this recipe holder is that it covers the top part of your recipe. In the 'example' shown the recipe doesn't start until 1 inch down on the card... and for most of us that's not the real world. So I just found it frustrating.
4,Stainless Steel Recipe Card Holder,I thought it would be a little taller. But otherwise it is working out great. I would recommend to a friend.
5,Makes my life so much easier,I love this. I have to do a lot of translating recipes from English to Spanish and it was driving me mad trying to sellotape sheets of paper on the wall etc. and now with this Recipe holder it is a snap. I just love the design and because it's stainless steel it will last forever
2,Nothing new here,"For those with no previous training, this is an inoffensive, easily read introduction to a few facets of successful communication. Steven Gaffney presents his advice and opinions in simple terms, accompanied by personal anecdotes to illustrate particular issues. While he does throw in a few non-attributed statistics in the early pages, the overall work is his individual view of how to implement an honesty-is-the-best-policy style. There is nothing disagreeable, certainly, but not much substance. The most useful part of the book is the recommended reading appendix. Gaffney briefly touches almost all the areas of the cited books in less than 100 pages; go to those sources for more thorough and grounded insights."
5,Read this book & your nose won't grow (Pinochio reference),"With all the self-help books out there today, I thought this book was refreshingly different, and much easier to apply to my life. With other books, I often found myself overwhelmed with trying to remember all of the manipulation techniques to influence people or get them to like you. But this book takes a different approach, and implies that you can get ahead by just being honest. Now your probably thinking, as I was, that anyone with good parents or a religious upbringing knows that honesty is best, so why read a book about it? But this book offers specific communication techniques to achieve your goals. I especially liked the tips on the types of wording to use when engaged in a conflict with someone else, such as starting sentences with ""I feel..."" instead of making accusations. It really works!"
2,An unproven laundry list for interpretation,"For those who want easy answers to deciphering drawings, then this book is a *must read.* But reader beware-- this research is not particularly sound and the original text was written in the early 70's, approximately 30 years ago-- and this book was not significantly updated since then. Hello! Our family values and ideas about family have changed since then, but that is not addressed in this volume. An art therapist worth their salt does not use this type of unreliable assessment to work with clients. I apologize for disagreeing with the last reviewer, but I believe this volume is more of a *must avoid* rather than any type of a classic in the field of art therapy."
4,H-T-P guide,"Book is a good guide for House-Tree-Person Drawings analysis. Pictures are a plus. The book is an old version, but haven't found many updated versions for House-Tree-Person Drawings."
2,okay HTP kinetic drawing book,i was hoping for more explainations from this book. You definately need to be a freudian i guess to get more out of hte book. there are plenty of pictures but not enough detail. not a good book if you are just learning to read or interpret drawings
5,Comprehensive book,"First: it is great book full of a lot of examples and connections. And I love it and I can recomend it for everyone who wants to know something about graphic design.But sometimes it lost connection between graphic and polictic, which is important in 1920s and 1930s."
3,Kind of Boring for a book on Graphic Design,"I bought this book for a Graphic Design History Class, and while it gets the job done in an informative sense, it is a rather unimpressive book in my personal opinion. The body copy is incredibly dense, and the illustrations are tiny and save for a few sections, in black and white, which sort of diminishes the impact. I honestly would have rather paid more for a larger textbook with larger, full color illustrations.It does get the job done as a textbook, but I'd kind of expect more from a textbook that is on Graphic Design."
2,small book,The type (copy) and the book itself are really small and hard to read. It's more like a pocket size handbook. I should have done more research before I purchased; I made the inaccurate assumption that art/design books are usually larger in scale. I can't comment on the content of the book because the size of it was such an impediment I stopped reading after a few chapters.
5,Important writer,"Read this. Read all her novels. One after another to take in her accomplishment, namely, capturing the situation of women during a specific historical period yet a situation that is timeless."
5,An absolutely beautiful and mature Artist,"Jewel is one of a kind. An artist of a strong and poetic personality as well as one with a beautiful and mature voice. Foolish Games is a most beautiful album with wonderful and poetic composition, but from the heart. Jewel sings from her heart about daily truths and with a passionate love for her music. She is definately a talented artist and deserves much more than five stars..."
1,Haven't receivemy product till today 16 April 2012,"May I know where the hell is my books .? The one I order in February ?If I not mistaken the usual international shipment only take one month the max, but I haven't receive and no response from the supplier this is ridiculous"
5,Absolutely Oustanding!,"I'd like to start off by saying that I haven't actually read this play; I've seen it. And it was absolutely amazing.I'd never heard of it, but I preorder tickets for all of the shows at a local theatre, and this was the most recent.Basically it is three different monologues, with the only things tying them together the tragedy of the tales, and the fact that they take place in a funeral home (hence the name ""Three Viewings"").They are so perfectly written, so tragic and yet humorous that you don't know whether to laugh or cry yet somehow end up doing both. This is the most outstanding, touching, wonderful play that I've seen, and I've seen quite a few.Buy the book, and you'll be doing yourself a favor. But if the play is every showing near you, get tickets immediately. It is an absolutely outstanding, unforgettable drama."
5,Heady fragrance,"This is the best fabric softener I've EVER used. We have moderately hard water here and my T-shirts were a little scratchy. This softener made my clothes feel like a baby's blanket and even my teenage son, who never notices smells, (think: gym shoes), loves this. I especially like the way it makes bedsheets feel and the geranium scent lasts a long time. The only drawback is that our dog gets a little amorous when he smells it, but then the artificial smelling stuff always did that too."
5,Absolutely no comparison!!!,When a product is hard to come by....then I know it's good!!! Continuous ordering is the way to go with this best smelling fabric softener EVER!!!!!
4,FYI:The dryer sheets leave a longer lasting fragrance,Not saying thats a bad thing but if you are looking for a longer lasting/stronger frgrance the sheets are better for that.
3,Mrs. Meyer's Clean Day Fabric Softner Geranium,"The softner smells nice, but due to having hard water I find I have to use a lot more of it in order for my laundry to feel soft."
1,Mrs. Meyer's Fabric Softner,"I didn't really like this fabric softner, I didn't find that did very much with using just 2 capfulls as directed, even using more wasn't much help. It did leave a clean smeal to the laundry, but not as soft as I would like```````"
2,watch out sensitive skin!,"The lavender-scented fabric softener smelled nice and seemed to do the trick, but caused my boyfriend to break out in hives. Just because it's eco-friendly doesn't mean it's hypoallergenic!"
2,Salba in a bag,"This is ground too finely, it makes a slimey mush in my cereal bowl. I loved the salbe in the bottle, it stayed grainy"
2,EASIER SAID THAN DONE,"This stuff is so sticky that it's hard to sprinkle on food, and any little bits that end up on your dishes or silverware have to be scoured off. Cooking with it is even worse, all you get is clumps. I think I'll stick with my NKO pills."
1,Manufacturer error,"I received some Chopin piano music in this Sills CD case, even with the correct logo burned in.Suspicious..."
3,A little disappointing.,"I absolutly loved Sally Keehn's first book, ""I am Regina"" which is a brutally honest story of a white girl taken captive by Delaware Indians during the French and Indian War. I read ""The Moon of Two Dark Horses"" simply because I enjoyed ""I am Regina"" so much.""The Moon of Two Dark Horses"" is a story of a Delaware Indian boy, Coshmoo, who witnesses the effects the Revolutionary War has on his peaceful and neutral village. Will his village side with the British and their Seneca allies or will the Delawares stay at peace with their American neighbors? War also threatens Coshmoo's personal life. An alliance with the British will ensure lead and powder for his beloved musket, but would endanger his lifelong friendship with an American boy, Daniel. It's a great premise, but Keehn is unable to really pull it off. The narrative is choppy with storylines and characters underdeveloped. A decent book, but not nearly as good as ""I am Regina."""
4,Does what it's supposed to do,"A cheap, convenient way to mount a spare on your trailer. When I was just towing my utility trailer around town I didn't worry much about getting a flat. Once I started traveling longer distances I got myself a spare and this is just the thing I needed to mount it to the trailer tongue."
2,Disappointing,"I love King's playing and have most of what he's recorded on CD. This video however, is very disappointing. The video is bad and the group isn't his usual sidemen."
5,Diz CD iz da BOMB!,"I ordered diz cd cause i heard it on KWIN! here in Cali, and it wuz da bomb....If you want a copy of this single please e-mail me and I will be able to help you.... Thanks- Trek Sanders 2000 TKR Productions. trunks@teamknightrider.com"
5,Color your own Egyptian art,"I had this book when I was a teen-ager, and I used to color it while listening to music, carefully choosing which colored pencils to use for each figure or detail.The drawings are adapted from ancient Egyptian tomb art. So by looking at them we have a glimpse of how the Egyptians saw their world, including their daily lives, their kings and queens, and their gods. They are very detailed, which makes it fun to color.I'd recommend this book for children in middle school and up, and adults who enjoy coloring as a relaxing creative outlet. Younger children who like detailed coloring pictures might do well with it too. I think colored pencils are the ideal medium, though watercolors with a fine brush could work. (Or watercolor pencils--color first and lightly touch with water afterwards to blend the colors...)"
5,Great film!,"I first saw this film on Colorado Public Television last Spring. I ordered a copy then and have since shown it half a dozen times to friends and family. This film is a beacon of light and hope (and truth) amidst so much misinformation surrounding the whole 2012 hysteria. The deeper value in this film is that it provides a grounded view into the pragmatic actions mankind must make to help us transition into a new paradigm of living in harmony with our planet. Do yourself, your family, and your community a favor and show this film to everyone you love and care about."
3,"Informative, but some parts were inappropriately silly","Rigoberto Menchu Tum and the Mayan elders were excellent resources for the belief systems of today's Maya religion and world view. This is the first time I have seen the present day Maya discussing their religion. Very interesting and adds a lot to the subject.However, the geologist/astronomers (with no credentials listed) had little new information to add unless you have never researched MesoAmerican life.The music, segues and the silly 1-800 ad are annoying and a waste of the time of anyone who watches and it reduced the video's value. If it could be edited this could be an excellent video."
2,Pretty boring,"Did not really care for this documentary...so boring, I couldn't even get interested enough to get more than 20 minutes."
1,New Age Lies That Never Happend,"Well,here it is.Dec 22 2012,and the world is STILL intact.Just a shame that so many people believed in lies such as this,when the maya themselves even said that dec 21 wasn't the end.What's funny about this,is how NASA made all of you new age nuts look like complete fools.They know a hell of alot more than some crook author or some crazy pagans."
5,Very informative!,"With all the crazy theories regarding 2012 it is great to have a clear and true perspective. Very well done and informative. I feel it is important to have it told from Nobel Peace Laureate Rigoberta Menchu Tum of Guatemala, and her Mayan elders. This is the story of the people of Guatemala, not of sensationalized media. I highly recommend this documentary, it will provide you with the real story of 2012!"
3,"Inspiring, but not focused on historical Mayan predictions","I did find the movie inspiring, and feel that it has a good message. However, I had hoped that it would delve into Mayan history more - who the Mayans were, and what we know of their predictions, and learn more about the calendar in greater detail. Instead, it focused more on contemporary Mayans, and how they have continue to uphold the belief systems. I think their message was profound and thought provoking, but just be prepared this is not so much based on history or archeology, but rather on spiritual truth.I enjoyed hearing about how the Mayans viewed time & their calendar system, but would have liked to have learned more. And would have like to learn where it came from that the Mayans predicted the end of the world - where did that originate?"
4,Wisdom enough to deal,"Other reviewers have made very good points about the excellent content, the troublesome video production,and the relief at finally understanding this message of the Mayan Calendar 2012.I can only add that as flawed as the production may be, the wisdom that comes through is amazing and wonderful.I finally feel as though I have a sense of what is happening that I can live with, and a way of interacting with the messagesregarding the end times without fear."
2,Pretty much nothing new here!,This is a typical rock band with no original sound at all. Every song -sounds the same. The musicians are fair at best and the vocalist has no emotion at all. I have heard all these guitar solos before everywhere else. Nothing new here. Blues rock fans should look elsewhere. I was bored right at the first playing. Skip this one-----
5,Amazing,"I originally watched this series in fansubs & it instantly forced its way into my 10 top anime ever. Not only is it extremely unique in the story that is told, but the story means so much more because of amazing characters. I've seen this with both the original Japanese voice acting & the dubbed English cast and was please with both. I can't recommend this series enough."
5,Best of 2012 for me,Steins;Gate is amazing. It had me gripped from start to finish. The series is very well written and incredibly animated.
5,An Artistic Masterpiece,"I'm writing this review partly because I LOVE this series. It's my favorite anime. I'm also writing it in order to get the spoiler comment off of the front page.I can't say too much of the plot of part 2 without spoiling it. Though I can say that it stays consistent with how good the first part is.The thing about this series is that it doesn't contradict itself. So many sci-fi stories, movies and shows do this, which totally destroys the sense of reality of the piece of work (within it's own universe of course). Kind of breaks the fourth wall, but that doesn't happen here.The second thing about this series is that the aesthetic qualities of it are just amazing. If you take any episode and just study the camera angles, the different shots and the lighting conditions that they create all through drawings, you will be astounded. This applies to the first part as well. Hell, even the first 2 minutes of the first episode! It's really cool."
5,Awesome,"This show is fantastic. Definitely watch it, but don't give up because part two is when it gets much awesomer."
5,"Steins; Gate: Complete Series, Part 1 (Ltd Edition Blu-ray/DVD)","My grandson and I both love the Steins; Gate Complete Series, Part One. The graphics are beautiful and the storyline is captivating. The characters are quirky, humorus and lovable and you begin to care about their outcome as they are affected by time travel and you get pulled more and more into the story. We enjoyed it so much that we had to get Part Two of the series in order to follow the story to the end. We highly recommend the series if you are a fan of mystery anime."
4,"Good, but.......","More mixing, less ESPN personalities would make this a stronger CD. I guess what caught my ire was the SportsCenter Megamix (or something like that). If I wanted all of that, I would have turned on the TV rather than buy the CD. Otherwise the music was solid... Glad to see there was some Elvis Costello on the disk. Never thought he would have a song that would be considered to ""get the crowd up jumping around"". This will suffice."
5,Fantasic!,"The jar pac is a excellent way to carry around baby food jars with extra space for spoons, napkins, bibs... The jars don't clank together and you can grab it on the go with the convenient handle. The sections are separated by velcro dividers which is great if you want to create a bigger space and store a baby bottle instead of a jar. I bought the bigger size and this size not knowing which would be better and I ended up keeping them both and using them each a lot. I really love them."
4,Very Functional,"Great for organizing baby's food in your diaper bag. Caution: not leak-proof, be sure to properly seal leftovers! Love the slots that hold spoons."
1,Badly acted... and grossly innacurate,"This is a terrible movie with little connection with history. The only thing accurate is that Commodore Perry came to Japan in 1853/4, The rest is pure, unbelievable fiction.I have always been a Toshira Mifune fan and he does the best with this aweful script. Richard Boone is in his ""worst"" role. He mugs and stamps all over the set... and that is about it. A young James Earl Jones has a small part which is equally unenspiring.Stay away."
2,its only a movie,"Not great ,not even very good but mifune?....so much crap comes out of hollywood today that causes the blu ray release of so many good old movies to be put off while we are subjected to american pie,anything with steve carell,teenagers worried about their ""tallywackers""and wher to put them...ILL TAKE NOT VERY GOOD MOVIES BY LEGITIMATE ACTORS EVERY TIME..."
1,Poor Quality Recording,"My complaints are not with the film itself but with the quality of the VHS recording. I ordered this tape brand new and paid full price, but the cassette I received was clearly used and recorded over. The soundtrack from some old news/interview program could clearly be heard overlapping the film dialogue throughout the tape. It's annoying to the point where the tape is unwatchable.Save your money and don't buy this tape."
2,Samurai vs Yankee?,"In support of the previous reviewer's comments, those writers who sneer at the very idea that a western sabreur could triumph over a Samurai are being sadly and deludedly unpatriotic (not a quality usually associated with Americans, let it be said).In fact, there are a number of accounts dating from this period of Samurai being embarrassed by the skill of western opponents - and some of these are Japanese accounts. One may speculate that it was simple culture-shock, but it remains true all the same.As for the film, it's no great shakes, but the fight is credited to a Japanese fight director, and if this is the case he deserves brownie points for a decent bit of difficult choreography."
1,Bushido Blade,"This is the single most entertaining and moving film I can recall seeing in recent years. This film was unbelievably pathetic on so many levels, ie: historical accuracy, writing, acting, plot, theme,etc., I can't begin to comment. It was entertaining in the sense we were throwing things at OUR screen while correcting all the inaccuracies, poor writing and just plain bad acting. I was moved through a variety of emotions while watching this film, including, anger, disgust, nausea, and shock. No mortal is perfect and we all have to eat but how they EVER got the great Toshiro Mifune involved in this film (and role) has to be the ultimate cinematic mystery of our time. My words may sound ""..spiteful.."" but they are as true and accurate as I can make them about this embarrassment of an American film."
2,Disappointed,"Although the dishes were beautiful and exactly what I have been looking for in terms of style, the quality of the dishes was very disappointing. I ordered four sets and found something wrong in each of the sets. The defects ranged from small bubbles, black dots, unfinished spots, small chips, wavy/warped edges and very rough bottoms (problem for stacking). If you want to use these for every day, these probably won't be the dishes for you. The other problem is that I discovered Churchill China sold off this division of Jeff Banks Ports of Call recently and so if you needed replacement from the company it would almost be impossible. I tried to contact them to discuss the quality with them and their website in England doesn't allow that type of contact. Amazon was helpful but the contact they had for the warehouse in the US wasn't the correct location either. So, unfortunately, I sent them back to Amazon."
2,disappointment,"While I still Love the pattern and the color was just what I'd hoped, I received two sets of these dishes and both had air bubbles in the glaze on the plates - showing bare stone in tiny circles all over the eating surface. While Amazon was good to exchange and then return them and provide a refund, I am unfortunately out a large promotional gift certificate and very disappointed with my experience with these plates."
3,pretty dishes,"i have been looking for dishes for quite a while. i purchased a beautiful set from another store, which i loved, but the plates were so large they woulnd't fit in my kitchen cabinets! these are perfect. i only wish the coffee cups were a little larger. the color is a pretty cream with small touches of beige around the border. all in all i am very pleased plus they arrived in perfect condition."
2,Not as nice-looking as I expected and broken pieces,I ordered 2 sets and was disappointed in the appearance of the product. They look a lot better in the picture than in reality and when I opened the first box there was a broken small square bowl. The second box had two chipped plates.Not a satisfactory product.
5,Excellent for the price.,We were looking to match some square china that we had received as a gift.These are fine.
3,nice light movie with more thought than expected,"This movie is basically about a huge tangeld social web involving stolen money, a gangster, his ex-gf, a cop, his gf, two criminals, a shop owner, etc etc.... it's got faye wong and tony leung ka fai in it as well as leslie cheung... as far as these light hk movies go, this is definitely a better one - it's more thoughtful in the way it handles a lot of the material, and isn't all that predictable... worth seeing if you're a fan of any of the actors or the genre."
2,If it weren't for Faye,"This movie is like BEACH, BLANKET, BINGO -- minus the sophistication. However, the acting is generally better.You'll find the usual (for Hong Kong) bad mix of comedy and gangsterism (with surprisingly little gunplay). A very diffuse plot going off on all directions. Unsympathetic characters. And cheap locale shots (I didn't feel the urge to visit Okinawa after this).I rented this to see if Faye Wong could really act without Wong Kar Wai around. I'm convinced now. She's a natural -- tho she doesn't match the depth that Leslie Cheung offers. And it was a huge surprise to hear her speak a line of English near the beginning. I knew she lived in NYC for a short while, but I wasn't expecting it to be so good. She actually makes American English sound quite pretty. (Hear that, Hollywood?!)(A delightful Faye Wong & Wong Kar Wai collaboration can be found inCHUNGKING EXPRESS. She also appeared in his2046)"
3,You can't resist to Faye Wong,"Well, here we have a nice comedy-romance-gangster movie, not revolutionary but fun to see. There's cleary a big influence of Wong Kar Wa in the way of filming, wich makes that movie more than just another holiday movie. And there's Faye Wong (Chungking express, 2046). You can't resist Faye Wong."
1,Worst Sound Quality of any DVD released,"This is one of the greatest singers of our time, but was blown away with the tremendously poor quality of the recording. I have listened to it on a very high end surround system and a cheap system. Both sound absolutely terrible. It sounds like they stuck a mic in the 35th row down on the floor. The echo is terrible. Looks like they'll need a do-over at some point. I couldn't watch 5 minutes it sounded so bad."
5,Get Your Money's Worth with This One!,"I think this is an excellent DVD. Sound quality is good...I didn't notice it being bad like I had read. Anyone who loves Simply Red will love this DVD. It gives an option of having the lyrics on screen....and I liked that.It is about 2 hours, so you get your money's worth!The only thing missing was any additional footage like behind the scenes."
2,"Excelent performance & song choice, but poor sound","When I got this DVD, I was pleasently surprised by track listing - lots of songs from first 3 albums - which are, on my opinion, the best of their entire career. The performance is also very good and interesting, but the sound is another story...I have pretty good hi-fi (with surround) system and I just couldn't believe how poor this DVD sounds. Stereo sound (which I prefer) sounds like an old audio tape and surround is even worse with lots of ""uncontrolled"" echoe.With better sound, this dvd would get much better rating (4-5 stars)..."
5,fabulous performance and production values!,"I am not a huge Simply Red fan...at least I wasn't until I saw this DVD...wow, what a great performance and fabulous production values....this puts the new McCartney DVD to shame. The Eurythmics have a wonderful DVD out as well that is similar in quality with a great deal of bonus material which would have been the icing on the cake for the simply red DVD.I knew many of the songs but the ones I didn't are fairly memorable the first time through. The camera angles, lighting , stage design are all designed for beauty and to keep the show from stagnating and all are splendid. The sound is simply fabulous as well.This is a great 2hrs and 26 tracks with a sort of Jazzy vibe to the arrangements which I find particularly pleasing..oh yeah, and on his signature song ""Holding Back the Years"" Mick performs solo with an acoustic guitar and it is the perfect touch.HIGHLY recommended"
2,Just... not good,"I bought this book while sick hoping for an easy, fun comfort read. To some extent it filled that role. I did read it, it was easy, but I can't say I enjoyed it. The plot is OK. If you are into figuring out mysteries you won't have a problem with this one - nothing to challenging here. The conclusion seems cut off and unfinished (not in a good In The Woods way but in the lazy way)- like the author knew the how but no the why of her crime. The big issue is with the main character. There is just no ""there"" there. I got about 2/3 of the way through before I figured out she was supposed to be ""almost 30"". REALLY? She reads like middle aged conservative DAR member. I kept wondering why all the other characters seemed to like her. Oh well. Knitting mystery - I got what I paid for."
3,Great if there's nothing else,"I am a knitter,so I generally enjoy stories about other knitters. This one was diverting up until halfway through when I realized the protagonist was ignoring her child who was obviously upset by the murder. Then when I realized the murder had something to do with patterns,I lost interest. I love a good pattern as much as the next person, but killing for the money and prestige from knitting patterns would be like committing murder in order to take credit for a good recipe. I was laughing at the end,and there wasn't even the zing of a good romance. I think I need a different genre, one with more quirky characters. These were too normal for me."
4,Knitting and mayhem!,"This is a great book. The plot is well formed and as a mystery, this is truly one that takes enough twists and turns that you cannot figure out the whole thing until the very last section, which for me as a read is very important. I found the main character was an easily likable woman who was witty and fun to stay with throughout the book. I was actually a little sad when I had to finish the book and let her go her own way. The tension between the characters is really good and this author knows how to insert humor where it is needed to make for a fun, light read. I would definitely recommend this book to mystery lovers or anyone looking for a fun read."
4,Excellent Mystery with A Knitting Theme,"This entertaining mystery introduces us to Ariadne Evans, owner of a knitting shop in a small town in Rhode Island. When one of her cantankerous customers is found strangled to death in her shop, Ariadne gets involved in trying to find the murderer. The mystery in this story was very well-told. Although the murder scene is a yarn shop, there is not so much talk about knitting in this book. Non-knitters will enjoy this book as well!The characters in this story were well developed and believable. I really liked the main character Ariadne. She is a person I'd like to know. I'm definitely looking forward to the next story in this series."
4,a great yarn,I really enjoyed Died in the Wool: A Knitting Mystery (Knitting Mysteries) it was a great change from my other reading. if your a knitter and a mystery fan this book for you enjoy it ~
2,Awful!,"Let's leave aside the total impracticality of someone making enough cash off pirated knitting patterns to make it worth killing for... and we'll leave aside the use of ""Omigosh"" about a dozen times in the first chapter... and we'll forget about the use of everyone's name each time they're spoken to (how often do YOU use your friend's name while in conversation with them?)...The book is still not so great. The plot was transparent, the characters were wonky and wooden, and the whole thing was poorly plotted and choppy.That said, I'll still probably read the rest in the series because it's about knitting, and I'm a sucker like that."
2,WRONG COPY,This was the wrong copy for my region and i was unable to play it.I need a copy that can be played in Australia.
5,One Awesome Movie,"Don't let the year this movie came out hold you back from seeing or buying this film! This movie is extremely badass!! The 80's (although cheesy at times) did have some sweet ass movies under it's belt. Even if you don't know anything or even like surfing, you'll dig this movie. It's a must buy!!!! I watch it at least twice a year. Where I live you can't even rent it, so I'm thinking of renting mine out because all my friends and family are always wanting to borrow it! It is a kick ass movie that everyone should enjoy at least once!"
5,"cause when the surf's bad, nobody works","For a movie that was panned by the critics, people sure do quote a lot of lines from the movie. Sure the acting isn't the best, the plot is a bit sketchy, but there is something about this movie that just sticks with you. Especially Turtle. I've seen this movie at least 50 times and never get tired of seeing it. I only wish it would come out on DVD."
4,This is a fun 80's surf movie,"This is a fun 80's surf movie, it sort of started the craze of surfing is cool again. There are some great shots of Hawaii's north shore and some surfing giants from the past co-staring."
4,A movie that makes you want to surf.,"While most movies with bad acting would make you run for the door or your remote control, North Shore uses excellent scene sequences and quick action to make anyone want to learn to surf. Turtle is by far the best actor in this movie, playing the role of the misunderstood local surfer. Watch this movie not with your intentions on being emotionally moved by the acting, but rather the story that is told. Great cameos by pro surfers. Great shots of the waves."
1,DONT EVER ORDER FROM THIS GUY,I couldnt even watch the video b/c it was a pirated video. Thats illegal and Amazon should have no part of that.
3,Karate Kid It Ain't,"I hesitate to give this movie a bad review. Judging by some of the other comments, it's become a mini cult classic, but someone has got to give a little balance. While this movie may have some plot resemblances with Karate Kid it is a thouroughly B movie. Bad acting, bad writing, bad music, cheap sets etc. But it is fun, and if you go in expecting B then you can enjoy it. It does have Laird Hamilton in it and it's got some great surfing. It's got a lot of heart and a great babe in it although she's more Philipina than Hawaian, not that it matters because she's beautiful."
2,Weak,"As a movie it doesn't work. A kid from Arizona going to the North Shore and dazzling the locals, unlikely. Maybe if the movie had a single bit of wit, intelligence, or comedy it would work but it takes its plot too seriously. Its surprising that a movie with such a weak plot and bad acting could be made. The surfing scenes are excellent but they're not anything that hasn't been seen in surfing documentaries like the ""Endless Summer"" films. This bad movie is just an excuse to show the beautiful waves of the North Shore and a couple of famous surfers."
3,"Alright, but don't expect it to last more than 3 years.","While the unit worked, it worked pretty well. Programming it was easy, it did it's job. But over time, the motor started to wear out and the piece that spins in order to release food into the bowl became weak. Weak enough to stop turning food into the bowl. Unfortunately, the warranty is for a year."
2,Make sure you clean and oil it!,"I loved this pet feeder (I bought the medium size) until it stopped working after using it only 2 months. The company troubleshooted with us and we found food crunched up and jammed around the auger. We had to clean it and oil it as recommended. It never worked the same after that and within 3 weeks, the auger and twistie thing no longer turned. I have contacted the company, and they've agreed to send me a new one. I will try to avoid this from happening again by cleaning around the auger every week, and I recommend the same advice to all who have one or purchase one."
1,"Works ok, but not for long. Very unreliable!","I bought the feeder and waterer as a set. The water bottle leaks at a glued seam at the top, which empties the water bottle. I'm on my third water bottle in six months,and now my second pump for this waterer is dead. All of the water bottles had the same failure.The feeder worked OK but now is also dead after six months. I really tried to keep these things going since they were nice when working, but I'm giving up. This feeder and waterer cost a lot of money to be so unreliable. I expected more that a problem ridden 6 months. I would not recommend buying this brand."
1,Not reliable after only 6 weeks of use.,"I just came home tonight and I noticed only 2 Tablespoons of food in the Dog's tray.Normally the machine dispenses for 2 minutes, or about 2 cups of dog food. The poor dog would starve if I hadn't noticed this.I will attempt to contact the manufacturer on Monday. The warranty is only for 90 days and this should have been a clue to me prior to purchasing a $140 piece of plastic.."
2,Great Feeder that doesn't last,"Easy to program, Love being able to be very precise on the time. However, both the unit and timer broke after two years. The unit would and would not drop food. Never good figure out why. One day it would work fine, the next day it wouldn't. We bought a new unit and used the old timer since it was already programmed. Unfortunately, the old timer didn't last too long after that. We found out after a power outage that the internal battery in the timer would not hold a charge. Our cat was real angry about these problems. Hopefully, the new unit will hold up better.Dan"
1,BAd Quality/Not Dependable,"My first feeder arrived broken. The auger was detached from the motor. But construction did not impress me. Cost was the factor in my choice of this feeder. The second one jammed frequently (obvious poor design). Then, probably because of jamming, the auger detached from the motor on that one, too. It is not possible for the owner to fix this. Much too expensive for the lack of dependability. I travel frequently and the feeder provides a way to avoid the cost of a pet sitter. Definitely will try something different - probably more expensive."
1,Junk,I bought this to feed my 3 cats. It worked for about 2 weeks and then it just quit. It will not dispense the food at all anymore and just makes a whirring noise. It is also cheaply made as a small plastic part broke at the bottom. I am sending it back.
3,Does the job that it was intended to do,"Hard to initially program and even harder to change that program. I gave up and left it on DST. Timer is accurate but be sure to try it with the size food you intend to use. It strictly uses a timer, not quantity of food. I still have no clue how to really clean it."
2,small auto per feeder,This pet feeder worked great - until it didn't. It broke after 1 year and 3 months. Kind of expensive for such a short time.
1,Extremely Unreliable,"Terrible product and terrible customer support. It was a complete waste of money. I bought the small version of this feeder for my cats. The motor broke, it was replaced, it broke again. The auger broke. Since it is totally unreliable I cannot count on it when I go away. DO NOT BUY."
1,good idea poor design,"I was so excited when the ergo pet food feeder and waterers first came into my life. That was before I owned them.The feeder was working great...until the motor broke..got a replacement....then the auger broke...got a replacement...the list goes on. I have two large ones sitting in pieces. Customer service?....hahahaha..there is basically one guy running the show who answers emails and phones eventually...the waterer arrived broken....the replacement bottle also arrived broken...the third replacement lasted about a month before it split along the mold seam..got one of these sitting in pieces too...I give up.""0"" stars for product""0"" stars for customer servicesorry to see these on Amazon"
3,Great product - Could be great with slight modification,"We have a fat cat who can't monitor his intake. Whenever we wanted to go away even for a day, we couldn't leave the cat and had to pay to have it go to cat kennel; however, with the pet feeder we can go away worry free for a few days. Also, you can set up to eight feedings a day which is nice because he can get a bunch of small meals and he doesn't bother us for food anymore (although he sits by the feeder alot).The problem is that because the horizontal auger (good idea) comes all the way out to the feeder whole. Even our cat (not very smart) was able to figure out how to jiggle the auger to get food whenever he wanted. We had to cover the whole and dish with some metal to keep his paws out. After getting it all in place, it works well, but the cats will keep trying so we had to try a few different things before we could ensure he wasn't getting too much food."
1,It doesn't work well,"I try to use it when I went on vacation. It only work for a few time. Then I have to ask a friend to come and feed the dog every day. The product grinds up my dog food so all the ""powder"" dog food got stuck at the bottom and plug up the machine and broke one of a piece of metal. I'll return it if I can."
4,Pretty good product,"Programming is a bit tricky especially since it dispenses food by time, not volume, but it is flexible and has worked well.Seems well-made."
1,Junk! One 'star,Had For 6 months nothing but trouble not easy to set doesn't put out the same amount Food comes out when u move it. Auger broke! using small kible.Great Idea But Look for something else to expensive too. save your money JUNK
2,"Complicated, overpriced, and prone to breakdown","I bought this feeder about a year ago. It feels sturdy and heavy, so I thought it was well constructed. But the control mechanism for it is pointlessly complicated. You have to press some couple of dozen poorly-labeled buttons to set impossibly precise timing controls. I know that I need to feed my cats a third of a cup. How am I supposed to how many seconds of being ""on"" that equates to? Why should I be asked to know?I figured this was the worst of it, but as of just now it's stopped working. I can verify that the control mechanism is working fine, but something inside the feeder itself is now broken. And it has been engineered with tamper proof screws, so I can't even get inside to try and debug the thing myself. It's less than a year old, and a breakdown this quickly is just unacceptable.Between the pointlessly complicated timer, annoyingly inaccessible engineering, and high price tag, I do not suggest this one."
3,OK Feeder,"Recently bought this to replace a ""Pet Bistro"" feeder which was useless. This one is a little better, but difficult to figure out the right portion amount when feeding my cat. They have since taken care of the problem of the cat's ability to get into the chute to obtain more food. But the timer, programming is tricky. Got this for when we travel and it should be ok."
5,Smart Feeder for busy houshold,"Have used this feeder for over a month and it has sucessfully un-associated me with food from our cats point of view. We have two cat (16 lb adult and 7 lbs growing ex-kitten).The feeder setup was simple (for me, I'm good with that kind of stuff). Figuring out the correct amount to set on the timer took a couple weeks of monitoring to insure they were not be over/under fed. Current setting are for 7 minutes of food delivery per day over four different feed times.The timer read out is smallesh (reading glasses required for everything at my age) but is not a big deal. Well build, should last for many years.Would buy it again, wife approves of it as well."
3,Best option I could find,"I have two 6 month old kittens who were steadily becoming obsessed with feeding times. They would wake my husband & I up at 1am, 3am, 5am, etc. Therefore, I researched all the auto feeders I could find & decided to purchase this one. When first turned on, it did simply dump the food - however after some experiments with the timer it now seems to be working fine. One cat has figured out how to slide his paw under the door flap to grab a few kibbles, however as noted in other reviews, he's just robbing from his next portion, not getting extra food. While this was an expensive purchase I am currently very happy with it; our kittens are now used to the routine of the machine feeding them, not us. Now we sleep through the night & the machine feeds them at 4am."
1,not worth the money,"I bought this based on the favorable reviews on amazon and was disappointed to find that when you read the operations manual, this feeder only accepts a certain shape (round)and diameter of food. Also, our cat figured out how to self feed after 4 hours. So I don't recommend this product. It's not worth the money."
1,Broke...Twice.,"I purchased the Ergo feeder for my cats so they could be fed on a more strict schedule than my military service allowed. Considering the money I spent, I thought I was getting a very high quality product. Not so much.The first one:The hopper jammed, then the timer pretty much went haywire and kept feeding until the blasted thing emptied food all over the floor.So I contacted Amazon. They were highly helpful, as usual, and immediately sent out a new one.The second one:The hopper jammed, then some ""internal"" component broke.I gave up and tossed the thing. Bought myself the Petmate feeder ($60 cheaper!) and have been using it successfully without a hitch for over a year."
5,"Great Album, But Don't Waste Your Time With Amazon","I placed an order with Amazon for this and 6 months later they told me it was unavailable. I hope they don't consider this good customer service and how about updating the availabilty of this product on their site. Amazon, please don't waste the time and effort of somebody else :("
3,Good but not Great..........,"I'm a huge Yes fan so I decided to bid on a brand-new ""Fish Out of Water"" CD on Ebay and won it for only $10 or $11. Track numbers one and four are my favorites as this rest of the CD seems a little boring and repetitious at times. I must agree with most of the other reviewers here and say that Chris's voice is best suited for back-up purposes only. As usual Chris's bass playing is very enjoyable."
4,"Excellent album, why did I wait so long?","If ""Fish Out of Water"" had a been a late-70s Yes album, the train might've stayed on the tracks a bit longer. Instead we got ""Tormato"" and ""Going for the One"". Not quite up to the standard of the Holy Trinity of ""The Yes Album"", ""Fragile"" and ""Close to the Edge"".The songs on ""Fish Out of Water"" are very good compositions, the song structures are much more interesting than the slapdash affairs on the later Yes albums. This album has also aged much better than other prog excursions from this era, i.e. some of the Bill Bruford solo works."
5,An unexpected gem,"Chris Squire's first and only solo album is absolutely stunning. The heart of Yes (as he is the only man to appear on every recording), Chris Squire brings great songwriting and excellent singing to the table in a disc that even outshines some of Yes's work."
4,HOLD OUT WHILE I RAMBLE,"This is a great album. You are a YES fan no doubt.""Hold Out Your Hand"" is complete Chris Squire and true progressive rock. This album has all the qualities you would expect of such music. It isn't Genesis or Jethro Tull but it is unique and very enjoyable. Prog rock has been unfashionable for bloody years but in it's hey day there was no finer rock music to delight your ears. YYYAAAWWWNNN.(Pipe and slippers). Seriously, this album rocks! If you are a YES fan then buy it, what the hell are you doing?"
5,The Best Rock Bassist and This Proves It,"""Fish Out of Water"" epitomizes why Yes is one of the greatest rock bands of all time. There is so much talent individually and collectively. This album has it all. Rock, orchestrations, harmony, the works. The movement from song to song is astounding. There is not a bad song on here with classics such as ""Silently Falling"" and ""The Cannon Song"". Beautiful music but with a beat that doesn't quit. The flute, horns, and bass are the best. Squire's bass is incredible on this album and the orchestrations help to show the true class of this bassist. This is a must buy for anyone who truely appreciates music."
2,A glorified Tootsie Roll,"If you're expecting anything resembling actual fudge, you will be very disappointed. This tasted like a Tootsie Roll, except, with a funny aftertaste. I brought them to work to fill the desktop candy dish because I didn't like them very much and they're still there. It's been weeks, that never happens. I guess this would work if you're wanting a portable chocolate-like snack, but please don't expect ""fudge."""
2,About as readable as court documents,"I bought this book almost three years ago and every time I delve into it the writing style has me so bored I can't make it beyond the first chapter. The author is so busy documenting that this book becomes about as dry as a heap of court paperwork. While the events described may make a good tabloid documentary someday, this particular book is better left as source material for another writer."
5,Treasure trove of dirt on the Bushes,"The George Bush in the title is Bush 41, not Bush 43. You find binLaden and George W. Bush (43) each mentioned twice in the 400 page book. Interestingly the mentions are all within two pages of each other, and concern a national guard buddy of W getting a contract to manage the financial affairs of one of the bin Ladens, back in the late 60s or early 70s. So there is a good chance W and Osama ore old friends! The book chronicles a lot of shady stuff the family has been mixed up in for a long time. It's not an easy read but it is like looking at source data and you can make up your own mind. At the time this book was written, the idea that W would ever be in important government position was not on anybody's mind."
4,What's in a relationship?,"Apparently not sex-necessarily. In this book, Brehony and Rothblum explore the lives of lesbian women who, for whatever reason, omit sex from their relationships. The authors' inclusion of theoretical models, personal accounts, and discussants effectively illustrates portraits of real people who make conscious decisions about their sexuality- not women who are controlled or defined by existing social constructions. The book powerfully raises philosophical questions about the nature of relationships in general- for example, what is a relationship without sex? The book calls all people to question the nature and purpose of their own sexuality. I omit one star simply for its lack of historical and statistical data. However, the book serves its purpose- recognizing and attempting to understand relationships that have previously been undiscussed."
1,wrong size socks,"I ordered these socks through Amazon, as sold by National. Although I carefully ordered the correct size, they are much too big. Even after washing and drying several times, they are still too big. They appear to be a men's size ten, rather than a women's 10 as ordered. I recommend you skip this item."
3,Soft & Thin but size issues,"The socks are a good quality. My feet sweat a lot with other socks. They still sweat but a lot lesser. The material is fine too. But the manufacturer's sizing chart needs to be amended. According to their chart for women's shoe size 7-9, sock size is ideal. I wear 7.5 size shoes but the socks are 2 sizes bigger."
5,Cotton socks,My wife has some allergies to some fabrics. These are all cotton and fit well. She does not have any allergic reactions to these socks.
3,Buster Brown Anklets,"I was somewhat disappointed with my purchase of Buster Brown Anklets. When I opened the package I thought for sure I received the wrong size as I had ordered size small (I wear a size 7 shoe). I thought if I washed them they would shrink some, but not enough. My sister wears a size 9 shoe, guess I'll give them to her. Wish I had known they run large."
4,Good for the most part,"I prefer cotton socks, and the Buster Brown 100% Cotton Socks fit the bill. But, I have difficulty with the tops wrinkling as I go through my day wearing them. Still, they do make a wonderful extra layer under some of my other socks."
1,These have elastic on the top of the sock,"I bought a few of these socks to test and they do have elastic on the rim of the sock. If your looking for 100% real cotton socks, try Cottonique. Cottonique makes socks that are really 100% all-Cotton and have NO Elastic at All."
2,Not the old fashioned Buster Brown Socks,These socks are not as good as they once were. The stretch out of shape too fast and slide down in your shoes really bad.
4,I really like them so far.,"My feet really sweat all the time, I have tried many diffrent brand, and tried to use materials that have the most cotton, still they did not work as well as these pairs, now my wife, my daughter and myself have swithched completly to these socks, and so far very happy,Just remember you need to order at least one size bigger than your shoe size.Hope this helps someone."
1,they cause rash on my feet and ankles,"I ordered 6 pairs of ""100% cotton"" black socks, 2 pairs of tan, 2 pairs of off white. I now have a rash on feet and ankles. They must have a trace of elastic... spandex or lycra... elastine. something is causing this rash. disappointing. especially at that price plus shipping."
3,Very thin socks,"The Buster Brown 100% cotton socks I bought through Amazon are okay. They are cool and comfortable. I had wanted thicker, white cotton socks like the ""bobbie socks"" we wore in the 50's. These socks are very thin and have thin ridges on top. I will wear them but they are not exactly what I wanted. These socks, like so many other traditionally American products, are now made in China! I had no idea I was purchasing a ""Made in China"" product. After all, I always bought the thick, beautiful Buster Brown socks at our best store on Main Street in my American hometown. There went the quality of this product. Shame on you Buster Brown!"
2,lines,the ridges made it uncomfortible price not so bad. when you need 100 cotton it s not good to have line.ridges on the foot part of the sock.
1,Size 10 Socks Didn't Match My Size 10 Feet,"I have size 10 feet and ordered the size 10 socks. The calf-height was fine. The socks were a bit long and extended past my toes. I purchased them because of their ""no chemicals added"" pledge."
3,Terrible sizing,Sizing doesn't even come close to the chart. I should have listened to the other reviews. Very disappointing. Would not buy these again.
1,Made in China,"When I saw the ""made in China"" on the packaging, I should have sent them back unopened. I was desperate to have socks without spandex and latex in so I kept them. That was a big mistake. I don't know what was in those socks, but if you are looking to buy these socks because of allergies, save your money. I bought them because so many people with allergies claimed they were good. I don't know when Buster Brown moved their manufacturing to China, but these socks are toxic. I had to give them 1 star because zero wasn't an option."
1,No proper sizing chart,"I can not give a complete review for these socks as they are way too big to wear comfortably with athletic shoes. The generic chart by Amazon was not specific enough, so I found the Buster Brown chart at the seller's website for these socks. I wear a size 8 athletic shoe, so a size 10 sock was ordered as specified by the chart.The size 10 socks received were more for a person with a size ten shoe, not size 8. I don't believe the size 9 would have fit much better. I sent them backThe material quality is very cheap for the price. It's the exact material used for cotton underwear and very thin. They don't look like they are going to hold up to many washings"
5,Great Socks for the Handicapped at Amazon.com,I have been looking for socks my wife could wear for years. I have finally found them. She says that these are the most comfortable socks she has ever worn. They are virtually seamless in the toe and fit with plenty of toe room. My wife is extremely happy and suffers a lot less foot pain. Thank you Buster Brown!
5,perfect!!!,This item arrived on time and new as described. this allowed me to include them i n a Christmas package
5,Amazing idea,Once I get one of these I will keep it in my wallet!I Ashley carry 2 knives so this is great for three
3,It's just a hook,"It's just a hook and doesn't do anything special; I suppose it can't be great nor can it be awful. I do wish it fit over the standard cubicle wall at my work: it doesn't, so I had to disassemble the top of the cubicle wall and slide the hook in, then reassemble. This was slightly annoying."
4,Pretty Handy,"I just received my set screw assortment and I'm quite impressed. There are many very useful sizes and quite a few of each (some sizes include 30 each)! The only con to the set is the included organizer. It does not close and does not have actual hinges. It just has flaps that act as hinges and from experience, those don't last long. With a slightly better organizer, this set would deserve 5 stars!"
3,set screws,"I aam sure these would be useful if they fit the product I needed them for, but so far the thread size has kept me from using them. I was hoping one would fit my sawsaw, but it didn't."
5,"This is the Prequel to ""Hunters' Moon"" it's where the whole","thing started! What started out as a simple camping out, turns into a nightmare! What's worse is that the local werewolf is taking names and his classmates are his victims. But something unexpected happens, and now the cocky hunter has an enemy he hadn't counted on. But which will be the winner in a battle to the Death? Plus learning to deal with being a werewolf isn't so easy either. There's new rules & stuff to learn about. Having a bloodthirsty, bad to the bone male werewolf around doesn't make things any easier. Add to that the fact he's after your friends, and you!"
1,"Dissapointing, very dissapointing","Little Men is my favorite book in the world. I was expecting this movie to be cute and sweet just like the book. But instead, I was very very very dissapointed. It was as if they said, ""Let's make a movie based on the book 'Little Men'!"" and then created their very own story, almost completely different from the book. First of all, they barely even introduced the kids. Second, Dan was supposed to be an orphan, not an adopted kid who was overly attached to his ""father"" and was sent to Plumfield because the ""father"" was being bugged to put him in a school. Most of the movie was about a plot that wasn't even in the book!!! How awful can you get? I think someone should completely remake the movie, and actually make it at least the tiniest bit like the book! Right when the movie started, I was dissapointed, but I gave it a fair chace and watched the rest of the movie, but it was TERRIBLE!!! It was hardly recognizable as 'Little Men' except for the names...that was it!!!"
1,Alcott reduced to slapstick,"Unfortunately, I got this for my daughter, who is reading virtually all of the classic kids books. We were barely 30 seconds into this when she became angry at how far the film is from the book, making it into a kind of idiotic comedy rather than the subtle social commentary from the original, adding characters not in the book, etc. Moreover, many of the aspects of Jo's situations are changed in ridiculous ways, such as putting their occupancy of the school at risk as a plot device. Also, this film makes a horrible mash of the characters, such as Jo's husband, who comes off as a naive buffoon.This is a perfectly awful version that betrays the book's depth for comedy effects. Not recommended."
2,DON'T BOTHER...,"Louisa May Alcott would roll over in her grave were she to see the mish-mosh made of her book of the same name. This black and white film is simply a poor excuse of an adaptation, as it bears little resemblance to the book. Consequently, it falls far short of success.Though the film has some good actors in it, with Kay Smith most successful in reprising the role of Jo, the actors simply cannot overcome the third rate script with which they have to work. Quite frankly, I could not wait for the film to end and breathed a sigh of relief when it was finally over."
3,"Rare, but is it worth the money?","1935, black and white - This is a very early version of Little Men, but I read somewhere it was the closest to the book. The picture was ok except for a few scratches and rolls. The sound quality was poor.I thought all the children were good actors. The adults were good too, but I always pictured Jo and Prof Baer differently. Some of the actors looked familiar, but the only one I recognized was Dickie Moore.I'm glad I had a chance to see this movie, but I thought it should have cost less."
4,Toyko Toyko-Where art thou Tokyo,"A little on the twisted side, which is why I enjoyed it. Having lived in Tokyo I could follow the story pretty well though I never I got to see this side!! <No Pun intented>But it has convinced me to move back to Tokyo!"
2,Tokyo Dullness,"I saw this film about seven years ago when it was touring the second string art houses. (I don't live near a first string art house.) I genuinely love foreign film and Asian film in particular. I prefer subbed to dubbed because it lets me hear the emotions directly. However this film's excellent imagery was not sufficient to overcome its dull and not particularly erotic plot. It wasn't a total waste of time, but there are better ways to spend time than watching this film."
2,about this movie Tokyo Decadence.....,"There is, in fact, no story in this movie but only ro say that the actress, in the first opening shot of the movie, finding finding the actor in the last part of the story. All the sex scene performed are 'crazy' and the last sex scene showed that the men were forced to drink the pee of the woman!....I would say that this is not a nice film to watch."
1,A tiny little fatal flaw in his assertion,"I very much wanted to like this book. Unfortunately Gentry's basic assumptions are wrong, therefore his conclusion is wrong.... and grossly so.What Gentry calls ""polonium halos"" are not polonium halos: they are radon halos, constructed as the result of alpha particle cascades following inculted pathways in the rock matrix of assorted minerals. He should have known this fact, since at least one of his samples was collected at a uranium mine.Gentry has been corrected on this subject many hundreds of times after his book was published. Gentry should have had a physicist check his hypothesis first, before publishing the book. But of course Gentry is a Creationist, and the last thing a Creationist will ever do is have a scientist or two check his cherished and much hoped for beliefs.Which is a shame: Gentry is a good person. It is sad to see him making a fool of himself over such a simple and basic error."
1,Pityful,"Was billed as a ""How to"" video, but's really a ""Don't try this at home kids"". After all these guys have had weeks (their words not mine) of training.Slow, boring, badly shot, poor sound (turn it up I can't hear!) mainly consists of one man talking.I'm asking for my money back."
4,Cute story,"But, read the product dimensions because it is not even a big book let alone a ""Great Bigbook"". Cute story, though, and the kids like it so I'm happy enough."
4,This one by Missy is actually not that bad,One of the two are three good Missy songs that is actually worth my time this was from 1997 this was a good song one of her few good songs I will recomened this to people.Lyrics 8/10 Production 10/10 Overall 9/10
5,Good book!,"This book is an old one, but a very good one! It moves along swiftly and kept me interested all the way through. I really recommend it!"
1,"Growing Season and My Enemy, My Love","These two books were forgettable. There was no plot in either of these, and the characters were 1 dimensional. Loved The Bride of The MacHugh."
4,this lock needs to come with instructions and pictures!!!,"Good Lock the thief had bolt cutters and cut up my frame to get to a more valuable bike that U Locked his self onto my rear frame parts. Two other bikes locked together had used this on the main frame of both bikes. My loss due to ignorance. What was weird was the answer was right under my nose what would make this work. two more expensive bikes locked this way were safe and untouched! Right there! Use this on two bikes and only on the main frame. The more valuable the bike the more lock use intelligence necessary. The source of the theft is drug addiction, and illegal immigration. All of this we attract into our own space because spiritually many of us are wrong in a similiar way. Instead of help we become part of the problem if we don't understand the problem of what we deserve,when to stop growing or getting more, and where we belong.ouivalerie@yahoo.com"
1,Don't buy!!!!!!!!,"I bought this lock brand new and it broke in less than a month. The key was jammed and I had to call my college's service person to saw the lock off my bike, and he told me that a lot of people have the same problem with the master bicycle lock. The lock came with a warranty, so I mailed them the broken lock (which costs 7 bucks) and they never sent me a new lock or replied."
1,do not buy,"this lock did fine for 2 months. then i started having trouble with the key/ lock. now it's completely stuck, no amount of tinkering will get it to unlock. if only it weren't locking my frame to a post."
3,Light duty scarecrow,"Think of it as a deterrent rather than real heavy-duty protection. When closed it looks fairly sturdy and may keep thieves away, but when open it looks like a 2 foot lever could break it open without much effort.On the theory that a really determined thief can steal almost anything, but the casual felon is easily deterred, I think it's sufficient for limited use in low crime areas on lower value property."
5,Awesome slippers. My wife loves them.,Her shoe size is 7.5. The 7 fits her perfectly.They're cute & durable. Nice firm sole.
2,Dissapointed,"I ordered a pair of these slippers about four years ago and loved them. I needed a new pair and ordered these and was so dissapointed by them. The are not nearly as cushioned as my previous pair, the soles are not as heavy duty and the make a weird crackle noise when you walk. I actually ordered another pair, an upgrade in price, but they were exactly the same an were returned. My four year old pair were just like UGG slippers, these new ones are not even close."
5,Snuggly,super soft to the touch and nice thick padding under the foot. hot pink ! what more cud ya ask for !
4,What a Deal!,I've seen similar items for $60. Quality is very good. So what if they're not from Australia!
5,Love them!!!!!!,"I was so very happy to come across this color! I have used this brand of slipper for several years now and have been very happy with them. If you are looking for a slipper that has loads of padding, then these are not for you, they are comfortable but not super padded. They are very comfy (in my opinion)!"
1,slippers,These are great slippers! They're a good quality pair of slippers. Very warm and cozy! I will definitely be buying them again next year.
5,Great for Men too!,"I wear a men's size 9 and know from experience with Birkenstocks that is the equivalent of a women's size 11 so I bought a pair of these after my LB Evans turned out to be junk that fell apart. So far I LOVE these - really soft and warm inside - I don't want to take them off! The real sheepskin is SO much nicer than the artificial fuzz in many slippers. Really nicely made slippers with sturdy soles but they have been super comfortable walking around the house today. These are totally a unisex slipper - just be sure to adjust the sizing if you are a dude. I can tell you for sure these are MUCH better than LB Evans, and are so soft and warm you will not want to take them off your feet!"
2,Too wide!,These are nice slippers but they run very wide. 7M felt more like a wide or even extra wide. If you have wide feet they will be great!!
3,loose fit,"Shoes are very, very warm which is what I wanted BUT they really fit loosely after just a week of use and I have trouble keeping them on. I wear an 8 1/2 shoe and ordered size 9. I keeping walking out of the shoes even inside the house. Had I tried them on at store I would have said the sole is very hard but because of warmth would have purchased. In hind sight I would have ordered another pair."
5,Warm slippers!,"I purhased these slippers a few months ago, and love them. I am about to order another pair. They are the best slippers I've ever owned. I bought a size lower than I usually wear and they fit perfectly.They are so warm and comfortable. Great slippers!"
2,Looks warm but is not,"There is a lot of shearling on the inside, which makes a tight fit for my foot inside the slipper. So I agree with other reviews to size up, if you are a 1/2 shoe size. What really bothers me about the slipper is that it doesn't keep my feet warm while I'm wearing them inside my 65-degree heated house. Not even my toes are warm. It doesn't make sense, but these slippers are definitely not as warming as they look."
2,Just so-so,"These slippers are very soft & cozy. However, the soles are completely flat and hard. As soon as the fluff wears down I know they won't be very comfortable.So overall, I'm disappointed. I have had slippers that looked similar to this but that had more give in the soles."
2,Lasted about a month before the white fluff wore off...,not a very good value at all unless you don't mind them falling apart within about a month...they were great for the first couple weeks but I started noticing all this white fuzz on the carpet...then finally all of it came off of the heel of my slippers and after being washed they smelled kinda leathery too. I threw them out!
2,not what they used to be,"I've bought several pairs of this style slipper and loved them all. This pair, however, has a very uncomfortable seam along the outside edge of the foot bed. Too bad - I've worn through all the shearling on my current pair and the nights are getting chilly."
5,Very Nice Slippers they run 1 size big. Size 12 ladies this is for you!,"I wear a size 12N womens and the 11M fit me. They stay on just fine now but I do think when they wear down they may be a bit big width way.I got the pink and it is more toward orchid or liliac than what the photo looks like, just so you know.For the price they are very much worth the money. It's hard to get 12's that are cute and comfy. Even if these don't last for years and years for the sale I got them it is worth it.The memory foam bottoms are an added bonus!"
4,Slippers,The Slippers International women's genuine shearling fluff scuff slippers are terrificSlippers International Women's Fluff Scuff Slipper. They are so comfortable and the fluff doesn't come off like other brands. My feet are always cold and these slippers keep them warm. I also like that I can use them to walk outside or in the garage.I would recommend them to anyone and the price is really good.
3,Wouldn't highly recommend...,"These slippers are not as comfortable as I had expected. They are loose fitting on my feet and don't stay on the best. The sole is hard on the bottom which makes them less comfortable as well. If I had tried them on in a store, I would have passed on them."
3,comfortable slippers,"These slippers are extremely comfortable and warm. The one draw back is that even though I have a wide foot, these slippers are still a little wide. As long as you are not climbing stairs all day they are great!"
4,Warm and fuzzy,"These slippers are very warm and are great for wearing outside as well. The soles are made out of thick rubber and have good traction if you need to run outside for something. They run a little small, so I would order a size up."
3,Soft but not very durable,These are very soft & I love the thick rubber bottoms so I can go outside with them but the heel of the shoe started ripping up not long after I had them. Well the fur started coming off that part. Which I would think with normal wear & tear it would do that but not right when I first got them. I still wear them but am a little disappointed with the quality.
3,Tamarac Slippers,"Really warm, and really comfy! But I've stubbed my right toe TWICE and now the bottom is starting to come off. CHEAP."
2,Wish I had read a review before ordering online,"I wear a slim in women's shoes, so was delighted when I found these in a catalogue. But while they are narrow enough, there is way too much space vertically in these, so as one reviewer said, they feel like flippers when walking. I easily could put on two to three pairs of heavy woolen socks to get a snugger fit. What on earth were the manufacturers thinking? Even with high arches, these fit poorly. Also, buy down a size. I'm an 8 and a half but bought an 8; they still are longish."
4,Fluffy Slippers,"I love these slippers. I have bought them from other stores in the past, but these are of a beter quality. I especially like the thick bottom which is perfect for going outside with them."
4,Comfy Slips!,"Run a bit small. Totally cush! It's like walking in a really yummy hug- like pancake...flat...really flat, but still snuggly."
3,Not much about ancient Rome,"This is NOT a historical overview of Roman history, as one might think from the title. It is a quasi-philosophical collection of vignettes about a few times, persons, and events in Roman history. It reminded me of a taxi ride through Rome, with a driver pointing out interesting historical tidbits about various places while passing by. Not a bad writer, but a generally personal vision of Rome and some of its history."
3,not as good as the older stuff,"I usually don;t listen to a lot of punk rock. But a friend turned me on to Tsunami Bomb and we saw 'em live at this little dive bar near me. I became a fan, and i think that the lead singer Agent M is totally sweet.Anyhow, i was excited as hell when I found this album. But as I listened to it, I didn't get into it as much. Something about the earlier ones was really catchy, sing along stuff..this album doesn;t have as much of that. It's still good, and I do really like the song 'Being Alright' (which is real positive), but the rest just felt less polished or structured to me. I still recommend it for punk fans, tho."
5,Tsunami B,"I couldn't wait for the release of this CD; I saw Tsunami Bomb in concert a few months ago and they were mind-blowing amazing! The club was ultra small and they were just mingling among 'us little people' Anyway, amazing show; they played 2 songs from this up until then unreleased CD; My Machete and Negative One to Ten. I knew; right then and there; I needed the CD asap. Finally the day arrived; I went out and bought it and again are mesmerized. It is such a beatiful, smooth work of art. The lyrics are so good; it's overwhelming. The melodies/the ins/the outs. M and Gabe and Matt and Mike have just put down in history an exquisite treat. Gotta share my faves: A Lonely Chord (heartaching-ly good) Tetanus Shot, Epic, Dawn on a Funeral Day...actually the whole CD, I like!!"
4,Awesome - as expected,"While this new album is not as good as the other two, expect to hear more of M's awesome vocals, Mike's raw guitar, Gabe's fantastic drumming, and Jay's debut album with the band. The album does not seem to have as much drive and ambition as its predecessors, its still fun to rock out to."
1,"Too much ""angry feminist"" mentality","The first chapters warp feeble minded or vulnerable women with its ""victim"" stance. Want to be an angry feminist? Then read this book, otherwise pass it by. The good information it contains can be found elsewhere."
1,Can I give less than 1 star?,There is NOTHING of use here. This woman authoritatively tells others what they should do with their bodies and in their families and with their children. She regularly ignores cultural traditions and preferences.
3,"Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom: Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing",I didn't find much new in this book but found the informationcorrect. It is good for answers to your health questions.
4,Very enlightening.,"A good eye opener to many issues. I have been following nutritional and alternative techniques outlined in The Secrets of Staying Young book, especially an herb that keeps Russians alive to 120. Coupled with information presented in your title, I expect to be healthy until that age and maybe beyond."
1,Dangerously Misinformed,"This doctor (and never has the title been applied so liberally) claims that the withdrawal method is 96% effective at preventing pregnancy, has an entire chapter explaining how to use the rhythm method (all the widely loudly protesting that it isn't the rhythm method), and equates male circumcision with state sponsored sexual abuse. She also references Dr. Laura Berman, the former champion of ""Female Sexual Dysfunction."" This disorder has now been widely debunked as a drug biz marketing tool. When a medical professional openly sponsors this kind of falsehood and nonsense, and references other doctors who make a living spouting falsehood and nonsense, how are we to trust anything she says? I would highly recommend leaving this one in the warehouse and finding some literature you can trust."
2,Bias Was Off-Putting,"Dr. Northrup provides women with practical information about their bodies, stages of life and medical procedures. However, I was appalled by her bias against Western cultural heritage and Christianity. Her views on those topics were extremely unbalanced, with no acknowledgement of their positive contributions to culture and women. As a Catholic whose best teachers were strong-minded, compassionate religious sisters, I felt offended by her slur against nuns. I am aware that not everyone feels the same way about their religious upbringing, but I would expect an academic to strive for some balance in their research."
5,worth every penny,"This book was worth every penny of its cost, for me. I was suffering from severe, debilitating irritable bowel syndrome. I noted one sentence in this book, that food allergies can be the cause of this painful condition. I mentioned the fact to my allergist, I was tested for a wheat allergy, and the IBS was subsequently reduced to rare and negligible occurences. It changed my life!"
3,Read with a certain amount of skepticism,"First of all, Dr. Northrup does a splendid job dealing with many topics beyond the traditional medical model viewpoint with which we Westerners have grown up. Her personal anecdotes also lend the book a great deal of charm. However, at times I felt some of her explanations were a bit too facile, especially her chapter on infertility. As an infertile woman myself, I might have taken her advice to heart and browbeaten myself over what she insists are my dependent personality, ambivalence about motherhood or poor relationship with my husband (common denominators of infertile women, she claims, but not really applicable to me). Instead I got a medical workup and found the *real* cause of my miscarriages: a uterine septum. I'm quite sure my mindset had nothing to do with causing that. As I said, she does a splendid job, but leaves a few things lacking."
1,read between the lines,"There is such an angry,blaming tone to this book I can't believe women buy it.Sure theres info and facts that are helpful but this whole notion of bringing our health problems on by being flawed is just a marketing gimmick:you brought this on because you don't know how to (insert problem here)but buy my books and attend my workshops and you will be cured.Worse still anyone critical of her ideas is instantly labeled as unwilling to look at themselves,rather than able to see right through this charlatan.SPECIAL NOTE:if your problems relate to infertility or miscarriage run away from this book as fast as you can!"
5,Wisdom of Multiple Viewpoints,"Christiane Northrup does an excellent job of sharing traditional and nontraditional information about women's health. Often times text are in favor of one or the other, but she presents the information in way that empowers the reader to decide which is best for them."
1,Insulting to women,"I received this book when I was a teenager and remember sort of digging it. I recently decided to read it again and, now that I have some life experience, I am DISGUSTED. According to the author, my infertility is probably the result of: (a) being ambivalent about parenthood and/or wanting it too much; (b) working outside of the home; (c) having a poor relationship with my husband; or (d) bad vibes I picked up from my mom while in utero -- which she probably inherited from my grandma. How are any of these claims empowering to women??? When she's not citing studies conducted in the 1920s and 1930s, all this author does is reinforce the stereotype that infertile women are cold, sexless workaholics who bring it on themselves. And that is not how I define feminism."
1,Inaccurate on ME,Northrup says depression is a cause of ME/CFIDS. This has been proven false in the scientific literature. Needs to better research.
1,Redundant,The author seems to blow out a lot of hot air. I tried reading the book in its entirety but couldn't do it. I realized everything I learned half way through would have taken me a 10 minute search on the web. Save your money and do your own specific research online. I would never recommend this book to any woman. Maybe a man yes for a good introductory course on womanhood.
1,"Northrup, Move Over!","Because there are REAL women's literary health guides out there. I personally suggest Our Bodies, Ourselves from the Boston Women's Health Collective. Instead of shoving unfounded, bias, and conservative information down your throat like Northrup does, it clearly explains issues pertaining to any woman of any age or background. I have extreme remorse for any woman turning to this book for tolerance and understanding concerning our bodies, minds or choices (especially the choice to have an abortion). I feel like work does nothing but spread harmful, untrue information instead of the facts. Northrup's ""wisdom"" is best kept inside her head."
5,"I buy this book for so many women I know and are searching for some answers, both physical and emotional","This book has helped me understand so much of what emotional and physical problems I have encountered in my life. I have bought this book as a gift for at least 5 of my friends,all of whom have shared with me how much it has helped them understand what there bodies often having been telling them and now they understand how to listen. She is an easy to understand writer and understands women. It is also a book I would recomend for men to read also."
1,"appeared promising, but disappointing","As a feminist scholar, I was excited to read this book, especially given that it appeared to have a strong focus on holistic women's health. However, I just could not get myself to continue after she seriously introduced the idea of chakras and energy field/forces. How disappointing to see a medical doctor wander off into an completely unproven and pseudoscientific realm. Discussions of women's health and a holistic approach do not mean uncritically accepting any ""spiritual"" claims. If these therapies do work, they can probably be explained through promoting psychological wellbeing, or through the placebo effect(which is not necesarily a bad thing if it helps a person feel better). However, given her uncritical acceptance of what is a marginal philosophy at best, I could not trust any of the other information presented. I didn't know if the medical information had been researched/validated at all, or if it merely ""sounded good."""
5,Dr Northrup Book,"Wonderful, useful information. I have used this book for years and buy every updated version. Dr. Northrup provides an encyclopedia of information on women's issues."
2,"Women's Bodies, Freudian Wisdom","This woman is Freud with a shwancy haircut (did Freud have hair?) Every problem, every itch, every bump is because of a repressed emotion. According to Dr. Northrup,a womsn can fall sick because of:1) She dyed her hair green by accident, and didnt take the time off to grieve about it.2) She forgot to tell her husbands how much she hated him.3) She fears the unknown and hence get constipated, and hence experienced hairloss, and hence developed breastcancer, and hence...Okay, you get the picture"
1,not sure what new knowledge this brings,"Haven't found anything extremely interesting in this book. perhaps a nice read, but not worth the money actually buying it."
4,"Really pleased with the service,",I havent read the book because I ordered it as a gift. But I can tell you that the service involved in getting it was excellent . The book was in very good condition and the time in getting it was great.. I really appreciate the e mails that follow up every order procedure as it happens.
5,Life-changing information,"This book has taught me so much! Dr. Northrup has a wonderful way of thoroughly presenting information regarding women's health issues. The stories of her patients are very inspiring. Now that I've read the book completely, I often open it up randomly and start reading sections again - I learn something every time."
3,not what i had hoped for,"The book ""Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom"" was a depressing read for me. I didn't wish to continue reading most of it because it was very disheartening. I was hoping for a much more positive, up-beat book rather than a plight of the female condition.Some of the book was insightful and meaningful but it wasn't the holistic, loving perspective I thought it would be. It was more of a ""Watch out or you could end up dealing with this <disease>!""I truly believe in the emotional tie between body and mind but also in general health practices for good body care.Read this book ""with a grain of salt"" , maybe it's meaning will be different for you."
3,Packed with information... a bit much in the self-help area,"If you can get past the idea that your ills can be cured if you ""fix your emotional turmoil"" this is a pretty good book. It's just that you had better be ready to dismantle and rebuild if you are going to take all of this ""self-awareness"" to heart. I found myself getting depressed... so I quit reading the book. But, I do keep it handy for reference."
3,abreso,"Thank you for the purchase - a little more worn than expected - older version but, useful... again thank you"
2,Our Bodies; Ourselves is better!,"A friend gave me this book shortly after I was diagnosed with endometriosis, thinking it would be helpful. She was mistaken.Dr Northrup apparantly thinks that my endometriosis results from my difficulty in accepting/understanding my role as a woman, or some unprocessed sexual abuse, or some other new-age, victim-mentality psychobabble.Little actual, relevent medical information appears in this book. Some of the herbal and natural remedies are useful, but this is *not* a good reference if you have any condition more serious than premenstrual bloating.For years, I was told that the extreme misery I suffered (due to my endo) was in my head. I find it very hurtful that a self-identified feminist physician would perpetuate a variation of that myth.Buy ""Our Bodies; Ourselves"" by the Boston Women's Health Collective instead."
1,Misguided Wisdom,"This book does highlight some important issues in women's health care. However, as someone whose first born child was stillborn this past summer, I was extremely put off by the sections in the book that deal with pregnancy loss and infertility. The idea that miscarriages,""poor pregnancy outcomes,"" and infertility is the result of maternal ambivalence and communicating maternal stress (which is vaguely described in the book as emotional stress and conflicts about motherhood) is complete hogwash and harmful to those women and men who are suffering and grieving. People in these situations are already trying to come to terms with sorrowful circumstances and do not need to be told that they were to blame. Readers beware!"
1,Avoid if you're researching infertility,"If you are dealing with infertility, do *not* buy this book. The opening line of the section on infertility basically says if you can't get pregnant then, deep down, you probably don't want to get pregnant.Hello? This is awful, painful advice for someone who's been trying for years to have a child.I threw the book away -- this section undermined any confidence I might have in the rest of the book.I can't even watch this woman on PBS anymore."
1,It is meant only for the women.,"I could see this book being good if you are a women, but it really doesn't help men much. Unless you prefer the alternate lifestyle I would recomend this book only for the women. Mabey the author should write a book ""Mens Body Mens Wisdom"""
1,Disappointed,"I am sorry I could never read a book about women's health issues by a doctor who has performed abortions. Whereis that helping women. Abortion is destroying womens lives as well as birth control. Our country is giving birth control to our daughters in junior high to help with their periods. There is something fundamentally wrong with this. Is this the future of women? I suggest to every woman to real John Paul II's book, ""THEOLOGY OF THE BODY"".When women and men respect their bodies they will find much more happiness and healing in their lives."
1,This book is hogwash,"I am writing to tell women.. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. It is a waste of money. Ms. Northrup surely is an embarrassment to the female race. A medical doctor? NOT!! I was particularly disturbed by the statement on pre-ecampsia in pregnancy a result of the ""hypochondriac pregnant patient"" PLEASE!! Give me a break already. I am as positive as a woman gets and I got pre-eclampsia and NO I am NOT a hypochondriac and NO I wasn't mentally pushing my baby out of my womb early because I didn't want to be pregnant anymore. GIVE ME A BREAK This book should not be on the book shelves. Spare us please. Women are MORE INTELLEGENT than this book portrays us to be..Let's get on with REALITY. !!!!"
5,The best book I have ever read on women's health,"I was given the English edition of this book and I think it is brilliant. Christiane Northrup is obviously a very special healer. In this book she demonstrates how our emotions affect our physical health. She shows us that if we look at ourselves and what is going on in our lives we can often see the relationship between our emotions and our physical illness. She is also very strong on healing and what we can do for ourselves on every level, orthodox and by thinking about our illness in a different way. I have given this book to so many women and all of them recommend it to others. It is a book for life and it is good to have a version adapted for England. The publisher is Piatkus if anyone wants to know."
2,Good Information,"Some good information from Dr. Northrup but some of it has been said before too many times. I would recommend Saudra Pelletier's ""Awake at the Wheel"" to inspire you for work/life balance as well.Saddle Up Your Own White Horse: 5 Principles Every Woman Needs to Know"
5,A MUST READ FOR ALL WMEN!,"NO matter who you are - professional or not professional - you should read this book by Dr. Northrup! You should use the wisdom and knowledge gained from this book to, not only help yourself be healthy, but to raise your children in a healthy lifestyle!"
2,not great,"I wish I bought the book. For all the talking on the CD's there are only a few bits that are helpful. It's different parts of different lectures, it's not the reading of the book."
5,"This book will save your life, when you're ready.","This is a book that focusses on healing your body, not curing your disease. It is a difficult concept at first, especially if you are still hoping that your doctors are going to ""cure"" you. When I first bought the book, I looked up specific ailments and was disapointed with the lack of simple answers. Three years later I realize that this is its gift.Ms. Northrup provides a clear explanation of each field of our bodies and the emotions they relate to. She believes that digging down and facing these emotions is the only way to free our bodies to heal themselves. The book provides countless case histories that prove this point gently, holding a mirror to our own lives to help us see more clearly. The final chapters of the book present a 12-step program for healing, one day at a time.I highly recommend this book for every woman of child-bearing age, and for every mother who wants to raise a secure and healthy daughter."
5,"Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom book review",Excellent resource for any woman who wishes to learn more about her body and how to heal it from the inside out.
5,For Women Serious About Their Health,"This book belongs in the library of every woman ready to take back control of her health. Northrup's alternative viewpoint is a breath of fresh air in a system clogged with disempowerment and controls -- insurance restrictions, pharmaceutical control, medical mistakes, and the worst health care system in the top 30 developed nations. Dr. Kris"
5,"Helpful, insightful book","I am really enjoying this book. It's been great in terms of helping me to re-think the way I feel about my body as a woman and it offers some wonderful advice on how I might be able to help my daughter do the same. If you're experiencing hormonal issues, mood swings, and other things you like to make peace with and/or gain more control over, this book offers some very helpful advice."
1,For Crying Out Loud!,"I am a resonable and open minded person,but I think this book is just plain weird. ""How to Heal Energy Leaks"", and ""How to Heal Lower-Chakra Wounding""... I realize that there is good information mixed in with this, but I just can't take it seriously. Truthfully, I quit after page 255. Elaine (a patient) is experiencing long term pain. She suddenly experiences an in utero memory of feeling her father's penis poking her through her mother's uterus. Elaine is sure she experienced her mother's disgust and indifference during sex and was victimized by it, thus causing all of her problems. Come on,that's just too much!"
2,I was frankly disappointed in this book.,"I know I'm in the minority, but I was very disappointed in this book, and wasn't surprised to see Doctor- gurus like Deepak Chopra and Bernie Siegel heartily recommending it. Dr. Northrup seems to mesh gynelogical information with a lot of New Age philosophy. You are what you eat, you got fibroids because your mindset's wrong, and you can't get pregnant because you don't really want to. She also has good things to say for Shamans, members of Wicca, and Tarot cards. In short, I really don't think I'd consult this woman if I needed to see a gynecologist."
5,"Women's bodies, women's wisdom","The best book I ever read! It is so insightful; every time i pick it up i learn something new about myself. Not only has it taught me more about how my body functions, but also how to read the signs my body gives me. It has helped me deal with my past, live my life in a fullfilling way now, and ensure a healthy future. I recommend it for all women who are looking to live a healthy life daily ( emotionally and physically ), and who want to know themselves more intimatly."
5,always find something enlightening within the pages,"Womens, wisdom is written in lay terms with references on med. facts to look into later.This was origninally given to my daughter in 1999."
2,Disappointed - little help if loved on is still in prison.,I thought this book would be helpful in dealing with someone you love that is CURRENTLY in prison. There is a wee bit of info dealing with that aspect but most is how to deal with someone that is an ex-convict.
5,Thank you,"LAmp was delivered timely, packed well, and looks just like the picture. The finishing touch to my bedroon decor. I would use this seller again"
4,Horses on the Range touch lamp,"The lamp was fine except it had one broken panel, probably happened during shipping. Although the company was taking care of the problem, they never notified me that they were. I contacted Amazon and then the company e-mailed me a rude note that they got my message. They still didn't tell me what they were going to do to rectify the situation. Finally, about a week later I received a new panel in the mail. They did take care of the problem but they were very rude."
2,uuhh a 12 year old can do better,"i wish i had sampled it before i got it. its childlike. it has unneccessary laser blasts and blips that make mecco seem like a beethoven symphony. you want star wars dance stick to dezrok that has all the passion,intensity this cd wishs it had!"
3,Mediocre at best,"The ATM Imperial Mix is a synthesizer-version of the theme, with some DJ scratching and a drum beat thrown in. How many times have you heard this song? This is the kind of song only John Williams' orchestra can do justice to. It ain't no pop song."
5,The Essential Judy Moment,"You must see this doc for one reason - the very end. The very last song is Judy singing Over the Rainbow dressed as a tramp in her 1955 special. The picture has a harsh contrast and is a bit grainy, and Judy's voice is rough from emotion and strain, but none of that matters. She stops being Judy, the starved movie star and becomes Judy, aching soul of humanity. Every time I watch it I get goosebumps. The preceeding 90 minutes isn't bad and in fact its flaws - over-sentimental narration by Lorna Luft, white-washing Sid Luft's faults, heavy reliance on footage from the Judy Garland Show - kind of heighten the final effect. There are lots of great moments; 'Old Man River' and 'The Man that Got Away' are stand outs, also the first known footage of the Gumm Sisters and short bootleg filmclips of Judy at Carnegie Hall. This one is a great compilation to have."
5,Great DVD and voice;,"What a great DVD. It is a little long, but never boring;The singing is awesome; I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
3,Good for coloring practice...,This is the second book I have done from this autor...pretty simple designs with few exceptions though...I guess every autor has its own settled designing style...I am not sure I would by a third book from this autor...
4,color book,Made the perfect gift for my coloring crazy niece who had never seen anything like this before.
5,A Perfect Reference Guide for Travelers,"My family and are planning a vacation to visit the Hamptons area later this summer. I picked this book up with the hope that it would give us a good basic historical overview about the area. It turns out this book is so much more than a standard history. The vintage photos that were collected for this book are so vivid they literally reach out and ""touch"" you and send your mind reeling backwards in time - a time that is seemingly ""lost"" as the author refers to in the title of the book.This book will now be a companion guide for me and my family during our trip. We plan to seek out as many of the places pictured in the book and find out what they look like now so we can build a ""before and after"" album of our trip."
5,hampton hamsters!,"I lost my two pet hamsters, hampton and hampton. I thought this book would help me find them. It didn't, but the pictures were so pretty, I don't care about my hamsters any more."
1,Terrible Packaging and Missing Hardware,"I totally agree with and echo the comments of the previous reviewer almost verbatim. After a six week wait, the item arrived in badly torn packaging with the provided hardware falling about loosely in the box. I was not as fortunate in that almost half the mounting hardware was lost. As a result I was able to mount only one of the guides so far. The white uprights were badly scuffed and had black marks all over."
3,Good for backing up a small trailer,"I bought this to help see my small boat trailer when trying to land my boat. Without these I could not see my trailer either from the rear view mirror or side mirrors. dropping the tailgate was not possible due lack of room. The guides were easy to install and work well. My only complaint is I was missing a vinyl cap for one of the guides. The directions included show a different installation picture than the one on the box, but it's no big deal."
2,"Good, but missing parts!","Just received this and decided to put it on the trailer. The box was in rough condition and someone had taped up one side of an end. That should have prepared me. When I tilted the box, the posts and mounting frames came out and then an empty cardboard parts holder. Someone had ripped open the plastic wrap. I gently tilted the box further and the nuts, washers and screws came out. Unfortunately, only half the nuts were there and 3 lock washers were missing.This means I have to go to home depot and try to match up the nuts and washers. This is more of an inconvenience than a cost or product misfunction. But somebody packed it that way and it was pure laziness and poor business practice. I wouldn't purchase from them again most likely. Too bad, because the item looked to be of decent quality."
4,Works well,"Works well, boat glides into the guides easily and makes it much, much easier to get the boat on the trailer now."
5,Great product,I had this product on my first boat and bought it here for my second one. Great price easy to install and gives you great visibility when backing into the water.
2,this is a long winded book that could be 200 pages shorter.,"This book is required by several Women's Studies classes around the country. I feel it is too wordy and hard for many students in undergraduate programs to understand. The main issues in the book are hidden behind a large academic language that not all students understand. The points made in the book though, are valid ones."
4,great collection,gold jewel collection on the amazing judy garland. worth to get it!!! the duos are specially noteworthy. Judy and her kids singing are a rarity.
5,FUN FUN FUN,"Robert Rodi's KEPT BOY is a fun novel to read. This is a book one could read before bed. The story is funny, the characters are interesting, and the read is easy. The ending is a tad perdictable, but who cares. It's hard to believe that this book is Rodi's lastest (which came out about around 1998). I hope Mr. Rodi would come out with a new novel soon enough."
5,The description of the grief pit is excellent!,"I've been a bereavement counselor for many years. As usual I'm always looking for a book to share with my patients. I've finally found one that is true to the grief experience. You offer dozens of helpful tips and easy to follow ways to improve your life and take as you mention often an ""active role"" in grief. I am highly recommending your book. It is easy to understand and it really helps!"
2,okay,Not the greatest movie that I saw but then again it's a low budget soft porn flick that isn't that bad for what it is.
5,Green Day back at the top,"This was there first single for a while, but it was worth the wait. The b-sides also rock, look out for ""Espionage"" which has now appeared in a certain spy film..."
4,Satisfied Customer,I bought this book for a grandchild who loves to draw. This is a very easy to learn book and she loved it. Illustrations on all Ed Emberly's books are easy to understand for all age levels.
3,Pretty complex,"I bought this book for my 9 year old step-daughter. She loves art and drawing. I also got the Ed Emberley book of animals, which is great. This book seems cluttered and the drawings are much more difficult. The reading level says 9-12, but I'd say its the upper end of that range."
1,Never Had Such Trouble,"I ordered the download version. After at least 20 attempts at downloading and installing, and repeated suggestions from Imaginova's cutomer service, I finally gave up!"
2,"Bought sight-unseen, disappointed","This was an Amazon recommendation based upon my past purchases of Buckethead and Joe Satriani. While Keneally is clearly a gifted guitarist, this album tends towards Zappa a bit too much for my liking. Don't get me wrong, I like Zappa, but this album just wasn't my cup of tea."
1,Brilliant. But really hard to listen to.,"Mike Keneally's music is like an experimental movie with no beggining, middle, end. He's managed to incorporate Todd Rundgren, Brian Wilson and the other songwriting giants into a unique ""non-style"" that's jumpy, irritating and, well, not very musical. A shame for such a fine guitarist with such great recording technique. Somewhere in here are some fabulous songs--hits, even--but I doubt Mike will ever lower himself to that.So who gives it 5 stars? People who prefer novelty and cleverness to catchiness, I guess. Zappa fans. Home recording enthusiasts, maybe. This is the kind of stuff that critics, bored with listening to the same old thing, just love. If Leonard Bernstein was alive, he'd go nuts for this."
3,"Thoughtful & heartfelt, but indirect & arcane in his prose","The practice of medicine holds special fascination for me, a longtime practitioner myself. This work reveals a depth of feeling and a revelation of the human soul that is often overlooked in such an important profession as neurosurgery; still, Dr. Flitter's writing at times is difficult to stay with, and he sometimes wanders unneccessarily. However, writing from the heart as he does is honest and difficult, and for that I applaud his work. I would recommend his book to others in the healthcare field."
1,CPR,"ONE DAY DOWNLOADING VIDEOS FROM THE WEB I FOUND A VIDEO WICH IS CALLED ""I WISH"" AND TO MY SURPRISE THE GUEST VOCALS ON THAT VIDEO WAS ZAKK WYLDE FROM BLACK LABEL SOCIETY... I GOT TO SAY THAT THE MUSIC IS KINDA COOL.... BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW'S THE ENTIRE RECORD...."
4,A comprehensive inroduction,"This book is great if you are new to home theater, and is also useful if you have not kept up with the latest (as of 2003). I also own ""Home Theater for Everyone"" but I prefer the Dummies book for 2 reason: it is more comprehensive, covering different subjects with proportional weight and (2) Home theater for Every One is somewhat outdated, especially when it comes to home theater PC or HTPC, and therefore isn't very helpful in those departments. What I did not like was the depth of the subjects, or more precisely the lack of it. For example, I wanted to know about subwoofer setup options, but there were none other than the simplest LFE line connection. After writing a whole book on the subject you would think they would write in more depth. However, overall, this book was good for starter home theater owners."
4,I love it!,"My mother-in-law brought this toy for my daughter and I love it for her. She's going to be 4 in a month and it's helping me teach her shapes. The moon shape is the only shape she had a real problem with putting together, but everything else she could do. We ended up playing memory with it by turning over the halves and picking at random. I like it because it's a fun toy for her while exposing her to shapes she wouldn't normally see. The extra appeal to her was that it was in the shape of cookies (something she's very familiar with). I love this toy and highly recommend it!"
4,Small World is full of oldies and goodies,"It's A Small World of Fun is a delightful collection of Disney short films, none of which ever made acclaim in their day, but which today's viewer should find quaint and refreshing. THE BRAVE LITTLE TAILOR pits Mickey against the somewhat inept giant after he kills seven flies in one blow, PETER AND THE WOLF gives orchestral accompaniment to the narration, THE OLYMPIC CHAMP has Goofy demonstrating various Olympic events as only he can, CRAZY WITH HEAT has Goofy paired with Donald Duck as the two get themselves out of the desert, and SUSIE, THE LITTLE BLUE COUPE follows the life and exploits of an anthropomorphized automobile, while PEDRO does the same for a small South American aircraft. Relive the time when cartoons were entertaining without being gory or sensational."
3,"Fine, but somewhat unfair","Certainly an engrossing book.However, Feinstein's Duke bias is all-too apparent.The most glaring example comes when he spends nearly a chapter on the Duke-North Carolina game played in Cameron Indoor Stadium (which Duke won), but in the rematch at the Smith Center (which UNC won), he only writes a paragraph. There are also several factual errors in the book - although I'm sure that in the rush to meet deadlines, there wasn't enough time for editing. Feinstein spins a good yarn, but his propensity for revealing his biases wears thin on those of us who don't share his preferences."
5,"Great for any basketball fan, a must-read for ACC fans.","I bought this book as a Christmas present for my husband, but unwrapped it twice to sneak in a few chapters myself because I couldn't wait. Feinstein spent last season in an ACC fan's dream, with great access to games, coaches and locker rooms. I enjoyed the background material on each coach, and found myself reliving games through his descriptions. There are numerous humorous anecdotes, many of which I'm hearing again as filler commentary during this year's games. I have to admit that Feinstein does show a slight preference for Duke, his alma mater -- mine too, so I didn't mind but even I noticed.The end result is, thanks to Mr. Feinstein, I'm watching EVERY ACC basketball game this year (in the past I'd watch for my school and my husband's, and check other scores for standings). Not only that, because I liked Rick Barnes so much in the book, I have actually cheered for Clemson for the first time in my life."
3,"If you love Duke basketball, you'll love this book","I love the author's previous work, and even in this book he offers insight that i think few others would be able to capture as well. However, Feinstein spends way too much time in certain areas (with the people he obviously likes), specifically the Duke Blue Devils. For some reason, the Dookies, despite a not-so-hot year, get a lot of attention in this book. The book also fails to capture the rivalries that exist outside of Duke/North Carolina or Carolina/N.C. State."
5,A must read for college basketball fans,"Any fan of college basketball, especially of the ACC, will love this book. Feinstein sure picked a great season to chronicle the ACC, made more so by Dean Smith's retirement after one of his best coaching jobs."
5,Terrific look at the ACC,"No true college hoops should be without this book. Feinstein does another terrific job of showing the reader inside basketball. Thanks to the cooperation of the ACC coaches and players, the season becomes meaningful to the reader. AN enjoyable read. I would say something negative, but there was nothing bad about the book."
2,Not good for toe stands,"I bought these shoes for my daughter but didn't realize that these tap shoes don't work at all for toe stands. There is pretty much no support, and the tip of the shoe is already almost completely busted through, and have only had them a month! Waste of money in my case."
3,"Seem nice, don't fit my foot shape","Just an FYI out there for women with a narrow heel and wide ball of the foot (if your heel slips out of those stylish ballet flats, I'm probably talking to you). You spend a lot of time on your toes/balls of your feet tap dancing, and my heels would have forever been sliding in and out of the shoes - the laces don't go up high enough for my kind of foot, even though the fit around the ball of my foot was slightly tight.That said, the leather was flexible and soft, and the taps were good quality, so I am bummed that I had to return them."
5,Great shoe - get dancing,"I ordered 1/2 size larger and they fit perfect. Well made, light weight. Makes tap dancing easy. So get dancing!"
4,Really excellent knives,"Given the bargain price for this set, I think the knives are beautiful and super sharp. That shape of the handle was the huge attraction for me. You can't go wrong."
1,great at first,"I have had these knives for almost a year now and when I first got them they were great. Very sharp out of the box and would cut pretty much anything ease. I took very good care of them, never let them sit in water and I would dry them right after I washed them, never let any fruit juices sit on the blade. Now almost a year later, the blades on 3 of the knives have started to chip and break. I am not happy and will be getting rid of them. Wustohf here I come!"
2,Nice at first but rusts away very easy,"Bought this knife set 3 months ago. It was beautiful with unique patterns on the blade and very sharp. But within few days we noticed it rusts very quickly. We left a knife in the sink in the morning after breakfast, by the time we came home for dinner the knife had several rust spots. We had to use Barkeeper's friend to clean all the rust out. We've tried to clean and dry the knives immediatly after every use - real pain in the #*@ - but once in a while one will be forgotten for couple hours and then rust immediatly forms. Once, when someone else was helping clean up, one went into the dishwasher. It didn't only have rust all over but the blade edge rusted away! Now the knife has jagged edge!!! I guess if I grind down the knife about 1mm I'll have a full edge again but I didn't expect this from top-of-the-line knives. Will not buy this brand of knives anymore."
5,A Steel!,Found these on line and purchased for my wife who runs a home based daycare and cooks for 12-14 kids daily. She has never had the privilege of using nice cutlery and would probably not spend the money on something like this for herself. She frowned at me when she found out what they cost and wanted me to return them. I insisted that she give them a try and was just as pleasantly surprised as she was. The handles are very comfortable and allow for a variety of holding positions. The Damascus style blade is beautiful. The only word of caution I can offer is that you wash and dry the blades immediately as the blades will stain if not attended to promptly. We have been using these for almost a year now and are just as pleased with their performance today as we were the first day.
4,good knives for the money,"these are very good for the money 4.5 stars.pros: good steel. thin blades, epoxy resin handles, balanced, stay sharp, they bend instead of breaking. they look good, they should last forevercons: due to the type of steel that these are made of, they aren't rust proof, u must dry them after use. They are so sharp u must be extremely careful not to cut ur fingers offI strop my knives with polishing compound, and if u do this too, you could split atoms with these knives; they stay razor sharp with stropping."
4,excellent,I found this knife set to contain the sharpest knives out of the box of any knives that I have ever bought. They hold an edge well and have a good balance. The integrated bolster adds to the controllability of the knives. The only problem with the set is the steel hone. I find it is too course to be used except on the dullest knife. That is the only detractor from the set.
4,Love them!,"I would disagree with the previous review. I loved these knives! My wife even uses them and says how easy to hold they are. The bolster design work perfect for holding a knife the correct way up at the top of the bolster where the blade begins. If you hold them by ""pinching"" there and letting the handle rest in your hand it's very comfortable.They seem very well balanced.The design of the layers of steel looks great. They really give a destinct look to these knives.I'll be buying more of this set."
4,Great Knives for the kitchen,"You need to take care of the blades. Soap clean and wipe them dry and they have no problems and will give you years of excellent service. They are very beautiful. I have been using them for two years and I love the knives. Bought a blcok with eight and filled in over time off of the ebay, those that I wanted or thought I should have. It did not come to that much money. People say they don't compare to Shun, and I don't know if that is true, but they surely do not cost like Shun either. And they are more beautiful. Feel great in the hand, and cut extremely finely. I find them easy to maintain; it becomes a habit to care for them rather than plunk them in the sink. Two swipes of the steel and they are razor sharp. Maybe you will have some who will not find them worthy, but isn't that always the case?"
4,Indie Pop at its Purest,"I liked it a whole lot. I heard a song of theirs on a station here at school. Luckily the DJ mentioned the track and name of the band. Imagine my suprise to see that they had their CD here! Usually bands like this disappear into obscurity. I quickly ordered the cd. All I can say is that I can't stop listening to it. I reminds me a lot of later day pavement but with a sense of honest and depth that I find lacking in today's world of Korns and the Backstreet Boys. I see that they have another CD which I will order once I am finished here. I like the mix of disonant guitars and vintage keyboard tinkerings. There is even a eloquently sad acoustic song that reminds me a lot of Guided by Voices finer moments. So if you are into looking for something that is an alternative to the alternative, pick up this diamond in the rough."
5,Great for my MEC Press,"I have been loading shotshells for about a year now, so I doing various loads and this 1 3/8 expanded my ability to load shellA+++ good to work with"
5,Best price I could find for these,Makes a great spare tire lock for under a truck. Put a piece of electrical tape over the key hole just in case. Prompt shipping and a good value.
2,Comes apart - awkward,"I imagine it's really strong, so I can't complain too much.However, when you unlock it, it comes apart into 2 pieces. This is a real pain when you're wrestling with the stiff chain. You need 3 hands to easily lock your bike. I would NOT buy this model again.Get one that doesn't come apart - make your life a little easier."
4,For securing secondary cables to your frame.,"Less expensive than larger U-Locks ... Not likely anyone will be able to pry this small diameter bend open. I already own a ~$20 (thick) combination locked cable and this lock, in conjunction with an secondary security cable will help me to acheive a modicum of redundancy and to tie prized accessories into my frame and a 2nd wheel. Just makes it harder to steal my seat, rear rack and my rear wheel, while my main cable secures my electric front drive hub and front rack. ... each cable (front and rear) are independently locked to the street-rack, post, or other anchor.you can see what it is, in the picture ... It is as big as your entire hand and something like a pound (or more). Same weight and metrics as the larger U-Locks, just a shorter loop ... Just as heavy-duty as a larger U-Lock."
2,Misleading Advertisement,"This product ''Master Lock 8118DPF Vinyl-Covered U-Lock'' is described as yellow body. The information is MISLEADING. I've had a previous experienced with this type of Lock and, the Lock was actually yellow in color. What I got was a BLACK Vinyl covered U-Lock with differently shape key. Different in the sense of my previous experienced. I hope what I got will give me the same kind secured security as my previous. I was extremely satisfied with my previous YELLOW COVERED U-LOCK. Hope this BLACK COVERED U-LOCK will give me same SATISFACTION. If something is advertised as Yellow then, the product should sold and deliver as was advertised."
1,Freaking small!!!!,"It's ridiculously small. This would never fit on a bike, so it shouldn't be on the bikes lock section! I didn't even get angry when I received it, 'cause I could only laugh!"
2,Ok quality,"I bought this only because I wanted a pair of stainless shears. You do need your muscles, though. I am using it to remove the fins from fish. Good luck."
1,Not quite as useful as I thought,I found that the authors examples and stratigies are not those that actually happen in real world environments. If would had been helpful if he could have provided some of his own experiences he deals with on a day to day basis. This book seems to be a cross-refrenece to sew together other books (Oracle and .Net) instead of a best practices and examples.Not very useful of those in an enterprise environment.
3,ADO.NET into for oracle 10g,I would like to have given this book a 5 starsbut the title is greatly over-exagerated for ProsThis is the first time I have accessed oracle for the firsttime thru visual studio and the book has helped me overcomethat fear. The examples are clear and concise in its intoto oracle so even an idiot could pick it up.I would like to see a book which extends more on real life examples. A drawback i would like to add about this book.This book is TOO exepensive for a introductory bookI am thrilled that all the examples do work which was a MAJOR plus.
3,OOP examples are missing,"The book always uses open connection string parameters.That is to say.You have write your user id and password in order to get connected to oracle.This not good for a programmer.But if you write your Connect method in a class.Then revoke this Connect method from this class,it would be better.In the all examples of this book,the programs contains connection string very open.But in a real example you have to hide your connection string.Since connection string contains your oracle database password.If your password changes you have to change all programs.So password changes should be dynamically reflected to the program applications.There is no object oriented example in the book."
2,"Great book, incomplete Kindle version","Kindle edition does not include any of the rich collection of photographs that form a vital part of the book... a fact that is not included anywhere in the information on amazon.com and is not reflected in a reduced price for the incomplete Kindle edition.Where a photograph should be, is the helpful instruction to go look at the print version of the book."
5,Nice Rack,"Exactly what I needed; strong, durable and sturdy.Hangs easily over the doors and good polished finish.Ample space to hang lot of clothes"
5,"An entertaining, educational book for dog lovers of all ages","The author has a way of telling Piper's story that is fun to read by sharing real-life happenings in Piper's world ... some are funny, some are serious. Woven in the adventures are lessons to be learned about caring for our pets and loving them, as well as their love for us. The drawings are simple, yet well-done, and help depict this adorable Scottish Terrier puppy, who has a mind of her own and educates her mom and dad on what they need to learn being owned by a Scottie! I recommend it to all Scottie lovers, and dog lovers in general, young and young at heart."
4,Hilarious Adult comedy!,One of Carl Reiners best! George Segal (Just shoot me) is at his best. Ruth Gordon(Any Which way but loose) steals alot of scenes though as George`s senile mother.This movie is a must see for everyone over the age of 18. I guarantee you`ll hurt yourself laughing.
5,Where's Poppa,This movie was one my brother and sister-in-law kept telling me about. They had a copy and we all watched it together. I enjoyed it so much that I wanted to have a copy for myself.
5,This movie is a classic.,The first time I saw Where's Popa was in the mid seventies. this is the best dark comedy ever written. Ruth Gordon and George Segal at their best. I alway's wanted to own this movie so I can turn people on to it that never saw it. I love the fact that now I own it and can watch it whenever I choose.
3,Where's Poppa,"If you like dark comedy and extreme satire, you will like this movie. If you like fast paced action movies, this is not the one for you. It moves painfully slow at times. I have been told by a reliable source that the book the movie is based upon is a great read."
5,great comedy ruth gordon rules!,A must see. One of many in Nipsey's collection of videos.The central park runs will have you crying on the floor.Take time out of your life to see this flick!So sez Nipsey!
1,Waste of time,"I had heard this was a cult favorite, so I gave it a go. Boy was I sorry. Carl Reiner is no director. This is amateur hour here. Ruth Gordon is OK in small doses, but you get far too much of her in this movie, and she is more obnoxious than usual. George Segal, who was a hot actor in the 1970s, gives the material his best shot, but his efforts aren't worth it, as this is just a great big waste of time. Do yourself a favor and skip this junk."
1,Reiner's bomb,"This is supposed to be a black comedy. In fact, it is an ineptly directed, unfunny, obscene mess. It features filthy language, the required men's bathroom scene, rape, racism, hatred of America, and ridicule of the mentally ill. Attention all Altzheimer's patients, Reiner thinks you're hilarious.Watch Harold and Maude or, even better, Little Murders if you want to see black comedy. This bomb is best forgotten. I'm not selling my DVD copy, I'm throwing it away."
3,NOT BAD BUT NOT SPECIAL,"Yes BRAD can play the guitar, but so can thousands of others. In a band format, this virtuosity might be enough as he doesn't have to carry the whole musical load. As a solo project, this lacks the melodie or originality of composition that makes CD's in this genre special. MICHAEL LEE FIRKINS / ANDY TIMMONS / NEIL ZAZA / MARC BONILLA to name a few, do this kind of thing soooo much better. The compositions on this CD are below average and only the 2 songs featuring GREGG ALLMAN are standout tracks. If the rest of the CD was as good as HONEST TO GOD and IF LOOKS COULD KILL, it would be first class, but all the instrumentals ( the rest of the tracks ) are uninspiring and cliche without any redeeming features. This will certainly be my only BRAD GILLIS CD and I doubt that it will get much play."
5,Yay!,"I read 3 a.m. about a month ago and enjoyed it thoroughly. I think I was up until 3 a.m. reading it, as terribly cliché as it sounds. The humor and the intimacy of the stories really had me hooked. ""A Real Beauty"" was probably my favorite. The reason I started writing was because of my grandfather's unwavering encouragement and support. The bond between grandfather and granddaughter in the story was really sweet, and I could relate to it easily."
1,"if i could give her less than 1 star, i would","I bought this book because a friend recommended it to me. After I read it, I called said friend to tell her we could no longer be friends. All I heard were laughs. When she stopped laughing long enough to breathe, I found out she did so because she was trying to punish me for accidentally killing her parakeet, Lassie. In the spirit of good sportsmanship, I congratulated her on a prank well played.I used to think Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin was the most repulsively sentimental, masturbatory, and self-important work of fiction i would ever be forced to experience. I was wrong. Don't read this. And for God's sake don't buy it. I know this sounds harsh but I really mean it when I say this is worse than Chicken Soup."
3,Certainly not great...,"On the one hand, I feel like I can't complain because of the price. On the other hand, the person who mentioned tinny, annoying treble, was right. Also right about having to adjust the sound for every song. I wanted these for my mp3 player. Not a good choice- and don't plan on playing them loud. They don't just don't go there. If you like to get blasted out of the room with volume, it ain't gonna happen. On loudness capability, I'd rate 'em about a 1. At a moderate volume, I suppose they're acceptable, but not great. I'm tempted to send them back, but for the price I paid, it probably wouldn't be worth it."
4,Very Happy With These Speakers,"I personally love these speakers for my computer. I think they sound great!!! I use them for general computer stuff, listen to music and watch movies. Wonderful! I just wish they had a remote."
2,Sent them right back,Tinny and irritating treble. Bass was okay. Each tune I played required adjustment...though no adjustment would eliminate the high-pitch screechy tone.
5,Great speakers...great price!,THESE ARE THE ONES YOU WANT! - for the price it's an excellent deal. Don't bother with the Creative brand - I did and had to return them. These are just fine on bass and have adjustment dials to modify your Bass and Treble. AWESOME BUY!
4,Works great... bigger than I expected,"This speaker system worked just fine... especially for the price. We bought it to take on a trip with us, and were surprised that it was quite large (the base part). But it does what it's supposed to do."
5,Great deal,"I needed a small speaker system to play my Ipod at the office-this was perfect! Nice sound, looks good, super price, and compact.My son wanted the same system for his video games after hearing mine, and we purchased another-he is also very happy."
2,You get what you pay for is right...,"I just finished listening to a variety of music on these speakers. I stuck with Altec because the last set was AWESOME. Unfortunately I can not say the same for this set. The sound is not clear and sharp. If you are a true music fanatic, don't get this set. I figured the Altec name would keep quality up there as it had in the past. Not the case here. I'm sending them back and upgrading. Lesson learned.If you are not real picky on the sharpness of the sound that comes out of your stereo, then these will please you."
3,"Ok, but not great.","I purchased a set of Lansing before and they were amazing. So, I thought in buying an upgrade, I would get the same brand. Unfortunately, these did not do my old ones any justice. The louder you go, the fuzzier the quality. I'm a musician and to not hear all of the details because of the static was a true disappointment. However, they are not bad speakers for general listening. If you needed a quick buy for cheap, these are the ones for you."
4,Great !!,I have had the speakers for about a month. I am extremely impressed with the sound and the price cannot be beat. I would buy again without hesitation.
4,Makes my ears happy,"Over the years I have tried various computer speaker manufacturers, but time and time again, I keep coming back to Altec Lansing. At any price point, their products just plain sound better!"
2,No bass!,"I bought these because of the high ratings and was quite disappointed. The speakers sounded tinny - no spaciousness in the sound. Midrange was disappointing, and bass was completely non-existent, except for a low power hum when I turned up the volume.Maybe for gaming they would be OK, but not for classical music! I tested them on Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor. The Cambridge Soundworks system on my wife's computer sounds great with the same youtube."
1,Piece of Junk,I have never ever seen a worse 2.1 channel in my life. The subwoofer is really really crappy and cannot reproduce bass properly. The satellites are also very mediocre.Frankly I've quite had it with Altec lansing and wont buy anything from them again
2,Fails to please,"""Brilliant"" claims Minette Waters on the fly leaf (?!) Well she also said ""Deja Dead"" by Kath Reichs was ""Unputdownable"" so I guess we should all have learned to take her recommendations with a pinch of salt by now!""Laughable"" might be more appropriate. Except that this book is so bad it is not funny. An implausable plot that turns only on the poor choices of cardboard characters. The daily dirge of dreary Rachel et al is described in minute detail and to no advantage that I can see - beyond padding a threadbare plot.""Preposterous"" if we are expected to believe, for example, that the once beautiful but now aged beyond her years and socially inadequate Rachel transforms overnight into a femme fatal capable of seducing a muscular, young stud. The book lost me right there and then.""Forgetable"". Eager To Please? Oh, please!"
4,i suppose its good,"i think this book may be good. I just got it in the mail and hour ago. The thing about this book is that i compared it to online sources and my other dictionary and one of the words are wrong, so im hoping it won't misguide me. I actually thought this was going to be an interchangeable e wa jiten, but its just a english dictionary....but i think it may be helpful. I can't say from now, since its such short notice"
5,Wow,This dictionary is amazing. It includes a Hiragana and a Katakana chart. The words are (obviously)translated into Japanese in Kanji with Hiragana or Katakana suffixes to help you pronounce the words. The helpimg sentences allow the person to see how the word can work in everyday conversations. This truly is a very amazing dictionary!
3,Kodansha's Communitive English-Japanese Dictionary,"The book is a hard cover book with excellent paper and printing. Even the furigana print is high quality although you might need a magnifying glass to read the kana on top. The book says it is ""A practical and comprehensive reference for learners at all levels."" I am a beginning Japanese student. I have memorized the Hiragana and Katakana syllabaries and reviewed many Kanji. I found the book un-useable at my level. I am light on Japanese grammar and hoped the book would help me understand the grammar better. Appendix A goes over Japanese Grammar but expects the reader to have a greater understanding of English Grammar than I have. Appendix A could use more examples and explanations. Maybe after I learn more about Japanese Grammar (maybe from another book) I will then be able to use this book."
3,Jessica Simpson Shoes - White,"I was desperately seeking a pair of white sling backs for a particular occasion. I could not find them in the stores anywhere. I searched the internet and found these shoes. They were exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately, I would not receive them in time for the occasion, but I ordered them anyway, as it was summer and I did not own a pair of white dress shoes. These shoes were suprisingly comfortable. I especially like the rubber soles and tip on the heels. These were definitely a keeper given the great price. Who knew Jessica Simpson had a line of shoes?"
2,"Cute, but very uncomfortable","They are very versatile. You could wear them with anything, but they are not comfortable. Definitely not for alot of walking."
1,Practice tests are of very low quality,"I purchaced this 2 book package because I need to brush up for the Network+ test. I thought these books would be good since they came with so many practice questions. The FIRST test I took with the MeasureUP software that comes on the CD of the 2nd book incorrectly marked 2 of my answers wrong. I verified my answers were correct by looking up the answers in the book's answer key. 2/45 questions were incorrectly marked! This is poor quality and thus unacceptable. This was all on the first test! I do not know how many other questions are getting marked incorrectly.Another side note is the poor quality of the first eBook. There are what I will call ""guide marks"" marked on every page of the PDF. It appears this is the same copy that went to printing presses."
4,101 Hadith Kudsi,"Collection of Hadit Kudsi by Ibn Al'Arabi . There are a lot of lessons as Hadith #48 where Allah the Glorious says ""be satisfied with what I have given you"" Most of the hadiths are about God's generosity for the believers and those who pray and ask for forgiveness."
5,Brutality cranked to 11,"The Red Chord never disappoints with their releases. Every album keeps getting more defined, dynamic and brutal. Not many bands can pull off this type of music and at the same time keep it all coherent and able to keep you interested. I noticed there is a lot more groove to this album than previous ones which is very welcome. It doesn't feel contrived either, it's all feeling. In the end all the pieces fit and you understand exactly what The Red Chord was going for when they wrote this disc. They not only meet expectations, they shatter and surpass them."
5,"Furious, Intelligent Death/Tech Metal","This is my first experience with The Red Chord, which I decided to pick up on a whim at the local record store. After a couple of spins (back to back, I might add), I am definately a fan.The Red Chord play a very fast and agressive technical style of metal with ""death"" style vocals, and intense, hyper-busy drumming (of course). What sets this band apart for me, however, is the interesting (and disturbing) concept of the album itself; seemingly the story of a former politician's descent into guilt-ridden paranoia, delusions and madness- as well as the sheer intensity and experimentation of the music. The guitar and bass are a rapid-fire barrage; constantly either morphing into another cool, technical and odd-metered riff or stopping on a dime to do something completely unexpected. I'm definately interested in hearing more of this band....highly recommended for any fan of intense and intelligent modern metal."
3,It was okay,"While the CD played without any issues, the jewel case that it came in was not fully attached and was broken in multiple places. The package that it came in was stuffed with too many CD's, which probably led to the damage."
4,"A classic, timeless adventure-romance","A charming, witty re-telling of the legend of Tam Lin, with a refreshingly common-sensical heroine, an appealing hero, a host of amusing or villainous supporting characters, and a genuinely eerie faery court. The plot moves along briskly and suspensefully, and there's a very nice sense of place."
4,Great Read,"I enjoyed this book immensely once I got into it. The first chapter didn't impress me, but after that the book held my attention. The main character, Kate, was a great heroine that I enjoyed reading about and she had her own flaws, which I thought was great. Because most books in this sort of genre have the perfect, beautiful, strong, intelligent, courageous heroine, which I always found somewhat unbelievable. This book is adventursome, fantastical, and has some romance thrown in too. Its my kind of book! I plan on looking for more books by this author."
5,Great book!,"I was skeptical about getting the book at first. I am interesting in Tuodor England, but Fairy Folk? Well, I finally got it, and it's a great book. I've always loved historical fiction, but now I'm getting into fantasy. It has romance, action, magic, mystery, and includes everyone's favorite holiday, Halloween."
3,Unimpressed,"I didn't find this book all that special. The style seemed stilted and awkward. Characters seemed emotionally flat and I didn't buy the romance in the story. Not a bad read, but half way through I was ready for the book to end."
5,I couldn't put it down!,"i LOVED this book! I was intriuged by the Fairie queen,who kept a mysterious aura thoughout the book. Kate Suttun had a personalty teetering between ignorance and stubbornence,and strong will and caringness. Kate doesn't enjoy her life until she meets the Fairie Queen.She is terrified when the Fairie Queen is her capturer."
2,Good Sound Bad Remote,"The sound quality is great for the price. The remote is junk. It only works from about four feet away from the eye. Furthermore, there is no display to let you know what function you have selected on the remote so you are constantly guessing as to what controls are being selected. You get what you pay for I guess. Pay a few bucks more and avoid the frustration."
1,Customer Support is LACKING!!!,I have been a loyal Altec Lansing customer for many years but after the purchase of these speakers I have decided to buy my PC speakers from a different manufacturer. Sounds is great when is simple stereo but when in 5.1 there is hardly any bass. Customer support from Altec gets a big zero as I received no reply after sending 2 e-mails to customer support. In my opinion your money would be better spent on speakers from another company than ALTEC.
4,Great speakers,"Sound quality is great, the bass is alright (ideal for college students in dorms... but will still hit the neighbors, haha)The satellite speakers could be better quality, but the sound is alright...durability is ok, but you wont be moving them around that much, so mount them and it will be all ok."
1,Disappointing,"One of the rear satellite speakers did not work for me. I connected the speakers to two different computer systems to rule out problems other than the speakers themselves, and the same problem with both, the right rear satellite speaker would not work. I did check out the sound for a two speaker configuration, and was less than thrilled with the sound quality even at that. The sound was not very strong, almost ""tinny"" compared to my Altec Lansing cheapies that I was looking to replace. I returned these speakers for a refund.About the best thing I can say for this VS3251 system is it made me appreciate my old set of speakers a whole lot more after I reconnected them."
3,very good for a while,i bought this about 3 months ago and sound was great! but... after a good period of time i started hearing a lot of fuzz in the sound so this is very good for price but not so good in long term use
2,Poland's pseudo cuisine,"The book is beautifully illustrated and edited with some potenitally interesting recipes ideas such as beetroot creme brulee. The main idea behind the book is to provide nouvelle cuisine gloss to the good old traditional Polish cooking. However, the book does not carry through this idea very well, resulting sometimes in strange and extremely costly recipes which cannot be afforded by an average cooking enthusiast. Lussiana recommends many fine ingredients, but the way he combines them suggests that he does not really understand their chemistry. Perhaps the trouble is that he is very new to Polish culture which he needs to understand thoroughly to make his new ideas compatible with it. A reading such as Gary Rhodes' ""New British Classics"" could serve as an excellent example of new and exciting ideas based on a real understanding of centuries long British traditions and culture topped up with the chef's true talent and passion for cooking."
3,Was a bit hard reading.,I thought the book to be ok. It was tough reading because of the sentence construction. Was almost like it was written in a foreign language and maybe it was translated...I don't know. It did provide some insights to what F1 racing is all about and how as a new driver to it you need to bring lots of money to it...and its that way even today.
4,Head Over Feet is an awsome song!,"I would recommend the song, Head Over Feet by Alanis Morissette to anyone! It is such a neat song; I LOVE it!!! She is such a wonderful singer. I think she packs all the rage of females into one tiny, little song! It is incredible."
1,where is it ???,Amazon offered this book for purchase over a year ago. i ordered at that time and have been put off several different times. although Amazon isnot responsible for publishing the book they are responsible for makingit available for sale to the public without having to revise the shipping date over and over. Amazon needs to develope better communications with the sellers it deals with otherwise customers such as myself will lose confidence.
3,better than the last 3.5 stars,"i don't give out stars easily, so 3.5 does mean it is good. it builds on their last album. i really enjoy it and i think it will continue to grow on me. not for all the love in the world is the top track."
4,Very Cool,"I'm a 38 year old who came of age in the 80's. My tastes run toward hooky pop a la Replacements, New Radicals, Supergrass, Ryan Adams, Third Eye Blind, Prince, etc. I never heard the first Thrills album . . but I'm digging this. A few very hooky songs: Tell Me Something I Don't Know, Corey Haim, Irish Keep Gate Crashing. I'm going to buy their first one."
2,Not up to standard of first album.,"Well, I loved the first album 'SO Much For The City' by The Thrills. It kind of reminded me of how The Beach Boys sounded in the 70's; lots of banjo and great hooky melodies.I'm sorry, but the trend doesn't continue on this album. The songs are very forgettable, and have none of the 'California sound'.I have seen the video for the song 'Not For All The Love In The World' and quite like the song, but the chorus doesn't go where I imgaine it should :)Every time I hear it, I want the last bar to go to a certain chord, but it doesn't and disappoints me :SSo, for me, the whole thing suffers from 'second album syndrome'; it sounds like they used up all their good material on the 1st album."
3,"The Thrills ""Let's Bottle Bohemia""","""Tell Me Something I Don't Know"" (7/10)""Whatever Happened To Corey Haim"" (7/10)""Faded Beauty Queen"" (8/10)""Saturday Night"" (9/10)""Not For All The Love In The World"" (7/10)""Our Wasted Lives"" (7/10)""You Can't Fool Old Friends With Limosines"" (9/10)""Found My Rosebud"" (7/10)""The Curse Of Comfort"" (7/10)""The Irish Keep Gate-Crashing"" (9/10)The Thrills' sophomore record is a solid effort. The songs are still catchy, and they seemed to have left their California sound behind (something i don't mind at all). Standout tracks include ""The Irish Keep Gate-Crashing"" and ""You Can't Fool Old Friends With Limosines.""Overall rating: 7.7 out of 10."
4,21 individual articles,"The book consists of six parts:I. Offshore technology (mobile units, stability and moving; wind-wave-and current forces on offshore structures, spread mooring systems, dynamic positioning)II. Motion compensation and marine risers (tensioning systems, marine risers, surface motion compensation)III. Blowout prevention (offshore blowouts and fires, annular blowout preventers, choke/kill valves, unitized blowout preventers, procedures, subsea control systems)IV. Subsea production and diving operationsV. Drill string testing (downhole, production testers and burners)VI. Certification and insurance"
2,Dissapointed!,"From the pictures you can not tell that this is a very SMALL cake and toy. The value for the current price of 9.99 is much better, but for the almost $16.00 it was a true disappointment. Many small children love cat toy size items to play with and this would be one for them."
3,surprised by gund,"Gund typically has a great reputation. This product, however, took me by surprise. It was much smaller than I thought, which means that the pieces inside were even smaller. I'm concerned my son could choke on the hat which he can completely fit in his mouth. And the little present is only about 1-2 inches tall, easily fitting in a child's mouth if squished in little hands. Seems this could be a safety issue. I thought it cost too much for what it's worth. I bought this through pearlkids on amazon. It took much longer to get here than it should have (everything elase arrived in two days...this took over a week). Cute idea, but disappointing."
4,XP firewall not enough!!,"Windows Firewall does not block outgoing connections. Check this using leaktest at www.grc.com.""Just so you know, WinXP's built-in firewall does not attempt to manage or restrict outbound connections at all. It appears to be a useful firewall for hiding the machine from the Internet (it has ""stealth mode"" unsolicited packet handling), but you will still need to use a good third-party personal firewall if you wish to manage and control outbound connections from your system."" Quoted from the GRC website.I tested it myself. Zonealarm did block this whereas XP did not. This means that when my wife clicked on an IM virus, it was blocked by Zonealarm instead of sending out copies to all of her friends and email acquintances. With only XP, the virus would have spread."
1,Program has bugs,I have used the Zonlabs Firewall for several years. It works fine. I can not say the same for the Security Suite. The AntiSpam function does not update definitions and ZoneLabs Tech Support know they have a problem. They are working on it but no date for a fix.Do not buy this software until all the bugs are fixed.
3,"ZoneAlarm does the job, but it irritates...","This software installed just fine. Our biggest beef is that we don't know what it's doing behind the scenes. The logs are pitifully thin. On a daily basis, our system ""goes to sleep"", and we're convinced it's due to ZA doing something behind the scenes. On a number of occasions, the Anti-Virus sweep has kicked off in the middle of a busy day, instead of running at its appointed time of 1:30 AM, when we're asleep. And many of the configuration screens where you can click boxes don't have enough information (for this novice, anyway) to make an informed decision about whether ""to check or not to check"". It seems to be less intrusive the Norton, but less intuitive, too. We just want to know what it is doing on our behalf, and the logs sure don't tell any stories."
2,"Good, for a while, but NO tech support","When I first received the product and installed it I had a few configuration issues (not unusual) but now, after 8 months of service, they are telling me I need to purchase an upgrade ($69.99) or I will have no virus protection. I contacted Customer Service (what a misnomer) as no one was available to actually speak to me and the automated system was like one of those automated phone loops you enter when trying to contact any company. I finally gave up and an now shopping for a newer and more reliable antivirus and protection system. I did not get a full year of service, got jerked around and have lost all faith in this software package. I wish any other users good luck!"
1,bad customer service,It's been 10 days since I registered with Zone Alarm and I still haven't received the license key. I wrote many emails and called customer service and I got no help or solution. Think twice before purchasing this product.
1,No record of Puchasing this Product Rating Zero thus far,"I do not have any recolection of purchasing this product, nor can I find it on my computer or in any of my hard non computer files. I have always ordered a hard disk back up of all purchases from Zone Alarm. There is no hard disk no Computer file. I am about to raise you Know what about this charge on my credit card. I will challenge it if I do not receive for what I am being charged. I will also ask My credit card Co. for a new number to prevent future charges from these folks. In the future I will use a third party encryted method for purchases on the internet. rehadik@netscape"
3,Adequate,The fiber framing strips are thin strips of cardboard. Nothing that looks like it will stand up for any length of time to wet weather. The plastic does seem to be adequate for the job.
1,Clear plastic ?,"I just finished installing this outside one window in my cottage 24""x 60"". Just enough for 1 window and to put it on properly took about 3 hours. I could have done it in 1 hour if I used some thin flat wood trim but it comes with some cardboard strips that you are supposed to cut to length + wrap in the plastic several times before nailing with the supplied tiny Chinese nails. I hope this protects the cardboard. Do yourself a favor and buy some brads that are slightly longer than the thickness of your fingers. I don't trust the 3M outdoor kits because they rely on double-stick tape which doesn't stick below 50F. Still I only give this 1 star because it is not clear and it is thin. The package says clear but it looks like frosted glass. Are the 3M kits clear?"
2,Dissapointing,"I purchased the korean version of this film, under the impression it was a like a korean ""Tarantino"" or ""Guy Ritchie"" movie. Needless to say, it was not. While this ordinarily wouldn't be a problem, the film you do get simply doesn't hold up. The ""stylish cinematography"" I was told to expect wasn't very, and the action sequences just didn't feel very solid. It's got an amusing moment or two, and the three-way time lapse cut was pretty unique, but this doesn't save barely on par acting built on a mediocre script. Go watch Lock Stock again."
1,guns and talks,"This movie SUCKS. Extremely slow pace, boring, uninspired acting. Totally lame and weak."
5,Love Notes ISBN 0-9632749-0-2,"I want to share with you my feelings on Love Notes. My wife read the book and kept tugging on me to read it. With a title like Love Notes I refused, since I am not a reader for romance type books, but this was different. Love Notes deals with a lot of topics that hit home for anyone like love and loss, personal life and business. This is a love story that shows how two mid-thirties children deal with the loss of their mother and learn about the value of a ""real"" relationship as they watch thier father re-live his relationship with their mother through love letters that they exchange during a breif separation in their relationship. It's a bit heavy, but the impact is very moving. It's a story like Ghost, which makes you re-evaluate what's important in your life."
4,You will laugh till you pee your pants.,"Forget about the story line. It is the one liners of this movie that are so funny!!!!! I have seen this movie more than 10 times and I still laugh. I catch something new each time. Wesley is great. John is soooo funny, his mannerisms, everything say ""Latina baby!"" Patrick...well he just seems to comfortable in this role...I don't know. I hope you like it!"
5,What an adorable movie!,"What a clean movie considering what it's about! It's nice to have a movie like this that you can still show your kids and know that nothing bad will be seen! Patrick looks great as a woman, as do Wesley and John; hat's off to these great actors who could pull this off! Patrick - we miss you! :("
1,WHY?WHY WHY?,"WHY do they edit out scenes from the VHS version???.I was watching and I have seen this movie on tape alot of times...and I said something's MISSING???...well it's all in the ""BONUS FEATURES""...JOHN LEGUIZAMO had to be MAD, cause many of his great scenes were just cut!!...why do the studios do this???...I am SO mad about this..who am I gonna fight???""CITY HALL"" forget it!!...JUST get the tape & do NOT throw out your tape machine yet, cause I've heard they did this on another movie I bought(forget which one)..I gave the tape away already"
5,Awesome movie,"It's poignant, it's irreverent, it makes you laugh, and it makes you cry...a remarkable movie!"
4,Give me a body like John Leguizamo!!!,"Don't turn up your lip at this wonderful, fun, frolic. Drag queens any girl (woman) would love to call friend, there may not be a lot of substance, and may not change your life, but, it certainly is enjoyable fun. Let me tell you, these three men clean up really nice, and, watching the transformation of a dying population of women metamorph into the delightful divas of fun is worth the sit through the movie. Don't deny yourself some fun. You have to respect these three hunks for being confident enough to play dress-up."
2,a silly movie........,"Okay.. when you look at the cover for this movie..you must be thinking ""i would watch this because? ""... And I thought that too when my two friends and I saw it at the video store... But it was there.. and we just HAD to watch it.. It looked so stupid lol.. And we watched it.. and for some reason.. We would laugh at everything... Maybe we were acting stupid.. but it was a fun experience.. and we STILL watch it ocasionally... because for some reason.. we can't stop laughing.. I think its one of those silly movies that you got to get a group of your close friends and watch it.. But I dont recommend it if you are searching for a serious, oscar worthy movie lol.. Just to make new memories... And after your done watching it.. you can think ""WHAT DID I JUST WATCH? """
1,"Copycat movie of the Australian movie ""The Adventures Of Pricilla, Queen Of The Desert""","This movie is nothing but a copy of the Australian movie ""The Adventures Of Pricilla, Queen Of The Desert"". Typical!!! Just like the original English BBC series of ""The Office"" which was copied and remade in the USA.Stop stealing ideas from other countries."
1,"Full of propoganda, amoung other things...REALLY BAD !","None of the three male stars in this movie were convincing homosexual-transvestites. I found it very hard to watch this movie. It's not funny at all and the propoganda in it is so obvious(I suppose that's a good thing). It does nothing but try to brain-wash any and all things that are natural about being a real man. While I don't believe in being violent towards homosexuals, I do believe that accepting this unnatural behavior, as somehow natural, is the most damaging thing you can do to those who practice this life style. To truly love your neighbor is to help him and to help by warning them of the dangers of their life style.I was so surprised to see these three men playing these roles. It's hard for me to see them as real men in anything else now.A real man will absolutely hate this film. I warn you, you can potentially be brain-washed if you watch it. [].I don't recommend this movie at all !!!"
3,"If you want comedy, here it is!","The true test of comedy is that it has to be funny. This movie really is. It will tickle the funny bone. This was a really good role for Wesley Snipes who played what had to be the ugliest drag queen I've seen. Even the man who played opposite Robin Williams in Birdcage looked like a better woman. He played with a flamboyance that drag queens really have. Swayze was perfect because, up to this point he's played the ultimate male. He looked pretty good as a woman. He basically played his role like Hoffman did with Tootsie, playing a better friend than either a man or woman could be. And the Latino/a? Very spicy, ala Rosie Perez! He/she popped off some good line. I think the romance side bar pushed it a little bit but his catfights with Swayze? Meow, Meow!"
4,"Campy fun, but not for the homophobic","I went with my husband and a friend. The friend walked out in the opening sequence. He was really freaked out by Patrick and Wesley changing from men to women. Me, I loved it. I don't give 5 stars at all and rarely 4's, so this is high praise from me (I'm a hard grader). Because you don't see John go through the tranformation, its really hard to remember he is a man unless you've seen him in other roles. Wesley is very silly and very camp. Patrick is too darn beautiful and stately. Very scary. As others have said, forget the plot and enjoy the fun."
3,"John Leguizamo was so good, I thought he was Rosie Perez!","Fun, harmless entertaining. Nothing to get excited about, but it is amusing thanks to it's strange casting choices. Any movie with Stockard Channing has to have some merit! Swayze and Snipes are fun and Rosie Perez (oops!) is hysterical. Leguizamo deserves a lot more recognition for his body of work."
2,What happened to my favorite scene????,"I love this movie- I think it is one of the sweetest movies ever. So when I decided that I needed a DVD after my old video finally croaked I was thrilled to find it here on Amazon. Unfortunately several scenes have been cut on the DVD including my favorite one, where Patrick Swayze's character delivers a much deserved thrashing to an abusive husband. The scene is about half the length it is on my old video & a couple of others are shortened as well. This is a wonderful movie & I hope to find an uncut one on DVD somewhere."
3,good clean drag queen fun,"The plot is weak, but John Leguizamo played Chi Chi so brilliantly I actually forgot he wasn't a woman.Patrick Swayze is graceful and fairly convincing as a woman, but Wesley Snipes just doesn't do it as hard as he tries; he's just too much of a ""man's man"" to pull it off.a good popcorn flick to watch with the girls..whether they were born or made."
5,What's not to like?,"Good acting, hiliarious, interesting story line, and absolutely entertaining. Definitely watch it."
5,To Wong Foo Thanks for Everyting Julie Newmar,This was an excellent movie. It arrived within the time stated by Amazon. I enjoy the movie due to the laughs.
4,What a romp!,"I've been a huge fan of this movie since it came out, so I can't say enough about it. It is at times hilarious and heartbreaking. It's a good forum for how lines are easily blurred between ""outcasts"" and ""normals"".Heartwarming story that teaches us all that everyone, no matter their beliefs, dreams, and differences, are at their heart, all the same. And that sometimes getting ""Lost"" along the way is the best part of any journey. And Wesley Snipes in drag is worth the price of admission!"
3,Drag queen love.,"To Wong Foo Thanks for Everything Julie Newmar is a cute and funny film about three drag queens who want to be legends. Patrick Swayze is the prettiest man/woman ever! Wesley Snipes, well he isn't so graceful. This is a great buddy buddy flick, check it out sometime."
4,Patrick in Drag,Patrick Swayze is magnificent in this story of a three drag queens journeying across country from NY to LA. They win the hearts of a small town and eventually one of them wins the national drag queen title. It is a good movie with many funny situations and addresses discrimination and spouse abuse in a hilarious manner.
3,"to wong foo thanks for everything, julie newmar","I saw this movie years ago and laugh my butt off. To see 3 ICONS dressed as DRAG QUEENS was so funny, I ordered it for my niece to see. We sat there and laugh and laugh at them. A must see for anyone who needs a good laugh."
5,Big Surprises in Big Packages,"My wife and I both love this movie for many reasons. One - is a great comedic flick - two - it is a great ""buddy"" movie - three - it is also a great lesson in life and of strong values. You want to cheer at the end - even if you forget who is who."
5,INFO...,"Computer adventure games that build on students' interest in mystery and adventure as well as their abilities in mathematics and logical thinking. Games and lessons designed to help 3rd graders get straight ""A""s."
4,Excellent boots,"Yes, when you first get them they are very stiff, but this is true of any boot that isn't fabric. The material gets flexy after a good day's wearing. They are very comfy to stand in, I walked to and from my afternoon class that's 8 blocks away, then stood for the entirity of my 3 hour drawing class without a problem.Only complaint, the man made material doesn't breathe well, and the calves are large for the thin-legged (handy though, i can stick my phone, wallet and keys down there.) Also the pocket got me all excited but it's not terribly functional.Overall, well worth the price."
3,More common sense than anything,"This book is a quick read and is a nice break from all the people who proclaim clipping coupons is the way to save money. However, if you already buy a lot of private label/store brand products, plan your weeks meals after you check the sale flyers and buy in bulk when things are on sale, there's not a whole lot more in this book.She does go into some detail about marketing strategies which is somewhat interesting, but if you are already budget minded, don't think this book can help you slice your grocery bill by a third, maybe 10-15% (which is nothing to sneeze at). Basically, I checked this book out of my library and I think you should too."
4,This indepth study of a maternity ward is a winner!,"What an amazing book! Jerry Gentry studied the patients, nurses, and doctors that make up the Grady Hospital Maternity Ward in Atlanta. He follows several mothers on their journey through prenatal care, pregnancy, and the births of their children. He then follows up after the babies are born. I found this book compelling because it demonstrates every aspect of its subjects' lives. You feel like you personally know the people discussed. It is an emotional and monetarial journey of hardships for most of the mothers involved. Being an Atlanta native this novel has given me new respect for Grady hospital. A great ethnography for anyone interested in the subject and/or social behavior."
4,Grady Baby delivers gripping true life stories,I found this book hard to put down.I constantly kept thinking of what the main characters might pull next.This book demonstrates that life can be stranger than fiction.
5,bj and the bear,"yes i agree they need to bring bj and the bear out on dvd. all the old shows are coming back with a big hit, why not this one too!!! we need more movies like this out!"
2,pro-tech elbow strap,this strap is flimsy and made for small children. I had a hard time wraping it around my arm (too short). did not support my elbow well becaused it stretched too much during work outs.
3,Too wide,"My wife purchased this and at 5'4"", she found the support too wide (top to bottom) and does not stay in place well."
1,Product was defective,I had to return this product. It was defective. There was a complete blank and the movie did not show.
1,Save your money,"Great movie as a work of fiction. This movie does not present the facts as known at the time. If you want to discover the truth about this murder, read the original news and magazine articles of the time."
4,A good documentary,"As an African-American I am interested in movies about Black history, Black culture, and life during slavery and historical black events.As a result I purchased about a dozen DVDs on various subject matter which I am just now getting around to viewing.I had heard about the Emmett Till case and was looking for educational information about the case.This DVD gave me a little more insight into case, but not much more I couldn't have guessed on my own.I think everyone is aware of the kind of justice system in the south during the 50's so the outcome of the trial was not unexpected."
4,Zen Flute CD,This is a little less traditional/not what I am used to but was good none the less. It's a good CD to help in selecting pieces to do with flute alone.
5,excellent service,I recieved the book in a very timely manner. The seller communicated very well. The book was in excellent condition and very special to me. The seller cared about my interest in the book.
2,died in less than a year,"Mine died in less than a year, with only sparse use (maybe once a month). I will not buy this brand again."
2,Rival rice cooker,"I bought this to replace my old rice cooker, which finally died. Horrible! It burned the rice on the bottom every single time I used it, plus the rice was always dried out, even when I didn't use the warming cycle. The only reason I gave it even two stars is that it was a reasonable size and didn't take up a lot of storage space."
3,uncook rice,"Hi,I am first time to purchase this product that's why, I would like to know is that HOW MANY CUPS OF UNCOOK RICE is the capacity of this product. I saw lots of rice cooker brand here and I notice that most of them specify how many cups of uncook and cooked rice or minimum to maximum cook and uncook cups of rice...I would like to make sure first before i purchase this product..."
5,Great Product,"I live it, no problems so far, great price point!Cooks rice really fast, and my whole family now enjoys rice without any complaints!"
2,Uneven cooked rice,"Used this rice cooker for 3 months. The rice has cooked unevenly, hard on top and soggy on the bottom. The non- stick coating starting to come off, and several scratches (lines) on the bottom. The only good thing is the rice does not stick to the pot. The steamer is of no use. Tried to cook some meat with the steamer while cooking the rice - the rice was done but the meat was undercooked. This rice cooker will be donated to Salvation Army."
4,Its cool,"The first episode is awesome the next too are pretty good, I own this as well as monster wars and this is the better of the two!"
5,Look phenomenal.,"After going for about a year without doing any cosmetic upgrades to my Wrangler, I finally decided to beef it up a little bit. These were my first purchase, and I couldn't have been happier. They look great and offer adequate protections for the taillights.-Installation took me about 30 minutes and hit no snags. You have to take off the taillight cover first, then take out the actual lamps so you can get the guards on, then plug the lamp back in, reattach the cover and boom, done. (In hindsight, when unplugging the light, make sure to keep a grip on the plug, as it could easily fall back into the frame and then create a hassle to get it back in finger's reach.Overall, a product I would highly recommend."
4,Almost Perfect,"After doing ton's of research on light guards for my 95 YJ, I decided to go with Rampage. The fit was flawless & the hardware included fit well. The only problem is that the spare tire no longer hits the tire bump, instead it now hits the light guard. I sure a solid whack from the tire will damage the guards. I don't think it will be an issue, but with my kids anything is possible. I plan on installing footman loops & a door strap on the rear tailgate & door just to be on the safe side. Great product."

This product does not come with the remote tester. It comes with the items pictured in the second and third pictures, but not the first."
1,Inaccurate,"This book contains a shallow and inaccurate precis of a chapter I published in another book in 1995. The entry under my name, which comes up in a Google search, was never seen and certainly not authorised by me, nor was I told of its publication (for obvious reasons). While I have not read the whole book (and won't be reading it), I can only assume that other entries were obtained in a similar fashion and are of a similar quality with regard to accuracy and depth of understanding."
2,Just use the 3ds User Reference,"I got this book thinking that I would learn alot more about max r4. Yes I did get a few tips and tricks but nothing big. This book goes on and on with pages full of nothing that isn't in the 3ds User Reference or Tutorials. There isn't much Hand-On training which is a must for everyone if you are looking to work with Max I mean really isn't that what the books are for. You get a little hands on but nothing big or anything. This book should be renamed 3ds max r4 Reference Guide. Needs alot more Hands on Tutorial and Less reviewing of things that are already in the Max Help files. Don't waste your money on this book get another book that has more hands on training and less review of the max help guides. If this is the cast I might as well write a book and just copy everything from the max help files and publish it, because it seems that is basiclly what happened here."
5,Teacher's Highest Recommendation,"As a college instructor of MAX modeling, texturing, and animation, I both recommend this book to my students and use it myself as a resource. I had the pleasure of contributing to this work in a few sections, and so had the opportunity to examine this work closely as it was written. In addition to providing comprehensive instruction on all areas of MAX, Cat Woods discusses the principles of 3D space and the creation of 3D art with greater elegance and clarity than any book I have encountered on the subject. Those struggling with the tools will find help here. A must-have for beginners, and a strong resource for experienced users."
3,Works for me (in a weird way),"Some background: I have some experiences with 3d programs like Form Z and I've been using that program for 2 years. I decided to try out max because well someone gave me the program. I have no clue on how to work this program butI was amazed by how fast the darn thing renders when my friend showed it to me. So I brought this book so I could learn more.This book is... well confusing, sorry to say it skips steps and it is poorly writen. What I thought was great about this is that it forces me to do the excerises by myself which took a long time but I did learn the key concepts. This book finally makes sense when I actually went over the excerises again. This book could be a potenially good book of reference."
5,The best book about life after college,This is such a great book. I have not laughed this hard from a book since well his last book. If you have not read one of his books yet you need to go out and buy one.
4,Funny read for Twenty Somethings,"If you are a fan of Karo and regularly read his Ruminations e-mail column, you will enjoy this book but feel a bit slighted that a lot of the material seems like it was taken directly from his columns. If you haven't read his e-mail columns you are missing out! That being said, Karo's second book is hilarious! He has the natural ability of taking the everyday crap that we see and putting it into words that make you laugh out loud. It's worth buying and you will probably read it in one or two sittings as it is a quick read. For all of you cubicle dwellers, get this book and read it at work when you are hungover and hating life. You will laugh your butt off!"
3,Decent follow up to College Ruminations,"Not as funny as his first book, but 20-somthing Ruminations delivers quick, witty antecdotes of life after college. Great bookshelf stocker!"
5,So hilarious!,"I bought this book and read it that same afternoon. I just could not put it down. It's absolutely hilarious. It's very insightful into the mind of a twentysomething guy. Everyone who I have told about Aaron Karo has just loved his writing also.If you want a book that will make you laugh really hard out loud, pick this one up...you won't regret it!"
1,What's all the hype about ?,"So ... I buy this book , because I am 22 , and finishing college and I see it on line . Mistake , mistake , mistake , a waste of $9 , I should just have borrowed it from the library . He repeats himself , and all it is is cute quips about getting laid and working . It's something that is not a breath of fresh air , but a breath of stale air . It's not informative , its mostly a book about drunken gatherings . I personally found it bery boring and I am wondering if I can return it ... or regift it , but that might seem tacky ."
2,You can get this for free.,"Basically all taken out of his online column (which you can read for free at his web page). It's moderately funny, but after a while it's just the same old ranting. He was funnier before he had a girlfriend."
2,Ruminations on a Rich Obnoxious Dork,"This kid isn't funny. Yeah, he's ""smart"" (as he lets us know his SAT scores). But this kid is a tool, a generic frat boy who quit his job so he could lean on mommy and daddy while he became an ""eccentric"" comedian. If he didn't have $$, girls wouldn't give him the time of day. (Who is he trying to kid?)"
3,Not very funny,"It was not up to the humor and cleverness of the earlier ""road"" movies. I was surprised it was filmed in black & white in 1962, not in color."
3,Road to Hong Kong Review,A bit of a let down. Not up to the standard of the usual Crosby/Hope movies. Entertaining but the story line is weak compared to others of the genre. Hope adds the comedy element & without him the movie would have flopped.
3,Road to HongKong,Their last movie together and their gags and lines starting to where thin but still over all a reasonable film if you want the road series of crosby and hope.
3,Road to Hong Kong,Definetly not the best of the Road pictures but mildly entertaining and worth having to complete the Road collection.Both Crosby and Hope are noticably older and really don't have the magic with Joan Collins like they did with Dorothy Lamour and the jokes are trying to be funny instead of just being funny.
3,Beware if you have a widescreen TV...,"This is a fine presentation and packaging of the seventh (and weakest) of the Crosby-Hope ""Road"" series. True fans will want this for their collection, and I agree that Hong Kong is not as bad as it is often portrayed. In the era of Austin Powers, this film actually picks up some points for kitch; it was arguably the first spoof of the '60s spy thriller.But there is one very unfortunate flaw in this DVD version. Even though this is the first release of this movie in widescreen, this DVD is not optimized for widescreen televisions. So if you have a wdiescreen TV this movie will appear letterboxed on all four sides, the frame of the picture will not fill out your widescreen from left to right. This is an infuriating lapse on the part of MGM."
3,End of the Road,"This is the last Road movie made by Hope and Crosby. Both were around 60 and Crosby in particular looks stricken by the sophomoric playacting and the effort of simulating attraction to Joan Collins. Hope tries to jolly him through their scenes together and manages to scare up a laugh or two, especially in the pre-credit sequence. But it's only during Dorothy Lamour's too-brief guest appearance that the old magic returns. At 47, she looks younger than ten years earlier in ""Bali,"" but she was too old for Hope and Crosby -- one of the sadder examples of male movie star vanity and a sour note to end a great series on. If you're smart, you'll get off the Road at ""Rio."""
3,"One ""Road"" Too Many","Released in 1962, ""The Road to Hong Kong"" was the final cinematic journey for Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and (all too briefly) Dorothy Lamour. Cheaply filmed in England with Bob and Bing past their prime, this uneven escapade proved no match for the previous entries. Hilarity does occasionally ensue, but replacing Dorothy with Joan Collins was a big mistake. In a memorable four-minute cameo, Peter Sellers steals the show as an eccentric Indian doctor. Sammy Cahn and Jimmy Van Heusen contribute the film's best song, ""Teamwork."""
5,DVD,"I am happy with this purchase, as I had seen most of the ""Road"" pictures during my younger years, but had missed this and one other. Now in my 80's, it brings back the enjoyment I had 'way back when."
4,Anne Klein-Like Fine Wine,"Beautiful watch-excellent Vendor. I thought I had chosen a high-fashion, ""feminine"" timepiece. Deduct one star for being slightly larger than expected."
3,not really a movie....,"After a long wait, I finally had the chance to watch another remake of Bruce Lee's ""Fist of Fury"" (aka Chinese Connection) this time starring a worthy Donnie Yen. However, I was a bit disappointed understandably that this 25+ episode TV show being compiled into a 2 hour movie. If you did not see the original movie or Jet Li's ""Fist of Legend"", you'll be asking yourself many questions such as ""huh?"" and ""who is this guy?"" throughout the movie. Character development is nonexistent and there are tons of missing plotlines. The fighting is obviously sped up and seems more comical than realistic. I'm not sure why they did this, but the fight scenes at regular speed would've been just fine. The ""Enter the Dragon"" opening theme music gets annoying since they keep playing it before or during a fight scene.I hope Tai Seng or another company will release the entire 25 episode series on DVD to fill in the plot holes.3 stars for Donnie Yen doing his best Bruce Lee impersonation."
1,There can only be one original,"My goodness!! I expected more than this from Donnie Yen after seeing 'Iron Monkey' part 1. Just too much camera tricks to enjoy the beauty of martial art physical skill. In closing,you cant redo the famous painting ""Sun Flowers"" buy Van Gough,and expect to resell it as the original.I know its harsh,but there is only one 'Fist of Fury"" ,also done by an original master in his field."
1,Highly Disappointing!,"Even if you don't consider Bruce Lee, this is one of the most disappointing martial arts movies I have seen. A couple of fights scenes are okay, but the overall quality of the movie is simply . . . bad! In fact some of the fight sequences look as though they have been sped up. They're like older movies, where everyone moves faster than they would normally would (when it looks unnatural) - that's this movie.I'm a big Donnie Yen fan (based mainly on his IP Man movies) and bought this without seeing it. A big mistake. After about 20-30 minutes of watching this, I found myself fast-forwarding to the action sequences because it was so bad. Then I was disappointed in those as well.Cinematography, story, acting, action, sound, music . . . all poor.Watch another martial arts movie and STAY AWAY from this ""stinker."""
3,"An okay remake, but be forewarned...","Donnie Yen has great on-screen presence and acting ability, but his portrayal of Bruce Lee falls short. He has the ha-yah and stance down, but the fight scenes fall way short of the original movie. All of the fight scenes are sped up and the ones with Donnie tend to look weak because he's trying too hard to redo the scenes that Bruce Lee did. The fights end up being overdone or too weak. If the fights hadn't been sped up the film would have been way better. Donnie tries to be Bruce Lee as best he can, but he ends up being Donnie Yen again after the brief tell-tale Bruce Lee stare. I would've been much happier if they had given Donnie his own unique fighting style and personality instead of trying to pay homage to Bruce Lee (much like Fist of Legend did). Overall, the fighting scenes will leave you disgusted because they seem like cheap Bruce Lee ripoffs."
3,28 T.V. Episodes squeezed into a 2 hour DVD?!,"WHY????!!! If you have seen the entire ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC 28 episode T.V. Series then there is absolutely no reason to purchase this DVD. If you haven't seen the entire series and you don't feel like spending [money] to purchase it(depending on where you buy it), then definitely buy this DVD just for the amazing Donnie Yen who respectfully pays homage to Bruce Lee and pulls off some pretty spectacular fight scenes. You will also probally be annoyed that any semblance of a plot that originally took 28 episodes to unfold is quite noticeably absent. The score is ripped from Dragon:The Bruce Lee Story and there is a piece that begins with the first few bars from the Enter the Dragon theme song. Over all 28 hours worth of footage sliced, diced and crammed into 120 minutes. If you are a serious martial arts film fan then purchase the entire VCD set. Most DVD players also play VCD's. It is more than well worth it."
1,"Extremely Disappointing - Donnie does ""Dis"" Service","Out of all the Huo Yuan Jia and his student Chen Zhen films - this is by far the worst. I am so glad that Donnie has come to be a much better actor - it's a wonder anyone would cast him after this role... bad acting overshadowed his kung fu talent. The saddest part - this movie had a large budget and still couldn't compare to any of the old movies or series. Worse there is NOTHING original about this version - NOTHING. A matter of fact if you have seen the Bruce Lee version you may notice some of the same camera angles!! PS Chen Zhen never had a Japanese girlfriend (in case you were wondering). All I can say, in the words of Chen Zhen (Donnie Yen) ""WOOOOOO OOOO WO OW WOO - Stay away!"""
4,Great ride but.....,"This is a superb ride cymbal and sounds great. It takes a little distance for the sound to integrate well, so not the best up close, but very nice to the audience and overheads. I like it best with 2 rivets, and a little under-bell tape. The bell is marginal, but then we don't need the cut of a rock drummer. Build-up is near perfect, nice and clean until you over-do-it, then a big roar...."
4,Just About What I Wanted,"There are 2 versions of this DVD. I specifically wanted the older version, which is what was advertised. When I got the DVD it was the new version with extra songs that I personally did not want. Oh well... . Shipping was fast"
5,"Down to earth, practical, sympathetic to parents' struggles","Peter Jaksa is a very tuned-in, sensitive, practical therapist who provides a well-organized, highly readable book for parents who are struggling to make sense of parenting issues and family issues in this complex, difficult social environment of the late twentieth century. Dr. Jaksa charts a course for parents that gives hope and direction."
5,It's a really great CD.,I really enjoy Michael McDonald and this album is a compilation of all his more popular works. Michael McDonald a very creative musician.
4,"elegant look, down home price","I bought this watch to wear to my wedding. I am one of those people who feels naked without a watch.The watch fit my style of dress and jewelry and I wore it a few days beyond the wedding and honeymoon. I received a lot of compliments.My only complaint is that while I know it is not water resistant, during a heavy rainstorm, it did get water inside. It kept running, but it was not submerged, yet got water inside.Overall I give it a thumbs-up."
2,Looks Cheap & Band Can Only Have 2 Links Removed,"I received this watch as a Christmas gift. I have taken it to 1 jeweler and also a watch repair place - both have told me the same thing. The band can only be shortened by 2 links. So the watch wears more like a bracelet and this makes the face very susceptible to scratching.Also the watch looks very cheap, it looks much nicer in photos. The weight is not very substantial either."
4,75% great cd,"As many others have stated the first twelve tracks are taken directly from the movie and side-splittingly funny. The rest are interpretations of the songs by other artists. They're mainly hit and miss. Isaac Hayes Good Love 69969 isn't bad and is his usual Chef ""sweet love"" fair. The Violent Femmes version of I Can Change is good but isn't as funny as it is just better musically. Some people seem to be disappointed in the cd due to the filler tracks. That's understandable but if nothing else, treat it as a mini-cd. Just program your cd player to play the first half of the cd and you'll still be satisfied. I think part of the reason i wasn't disappointed is that i snagged it off the rack at the record store and didn't bother to look at the track listing. I assumed when track twelve finished playing the cd was over. So no build up, no disappointment. Just think back to the movie and if the songs in the film had you rolling, the cd is well worth your cash."
5,"hilarious, I never get tired of this","I have a home made copy of this cd that has only the original tracks, and none of the bonus ones. I am curious about the bonus tracks, but I hear they kind of suck, so I won't look for them. But the original songs are extremely funny, juvenile, and surprisingly well arranged. Whenever I want a good laugh I get this cd out. my favorite is ""blame canada,"" a song which surprisingly got nominated for an Oscar a few years ago, and they actually allowed them to perform it on tv (huh?). It is completely funny, innapropriate, and over the top. you should get it if you are at all interested by these traits, its a real funny thing."
5,Great CD,"This is a great CD. Southpark has some excellent song writers. They would have to change their style to be commercial, but they could do that. They might have to get help to change their style. If they get tired of the movie business, they could switch to the music business."
4,"This CD is for adults, BY adults!","This CD is exactly what it sets out to be, the soundtrack for the movie, & it succeeds. I would just like to point out to the guy below from Bozo, Idaho that Joe C. is AN ADULT who, I would venture to guess, wouldn't appreciate the threat of having his mouth washed out with soap OR being mistaken for a child."
1,Hell isnt Good,"I thought the songs were kinda funny, but the one song from the movie called ""Hell isnt Good"" sounds like James Hetfield from Metallica is singing it, but in the end credits, it says the song was done by DVDA, who is that?"
3,Fifty-fifty,"For me, this album was a pretty even split. The music that was used in the movie is hilarious: Stylistically it falls somewhere between a Lloyd Webber musical and Les Misérables, but with some pretty twisted lyrics. Naturally it's offensive, but it's equal-opportunity offense; everyone gets lambasted. The rest of it I don't even listen to. I did, once, the first time I played the CD...and didn't care for any of it, not even RuPaul's ""Super""."
3,"Half good, half bad","The first half of the tracks from the movie are great, but the rest of the CD blows to high heaven. If your a big South Park fan or really liked the movie you may overlook the bad remakes; otherwise I wouldn't recommend it."
4,This CD is by far one of the best soundtracks on the market,"This CD kicks some serious a**! All of the songs from 1-12 are the best on the track, including what would Brian Boitano do? Most of the interpretations supremely suck a**, except for Brian Boitano and Kyle's mom is a big fat b****. Other than that, the CD is pretty good."
4,Very funny,There are some very very funny songs on this cd like Kyles mom is a b*tch . its a good buy
5,Hella excellent!,"This reminds me of ""Tenacious D's"" cd, in the way that, other than being obviously hilarious, the quality of the music is astonishingly good. You don't expect a ""comedy"" cd to be this well done. I mean, despite all the language, this is almost the caliber of any other classic musical. Plus of course it's the funniest thing since the ""Chef Aid"" soundtrack, but better. All the tracks are good, but ""Up There"" and ""I'm Super"" are awesome. Also, the ""Michael Mcdonald"" song cracks me up, because he's such a well respected singer, yet the lyrics are funny. It's actually one of his best ever performances. The extras on the end of this disc are good, but it's the main songs that make this essential for any fan of ""South Park""."
4,Hillarious musical comedy,"When i went to see the Southpark movie I had no idea it was going to be a musical. I was taken aback by the quality and creativity of the music.OK - the lyrics are not always for the faint of heart, but they are catchy. You will find yourself humming many of the tunes as they become stuck in your head.As with any album, I have found some tracks I can play over and over; with others, once was enough. A friend of mine (with a PhD. in Musicology) became a Southpark fan after hearing this album."
3,Half a classic,"The first half of this CD consists of songs taken directly from the movie; it is a work of genius. The second half consists of ""interpretations"" of the movie's songs by various artists; it is tedious in the extreme. I would've preferred a skimpy, 30-minute ""original cast"" recording to what we have now. It just ain't funny if Kyle, Kenny, Stan, Cartman & Co. aren't singing it."
3,"12 out of 20 ain't too bad, could be worse.","I agree with those who said they wish they had seen the movie first. The songs straight from the movie allow those who have seen it to relive the movie over and over again. However, the album begins to go dowhill once the ""interpretations"" start. I liked song by Chef and I'll give D.V.D.A. and Violent Femmes credit for at least trying to keep the original lyrics in their versions. But the rap versions of the songs were bad, when I could understand them, and really seemed to have not much to do with the movie especially Joe C. and Kid Rock's version of ""Kyle's Mom is a Big Fat B****"""
4,Amazing!,"I watched the South Park movie late one night with my friends, but was kept awake by the energizing musical numbers. If you are able to accept the less than ""appropriate"" lyrics, the talent of both the singers and the backup orchestra is amazing. The selections are well arranged, the harmonies are pleasing to listen to and the whole thing has an all around feel-good quality. Not to mention the fact that it is hilarious. The soundtrack ends on a weaker note, but the first 12 songs never fail to put me and all my friends in a good mood! Definitely invest in this, if nothing else, it will make you laugh!"
5,It's hillarious!,"It's about time that someone had the guts to do a total take on all those damn irritating Disney quasi-musicals! Aren't there just time you wanna hear cartoon character go off their nut with swearing in a song? Matt Stone and Trey Parker deliver just that: I never laughed so hard at the first two verses of Uncle F**ka! Almost all of the interpretations on the CD aren't worth listening to (bar the Violent Femmes, D.V.D.A. and Chef :)), but the songs from the movie more than make up for it. One problem though: y'know when Kenny was being sent to Hell, and their was that kick-ass song playing in the background, You're Goin' to Hell? (appropriate title, yes?) What happened to that?"
4,"Brilliant, except for a few ""inspirational"" tracks","Even Disney has never come out with an animated vehicle that has as many consistently brilliant and melodic tunes as what's contained in this film (and album). A very pleasant surprise. One track after the next is a virtual showstopper, while simultaneously sending up all those musicals (Gilbert & Sullivan, Disney, Broadway, etc.) that helped inspire it. Never mind the foul language. It's exceptional parody, putting Broadway (and the monotonous drech that's passed for songwriting there the last two decades) to shame. Only the awful, uninspired rap tracks (likely insisted on by the financial powers-that-be) detract from an album that's overflowing with wit and originality. What were they thinking?! Would've been nice to have the song lyrics included with the liner notes, too, considering just how fast the music moves."
5,The funniest cd ever,This is the funniest cd ever... Even my mom and dad think its funny.... I liked south park before the movie but now i love it :)... I deffinitly recomend this cd to everyone.
4,"South Park track - bigger, longer, uncut, and EXCELLENT!!",This CD is definitely worth purchasing - it makes me laugh every time I listen to uncle f**ka - definitely the best trackm there.
5,This CD kicks ass,"Although track 16(probably the worst Kid Rock/Joe C. song ever made) and 14(saying f**k 44 times didn't really make up for the crappy song) sucked, and although the ""going to hell"" song wasn't on there, this CD still rocks. I wasn't a big South Park fan until I saw the movie and listened to this kick-ass CD. Buy it. its hilarious especially tracks 2,3, and 5"
4,Oh My God! They Killed Kenny,"Okay, so you saw the film and wet yourself - in fact, you're so addicted to it you invite your neighbours around for yet another South Park evening! Then, you put on the Soundtrack - day in, day out. But you put repeat on after track 12, solely because Terance & Philip sing ""Shut Your F-ing Face..."" rather better than those rappers! The soundtrack up to that point is amazing - my favourite being the show-stopping ""Up There"" and ""I'm Super""! You cannot help but love this soundtrack - I find myself hitting myself over the head at work because I can't stop singing the infuriatingly catchy words and music! If you have a CD recorder (as I do) then it's almost worth recording the best songs onto that and forget about those erm.... ""interpretations""! And it would have been good to know what the words are in some of the songs - like Cartman's. However, all in all, it's a fantastic soundtrack and a must for any true South Park fan! Here ends today's lesson!"
3,Very Musical!,"This is a funny CD! I can't deny that! I was expecting something else, i was kinda disappointed! It is like a musical from start to finish! Buy it if you are a die hard South Park fan, because otherwise you won't like it!"
3,"Ok Book, Too much theory not enough practical information",While Cohen did coin the term Computer Virus this book. This book little in the technical application of viruses. Lot on theory that requires a good knowledge of math to follow. While he tries to make light of the Virus problem he does stress it is a problem that must be dealt with. Though he seems to supporr the idea that knowledge of Comp. Virus is a better answer then allow users to blindly deal with viruses. This book would not help you make or even stop a virus. Unless you are solidly ground in math theory of Computer viruses and the use of this theoy in actaul code. This book is more for the Collector of books of this nature or the seroius student.
2,Plot does not deliver,"You would think with such a powerful cast..Jude Law, Rachel Weisz, Norah Jones and Natalie Portman that there would be a script that could complement their talents. Norah Jones is a woman trying to find herself and goes cross country before discovering that what she wanted was where she left it in NYC. Jude Law does nothing more than smoke a few cigarettes, wipe bar tables and serve Blueberry pie. This movie drags along and has a predictable ending. There are much better rentals than this one. Definitely do not buy!! Have you ever watched a romantic comedy that did not make you laugh? I'll never try Blueberry pie again!!"
3,Mystifying,"Can't help but notice that whereras Ms. Roberts' limited acting range has been noted, little if anything has been stated to justify her having been cast as 'Lizzie.' Ms. Portman would so have been more suitable to play the part, with her 'Leslie' character - for contrast - going to a Laura Dern, Martha Plimpton or Juliette Lewis. The physical resemblance between Roberts and Portman is distracting, unless it had been director Kar Wai Wong's intention to make it so in order for 'Lizzie' and us to become aware of 'Leslie's aimlessness, which alleged purpose, at any rate, cannot be said to have been adequately conveyed. Too uneven in several other regards, atmospheric cinematography included, except perhaps for Mr. Strathairn's contribution and the music."
3,wrong info,"This is not the 111 minute cut as advertised, this is the conventional cut, better off buying the region 1 version."
2,poorly made,"this was really disappointing, great cast, could have been a great romantic comedy but the lines were off, slow and terrible photography."
4,The Story,"Romance drama about a heart broken girl Elizabeth (Norah Jones) becoming friends with Jeremy (Jude Law), who is a restaurant owner. Norah is on the move to heal her heart, doing jobs to save enough money to buy a car, however she still keep in touch with Jude by sending him postcards. Norah became friends with several other characters while on the job,officer Arnie (David Strathairn), his wife Sue Lynne (Rachel Weisz) and poker player Leslie (Natalie Portman).Recommended featured songs The Story by Norah Jones and The Greatest by Cat Power."
5,My blueberry nights dvd,"If you like Nora Jones you will be sure to love this movie.Although she doesn't sing in this movie,she can act very well.It also stars Jude Law who does an excellent job of portraying a New York resturantier.I highly recommend this movie,it is very well put together."
3,Will not watch it again. Just bought it for curiosity for Nora's acting.,It's just an OK movie.It did not have enough of Nora's music.I would not recommend to anyone. Boring to me.
2,Should have trusted other reviews,"This movie was both depressing and boring. I love Norah Jones' music, but this has nothing to do with the music. The characters are not very engaging, and all of them sad."
3,Help with CE hours,We are using this to help with our departments conituning ed hours. It would be a good tool to use to help quiz you on your knowledge for the test but I wouldn't rely just on this book use your textbook and notes from class.
5,My Review,"My initial response to this product is that it will serve my purpose and do a good job of it. Using it on a bicycle you can use it to lock the wheels, seat and the bike but I would also use something like thisWinner International Ultra Bike Clubto lock the frame to something secure. The cable would be to easy to cut with cable cutters or a real good pair of sidecuts. But then again if someone wants it bad enough they will take it. For more added security I think if I was going to use it on my bike I would get the 3/8 cable lock like theMaster Lock 8413DPF Python Adjustable Locking Cable, 6-Foot x 3/8-InchBut since it is not going to be used on my bike it doesn't matter. Just remember that any cable lock can be cut without to much trouble, it just keeps people from walking away with your item. I'll post more later."
1,wanted familiar music,"My aquatic classes are mostly older people, so I thought this mid-tempo CD would fit the bill. Unfortunately it is too ""current"" for our taste. Other people looking for something that has new music may like this CD."
5,Works but with reality limitations.,This adapter is great and has a multitude of services. But the so called 328 feet range is questionable. I have my computer downstairs and the only place I can pickup a signal enough to surf the internet on or sync my PDA is in my room which is directly above my office. Other than that fact I am quite pleased with it.
3,Good product beware of incompatibilities.,I bought this Bluetooth device for a Symbol scanner. The range is good but the downfall is that it will rely on the Broadcom bluetooth stack AKA (WIDCOMM Bluetooth Software). The USB-250 will see your device but on some devices the software will throw its own security code mainly Human Interface Devices (HID). You can not set a default security code for HIDs you can do this on IVT Bluesoliel.Deepak Roy VijSenior Network EngineerThe Dot Printer Inc.
2,Uses Broadcom chipset--Less compatible,"This device uses the less compatible Broadcom chipset. The Cambridge Silicone Radio (CSR) chipset is a better choice, but more difficult to locate."
2,Never got it in time,"I can't review this product cause never got it in time, I paid 1 day shipping and it not arrived in time. I was at the hotel for 5 days. It arrived when a came back to home.Wasted money."
4,Hey. Nice dongle.,"This is a pretty good unit, strong signal, reliable, I use it with both my computers, and it pairs easily with our Motorola and LG phones, and my headset.The software could be a little cleaner, but once you get through the installation and convince Motorola Phone Tools to accept it, it's all good. The file transfer interface is nice, I can use Explorer to load songs onto the phone's microSD cards more easily than the proprietary apps would allow.Signal strength is a big factor; BT 2.0 is nice. I can leave my personal phone on my nightstand to charge, and sit in the other room sending songs to it."
4,"Easy Set-Up, Good Value","Range is very good. I've synced with Samsung, Nokia and LG phones. I've also synced a PC with a Mac.Bluetooth set-up was a little confusing... but I blame that on XP and learning a new protocol. The Anycom support forums were friendly and informative."
3,Anycom 250 I was expecting more...,"I bought the Anycom 250 about three week agos and using it constantly. There is really only one good thing about it, that it is very easy to install and get it to work with my phone(chocolate, VX8500) and HT820.My first complaint has to do with the range, I could only get barely 15 feet away before I loose the signal (this is a class 1) .2nd is support, I thought improve my range by upgrading the firmware on my adapter. I upgraded the fw and it caused more problems for me with the upgrade and could not get help from Anycom.Everything is back in working order now, but still very disappointed with the range. maybe I was expecting too much..."
2,"Beware, you may not be getting what you think","The reason for the low rating really has to do with Amazon and Electronica Direct (the supplier). My beef is as follows:The unit received is not the same as that shown in the photo. The shipped unit doesn't have the ability to swivel, which was one of the reasons I liked the USB-250.The supplier (Electronica Direct) charges outrageous shipping fees! Over $12 for an item that weights a couple ounces."
1,Doesn't work for my Hackintosh; bluetooth keyboard & magic trackpad,"The trackpad seems to work fine, a little bit of lag here and there. The keyboard was absolutely UNUSABLE. Key entries would take 3-10 seconds to appear on the screen and would often repeat 10+ times with one key-punch input. Initially thought it was interference with WIFI as bluetooth and WIFI both use the 2.4ghz band, but after shutting down the router, the problem persisted.This review pertains to:Apple Bluetooth Wireless Keyboard (purchased on amazon)Apple Bluetooth Magic Trackpad (purchased on amazon)Update (5/17/12):Bought a Rocketfish MRBTAD usb bluetooth adaptor. Works out of the box with both the keyboard and the trackpad. No software install necessary."
1,Installation of the software does not work atall and no support also,Waste of time and money... I have tried atleast 10 times trying to install the software from the CD that got shipped with the device.... no use. No support from the vendor...In the forum... looks like many people are already having the problem.... and the vendor has not made any attempt to resolve the issue....Strongly suggest to buy some other product...
1,worth 0 stars,"This item would not pair whatsoever with my motorola razr v3c. The kinamax support was very unhelpful. They did not try to troubleshoot and told me it just wasn't compatible. This device uses bluesoleil software to link to bluetooth devices. There is limited documentation with this software and no support. I bought a dlink bluetooth adapter which uses widcomm drivers and it worked within minutes, so spend $10 more and get the dlink adapter and save yourself the trouble I went through."
4,"A little sketchy on the software side, but otherwise fine.","I bought this BlueTooth adapter to go with my bluetooth headset for voice programs i.e. vent etc. I'm running windows xp pro, and I found the software that came with the adapter to be pretty bad though, kept freezing and crashing on me while trying to connect the headset (even though it would sometimes still work) I downloaded the most updated software of the website, problem solved. Detection and connection with my headset/phone is quick and simple. Add in the low price, and it's not a bad way to go."
1,Won't Work with VISTA!,"I got one of these to use with VISTA ultimate and a Plantronics headset. The install went OK, but everytime I connected the headset, it disconnected within 10 seconds. The only way to stay connected was to leave the connect dialog box open. Called Tech Support and spoke to a rep who I could barely understand (accent). He told me to upgrade the firmware and try again. The firmware upgrade program would not run under VISTA. I finally got it to run under XP, upgraded the firmware, took it back to my VISTA machine, and had the same problem. The rep also suggested I try newer (Beta) software, but when I tried to get it, it had been withdrawn from distribution.If you are running VISTA, watch out for this adapter; I'm returning mine after wasting several hours."
1,BT Dongle,Did not work without having to pay extra $25 for software. No one could tell me that Windows 7 has no drivers for any BT yet until the OS is further developed. Had to find that out in researching on Microsoft why device wouldn't work. Will just let dongle plug up a USB port until a time Microsoft releases a service pack with the driver.
5,Small and easy to install,This Bluetooth dongle was a breeze to install. I use it to stream music to my Bluetooth headphones. Works like a charm.
4,Works awesome with XP! and maybe Vista?,"I paired this with my MOTO H500 headset and my XP based desktop and it works great. I can walk into other rooms, about 100ft away. There is a new Vista driver I put on my laptop but I cant seem to get it to work. When I do, I will change my review to five stars."
2,"Kind of flakey, but newest software helps...","I bought this device for my laptop at work, but couldn't get it to work with Vista (even though the package says it will). After hours of frustration, I decided to take it home and install it on my home pc, running XP. Using the software on the disk that came with it, the installer continuously hung. Once I downloaded the latest XP software from the Anycom website, the installer ran perfectly. I have it paired with Philips headphones and the sound is pretty good. I don't know if it is the Anycom250 or the headphones, but the sound only works within 5 to 8 feet of the device..."
4,Great addition to my laptop,"Great product. Seamless integration with my laptop, smart phone and gps devices. Highly recommend. Would be nice if it were smaller."
2,"time wasted, no connection","It's entirely possible this product functions correctly. But after wasting almost an hour trying to set it up to sync my phone reliably I give up. Maybe the device is bad. Maybe the drivers are bad. Maybe the phone is bad. Maybe all three. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn't. Flip a coin. The software on the CD is bloatware and not useful. If you do get this product, just download the drivers and forget the rest."
1,BANKRUPT,"Anycom is no more, so getting support or updated drivers is impossible. The device is a rebranded Broadcom part with cosmetically branded firmware. It may be possible to flash it's firmware back to Broadcom or some other manufacturer but why bother?"
5,Works With XP SP2,I had a problem previously installing an older Bluetooth USB device on my XP SP2 system which lead me to buy this newer Bluetooh USB adapter. The Anycom works great. I followed the install instructions and haven't had a single issue. So far I've used it to talk to my bluetooth gps device as well as along with ActiveSync to talk to my Cingular 2123 smartphone. I've been impressed with the range as well I'm able to keep synced to my phone even when it's on the opposite side of the house approx. 25 ft.
5,Works for Mac OS X,I use this dongle with my Mac and it was fully plug and play. The computer immediately started looking for Bluetooth devices.Definitely recommended.
2,Sound Quality not good,"I just received this ANR-20 headphone. What I observed is it noise cancellation feature works fine but it fails in the sound quality. It sounds like a $5 headphone with poor bass and sound quality! Also no volume control on the headphone, uncomfortable for big head.Try some other noise canceling one...better to spend some 20 bucks more to get better sound quality!"
1,Not worth it,This thing doesn't do much. I think my traditional cheese grater does a better job than this. The funny thing is this doesn't cut well at all even for garnishing. Now this zester is just a clutter in my kitchen drawer.
5,The End of the World?,"It's not always an easy skill to make something so serious and scary, like the Revelation, into such a readable and enjoyable (and extremely funny, believe it or not) non-fiction book. I personally like his humour, particularly when he mocks the devil. But at the same time, he is also able to sustain the seriousness of the whole subject. Not only that. He can put the information in his book to such a readable level that, I believe, anyone can understand it. I would recommend this book to anyone who has interest in knowing about the Revelation, in a simpler version with MORE information."
5,Beautiful!,"This book touched me deeply, in ways that opened my heart up to the magick within myself. Regardless of what spiritual path you follow, this book is a must-read. It teaches you how to work through many aspects of yourself, in a beautiful, fairy-tale kind of way."
2,Too many cuts,"As a life-long nudist, I was very disappointed with the DVD compared with the theatrical release that I saw in the mid 1980s. The theatrical release opened with many shots of the nude beaches, and continued this theme quite simply and unashamedly throughout the whole movie. Many nude beach scenes have been deleted altogether from the DVD and the few remaining scenes are cut drastically, in my view detracting badly from the spirit and freedom of the Greek islands at the time portrayed in the original movie."
4,"Steamy, sexy, entertaining","I have watched this movie several times, and each time I enjoy it just as much. Could it be the sexy young partially clothed bodies...or the beautiful Greek surroundings...hmmmm... Whatever it is, it does the trick and brings a bit of 'zing' into my 30 year marriage!"
3,Guilty pleasure,"This film is a guilty pleasure. Being transported to sundrenched Greek Islands with bikini-clad female tourists on Greek beaches with a great 80's soundtrack will leave a smile om one's face. If one is looking for complex characterization and story-telling look elsewhere and stay away from this film. Story and character is as basic as it gets. The acting is limited by the simple nature of the dialogue. Basically this film is sunny montages of Santorini played to Pointer's sisters ""I'm So Excited"" that makes it a guilty experience. The three leads are extremely photogenic and easy to watch in this pleasant fluff."
1,I CANNOT believe so many people like this film!,"I can't believe anyone other than sex-and-nudity-obsessed teenage boys would like this film. I rented it only because I'm a Daryl Hannah fan, I wanted to see the Greek scenery, and I was curious about Valerie Quennessen, who died only a few years after making this film. But it was so idiotic I turned it off in the middle of the candle-wax scene (about 20 minutes in). A ten-year-old could write better dialogue than what's here. The movie is just an excuse to watch naked and semi-naked people cavorting in Greece -- period. Unless you thought ""Blue Lagoon"" was an intelligent film, skip it -- and if you want Greek scenery, rent ""For Your Eyes Only"" instead!"
1,typical Hollywood pap,"This stupid movie is typical Hollywood pap. Utterly unvbelieable and unrealstic situation and characters concocted by that master of phony sentimentality, Randall Kleiser, all for cheap titillation of the masses who buy into junk. ..."
1,NO! NO! NO!,"Okay - perhaps it's just because I've never been to Greece for a summer vacation, but I just don't *get* this movie or why there are actually people out there who have enjoyed it.The plot of this movie is so preposterous that the only reason I kept watching until the end was because I was hoping for some twist in the storyline that would salvage the film. Alas, the ending of the film was even worse than what I was anticipating halfway through. (C'mon - Lina on a moped at the end? ""Yes, I'd like my movie with extra extra cheese, please."")The only thing that made this film barable (barely!) was the scenery of the Greek Isles - which I admit was captured beautifully. (There's a lot of good early 80's-style nudity too if you like that kinda thing.) As for the story and the characters...The worst flick I've seen in a while."
1,"If I could give this movie 0 stars, I would","A mindnumbingly bad movie.The only thing that kept me watching was seeing if, at any time, a PLOT would actually develop.But there was no plot.Three ugly people hanging out, acting like idiots.What a terrible, terrible movie."
1,There is nothing normal in this movie,Summer lovers is a wierd movie with twisted love and wierd sex and threesomes all over the place. SEX is all over the place in this movie. I am really suprised they let a movie be made like this years ago even for the early 80's this is pretty morbid. This movie is morally wrong everything in it is bad. This has to be one the darkest wierdest movies I have seen in a while. The movie is in Santorini and all these actors are turning each other on while on vacation and having really messed up sex. I could not even eat after watching this is was so gross! There is even some gross guy near the end of the movie who is like 18 years old having sex with a 70 year old woman. The movie is shot is some ugly loft house made of stone it looks like a typical house just mainly built for having nasty sex. The ending was pretty stupit too if you watch this and are pretty much normal you will probably feel that something is seriously wrong with the love in this film.
4,'bout time....but...,"I saw this when it first came out. FANTASTIC!! I've been waiting a long time to get this movie on DVD. I had the VHS on my wish list to remind me to keep looking for it. Now it is finally on DVD but it is in STANDARD format not the original screen format. That blows! This is 2003, every film on DVD should be released in it's original format."
5,Total Guilty Pleasure,"I caught this movie on TV one afternoon, and just fell in love with it. Sure its mindless entertainment, but its absolutely intoxicating. The imagery of the Greek Islands and the beauty of the actors make this movie a rather guilty pleasure."
3,How Do I Get A Soundtrack of This Movie ! ! !,"It's enchanting. Sure there is sex, drama, it may even be a little cute... but it says, ""Don't we all take the drama of love a bit too seriously? Can't we find paradise in each other, love each other as friends as well as intimates. Plus before the trip is through let's dance the night away. It is not perverse...it inspired me as a young boy to go see the world and there is more out there and when I travel now I do with the same enthusiasm I felt in the movie. It was not the sex, it was the understanding. Who we are.The Greek's ask the question: Which are you Drinking? the water or the Wave? I wish to drink the Wave.. thanks for the opportunity."
5,Top 10 movie!,"If you were a teenager in the 80's, this is the movie you got to own. Nice story and shot on beautiful locations in Greece. Fantastic music from the 80's, and a very beautitul Daryl Hannah. Have a nice time ;-)"
5,"Great Movie, Great Sound Track (but out of print)","You can read my review a few lines down if you need to. I just wanted to let people know that I have digitally remastered the Sound Track from the LP, added many more songs from the movie, and burned it all to a CD. Contact me if interested. BigBlueC@bellsouth.net"
4,Watch it for the music,"The vision of the three lovers jumping off the cliff into the sea to the music of the Pointer Sisters and the vision of the Greek island they stayed in is what I remember best and what brings me back to the copy in my cabinet. I watch it for the great music and for the nostalgia of a young Darryl Hannah and Peter Gallagher. It was another time when things were more innocent. Inspiring to work out to. ""I'm so excited, I just can't hide it. I know, I know, I know, ..."""
3,interesting but shies away from the final step,"This is an interesting film in that it explores relationship dynamics--what happens when one half of a couple falls in love with a third person, but is still in love with the other half? These relationships do exist and work in the real world, but are rarely brought to the screen. Love, Jealousy, Fidelity, Surprise at the intensity of emotion--these things are here. I thought it was well done, and the scenery is stunning--a nice touch is how the island's history is shown off, and the natural beauty of the area.That said, I was disappointed in that we never actually see the three making love together, which I was hoping for. But the scenery and the emotional lead-up to the relationship between the three is well done. I am, however, glad I didn't pay more!"
3,great trip,"love this picture, It's my own trip to the greek islands (thanks to this movie I fell in love with Santorini so maybe one day I'll be flying the mediterranean sea to be right there!). It's a little bit cheesy movie but just love the great scenary."
3,Summer Classic,"Turn the brain off and view this one on auto-pilot. This 80's classic is escapism from begining to end. Cavorting beauties and stunning scenery make for a light viewing experience. Certainly one look here encourages us to chuck it all and ""go Greek."" I enjoyed the music and imagery. One of my personal favorites."
3,"Not bad, sun, sand, skin, and more moderately interesting.","This tale of three young people, set during a Greek vacation features some skin, by our three stars, and many others, and makes for a moderately interesting story. Hannah shows about as much as she does in the current issue of Playboy, the other one and the guy show some to keep things balance. It's a highly unusual realtionship. Some of the formatting may take away from some of the more revealing shots, but not much. Note, also, there's no accompanying book to this dvd; as with some, as I checked where I bought it from, not here."
2,ok,Don't get me wrong.I like this movie. It has potential. But the acting was horrible and plot is so predictable. The only good part in this movie is the other chick Valerie and the setting of Greece.
3,You will hate yourself in the morning,"SUMMER LOVERS provides an interesting take on the exploits of an unmarried couple vacationing where the swingers swing. Daryl Hannah shows just what happens when a woman gives it up to a man without a wedding ring (or even an engagement ring): her boyfriend (Peter Gallagher) takes even further advantage! He does nothing to hide his attraction to a single woman they meet; he beds her down and then brings Daryl in to make it a threesome. (Gals, what won't you do to please a man?) Daryl's character demonstrates a tickling fetish, and at one point ties the boyfriend down, arms over head, and tickles his underarms. She should have socked him in the face while she had the chance. SUMMER LOVERS came out right before AIDS became a household world. H.I.V., R.I.P., young people who see SUMMER LOVERS as a fantasy instead of a warning."
4,Not a bad final review kit.,"When I took the 70-270 exam about a year ago I had and abundance of study material, what I didn't have was a final prep tool to study from. This set of books is an excellent final tool but the timing is a little late.Both books cover each objectives and domains for the exam; however the areas of AD and group policies were a bit small as compared to the questions I had on my exam. The information is technically accurate and very up to date with the current exam.There are 2 books in the set and each one has a different set of exam questions, 1 with Prep Logic and the other with Measure UP. Both set of question are right in line with the exam, but I would add more questions to the mix.There are over 1000 questions in total, with over 500 in the Practice Questions book alone. Again timing is the major drawback and overall this is set of books has excellent explanations for the questions, which makes studying more than memorization."
1,Don't waste your money - or time!,The instructions - or complete lack thereof - make this gate a complete waste of time and money. I am reasonably good at putting stuff together (even Ikea products) but this piece of garbage not only has no useful instructions but no useful photos. The related Kidco round post adapter is equally bad. I will NEVER buy a product from this company again.
1,Worst instructions ever!!!,This product contains the worst assembly manual I have ever encountered in my life.Zero Stars.
1,No WinMe Driver Support,Product is not compatible with WinME and D-Link tech support was useless. Never did get the camera to work and had to return to vendor.
1,Not a great camera not great software,"I purchased this camera, I wanted to use it with Windows XP. I had a little trouble installing the software but I did get it to work. I was pretty disapointed with the software and the camera quality was not very good either. One would like the ability to control resolution and size of image the sofware I received really didn't support thse features."
2,NOT THE GREATEST QUALITY,"I own this camera, and when I got it, it had wonderful reviews. It's an o.k. camera, but I would recommend a different one. It's very slow and isn't caught up with the sound. The program that comes with it is confusing, and I still haven't figured it out. When I installed it, it didn't work at first because I forgot to put a floppy disk in it along with the CD. I got pretty ripped off!"
3,a good book 1st in the series of Sinclair Brothers,"I have enjoyed many of Melanie George's books and this was no exception. Its the first of three books about the devilish Sinclair brothers. This one is about the oldest brother Damien. He is a wicked, tall, handsom, rogue that takes on the job of teaching the innocent beauty ...We get to meet the other brothers briefly and we do gain insight on why the brothers are all ""devils"". I enjoyed the humor in this book so much that it had me chuckling out loud. The character of Reggie is perfect and quite a suprise. I really lok forward to the others in this series."
4,A fun read,"I read this book about a week ago and fell in love with it. I hadn't tried Melanie before this, but I'm glad I picked it up. Devil May Care is a light, fast paced read that kept me entertained from beginning to end. Wonderful story. Can't wait to get her next."
5,I LOVE THIS SHOW!,"Excellent show. As you get to know the characters in this series you can't pull yourself away. Lots of suspense,humor and great stories in every episode. Im not very good at writing reviews, all I can say is I love the show and only hope it stays on a very long time."
2,In Plain Sight-Season One,"We returned this after only watching part of the pilot. It's a very disappointing show. It has alot of language (in my opinion) and no plot at all. It was very slow, hard to follow and the main actress is trying a bit too hard to be the ""tough"" woman character. The characters don't flow well together. It's just a very hard pilot to get through. Maybe I just needed to give it more time, but I didn't really feel like it. I would let this one pass by and find a solid cop show to watch."
