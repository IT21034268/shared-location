1,Verbatim CD-R Problems,"I'm not usually one to write reviews, but I felt compelled to post a review because of the unbelievably frustrating problems I've had with trying to burn disc labels with this system. It comes with Sure Thing version 4se. Every time I try to print it locks up, won't recognize the media. I have only tried the Verbatim discs though. Do a google search on ""verbatim"" & ""lightscribe"" & ""problems"" and you will see for yourself."
2,"Unbalanced polemic, but useful as an entry level book","This book is a polemic, like James Bovard writes, but it is more speculative than Bovards' work since it is trying to predict the future. As such, it is suspect.The debate is whether old people can still be productive, and what this will do to the economy. Whether foreigners can buy US assets as the population ages. These issues are hard to predict, but the authors try and scare you into thinking they have the answers. A useful book but speculative.Save time by simply reading this article:The Economist (magazine), May 13, 2006 issue, p. 80, entitled ""Economic Focus: Baby Boom and Bust"". It cites both sides of the argument, taken up by Milken and Siegel."
3,Good Material but dated,I enjoyed reading this book. It has an excellent analysis of what's happening in our country. Its main shortcoming is that it is dated; a lot has happened including major increases in the National Debt. I would be interested in an update to this book by the authors reflecting the last 20+ months of economic change.
4,Overall quite good,"It's a good description of the most important issue of today. The authors seem very credible, though sometimes I wonder whether the statements may be affected by their biases. Often I was wanting more detail about the data and/or assumptions behind the numbers. Being very conservative fiscally, some of the prescriptions do not resonate with me. Overall, I feel the book is very worthwhile. I've just started their new book: Coming Generational Storm."
1,Self help finance book; but superseded by another book by the same authors,"I was looking for an analytical book on future demographics and how the impact will be felt in society. This book is very weak on demographics and almost immediately talks about practical advice both to the government and individuals. If this is what you require, maybe you will like the book. If you want a book that is a bit more analytical on demographics, so that you can draw your own conclusions, find another book.The book might be worth three stars if you are looking for this kind of book. However, it is only worth one star because the authors releasedThe Clash of Generations: Saving Ourselves, Our Kids, and Our Economyin 2012. The theme is the same; US is in effect bankrupt. Then a focus on the policy response as well as advice for individuals."
4,Scary- Good info. to know,"The author did a great job of making an important point, that we need to reform our Social Programs now or cause future generations much grief.Some sections of the book were heavy on taxation and economics, probably a little more than the average layman would understand. Also, the book had a heavy leaning on economics. I am a finance guy, I am concerned with cash flows. A lot of the calculations these guys did were opportunity costs and non-cash flow items, so take it with a grain of salt.The end product is a great warning with a decent measure of steps we can personally take to limit our exposure. There were several points throughout the book where I felt a little depressed for the future of our country, but I think that was their point."
2,only ok,"Like the previous review, the blade for shredding and chopping is too low allowing jams to occur. Also another problem I have is that it tends to be too hard to open the cover once I've used it. If you're on a very limited budget like me, it does the job, however I plan to replace this with a more expensive model at some point."
1,Replacement bowl/lid difficult to find and expensive.,"I have had this processor for about four years without complaint, until the handle cracked on the bowl, and the lid would no longer function correctly. The replacement bowl is about $27 with shipping. Planned obsolescence goes along with the purchase. For the money... and the name of Black and Decker, this product has become a disappointment."
5,Small Stir Fry Pan--Good Buy!,"This 9-Inch Calphalon Commercial Stainless Collector's Edition Stir Fry Pan is from the newest line of Calphalon Cookware, which is similar to the All-Clad LTD line. This pan could be used for a stir fry for one to two persons or as a saucier pan. I think it is an excellent try-me pan for this new line from Calphalon. It needs to be hand washed and dried to keep it looking like new."
3,pretty good stuff,"I bought this product at my sister's recommendation. It didn't seem to do much for my bust but make them smell nice. I did eventually smear some on my chin, just to see..why not?.. and low and behold, no more double chin. SO, i guess my bust is a little to ""busty"" to see any visible firmness or tightening, but it works for other things. And since people mostly see my chin, and they have commented on how ""slim"" my face looks, i have to give the product some credit."
2,Didn't notice anything,I used this product consistently for a month or so and I didn't notice a difference at all. It kind of had a funky smell too...
2,Umm... not for me.,"This was the biggest letdown I could've hoped for, like, ever. Yeah, it made my boobs all soft and stuff, but I was looking for something that would make them perkier because my boobs are of the persuasion that they needed to get bigger before I knew what to do with them as a teenager, so yeah. Large but not in charge, if you know what I mean? And I almost feel like this stuff made it worse, like the softening was anti-firming, for sure. Opposite of the description much?"
4,"Not a miracle, but helpful",I've noticed a tightening of the skin and combined with chest excercises you may notice a small lift if you're bust isn't too big.
2,havent seen much,"i been using this for a bit and havent seen much results. other reviews said to use and do chest exercise. which i have been doing. it says to apply twice a day i apply once a day cause i tend to forget. also i dont really like the smell of .. the cream has a thick feeling to it, which i dont really like either."
4,Works pretty well,This cream seems to be working but I have already used half of its contents and I am still waiting for better results.I will continue to use it until it's gone.
1,Negative,I was a full 34dd I used the product because I started working out to tone up and lose my stomach. I thought iit would tone up my breast firmness. I used the product one time I may have rubbed too much because a lot comes out but the next day my breast were loose no firmness felt real saggy. I am not happy and regret I ever used it. I am so uncomfortable going from feeling confident to not is real upsetting. When I now put on my bra that lifted my breast and gave me great cleavage with my boobs touching each other now they don't even touch. My breast feel mushy and light when at first they were heavy and firmer at first before use of product. I am now trying to see how I can enhance naturally and feel confident again.
3,Hm...,"I guess, this cream isn't something very helpful. It wasn't bad, it smells and feels good. But I wouldn't recommend it."
1,incomplete deliver,i ordered 19 pcs but only received 11pcs why ? palmers bust firming lotion deliver incomplete what happen to my order 19 pcs you deliver to me only 11pcs where is the rest ?
2,Paid too much,"I actually bought this locally and paid way too much, $625. The band is not as smooth on the edges as I would prefer making it uncomfortable to wear unless the band is made very loose, and the date to almost unreadable if you wear trifoculs as I do. It is also not particularly accurate. It was gaining a minute a day and the jeweler from whom I purchased it tweaked it to about 30 seconds a day. That said, it is an attractive watch and it might be worth a couple of hundred dollars. I wanted a Swiss movement and thought this would be a worthy watch but I have seen the movement on this watch selling for about $70 on line and I don't think it that great based on the time keeping I am seeing."
5,Great Cover,"I put this duvet cover on right away and am in love with it thus far. The buttons used to close it are securely sewn into the fabric. The flannel is warm and soft. The overall look of the cover is very pleasing to the eyes. I would recommend this cover to anyone who's looking for a nice duvet cover.It DOES make your bed more warm though, so I will be removing it soon as summer is right around the corner."
3,The lilacs are pretty,"The cover is as pictured, but is very thin. I bought it to cover my daughter's old pink and blue comforter and am now going to have to cover that first. But if you are covering a white comforter, it will be very pretty."
3,"Good dictionary, bad printing",It looks like the Quality control guy felt asleep on the job. I got a dictionary with missing pages and that felt apart easily.
5,WONDERFUL!,"I have been a garage sale shopper for YEARS, but this DVD taught me how to shop in a whole new way. I bought it because I am interested in garage saling for goods to sell on ebay, and Lynn taught me how to shop for that specific reason. Many great tips on things I just would not have known! What a pleasure to learn to shop from an antiques expert at such an inexpensive price!"
2,Not what I expected,"I got this locket as a gift for he holidays. When I got it I was shocked to say the least. First thing I noticed was the general look of the piece, which to be honest seemed off in comparison to the picture. The inside of the locket was the second thing. It was blank in the locket, just an ugly metallic look. Third thing that, in the end made me return the item, was clasp that held the door of the locket closed. To be blunt it didn't work. All in all I give the item a 2, only for the fact that it is technically a locket with pretty stones on it."
3,corkidorki,"I only gave this lamp 3 stars because I felt the quality was very lacking. The lamp is very sharp looking, love that aspect of it. But for how much I paid for it I was very disappionted in the construction of it. The swinging arm that holds the lamp isn`t mounted straight on the wall mount so the lamp looks crook-ed. Since it was bought early for Christmas and wasn`t put up till after, I figured the window to return it had passed. Maybe the crook-ed arm was just my bad luck."
1,Aroma could've done a better job on this,"This was my first rice cooker purchase and I was very disappointed. I followed the instructions and even rinsed the rice several times in an attempt to minimize/eliminate sticking. My first attempt yielded a layer of rice stuck to the bottom. The second attempt, I turned it to the ""warm"" setting when it looked done. Nothing stuck to the bottom but then the auto shut off feature is a waste as to get good rice, you have to ""baby sit"" the unit. Rather than having to pay shipping to return it, I shipped it to my sister who has far more patience than I. I ended up buying a Rival 6 cup cooker with a non-stick interior from Target. This unit came with a steamer basket that sits on top of the unit. $14 and it works great!!"
3,"For a college student, it gets the job done","This cooker takes good care of my rice-eating needs +plus+ the attachable steaming tray has encouraged me to eat more vegetables since they're now so easy to cook. This product is not top quality, the material of the pot is a bit cheap and it will only take about 2.5 cups of uncooked rice without suddenly decorating your table, but it definitely gets the job done. Hey, its definitely a step up from a pot and a stove."
4,What do you expect?,"I've had this for I think four years and it's never given me problem. I like how it makes the perfect amount for about three people and it never burns the rice. I've never had a prolem cooking Jasmine, brown, rice-a-roni, or sushi rice."
2,Advertised 6-cup; received 3-cup cooker,"Advertisement said it was a 6 cup cooker, but they sent a 3 cup cooker."
1,a piece of junk!,"Don't waste your money. I bought this because it was small and I wanted a rice cooker that would make 3 cups and take up less storage space than the bigger ones.It burns the rice every time no matter how much I adjust the water ratio. And brown rice - forget it, even more burned on the bottom. You have to watch it instead of being able to rely on it doing what it says it will do. It has yet to turn out 'perfect rice.'If I could rate this a zero I would."
1,Terrible and Cheap,"This rice cooker was terrible. The cook button would not stay down, and so I had to hold it until I thought the rice was done. I bought this unit at the nearby Target store, and I noticed a few others were returned as well. Avoid this rice cooker and get something better."
3,wrong product description,The product description states it is a six cup rice cooker but it is a THREE cup cooker.The product itself is good but the description is a misleading that should be avoid in any case.
2,Cheaply made,I bought this rice cooker because I wanted something small and all other ones I looked at are more appropriate for a family of ten. It is cheaply made and broke after less than a year of use.
2,Cooking Surface Comes Off,I have owned this product for 2-3 yrs and after using it 10+ times the cooking surface has began coming off into the rice. It will cook perfect rice if you know how to use it. Target- returns hah!
2,"Although scholarly, it's weak.","This book is sometimes so overly ""scholarly"" that you get lost. It would make a poor introduction book for those looking to get a basic understanding of Jewish sects in Jesus day. The translation is sometimes poor, leaving one confused. The order in which the author decides to present his material seems a little backwards. And if that wasn't enough, the author spends most of his time debunking others opinions on the matter, without really offering a true solution, reconstructing the contemporaries of Jesus. It's a painful book to read."
1,The coffeemaker from Hell.,"This is the coffeemaker we use at the office and we all hate it! It turns itself off repeatedly (usually 3- 4 times) before it finishes making a pot of coffee! When it's not failing to continuously brew a pot,it's overflowing all over the counter. It will overflow for no reason whatsoever. I swear if it's not one thing, it's the next. If you're looking for a coffee pot that allows you to walk away from it while it brews, this is not the pot for you."
1,This coffeemaker stinks !!,"First of all, the carafe doesn't keep coffee hot at all, just warm and barely warm after 2 hours. The water evaporates so much you barely get 8 cups out of it. Even when not submersing it when cleaning it, water gets inside the carafe between the plastic housing and the thermos glass. Then it leaks out slowly, with a dark moldy color. Also there is no ""off"" button...only an ""on"" button which is VERY easily bumped and then the brewing has to be stopped by unplugging the machine.I am completely dissatified with this coffeemaker and wish i had never bought it."
1,Leaky Carafe Kills Otherwise Great Coffee Maker,The carafe is the weak link in this coffee maker. I've had mine for about a year and coffee leaks from the top seal into the inside of the carafe liner. Everytime you pour some coffee the trapped liquid leaks out of the bottom seal and gets all over everything. There is no way to seal it up that I know of. I ended up drilling a hole in the bottom back side of the carafe to let the coffee drain out better then duct taped the hole to stop the leaking until I was over the sink to empty the leaky liquid. If you serve coffee to anyone in your living room make sure they are wearing their rubber underwear because they are going to end up with a lap full of yesterdays coffee.
3,Good coffeemaker - but you have to babysit it!,"I have been using this coffeemaker for over a year now. It does make a good cup of coffee, but we had to stop using the time set option (which allows you to get the pot ready the night before with an alarm which starts the brewing before you get up). There have been many occasions when the pot didn't fill and we ended up with a big coffee lake on the countertop. We're not really slow learners--we thought at first we hadn't positioned the pot correctly. However, even though we were careful about that, we still ended up with coffee everywhere. Then we thought that it might be that we'd tightened the top too tightly, which didn't allow the coffee to flow through. We still had the problem. We never did figure out why it overflowed; we just don't 'set it and forget it' anymore. I will probably replace this coffeemaker with a Bunn--if I have to wait until morning to make the coffee, I want it to brew quicker than it does with this one."
1,No Good,"This thing sucks; I have to stand there and keep pressing the on button every 30 seconds because it shuts off by itself. In order to brew a pot of coffee, I have to stand there and babysit. I was under the impression that refurbished meant that is had to pass the original manufactures' standards; I wasn't aware that it meant ""ha, ha good luck""."
2,Be very careful with this coffee maker.................,"I have the black/stainless version of this at work for 7 months now with no problem. We make coffee in the morning and rinse out the pot in our building's restroom before we go home. Then repeat the process the next day. However, I purchased this white version for home and by the 4th day, the interior lining exploded on us! Fortunately, my 3 year old son wasn't nearby. My advice is that if you are careful, this is a good coffeemaker. But you must be careful!"
2,What is the point...,..if the thermos doesn't keep the coffee warm. I wish we didn't have to throw our old coffee maker with themos away because of rusting on the bottom. After 7 years of use it still worked and kept the coffee very warm to hot up to five hours. This one barely kept it luke warm for two. A big dissapointment. The coffee tasted okay if you like it luke warm.
2,They sent me a subsitute,"I ordered this Dallas Cowboy's tire cover because I wanted one with just the Dallas Cowboy's star and this wasexactly what I was looking for...BUT...When it came in the mail,the tire cover had the blue star but also thewording ""Dallas Cowboys"".I didn't want the wording...Just the blue star...So I contacted them and they insistedthey sent me the right one until I copied and pasted the Amazon web page still listing the tire cover with justthe blue star, then they admitted they ran out of those and had to substitute with a tire cover that had thewording on it...They offered to refund my money if I sent it back to them, but since I already had it in hand,and I am a Cowboy fan,I put it in my SUV which is what they were counting on me doing I guess...I can understand when they run out of a item but I think I should have been contacted before they replaced it with something else to see if I would accept it .....Or not.Joe"
4,Spark is back,I've been married over twenty years and our sex life was pretty predictable and boring. These videos helped get some spark back in our marriage.
1,Outdated and out of touch - look elsewhere,"If you're looking for something that's informative stay clear of the classic better sex videos. The videos were made in the early 90's although they look like they were made more around the 80's. The information given was very minimal. You could probably put all the informative content of the whole series into about 15 minutes. I was very disappointed and thought it was a waste of time and money. But if you're interested in old 80's /90's type of semi-soft core porn under the thin guise of being informative then this is for you. I would be suprised if these so called ""doctors"" were real, because they seem to have as much knowledge of the subject matter as your neighbors teenage kid. Try to find something that is bit more current and more informative -- you could probably even learn more from a real porn movie than this series but I'm sure there are a lot of other, better instructional videos out there."
1,Full of Misinformation and Unauthorised Testimony,Be aware that this book is entirely compiled of statements and claims that are highly disapproved of by the man himself Martin McGuinness whom highly disapproved of the book's release.I was misled by a review I'd read of the book and mistook it for a fair coverage of the man McGuinness.I found this book to be tongue in cheek bias against it's claimed topic and not at all worthy of any attention whatsoever.Too many references not based in truths to mention.It is obviously a book to put McGuinness in a certain light and not at all to provide unbiased or balanced info.More a work of dogma about the figure of the man than anything of historically accurate value.A huge disappointment.
4,Good Second Book on SQL,"While I initially liked ""The Practical Sql Handbook : Using Structured Query Language"" better, after a couple of months I found this book in front of me more often. It is a little dry, but very good at explaining things like nested sub-queries, LIKE, EXISTS, and such. Several years later I had an employee working on an SQL parser in LEX/YACC and he found this book very helpful in definining the parser's syntax because of its conciseness. It doesn't go into the 31 flavors of SQL much, but those will be your third and n_th books anyway so not to worry. If I get away from SQL for awhile, (I'm really a C, C++ programmer) I hunt down Gruber's book before starting in again. If there's a better 2nd book out there, I haven't found it yet. You can't go wrong at the price."
5,Good intro to SQL syntax,"While the book was a little more elementary than I had hoped, it was still a very good introduction to the subject, and it certainly didn't hurt me any to review the underlying database theory. Nearly every chapter had stuff that would have saved me considerable work if I had just read the book two months earlier..."
4,"Not top-shelf, but still a good product","These are very durable jungle boots for the price, and are ideal for the purpose we got them, being able to survive wear and tear of the portages up in the Boundary Water Lakes of Northern Minnesota."
1,Horrible!,I received this item as a gift and ever since i started using it i have hated it. I truely think its a waste of money and i am returning it shortly. The original metal cover is plenty of protection and u actually have to take it off to use the leather case. If your looking for something like this buy something else this one is Horrible!
1,Is this a joke?,"This product was designed to protect the Jornada, but I think that it does more harm than good. To use it, you must remove the metal cover that is already on it, and the top of the leather case isn't nearly as durable as the metal. This is also drastically over priced and I would definately not recommend it. If you are looking for good protection from shock and weather, go with the Body Glove cases."
1,Dont waste your money,"This is a very lame product and it bugs me that HP has their name on it. It offers no protection for your Jornado, the button did not work on mine. the stylus is very hard to remove from the top of the case and it dosent really fit in the docking station very well."
4,Excellent Beginner/Intermediate Telescope,"After going through two very disappointing experiences with department store telescopes over the years, I decided to move up to something more capable. Yes, it cost more, but this telescope, especially when equipped with the optional 495 Autostar computer, is far more capable than others I tried. It is easy to setup out of the box and comes with an excellent tripod. The Autostar computer is easy to use and assists in finding all of the major planets, stars and other interesting items without numerous star charts to refer to. The optics are very good for a telescope of this price, but you do have to focus a lot after changing eyepieces. Views of the moon are simply incredible, views of Venus, Mars and Saturn very good. Highly recommended if this is all you can afford - as a first scope you wont be disappointed."
1,Broke after one use!,Bought it for my dad for Christmas. First time he used it this spring the whole saw part broke off. So dissapointed!
2,Don't try to adjust the blade,"It's a bow saw,and it cuts wood. Does the job. Blade is sharp enough and long enough. The saw is wide enough to go through most of what I need it for. If you are looking for something to grab and cut a piece of wood with. This works.If you want to replace the blade... this may not work well. If you are looking to adjust the tension of the blade, if you are looking to take care of your saw, and treat this as an investment. Invest your money elsewhere.I pulled the saw apart on day one, and barely got it back together without it falling apart on me. The pin at the handle side is extremely cheap. Actually, the tube is fine. The blade is fine. Everything else is sub par. There really is no way to adjust this saw. To replace the blade will be to risk destroying the saw.but it cuts wood, it does the job required."
2,"Must be for dry wood, or is a bad saw","Had difficulty cutting through small logs. Might be for dry wood only or just a bad saw blade--not sure. If you are cutting green wood, prob. best to look for something that specifically says it's for green wood. Also cut a little crooked too and 30 inch felt long.Handle seemed a little small too."
2,Broke within 2 minutes,"The price seemed good, and the first 2 small branches I sawed off cut easily. While cutting the third branch, a metal bolt holding the blade on broke through and the blade fell out. This basically made the saw worthless, since repairing it will cost more than the saw is worth."
5,"Strong, cheap, sharp... great tool","This thing is about as simple as it can get with a heck of a sharp pointy-toothed blade on it. It's got a tubular frame and is good and strong. If you've got the muscles, it's got the blade to saw thorough pretty much anything. I was using it to remove a volunteer palm tree which has gotten a little too exuberant for the space I have for it. So far the palm tree is winning, but this tool works infinitely better than any other hand saw I own. And it was CHEAP, less than the cost of a pound of decent coffee!"
3,"Functional, but not great","The blade on this saw has quite a bit of flex when using it sideways/at an angle. This makes it difficult to perform thrusting, cutting motions when you can't get the saw exactly horizontal (likely the case most times). The blade's metal is somewhat cheap feeling, with teeth that don't seem to grab real well. I used this to cut out some larger stumps from bushes, and it took longer then expected.I've bought other Fiskars gear that worked great, but I'd probably pass on this one and check out the local Sears instead."
4,Real journey,Please listen the Rumelaj first. Feel the gypsies and their women. It touches first your heart then your body and assume you are dancing with a gypsy lady!
5,Beautiful,"This CD is a must have for any Mormon Tabernacle Choir fans. The music is very reverent and gentle, and should also appeal to those not from the LDS church, seeing as how most of the music is common to the wider Christian community. This CD is a fantastic addition to any music collection."
2,over-arranged,"Although i very much liked an earlier CD of this choir, I was not too happy with this one. The arrangements have become so involved that it is just about impossible to recognize the the original melodies."
3,"A few bright spots, but also some disappointments","It Is Well With My Soul is one of my favorite-favorites and that is the main reason why I bought the CD; it turned out to be a huge let down on this album, they rearranged it so much that I almost didn't recognize it. Be Still My Soul is another reason why I bought it and it's good, but not great. Swing Low Sweet Chariot is where it starts to get good. The last two songs ""Thou Gracious God, Whose Mercy Lends""and ""Come, Let Us Anew"" are very good reasons to buy this CD, they each have truely powerful passages and make the CD worth having. The Mormon Tabernacle Choirs 2006 release entitled Then Sings My Soul is by far the best that I've heard from them."
3,nice and light,"A novel involving the 'lost generation' - that group of young people between the wars who seemed to spend their time, drinking partying and proposing to any female who would listen.The synopsis to this edition has this absurdity to say "" Nobody, not even Evelyn Waugh has done the British ""lost generation"" better than Anthony Powell.......""Well, I have to disagree, this is a poor mans ""Vile Bodies"" - at this stage of his writing career Powell was not even close to Waugh and as this was published a year after 'Vile Bodies"" the conclusion is that Powell pretty much copied Waugh's scenario. This story has some very funny moments, the chapter at Pringle's country house is very clever, but overall not as consistent as the mighty Waugh at this age.Worth reading, its light and short but if you read Powell go in boots and all to his twelve volume masterpiece "" Dance to the Music of Time"" then you will be reading a novelist that is the equal of Waugh."
4,My favorite singer,"This a small collection of 14 lovely songs. Nostalgic; one could say ""no one sings like this anymore"". I love to hear songs well known as Sinatra's, in a little different interpretation. I can't say which is ""better"" - it is just a matter of personal taste.And I like them all equally! This is music for somewhat older people, like myself, for many pleasant moments."
2,Michele,"Light weight, a little flimsy, don't expect it to last long. But, what the heck, it didn't cost that much. Any skillet with nonstick coating never lasts anyway so why spend a lot of money."
1,Found for free via internet search,"For grins, I had searched for one of these electronic articles on the internet, and I found it, for free! So I did the same for this one. Same results (different site had this one).As I expressed in the other review, this feels, to me, too much like relatively expensively priced items at a convenience store, except the only ""convenience"" is saving a few key strokes, and there isn't much information on what you are actually getting. The instant access via a digital vault makes it tempting to do the convenient one-click, and hand over your $5.95."
5,Corkscrew for everyone!!,This product works flawlessly - no more problems with corks (natural and synthetic). I replaced one that had worked great for over 10 years.
2,Disappointed,I was somewhat disappointed with the book as I expected more discussion about how to implement chess strategy.
2,Makes a nice Log for Fire...,"When the fire was about to die, and no logs were left. I looked around the house for something I could toss on. Lucky for me I still had a copy of this book. I would of given this book 1 star, but it burned rather well. Honestly this book is just a bit below average. There are much better starter books to help your chess. The Mammoth Book of Chess and Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess just to name a few... Also perhaps just getting a good puzzle book like the one from John Emms. The huge Chess book from Polgar would be a wiser choice. Least the price is not bad if you insist on buying this book."
2,Had my hops up,"First of all, I love this dancer and I was so excited to get my hands on my first Tamalyn DVD. It wasn't at all what I expected. There aren't very many moves for technique options or Choreographies. I also just found a vintageVHS tape by her called ""Serious Belly dance"" which almost identical in moves, but gives more variety and is worth having if you can find one.This DVD really seems rushed and not very well put together. Almost looks like it was done last minute. This doesn't change the fact that she is a beautiful dancer and her students also. Maybe a re-release of this DVD would be nice"
2,"Not worthless, but don't bother buying the workbooks.","This book was recommended to us by several friends and my mother, so we bought and read it. I would have been happier had I borrowed it from the library and not spent the money. It has some good common-sense suggestions to keep a relationship working, but nothing earth-shattering. The only things I found really helpful were the triangular model of relationships and the chapter on ebb and flow. Other than that, if you've taken Psychology 101 this book has nothing new for you. Also, I was very disappointed in the workbooks. The book makes you feel like you are missing out if you don't stop every few paragraphs to do an exercise in the workbook, but the workbook is exceptionally lame and consists mostly of empty lines and questions that are obvious to the reader anyway-- definitely not worth $14 extra. If you want a really fantastic marriage book, try ""I Pledge You My Troth"" by James Olthuis, if you can find it."
5,Great gizmo,"This little item is great.I cook a lot of rice so I though why not get a rice cooker? Turns out, I steam just about everything now. I am still trying to perfect the flavoring part and trying to find a good steamer book. But for the most part I love this rice cooker.The instruction book tells you how much water and time to use for just about anything you'd want to have steamed, from vegetable to rice to meats.And the price is really great too. When I was first looking at steamers, I though I'd have to spend close to $100 to get a decent one. Well no! $30.. How nice?"
1,Steamer Failure,"After using this steamer for asparagus exactly 3 times (it worked fine), the fourth time it would turn on, but then about 10 to 30 seconds later just shut off. Also, the timer device seemed laborious, having to count back from the 45 minutes - or choose an item that very generically matches your item (like 'vegetables'). Do I need to say I don't recommend this steamer to anyone!"
1,piece of trash,"My steamer is exactly 5 months old, used only 4 times and no longer works...can one find any appliance NOT MADE IN CHINA? My last steamer was 15 years old before it gave out......"
5,"Great Steamer, Easy to Use, Fantastic Steamed Vegies","Highly recommend this the Black & Decker Steamer. It's a vital part my kitchen rendering perfectly cooked carrots, broccolli and other favorite vegetables. Its been very reliable and rugid. Over the years I owned two of them, they eventually wear out or you find a way to break it like me.The negative review that slamed about an electrical problem seems very far fetched to me, I tossed mine around quite a bit and it never had any issues of any kind. I've always got my $29 out of it. Its simple to use and does a great job, you can't go wrong, I highly recommend it !"
3,Another White Plastic Cabinet-dweller,Just buy a stainless steel steamer thingy for pots and be done with it. I didn't find that this did the job any better or faster. Carrots stain the plastic forever.
5,Best Steamer,I had an almost identical steamer from Black & Decker purchased around 1985. The lid on that one finally broke and I've been looking for one like it for 2 years. Nice to see a good design hasn't been changed. Love the steamer!
4,best broccoli ever,"boiling broccoli always adds a ton of water and makes it super soggy, but this is the best way to cook broccoli (and other things of course...) I would definately recommend this product. The only downfall is that it's pretty big and we have NO couter space, so it makes it difficult to store it and make room for it."
1,Cooking with Plastic,"I've had one that worked well for over 15 years since they were first introduced. Good technique or oven mitts are needed when lifting the lid while it is steaming or you will get scalded. The recent health news regarding BPA in hard plastic drinking bottles got me to stop using it. I can't imagine how accelerated the leaching of this chemical might be by cooking in it. At minimum if you still care to cook in plastic, I'd recommend you find out if it is BPA free. I do suffer some of the listed symptoms related to BPA exposure."
4,great product... though the flavor scentor is (IMHO) useless,"Honestly, I love this steamer. I use it at work in my cube. It's very easy to use; just fill with water, drop in your veggies and go. I have found, however that most of the time I want to do rice and veggies at the same time. I take a separate disposable plastic bowl (like the Ziplock ones) and put the water and rice in that. I let it work for 30+ minutes and then throw in my veggies around it. Works every time. I've tried to use the flavor scenter several times and have found that the herbs tend to get sticky and clump up as the steam is passing through, oftentimes causing the steam to not make it to the veggie container. So I typically will season afterwards.On other thing of note... be careful taking the lid off, I ended up with burns three days in a row because of escaping steam. =("
1,UGLIEST BRATZ DOLL!,Tis is the ugliest bratz doll i've ever seen!Her shoes are to pointy her clors are hideous and her hair is too light!Yasmin and Sasha are the prettiest compared to that!Please don't make another ugly bratz doll like this ever again!
3,it's okay,"my 7 year old finished this game in a couple hours! Super easy, but he seemed to enjoy it."
1,Forget About It!,Shrek looks uglier then an ogre should in this game. The movements of the characters is VERY inaccurate.
2,Good while it lasted,"I loved this wine cooler until it died on me me. It continues to click like the temperature is trying to adjust, but it is not cooling at all. The LED lights work, but that is about it. I received it as a gift about three years ago. I've been researching getting it repaired, but it seems to be more expensive than the product itself."
2,"Another - ""Good while it lasts""","I've had mine for about 2 years with no complaints at all. Yes, the temperature fluctuates a little too much, and yes it does make a (quiet) gurgling sound, but for the price you can't do better. Until the other day when I noticed that the unit had shut itself off completely. It's plugged in, but it's not getting any power. No LED, no interior light, no gurgling sound.I tested the outlet, and it's fine. So, I'm assuming it's a short in the wiring, or perhaps a blown fuse in the unit itself. Whatever, I now need to empty the unit of the wine, and lug it to the service center where they'll try to determine what happened."
4,Great Product for a limited space and budget!,"After doing a bit of research on wine cellars, I purchased one of these. It is great for a small Manhattan apartment. It easily takes 30 bottles, you can even squeze two more. It definitly makes the wine taste much better and makes it last longer. I love the digital read out. It usualy stays at 55*-60* for red wine. It has auto settings also a manual temp setting. Very quiet and stylish. Top of the cellar is a non-skid surface so you can serve wine by placing the glasses and bottles even they are wet. I am a proud owner of this two month old wine cellar. Hopefully I will stay proud for the rest of its life."
3,Important Point to Consider Before Purchase!,"NOTE:Haier no longer seems to be doing business in the U.S. I wouldn't buy their remaining products as they won't be around to service them or get parts or things.ORIGINAL REVIEW:This model does not feature UV protection on the glass door so it's useless for storing wine long term except in a garage or basement. If you plan on installing in your kitchen, get something else with UV protection. Haier has a higher end model that does feature UV glass. Too bad because I think it's very stylish and understated and actually nicer looking than the higher end model.The main thing to remember here is that you need to either situate this in a dark place (a basement would be better than a garage since your electric bill will be less) or you need to plan on using it only for short-term wine storage -- very important fact to remember in deciding on models to purchase."
2,Good... while it lasts,"I bought this for my wife less than two years ago and it has been in one place the whole time. Up until last night, it worked fine.Last night I noticed that the temperature (normally restricted from 45 - 60 degrees) had dropped to 23 degrees. Despite efforts to ""reset"" the temperature, it still kept chilling. It must be the thermostat, but the warranty is for only one year (except for the compressor, which is 5 years).The nearest authorized service center is 30 miles away, so the time and cost of repair makes me want to warn others that:This is a good unit, but I would look for something with a longer warranty. Under two years of service is pretty grim for the cost of this item.Update: Unplugging the unit overnight and placing towels to soak up melted ice seems to have corrected the problem. I upgraded my rating to only three stars, since the manufacturer did not suggest this to me.Update: The above update only temporarily ""fixed"" the problem. Find another brand/model"
1,BAD CUSTOMER SUPPORT,I have been in the IT business for many years and I have never talk to a more incompetent customer service. First their english (I was forward to support in India) was so bad that they could not take the information to provide a RMA for a return for a faulty HUB. After three calls I finally gave up and ate the cost of the HUB. There is no reason to pay this much for a product without support. My suggestion is to buy the cheapest one and throw it out when it fails.
1,Amazon is Lying,"They claim this product ships in 3-5 days. It doesn't. It doesn't even ship after the extra 3-5 days for super saving shipping. I ordered this product on 10/10/05 and it still hasn't shipped. And they won't let you change the order, even though I have received three messages stating that I ""may be able to."" Customer service claims it is ""in the shipping process"" which is clearly a lie. Don't buy it."
5,Perfect SOHO solution,"For handling a Netgear router, two machines and a print server, this is the best option for the price. Price aside, a totally dependable product. I expect to see a lot more Netgear equipment in my home. Oh, and the case actually looks nice, unlike 3Com and most other manufacturers' boxes."
5,"Very Nice Unit, Works Excellent, Simple To Install",This is a great hub. Work well. This is part of my first network that I installed myself. I used all Netgear compnents and I am pleased with the simplicity of the installation. Just plug and go. I do recommend the Netgear FA310TX Nic's also.
4,Well Presented Text,"I'm gearing this review more toward the quality of the book and editorial accompaniments than to Askew's text itself. I used this version in a Graduate English course and wrote a seminar paper with this as my primary version of the text. The text is presented well, with clear lines between Askew's text and John Bale's editorial comments. The introduction is useful.The book is part of the Women Writer's in English series, and because of that, in my opinion it's a little too focused on the women's study angle. John Bale published Askew's account in the context of a particular political situation and in response to specific attacks from the English Bishop Gardner. That being said, there isn't a version that contains all of that information.Hopefully someday there's a larger version of Askew published with additional editorial content, but for now, this is the best available and it's not bad at all."
3,cute but cracked!,"My little hula girl is so cute but when she arrived she was cracked! Both of her ankles were cracked and she didnt stay on the stand very well either. Meaning when she wiggles she falls off the stand, from her waist down just toppels right over! My husband used super glue to fix her ankles and he ended up gluing her waist that jiggles to the stand. Like I say, it is cute but she was cracked...."
4,Everyone needs a Bobble-Head,"Fun, whimsicle and definitely part of the American persona! Everyone needs a bobble-head..in my case, a Hula Dancer!This dancer was delivered in fine time, excellent condition and was everything anticipated when the order was placed. She is simply stunning on my dashboard, particularly when the skys grow dark and snowflakes make their way past my windshield...and I find myself wishing I was sitting on the beautiful white sand of the Hawaiian Islands.Marti MelvilleAuthor of ""Deja vu: Farriage""[...]"
3,Hula girl,"Sheis very stiff and doesn't move as much as others I have seen. It's a big ""just ok"" for me."
3,Nice but . . . .,"The doll looks great, awesome hula skirt, bobbles just the way I expected, but the doll cracked around the ankles all the way around in shipment. Should have been shipped in a form fitted styrafoam. I had to glue it all the way around in hopes of it not breaking, taking away from it's beauty."
1,NOT AT ALL WHAT I ORDERED,This product shows a different picture than the hula girl that received in the mail. It was very disappointing knowing that the picture is that off from the product they were selling and I read other reviews saying the same thing.
2,just for your info,"this product is OK for networking under 50 feet, i had the previous version which is the EN104 (NOT EN104tp) with the bnc port, that one work for my home networking, but when i bought this one DONT WORK, called cust support and he said its a diffrent chip inside that couldnt handle that far of a distance, i thought just to let you people know about this."
4,Good for a 10Mbps Hub...,"I must say that for a simple non-switched 10Mbps Ethernet hub, this one is pretty good. The metal box and small size makes it pretty handy. Unfortunately it's pretty outdated for the things you can buy for a few more bucks. You're probably better spending your money on a Linksys EtherFast 5-port Worgroup Switch, which has a dedicated 100Mbps (or 200Mbps in full-duplex mode) of bandwidth in each port.... But if you're adament about a plain 10Mbps hub, this is a very good way to go."
5,What else can you ask for?,"For just a simple 10 Mbps hub, this is an excellent one for the price. It is compact and sturdy, especially with the metal casing. Link and status lights are handy along with the Normal/Uplink switch. No software installation needed - plug the power in and the CAT cables and you're all set!"
3,One problem I've noticed with these,"One problem that I have had with this model is with the power supply connection on the back. It doesn't seem to be made very well, and if you press too hard on the plug, the power will actually cut off. I had my hub on the floor under the desk, and sometimes my foot would press the back of it up against the wall and the power would go out momentarily."
2,great at the beginning and unreliable at the end,"This little hub made by Bay Networks (part of Nortel Networks) proved unreliable after about one and a half month of use. Lately, files won't transfer right and sometimes they won't even transfer. I ended up borrowing my friend's switch to complete the job. Not a good choice!"
4,Just wish it was cheaper,"A great hub that allows you to share an uplink onto another network with 3 computers or have a local network of 4 computers. Either way, the hub has been very reliable and performance has been as promised. Netgear is known for making quality Ethernet products and this is just another one of them."
1,Lifetime Warranty is a Lie,"The manual and information all says this product has a lifetime warranty on the hub. However, Netgear said the product is too old so they are not honoring their lifetime warranty.Netgear is running a scam. Apparently their ""lifetime"" warranties only really mean a few years. I will never buy another Netgear product again."
4,Great for Home Network!,I have bought two of these for home and office use. They work flawlessy and for the price you cannot beat the functionality. I was running at least Windows 98 on all computers I hooked up to the ethernet hub. Windows makes it easy to set up file and printer sharing.After you are hooked up to a network you will not need to swap disks all the time in order to exchange information or to move files for printing. You can transfer a hundred megabytes in a minute or two depending on the kinds of files.Setup is a breeze if you have ethernet cards installed already. Even if you do not have cards installed already there are instructions to walk you through step by step.
3,Is this Hub able to connect An Xbox360 to a computer,I was wondering if this hub would connect the Xbox 360 to my computer because the xbox360 comes with an ethernet cable but my computer only has one and it is allready being used by my cable modem.
4,Modern,"The lads (and lasses) who reviewed this so far seem to have little common ground on which to stand. Some thought the second half picked up while one disjointed and rather cryptic email loved the first half, and another hated all the songs by ""Spedding"" (which may be a reference to Chris Spedding who has absolutely nothing to do with the Buzzcocks). I'm sure that lad meant Diggle. As it turns out, they're all wrong. ""Modern"" may not be modern but it is certainly the best product they've made since they ""regrouped."" Most notable is the improvement Diggle shows. His songs are as good as they used to be (before the awful material he provided TTT). Actually, it shouldn't be too much of a surprise given the progress he demonstrated on ""All Set."" Fools will complain that this is not the old Buzzcocks. Of course not. It is still the best Buzzcock album since 1979. And it's quite good, for that matter. In fact,I was genuinely surprised just how good it turned out to be."
2,"Well, it's not that modern.","""Modern"" usually sounds like some outdated mid-80s new wave album by the Cars, Flock of Seagulls, or somesuch. It is not a punk record, mostly midtempo pop. The three songs Diggle wrote and sings on are basically awful; Shelley's are considerably better - the usual wry lyrics and great hooks. I would say about 3 or 4 of the tunes are topnotch Buzzcocks stuff; newbies should buy ""Operator's Manual"" or ""Going Steady."" Or dig up the amazing ""Different Kind of Tension"" from a used record store somewhere! Also, see them live if you have a chance."
2,Bollocks to this,"This ranks right up there with the Blondie reunion CD as completely unnecessary. Why? These guys are RELICS. And I wouldn't care if the music was great (i.e. Joe Strummer & The Mescaleros new stuff) but this is just awful. Why are they still trying to act like jittery teenagers? And the Spedding songs here are just wretched, at least the Shelley-penned numbers are merely bad. By all means, buy Singles Going Steady or Operator's Manual, as they are priceless landmarks of punk rock, but leave this Modern dreck in the rubbish tin. I picked it up for half-price and should have known better."
3,OK but preservatives may spoil taste for some,"These are ok. They are sweet and chewy but the sulfur dioxide may leave a funny aftertaste for some. They are pretty expensive too. I use to use these for oatmeal but tried other dried apples without sulfur dioxide and the unpreserved ones taste superior, and they are cheaper."
4,"Four stars for music, but REMOVE THE COPY PROTECTION","For Marisa fans, this is an absolutely beautiful album. I've listened to it many times weekly since I purchased it. I highly recommend it, WITH reservations. I went through serious torture just getting it into mp3 format to play on my iPod. If anyone would like instructions on how to circumvent this lame copy protection scheme in order to play this music on a different medium-within the scope of the license you purchase with the music-please email me and I'll be glad to share how to do it. This is a classic example of publishing companies gone too far. If Marisa's next album comes out with EMI copy protection, I will be forced to stop recommending her music."
1,"my PC runs real slow now, ipod doesn't work","It didn't play in my 4 yr old stereo system (Pioneer TX-970). So, I put it in my PC. You must accept some weird agreements about some software that will be installed. So I did. The music played but I could hear clicks every so often. I tried to remove the software but no way. And I couldn't get this onto my ipod. Now I'm stuck with this junk CD.What a nightmare, avoid like plague!"
3,"I may be MM's biggest fan, but this album doesn't thrill","Honestly, Infinito Particular isn't her best work. I would put it on par with ""Mais"". It does not being to compare with ""Memorias..."" or ""Cor De Rosa..."" By no means is this a bad album, but it doesn't have any tracks that stand out. There are no Magalabares, Diariamentes, Maria de Verdades, or even a Nao Va Embora type track on this album. I only give it three stars because I am such a huge MM fan, and after such a long wait, we got two mediocre albums, when I was hoping for something that would dominate my IPod for the next few years."
1,"If you don't want to have a big headache, stay away from this CD!!","I will never know how good or bad these 2 CDS really are unless a version that will not mess with my computer is released. EMI decided to ignore the problems that Sony BMG ran into, and made it even worse. Knowing what I am up against, and considering that I listen to music for pleasure, I will keep the integrity of my computer and my money as well. They can keep their product. One of these days, if educated consumers send a strong message, the record industry will understand the concept of fair use. I am never buying a CD from a company that does this."
1,Boycott anti-piracy software!!!!!!!!!!!,"I am a longtime MM fan, and have all her CDs. But I absolutely refuse to buy these 2 after reading these reviews. The last time I tried to load Cds with copy-protecting software, it froze my computer just like people say in the reviews.Darn it, Marisa, why did you do this????"
2,Ho Hum,"Unmemorable. Marisa Monte has lost her edge. She still has that beautiful voice, but these songs are flat little diddies she probably sings in the shower. They have no power, no staying power, and they are clearly not a challenge to her vocally or artistically. Pass."
4,And adults like it too!,"My 4 1/2-year-old likes the book a lot; it's a little difficult for him, but it's a great activity for us to do together. And I enjoy the fun, detailed pictures in the mazes. I'll be buying more of the Snapes mazes for his 5th birthday."
5,aMAZEing Book!,"This is not only a book of challenging mazes, it is like entering a magical world. Especially engaging for young children who become completely absorbed in the fantastic illustrations and visual adventures."
5,"Very good, for a gardening book with no pictures.","This helped me sort out my own list for what I want in my garden, and what I want to get out of it. Information is to the point. Experienced gardeners/designers/nursery professionals sharing their choices, all simply stated.Without the positive reviews on this book, I might have passed it over. Nice one to have on the shelf."
1,Waste of Money,"This book was a total waste. There is not one picture in the book. The book has lists of groundcovers, trees, etc.and where they grow best.171 pages of lists. Am I supposed to look up the thousands of plants listed here to see what they look like?"
5,This is ridiculous,"Why is this album not better known? Buy it. It's worth paying the shipping and handling to spend as low as 45 cents. It rocks. It pops. It grows on you. This band is one of those that slips through the cracks somehow of mainstream and indie press and music history. Someday. Hopefully, sooner than later.I like this one the best."
5,So simple to use..,"This moisture meter is so easy to use!!I do not know how i got by without it..Made to last and no more guess work on watering my plants,The price is right also.I love buying from Bonsai Boy's,Will be buying more soon.."
2,New Baby for New Years!,"After visiting my ""lucky"" Toys 'R Us, I found the Simpsons New Years Playset (3 of 'em!) on the top shelf of the action figure aisle. After bringing it home, I got a chance to really check it out. It is great to have voices from the entire family available at the press of a button. The whole family looks very spiffy in their holiday best. What I really like is the fact that the year 2003 is prominently displayed across the entire top of the playset. As a Simpsons/Playmates collector, I know these sets are hard to come by, but one word of advice to those of you still looking for it--DON'T GIVE UP! This is definitely one set to have at any cost!"
4,Simpsons Times Square 5-Pack,I really like this toy. The whole family in one set! Who could ask for more. The figures are done up nice with some great lines. Marge looks like a million bucks. Homer and Bart as Gentlemen???? I guess Marge dressed them. Lisa in a red dress and Maggie with her party hat. Pass out the noise makers and lets bring in the New Year. It even has a picture of Barney in a diaper as the New Years baby in the back ground for a good laugh. Hope no one has to change him!!!!! A must for ANY Simpsons collection. Keep up the good work and great ideas.
5,Works great!,"These attachments for the Villa Ware strainer are great and so easy to use. They take all the work out of making salsa, canning applesauce, making fruit jams, and so much more! Easty to clean, too."
1,A Waste of Money,Not one of the wisest investments in chess. Chess terms are learned through exposure and study. This book is unnecessary for chess players at any level. There are better chess books out there.
2,Barely adequate book of concepts,"This book contains an A to Z listing of chess terms, definitions, concepts, slang terminology, names of special checkmating positions, amongst other things.I have the sense that this book was a hack job, slapped together in order to make a quick buck. (Look, writing chess books for a living is a tough job.) This book is adequate, but not much more than that.I bought this book from the ""remainder"" section of my bookstore, and paid well beneath list price for this book. Had this book been sold at list price, I would not have bought it.This book may very well be available at your local library. It's the type of book that would seem to fit the needs of a general library population. I would recommend inquiring at your library before buying this book.'Chess Thinking' might be useful for beginners who are not conversant with chess terminology. Also reluctantly recommended for chess instructors (to have as a ready reference for students.)"
1,Hang it up !,"By now Mr Pandolfini must know that his chess playing skills and success as a chess coach will never carry over to his writing skills. He throws together random lines of useless material...gets it published by Fireside Chess Library and gets a nice paycheck...he has this down to a science. The purpose of his books is to transfer money from your pocket to his. If you don't agree with me, do a search of just his books here on Amazon and read the reviews.If you click on my name you will get my personal information and see a recommended study list. I put together this list of books and software with only one thing in mind...to improve your game without wasting your money. If you want to get better at chess this list will give you the most bang for your buck."
5,Great product - does what it was designed for.,"Great product - does what it was designed for. Fairly easy cleanup -- Remember to ONLY use non-stick cooking tools with it to preserve its life. Purchased this because of value and price. Lightweight and easy to toss into sink and wash. Also serves as a stove-top defrosting pan for frozen meats. Usage tips -- 1) When running 2 burners under it in high heat, it Will get plenty hot for grilling steaks, burgers, etc. -- you may have to shorten your cooking time; 2) Of course, produces plenty of smoke - Should be used with a vented, high-powered range hood; 3) Be prepared for grease spatter around the cooking area; and 4)It Will bake grease onto the stove top surface - clean off with ""Easy-Off"" Oven spray. Bought this to use in place of an electric grill, which I found was heating too unevenly and with insufficient heat to grill steaks, etc."
4,very light compared to cast iron,"this is cast aluminum, not cast iron. The weight therefor is significantly reduced. it weighs only 3lbs! very light. other cast aluminum i saw weighed 6lbs. Unfortunately i have to return this because it's a bit short for my grate. My grate is 20 inches, this is 19.5. The description says 19 but it's actually closer to 19.5; i measured it. i need one at least 20 inches to encompass my grate. Aside from that i would recommend this product. It's not as good as cast iron when it comes to heat conduction and non-stickiness but just google how to coat cast aluminum correctly and this should do the job. also remember this is much cheaper and way lighter."
3,Well-made puppet..hardly used,"Though it is a very good quality puppet, on the order of Folkmanis puppets, this puppet did not hold the interest of my child (then 7 years old). We bought it after she had seen the puppet on a movie and developed an attachment to the character. Has scarcely seen any playtime, however. One reason for this may be the fact that it is difficult to manipulate both the stick that controls one of the arms with a pom-pom AND the puppet itself (with moving mouth). This is an especially tall task for little ones. Appropriate, I would think, for older children with special needs for role playing - especially other puppets in the line (doctor, policeman, construction worker, chef, fireman, etc)."
4,Recipe and Wine advice for a home chef,"Ming's show has a great concept - create a master sauce/dish and expand upon it to make several different delicious dishes.The wine pairing advice for each dish adds value, especially for the home chef looking for some great dinner party inpsiration.Ming sure likes his Sauvignon Blanc, so if you enjoy SB, you will love Ming's dishes!Kathleen Lisson"
5,Really Simple and Delicious,"This DVDs set taught me a lot even though I cook a lot of Asian food and I am an Asian myself. Most recipe is simple, very delicious and can apply to all kind of meats and vegetables. I brought two set of this DVDs, gave one to my mother and she loved it.I make the stir-fry sauce on Disc 3 and gave it out to some of my friends as a gift. They all loved it and ask for the recipe! Well worth the money. Really fun recipes to cook and eat."
1,Simply Bad: great idea for a show but hard to watch,"Ming has a good idea: Take one basic ""master recipe"" and apply it to three or more different dishes. Fantastic! Applying general concepts like this is the basis of learning to be a real cook. I'm sure that the concept would be a great boon to many home chefs.Unfortunately Ming himself is far too irritating to watch for long. His tendancy to be a smug, overbearing, know-it-all and impatient to boot render his show unwatchable by anyone but a Business School frat boy.If this guy has a book you should buy it and skip the heinous alpha-male kitchen posturing (with a ceramic chef knife)."
1,Be wary about doing business with Prima Cases,"I placed an order with Prima Cases that was supposedly in stock, but later I got an e-mail saying it was out of stock and should be shipping within 2 weeks. After a month the product still hadn't arrived so I got an e-mail saying the order was being cancelled because it was dormant for over 30 days. Two months later the product arrived, but by then I had already purchased a case elsewhere, and I have been trying to get a refund from them eversince. I have been dealing with this for 5 months and am just barely getting this resolved.***Bottom line: Be careful when you do business with Prima Cases and be sure to stay on top of things if you don't want to be taken advantage of!***"
1,Fiction at best,This book is fiction at best. There is not an element of truth in it. It's not worth the penny I paid for it. If you really care about the truth of the afterlife you will want to avoid this account.
2,A Good Read with Speed Bumps,"The spirit was willing, but...The idea: write a concise, frank, engaging history of the US Secret Service.The obvious barriers: well, it's secret. Research might be a wee problem. Getting ""the truth"" a huge issue...Less obvious: having a weak or incompetent editorial/fact checking staff. The editing here is just awful: typos, internal inconsistencies, needless repetition that slows down the narrative pace.Frustrating: this could be an endlessly fascinating story, but you hit speed bumps. I kept envisioning all the agents standing on the running boards of the presidential limo getting pitched off when..."
2,Dozens of errors -- skip this one,"I was tempted to toss this aside but eventually it became a game to find all of the errors. As mentioned before, there were many simple editing errors, and small sections of text are repeated throughout. I found a number of fact errors as well. Here's an example: a section describing weapons includes the Uzi, the M-16, and the ""Agent K-MPS"". That should have been the ""H & K MP 5"". Also, the ""author"" uses ""quotes"" many times on each ""page"" to make his ""points"" about ""facts"". Really annoying. But I did learn a thing or two about the service so I guess it wasn't a total loss."
1,inaccurate and dull,"The book is both inaccurate, and dull. Other than that, it's a total waste of time!"
3,"Very informative, however...","I found this book to be very informative as to the history and structure of the modern USSS. There are somethings that could have been done better.First, it could have been about 100 pages shorter. The authors tend to repeat information over and over as if the info were going to be on a test or something.Second, the relationships wth other agencies. The authors seem to cast the USSS in a better light while making it seem that other agencies are staffed with a bunch of under-trained clowns. Federal law enforcement is full of specialties. USSS agents on protection detail are never asked to investigate gun crimes, customs violations, illegal entry of immigrants or organized crime. Agents of other agencies however are frequently detailed to the USSS.For a good read on the USSS try Dennis McCarthy's ""Protecting the President"" or George Rush's ""Confessions of an Ex-Secret Service Agent"""
4,"Basically good, but reads like a term paper.","The book itself was quite interesting, and went into great depth into a number of subjects regarding the Secret Service. My major criticism is that there are countless typos in the book! I can't believe no one ran a spell check on the text. When there are that many mistakes, it demeans the whole work.But if you're interested in the Secret Service, like I am, you will definitely find the book interesting."
2,Interesting if poorly edited,"The book is an interesting source of information on the Service but I found that (1) there were several misspellings, typos, gramatical errors, and editorial mistakes that should have been caught at the publisher's, and (2) it seemed that several bits of information were repeated almost verbatim throughout the book -- ie., entire paragraphs that appeared to have been used more than once. Overall interesting but also disappointingly shy of information."
2,Do not confuse Gnochetti Sardi with Potato Gnocchi,"Gnocchi is a type of italian potato dumpling and are rather time consuming to make. I was hoping this machine would help with the shaping of the dough before boiling as it's called the MilleGnocchi attachment. Unfortunately, this machine is not to be used with gnocchi dough. The light fluffy potato dough will stick to all the mechanical workings. If you use a standard pasta dough instead, the attachment will make nicely shaped pasta."
1,Good looking but totally unusable,"This machine definetely deserves a star is for its ""heavy-duty"" look. However, I am unable to judge further simply because my specimen broke down after the first crank. An inspection of its mechanical construction showed that it had not been designed for actual use but rather for kitchen decoration..."
4,Love to read,"Another great mystery from this author. I enjoy and admire the development of his Posadas plots! Above all, any mystery with Bill Gastner is a reading treat."
1,I will never trust Black and Decker again,"I had a Black and Decker toaster oven for about 8 years, and when it finally broke, I tried to buy the same thing, and didn't look at reviews. Big mistake. Things have changed with Black and Decker. Their standard toaster oven is now horrible. It has no bell, and the top heating element broke quickly. The door is squeaky and slams shut.It's a complete waste of money. Avoid Black and Decker!"
1,Two units in a row broke just after warranty expiration,"I had two of Toaste-R-Ovens in arow and both broke after a little over a year, right after warranty expiration.In both cases, the top heaters stopped working. I threw away the first one and bought another unit since repair did not seem to be worth it, and here we go - exact same symptom, and at about the same time.I am not going to do this again!"
4,Black & Decker Toaster Oven,"I needed a new toaster oven and I wanted one that could be mounted under a cabinet to replace one that was old. This is one of the few that I found. As of now, I am very pleased with it."
1,Black & Decker TRO350 Toast-R-Oven,This toaster oven lasted less than a month before the toast button stopped working. The button will not stay down on its' own. The toast setting would work if you want to stand there and hold the button down until the toasting is finished. Do not buy a Black and Decker toaster oven as we have gone through about 6 in the last 3 years.
3,Pleased purchaser,"This Toast-R-Oven arrived right on time but had a flaw (toaster switch did not operate). Exchange was made immediately at no cost to me for which I was very pleased. The replacement works fine. It is smaller than the one replaced, but seems to toast quicker. My wife is very pleased with the under-the-counter mounting. Overall, for the price we consider it a satisfactory toast-r-oven."
2,A letdown:,"I bought a new one because the old one (5 years!) lost its toasting ability. It had to be the same one, because the hanging spot was there. My new toaster oven is a throwback to an earlier era: couldn't B&D add some bells and whistles? The price is higher then 5 years ago! The toasting situation is dire: even though my dial is turned to ""darkest"" the bread comes out hot and soft."
1,inferior product,"Sometimes burns toast, sometimes does not toast at all. Leaks heat. Started making an annoying buzzing sound. Now the ""toast"" button does not work - as soon as you press it, the toaster turns off again."
1,Junk,"This toaster oven is a waste of money. The ""on"" light burned out in one month. At five months the top heating element burned out. It is a cheap appliance and has a very cheap feel and very poor quality."
3,"Very good toaster, but","I've been very happy with this toaster oven that we bought a few years ago on amazon.com. It is compact, toasts bread and nuts very quickly and evenly and is much better for heating up a leftover pizza slice than the microwave. However, I am looking for a new one since the start button has failed - that button is not well designed and after some metal fatigue due to much use, no longer connects with a lever inside the oven control box to turn it on. Took it apart once to re-rig the switch, but it was clear it would only be temporary and indeed it is failing again. So, great oven, but maybe not if you are looking for a 10 year one!"
5,An overview of Homocysteine,"This book gives a very good,concise,overview of the expending field Homocysteine.It exhibits a large knowledge on the qestion,with clear presentations,discussions,from the definition of hyperhomocysteinemia to arguments to treat it.This book is precious for everybody interested in this field."
1,not ideal in any way,"We just installed oneof these in our kitchen door to find out that it cannot be securely shut - allowing easy entry from the outside of unwanted humans or animals (and cold air). The ""closer"" is very, very thin bendable plastic with only a few small plastic slips holding it in place on the inside. It also has a ""flimsy"" plastic latch. It took my medium sized dogs a few minutes to scratch their way in from the outside when the ""closer"" was in place. I was able to push it in with my hand with very little pressure. Living in a woodsy area with bears and raccoons I am very worried that I will have an unwanted visitor when I am NOT home. We are so disastisfied we are buying a whole new kitchen door and will shop carefully for a dog door that is actually safe to put in a door. It is also very energy inefficient and allows in a lot of cold air. Poor quality product!"
2,Doesn't actually attach to machine!,"The Imperia Noodle Machine is a great pasta machine. I just received it a couple weeks ago and have already made 4 batches of pasta that have been thoroughly enjoyed in my household. The angel hair attachment is quality and cuts perfectly fine noodles.My big complaint is that this angel hair attachment doesn't actually attach to the machine correctly! At least mine doesn't. It has convex hooks just like the machine does, when it should have concave ones to properly connect (like the spaghetti/linguine attachment that comes with it). So I end up having to find a way to secure it somewhere while running delicate dough through and turning the crank. It's needlessly frustrating and awkward. Maybe I just got a fluke one, but fair warning."
3,Only buy if you need more practice tests,"Do not buy this book if you are looking for a guide to prepare for the ACT...this is because the book only has about 15 pages of review per test. So, if you need a review book, I suggest that you go to the Princeton Review book, which does a pretty good job.However, if you have used up all the practice tests in the book that you are currently using, then I strongly reccommend this book. The book offers four practice tests (even though the cover says it offers two tests.) Each answer is fully explained, which makes the tests a lot better than the other books.So, if you need review, don't add this book to your cart. If you need more tests, this book is a very good source."
4,ACT prep,This prep book is excellent for students planning to take the ACT for college admission. It provides initial explanations for each section of the test. Then there are included 4 full practice tests with explanations for every correct answer for each test. I have used it with each student I tutor for the ACT and would recommend it. It also shows how to determine the student's overall score for each test.
2,Inaccurate,"I've found the science practice tests and other tests to be pretty inaccurate. I've taken the ACT three times, and the science test is nothing like the practice tests in this book. The passages and experiments are much too simple (the carbon cycle, for example) with questions that are much too hard--sometimes absolutely impossible. The explanations of answers oftentimes don't make sense. And, unlike the real test, the science practice tests required some actual science knowledge. ACT science really just tests your reasoning skills. This book is also misleading about time, since the passages took much less time to read than they normally would. I buy these books FOR the practice tests, so I was disappointed that the tests were so misleading. I would recommend getting books produced by Kaplan. They're much more accurate."
4,Cuts to the chase...,I purchased this for my daughter who is prepping for the ACT. This was one of two books she is using as a guide. She really likes this book because it narrows in and calmed her down about the stress of this test. I recommend this book to every 16 year old pre-prep student.
4,fun punk,"end of an era is full of catchy punk rock songs. not too hardcore, but not too poppy. it's not the kind of music that's going to become all mainstream and end up on mtv or anything. listening to this album always puts me in a good mood... i first heard the pinkerton thugs on ""go-kart vs. the corporate giant #2"", and then borrowed the cd from my friend. i'd say it's worth buying, especially if you like ""out come the wolves"" by rancid. (although this cd's not as good.)ps. the song ""no heroes, no justice"" is always stuck in my head, it's one of my favorite songs on the album."
4,The Pinkerton Thugs,"This album is a decent attempt at Oi! flavored street punk with heavy traditional rock 'n roll influences as well (and maybe even a little AC/DC!). The biggest downfall to the album, in my opinion, are the overtly communist/socialist/leftist lyrics. However, these can be easily overlooked, as they are smartly written. Overall, a good solid album."
3,Title Misleading,"Only a small fraction of this book deals with the actual ""burning of Chambersburg"". A more apt title might be ""McCausland's 1864 Raid[s]"", or better still ""McCausland and Johnson's Raids of 1864"". While maps are helpful and somewhat well detailed, they're not to scale, so the distance traveled by units to engage each other is often lost. While we know what roads are available today to get to these sites, and know that they are over most of the same roadbeds as then, an overall period map that might have been viewed by the parties envolved would have been very enlightening. Still, there's not that much material out there on this topic relative to other campaigns, and this book contains a lot of information/excitement of Confederate Cavalry raids in hostile territory in a very readable format."
2,Lacking in Personality Depth,"I found this work sadly lacking in the one aspect that would have made this a darn good read. Background and biographical information on the antagonists of either side is woefully short. We get next to nothing in the way of background info on McCausland and his subordinates, as well as Confederate Gen. Jubal Early or the Union army ersonnel involved. Neither is information on the units involved in this campaign provided. The work is presented, in my opinion, in a way that assumes the reader is knowledgable of the war and soldiers involved. While the movements of the various units before, during, and after the raid are covered quite well, it is written in the mode of a regimental history, dry and without adding much in the way of things that would be interesting to the casual student of the war and campaign. The book reads like an hour by hour trip from Cleveland, Oh. to Philadephia, Pa., and is about as interesting."
1,SanDisk SDMSV-2048-A10 2.0 GB Memory Stick Pro-Review,"After buying this product, I opened the case after few days, as I was out of country, to use this memory stick in my camera or other devices. However every time I put it in the camera or other devices, it gives error and doesn't work. I couldn't use this memory stick since I bought it and as I opened the box almost 15 days after the receipt,I am not sure how I can even return it back either. Basically not at all happy with the product at this time."
2,Dull...lifeless.,"I was disappointed after reading the other Dun books. This would have been excellent if compressed into a 15 minute short story. The story line and characters soon become stale and boring. I thought the Tilok proverb that states ""If you piss on yourself, you'll have wet feet"", summed this one up superbly."
2,Are our expectations that low?,"I can't understand how this book received all these good reviews. A promising storyline shouldn't be enough, should it? The book feels like a blind date with a woman who looks attractive but within first 15 minutes turns out to be a bi-polar mother of 2 ADD kids, whose daddy didn't love her, currently employed as a pet psychic. Too much baggage cluttering the story. The delivery is very anti-climactic, feels like Ben Stein from ""The Wonder Years"" is reading it in your head. I don't know, maybe I'm a bit spoiled by Crichton, Brown and early Clancy, but read and see for yourself."
1,Inaccurate yet reminiscent of yesteryear,"So much of what was told in the book was found inaccurate. We were so concerned about what was represented in the book, that our book club tried to reach the author during our discussion for comment...but was not successful.Entertaining if it were a fictitious work, found to be very narrowly focused."
4,"Great light, short lifespan","This light is great, but make sure you get at least two, three would be better. On the plus side: the battery is an amazing 15 watts -- that's 5x more light than the average consumer video light. The drawback: the light lasts about 15 minutes on a full charge; it takes 5 hours to fully charge though. Would have given it 5 stars, were it not for the short lifespan. Lamp life is 50 hours. Worth the investment!"
3,Sima LED vs. Sunpack,Recently I purchased a Sima 30 LED light for the same price that lasts 1 hour on a charge. I no longer carry this with me unless the Sima isn't charged. This light gives a nicer color but if you want something that lasts all day at a wedding chose the Sima light.
2,uneven illumination,"i purchased this unit because of good reviews. The bad reviews given on the basis of the long charge time and short illumination time, which is for me is not an issue as i use it for still photography and it sufficient time for my needs, and 5 hours charge is not that long, just plug it a forget it, it will be charged.The unit is solid 4 or 5 star unless the one factor that wasn't mentioned by reviewers that i wish it would be mentioned.The real problem that the unit doesn't gives an even illumination. Instead of an even spotlight it gives ring shape of light where light fades in the center and brighter at the ages. This one factor ruined the tool, and its good only as a household flashlight."
2,Buyer beware! Only 6 minutes of illumination for me - YMMV!,"I normally don't use consumer equipment, but I needed a camera light ASAP, so I ran out to purchase this product quickly at my local Fry's Electronics. I saw the reviews on Amazon beforehand and was prepared for the short illumination time (around 10-15 minutes). This one lasted only 6 minutes (after a 5 hour charge). I was using it to shoot a quick video blog at a convention. I was very disappointed. Your mileage may vary with this one. I'd pass on it and purchase something that you can actually use more practically. Always account for more time than you need!"
2,Battery life is horrible,"I get less than 3 minutes of use out of the video light. I might have a defective battery, but I've been very disappointed in the battery life and as a result, I very rarely break this out."
5,greatest star wars's book,"everything you want to see about ep.I,II and III. I have many star wars's reference books but this book is perfect."
4,sweatshirt,The sweatshirt was great but I paid extra for faster delivery and it did not arrive in time for my son's birthday. I feel that I would have gotten just as fast if I went with the cheaper shipping.
5,Very Helpful Book,"I have been tired for most of my life. In college they used to prefix my name with ""fall asleep as soon as she sits down girl"". After numerous blood tests, a doctor finally reccommended nutrition. Pam's book really helped me understand the causes of my fatigue. I can't say I am full of energy now, but I am much more energetic than ever before and I have lost five pounds to boot! Thanks, Pam."
5,Excellent Product,"This food strainer is not the fastest in the world, even with the optional motor...but it is well built and will last for years. It is hard to beat the price and the wonderful job this machine does. Consider you can put raw tomatoes in and it spits out the skins and seeds...how much is that worth to you? $40 is a cheap price to pay for this item and you will be happy with the results...just realize operating it by manually cranking it is not easy, it is work. If you want something easy, go to the store and buy your tomato or apple sauce. If you want the satisfaction and quality of homemade, use this strainer."
3,some disapointments,"The item does work nicely seperately the good stuff from the bad, but there's a lot of pieces to keep up with, clean, and try to remember how to put back together. Some of the pieces are small. Also, I don't like that most things have to be cooked well before they will strain. I figured hard stuff like sweet potatoes and carrots would have to be softened, but I wish it would at least do apples and pares raw. I haven't tried it yet with tomatoes. I'm really hoping it will work with muscadines when I get another crop."
3,Concept OK,"Sound and Video quality not up to the task.McNiece is almost unintelligible....Costumes were BIG on the cod pieces, but little else."
3,Only For Public School Kids,"These devotionals are all written for the typical, public school child in mind. They introduce and address topics that the home schooled child would (thankfully) not even be aware of."
2,Beginning with God,This book helps young people to work through problems. It tells them the best way to handle things. The children we work with really like the book.
3,somewhat disappointing,"The book of sheet music and the accompaniment CD come together, but the sheet music and the accompaniment don't really match. I really wanted to learn the introduction parts of some of these arias, and the sheet music has that, but the music on the CD starts later, at the ""main"" part of the aria. This means that, as you start an aria on the CD, you have to jump ahead in the sheet music to figure out where the CD track is starting. I feel like I got about 2/3 of what I thought I was buying. Still, I don't know of anything better out there."
5,Wife loves it,Gave it to her for Christmas and she loved it - she made me gain 250 pounds in two months from eating pancakes ;)
4,eating well now,This griddle was bought as a gift. My friend says she can now cook for several people and be able to eat w/them. Her only complaint is that it is to big to fit in the dishwasher and her cupboards. If you don't need one this big I would suggest buying one a little smaller.
5,Unbelievable!,My sister bought this for my son as a gift. I can NOT believe how fantastic this guy is!! He says he wants people to listen and not know they're hearing a tuba. He's right. He's phenomenal!
4,Beautiful and clear,"I think the basic technique is explained clearly; because of that, the book could be a good start for people who want to explore the technique. Pictures are useful to see the final product."
4,A beautifully illustrated book!,"I found this book to have wonderful pictures and directions with the pictures so you can see how to do it. There are also many ideas for use of parchment craft other than cards. I really liked that. However, the only problem I encountered was that the patterns need to be enlarged. Therefore, I had to cut out the pages of the patterns (which I did not like to do) and then take them to a copy store to be enlarged. As I am a stay-at-home mom with a very busy 8 month old, the only time I can enjoy crafting is at night, and as eager as I was to get started on some of the projects, I had to wait for what seemed like forever before I had a chance to make it to the store. And then there was the added cost of the enlargements. These were the only drawbacks of this book to me."
5,Original projects,This book is a fabulous resource to make a beautiful and incredible projects for multiple occasions. Each project is very easy and elaborated for his good presentation.
4,A delightful introduction to an obscure paper craft.,"This is a little known/practiced craft in the US. Well known in the UK and in Latin American countries, this book is a welcome addition to the paper crafters library."
5,Rugged Can Opener that Works!,"I had 3 other brands of electric can openers that all were junk before I got one of these. After 5+ years of service it is still going strong and I want to purchase another for my daughter. Powerful enough to open #10 cans, nice touch of having a timer that the wife always uses, quiet, and cover rotates upward to conceal opener when not in use. Easy dis-assembly for cleaning. Performs as advertised."
2,Did Not Fit My car,"I bought this fuel pump for a 1997 Buick Riviera. I check out the spec's and what cars it was made for.It listed my Riv. OEM replacement. WAS NOT....nothing was made to fit in my 1997 Riv. Even the ring that fits over the pump after you install the pump to seal it into your gas tank didn't fit pump.Sent it back to Amazon, Amazon was GREAT!!! No problems with my return what so ever!!!! Even paid for shipping back!So....if you have a Buick Riviera....don't buy this pump."
4,Cabnit heat guard,Bought this 4 years ago to get the toaster oven off the counter. Still working great and adds space to counter use
3,A must have to keep counter clear,"This is a must have to keep your toaster oven off the counters. I just ordered a new Black & Decker toaster oven, and it is white. This mount is black, so I bought High Temperature spray paint and painted it white. It now matches all my kitchen appliances and the new toaster oven. One draw back of this item is that if you have a heavy coat of laquer on your cabinets, the heat that is given off from this hood can soften the coat of laquer,"
1,Do not buy this,"Black & Decker no longer makes, and no one has in stock a compatible toaster oven for this mount. People sell the compatible ovens used on eBay for upwards of $100.00 plus shipping."
2,Don't bother waking up for this one,"If you are completely new to the work world, and very naive in general, this book may tell you something new about the way things work in business. The subject matter was mostly fluff, and was far from funny. Try reading Winning Office Politics by Dubrin instead."
2,"Buy ""The Dilbert Principle"" instead",Most everything in the book somehow ends up back to people wanting to travel to get frequent flyer miles. I travel a lot for my job...the frequent flyer miles are not worth it. Where did the author get that idea anyway. Dilbert (Scott Adams)is a much better authority on office high-jinx.
4,Meets my needs,"Purchased this calculator for my job to replace one that had broken. Same brand and almost the same style as my previous one; however, it doesn't seem to have the same sturdy feeling. Wish I could find somewhere to have my old one fixed."
2,"Did not work, it wouldn't even power up!",I hooked the unit up and connected it a TV but could not receive any stations. I noticed that the power LED on it was not lit. I swapped the unit out with another amp with a lower gain rating and was able to receive stations.
1,Villaware Ravioli Attachment,"This is a somewhat useless product. It is messy to use and requires a bit of coordination. The ravioli are formed in sheet and need to be invidually separated by cutting. Since the manufacture does not recommend washing, the cleaning up is a choir."
2,"When It's Good, It's Good, But ...","I've used this about 6-8 times, and of those, had one trouble-free batch. The other times the dough got snagged by a regulating piece in the middle, or the filling was inconsistent or spilled over (too much, too little). Being left-handed also difficult to work with comfortably."
4,Works well if you use it correctly,"This attachment is not for a quick or easy fix, but neither is making your own pasta. If you work steadily and carefully, following the directions and having a fair amount of patients, you will get good ravioli.Do NOT overfill the hopper with filling and be sure to dust well the outside of the pasta dough before running it through the machine. If you don't, it will get stuck and make quite a mess. Watch how the filling goes in, load it in the center, and turn the crank slowly. If the filling starts to squeeze to the edges, use a spoon or other tool to pull it back to center so it does not push out the sides. Also watch how much filling you have as you run near the end of the sheet of dough. If it looks like the dough will run out before the filling does, remove the excess filling!I have used this a lot and it is time consuming, but worthwhile. I freeze large batches for later use. These are small ravioli, so if you like larger ones, make them completely by hand."
4,Mario Batali prep bowl set,My fault that I didn't look at the exact measurements. The bowls where smaller than I expected.
5,Very useful...........daily,"I find that I use these almost daily. They basically have become my new prep bowls.........for small amounts. Nice quality, easy stacking, even great color. Will probably buy a second set."
2,five crappy pieces,"I bought two sets of these as a wedding gift because they looked lovely and also they were dishwasher safe and microwaveable. (so I will give them that) However, they were shipped unwrapped (in plastic), unprotected, and rather dingy in a box. They are what they are. If they are what they are what you are looking for, then they will suit your purposes. They were not something I would give as a gift and not even something I would bother keeping for myself. SO I returned them and then was a satisfied customer."
5,Great All-Purpose Measuring Cups,"These are great all-purpose measuring cups. Often in cooking (especially baking), you have a recipe that calls for three ingredients to be added at a given step in the process. For example, a cup of milk with a teaspoon of vanilla and a tablespoon of honey. This is an example where these measuring cups excel. You use the 2 cup bowl which has a line inside for the 1 cup mark. Fill the milk to the one cup line, then add the vanilla and honey. You only use one item (less cleaning). Also good when activating yeast for breadmaking."
2,looks good but not durable,"These measuring cups are so cute & handy I had to have them -- plus who doesn't trust Mario Batali?? -- but they are quite a disappointment. From the very first they faded and then stained! and now 2 of the bowls have cracked and we had throw them away. And melamine is NOT microwave safe so I don't know why people keep saying they use them in the microwave. I love the shape & the double measuring lines, I just wish they could be produced in a new material -- Pyrex anyone???"
5,Nice measuring prep bowls,"I picked up this set in 'pesto' at Ross somewhere along the way. The pleasant green color caught my eye. I use prep bowls a LOT in my cooking and this is a nice set to have for that. I do wish it had a 1/3-2/3 cup, though. I'm not super exacting in my measuring for cooking (but try for absolute precision in baking), so I am really fine with the half-measure in the inner bowls. For example, if a recipe calls for 1C of onions, and I have a nice size one that yields me a bit more, I don't care. I use the whole onion rather than store or waste 2 or 3T.These measuring cups are made out of melamine and are not microwave safe. I do put them in the top rack of my dishwasher, though, and have found them to be fine with that."
2,A weak hodgepodge,"Two EPs from 1986 (""The Sea Org"" and ""Brain Song"") with four bonus tracks. Most of this feels labored and shrill - the Trio in cerebral assault mode. The EPs weren't all that focused to begin with, and the extra material doesn't frame or clarify, it's just kinda there. Actually it's pretty dull. ""Walk Gently Through the Gates of Joy"" is a MUCH better collection of early Hafler Trio."
1,"Boring, Biased, and Beatific","After reading this I could not help but think that this was absolutely pointless. The opinions and conclusions of the author are based on the jounals and such of one person. Each point is made with one person's journal entry, or opinion. The only reliable and reasonable source that she had was the New York papers, which were sent in by thousands of people. Besides, the book doesn't make any conclusion that any thinking person wouldn't have come up with in the first place. The book basically says that people were motivated by money to do this. Well Duh!"
4,Bracken Does the World,"Bracken presents sensual but paranoid visions of society, the arts, politics and sex in these shocking, possibly true, essays.Here, he comes off as sort of a philosophical James Bond investigator; perusing those filthy Eastern European night spots, entertaining and provoking conspiracy theory, all the while rubbing up rather forwardly against the depths of women's innermost desires in order to fulfill his own occult, or at least rather rare, cravings for love, lust, political savvy, social meaning and French literary largesse.Many planes were cancelled for days after 9-11-01.Why...why...why did they let this man back in the country?"
1,disk in half!!!,there is a disk in the middle of the stepper just broke in half.Do not waste your money!!!!!
1,How could they even ship this?????,"I ordered this NEW for my Mother. The box is all beat up, warn and old. It's taped back together and is embarrassing! I can't believe I have to present this to my Mom like this. It's all I got for her, and tomorrow is Xmas. I feel humiliated. I can feel additional humiliation coming on once she opens it. Probably a mess inside too! You've ruined my Xmas."
1,Terrible quality. Broke on first day,The product is terrible. I opened the box and the packing was shabby. I assembled it as instructed and tried it. The wheel snapped immediately. Returning it.Not recommended.
5,Great investment for the price...,"I have used some type of mini stepper at least 3 or 4 times a week for over 15 years. This is simply the most quiet, yet effective stepper I have found in this price range. It is great for a condo or apartment and stores easily under a bed or behind a door. All steppers in this price range seem to last about 2-4 years, depending on manufacturing. This stepper is one of the more durable I've found to date. My weight fluctuates between 115 and 120 lbs. and 20 minutes a day on the stepper keeps my ""assets"" from dropping, rain or shine ;-)"
2,Plastic wheel broke after 1st week,"I love the exercise, but the plastic wheel didn't hold up to the pressure. I am going to try a different brand."
2,It won't last long...,I love the idea of having a mini-stepper at home. This one would be ideal for me only if it didn't break so easily. I purchased my second Hers Mini-Stepper less than a month ago and the cable that goes around the pulley broke YET AGAIN!!! That's exactly what happened with the first one. I'm gonna keep looking for a more durable version of this. As for this particular stepper - it's a total waste of money. Poorly made.
5,Every summer vacation should be this memorable.,"As a third grader in Minnesota in 1958, this book made Florida seem like the most exciting and exotic place in the world. The ensuing mystery that evolves with the inheritance of an old motel, the discovery of the odd guests that come to stay there and a mysterious alligator make it memorable. The two curious kids who lead very ordinary lives back home, keep looking for adventure at every turn in the story to make this vacation one to remember. A delightful tale that every summer vacation should live up to! The book was a childhood classic to me and when I moved to Miami, FL in 1986, every side trip to Sanibel, Captiva, Key West, etc. required extra time searching for the original site of The Pink Motel. I wanted to see (or imagine) the setting of the book that gave me such enjoyment."
3,An excellent reference damaged by ...,"I agree with previous reviewers on what this excellent book is and isn't (Not really for beginners, there is an implied expertise level of the reader, lots of research in writing the book, etc.) However, after using the book for 5 months now, I have a constructive complaint for the editors, who apparently lack the practical knowledge of using a cookbook. What rationale drove them to use such small and hard to read fonts? What drove them to actually use a pale blue ink for some text? (E.g., try reading the ingredient list on page 272 - miniscule font, in that pale blue ink.) Unless your kitchen is very brightly lit, and you have the eyes of an eagle, you will have great difficulty in reading the text. The entire book has a great deal of unused 'white space' that could have been better used by using a larger, darker contrasting font. If there is a second edition, I hope it is more legible (ditch the pale blue ink.)"
5,This book makes it seem so easy,"Take it from someone who isn't that comfortable in the kitchen, James Peterson makes this ""cooking thing"" easy. Even I can follow the recipes. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in cooking or recipes."
1,Zionism - The Real Enemy of the Jews,The author is just another anti-Jewish individual who writes a book that the Jews are the cause of their own problems by being Zionists. I don't know how many times this same nonsense has been stated before by other Jew haters. The truth of the matter is that Zionism is nothing more than the Jews wanting their country back that was taken away by the Roman Empire in 70 AD. It really is just that simple. I would not suggest that any morally minded person buy this trash.
1,This book is nonsense,"The author made several factual errors and has made the mistake that often betrays the ideology of an anti-semite. He blames anti-semitism on the Jews. Of course he doesn't call this problem ""Jews,"" only ""Zionism,"" which is obviously Mr. Hart's codeword of choice for Jews. Communists that hated Jews often labelled them as ""Capitalists."" Captialists that hated Jews often occused them of being ""Communists."" Whatever an anti-semite hates is what the Jew represents to him/her.The vast majority of Jews today feel Zionism as a great thing. Every people is entitled to a land where they can be safe and self-governing. Mr. Hart would like to see this right denied."
3,Ok but extremely overpriced for what it is,"I enjoyed the video but found most of the knowledge discussed to be information readily available in most military manuals. As a former Marine and Army firearms trainer and technician I found it a good review but not really relaying any ""new knowledge."" With that said I do recommend it. But it is overpriced for what it is.I purchased my copy from Paladin Press and was disappointed as it and all their other videos on this subject were recorded at super long play and the grainyness made it difficult to really see all that was presented. There really is no excuse to charge Standard Play rates for Super Long Play videos."
5,The Imposters is a small indy gem,"I've watched the movie several times and the soundtrack became more prominent for me as I watched the movie, so I had to buy it. It's terrific, fun tango from the 20's & 30's."
1,Disappointed,Mold arrived damaged. I used it anyway as time was short. Gave up after several tries; will not unmold without breaking at small(tail)end of mold.
5,Lovely,"I was excited to see what the Ooh La La dolls would look like since I liked the Tokyo A Go-Go collection and I LOVED the Pretty 'N Punk collection. I don't think the clothes in Ooh La La are as unique or as creative as the clothes in the Tokyo and Punk collections, but I still like them a lot. They're pretty and feminine. The only downside to me for the Ooh La La girls is the price--$19.99 for each doll. I think the higher prices were justified for the Tokyo and Punk dolls, but I think the Ooh La La girls shouldn't cost more than $14.99 at the most. Anyway, I think Dana is the prettiest in this collection, I love her clothes. The girls have painted-on gloves and stockings, which don't bother me since I don't intend to redress them. A great collection and I wonder what country the girls will visit next!"
1,Dell Inspiron 5100 battery,"Ordered this battery for my laptop. Arrived and it was dead. Contacted company to return it. Communication on how to return the product was timely, but when I got a replacement battery that was dead too. I was able to return it and even though I got all my money back in full it was a lot of headache going back and forth with the emails and having to twice make a trip to the post office to ship it back. It took a over a month to finally close this issue. Even though I got all my money back in full and the emails on the status was very communicative it was a pain. It took two dead batteries to be delivered to a customer before an email from customer service stated that maybe the batch was bad and it needed to be looked into."
1,Battery life poor,This battery seemed fine for the first few months. I use this laptop only about 3-4 times a year while traveling. The computer is always plugged in when not in use so it is charging. After less than a year the battery would only hold a charge for about 1/2 of the original charge life. After 1 1/2 years the battery would not even boot up the computer and would not charge at all. My original battery which is 8 years old will still at least run the computer for about 15 minutes. [...]
4,Very pretty,"I bought these for my grandmother who cannot have pierced ears. She loved them. The color is very bright and beautiful. The earring are not too large, and are a great update to any outfit."
1,I can't listen to it on my iPod - what's up with that?,I'd like to listen to Marisa Monte but I can't load it on my iPod - Does anyone still use CD players to listen to CDs? Does anyone know how to override the CDS 200 virus so that I can load it on an iPod?
5,Sometimes less is more,"Marisa keeps fascinating her listeners with her unimitable and authentic timing, cadences choice of repertoire, and her highle capable voice that has finesse and souplesse, the purity of which goes right under the skin. This album shows MM more and ever in a contemplating fashion, addressing basic human experiencies regarding life and love. Abundancy and extroversy would be highly out of context. Instead, the lyrics and intrepretation show MM vulnerable and authentic. To listeners that understand Portuguese, that is."
3,Its OK....,I would suggest spending a bit more to get a higher quality one. This one is pretty cheap. The basket dents and bends very easily.
2,No good for deep frying,Purchased the Presto Kitchen Kettle primarily to replace a very old Fry Daddy. Unfortunately it would not heat oil (or anything) to above 320f.I exchanged it for another. Same exact problem. It might be good for other things but two out of two were no good for deep frying.
5,EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED,"This is exactly what I wanted and needed . But I did find it for a lot less at that ""big box store"" . But that takes away nothing from the product itself. Work flawlessly cooking fries , and chicken . And the lid makes it even better."
5,Presto Steamer,This is a great steamer and large enough to steam alot of veggies. www.sunrisescents.com
2,Great except for non-stick finish not sticking to the pot!,"I discovered the Kitchen Kettle while searching for something to make my daily pot of soup... and keep it warm. The Kitchen Kettle is fantastic for this BUT, after only a couple months use the non-stick surface is coming off at a tremendous rate! Is this usual or do I have one that is defective. Except for this fault I would rate at the highest level. Is there anything out there that is remotely the equivalent of the KK? I suppose, at about $20/pot that I could replace one every 2-3 months but that seems rather silly."
3,Great for occasional use,"I purchased this cooker and was greatly pleased with the temperature controls, giving it a versatility other cookers don't have. However, after continued use (daily), the non-stick surface pits and peels (and this is not at high temperatures at all). For the casual user, this is a great product. Easy to clean and use and a good buy for the money. But for someone who plans to use it every day, I would suggest something with a cooking surface that will not come off with repeated use. Try something in stainless."
5,Awesome multi-cooker,We bought this cooker because my husband wanted a deep fryer and I wanted a slow cooker. We were living in a small apartment and didn't have room to buy multiple appliances. We just figured we'd buy seperate ones when we moved to a bigger place. But this cooker is so wonderful that we decided to keep it. We use it at least once a week and it is still like new and is so easy to clean.
2,magnetic cord,"what a stupid idea, you are coasting along waiting for the temp to the right degree and then nooooooo, your magnetic break away cord is off its mark and no you have no idication that you are not heating---if for some person needs a break away cord to avoid spilling--I suggest that you eat out at McDonalds"
3,Everything perfect except hot surface,"I grabbed one at Wal-Mart after reading many compliments. I returned it after deep-frying twice. This one is well designed that the electric control unit is removable so the pot is easy for cleaning. However, this cooker is deep and when I need to stir the stuffs inside with temperature set at 400F, it's unavoidable to touch the damn hot surface accidentally. I figured, sooner or later I would be burned by this baby and decided to return it.Bottom line is: for deep fryer cool touch would better be a must-have feature."
2,Not a deep fryer,Just picked one of these up at Walmart thinking the temperature control was an improvement over the old PrestoGranpappy that finally gave up the ghost after 10 years. Wrong. This may work great for soups and other cooking but it's a bust for deep frying. Turned up to max the oil never got above 325 degrees. Cooked fish and fries and they were an oily mess. If you want a decent deep fryer keep looking.
2,"Good performance,,,until it dies","I purchased this fryer a couple of years ago and had great luck with it for a year (probably used it 4 times that year). Then the heating ""element"" died. The probe would not activate the heat, which I have no idea how or where to replace. So I am in the market for a new one."
5,Presto kitchen kettle multi cooker,I had one of these before and it simply wore out. When my granddaughters come to visit they are always fixing french fries and this is ideal for that purpose. It also is an excellent steamer.
5,Very Nice Flag Pin,The finish on this pin is great. The picture does not do it justice but all of the lines and stars are very clear.
4,"A decent pin, but not the best.","This is a decent pin, but I've seen better. The pin is beautiful, but the stars are not level with the edges of the blue area of the flag. Still, this is a lovely pin, very shiny and the red stripes are lined with gold trim and that makes me like it.I'd recommend it for the price, but if you have cash to spend, you can find a better one."
4,Excellent translation of The Diamond Sutra,I gave this book a 4 star rating because it is easy to read and the text is up to date and very readable. Red Pine has many quotes from Zen masters to help pack out the meaning and get at the deep meaning that is in this sutra. Take your time and find out why this sutra has much to teach the ordinary zen student of today. Red Pine unpacks the deep meaning within this stutra.
5,A tonic,"This album is a gentle Sunday drive through space while eating a delicious sherry trifle! Well, each to his own. However you want to think about it, you will love this record. It's fun, easy listening, bouncy music which will lift your spirits whatever mood you're in. That's not to say it lacks depth, it's just that the varied emotions present are all positive. Luke Vibert has given us this beautiful album with all his love."
3,Not quite Throbbing Pouch ...,"Luke Vibert's latest doesn't quite live up to the immaculate ""Throbbing Pouch"" or the drum 'n' bass of his Plug recordings, but does offer a few worthwhile listens, i.e. ""Piano Playa Hater."" I found some tracks, like the single ""Lovely"" a little annoying, however."
4,Wunderkind,"Luke Vibert has dazzled us again with his twisted musical visions on Tally Ho! Filled with insatiable melodies and easy listening ""favorites"", this deep ride will either leave you smiling, or making you want to turn it off for something more sinister. An amusing album filled with lots to consume, Tally Ho! is worth a listen, and earns a rightful place as unique, and frightfully fresh. Mr. Vibert has found a vibe that few dare to tread upon."
3,"This is NOT a review, its IS merely a suggestion","If you are at all interested in Wagon Christ (Luke Vibert), do yourself a huge favor and check out his Musipal album.Tally Ho could be compared to a warm up to Musipal. Vibert had not fully developed his style on Tally Ho, and it simply does not hold a candle to his sophomore album as Wagon Christ - Musipal.Musipal is nicely composed with obscure and interesting samples, at times childish, yet mixed with masterful precision. He takes influences from Aphex Twin and Squarepusher on Musipal and blends them with his own style. There are some great downtempo songs as well as a blistering drum n' bass track or two.It looks like I just should have written a review for Musipal instead of Tally Ho, but that was the point anyway-peace"
4,Very inventive and funny.,"Luke Vibert uses samples to great effect on Tally Ho! especially in songs like Tally Ho! and Fly Swat. The beats are infectious, but sometimes the songs go a little long for my tastes. The songs are always very interesting and creative, using clever sound effects sometimes quite subtly sometimes right in your face to add depth to otherwise plain songs. A good CD if you like ""acid jazz"", might want to check this out if you are interested in trip-hop type stuff with a silly element too."
2,Just plain annoying; not music,"If the child-like cover art on the album, which is not in the least bit creative, did not disuade you from buying this album, then it should have.Even the tracks that almost sound like music, for example tracks 1 and 2, are quite monotonous. The beat is catchy, but quickly grows tiresome.Track 6 consists of the artist just talking; he utters bleeped-out sexual references. That's it. That's supposed to be music. Yeah, right.If this is a humorous album, it fails in that regard as well. I can see this coming from a bored teenager during a summer spent in his garage. Funny? Hardly.I only give it 2 stars because everyone else raved about the album, so perhaps I am missing something. Maybe there's a market for pseudo-humorous non-music."
2,I would NOT recommend this product,"I had a hard time with this product. The item does not cut the dough well and the ravioli kept opening as a result of this. In my opinion, I like the size of a 12 count ravioli maker better. This 10 count makes ravioli thats too large."
1,Toast button doesn't work after only one year!,We bought this toaster about a year ago and suddenly the toast button stopped working. You have to hold the button down with your finger to get it to toast.
2,battery killer,"Put in 4 brand new batteries, took as a back up, plug into ipod with 1/2 charge and the new batteries were dead and would not charge the ipod, the first batteries were in it for about 8 hrs., had to buy 4 more batteries and it worked.Do not put batteries in until ready to use!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Not Exactly What I Expected,"I looked at the Griffin battery pack in Best Buy. $29.00. I immediately looked it up on Amazon. It was 50 cents. I purchased thru Amazon. After receiving it I found it to have no batteries. Complained and was mailed batteries. Batteries are not rechargable. I made the mistake of comparing what was sold in the store to what was sold by Shopcell on Amazon. In defense of Amazon, they responded quickly to my no battery situation. Also be aware that even if you did use rechargable batteries, you could not charge them in the plastic battery pack. And the Best Buy (rechargable) pack will work with iPhones and this one is not recommended. Also, when Shopcell was asked to send batteries and user guide, only the batteries were received.In summation, no rechargable batteries. Problems with shipping. Not really compatible with iPhone. Not to be compared with store brand quailty."
2,not for everybody,"Be aware when buying this product that it doesn't have any overcharge protection on it, so it doesn't work with new ipod touch 3g+ or any model of iphone. The first week I had it the clip that keeps the case over the batteries snapped off; it's pretty touchy."
1,No results with item,Plugged the unit into my IPod Touch prior to trans pacific trip. IPod battery was drained and Tune Juice never functioned. Changed batteries with the same results. Glad I didn't pay any more for it as it is useless.
1,Sucks,Product is useless. Worked one time on fresh batteries and charged my Iphone 3gs from 50% to full charge. After that the batteries are dead. It won't do anything now.
1,Does not work for iPod Touch!,May work on older models - wasn't clear from web site that it did not work for Touch. Very disappointed.
2,Not worth it,"I bought this right before a long flight. It only slows down the drain on your ipod rather than substituting for the ipod battery. You also should check to make sure that the batteries have good contact as they shift in the case and then they do not work. You must hold the ipod for the entire time since it connects on the bottom and does not allow you to use a ""stand"". It really was not worth it."
1,Crap!!,"My iPhone 4 will not sync to this product at all! My phone gives a error message saying ""This Product Is Not Supported"" as soon as I plug it up."
3,Not for advanced beaders,The book does have quick projects. But they are boring for people who are accustomed to making complicated beaded jewelry.
2,Waste of Time,"Th authors waffle along about a collaborative style of management, never getting to the point. The 200 odd pages, would be a good read of about 30 pages if all the repetitive statements were removed. The only valuable idea in the book is the authors' ten step process to managing a problem collaboratively, although this is spoiled by their irretating, reptitive style of writing"
4,Great Little Vacuum for the Price!,"There really isn't a whole lot to say. It's inexpensive and it works. I recommend this for quick clean-up of the spa before a party or for just routine clean-up. If your spa is REAL dirty, like after a storm, this little vac will take forever to clean it. However, it WILL do the job."
1,Not For Ponds,"I purchased this product to do light cleaning of a goldfish pond (8x10) before winter set in. As others have mentioned (and is advertised) there is no pole to attach the vacuum, but I have several telescoping poles, so didn't order another. Problem is, the adapter is much larger than standard poles, so you will have to purchase a special size to fit. Secondly, the suction is very light, and didn't pick up much of the heavier debris (small pebbles, etc). It did pick up some ""muck"" but nothing substantial and the small bag to sift water/debris is so small it isn't practical to use (unless you don't mind emptying every few minutes). The suction power wasn't too impressive, but that could be because we have a well pump, and it may not generate enough water pressure. Of course, you won't know that until you try it.I would not suggest this product if you are looking for a small vacuum to do a light pond cleanup."
1,pool vacuum,"This was something out of a Cracker Jack Box. I was extremely disappointed. I purchased this to clean a child's small plastic pool. I would NOT recommend this product, it was a waste of money."
5,Peugeot Hand Coffee mill,I really like this coffee mill but think it was too expensive. I couldn't find anything less expensive that gave me hope of being well made. The grinder part has a lifetime warranty. I wish I knew where it was made. I bought it assuming that it is made in France but there isn't anything indicating the country of manufacture.
1,Instant Junk,"We bought this from our Local Office Depot, in 2007. Should have taken it directly to the dumpster. We didn't do any research before buying this printer and man are we regretting it now.This thing chews through ink like crazy. It seems like we can get about 20 sheets before one of the 4 (C,M,Y & Black) cartridges complains that it's running low on ink. Sure, the type 69 cartridges each cost less individually, but they add up quick every month or so! Also, the Epson type 69 cartridges are non-refillable, so that's another thing to consider."
1,White Elephant,This is just a money gobbler. The cartridges are way too expensive and cost per page just does not make sense. In short. Just look for another printer. Doing some more research will not really hurt and will save you money.
3,Great when it was working...paper feed sucks,"We've had this printer for 3+ years and it was great as a scanner and copier. Definitely a good buy for that, but as for printing, even though it has different chambers for ink, it won't let you print when one of the chambers is empty. Bummer right? Ink was pricey too. The huge deal about it though is the paper feed. I've had two Epsons CX6000 and CX2900 and they both had the same problem: the paper feed will skew which would lead to a paper jam. I feel bad to throw this printer now because I really loved the scanner feature. It was easy to set up and it made good quality scans.I'm looking at a Lexmark for cheap ink ($5 for black ink) and also a paper feeder that is flat not vertical."
5,Great Printer for Price and Features,"For those that have given this printer a poor review I have to disagree, I have had this printer for almost a year and loved it so much that I talked my sister into getting one. I have only replaced the cartridges once in the time I've had it and I use it for printing not only documents but also for printing photos onto the photo paper for my own prints. So the ink life if you actually read your book is great! The scanning feature is also AWESOME. I have taken pictures, like the ones you get in a photobooth at the mall and once scanned they are pretty much screen sized after scanning...All in All I would highly recommend this printer!!"
2,Epson CX6600,I'm already looking for a new printer after having the CX6600 for about a year and a half. It started printing poor quality about a year after the inital purchase and now is just about completely dead. One day of a new black ink cartridge and it said it had 4% ink left and refuses to print. The ink is too expensive as well. I will not be buying epson again. This is ridiculous!
1,BOYCOTT EPSON!!!!!,"The ink cartridges are ""chipped"" and are programmed to stop working after a certain number of copies, regardless of ink level. You will also notice the ink levels dropping FAST! These ""chips"" also prevent you from using any generic cartridges. Epson had been sued for this and paid a fine, however, the provisions of the suit did not require them to change this practice!!!!"
4,Impressed,I have only had this for about a month but so far it's been wonderful. It's very easy to use and has amazing quality. I noticed another reviewer mention how the printer cartridges run out quickly and I have already noticed that but otherwise it is great.
3,Very Good Printer,"I just used this printer over the weekend to scan and print some photos. Very easy to use. I liked that after a picture is cropped, the print feature still allows you to expand it to a full page. I was surprised at how the printer jumped when feeding the paper; but, for a $100 you can't go wrong. I'm going to buy one to replace my Epson 600 that finally quit working after 10 years."
1,AVOID EPSON AT ALL COSTS,"Epson purposely makes you buy 3 color ink cartridges and a black and white one to print even in just black and white. I've spent hundreds of dollars on ink and I have almost nothing to show for it. As soon as I install one cartridge, it says the others are empty. THIS IS A SCAM. I truly believe Epson is deceiving it's customers and I would eagerly join a class action suit against them."
1,Crap Printer Don't buy Epson,"Worked fine at first. Then after about 5 pages is said I needed more ink. Cost about a dollar a page. Then when I replaced ink it wouldn't print that color. Tried pulling ink and replacing, said I was out again.Piece of junk and ink runs out quick. Save your money."
1,This should get NO stars!!!,I have fussed with this printer for 2.5 years and I am done with it; well actually it quit on me and I am done with it. Do your research do your research do your research and DON'T buy this printer!Drivers go out all the timeCopier cuts off half the imageFeeder quit workingDoesn't use all the inkDoesn't recognize ink cartridgesUses too much ink
1,Ink Cost too high for me!,"I've had a lot of printers and have never spent so much money on ink. After a little less than 1 year with moderate use and maintaining regular maintenance with the Setup/Utilities feature the quality of the printing had deceased as well.This printer can be found at low bargain prices, but seems to only remain a bargain for those who seldom print and would not need to purchase frequent ink cartridges.I like some of the features: scanner was easy and provided good photo scans and easy to use.Overall I would probably not even purchase an Epson again. I've owned Canon, HP, Brother and never disliked one so much I wanted to replace it before it gave out; but this experience with my Epson has been unpleasant and do not desire to try another one since there are so many alternatives."
2,"Good prints, but...","This is, in and of itself, a good printer/scanner/copier. It makes good prints (when you use the right media), and scans accurately. I'm not too worried about print speed, because I'm an amateur home user. Where I take issue with the CX6600 is in changing ink. The cartridges have a chip on them which tells the printer when they think they're out of ink (whether or not they actually are); and once that happens, all you have is a (rather ugly) desk ornament. If, for example, you're out of cyan ink, you can't print in black only; you can't even scan. I discovered this recently when I needed to scan something for my job; that cost me some time running out to get some (obscenely overpriced) ink. I'm lucky with my CX6600 in that mine hasn't suffered the 'death by clogging' to which so many other owners seem to have fallen victim. To sum up: I would discourage anyone from buying this - or any other - Epson printer."
1,Don't waste your money . .,"Very noisy. I've used quite a few ink jet printers over the years - this is , by far, the noisiest of the bunch.In just over a week, the black ink was gone and I printed no more than 50 - 75 pages. I bought the CX6000 to replace a Epson CX5400 that died after 2 1/2 years of fairly heavy use. Doing the same type of printing, the ink in the 5400 would last from 6 - 8 weeks or longer, NOT just a week.1/4 tank of each of the colored inks was used just to do a nozzle check. Later I printed some maps - the only color on them was a few outlines made with high lighter. Then I printed two approx 4 x 6 colored pictures. I was warned that there wasn't enough colored ink left to print another page like the one I had just printed. Pretty expensive pictures!I returned the CX6000 and bought a Canon Pixma MP600 which got wonderful reviews here on Amazon and computer magazines. So far, I'm loving the Canon printer."
2,Pass This One By!,"This offers the best of everything, but the printer is horrible. I've had this printer less than a month and two colors are out, and I haven't printed anything but black & white e-mail messages with almost no color. The printer gives good results but the ink seems to evaporate and the cartridges ain't cheap!Everything else works, but Epson printers are problematic. Print heads are in the machine and they fail quickly leaving you with a fax, scanner and a costly repair for a printer.Epson print quality is very good, but the company refuses to address problems that make their printers a throw-away. Buy these components separately and buy another type of printer.This one was a gift and I consider it junk because I now have to replace the entire thing."
2,"Great print quality, cartridge lasts one week","I love the print qulity from this printer, it is really great. It has a nice scanner too. However, one week of basic printouts from a home office uses up the cartridge. I am on my third set in less than a month, with genuine epson cartridges."
3,What Epson says about ink,"I just got off the phone with Epson support. After 2 days and maybe fifteen pages printed my color ink cartridges are reading only left. The person at Epson support indicated this is a known problem with the cartridges shipped with some of the printers. She indicated the problem was in the sensors and that they would eventually reset and read properly. She said we should not see this problem in replacement cartridges. In short they say its not amazingly fast ink consumption, it is bad sensors on the cartridges.This is of course according to Epson."
3,Nice and Loud,"This printer prints out beautiful prints on gloss paper, but it seems it wasn't made for the plain multi paper. The prints come out very dull and the colors don't stand out on it. The printer carries features that are very useful, for instance, the printer does not need a connection with a computer to print, and if it is connected to the computer it automatically picks out the picture folder in my documents and displays them on the mini monitor.It also has a copy feature and scan, which are pretty quick but also dull.The boot up is extremely slow (1 minute plus) and the printer is bulky and heavy.. I wouldn't recommend for the price I paid for it (180) but amazon seems to have a steal on it.."
1,"Ink sucker, shakey support, pop up hell, no slide printing.","The color ink which is expensive vanishes even when printing in black!? The black cartridge is shallow. The 'Epson Scan cannot be started' window pops up regularly. Support's instructions are complex. The scanner is OK. It does not do slides. It is slower than I antiicipated. Otherwise, it will just do as an all-in-one inkjet printer, needing laser backup if you do any quatity of text printing. I cannot seem to change number of stars but if I could, i would give it 2 and a half instead of 1."
1,Dreadful,"Save your money and avoid huge frustration. It doesn't want to work. You have to clean the heads (and use precious, expensive ink) almost daily. We've all had to deal with bad printers; this is the worst I've ever used."
1,garbage printer,"Nothing but problems,,,ing gobbler,,,the cartridge has a chip that shuts the cartridge down when its near empty ..the print head is part of the printer and when it cleans itself it uses lots of ink,,,this printer is going in the garbage"
1,Big Ink Guzzler!,"Epson should be ashamed of this product. I hope they are. It boarders on false advertising. Their website and specs state that the ink cartridges will last approx. 245 pages for the standard black cartridge and approximately 350 for the color cartridges. I have spent over $400 in cartridges over the last 8 mos. The cartridges will last for only approx. 20 standard pages (non-photo) at the most before they run out. If one cartridge is out...sorry, no printing at all, even in black, until it is replaced by an EPSON brand cartridge. This one is going in the garbage."
1,This Printer is a Scam!,"This printer guzzles ink faster than an SUV guzzles gas. In one month with minimal black and white printing (and almost no color) I have already put more money into ink than the printer is worth. The thing guzzles color ink even when you specify print in black only. I'm talking like every week it's running out of at least one color (and I'm printing on the order of a dozen pages a week).Epson is doing this to make money...most people don't think of ink when they're buying a printer, but it adds up very fast! Also note that you currently cannot get these cartridges refilled by a third party (Epson has made sure to that)!"
1,Epson Stylus CX6000 Nooooooo!,"If you buy this printer you will, like me, sorely regret it. As a lot of other reviewers have noted, they too were loyal Epson customers. My C86 was a workhorse, though I did feel the ink ran out kind of fast- I didn't know how good I had it. One reviewer felt that they had been held hostage by this printer. I know the feeling. You can't print in even B&W if one of the inks is out. The print heads are CONSTANTLY CLOGGED so you clean them- and then Voila', you have no ink left. This is the sorriest product that I've ever had. Epson is replacing mine for me with the CX7400 but I'm not holding my breath. What I really want is a different line of printers but they don't make ""refunds."" Oh and, don't bother with ink resetters on this model- the new T069 ink that it uses won't reset. By the way, I only gave it one star because it won't let me give it zero!!!!"
1,CX 6000 Rapid ink consumption and only epson cartridges,"Nice quality print, but 35 pages of text only, and the cartridge is empty. Will not recognize any cartridge but epson brand (I've had happy succes with inks4less in HP, cannon and brother printers). The printer simply doesn't ""acknowledge"" the other brand cartridges and will not print. 35 pages per $17 cartridge for text. I think this is headed for the trash, and just 3 weeks old. I too have had several epson printers over the past 20 years--this is my last"
1,Avoid this consumer gouging ink guzzling printer,"I purchased this multi cart printer cx6000 in the hopes of SAVING on ink. The opposite was true. ALL 3 color cartridges and most of the black were empty after about 9 pages of simple black text and 2 1/2 pages of ""wallet size"" prints with the quality set at medium which is the default setting. I lowered the quality to 1 notch above ""draft"" and I managed to double the life of my next set of cartridges which is still pathetic. I will never buy epson products again. This is outright thievery on their part. Epson printers suck up ink faster than an H1 Hummer sucks up gas!PS used cx6000 for sale!...very low mileage"
2,Please read before you buy this,"In general i guess is ok,the only problems it has is when you try to print pictures from a memory card it takes like 30 minutes of thinking before it actually shows the pictures in the screen, also i know everybody complains about the ink but in this case i ran out of the 3 color cartridige ink after i used 4 times to print letters in black only and two of then where in draft mode(i din't print a full color picture), after 4 prints thats it i need more ink.another thing is that it dosen't have a lot of options to choose from."
1,If I could rate it 0 stars I would,"Complete and utter garbage. Rip-off city. NO ONE SHOULD EVER BUY THIS PRINTER, IT IS POSSESSED BY INK DEMONS. They drink ink while you sleep!! 10 pages and all my color in k are out (and I was only printing black!)!?!?!? EPSON IS A RIP OFF ARTIST DONT BUY THEIR PRODUCTS. GARBAGE to the 1000th power. Do yourself a favor AND AVOID THIS THING LIKE THE PLAGUE!"
1,wish it worked,"The magenta ink cartridge does not fit. I have purchase 2 other magenta cartrdiges and neither one fits, so it was a complete waste of money."
2,No Driver for Intel-based Macs?!!,"Great printer/scanner (the CX7800--don't know where CX6000 came from all of a sudden!)--when it works. Does suck ink... but I was able to print 150 full-color letter-size Xmas cards without replacing cartridges. I am on my second CX7800--the first died after a simple paper jam. The current problem is: I have since upgraded from a Mac G4 to a MacBook Pro Intel-based laptop, and have spent HOURS installing/uninstalling re-downloading, resetting, restarting, etc. to make the recommended ""driver"" for this printer work, but IT DOES NOT SHOW UP!!! Now I wonder if it really even exists? Epson Support only repeats its same incomplete instructions without addressing the issue. I give up... and am on the lookout for a better solution from another company. Epson had its chances..."
2,"I know they make their profit on ink, but this is crazy","I have purchased several over the years and have always been happy with them. Epson provides good quality printing at a reasonable cost. I bought this one without doing any research because I could always rely on Epson in the past. Big mistake. I'm happy with the printing and copying function. I haven't done much scanning, but I what little I did seems okay for my needs. The problem, as everyone has said, is that the ink levels drop like a stone. The color levels are going done as fast as the black even though I haven't printed any color pictures. I have printed five or six web pages with some color and about 30 pages of black text. All four cartridges are done to 1/4 full. Without some serious attention to this problem by Epson, this will be my last Epson printer."
3,My Epson CX6000,"Well, I just purchased mine today, the installation was pretty easy,and it prints to regular paper fairly nicely. I put in a glossy sheet to print a photo and I was not satisfied with the quality, it came out faded looking and was not vibrant like that I would expect from an inkjet."
2,Everyone was right!,"I was on here researching a new printer. I read the reviews on this machine and decided to pass it by. Not two days later my husband brought one home! Now, I'm trying to find the best priced ink cartridges! I couldn't believe how fast it went! The thing literally said my ink was half gone after printing one picture!!! I'm hoping it might just be one of those things where it takes a bit extra to get going. Also, the print quality is good, but it's nothing fantastic. I'm considering going back to my 6 year old printer that did just as good of a job, and worked for 2 years of heavy printing before it's ink ran out.Also, for anyone considering this printer...keep in mind that it is more of a ""stand alone"" machine. Meaning it is a unit in and of itself made to work independently like an office copier. It can be hooked up to your computer and used, but it is not as user friendly as machines made to go with your PC."
4,"Good sourcebook, system should be better","From the back ot the book: ""Requires the use of Dungeons and Dragons Player's Handbook...""It would be more appropriate to use d20 Modern. The system is loosely d20 and could use a tune up. I think using d20 Modern rules with Farscape RPG as a sourecbook and guide would be best. Racial bonuses are askew and the classes are ill-conceived (PK Commandos have only average attack bonus!?).I LOVED/LOVE the show and am happy with the book because it has source material and backstory I've seen nowhere else.As far as playing the game, I plan on following my own advice and converting it to d20 Modern (maybe d20 Future when that comes out)."
5,awesom,This book is fantastic for Role players or just fans. I role play Chiana on Myspace or used to. And we were constantly grabbing dvd's or looking up information to make sure it was correct before we posted it. Now all I need is the Nebari Encyclopedia <3
5,"Great, challenging, fun",I usually don't do such a short workout but it's so intense and so fun and so HARD! I just run before I do it. You wont regret buying this one! Music is good. Very casual setting. One girl needs to take off her hat. Geez silly! Other than that distraction very very good workout.
4,Still prefer the other Turbo Jam workouts..,"Dont get me wrong, this gives you a great workout in a shorter time period, but I do prefer the other Turbo Jam workouts over this one. Ive been doing Turbo Jam for a while now, but during this workout I felt confused and had to stop and say, "" What?"" a few times. Im used to always knowing what moves are coming up. Still a good workout though and Im sure I'll be fine after doing it a few times."
5,Does what you need and then some,I bought this pocket pc used to use as an e-reader since the price didn't even compare to some of the e-readers available now. It also works great for listening to music and watching movies on the Windows Media Player. This device comes with wi-fi which is great for checking your e-mail and sending IMs where ever a hot spot is available without having to pay a monthly fee. And of course it works great for remembering important dates.
2,Not happy,Received the PDA but it's missing the stylus - not happy - this is definitely neededWill return the unit also the screen was dirtyI know it's used but at least cleaning up
2,It's not great. Much better books out there.,I saw it recommended on a forum I'm on and ordered it. It's more of a workbook format and there are much better marathon training books out there.
3,fun online game,"this game is not very fun playing tha computer, but is def a great game online. for the price you pay for this game. pretty good deal i think."
3,It Really is Worse,"This cd has the worst quality in the world. It sounds like it was recorded on a Fisher Price boombox! If the quality was as good as the last two songs, this would be the best cd ever. But its not. The guitar riffs are indistinguishable, and just sound like a blur. The catchiest songs on the cd are ""Rancid Sucks"", ""I Lit Your Baby on Fire"", ""Women, Natures Punching Bag"", ""Into the Oven"" and the last two songs. The last two songs are so awesome, if the rest of the cd wouldve only followed that path. All in all, still a good cd."
3,Extremely inept yet often entertaining and funny,"A.C. are one of the most infamous bands in the metal and hardcore underground. They're, um, ""revered"" for their extremely offensive yet often hillarious song titles and lyrics (just read the track listing if you want a laugh) than their actual music. To be honest that's completely warranted. A.C. are an incredibly inept grindcore band, with zero ability to conceive a memorable hook and one of the most shrill and obnoxious vocalists ever. However, if viewed as a parody of grindcore, this works a lot more. I'm not sure if Seth Putnam and crew wanted to be taken this way, but A.C. are often entertaining to listen to because of how terrible the music is. Still, this can only be played in very small doses before the joke wears thin, and when you have one A.C. album, you have them all."
5,This is a raw and graphic summary of the filth of everything,"Well A.C. did it again, who knew that this little band could go so far and reach such hights. There new album is a testemony to how dedicated to there music and the prisute of lirical and musical genuis."
5,lighten up,im might be twisted but when i first came across this album i laugh till my sides hurt just reading the song titles see for yourself. the hatred and white trash humor is what drew me in. not there talent so there not zeppelin. who cares there fun to listen to.if u want music about feeding starving children listen to u2 and shut up.and by the way that c.conrad guy i read his other reviews and he likes lenny kravitz and coldplay.nuff said.
1,correction,"Someone I know apparently played a small prank on me. He used my log-in on an earlier review. I am NOT a fan of this stupid band. This band is just noise. The lyrics and song titles might be funny but what's the point if you can't even understand them? The other review also stated that the singer and I are gay lovers. That sure as hell is not true. Their singer might be gay but I'm not. There's no talent on this cd whatsoever. This is just a group of rebellious teenagers who are at least in their 30's. Who knows how the hell they got signed to any record label? And to my friend who pulled the prank, payback's a bitch!"
1,i think they [stink],sure the song titles are funny and humorous but do these guys have much talent? i don't think so. they can barely play their instruments and they basically scream over three chord heavy riffs. when i want funny bands i listen to s.o.d. or gwar.
4,NO MARX,"This cd is glorious, but there is no MARX in it. There is no FOUCAULT, BAUDRILLARD, no anybody. Just some good ol' American grind w/ ludicrious lyrics."
1,I Can't Believe It.,"I'm generally not too phased by stuff, but this piece of cd plastic is going too far. Body by Auschwitz? I think you just lost all Jewish listeners. Insulting jewish prisoners? Sick. Moronic. Intolerable. All of their ""songs"" are not funny, or not even stupid. They don't belong on earth. I know some dumb goth freak is gonna cry from what I said, but I'm right. Any reviewer who gives this piece of cd trash over 1 star is garbage. Also, is it just me, or, can you not tell the difference between each track?"
1,Braindead.,"This is quite possibly the most retarded [garbage] Iv'e ever listened to. This makes junk like Cannibal corpse, Mortician, Pig destroyer, Agorophobic nosebleed, Regurgitate and the rest of the Grindcore\Gore metal scene look intelligent and technically proficient by comparison. This is just another gem for strung out, noise starved Grind fans. As far as track 19 goes, let's just put it this way: Eric Clapton is a real arist, unlike this no talent ""band"". You want to listen to a talented, yet very extreme piece of art? Then check out Hypocrisy's Osculum Obscenum. Chuck this garbage into the furnace and get a life."
1,Garbage,"Anyone who gives this 5 stars has horrible taste in music. Hell, anyone who gives this 2 stars has horrible taste in music.Don't buy this album. But if you already have, burn it."
1,wow,"i am very fond of this band and its extremely interesting how amazon lets you sample every single song. the samples are equal in quality to the low production as well as the songs themselves. how long do you think it took to make these songs? no revision whatsoever. i think the only satisfaction you'll have with this album is the lyrics which they include for you - although you can just see them over the internet. basically, nu-metal is even better than this if it comes to music. this is a true disgrace to grindcore and makes me reconsider the skill of other grindcore bands such as cannibal corpse (which i think suck just as much too). if you want to listen to real metal, try death or black metal or even thrash metal. avoid grindcore!!! i prefer melodic death the most"
1,It couldn't get any worse!,"What? No bad reviews? I'm shocked! I'd like to honestly say that this is the absolute worst band I have ever heard in my life! It's horrible, I can't believe these albums by this band were ever even made! By comparison, Cannibal Corpse sounds like the best band of all time! If you want to hear good music, listen to Metallica, Pantera, Iced Earth, Machine Head, Fear Factory, even Slayer, but don't spend even a nickel on this garbage!"
1,Music for morons.,"The people who rate this highly reveal their stupidity by their comments. I'm a pretty laid back guy but it is offensive and even worse, the music sucks."
2,Inboard Motor Installations,"This book was originally published in the late 70's and has not been updated. The motors, transmissions, and associated components are old, out of date, and in most cases the companies do not exist or have been taken over by other companies. Aside from that, the information format is good and gives one a basic knowledge of inboard motor installation. It wouldn't take much to bring this book up to date."
2,"Great Cable, bad quality control","This cable gave great video but was still a defective product. The colors on two of the connectors were swapped with respect to the colors on the opposite end. I had already installed this cable, into a difficult location, when I discovered it did not work. I checked continuity and had two of the three cables open to the other end so I assumed I must have damaged these connectors when pulling through some tight places. I decided to change them rs and, unfortunately, had already cut one of the ""bad"" connector ends before I discovered the colors were merely swapped. I verified this by checking the continuity of the cut connector, which was fine. The other ""bad"" cable worked fine when it was plugged into the right color. Now, I had to buy expensive compression fittings and an expensive compression crimping tool simply to rework something that did not actually need it. This expense and frustration should have never happened."
3,"Nice Unit - DON""T UPDATE IT!!!!","Im giving this 3 stars because it make a satisfying thud when it disintigrated against the wall.Appearenly the unit decided to update itself on the interwebs shortly after I connected it to my PC - Thanks to undocumented incompatibilities with windows 7, the firmware update failed and the unit essentially self destructed. HP was NO help trying to fix it (way past it's End-Of-Life) but that's the price you pay for buying stuff that's outta production.Nonetheless for the hour or so that it was operational, this thing was terriffic! Lightweight, easy to use and with a bright clear screen. I was also pleased that despite it being out of production for years it was brand new when it arrived, the price was fantastic, the seller shipped it quickly and it was exactly what I wanted. Such a shame technology doesn't play nice with itself sometimes.I'd recommend it, but DO NOT UPDATE IT!!!!!"
2,Bottom of Pan,"Presto 06620 11-Inch Electric SkilletAfter only a few uses, the non-stick portion wore off around the heating element on the bottom of the skillet. Very disappointed. Still works but have to spray bottom of pan with Pam!"
3,Works fine,Had one before and liked it so bought this one to replace the one I had. The only thing about it (all of them do it) is the temp keeps going up and down it is not consitant on the temp you put it on.
2,Lasted two years don't bother.,"We loved this skillet while it worked. The handles had to be tightened every couple of months. We are just two people, didn't use it too often yet it just quit working yesterday."
1,Disappointing,"I was looking for an electric skillet that could accomidate 2 cut-up frying chickins and easy to clean. Well, this skillet is a little to delicate for my liking. It fries up that much chicken or 4 halibut steaks just fine, but I accidently made a hairline scratch on the coated cooking surface and it was never the same. With each use and washing that scratch got wider and longer until small patches of the coating began coming off and exposeing the bare metal beneath, and of course any food coming into contact with that would stick. The disintegration of the surface continued no matter how carefully I washed it until I just threw it away. I should add that the electric cord is only about 2 feet in lenght! So you must cook right next to an outlet. I prefer a hardier piece of equipment not something I have to pamper."
2,Presto Electric Skillet,"I was disappointed in this electric skillet. It has no vent on lid, it has no rubber feet. Also, it does not heat evenly."
5,Excellent electric skillet,I have had several other brands for the past years -- this one is by far the best. Great size - deep enough and extra wide. I am very pleased and glad I switched brands.
4,need improving on the handles,Cooked well. Temperature is accurate.Had trouble with the handle coming loose after second time using. My husband put a lock washers before screwing it down to keep the screws from backing out.Had the same skillet in the past and it did the same thing.This is a serious problem with the skillet because the handle could work it way off when empting a hot dish.Also it would be nice to have a vent.
5,Best Electric Skillet Ever,"This skillet is exactly what we needed. It's got a lot of cooking surface, easy to clean and a heavy, tight fitting lid. (The lid isn't the common stamped sheet metal usually found but instead two layers with insulation inbetween.) Temperature accuracy is dead-on and cooking any dish is easier than on stove-top. It's large size makes it difficult to store, but it's worth it. I highly recommend the Presto 6850 electric skillet."
3,"Cooks well, poor no-stick surface","I recently bought a Presto fry pan (Model 5136, similar to this one) new on Ebay. On the good side, it heats up quickly & does a good job cooking stuff. It is also good for warming food.On the bad side, the non-stick surface isn't very good. Even though I use only rubber utensils, it still scratches easily. And the coating has started to flake off around some of the scratches. Even though I don't use the highest temperature settings(I use 375 & less) the coating over the heating ring has started to bubble. And after it bubbles up, it starts to flake off."
2,A little disappointed,"I was expecting this skillet to be more heavy duty. It heats higher where the coil is, so frying is uneven. If it had a thicker base I don't think that would happen. It also cycles on and off I suppose to maintain a certain temperature. But I would prefer a constant temp. This is the first electric skillet I've owned so maybe my expectations were too high or maybe I should get a more expensive one. Who knows? So I just use it for things like browning large quantities of ground meat, or veggies, or something with a lot of sauce. I'll continue to use it, but I wouldn't buy another one like this."
4,Good replacement for my old Presto,"Got this to replace my worn out model. I like to cook lots of big stir fries, and this does the job. The old one lasted nearly 15 years, so I hope the new one will. I did notice however that the handles are not so sturdy, and they were a bit difficult to assemble. I had to find an alternative screw (one of the four provided did not fit) for attaching the legs. It cooks wonderfully ...but the temps on the dial seem miscalibrated (200 sizzles more like 400). I cook by ""nose"" rather than strictly by temperature, so that was not so big an issue. This is a hard to find size, and that feature was the deciding one for me. NOTE: Update a year later...the legs on this skillet are not very sturdy, as the older model's were. We learned the hard way. Now we can't replace just the legs. Other than that is has held up well, and the interior surface is as good as new. Of course we do ""baby"" it by cleaning only with a soft sponge."
1,do not buy this product,I give this product 0 stars. It is a rip off and not worth your money. The picture makes this product look like a nice toy but the real thing is a piece of junk that looks like it cost 5 cents to make.
1,"Not as pictured, very dissapointed!","I ordered 2 of these as gifts. I will not be giving them, and will have to find a replacement. They are junk! Tiny, not nicely made, and not worth the price I paid. The back of the whistles is stamped with ""Oriental Trading.com"". When I look on that site I find the whistles I received, and they are sold in quantities of 12 for $10! I'm not happy with this purchase at all and will be contacting Amazon to see about returning them. Do not waste your money!"
2,You get what you pay for,"I ordered this as a gift for my nephew who loves trains. It's difficult to get the whistle to produce sound at all, and when it does, the sound it makes is super weak and doesn't really sound like a train. I should've spent a couple of extra bucks to get something that sounds good."
3,Cute gift,"My husband is a high school band director, and the school did a production of ""The Music Man""this yearwith him as the pit orchestra conductor. The opening scene of the musical is a train scene. As a cute memento, I got him this train whistle, wrote the name of the play and the dates it ran on the blank side, and had his orchestra sign a program for him. He loved it!"
4,cool toy,"Good sound, good textureThe opening is very wide, though, for a 3 years old, the age of my son."
1,Does not work,"I may have received one made on a Friday afternoon because it does not whistle very loud and most definitely does NOT sound like a train, more like a plastic gym whistle without the marble inside. But, it was inexpensive..."
2,Doesn't really work,All of the train whistle toys I've heard actually sound like a low train whistle. This one is very high pitched and just sounds annoying.
2,Off key whistle,Its my own fault for buying this. I read the other reviews but decided to order it regardless. This whistle is off key. I had a train whistle when I was a kid and this sounds nothing like it. This product makes a more of a high pitched whistle thats really harsh on the ears. Its just off key and its annoying to listen to. Do yourself a favor and find a better made train whistle.
4,Sounds Like a Choo-Choo,"My son makes the choo-choo sound when I play the ""what sound does the train make?"" and I thought he would enjoy this toy. He likes it when I blow it and he gets fairly excited. However, it does require an amount of wind pressure to effectively make this toy work and he cannot make the sound himself. Given the low cost I think it was well worth it anyway."
1,didnt make a good noise,i got this for a friend.. thinking it was like the old wooden hollowed out train whistles.. its soild and hardly makes a noise when you blow into it
2,Baby train whistle,Too high pitched and small to be an authentic true sounding train whistle. A whistle nonetheless. There are better ones out there.
1,not what i thought,"its teeny tiny!! thought it was bigger. plus the holes weren't open, but closed so it didnt make a loud or good whistle sound at all. kinda disappointed."
1,Don't Buy!!,This toy is worthless. It sounds NOTHING like a train but rather a high pitched whistle. I wish I had read the other reviews first.
2,Disappointment all around,"There is only one whistle. My fault that I didn't catch the ""one"" word in the description. All images show two. I only needed one. But I was still annoyed... until I tried it. This whistle is difficult to blow. I can't imagine my young children will be able to use it if I find it difficult. It doesn't sound good either; I'd say it sounds harsh and shrill. All around disappointment."
1,Shipped the wrong whistle!,We ordered three whistles for the kids coming to our baby's baptism. They arrived today and 1 of the whistles is almost half the size of the other 2 whistles (which are as shown in the picture description). Am I really supposed to try to give three kids whistles where one of them is smaller than the others...we all know how THAT is going to turn out! Amazon.com fulfilled this order and they really messed this one up!
1,not a train whistle,"this does not come close to sounding like train whistle - what a waste of money.... Threw it in the trash, not worth the shipping price (and headache) for the refund."
1,Doesn't work,I should have paid more attention to the reviews. This whistle doesn't work *at all.* It looks nice but it does nothing.
4,Rooty-Toot-Toot,"It's a whistle for Pete's sake; you blow, it toots. What could go wrong. It still works and hopefully, will continue until the child outgrows it."
1,Terrible,"This whistle looks like all the other train whistles and cost approximately the same, but the quality is not the same. It does not sound like a train whistle at all and that is only when I can get it work. Poorly made."
1,are you kidding?,train whistle? No. Whistle? Yes.IF you want a whistle that sounds like a train - keep moving. As an ordinary whistle this is barely acceptable too.
5,Magic!,"I call this my magic cream because it softens, tames and STYLES my thick, coarse, unruly hair all by itself - no need to blow dry. Some call my hair naturally curly. To me it's naturally wild. Don't want to ever use anything else to style or tame this hair. Nice smell too. Be careful to not use too much."
4,Playtraining Your Dog,"Got a rescue dog that did not know how to play. Within a week of my reading the book, my dog is now rolling a ball around the living room; picking it up and tossing it. Success!"
2,"Not bad, but not the best you can do.","I was frankly rather disappointed by this book. I love the writing style, and the author's anecdotes about showing her dogs are hilarious. Unfortunately, I was expecting more actual ideas for games you could play with your dog that would motivate or teach him, and there isn't much that's new in this book. Also, as a clicker trainer, I find the fact that the author claims to support learning by positive reinforcement to be mildly amusing, since she's miles away from what most of us would call by that name. (I got The Culture Clash at the same time as this book, and the difference is striking.) To sum up, I think this was a useful, cutting-edge book... for 1986."
5,The best narrative of Lincoln's life,"Everyone has their favorite one-volume biography of Lincoln. This is not just mine, but many others' as well. Reason: its narrow focus--the man himself, what he saw, knew, did, and thought, from birth to death. No grand historical sweep here, no psycholgical deconstruction, no ""lessons"", for historians, or future presidents, or anyone else. Just clean, utterly credible narrative.Professor Donald was 76 years old when he published this work. He immersed himself in the Abraham Lincoln Papers, which had been sealed for eighty years, until 1947. He had written or co-written ten previous books about Lincoln and the Civil War era. That deep learning gave him the confidence to write this book with particluar clarity and force.When Michaelangelo was asked how he carved his ""David"", he is said to have answered, ""It was already there, in the marble. I just carved away all that was not David."" Here, Donald has carved away all that is not Lincoln, and the result is sublime."
5,Lincoln by Donald - Excellent,I have read many books on Lincoln over the years and this is one of the great ones along with Team of Rivals.
1,Review of Audiobook,"Having just enjoyed McCullough's Truman, this audiobook was disappointing. Although the isolated comments about vignettes contained in the other reviews seem generally true, the overall book seemed insufficiently cohesive. The story seemed fragmented in a way that made it difficult to follow any overarching theme. The story line failed to move along in a coherent and timely manner. The content overall also seemed superficial in that it failed to convey adequately the great issues underlying the Civil War conflict."
4,Exciting read,"Great book yielding to all the details of decisions made along the way of Lincoln's life. His adventures of early manhood, the early years of his political life, and the his thoughtful years in the presidency."
3,"Scholarly, Not Entertaining","Lincoln was a born storyteller; Herbert Donald was not. I enjoyed the first part of the book (Lincoln's early years), but once Lincoln was into politics, the biography was no longer about Lincoln. Rather, it was about the politics and people surrounding him. I wanted to learn about Lincoln's life beyond what his political life entailed, and Donald left most of that out, with very little discussion of his wife and children. To add to my disappointment, the writing was unbelievably difficult to read. Sentences were long, written in both modern language and with the heavy use of quotations. It was often a chore to ""translate"" the meaning when thoughts were interrupted by commas and quotes. There were some interesting tidbits throughout the book, but overall, I was glad to discover that half of 22,000 kindle pages were references and weren't necessary to read. I don't regret the hours I put into reading the book, but I am glad I'm finished."
5,An outstanding book on an outstanding leader,"I have not read enough biographies about Abraham Lincoln to claim that this one is the best but after reading Mr. Donald's book it is hard to imagine a better work. Donald explores his subject fully and by removing himself (and letting the story flow uninterrupted), he allows the reader to connect more deeply with Lincoln. Donald doesn't heap praise on Lincoln or substantiate any myths, but this only heightens his credibility for the larger picture. Even with the myths dispersed, the reader will gain a great appreciation of one of our greatest presidents."
4,An Inspirational Biography of a Great Man,"Donald's biography of Lincoln is an inspiring and fascinating account of the man and President. The book clearly portray's Lincoln's personal humility, clear understanding of the Constitution and vision for the Union and people. It is a must read for those interested in U.S. history. The founding fathers (Washington, Jefferson, Madison, etc.) gave birth to our nation and constitution. Lincoln put it into practice and gave us a new understanding of ourselves."
4,Great insight to a great man,Having always been a history buff found this book easier to follow than many of the books written about Lincoln. He was a brilliant man who proved to be aa great leader using common sense in solving problems.
4,Informative,Interesting book and I am taking my time reading it. It is well written and worth giving it a lot of attention...
5,Lincoln,"This was an excellent read. I was looking for something that gave me more insight into the man than just his politics and Civil War decisions. This book gave me everything I was looking for. I didn't actually need all the political, etc. details, but I realize that comes with the territory. I recommend this book to anyone who wants an inside look at the man."
5,Now He Belongs to the Ages,"Dr. Donald's book is an excellent one volume biography of our greatest President, an historical figure of truly Biblical stature, who led the American people through the epochal struggle that ended the practice of human slavery in this country. It should be required reading."
3,Slow going,I am not completely through the book yet but so far I am enjoying it. The beginning of his life is very boring reading but it eventually builds up and gets interesting when he starts getting into politics. The author is very detailed in everything to a point where I tend to skip the details that do not contribute to the story.
2,"Definitive, but . . .","I read this book a couple of years ago. I've heard it described more than once as the ""definitive"" Lincoln bio, but it's not the most readable. I don't insist that the history I read be easy and light, but this book was a bit too dense and detailed for me, and the writing style was too dry. Parts were interesting, but I got seriously bogged down in the middle. There have to be Lincoln bios out there that would be of more interest to the general reader. Any recommendations?"
2,Having problems,"Having problems reading this book---I read about 50 pages, put it down, read another book, started again,put it down, reading Meacham's great biography of Jackson and I'm not convinced I can go back to this dry,exhausting biography--it is too detailed with far too many unimportant characters and associations.Lincoln was not a boring man, and this is a very boring biography---it is all there but way too much morethan one needs."
3,Excellent book needs better editing,"The author's balanced approach on Lincoln's family life, the political climate and struggles in conduct of war is excellent in contrast to more mythological treatments of Lincoln. The book presents a good picture of political maneuvering, not only in the 1800s, but also in the present. Politics is by nature an uncivil process.Content choices are good, but constant misuse of the word ""like"" in place of the appropriate ""such as"" is an irritant throughout the book. Obviously, the writer (and/or editor) need some instruction.This is unfortunately a common error, but there were so many instances of it that it got in the way of my reading. More attention to alternative sentence construction would have improved it. Nevertheless, I do recommend the book. The author's reference list speaks to the balance achieved in this biography."
5,Lincoln,This is a good book worth reading. I gives you a better understanding of the man at the center of a black chapter in American history where brother fought against brother.
4,"Excellent, maybe too stiff.","Essential single volume life of Lincoln brings to light the complexity of the problems he faced, and I'm convinced he might be the greatest man of all time.Would recommend for serious history students, not for the casual reader. Though I admire the restraint and discipline of the writing, it's on the dissertation side of entertainment. Left me craving some literary flourish, drama, and comedy relief."
4,Lincoln History,I bought this book to read during my treadmill walks. I'm surprised how quickly time passes. It's an easy read and I'm learning a lot about the life of Abraham Lincoln.
4,"Lincoln, the man, but not the political figure","Herbert does a great job of sharing the real Lincoln and that which contributed to the individual doing a difficult job. Other biographies of this great American tend to only look at selected episodes in Lincoln's life. This book, rather, attempts to share his life more broadly. As a result, you are treated to a view of the man that is more complete and less focused only on the tragedy of the Civil War. So, if you a political historian this book will seem life fluff. If, however, you are an American wanting to learn, this book will do a great job of showing you how much Lincoln suffered during his life and how he dealt with these issues. After reading this book, you should have a whole new appreciation for our most tragic president."
3,Disappointing Book from Brilliant Author,"David Donald has for years produced many brilliant histories. This volume is not one of them. It may have been written with ""Best Seller"" tag in mind, it may be meant for the largest popular readership. If so it succeeds. It is not written for the student of Lincoln and the civil War who is looking for dresh insight into the man and his times."
4,Lincoln,"Great book, wonderful condition and fast shipping. This made a wonderful Christmas gift. Thank You."
5,Excellent Book on the Greatest President!!,"This was a fantastic book of America's greatest president. Donald's account of Lincoln paints a full picture of the man few knew little about, from the pain and suffering of Lincoln's youth to his struggles to become a great leader. The personal side of Lincoln is brought to light in great detail. This is an excellent book and I recommend it to all to learn more about greatest president."
5,Must have read a different book!!,I'm not sure what book the other reviewer here read but the book I read is the FUNNIEST of the recent Destroyers. The Hollywood satire is some of the best since Murphy quit doing them. Remo is as dumb as ever and doesn't even know when an army has invaded America and Chuins visit to Hollywood is worth all the gold in Sinanju! (Chuin would obviously disagree about this). Read this book and decide for yourself!
2,A far cry from the early heights,"I have read almost all of the books in this series and this one is nowhere near the best. Compared to the early books, this one is pale and weak. The plot might have been OK for 100 or 150 pages, but there's at least 150 pages of boring filler material in this one; besides, a very similar idea was used in another book not so long ago. Although slightly better than some of the other recent editions, the satire is still strained and unfunny. The characters are reduced to caricatures who exercise their ""trademark"" behaviors too often, like Remo absently rotating his wrists or Smith's grey suit. Lastly, the racial and scatological jokes are the product of laziness and a severe underestimation of the readers. I love the Destroyer series, but I am finding myself more and more disgusted by the low quality of the current books."
1,poor door spring closing system,Everything works very well except for the door. The spring doesnot hold the door tight enough rendering the oven inoperable.I've been unable to locate anyone who can supply me with areplacement. Same problem a different model years ago but I'm notsure it had the same type of closure. Do not recommend anyonepurchase this item.
4,Great fryer,"Good fryer, nice size, very easy to clean (has removal oil pan that can be placed in dishwasher); my only complaint is unit is kinda slow to reach desired temperature."
3,Good price --- OK product,"The reason we bought this was because it was the cheapest amoung the deep friers. It doesnt get very hot and that gets annoying, seeing that it takes way too long to cook."
3,No timer on this deep fryer,"I received the deep fryer and think it is a nice size and is easy to clean. I did notice that there is no timer on this model. I think that this type of household appliance should have some type of auto shut-off to prevent overheating. I would not recommend this to anyone. If I had known that there was no timer on this, I would not have bought it.D H"
5,The best,This is easily the best series of books ever written. If you are a fantsay of the junuera or just appreciate a great story then I hightly reccomend it.
5,Sword of Truth Series,"I read this series last year when i was in the 8th grade. I thought that the series would never be finished. It ended in the sixth book with a good idea of what would happen, but i felt the story could use an ending provided by Terry Goodkind himself. I have the utmost respect for anyone who could ever paint such a vivid and powerful story. This is one of the best stories i have read. I look forward to reading the 7th book to see how he ties the story to a conclusion. I have no doubt in my mind that the book will be bad."
1,Terrible,"I have been a serious reader of fantasy novels and fiction in general for many years. The vast majority of the time, I walk away from a book with a good feeling. In other words, I like most things I read. No book has left me with a WORSE feeling than this one. Every character was a tired cliche...Goodkind followed the ""HOW TO WRITE A FANTASY NOVEL"" guidelines to a tee. It was generic and boorish. And not surprisingly, I predicted the exact outcome of the book, how the hero would ""cleverly"" outwit the villian, while I was still 200 pages from the end! I hated it. Horrible. The closest thing Goodkind had to an imagination here was a nice title."
4,The first 4 are brilliant....,"The first 4 books in this series deserve 5 stars each. A very 'real' fantasy world with 'real' heroes and a fast moving pace, and the all important love-theme.The fifth is terrible, a desperate attempt at a complete change in direction, to bridge the gap between the 4th and 6th books. It has no story line, most of the characters are dull, irrelevant and doomed to die anyway. However, the first books are so good that you'll probably want to buy this as well once you've read them. My advice is to risk the tempation and go straight from 4 to 6 as that picks up the pace again. The 5th book is just not necessary, not even as a link between the two."
5,Excellent Literature,"The book as all previous Terry Goodkind books is excellent. No writer, except maybe David Eddings, have yet reached the magnificance that is Terry Goodkind. Even Robert Jordan with Wheel of Time is Seriously Lacking.This book scillfully crafts the further tales of Richard and Kahlan, which started in The Wizard's First Rule"". If you enjoyed the previous books in the series, then be sure to pick up this one."
4,Good value for money,"I have a set of Calphalon stainless and it's worked well for me. The selling point was the see-through glass lids. It's held up well over the past couple of years. However, despite teh 'stay cool' handle claim, you have to watch out because they do get hot. The construction is pretty sturdy as well; I prefer this to their anodized line."
4,"Really good, but","I just received this concert and actually haven't watched it yet, I know its good because of the live cd that comes with it. I haven't watched the live show because of a regions error that came up when I put in the disc, it has to be played on a player that plays regions 2,3,4, &5,or all regions, this is something I have never heard of. I just wanted to warn everyone to check this out before U buy it."
4,Super Reader,"Pigeons are bad, especially when carrying bubonic plague.The Spider escapes one fight with the help of a parasol!The Black Death wants to use bubonic plague to blackmail the city, starting with a dog sent to infect and kill some children, an outbreak at the stock exchange, some random attacks on the street.The Spider is caught twice, once by The Black Death, and once, as Wentworth, by the police, with the commissioner believing him to be The Spider. A crazy stunt lets him escape, Nita and Apollo the great dane come to his rescue a couple of times, and eventually they track the miscreant down.It doesn't end well for him, as The Spider literally strangles the life out of him. Some of the villain's gloating was cleverly recorded on tape by The Spider, planting evidence that Wentworth is now in the clear."
3,Speaker wire,"This is good quality wire, I recieved 100 feet of copper, oxygen free, 16 gauge wire. Exactly as described. But however, if you look close at the picture of the item, it clearly says 500 feet on the side of the spool."
2,Too small,It was too small for the tacoma. Direct me to a longer one.As a result splash of mud is still coming back on the back section. How can this be corrected.
1,You get what you pay for.,"Very flimsy plastic, with silver letters instead of the white on the original, and were not close to the form or factor of the original mud flaps. Buyer beware. Toyota charges about $100 for a replacement so I thought I'd give these a try. Save your money."
1,Where's the pepper?,"As a professional chef I bought two large Peugots for my staff and assumed that when after a month, we could barely get pepper out of them that it was staff abuse and not a poor product. I bought the small one displayed here for the house and have found similar problems: You have to grind endlessly to get enough pepper to season a simple tomato sauce. Whether it's a design flaw or just poor craftsmanship I've had nothing but frustration with several Peugot models. I'm writing this review while logged on to buy from MIU France."
5,Beyond any superlatives I can think of,"The Millennium Calendar is literally a coffee table book in my house, but we can't wait to read a new one every day - we've each read through the whole thing twice! It's hilarious, and very well put together with all the trivia for the past millennium. Fantastic job! Gary Larson continues his tradition of amusement excellence!"
1,"Awful - not remotely ""scary"" like the other ""poster"" claims","Slow pacing, bad direction and acting - this movie was boring from start to finish. And as is the case with these low budget stinkers, you get the fake ""reviews"" by people who worked on it in here. The one other review by someone called ""nymus"" praising this as ""scary!"" is someone who has one other review - ""Summer Scars"" and guess what? Both ""movies"" were directed by someone named ""Julian Richards."" No other reviews. Just two by that guy. So that should tell you who ""nymus"" is. I've said it before, I'll say it again, there should be some rule in Amazon and IMDB that people who worked on these little videos cannot ""review"" them. It's unethical. Keep that in mind when you see reviews like ""nymus's"""
5,Best of the Many Available,"We've been using this model, or one close to it, for over 20 years. Yes, it can drip occasionally, but with a little care in handling, that is not a problem. When you pull the carafe out to pour, do so at a right angle to the removable filter basket and you will not dislodge the basket. It makes excellent coffee, does so fast, and keeps it hot for your continuing pleasure. We've been searching for a new coffeemaker as a backup and have bought and returned several (Black and Decker, Mr. Coffee). The Mr. Coffee was the poorest design I've ever seen. Water (or hot coffee) spilled everywhere. Proctor-Silex seems to know what they are doing with this model -- simple design, good results. Don't spend more and don't go for gadgets. This is your coffeemaker!"
1,Dangerous,My wife bought this piece of junk without consulting me. After putting up with it for way too long I finally bought a good coffee maker and gladly threw this thing away. It is cheaply made and frankly dangerous. When you remove the carafe the filter holder comes out and hot grounds and coffee spill out. This is very dangerous. This has to be the worst coffee make we have ever had. It replaced a Braun KF-187 which I had for years and liked but is discontinued. I spent money on a Capresso MT500 Plus and I love it. I'll be reviewing it after I've had it a little longer.
5,Good Exercise Bike,"I bought this bike right after I tore my ACL and was facing surgery the following week. I spoke to several physical therapist I worked with and they reccommended an upright bike for post ACL repair. I was not able to actually use it until 4 weeks post-op but when I did it really helped me get back my range of motion. It is a good solid magnetic resistance bike, you can also use low to no resistance like I did following my knee surgery. I have recently been able to increase the resistance and it really tones your legs and buns quickly, and you will burn calories and sweat when you do! I prefer this bike over the recumbent bikes because you get a better calorie burn, however if you have a back injury I would suggest the recumbent bike(my physical therapist explained that it takes the pressure off your spine). Overall I am very pleased with this bike. Mine is the Gold version and I paid $128 total."
4,Basic Cycle Works Just Fine,"I have had my Marcy Mag Cycle for about 2 months now. It works just fine for a half hour to hour workout watching TV. It is quite impressive for the price - there are others costing double, triple, even more. Easy enough to assemble; there are only about ten parts and it is obvious how they all fit (except maybe the cable which takes a minute or so to understand). Quite sturdy and durable for an adult male, but easy to port around front set of wheels. The screen gives basic time, pace, miles, and calories, but it isn't very backlit. You can adjust the tension, but many of the lower tension levels all seem about the same to me. If you want a basic unit, this one is it, and the price is great."
4,Great workout for a small bike,"This is a great little stationary bike. It is easy to assemble except the foot peddles are hard to screw on, the handle bars and seat are easily adjusted. Gives a great work out...the tension range is just right for my needs, and the size is perfect for small spaces. It is light enough that it can be moved from one place to another without any problem. I gave this 4 stars rather than 5 because the seat is uncomfortable, wish it had better padding and could be tilted up or down. There is not a water bottle holder...not that this is a big deal but I drink alotof H2O when I workout. If you want a great stationary bike...for the money this is it."
4,Good value!,"For the price, this is an excellent no frills exercise bicycle. I had no issues putting it together, but it does take 2 people. It doesn't take up much room and is easy to move around. I got it because I have a bad knee and wanted to be able to jump on it and use it while watching TV. The tension is a little stiff even at the lowest sitting, but I am working my way up to longer times. Other members of my family will jump on it and exercise for 10-15 minutes. So this is a good thing!!!"
5,Nice bike,This bike is comfortable and quiet. I purchased for my wife but we all like to ride it. Great product.
3,Solid,"The bike seems to be very adequate for meeting one's exercise needs. I agree with previous reviewers, the instructions are very vague and hooking the tension cable can be difficult. The key is to loosen the nut on one end of the cable, the instructions do not tell you this when hooking up the bike. I spent nearly a half hour trying to figure out how it was supposed to work, and worrying I was going to break it. I dont think the seat is all that bad, it's not as uncomfortable as you would believe based on earlier reviews.Bike is fairly quiet, sturdy, and the computer has everything you would need to track calories, time, distance. It doesnt deserve more than 3 stars because its pretty much your standard exercise bike, and doesnt have the bells and whistles that more expensive bikes have."
3,works well,"I have been pleased with the bike...assembly was quick and easy. Even with my infant and toddler ""helping"" it took only minutes. I only wish the seat were more comfortable...I ride twenty or thirty minutes a day and the seat is not great, but manageable."
3,So far so good,"I just received this bike. The good thing was,Amazon's super saving scheme could get it shipped for free. After reading the reviews , i was little concerned with the assembling, but could complete most of the assembly alone. Yes, the resistance chord is a little tricky one, but again the reviews helped on this part. The vendor should probably think about adding the link to reviews for help on assembling :)Overall the assembly wasn't a bad experience. The display is not very sphistcicated and i am not really sure on what basis it calculates the calories without knowing my weight. The seat is ok, but not very comfortable.Frankly with this price, i didn't expect it to be more than what i got. All i wanted what to be able to perform light exercise and consume some calories at home watching TV,and does provide the same."
4,Very Pleased,"I've been very pleased with this exercise bike so far. Shipping was quick, assembly wasn't that bad (definitely loosen the tension knob before connecting the wires as others have mentioned) and the ride is smooth and quiet. For the price, this bike is just what I was looking for."
4,Not for short people,This exersize bike was easy to asemble but the seat setting is more than 30 inches tall. which makes it a little dificult to mount.
3,Cheaper at Walmart,$98 at Walmart and if you ship to local walmart store there is no shipping costs. Too late for me as the shipment will arrive in a few days. Good thing I placed the order when it was selling for only $5 more.Unfortunately I placed the order 2 months ago and had to wait until now for shipment.
1,not so cheap rubbish,"A lesson learned: cheap is the new expensive... it lasted less than a week before one of the pedals got stuck and had to be hammered out, damaging the screw thread in the process.... now I am left with the quandry.... just throw the whole thing in the dumpster where it belongs or try to get a spare part and fix it...."
5,"Great, basic bike","I rated this bike as a 5, because it suits my needs perfectly. It is a basic, no-frills bike, and that's what I needed. It is the 2nd one I've bought [for different locations]. I've had the first one for a couple of years, and, although it doesn't get heavy use, I haven't had any problems with it. I have arthritis in my hips and a daily 20 min. ride greatly reduces the pain."
3,"Great exercise bike, however....","This bike requires assembly..as I was aware of -- but be forewarned! The resistance chord that requires attachment in the interior of the bike is EXTREMELY grueling to connect! I thought there might have been a defect in the part and I was about to throw everything back into the box and send it back...but with patience (along with some aggravation)I managed to get it connected. Also, the bike is not blue and gray, as pictured.. it's gold and gray.. and the gel seat that is recommended to go with this bike is not the correct size for this bike. it's too small and it doesn't fit over the seat.."
5,Nice bike,"Amazon delivered the bike on time and not damaged. The assembly took about an hr. I only used it once, but it seems like a good product."
4,Well Built Cycle,"The cycle is heavy built and works very smoothly. The only thing it does not do is accumulate mileage as the last one we had, which is important to my wife."
3,Hard to capture live performance,"This is the CD version of the 1968 special Elvis did after being out of the public eye for a while. There is always something special about a live performance and Elvis was one of the best. However, I was disappointed in this CD for several reasons:--He doesn't play it straight on some of the cuts and while that may be entertaining on the DVD, it is not on the CD.--There are several repeats of songs. If you like those, great. If you don't, endure.--Too much talk with some of it forced. Elvis says at one point that he is supposed to talk about the evolution of rock and does so without a lot of enthusiasm.I enjoy Elvis' music and consider him one of popular music's greatest stage performers. The DVD of his comeback special might reinforce this. Unfortunately, the CD comes up short."
2,It has too much talking,the cd has to much talking and the songs are not full. buy a cd with the whole and real song
5,WOW! Incredible!,"All I can say is WOW! This double CD collection is absolutely the best. I have every record album he has recorded, including the original '68 Comeback record and this collection of those recordings with most of them previously unreleased is just incredible. Any Elvis fan will be happy with this."
2,A mediocre addition to the burgeoning mixed-race literature,"Zack comes up with really dynamic concepts for books. I wish her career well. However, I wasn't thrilled by this book. Zack edits an anthology on ""microdiversity"", basically investigating the fac that there is more diversity within races than between races and mixed-race individuals substantiate this. Zack basically goes back and forth on whether racial categories should be used strategically or obliterated. The anthology has some interesting pieces from Native Americans. It is lacking on pieces from Latinos. It is very academic: everyday fans of Maria Root's books may be stumped here. The book ends with this awkard, unnecessary essay by a Jewish woman that is not even bi-religious. This book isn't terrible, it's just that there are better books on multiraciality out there."
5,unearth rules,"ok the first guy who reviewed this basically took 4000,0000 paragraphs to say what i can see in just a few sentences: this is a new release from unearth, but not their next official album. The first half of the album is stellar live tracks and the next half of the album is their hard to find EPs. All in all, a good release from unearth. the live tracks sound good and the eps display a raw, powerful unearth. if you don' tknow who this band is, they are an american metal band who have huge swedish metal influences."
4,Great Popcorn popper,This hot air popper is great!!! Leaves very little kernels unpopped. It's quicker and healthier than the microwave. I only wish they have an on/off switch.
3,Popcorn Popper does the job.,"This is an OK popcorn popper. Nothing special. It typically leaves about 1/2-1 tablespoons of un-popped kernels. Some quick tips:1. Don't try to make less than 1/2 cup of popcorn. I've tried several times to make less than 1/2 cup. More kernels fly out than are popped.2. The butter better be soft if you are using the butter cup to melt it. Even then, it may not do the job all the way.3. Watch out for kernels that are ejected then POP in the bowl. Sends other kernels/popcorn flying all around."
1,What the heck it melted,I popped my second batch of pop corn and went to get it. The butter was not complete melted in butter melting/measuring cup. So I talked to a man about a dog and five minutes later I found this:[...][...]The entire cover was melted.What the heck? I don't give a good god damn if I left it on all night. Why did the cover melt? The reality is the thing was on for 15 minutes.
1,Wouldn't recommend.,"I received this popper for Christmas, but if I had bought it, I would have returned it. Compared to my previous (25+ year old) popper, it takes an inordinately long time to pop. While attempting to pop, the hot kernels are bouncing and flying out of the very large opening. Then, the remaining kernels that don't pop are actually burnt. I would have rated this popper 0 stars, but I was forced to put at least 1."
5,love it,"I've been using this popper weekly since purchase and it has not yet failed on me. It's fast, not nearly as noisy as I thought it would be, and my cats are fascinated by the popping action. Great fun, and a tasty lo-cal snack."
1,Really Hot/Not fun to use,"We purchased this popcorn popper this week and I am returning it. It throws terribly hot unpopped kernals out of the chute .I have small kids and one of the kernals burned me so I would not have them anywhere near this. The popcorn is absolutely tasteless. We used Redenbacher corn . I'd much rather have popcorn less often and have some that is much better tasting than this. If you do use this, have a very deep bowl to put underneath the chute. A large baking bowl will not do it. It also will not melt cool/cold butter..it has to be soft to begin with. This was not a fun thing to do or use, especially with kids. I'd never let them use this. It may be healthier popcorn when it is popped with hot air, but other than that........"
1,80% UNPOPPED KERNELS,"This popper is awful! After putting in about a half cup of kernels, AT LEAST 80% of them flew out of the machine before if was even hot enough to pop the rest of the kernels. The fan at the bottom blows all of the kernels out of the chute. Save your money and buy a popper that has a spinning bottom WITHOUT a fan that blows the kernels up and out of the chute. Total waste of money!"
2,I disagree,"Yes, the popcorn comes out tasty and few kernels are wasted but this Orville Redenbacher Hot Air Corn Popper makes a mess. I spend more time clearing the counter than I do eating the popcorn. There are better products out there."
1,extremely bad product - don't waste your money,"The Orville Redenbacher Hot Air Corn Popper smokes, burns and doesn't work. It didn't work with the old corn I had on hand and it didn't work with the expensive Orville Redencacher brand recommended with the popper. This is the worst product I've ever bought and never use it. Your rating system needs a zero star category - as in don't ever buy this junk!It's too much trouble to return it - it wasn't that expensive - so I'm giving it to a do-it-yourselfer who can use the motor - I think that's the only salvagable part."
3,OK Popper,"Ended up returning this witout using it. Wanted a good popper that I could add oil to while it is cooking. Realized when this arrived that it won't allow for oil to be used while popping the corn, had to be added afterward which leaves me with mushy popcorn & an unhappy family. Ended up popping mine on the stove in coconut oil & we fell in love! No more micro popcorn for us!"
1,Too bad there isn't a 0 star category,"After approximately 12 uses, the popper made a loud popping sound, sent out a little puff of smoke, and that was it. No more hot-air popping in our house. Because it was purchased on-line with no store to go complain to and because we only have popcorn once a week thereby passing the 30 day return policy, we're out of luck. In addition, the popper is so noisy that it's almost a blessing in disguise that it broke so soon. And one last thing, hot-air popcorn tastes dry and stale. Even with butter, I could never get past a few handfuls and then I had enough."
3,Bringing back old memories,"I only rated the Presto Hot Air Popper with 3 stars because it has not yet been used. I remember having one as a kid - you know, the ugly old yellow one that sounds like your whole house is about to take flight? But it made great popcorn and lasted forever.I bought a new one as a gift for my boyfriend who has been wanting an air popper for some time now. It arrived in excellent condition - as it should have - and is a much lighter model than I remember. Hopefully, it will last for years to come!"
2,Older really is better,"The Orville Redenbacher Hot Air Corn Popper we purchased several months ago has consistently been a disappointment. While it pops great corn, it does not have the on/off switch that our 20 year old one has; it hurls kernels everywhere and doesn't pop all of them. AND biggest disappointment of all, it doesn't melt butter in time for the popped corn like our old one did."
2,spews hot unpopped kernels!,"The corn it does pop tastes great. But I'm astounded by the number of positive reviews because I just recieved one of these for Christmas and during my 5 attempts have had 1/3 of my hot unpopped kernels shoot out of the machine - into the bowl if I was lucky, all over the counter if I was not. Perhaps it's because we're popping this fancy gourmet corn we got with the machine, but I say BUYER BEWARE! There has to be a better one out there..."
4,good popper!,"This hot air corn popper works well, pops quickly and evenly.Only drawback is no on/off button, but this is not a huge inconvenience. Good value."
2,Keep Looking,"My chief gripe with this popper is that the popping chamber is very shallow and it seems like half of the popcorn kernels end up getting blown out of the popper before they get a chance to pop. I'm keeping it, but if you're shopping, I'd pass on this one and look for one that has a deeper popping well."
3,About that no switch thing...,"No manufacturer of these things is adding a switch. Would it cost THAT much?Try a Plug-in Cord switch. It's an electric plug with a switch attached to it; when the switch is at the OFF position, an appliance plugged into it gets no power. Move switch to ON, and the juice flows.I searched on Amazon for Plug-In Switch and found this listing today:COOPER WIRING DEVICES INC #BP4404V IVY Plug In Cord SwitchBuy new: $4.19 $3.516 Used & new from $2.99so you can probably order it from Amazon at the same time as your popper, though the price may be different.I don't have a Presto, mine is a 20-30 year old West Bend Popcorn Pumper WITH on/off switch (why I bought that one, so many years ago). It just feels safer to use a switch as opposed to pulling out the plug. But I will most likely buy a Presto (I trust the brand) and get one of these plug-in switches to use with it."
4,needs butter,works great but ejects a few un-popped kernels in the process. you really need some oil or butter for the taste but i knew that going in.
5,works great,"Wonderful product, amazing. It seems to pop a huge bowl of popcorn (from a half cup of un-popped kernels) in about two minutes, and it does such a clean, complete job that there seems to be no need to bother to clean the popper afterwards, though I do quickly with a damp sponge."
5,still a great little machine,"We had one of these years ago and it's wonderful how little space they take up. Works like a charm and usually only a couple old maids. We had succombed to the microwave craze until recent reviews on the downsides of that indulgence and decided to return to the healthier air popped popcorn option. We do use a spray on butter to give it a little boost of flavor with a dash of salt. Still the great product it's always been, ready instantly."
5,Great product,This hot air corn popper is an excellent product. It takes very little time and you have an excellent snack!!!
4,Good air popper,Good air popper. Great for folks on a diet. No problem that it comes without a switch as it is easy to unplug. I would buy this again.
5,Great Popcorn,"This air popper pops delicious popcorn. It is quick, fairly quiet, and the popcorn it makes is so healthy. The kernels are large and fluffy. There are almost no unpopped kernels in the bowl. We add just a small amount of butter and salt. It is so much better tasting than microwave popcorn, and better for you too."
2,Save your money,Although I followed the directions this only lasted a few months and in it's final stages I think the motor was burning up. I probably only made about 20 bowls of popcorn with it.
5,Orville Corn Popper,This corn popper is fast. All the kernels of corn popped. The machine does not turn off when all the kernels have popped so you must stand there and unplug it. You also need a large bowl for the corn and it may be hot to the touch when finished.
2,worked awhile then broke,"Today's poppers don't work like they did 30 years ago. This one did work for about 2 years before breaking, which when it did it caught on fire instantaneously. Also- there is no way to properly melt butter with this one so you need to melt in the microwave or stovetop. The little measuring thing on top will not melt butter unless you want to sit there for 30 minutes waiting."
1,"Off-Gassing Plastic Smell, No on/off Switch, and Unpopped kernels","Unfortunately, I am really disappointed in this product--enough to write this review. I contacted the seller to do a return and we shall see what the outcome is. The most disturbing thing to me is the plastic smell--and the fact that the plastic cover gets hot and undoubtedly off-gasses. For someone with multiple-chemical sensitivities, this is a very real problem. I can deal with the handful of unpopped kernels (which you can just throw back into the shoot if you're quick at it) but the plastic smell is too much. Why don't they make quality products the way they used to in the good ole days? Everything's made so cheaply now. Oh and the lack of on and off switch adds to the fire-hazard of this product."
1,Is it supposed to smoke like that?,"Okay My parents have one of these that's at least 20 years old. My mm bought me this... thing for my birthday. I measure out a serving of popcorn and put it in, and plug it in a normal kitchen outlet. This popper started smoking up the whole kitchen and 5 minutes later I still have NO popcorn. What happened to this once great company? I am even using a new container of Orville's pop corn!I have to say STAY AWAY from this crap! I am not going to buy another thing from Redenbacher cause this it the 3rd (different) popper that didnt work! What trash. Yes, I have tried THREE models!"
1,"Awful, Terrible, Horrible!","I should have listened to the other reviews. This popcorn popper shot the kernels out too fast. They didn't go into the bowl, they went all over the kitchen. I returned it the next day. Don't waste your money or your time buying this one."
1,Junk,We order this thinking it would be better than microwave popcorn. We were wrong. When we took it out of the box we noticed it did not have a power switch. The first time we used it the measure cup on top melted and warped. We decided it wasn't worth possibly burning down house so we returned it.
2,Messy,"Initially a bought a Cook popcorn popper and I love it! It pops the corn quickly and the popcorn lands in the bowl and leaves very few kernels unpopped. I decided to buy an additional popcorn popper and was I disappointed. The Presto hot air popper blows the popcorn and the kernels all over the place and makes a mess. I will be returning this one and replacing it with an additional Cooks hot air popper for my second home. All hot air poppers are not created equal as I found out. Also the Cooks hot air popper is cheaper. In both poppers you can use the cup that is included to measure both the popcorn and the butter which melts as the popcorn is popping...a nice feature. Also with both poppers, all you need to clean after using is the measuring cup, so cleanup is easy."
1,Hot Air,"Last night I purchased the Presot Orville Redenbacher's hot air popper. When I got home and took my new air popper out of the box, read the brief instructions and started my popcorn. Or so I thought I did. Within 15-seconds after I plugged the popper in, the machine just started blow the popcorn kernels out into the bowl. No popcorn, yet all of the uncooked kernels were in the bowl. Next I ran the machine for about a minute to warm it up. I placed another 1/4 cup of kernels in the popper. Again, all it did was blow the kernels into the bowl without popping. I have to say this for the Orville Redenbacher's hot air popper, it was just like the advertisements that I have seen - a bunch of HOT AIR!"
1,This is the biggest piece of crap kitchen appliance ever.,"Pros:1.simple design of only 3 parts.2. Smaller footprint when compared with similar models.Cons:1. Bad design. I Stuck a bowl in front and turn this thing on. It was almost comical to see 1 out of every 3 kernels blown on the floor, or at least not in the bowl. Popcorn should flow out of the machine like a waterfall into the bowl. This machine blows popcorn like a rogue hairdryer.2. Burnt up after 2 years and less then 10 uses (bowls of popcorn). Kinda a deal breaker, no? I almost feel bad for the late Orville Redenbacher, for having his name defiled with this piece of kitchen appliance."
1,Sucks.,"I only made one batch of popcorn and then it died.Unluckily, the return window had expired. This product is far too fragile"
3,Wild Thing!,"Man does it POP popcorn..all over the place! I keep a brown bag close by the shute BEFORE PLUGGING THE CORD IN THE AC SOCKET. No Off/On switch as some have mentioned here. The Lid Cover is both the measuring cup and to melt butter. The Lid Cover over time seems to become loser, thus pops off allowing kernels to shoot out all over the place. It does pop most all the popcorn & fluffy too. After all this, I think I will look for some other popcorn gadget, meanwhile back to the mini microwave popcorn bags. *SIGHS*"
1,Made a mess!,"Got one for Christmas. Every time we used it, it blew very hot unpopped kernels out of the tube along with the popped corn. Those burn when they hit skin!!! This continued throughout the cycle, as we dodged both popped and unpopped corn that flew out of the tube. Yes, we had it completely assembled with a bowl underneath the chute!! When the popping was done, over half the corn had not popped and was either in the bottom of the bowl, on the counter, or on the floor. We took it back."
1,Sold as new however repackaged and obviously used,This was bought from Amazon as a new item however the box was resealed and obviously used with a burnt kernel inside. I don't appreciate paying for a new item to get someone's used returned item that is possibly damaged or a fire risk. UNHAPPY Amazon!
1,5 uses? Really??? 4 uses on the second one....,I bought this thing at the end of January and used it a total of 5 times. I started it up and in about 15 seconds there was a huge cloud of smoke and the motor died. I am deeply disappointed in this product and saddened to see that here are not many alternatives to this unit available.zWell I paid for a repair on the first one I bought and it was almost as much as a new one. I have used the replacement 4 times and it just burned out like the other one. Do NOT buy this garbage. I am going back to old fashioned kettles.
4,Great value!,"This popcorn popper is a great buy. It is easy to use, a snap to clean, and it pops almost every single kernel, every time. Its only downfall is not having an on/off switch; you have to plug/unplug it from the wall outlet."
4,Fairly decent,I bought this because my other hot air popper left unpopped kernels. I was told that this machine popped all the kernels. Not so. Still a few unpopped. Does pop the corn really fast - hardly enough time for the butter to melt.
5,The Easiest Way I've Found To Make Delicious Popcorn!,You put in 1/4-cup popcorn. You cover the top so it doesn't pop out. You put a large bowl under it. You plug it in. You wait until it stops popping and you have popcorn!This is so easy and it can be healthy to make your own popcorn rather than buy packages with unhealthy ingredients. YOU get to decide if you want salt or butter or other spices on it.Excellent product. I recommend it for its simplicity and because it works well.
3,Alright - not great,"The up side is this popper pops fast. Real fast. So if your primary goal is great popcorn in the span of a commercial break, I say go for it. And you certainly can't beat Amazon's price shopping elsewhere (yup, I tried).The down side is the top doesn't stay on very well when moving it, so when you put it in the cabinet, for instance, be prepared to reattatch the top regularly. The wide mouth and low lip also means it likes to spit out kernels that pop on the counter, so be prepared to do some cleaning up, too.Finally, as noted by many others, there is no on/off switch. Doesn't bother me, but I know it will other people.Sadly, I looked pretty much everywhere for a better hot-air popper, and there just doesn't seem to be one. Until there is, you may be best to just accept this designs flaws, relish its low price-point, and enjoy some heart-healthy popcorn."
2,Good for standard yellow popcorn--not other varieties,"I've had this popcorn popper for years--I would estimate 10 years. If you're only planning to use it for standard yellow kernels, it does a good job.If you try popping any other variety of popcorn, a few things could happen. Either the popper won't force the popped kernels out quickly enough, and the popcorn will burn inside the unit.Or the kernels will be too light and get ejected from the popper before they've had time to heat properly.I've never had luck with any other popcorn other than standard yellow kernels with this popper.If you plan to melt butter using the removable butter melter at the top, make sure that the butter has thawed for a couple of hours first. Otherwise, it's not going to melt while the popcorn is popping. Cutting it up into smaller chunks also helps.Also, the ""18 cups"" referred to in the description is 18 cups, popped. The unit warns you not to use more than 1/2 cup of unpopped kernels at a time."
4,Popcorn fast and fat free,I purchased this popper so I could have fat-free popcorn. The machine works good and most of the corn pops. Healthier method to make popcorn.
1,Don't Buy,"Stopped working after second use. Pop and smoke! Scary considering there is no on/off switch and you have to pull the plug. Parents have had one for years, should have read other reviews. Quality and safety in this world has really suffered to keep pricing down."
4,The wife liked it!,"Personally, I cannot stand air-popped popcorn as its like eating styrofoam chips. But, it was not for me, it was for my wife who likes eating styrofoam chips, why, I don't know! It performs quickly, pops 99% of the kernels, and they pop very large too. It has no off/on switch, so plug it into a power strip with a switch if you don't want to plug and unplug. It has a butter melter tray on top; but that defeats the purpose of air-popping to avoid excessive calories. In addition, on other brands that I have owned, not this one as I am under orders not to contaminate it with butter...the butter melters stop up anyway just like your arteries would, I suppose. But, for old, hard headed me, my popcorn eating days are over. If I can't have the greasy skillet variety, I don't want any stryofoam chips. But healthy chewing to all who like this, and the popper itself is great, except for the switch business."
1,Unpopped Kernels Everywhere,This thing is horrible! Half of the kernels were pushed out unpopped by the popped kernels. Both flew out with enough force that about 10% of them were missing the bowl (one large enough that it shouldn't be a problem) and flying all over the kitchen. Just what I need when making popcorn with my toddler... burning hot bullets flying through the air. I'm guessing that it's due to the poor lid/chute design coupled with a fan blowing everything up. Just look at the vertical space at the opening between the bottom of the chute and the top where things can fly horizontally without hitting part of the lid and being forced down.Oh yeah... and no on/off switch. Plugging it in turns it on and you have to pull the plug to turn it off. I'd pay another dollar to have a switch. Sheesh.Returning it to the department store where I bought it and searching Amazon for a new one that works.
4,Love it!,Works great! I always grew up with a hot-air popcorn popper. One suggestion is to let it run/warm-up for about a minute before you drop the kernels in...helps with the popping. Enjoy!
3,Dented and Wobbly,"Popper arrived on time and works fine but it's dented on the bottom and wobbly. I didn't want to go through the hassle/expense of exchanging it. It is only a popcorn popper that is stored in a cabinet when not in use but when I take it out, it bugs me."
4,Fun,"Met my expectations, fast devliery. Watch out for a few unpopped kernels shooting out at the start, but otherwise make tasty air-popped corn fast and easy."
4,Pop it!,I think its a little pricy but the machine works very good and I get healthy pop corn anytime I want.
1,Very Disappointed,"I owned a popcorn popper back in the 80s and dearly loved it and it wasn't made of cheap plastic like this one. And, it had an on / off switch which this one does not and I do not like having to plug and unplug it every time I use it. I have very large bowls for the popcorn to go in but this thing spews the kernels and popcorn everywhere, plus I lose a lot of popcorn because the shaft it not long enough to handle it while the hot air blows around. Very disappointed in this thing and will give it to someone else. I thought since it had the Redenbacher name, it would be good... boy was I WRONG !!"
1,Miserable popcorn popper,"We saw the good reviews of this popper and bought one. After one use, we packed it back up and returned it. Unpopped kernels flew out of the popper onto the floor as soon as we turned it on. There were many unpopped kernels when we were done. We tried to melt butter in the butter melter but it didn't melt - not hot enough. We had to melt the butter in the microwave. The popcorn wasn't even very hot when we ate it. We bought an air popper many years ago at Penney's that we were seeking to replace, but it's so dramatically better than this one, we'll just keep using it."
4,Yep,"We use this as 1 - 3 year olds are welcomed to class, they seem to like it, it is really easy and it provides a lot less separation anxiety."
1,Makes Tough popcorn,I bought this knowing that I had a wal mart brand but it didn't pop all the kernels. So we thought this orville popper would be better and it cost almost twice as much. The popcorn is almost uneatable as it is so tough. Called Customer service and they said it will be tougher. I told them the cheap version at wal mart wasn't. It was nice and crispy. That was it no return no anything.
3,"OK, but not Great.","I bought one of these at my local hardware store for only $10.The problem is, It has no on/off button. You plug it in to turn it on, and Unplug it to turn it off.I thought that was very stupid construction. You can easily cause fires or Blow Fuses in your breaker box by doing that.Also, the design itself is knida shotty, because on AVERAGE, 10% of the kernels that you pour into it to get popped, end up being blown out by the hot-air fan, into the popcorn bowl, BEFORE they've popped.I'm glad I now have a popper to make my own popcorn, but I would go with a closed design for my next one.(one of those ones with the popcorn bowl built INTO it, on the top, so you just flip it over when done popping)"
4,"First one failed, but second is running strong","The first popper I got went a little spastic and didn't end up working out. It ran great for about 4 or so batches and then would not run correctly (went on and off sporadically when plugged in). I issued a return and got a new one nearly the next day, so returns are very easy. After only paying about 19 dollars for this, I didn't expect it to be a super machine, so I wasn't alarmed about the issue. I have my second one now and I'm popping away. It pops a whole batch and leaves almost no kernels at all. Great machine, I am happy with my purchase."
1,My Air Popper shipped w/ top cracked,"This is my second Hot air popper. Although I love the idea of this product, the top for it cracks quite easily. My first one cracked after dropping to the floor, (my fault) but I just bought the newer version of it on Amazon and when it arrived the cover had a slight crack in it. Also the butter melting attachment is small and can be easily misplaced or even broken. Over all I wouldn't recommend this product."
3,No on/off switch but works great,"We wanted this to help save $ on snack foods - hoping our older kids could use it independently (they are 6 and 8 yrs). There is no on/off switch as pictured - power goes on as you plug it in, so not safe for our kids to use without help. Otherwise, pops almost all kernels, melts butter, works great."
1,crappy,Smaller capacity then stated in product description. They don't make them like they used to definitely applies to air popcorn poppers. You can't roast coffee in this popper. If your popping corn or roasting coffee Irecommend you get a West Bend Poppery off ebay will prolly be cheaper and deffinitly work better.
1,Very disappointing,"They don't make these like they used to. Cheap flimsy materials.The butter doesn't melt, and the popcorn isn't hot. No on/off switch??Are things that bad they can't have one?? Seems like a hazard! I am returningand returning to microwave popcorn!"
4,Does a great job.,"Pops a large quantity without wasting hardly any kernels. It is missing one thing to make it 5 stars, an on / off switch."
4,"Fast, easy and perfect low cal snack","After reading about all the harmful chemicals that possibly end up in microwave bagged popcorn, I decided to look into a hot air popcorn popper. I use this machine at least 3 times a week. I really like it other than it is a little loud and blows popcorn dust on counters and floors and I wish it had an on/off switch other than unplugging it from the wall. I have a GFI protected outlet so I don't feel too uncomfortable with this issue. It makes great popcorn and pops most of the kernels. It makes the perfect low cal, low fat, high fiber snack with minimal effort and preparation and easy clean up.skt"
1,Terrible Popper - almost started a fire,"From the beginning this popper makes chewy popped corn - very different than microwaved popcorn. We thought at first that it was the quality of the popping corn we used - as it turned out the cheaper the corn the less chewy the result. The worst results were using Orville's own gourmet popping corn. After a few months of use, this popper stopped blowing, but the heating coil kept going - so the popper started smoking. A terrible design when you think about it - why would the heating coil run when the fan was not? Tonight the popper blew out the circuit in the wall in which it was plugged - and after it cooled down we tossed it in the trash. Do not get this popper - its a poor design."
3,Presto popcorn popper,"Everything works OK with this popcorn popper except it doesn't have an ""on-off"" switch. You turn it on by plugging it in and turn it off by unplugging it. Each time, sparks fly out of the outlet. I'm surprised that there is no on-off switch on this electrical appliance."
4,Great for the kids,"This popper is great. It isn't perfect, but the best air popper I've owned out of three. It does get very hot, so keep it away from children. Very few unpopped kernels, but the last few unlucky kernels do fly out of the popper, so make sure your bowl is good and deep for catching the popcorn. Recommend to anyone."
5,Great Product,"This Presto machine pops quick and most kernals.They have a cheaper Presto that is Yellow, but stay away from that one. It takes for ever to pop.This is the same one I used in college 20 years ago, and that's how long it latest."
4,Hop on Pop,"Like everyone else, my only criticism is no off switch. Knew in advance this feature was lacking. My whole family enjoys this popper and appreciate the healthier option to popping in oil or in a microwave. Pops just as quickly as a microwave and yields a lot more popped product than the typical bag of microwave popcorn."
1,piece of high price junk,have had the popper about a yr and a half and use it about ten to fifteen times.The motor burned up!!!Built in obsolescence i am sure.
1,"No, I am not going to measure kernels with a calipers","I put in the kernels and the thing just blew them right out. To get it to actually pop corn, I had to hold it tilted backwards at a 45-degree angle. And I was still having to pick up hot, unpopped kernels and throw them back in. ""Fewer unpopped kernels,"" HA! Somewhere in the instructions it says you can't use small kernels. Maybe this is how they get customers to buy the (larger kernel) Orville Redenbacher brand.The thing has no power switch - instead, you have to plug it/unplug it. That in itself is enough of a pain in the patootie to dump the thing.Don't buy this annoyance."
1,presto corn popper - orville redenbacher model,"Purchased for a Christmas gift, used twice and shorted out internally. Very dis-satisfied with this Presto product. I've never had a product go bad this soon after purchasing."
5,Get a big bowl,"This popcorn popper works great, it takes a bit of a start-up time to get going, but once it starts, watch out. And get a big bowl and be ready to rotate it. Personally for me, I am having trouble finding a good balance between the popcorn being too dry, or drowning in liquid butter. I prefer popping on the stove using a little bit of oil and salt, but the clean up for that is much more annoying. If I think of anything better, I'll update."
4,Good,"Bought this item used. Was a little worried because the box was damaged, but it was fine. Works good! Good purchase."
5,Works as expected,I use this a lot now. It works as expected. I do have a few unpopped kernels but nothing more than I would expect. Its easy to clean since there's no oil and I don't use butter. A quick wipe and I put it away.
4,Good product,"The product is simple and works well. The clear plastic top is a bit cheap feeling, I am concerned it may crack if dropped...but for the cost is a good product."
3,Hot Popper,"The product works great and I love it, but it came damaged on the bottom. The bottom plate was slightly bent and I have to put something under it to level it before I use it."
4,glad I bought it,"this is my first popcorn popper and yes I went by the reviews. I love it. no oils , no mess( I don't use the butter warmer ). it can spit out the occasional kernal ( I usually toss them back in ) and the end of a popping cycle can get chaotic but I'm very happy with it.it pops almost all the kernals ( more so that shaking a pan or microwave bags.) and isn't laden with fats making it lighter."
4,Are you on a DIET?,I love airpoppers. I bought the popper because I am on a diet and want something healthy to eat as a snack. I never use the butter melter. The popper works fine. Questions to the manufacturer: 1) why put a butter melter in that is constantly falling out for people who are on diets? 2) Where is the on/off switch? 3) Why is the machine so big and unwieldy? 4) Why is the mouth so short that popcorn flys all over? Why not make it longer to point into a bowl?
1,this is a waste of money,"I will have to return this one. It was such a disappointment. Kernals went flying out of the shoot as soon as I plugged it in, and there was plenty more that didn't get popped. The butter never melted. Maybe it was a defect, but I'm not taking a chance."
2,Does worse than the stove...,"I got this for Christmas from my Mother-In-Law. I usually make popcorn on the stove with canola oil and melted butter. I have tried this several times but the result doesn't taste as good (dry, stale flavor even with butter), there are much higher un-popped kernels (I usually average 0 on the stove - this gives me about 8), the butter doesn't actually finish melting before the popcorn is done so it requires running it longer or melting the butter on the stove, if I were to try using chilled butter there would be no hope, thus depleting my stock of room temp. butter. So this isn't easier and it isn't better and it isn't cleaner so just do it on the stove it isn't even hard."
1,Cheap and Dangerous,"We've had this for about a year and today it burned out, spewing blue smoke and a horrible electrical smell as soon as we turned it on. Cheap and dangerous!"
4,An oldie but a goodie!,"In the age of microwave popcorn, it is really great to enjoy a bowl of hot air popped popcorn. It tastes better, makes more (and more economical), and you can season the corn any way you want to!! This machine pops EVERY kernel! It's fast, easy to clean, and after 10 years of fairly regular popping--STILL WORKS!!I have used the butter chamber a few times, but with the amount of butter I need for the amount of popcorn I make at one time, it doesn't thoroughly melt by the time I am through popping."
1,I Bought A Better Popper Than This and you can Microwave the Kernels.,"I received the Presto Popper as an gift. After a couple times of dodging the bullets of the popping kernels. I went out and search the Internet for a Microwaveable Popcorn Popper.I found it on Linen N Things web site - I'm sure if there is an Linen N Things store near you can purchase it there. Priced at $ 12.99 the name of the popper is called ""Miracle Wave Progressive Popcorn Popper"" in the store.On the internet the name of the Popper is called ""Progressive Popcorn Popper"" - the item number 1868681.Its completely dishwasher safe and meant for the microwave. it has a covered dome container and when it pops its not spraying you with the unpopped kernels.I've been happy ever since....just wanted everyone to know there is an alternative out there."
4,Presto Hot Air Popper,The popper works as expected. I really prefer this method to microwave popping! Butter doesn't warm up as well as I'd hoped in cup - you may need to warm butter up another way. Other than that - works great!
2,I had a better hot air machine 25 years ago,"This machine blows hard directly out of the popping chamber, meaning it will leave very little mess behind. 10-20 kernels always fly out before it even begins popping. And once it starts popping, some very hot kernels fly out, only to pop inside the popcorn bowl, throwing popcorn all over the place. The plastic gets hot enough to become noticeably soft.My old machine blew sideways, creating a vortex inside that did not allow unpopped kernels to escape. The only drawback was having to pour the remaining contents out of the machine after it was done popping, but that's nowhere near as bad as having to pick up popcorn off the floor like you have to do with this device."
2,Great if you like hot kernels flying everywhere,"I ordered this product to be able to make popcorn without the oil, and it does accomplish that task. However, as the kernels heat up, they start to fly out the chute before they have popped, resulting in hot kernels everywhere. They are so hot, in fact, that if you try to catch them or pick them up, you will get burned. If you tilt the machine way back while it is heating, this isn't so much of a problem, but it is far from ideal. So, it pops popcorn without oil, but it makes a mess of hot kernels around the kitchen."
4,Simply amazing and easy to use,"I recently bought this awesome popper and it works great, both for the price(got mine for $15 from amazon) and performance. It does pop within 2-3 minutes and leave very few unpopped kernels. I am a college student and I know what it takes to clean-up...but hey great news...this is very easy to clean...I just wipe it with a paper napkin and its as good as new.I took one star off because it doesn't have a on/off switch. But otherwise go for it."
3,Hot Air Popper,No off/on switchVery violent. Have to sweep floor after popping.Kernals blow out of popper before popping.Very fast and the popcorn is good.
4,Great product!,"I wanted a popper that would not burn the kernals and my microwave ones were leaving me dissatisfied with unpopped kernals and burned ones. This one works great and with the exception of being overzealous at times and throwing out a few unpopped kernals, works very well. I am going to order another one for family members."
4,Exactly what I expected.,"I bought this popper because I wanted to quit buying microwave popcorn due to trying to be more ""green"" and more healthy. I admit that I gave up a lot of flavor because hot air popcorn isn't very good, but it was exactly what I expected. The popper is loud but it's also very fast and efficient. The price was great, too."
3,Good popper,"This is the healthy way to eat popcorn, using only air. There are virtually no calories or cholesterol with this method of popping popcorn. Unfortunately, the popper design is basically unchanged from the seventies. First, the popper constantly rotates and moves on my kitchen counter; it must be held in place for the entire popping cycle. Also, some popcorn still pops in the bowl instead of the popper, creating a huge mess. In addition, there is still no on/off switch; turning the popper off can be a challenge with a hot cord which I encounter after popping a bowl of popcorn. You've had thirty years to improve on the hot air popcorn popper, and you've wasted them."
4,Not for you if you like to microwave a popcorn and grease brick.,"Other reviews have covered everything. The incredibly light, fluffy popcorn (perfect with a little bit of butter and salt, I think,) the stray kernel or two which get launched across the room, the fact that your popcorn bowl will overflow.Two things that work for me: I tip the popper back a bit when I first plug it in, and when it gets going I guide the popcorn into the bowl with a clean dish towel.One batch is perfect for two people and a movie. If you've got more faces to feed you can make several batches in a row. (Have lots of bowls handy.)Very quick, very easy. If it had an on/off switch I might have to give it six stars."
5,Great Machine,"Bought and returned two other ""makes"" for unsatisfactory results. This machine works great. Few kernels are left. The other makes either threw the unpopped kernels out along with the popcorn or shut off before getting hot enough to complete the operation. The only problem I have with this machine is that it is not available for sale from a distributor in Canada, even from retail outlets that operate in both the US and Canada. The US outlets, Walmart and Target, carry the brand but the Canadian outlets do not."
4,Popper Review,"This hot air popper works great, and I especially like the fact that I can use it to make popcorn without the need for added oil or butter. I bought this back in 2009 and have used it probably about 50 times since then. It still works to this day.The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because the popper (probably like most) will shoot unpopped corn kernels out into the bowl (less than 1% of the total amount of corn put in). This is a minor thing, but I would have preferred to have a popper that keeps all kernels inside until they are popped."
4,As expected,"I've only used it once, but was very pleased with the performance and the quality of popcorn it produced"
5,The Best Koyunbaba!,"Wow!, Ms. Afshar's interpretation of Domeniconi's Koyunbaba is simply wonderful! There is more expression, more emotion, more ""Easternness"" to her version than to that of Antigoni Goni, or of John Williams (on ""The Guitarist""). You haven't really heard Koyunbaba until you've heard this one.Ms. Afshar's five Persian ballads are evocative, and only available on this CD. As a plus for guitarists, Mel Bay has issued the score of all five.This CD is music to be enjoyed!"
2,"Potentially good, but arrived damaged","This shelf has a good solid weight, unlike many others of this type. It is solid wood with an easily used mounting system. The finish is not actual wood, but looks realistic. Unfortunately, even though it came shrink-wrapped all corners were chipped, exposing the light wood underneath which made the damage very obvious. Because I like the basic look of the shelf I'm going to keep it and mount it in a spare bedroom after I darken the corners, but it's not something I would put in my living room where I would see it all the time."
1,BEWARE -- NO RETURN ON THIS ITEM !!,"I ordered this item as a gift and later learned that they had already received a like product. When I tried to return this unused item I was unable to get any response despite the fact that I followed all of the instructions for returns. This item is drop-shipped by wholesalersclub.com. After four phone calls and three emails, I have gotten no repsonse. No only am I upset with wholesalers.com, but with Amazon for subscribing to this kind of lousy service."
2,Tears follow excitement,"This garden becomes beautiful overnight. However, the first time someone walks past the table where it is placed, it falls apart! We thought someone had accidentaly crashed into my daughter's first magic garden so we bought her a replacement - same story. This item is so fragile it is bound to dissappoint."
4,"It is magical, but fragile","I bought this for myself to put in my office and it was great! It's very easy to put together, but as mentioned, it's fragile and can easily fall over. Because mine is in an office, no one bothered it and it lasted for months. Everyone kept coming by to see if it had grown more. I wouldn't recommend it for children because it takes steady hands to make the trees stand up."
2,flimsy,"It's neat and pretty, but a constant source of frusteration because the card board trees and other card board land scape figures keep falling over. Once they fall over, the whole thing is ruined. Maybe if somebody glued them up it would work. My daughter loved it while it lasted. (Less then a week.)"
4,Worked great!,"""It was a bit difficult to put together for my son and one of the packets of solution leaked inside of the box a bit but other than that it worked great. It grew nicely and looked very pretty and my son loved to watch it grow."""
5,Interested in Hebrew Poetry? Check here!,"This is a very good book on Hebrew Poetry. It takes into consideration some of the more current thoughts in linguistics. If you are interested in Hebrew Poetry, you should have this book in your library."
3,Some very good songs and some wrong ones.....,"This is a cd Roger Daltrey did after THE WHO ""broke up in 1983"" and the title track refers to it: Parting should be painless""..It contains some great songs such as ""How does the cold wind cry"" where Roger sings his heart out and also a ballad like ""Would a stranger do?"". He tried to promote ""Walking in my sleep"" as a single with a video. ""Going Strong"" is also a very good song. In the rest of the songs he does not sound confortable, so it seems somebody did some wrong choices.It is clear that the excelent songs here are: ""How does the cold wind cry"", ""Going Strong"", ""Would a Stranger do"" and also good are the title track and ""Walking in my sleep"". The rest...we can forget about them."
5,Presto PowerCups,The product was exactly as advertised and was sent quickly. Will order from this person again when I need this item.
1,Grossly Overpriced,"I purchased the Presto PowerCup Concentrators for my Microwave Popper because I can no longer find them at the store. Since I saw that Amazon carried the and I had an account with them, I bought what I thought was a multi-pack becasue of the price. When the product arrived, I was a amazed to discover that what I thought was two orf three packs was only one.I returned the product and got them at the manufacturer, where I was charged a third of Amazon's price.Buyer Beware"
1,A popcorn addict's nightmare,"I was given a Presto popcorn maker that you use in the microwave. Since it's easier than stove-top popcorn, and less greasy than microwave popcorn, I do like the output. But why, why do we have to keep buying these paper cups? Surely they could have made reusable plastic ones? This is an example of a throwaway society run amok. My advice is, steer clear of these things."
5,presto 09964 power cup a bargin on amazon,"We bought the popcorn popper for this product at Wal-mart, but walmart NEVER seems to have the cups in stock when I need them. They always have them on amazon and their cheaper than walmart."
5,Longtime user,"I've been using this great product for 6 years. The concentrator is meant to be used several times. Use it without oil for longer life and less calories. If your concentrator burns and cracks, turn the power level on your microwave to 90%, and pull it out as soon as the popping stops. The concentrator should last 5-6 batches this way."
1,Work great but priced too high,I love this popper. I've had it for several years. The Amazon price for the concentrators is way too high. You can order them directly from Presto for $1.58 plus $1 s/h.
4,Power Cups,"The Presto Popcorn maker states you must use the PowerCup Concentrators. I made a lot of mistakes my first couple of weeks using this unit which destroyed the PowerCups very quickly. I found to get the longevity they say you can, I let the PowerCups cool down after use and then I take a dry cloth and wipe out and I'm done. Rinsing with water seems to make them breakdown faster and the biggest thing is to really watch your popping time. As soon as the popping slows down take out of the microwave. If you burn your popcorn you are also scorching the PowerCups which will also brakdown fast."
4,1st ones years ago were better,"The first few 'floor mats' I got for my Presto Popper bowl when they first came out were VERY durable ... 1 got 25 to 30 batches out of each one. After about the first year, the durability declined sharply, and I now only get about 10 batches before the plastic film surface begins breaking up and flaking off. It is still the most convenient and my favorite method of popping a very generous portion of popcorn. One Caveat: the Power Pop is NOT for 'neat freeks' ... it is very hard to clean thoroughly, but I don't bother. I just keep it tucked up on an out of the way shelf."
5,"Works great, but can be pricey.....","These fit the bill fine, but when you like your popcorn with oil (recommended to use 1 - 2 TBS), they really only do two or three batches before needing replaced. We use refined coconut oil and the taste is great, but 8 PowerCups will do well to last through 16 - 24 batches."
5,presto disks,"This presto popcorn popper makes the BEST popcorn ever. Even though you have to buy replacement disks, it's still cheaper and better than buying prepackaged microwave popcorn with all of it's added salt, shortening and preservatives.1/3 C popcorn1/2 tbsp oilThat's it!!I use Butter flavor Pam spray and a little salt. Delicious!!!"
5,Presto Popcorn concentrator filters,I am so grateful to have found the product still available. It makes all the difference in getting all the popcorn kernels to pop. And it was sent in a timely fashion. Great work to all who were involved. And thanks again.
1,Power Pop and PowerCup concentrators,"The PowerPop popper and the PowerCup concentrators were a solid disappointment. I followed the instructions to the letter and the corn did not pop well, there were many burned kernels and the concentrator melted the bottom of the PowerPop.I have used the popper twice and will probably never attempt to use it again."
5,Pass The Popcorn,"The Presto Microwave Corn Popper is a great item. These power cups keep the popping time to a minimum and assure the fewest ""old maids."""
4,power cup concentrators for presto popcorn popper,I like these but there were a lot of kernels that didn't get popped in the microwave. They tend to curl up after the first use.
5,"fast,easy sale","very fast, product is needed to use other product. Would haveloved more, but ridiculous to pay two vendors shippingto get enough. Next time I look for one vendor to give theamount I want at a good price.Please do not ask anything more and no solicitation!!!!"
5,POPCORN,"I DON'T KNOW WHY THE STORES AROUND THE DALLAS AREA HAVE QUITE SELLING THIS PRODUCT, BUT IT WAS A BIG MISTAKE, NOW I TAKE CARE OF IT ONLINE. SAVES TRIPS TO THE STORE, AND MONEY."
2,PIA,Annoying to use til you get the hang of it. VERY sensitive to timing (burns)and additives (salt).
5,Worked great for me.,"This product worked great for the Cingular 8525. All you need to do is make sure you have a USB chord...Then it's all good. I am actually searching the net for an adapter like this for my cell, too."
1,Does not work for Cingular 8525,Does not charge the Cingular (ATT) 8525 phone. The only thing that is works with to charge my H700 bluetooth headset.
5,worth every cent,We bought this for our son (age 7) for Christmas. He enjoys real life hunting and fishing and loves this game.
5,cabela's outdoor adventure 2006,I purchased this game for my 10 yr old son as a birthday gift.He really enjoyed it and it was not as difficult for him to operate. The game is challanging and has alot of different options the use in creating your own specific hunts!!!! I rate this game an A+..
5,AWSOME!!!,I love the game. It is really fun. Although it is easy on greenhorn mode (that is easy mode) it is fun on sportsman and simulation. I love it. It is worth every penny your heart will race as you get farther in the game.
5,Cabela's Outdoor Adventures PC,"Length:: 2:40 MinsThis video is actual footage from the PC version of the game. It's not me playing it,but I know that when I look 4 games on here-it'd be nice to see what it looks like! I bought this game 4 my PS 2,& it's AMAZING! Just wish I could get it 4 my X-BOX 360."
3,"Nice, but...",This is a nice game but it is not as good as the others. For one thing all huting games r hard but this one is the hardest one i have played. It is hard to find the game because it does not have the dots showing where they r. U can drive allot of different vechiles in this game and there r many different places to go. It is very realistic like other hunting games but the fishing is hard and not worth doing. I like all of the other hunting games better than this one. U can get hurt very easy in this one also. It is a great game with great graphics but it is very hard. I would not buy this game just for the fishing.
4,fun and challenging,very fun game it takes a little while to learn how to play there are lots of buttons to use at one time.
3,"It lacks alot, but still has a little room for fun!","This game really does lack! I wanted the game for the fishing. It turned out that it was the worst, most unrealistic fishing expeirience I've ever had! This came, although lacks in it's fishing feature, has a nice hunting feature! There are no red dot's to indicate where the animals are, so it's just a little more realistic than the recent cabelas Games! But to replace the red dot's you have a radar that has different color dots. The different colors indicate what your animal is: Pink= small game, yellow= deer, and green= large game! But there is one more thing about the fishing: you have to get beside a fishing sign to be able to fish! This game is something I would only rent, nothing else. So please, do me a favor, and play it before you buy it!"
4,Pretty Fair,"This product was pretty good. The tights were of good quality, which I like since it is less likely to tear."
2,Won't stay on your feet,"Like so many other reviewers, I'm disappointed in the way these shoes slip off my feet. Something about them is also really uncomfortable, and I have other high strappy sandals that don't have this problem. I wear them sometimes because they are cute, then I end up regretting it because my feet hurt and they slip off. My advice - keep looking..."
2,I returned these shoes!,I loved the look of the shoes- but the heels are high and the straps hardly keep them on your feet. I am usually good at walking in heels but felt very unsteady in these.
4,so cute!,"Love them. Could have potential for a little pinching on the inside of the foot where the strap is, but I got them for like $21 when they were on sale (I think they're now $50), therefore, I am totally willing to experiment with some padding in that spot if it proves to be a problem. Also, I commonly have trouble with my heel slipping out of slingbacks, but these are adjustable, and no problem. They look great on -- very classic."
3,"so cute, but.....",They are pretty comfortable and look cute with everything but the straps just won't stay on. I ordered a half size smaller than normal and have the straps tightened as much as they will go and the back strap still falls off.
4,Sexy Sandals Girl,I have these in black - they are sexy and I find them comfortable enough that I have traveled in them a few times with no problems. What a great summer sandal to dress up (or sex-up) an outfit. I wear them to work and to dinner and they work both places. I have a small foot (5 or 5 1/2) and these accentuated my feet perfectly. I think they would work for any foot size - especially larger feet with a beautiful pediucre to show off!
2,yikes,"I ordered these shoes for a wedding, but I had to return them. I tried them on for about 3 seconds and my feet were hurting. Since the heel is pretty high, you foot slides forward and there is not much shoe to hold your foot in place. This one strap right across my toes was bascially squeezing my foot into the shoe and it hurt!"
1,I wish they were as practical as they are cute!,"First, let me say that I LOVE Nine West shoes. It's practically all I own. So when I bought these, I was very excited to wear them out on the town.....unfortunately, I didn't even make it out of the house. Because they are SO adorable, I tried everything to get them to stay on my feet: rubber straps, tape, etc. Nothing worked. Bottom line- these shoes are not wearable."
3,Looks great but not the best for comfort,"These shoes looked great and went perfectly with a bridesmaid dress I wore. However, they did not feel great after a day of standing and dancing-- they hurt!"
3,Cute but can be painful,The shoes are very cute but I agree that the strap on the back of the foot slips down constantly. It adds more pressure on the front of your foot where the strap hits. I love the shoes but when I took them off boy did my feet ache.
2,Gorgeous if they'd stay on,"I have these in black. They are one of the sexiest pairs of shoes I own. I truly feel beautiful when wearing them. One problem though, they won't stay on the backs of my ankles! They slip right off with every step. So even though I bought them for a wedding, I couldn't actually wear them there or anywhere else either.I was very disappointed because I am a Ninewest fanatic. I have so many pairs and they all fit wonderfully. This has been the only exception."
4,"Really cute and versatile, less than comfy.","I bought these shoes in black to wear for Easter and other upcoming events. I was pleased when I received them, they are cute with a high heel, but don't look trashy. I didn't have any problem with the strap slipping off the back (they are adjustable). The problem I had was that the strap across the toe is pretty thin and it put a lot of pressure on my toes, making them uncomfortable after three hours. If you aren't going to be standing for long periods (like in a wedding) I would reccommend them, they are really all purpose sandals."
2,cute sandals but painful,these heels are adorable. i bought them for a wedding and after a while my feet were hurting so bad. would not recommend.
2,Uncomfortable For Wide Feet,"I wear 8.5 - 9, usually 8.5 in sandals like these. I have wide feet and if you do as well I would NOT recommend these. I love Nine West but these heels can be worn for about 10 minutes before you're ready to go bare foot."
4,Nice shoes,"This shoe is nice,it have a great height and very comfortable to walk in.But like all other reviews just the strap keeps falling of at times."
1,Leaked,I purchased this cooler and used it once. If you tilted it to the side water would coming pouring out.
1,No way,"Have used it a several times with no problem with the zipper, but doesn't hold shape and the water leaks out of it. If you use maybe the fozen ice packs and don't put ice in it, it would be okay for some stuff but much better coolers out there on the market. Don't waste your money on this one."
2,Not so good,"The zipper broke after only 3 uses and althought the item has legs in the front to hold it up...the item collapses when you stand it up, it will not sit upon all fours (per say) not happy with the purchase at all."
3,"sometimes luck can fool you, or I got what I paid for...","I won this unit as a door prize and I have gotten some good use out of it despite it's ""cons"". The zipper does stick if dirty, and it can leak and is a bit of a pain to clean out. The wheels are small and so walking with it is not very easy as it can wobble when fully loaded, which I tend to overdo (This unit holds A LOT of stuff).I recommend this item to anyone who can get it for free. Otherwise, invest in a more robust, readily steered, more easily cleaned unit. Must test the zipper or closer mechanisms as they get the most wear and try the wheels over a hard tiled (hotel-like) floor as it tends to ""buck n' wobble"".BTW/ The soft sided units do fold away nicely for storage, but must be cleaned and DRY before storage or you'll get mildew/mold/stains and odor the next time you use it.We hope to win a HARDSIDED unit with wheels ...maybe NEXT time)...z"
2,At least it's pretty.,"I have had this wok for some time now but I just don't love it. What I find is that, being cast iron, this pan really only heats up on the part of the surface that is immediately on top of the base. The heat does not spread well. It's essentially a 14"" wok that has a 6"" cooking surface. Really disappointing. Food takes forever to cook.In general I absolutely love cast iron. But this wok is not great, and especially not considering the price."
4,Good but heavy,"Generally very good for chinese cooking, with a large even cooking surface. Primary downside is the weight, which makes it something of a challenge to work with on the stove, and to clean."
1,Incredibly poorly made,"After 15 years, my Atlas pasta machine gave up the ghost, so I replaced it with this one. What a mistake. The directions state that you should run a batch of dough through the machine to remove any residual grit left over from factory assembly. But, the amount of machine oil and dirt being removed was incredible. I ran two batches through and was still found large amounts of oil and dirt coming out. Further, the dough began sticking to the machine and wouldn't go through fully. I don't know if this was due to the amount of residual factory oil in the machine or not, but it made a real mess. I spent about 1/2 hour with a toothpick cleaning it out.Worse, during the second batch I noticed that chrome was flaking off the rollers.At that point, I gave up and returned the machine. I've since gone and bought another Atlas pasta maker. After running dough through it once, I seem to have gotten all the factory dirt out, and it's working just fine now."
1,Great...for a little while.,"This pasta maker was a lot of fun out of the box. Lasagna, spaghetti, fettucine, easy as winding a fishing reel. The downside is that around the 5th use, the whole contraption locked up. It seized! The main roller bent after a little pressure was applied to see if I could free it. It's made out of some really thin, lightweight metal. So sad because I'm definitely hooked on fresh pasta! Mmmmmmmmmmmmm..... PS the warranty is so intricate and demanding, it's not worth going through the rigamarole to replace it."
3,villaware V150 Imperia Noodle Machine,It works very well however when washed it will show rust.we need to know how to properly clean and oil it.
1,Machined Wrong,"My mother bought me this for Christmas and I was so excited to make fresh whole wheat spaghetti! However, it wouldn't even make a flat sheet of pasta. Upon taking it apart to figure out what was wrong, we discovered that one of the rollers was machined incorrectly. The pivot was off center so the pasta was coming out ""wavy"". It wouldn't create a consistent thickness.I am going to have to replace it, and I will do it with another brand."
3,a pretty good machine,"I owned this machine years ago and really enjoyed using it. It is simple and pretty effective. The clamp could be of a better design. Being mechanical made for a great way for guests to become involved in making dinner. They cranked out the pasta while I worked on the rest of dinner. My big complaint is that this is chrome plate on steel and after a couple of years the plating flaked off making the machine useless. I have purchased one of the expensive motor driven machines and the gears in it destroyed themseves in about the same amout of time, so for the money this is still the machine to buy."
5,Villaware Imperia Pasta Machine,"You will never eat boxed noodles again! Homemade pasta is easy and fabulous. Do some research on the internet regarding mixing and standing of the dough. When you place the dough through the rollers, flour it and fold it in half each time on the largest setting (5 or 6 times) until you get a nice, even rectangular shape. Then proceed to the thinnest setting and you will have beautiful, wide noodles. Lay large noodles on a flour-sack cloth to air dry before cutting; about 10-15 minutes. Then cut into linguine. I hang my cut noodles over dowels placed between 2 open drawers to dry for a few hours. Once dried, I place them on a flour-sack cloth until I'm ready to use them You can store dried noodles in a cloth for several weeks -- if they last that long! It's one of my favorite Christmas gifts ever."
1,Not received,The person to whom I wished this item sent has not yet received the pasta machine. I am very disappointed with this order.
1,This product is not reliable,"The first item I got produced thick-thin-thick pasta sheet then I got a replace item. But one of it's pasta cutter made a huge noise and the other was very hard to rotate it. The final result, I returned the product.Ruiyan"
1,Not very strong/well built item.,"When we first got this, I thought it would work out very well, being it was nice and heavy (AKA probably built well) but after a few tries with a little extra flour like others suggested, the unit started grinding. Well I tried to get the rollers clean and then try it again and the unit started grinding again. It was getting harder to even turn the rollers with nothing in. Then the unit looked like it was twisting itself, and the little metal tabs holding the one piece together can not handle jamming up as they bent out very easy. So we gave up on it, after getting maybe a pound of good noodles out of it, I figured it was either defective or just not made to withstand any minor issues. So I returned it, now am going to try a full system from Lello and see how that goes.Lello 2720 Pastamaster 2200"
4,All good but handle,"The pasta maker works very well, but the handle falls off at least 4 times with every batch. I get lots of exercise bending down to pick it up."
3,"The Cucina Pro 177 is not perfect, but it does the job.","For what we paid for the pasta machine, I guess we really can't complain. The handle does not fit into the hole snugly; it's loose, and it will fall off if you are not holding it in place. And so, that is a little bit of a nuisance, but overall, it does the job. If it wasn't for the loose handle, we would probably think that it is just as good as the old Imperia model that we had. I suppose if you want to buy a pasta machine that is perfect and that will last a lifetime, the Marcato Atlas Pasta machine is probably your best option, but we couldn't afford to pay $90 for a pasta machine. And so, for $29, we're content with the purchase. And buying it from Amazon with no taxes and free delivery always helps out."
1,Horrible product,"Very cheaply made and broke with the first use. I have owned similar pasta rollers in the past, but this one was just flimsy and not well put together. I would not recommend this product."
1,Very Poor Product,"My wife and I purchased this pasta machine with the hopes of having the ability to make pasta on an occasional basis. It was inexpensive and we knew it would not be the ""cadillac"" of pasta makers. However, we were UNABLE TO MAKE ONE BATCH OF PASTA before the gears began to strip out and the rollers began to fall apart. We did not overload the unit, nor did we over work the unit. Since we had thrown the box it came in away (and it was rather cheap) I decided to take it apart and see what happened. What I found was some very very poor design and cheap parts. I guess its true...""Ya get what ya pay for!"" Avoid this pasta maker!"
1,Wrajax,Pay a little bit more and get a good pasta machine. This one broke the second time I used it. Very poor quality machine.
3,Almost a good pasta machine,"The CucinaPro 177 almost stay at my kitchen if there was not a tiny thing gets stuck to make the roller not turn!All the functions work fine, only when I try to make spaghetti, then a tiny metal piece get stuck into the teeth of the cutter, so even I try hard to shake it out, it didn't. I only can cut the spaghetti about 5 inches long then the roller can't move.I return model 177 and bought model 150 and very happy with the new machine. Fresh pasta is so delicious with everything!"
3,CucinaPro Pasta Maker,The CucinaPro Pasta Machine is OK for the money. I found it is suitable for a beginner who wants to try making pasta at home. The cutting attachment is limited to thin spaghetti and linguine. I did find the machine a bit on the flimsy side and the crank handle for rolling the pasta continually falls out of its slot. That is extremely frustrating. I would think the crank would fit tight enough to remain in place. I might recommend it as an inexpensive method to try pasta making before the home cook decides if he or she would like to invest in a higher grade or top of the line model.
5,Great machine,"I was quite pleased when I received this in the mail and even more pleased when I used it the first time. The machine is VERY heavy, durably made, and I think easy to clean. I had some fresh pasta made in less than 20 minutes -- and expect to get this time down to 10! If you like to cook, this is well worth the money. And, in addition to being healthy and tasty, homemade past is probably cheaper than dried. Furthermore, you can't buy sheet pasta-- something which is great for a variety of cuisines."
4,works well,"The Imperia Pasta Machine is well-made and easy enough to use. It doesn't take much effort at all to turn the crank when you're making pasta; a small child could easily perform this task. I find the pasta comes out better if you make it a little on the dry side, and if you go ahead and cut your flat sheets to the desired length before you make the noodles. Drawbacks: You have only one hand to work the dough with when you're cranking with the other hand, which slows you down a bit. Right-handed cooks will find the unit much easier to use if their kitchen has free space on its right hand side, or if they own a table that they don't mind using as a work surface."
4,"A little time consuming, but worth it","I've used electric pasta makers before, and the one's I've owned have cracked their faceplates or stressed their motors and been a bear to clean.The Villaware is fine for me to use. It cleans up a lot easier if the dough is very dry (which it should be, anyway). If any small bits of dough get caught, let the machine sit for an hour or two to let the dough dry. Hold it over the sink and crank it and the dough bits fall right out.If the machine tends to move on you, your counter top is too slick. Try placing a rubber jar opener under the machine (which also protects your countertop) and it shouldn't move. If you rub both sides of the sheets with flour before running them through, it will cut and not clump at all.I only had to run one small batch of dough through my machine to clean off the oil.Overall, it makes the lightest pasta I've ever had. So far, I love this thing. I think it's well worth the price."
4,Beats rolling out by hand!,"This machine is well-built, very sturdy and easy to use. The manual is also easy to follow and has enough basic recipes to get you started.However, you do need a generous lip on either your counter, table or other work surface to attach the grip securely; and it's not designed for left-handed users. I found that I have to strategically fix the machine to the breakfast bar side of my kitchen counter in order to get enough overhang for the grip plus enough surface for the rolled pasta to 'flow' to. It's a bit awkward, in my case; but, it's worth the effort.I personally find making fresh pasta fun and rewarding, and it makes great, inexpensive gifts."
4,Not for everyone,"There are many decent alternatives to homemade pasta out there in your local grocery store's frozen foods sections. Nevertheless, for those of you out there like me who grew up having grandma's homemade every Sunday, there is nothing that compares. In the beginning, this is more difficult than just buying and boiling pasta, but once you figure out how you like your pasta, it's easy.However, under no circumstance should you wash your machine or immerse it in water. Of course, it will begin to rust. You cannot get into all the parts to dry it. If you are not comfortable with this, rest in the comfort of the sanitary conditions of companies who mass-produce pasta."
1,Cheaply made,"We bought this product to make homemade pasta as a family. Unfortunately, the first time we used it, the fettucine side was broken. The gears were bent, so we made pasta using the angel hair side instead. When we got it out tonight, to use it for the second time ever, the angel hair side wouldn't cut the pasta all the way through, so it just came out as a big clump. We tried making it thinner, then thicker, but nothing worked. It was a huge waste of money!"
4,I like this machine!,"I got this machine very quick, and tried on it the day I got it and it worked good. The noodle I made with this machine is Chinese noodle, I guess the dough receipt is different from Italian noodle, it works good for me. I have a wood plate and one side stays in a slot where it is stored, I set the machine on the other side and I can handle the whole thing by myself. I agree to people who complain it needs two people to work on it, if the work plate places on counter and not fixed."
2,Broke after one use,"The machine appeared solid but the ""adjustable dough-dialer"" broke after using the machine for the second time. While it worked the machine made great paste but without a working dialer its not very useful, I returned the item."
1,Handle mechanism broke after third use!,"The pasta maker appears very well made when it arrived. Its heavy and solid.So, to our surprise after the third use, the hand breaks off entirely!My husband attempted to try and reassemble the handle but it was impossible, as the handle would need to be welded back, and is connected to the mechanism that allows it to move the pasta through. Very disappointed because it was rated so high! Just returned it."
1,Pasta Machine CucinaPro 177,"I purchased this machine for my Husband as a Christmas gift.He just used it last week and it was working great then all at once, it locked up on him and then the roll out size would not hold and became very inconsistent like a pin or something came out. Any way half of his pasta came out great the second part came out very inconsistent the roller would go back and forth large small large small so he ended up with some very thick noodles.I felt bad that I bought him some thing that would not work when he was excited to have received this. In addition, when I just went online to see about returning it the time has pasted and I would have to pay for returning and then they may or may not refund me any thing."
1,Not worth the money,"After reading the vague and extremely basic instructions, we tried to make our first batch. about half way through, the rollers jammed. Tried contacting the manufacturer only to be told the warranty doesn't cover this problem because they deemed it misuse. So I disassembled it and freed the rollers (due to poor machine work). Then the thickness adjustment knob failed. The thin metal used to make it actually tore. Don't bother with this one. Maybe others aren't so bad."
3,Used to make cannoli shells,"I used this pasta machine to roll out cannoli. It's easy to use, but I don't like how the increment holes on the knob are so close together that it's difficult to differentiate between one size and the next."
4,CucinaPro 177 Pasta Fresh Pasta Machine,Purchased for cake decorating. Love and would definitely recommend this product. Was very economic. Arrived promptly and in great condition. Thanks
2,a financial loss,"I don't know whether to keep it and incur a financial loss or send it back and spend even more money on the Shipping and Handling. The product was received in pieces and when we tried to fix it or put it together, it would fall apart again."
5,Love it!,"Our family was so excited to make our own pasta. A few days ago, we made fettucini. The roller was easy to use, as was the cutting attachment. There was pasta all our our counter! It was so much fun, and it really tasted different and better than store-bought. We hope to make our own ravioli later this week!"
1,Be careful...got wrong item from Target,"Be care in ordering this. I ordered from Target and got the wrong item, a CucinaPro Pasta Fresh Maker. Not quite the right item! Plastic handle and wrong brand. Order elsewhere."
2,broken,The item was broken when it arrived. I asked for a return through UPS and it was pretty easy. The item got picked up as scheduled and I got the full-refund not too long after.
1,Villaware = Junk,"All I can say is that this machine will give you headaches and a desire to throw it out the window. Plain and simple, the machine does not work. If you have the patience of Job and the gulibility of a 3 year old, you may say that this is a great machine, but it definitely does not meet up to the glowing reviews given here. The Villaware Imperia Pasta Machine is made cheaply, assembled cheaply, and is unsanitary and perhaps even dangerous as gobs of machine oil come off of the rollers. Once you can't see it, there still is unseen residue on your pasta. The dough cannot be cleaned off of the rollers or the cutting blades and remains there to fester microbes and all sorts of nasty things. Added to this, the machine does not cut pasta very well. The noodles consistantly were clumpled together no matter what dough mixture was sent through the rollers. This machine is a scam and a failure."
1,sent me the wrong product,"I ordered a noodle machine, but a pasta machine was sent to me. It is also from a different brand. It took me a lot of time and a few phone calls to return it and get my refund."
1,"Poor Design, Doesn't Last","I received the CucinaPro 177 Pasta Maker for Christmas. After four uses it is garbage. The machine does not clamp well to the counter which causes two problems: 1) you need an extra person to hold the machine for you while you are running the pasta through and 2) due to the lack of support the mechanisms will bend over time making the machine useless (hence the reason it is now garbage). One other problem with this design is the handle does not snap into place for rolling. If you're not careful the handle will fall out. After repeated landings on my foot this aspect of the machine got very annoying. As with other reviewers I was appalled at the amount of oil on the machine and how much flaking the chrome does, not appetizing. I'm going to look into a KitchenAid machine and get the pasta making attachment."
5,Outstanding product whcih makes outstanding pasta !,"I am an Italian living in Michigan since five years and I was missing the taste of the real home made pasta of my Country. I ordere the Imperia machine and my wife and I couldn't be happier. It is easy to use, easy to clean, incredibily sturdy and well made. And, most of all, it makes a wonderful pasta. It is also fun to use. I would recommend it to anyone."
1,Chrome flakes off in less than 2 years,"I have one of these Villaware rollers. The chrome flaked off of the rollers and cutters in less than two years, just after the warranty period expired. If you are excited about having a new toy that works for a short period of time then buy, but this will not endure time."
3,A solid poker game,This is the first Texas Holdem game that I have bought for a video game system and I am having a good time with it. The AI has been the best that I have been up against so far and creating a character on here was fun as well. There are a few problems that become annoying over time. Every time you or an opponent acts they say these really dumb comments and the same ones are said over and over. I am sure you can turn off that feature so that can be solved but the graphics are really bad and there is nothing to do about that. You would expect more from a game with limited surroundings.
3,Fun Fun - But,"I loved the game, but I think if your serious about poker there may be afew things you might like added. A teaching mode where you receivecomments on your play. A percentage indicator telling you your chancesof winning (part of the teaching mode).Also the announcers comments are so boring and so repetitive you couldbarf, thank god you can turn it off. The comments should be moreinformative (yes teaching mode).So you wonder why I gave it 4 stars, well because I enjoy playing thepoker side of it. Its fun worth 4 stars."
1,Never saw that coming!,"I was just playing this game and pulled a three of a kind sevens. I went all in with another player. Turned out he had a three of a kind sevens, also. That's six sevens. How does that happen? Isn't there only four in a deck, or have I been living in the twilight zone all this time? Either way, I know I've never seen that in a real poker game."
3,Goddess of Eire,"For centuries, Eriu, goddess of Ireland, had spent one night only with the Ard Ri, the high king ""elect"", to confirm him in his office. After that night, they parted, never to see one another again, but for Parlan, the newest Ard Ri, that is not enough. No other woman will now do for him, and his defiance brings a curse upon the land. To break the curse and atone for his pride, Parlan must go on a quest to retrieve four sacred artifacts that will allow him to face the Black Dragon with a prayer of winning. Eriu herself chooses to help him, for she has lost her heart to the proud king.*** Forbidden love and legend mingle in this epic quest. This modern story has the feel of being taken straight from myth, but is original. Though the characterization is a bit light, the epiphany in the end is enough payoff to compensate for that. ***Amanda Killgore"
3,"Solid, yet Typical Advice","This books is filled with lots of advice, although most everyone will already know what is being said. It certainly doesnt hurt to get a good reminder now and then though.I found The Romantic's Guide, also written from a Christian perspective, to be a bit more unique, creative and inventive. And it has ideas for both men and women. Get them both."
1,Boring,I couldn't get through this at all. Very boring and mundane with the old stand by run of the mill advice about putting him first. save your money and don't buy this one.
5,A testatment to my obscure taste in comics.,I love this series. The writer of this comic new exactly what he was doing when he write this. If there was an American TV show of this I would watch in an instant. Alas It seems the availablilty of this comic is some what sarce where I live. You would think living near chiacgo and being next to a bunch comic stores would help right? NOOOOOOO! I can't find the second volume anywhere. (Except for here.) It seems this is a classic example of what I want to is what other people don't seem to be to interested in. I love watch the character Jan talk about food and how he can really manipulate to be just about anything he wants it to be. The only problem is that DIAMOND DIRECT DIDN'T HAVE ISSUES 2 AND 3! Comic book distributors didn't have the freakin' comics! I went to other store only to see the had all the later issues. My quest must continue!
4,Presto Microwave Bacon Cooker,This worked out good except that I was hoping it was little larger so that I could fit a whole package of Bacon on it. I had to over lap the bacon strips to fit the whole package on it. That worked out OK. I just had to pull the strips apart afterwards. I need to practice with the cooking time though. You can get your bacon really crispy or not crispy enough. But I love the fact that there was no mess in the microwave as long as you put a paper towel over it to catch the splattering like the directions says. This beats cooking over a stove and getting splattered from the grease.No issues with shipping and seller.
5,Best bacon ever!,"After my 20+ year old microwave bacon cooker developed a stress fracture it was time to look for another. A reviewer's comment about this one working in a microwave with a turntable caught my attention. I still have the 20+ year old microwave and a bacon cooker like my old style would still work quite well in it. However, I decided to keep my options open for that time when the microwave bites the dust. We couldn't be happier with this bacon cooker. We like very crisp, grease-free (as close as can be possible with bacon!) bacon. This cooker does just that and clean up is a breeze. I hope this one lasts 20+ years!"
2,Microwaved bacon with this is inconsistent,"I've found this product to be so-so. After using it several times, I've concluded that traditional pan fried bacon tastes much better with a more satisfying texture. The best thing I can say about this bacon cooker is that it is a relatively simple process and the bacon doesn't sit in grease at any time while cooking. The results, however, have varied from poor to mediocre so I'll probably stick with pan fried bacon for 5 or less rashers or bake it in the oven when I need lots of rashers at the same time, which has always come out great. Also, this product is less easy to clean than either a fry pan or a baking tray, which are each a single surface. With this, you have to clean 5 separate components."
5,Bacon Cooker,This is the best microwave bacon cooker ever! When they first came out I bought a different one and it melted in the microwave. This one makes crispy bacon with little clean up. Would highly recomend this product. I bought one for my daugher also.
4,great fat-away device,"very good at getting the bacon fat away from the bacon, for the price-it's o.k..........but not sturdy enough for the long haul."
5,"Nice Product, Good Results","Nice design - it fits in a smaller microwave but still cooks 10 pieces of bacon. The results are good, too, with the bacon cooking up better than it does in a fry pan, and there is hardly any grease (though I should mention that I only use the product with turkey bacon). It's easy to clean and store because the uprights come apart and reassemble easitly."
3,No as good as the Makin Bacon Microwave Rack,It works but does not get the bacon as crispy as the Makin Bacon Microwave Rack. I bought one of each as I thought this one would work well and I have used the Makin Bacon one before. Wish I would have just bought two of the Makin Bacon racks!
2,"Had great expectations, sadly disappointed","I purchased this after reading what seemed like were above average or pretty good reviews. Got it on sale for around $12 with tax. I was disappointed. Very disappointed. Tried 2 different brands and types of bacon. One was normal cut thinner pieces and the other was a thicker cut bacon. I adjusted the cooking times since I did two batches of each. It didn't matter how short or long I cooked the bacon, it either wasn't done enough or was burned on the ends. Plus I thought this would make it crisp. To me it tasted rubbery. Sorry but this is being donated at the end of the year to Goodwill. Save your money and either pan fry or bake your bacon in the oven."
4,Great for reducing the greasy smell from frying bacon..,"We love bacon, but that greasy smell that lingers in the kitchen for several hours afterwards makes me want to fry it less and less, so we decided to give this a try. So glad we did! There is very little greasy smell and clean up is really quick and easy.The bacon doesn't look exactly like bacon fried in a pan, but the taste is really close. We like our bacon just a little crunchy and this delivered. Now we can have bacon even on hot days (since we don't have to open windows to air out the kitchen)!!!"
3,"Not great, not terrible...","I hate cooking bacon on the stove, so this seemed like the perfect solution. Microwaving the bacon did control the odor, but it turned out very dry, and cooking the bacon took a very long time. You can only cook a few slices at a time.It would probably be great for making bacon-bits for salads, or bacon for BLTs, but as a breakfast side, it was too dry. Clean up was very easy though."
1,Bad bacon cooker,"This tremendously failed. Although fat did drip down away from the bacon, it was hard to contain splatters under the paper towel. Most importantly, it did not allow for the bacon to cook evenly. We threw it away, it was that bad."
4,Works fine!,Just take the time to learn how Bacon behaves in your microwave with this great gadget. Easy cleanup. Cover with a paper towel while cooking to prevent splatter.
2,Uneven cooking,"I really wanted this to work, but with multiple tries, we always get unevenly cooked bacon. We gave it to our daughter who is having similar poor results."
4,Does what it says.,Does fairly well considering you are microwaving foods. The only complaint I have is that it doesn't cook evenly. It's a quick meal though in a pinch.
4,"I like it, but it has one problem","It makes good bacon, especially if you like crispy bacon. Your bacon comes out bent but that's no big deal to me. There is one problem that could be a big deal, and that is the racks get warped from the heat. One set is so warped they almost won't go together. Almost but so far I can put them together, I am worried for how long because I use it a couple times every day. I think that when it does break I will try the cooker that has the three t shaped bars, it looks like it wouldn't have the warping problems"
5,Great product,PowerCrisp does everything it promised. Easy preparation and clean up. Bacon is REALLY crisp. Bought as a gift for my husband and he loves it.
3,Bent bacon,"I like the fact that it drips most of the grease out. Clean up is a breeze. It's very easy to use. The only gripe I have is that all your bacon comes out the shave of a ""V"". It's a small gripe, not enough to keep me from recommending it."
4,Presto Microwave Bacon Cooker,It does a really nice job. We used to microwave it on a plate and cover with a paper towel. This does a much better job with far less mess
3,It takes some getting used to,"As the title suggests, I believe this takes a few tries before you figure out how to get the bacon the way you want it. Overall, it's a pretty good product"
5,Great Microwave Bacon!!,Got this as a Christmas gift for my dad who lovesss bacon! I was sold on the fact that this allows all the grease to drain while it cooks which reduces a lot of the fat intake! The bacon is very crispy and good! He liked it which means it's a great product!
5,Quite Surprised,"I was a little skeptical at first, and it took a few tries to know the right amount of time to cook the slices but after you get that right, the next problem was oh it's going to be so greasy and a pain to clean since I don't have a dishwasher..I put soap in it and ran hot water over it and what a breeze it was to clean, my hands weren't all greasy etc. I love it..now the problem is with being able to make bacon so easily I'm bound to eat more of it!!"
1,Sweet Old Bob,"It only holds 8 pieces of bacon,when 12 pieces are in a normal pound.A piece of bacon is longer than the holder so you have to cut bacon in half in order to use. therefore it takes twice as long to cook bacon.I am using bottom part of cooker as my dogs dish.threw the rest away.Easier and much less costly to take paper plate,put row of paper towels and bacon on top, paper towel, layer of bacon etc.unyil all pieces are on plate. cover with another paper towel and cook in microvave for about 12 minutes(1200 Watt microwave.product is useless in my estimation!!!"
1,Too big for my microwave,"Still frying bacon! I wish that the listing and the product box had stated the microwave minimum dimensions that this bacon cooker would fit. I washed and assembled the cooker only to find that it would not fit into my average-sized microwave. Unfortunately, I can't rate HOW it works. I'm still frying."
2,"It does what it says, but bacon is a bit chewy.","I bought this as a way to make bacon easily. We usually use the broiler or buy the precooked microwave bacon. I thought this would make things faster. When cooked as instructed, the bacon came out with a rubbery texture. If I cooked it a little longer, it burn't quickly, while other pieces on the device were still rubbery. We buy organic bacon without nitrates so I don't know of that changes how it microwaves, but I won't use this device regularly."
2,It cooks bacon,"but not very well. The bacon is tough and for some reason the cooking smell is vile. I cook bacon everyday and I though this would be less mess...and I guess it is.. doesn't splatter if you cover with paper towels, but cooking in the pan is much better tasting.kind of a pain to clean as well."
5,JUST WHAT WE NEEDED!,"My husband likes to make his own breakfast, but didn't like the way bacon turned out when microwaved on a plate. I got him this and he loves it. Also, the ""tent"" structure helps him remember to put paper towels over the top...which he often forgot when miking on a plate. Results: Cleaner microwave for me, tastier bacon for him. Easy to take apart and wash and put back together. We are recommending it to our family and friends."
3,Good concept but not for me,"The product seemed great, but I didn't use it more than 2 times.Pros:QuickCleanCan cook more strips than a panCons:Removes a lot of the fat, leaving the bacon bland tasting/driveClean up without a dishwasher can still be annoying, I prefer cleaning my pot.This is just my opinion, and I love the flavor of the bacon cooked in it's own juices, but for those trying to have dry bacon I guess it will work."
2,Not a good choice for crisp bacon,"This bacon cooker seems to take a lot longer to cook the bacon. It is also a bit more difficult to clean after use as compared with the flat type bacon cooker. I will still use it because I don't like my bacon crisp however, my wife flatly refuses to use it again."
5,best bacon cooker,"best bacon ever 1 min. per slice and bacon comes out perfect. the best part know watching or turning. you can cook rest of itemes (potatoes,eggs,ect.) as bacon cooks."
4,"Easy to use, good results, but leaves microwave greasy","This does a pretty good job cooking bacon, especially if you just need some for another dish, such as a quiche. But after use, the inside of the microwave is a little greasy. Still, microwaves always seem to need cleaning anyway, and some dish washing liquid on a damp paper towel cleans things up without too much trouble. It is also worth noting that the plastic pan catches the grease, which, mercifully, is sufficiently far removed from the bacon--which is not sopping wet with grease. The pan's rectangular shape also makes pouring the grease into a jar pretty easy, by allowing any one of the corners to be used as a spout. The whole thing can then go in the dishwasher for the final clean up."
4,Presto Microwave Bacon Cooker,Works quite well - I was suprised! Bacon is crisp and no grease splattered stove top and skillet to clean!
5,Best Christmas Present - EVER!!!,My wife got this for me for Christmas this year. Hands down - it is the greatest invention since the light bulb. I had perfect strips of thick-cut bacon in about 2 minutes and 30 seconds. There is almost zero mess. Washing the item is a snap. I would highly recommend this product.
5,Hilarious!,"I LOVED this book. It had me laughing out loud; once I even snorted wine out of my nose. (A high caliber endorsement indeed!) It's definitely not just for young adults. Nutshell: It's ""the Onion"" meets Donna Tart's ""Secret History"" meets ""The Catcher in the Rye"", if you are a fan of one (or all) of these, definitely give ""Freshman"" a read!"
3,A teenager book that tries hard,I found it amusing but could tell the humor is a bit forced. Still likable book that gives some insight (albeit distorted) of going to an IVY league school.
3,Small but sturdy,"I bought this ball because regular volleyballs were landing in a shrub in our yard and getting punctured. It is a fine substitute when you're playing around in the yard, though it is a little smaller than a regular volleyball. However, my daughter joined a club team and became very engaged in the sport, so she needs real volleyballs to practice. The poor shrub had to go.If you're looking for a good, durable ball for playing in the yard or on the beach, this ball should do the trick for you."
3,Little disappointed,"Bought this ball to replace a lost mini-basketball for a ""little tikes"" hoop, but I didn't realize these things were foam. My toddler cried out happily when I gave him his new ball and promptly bit a chunk out of it.So now it sits on a shelf waiting for him to be old enough to know not to eat his toys and I ended up looking for a proper ""little tikes"" replacement ball.I guess I should have read a little better what the description said. Not a bad product, but certainly not for tots."
1,Terrible product,I ordered two of these. The first one split and made a fountain on the second use. I called and Amazon sent a replacement. Today I put the second one in use and it sprang a fountain the first time. I am sending back all three of them. It's poor material and poor design. It's also so stiff that you need to lay it out in the sun for a day to uncurl before you can even think about using it. AWFUL!!!
3,"Good stories, but....","As a baseball fan reading this book and not particularly a Yankee fan I found it an enjoyable read that invites a question and a comment.How do you write a book about individual Yankees and omit Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris? I would think that even current Yankee players who might read this would be surprised by that.The book was written pre-2004 and several ties mention was made of ""The Curse"" (over the Red sox) staying in place. Considering ""The Curse"" obviously didn't work the season after the book was written, that tends to cancel out some of the obvious obnoxious Yankee fan statements in the book. The author shows that attitude of ""Well, he's not a Yankee so he's not the best player at his position"". Typical."
2,"Yeah, ok, but....","The concept of this book is all very well, and I think the idea of creating a stepfamily plan is quite a good one, but the execution is uninspiring: the writing style is boring, the layout presents you with big chunks of dense text and overall the tone isn't at all engaging.Worst of all, though, the author tells stepparents once again that they ""have to put the children first"" and accept being second for their partner. Come on, there is reliable, recent research that shows that this is the best possible recipe for another divorce!An approach that is proven to be far more effective for conserving remarriages and ultimately more stable for the children is for the couple to focus on becoming a strong team and to parent from that team. Remarriage experts agree that guilting stepparents into accepting ""second place"" is not the way to make a successful stepfamily.Susan Wisdom's ""Stepcoupling"" is a far better, more engaging and more helpful book for struggling stepfamilies."
4,So close to perfection,"If you love McSweeney's then you'll obviously love this book. I just wish the staff would chill out on the war stuff. We hear about it and are dealing with the injustices of war constantly (by ""we"" I am referring to the highly intelligent group of homeboys and homegirls that I am quite sure make up the core of McSweeney's readers). Hopefully people are in action and trying to help and I know that is what Eggers and Co. are doing with this issue and some of the others which is noble...but it feels more and more like I'm reading just to remind myself that I'm lucky to be a white American and unlucky that my country is run by idiots.Regardless, the writing is as good as ever and buy the issue if you don't have it already. There is no reason for you to have a gaping hole on your bookshelf or in your McSweeney's lineup. Once you have purchased this issue, go to their website and get a subscription. I shouldn't have to tell you this.America."
2,weak,"This doesn't work properly. Like most people, I have found this to be a disappointment. Not all the figures work properly, and almost none of them say more than one thing when they do work. ..."
2,Very Poor Quality,"How can a company continue to market this toy when it does not even work properly? It is a nice looking set, but the voices do not even work with every button. The company should have redesigned this a long time ago before it continues to sell this."
3,Main Street Skids,"At first I loved this set - but after a while I started to realize some of it's down sides. It does not always read the Intel chip, and spouts random phrases at you when you are no where near the thing. At 3 AM I heard Krusty cry out (freaky), & I don't own a Krusty figure. This set is the right idea, but is not high quality or amazingly durable. Try again Playmates...."
2,dissapointed,tis is a very cool item. but like many others have complained i recieved my item in a broken condition. only one of my tallking areas actually worked the others were either damadged or broken. im very dissapointed espessialy considewring the price tag
3,Fun .. yet some problems,We actually bought ours at Toys R Us. We have the same problems as other people. About 4 of the 6 pegs work. You have to push the character on the peg to hear its voice. The button just gets you the traffic default sound. It's still worth it if you get it on sale though.
3,"Great expectations, no so good results","I think this book does not make Jamie a favor, its not what i was expecting for, its more of a lots of pictures, a story behind a certain food, how to list and tips, but not really the best for cooking or for recipes, i feel that some chapters are really good, but there is something missing in this book that will leave you wondering if its more of a book for reading while in bead that one to be sitting on took of your kitchen, great illustrations and pictures but i feel that is lacking some content"
2,not very practical or appealing,"Just looking at the pictures (as many of Jamie, it seems, as of the food) and reading the recipes, I tagged 6 as both appealing and do-able. That's not too many from a book of this size. Of course it's all a matter of personal taste, but just for example, an inordinate number of recipes call for mint, which is fine if you're crazy about mint. If not, not. I'd recommend leafing through this at the library or book store before purchasing."
2,Go back to the source of Ifa The Odus,"For any one who truly studies the Yoruba culture, please avoid these types of books. If you are a novice or a new initiate into Ifa or Santeria..allow your God parents to teach you divination. Please remember all people or devotess have different paths. All worshippers are not chosen to divine for themselves or others. These type of books are to attract other energies to our culture. Be ware. I am sure the author had good intentions( has few years as an orisa initaite) but the content is confusing, language challenging and too advance for any young omo orisa. Be careful...everything is not for everybody!!!"
5,A 'must' for any student of Afro-Cuban spirituality.,"Secrets Of Afro-Cuban Divination focuses on how to cast the Diloggun, the oracle of the Orishas which is more than an African oracle, but a spiritual process blending ritual with insight. Secrets Of Afro-Cuban Divination is the first to provide complete details on how to cast and read the Diloggun, from opening and closing the oracle to an analysis of the prayers associated with the process. A 'must' for any student of Afro-Cuban spirituality."
1,"A Waste of Money, and Time, Disrespectful of the Religion","Don't waste yoru time buying this book. He focuses only on Ebo, and never talks about the meanings of the Odu. And he does not understand that the Ebo is decided upon through Divination, by asking and is not fixed for each Odu. he never discusses refranes at all. When the author wrote this book, he had not yet completed his first year of initiation. It is considered very disrespectful in Santeria for someone with that little experience to think he knows anything. It takes years to learn the Cowerie shells. The author was arrogant and disrespectful for writing a book, which anyone with any real experience in the religion can see is a waste of paper."
4,False Trumpets But Still Satisfying,"A gripping play but somewhat false-trumpeted. True, it is evil that a community rises up against an individual and the individual is hardly the criminal we are led to believe he is. His so-called crime is trivial, however, and the discovery that his crime is trivial does not make the play more dramatic or more interesting than the initial set-up. However, there is some drama with a weak character in the play since he does find and does stick to his purpose.The play is morally uplifting, spiritually revivifying despite the overall weakness in the structure."
2,Lousy romance,"I picked this book out because I tend to like fantasy/science fiction with a good romance. I was quickly disappointed. The storyline, disguised as fantasy, quickly devolved into obviously sexist and remarkably uninteresting quasi-romantic blather. The ""strong"" female character was irritating and the male characters (father and male lead) always knew best. The heroine was eventually bent to the will of the men and decided that she liked it. The occasional sex scenes were uninspiring. Ugh."
1,Don't recommend it,Wouldn't recommend buying fragrances online. When they transport the fragrance it gets warm and ruins the smell. Kind of pissed about my recent purchase.
5,Different,"This is the first MIXED set of the Ring that I've seen. I was expecting the '52 Keilberth live recordings. That said, for the price, this is a good buy. The sound is clear and strong. Set contains Das Rheingold/Keilberth 1952, Die Walkure/Furtwangler 1954, Siegfried/Keilberth 1953, Gotterdammerung/Keilberth 1952. I view this not as a Complete Ring Cycle, but four good recordings of the individual operas the comprise the Ring. Not bad for the price."
3,"Good Name, So...So Product","I needed a slow cooker in which to cook a roast or poultry. I have a smaller older model crock pot from this manufacturer which I still use and consider a good appliance. My decision to buy this model was primarily based on my satisfaction with the older unit. My primary dissatifaction with this model is that the low cook setting seems to be useless; the high setting works fine. Next, the overall construction is cheap. The removable crock is heavy duty; however the heating unit is flimsy. I pressed lightly on the sheet metal side of the heating unit and was afraid I had damaged it. I liked the glass lid(as opposed to the plastic lid of my older model); however, the glass is too thin. A heavier glass lid would help prevent breakage, and it would not lift up as much during the cooking process. Overall, the unit worked satisfactorily on the high setting but it is not of quality construction."
2,Slow is right,"Just purchased this oval slow cooker to make soup. Even with the dial turned to ""high"" after several hours, it didn't even reach a simmering point. The recipe calls for the soup to cook all day on low heat and there may not be enough hours in a day for this. What if I wanted to saute something first?"
3,Some of them are really good,"Mason writes about a dozen short stories in this collection. Many of them are about women and all are about people reviewing their lives, the decisions they've made, the people they've loved. The stories are involving -- the kind of story that pulls you in and when you finish the story, look up and are confused as to where you are. But, while I enjoyed many of the stories, there were a few that fell short of the brilliance of the others. Many of the stories rate 4 or 5 stars, the few I didn't enjoy brought the overall rating down for me."
4,a story about folks in western kentucky,"i enjoyed these stories as they were based in an area not too far from where i grew up in Southeast Missouri. i could recognize the type of characters and it made for great, light reading. It made me want to read more work by the author."
3,Not Mason's Best,"I had the overwhelming sense that I had read these stories before, and that they were better the first time. Mason covers a lot of old ground here, and while a few of the stories offer new perspectives, many of them feel like retreads.The best thing about Zigzagging over her other short story collections is it's more recent: Mason's reliance on up-to-the-minute references make her stories dated (though still excellent).If you've never read Mason's other collections, give them a look first."
1,Zigzagging down a wild trail,"Mason's book went nowhere. Her characters were all losers, misfits, chaos-junkies. How anyone in their right mind could champion this book is beyond me. Our book club thought it was the worst we've read in a long time. My only advice to anyone considering ""Zigzagging"" is to slither along to another title. Anything else is preferable.Dr. Bob Marlowe"
4,Killer anthem rock without the normal hype!,"If you like altenative music, but tire of the Third-Eye-Blind-rubbish you are forced to listen to on a regular basis on commercial-alternacrap-radio, This is your band! Heavy roots inspired, with heart-felt rhythm! This EP makes you beg for a full-length CD. If I had 8 hands I would give a wopping eight thumbs up. Gotta love NOD!"
3,Ok for the price - update,"My blender had given out. I wanted something inexpensive until I decided on the blender I really wanted. This one is very light-weight and needs to held down when operating or the jar will bounce off. It is also very noisy. It does however blend, liquefies, and chops well. Makes good smoothies & Frozen drinks. *** 5/17/08 I am adding an update to my review- I've had this a few months & the buttons are cracking and breaking off from the vibrations of the blender. Not very good for long term use."
1,Blender was a let down,The Proctor Silex 57171 7-Speed Blender was a let down on the performance.It seems like it has more cons than pros.The operational sound is real big.All my neighbors get to know that Im blending/grinding when I use the blender.The blades are not designed for fine grinding.It takes a lot of effort to get a finely made juice.Im not a convinced customer.Regards
5,I love my blender,It's powerful and has a pulse which helps stir things and saves the motor from overwork. I'm happy with it for the price. Good value.
4,good deal,The Proctor Silex Blender is quite good in making smoothies and blending things in general. It has multi-speeds as well as a high and low pulse option.
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED,Last week I purchased this blender as a gift. Three days later it arrived and I got the wrong one. The instuctions didn't match whatI ordered. a proctor silex 57171 7 speed blender and an 8 speed blender came. The instructions were for the blender that was supposed to come so I couldn't use this one. I was VERY DISAPPOINTED that Amazon sent me a different appliance than what I ordered!!!!!!!! Gonna return this appliance and try again.
2,Cheap little blender,The blender can in quick time. The quality is what you pay for.I saw the same blender at a dollar store for 15 dollars.
4,Great for the price,"Great for making smoothy, and crushes ice nicely. The jug is plastic; I wish it were a bit more sturdy. Would recommend to anyone."
1,Cheap is Cheap no mater what the price,"This is a cheap, poorly made machine. Noisy, flimsy, weak, and it broke (the blender tank is plastic, not glass, and broke within a couple of weeks. Wasn't expensive, but why should an inferior product be expensive! Buy a real blender, not this one."
4,Very good value,"This is the first new blender I've purchased in a few years so it took me a while to decide which one to purchase. The Proctor Silex was a good choice; I am very happy with this blender. It works great and gives me consistent results every time. I like the different settings available, although I'm not a gourmet cook by any means and probably won't use half of them! My only complaint is that it is a little noisier than I thought it should be, but overall I'm very happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced blender."
1,No way,"I would not recommend this blender, I used it once and it stopped working. The only plus is when I contacted the seller they immediately credited my account and were very professional and nice to do business with. They offered to send me another blender and when I declined they refunded my money with no hassles. No to the blender, Yes to the company as far as being nice to deal with."
4,A smart chooice,The mixer blender is great for most day to day purposes.It can also be stored very easily.In short an smart choice.
1,Lasted three weeks,"Hoping for a basic, inexpensive blender, I made the mistake of picking this up.I used it for smoothies, consisting of mostly yogurt, banana, frozen blueberries, whey protein, etc. Not exactly demanding stuff.Used every few days, it died after three weeks. Motor just slowly lost power. Consider yourself warned..."
4,I love it!,"I bought this blender cause I just wanted a cheap one for making smoothies. This one works great. it has a hard time with my frozen berries - I freeze them straight from the market and they are bricks - but eventually chops them down. In fact, it's so strong it chopped up a wooden spoon."
3,Does not handle frozen fruit,"I have no idea if a blender at this price should be expected to handle frozen fruit, but based on the reviews I read, it seemed to me that it would. It takes far too long for me to mush frozen fruit and even takes too long to crush my ice cubes. I only bought this to make smoothies, and I am wishing I had bought a higher-end model now. The item seems well-made though."
2,Gave it to my mother-in-law,The only thing this is good for are smoothies. The speeds don't really make a difference because the blade is not strong enough for other foods.
4,Plastic blender,"I bought this as a gift for my parents over 2 years ago. I am unaware of how much they actually use it, but it still works. It was very cheap for a blender, around $25 USD, but it is all plastic. It works well when I use it, although it does stink like burning rubber from the motor."
1,Lumpy lumpy lumpy,"Every smoothie came out lumpy, and with a bit of plastic aftertaste. I've had three blenders in the past. All could chop up almonds if you waited long enough, added a little juice, and tapped the sides. This thing has such a large and round jar with such small blades that it will just not reach every piece. Lumps and more lumps. I even tried sharpening the blades. The Krups turned almonds to powder in 10 seconds. This turnes almonds to small pieces in 2 minutes. So it makes a good alarm clock to wake the whole house. Even the banana was still lumpy. I read all these reviews and no one mentioned this problem. I'm definitely getting a different blender."
4,Long Lasting Blender,"According to Amazon, I purchased this particular blender in 2007. It is now December 2012 and it still is running strong.I have used it over the years for everything from milkshakes to blending items for canning. We don't do a lot of ice crushing, so I can't testify to that. It has a good selection of speeds, the pulse works well, and best of all, it cleans up easily.Not a very glamorous review - but I think the longevity speaks for itself."
3,get what you pay for,"There's nothing really ""wrong"" with this blender. It works like you would expect. It's just a cheap product. Plastic casing, plastic lid, plastic container. I have a Ninja blender that I bought 6 months ago which is much better (it also cost $100). I used this blender for smoothies, usually fruit along with some kale or spinach. You couldn't load too much into this blender before it would clog up, so there is a lot of manual stirring that must take place in order to get a good mix. In retrospect I'd spend a little more dough the first time around and get something more powerful, with a glass container."
4,works for years,"I used my blender for years and years, and I'm thinking of replacing it with the same model. It's not intended for heavy duty - if you need to crush a lot of ice this may not be for you. Very good for soups, smoothies, dips, and guacamole. I recommend it."
3,Smells a bit funky,"This blender works well for the only thing we bought it for- smoothies. Although, it does have a bit of a weird smell when we use it sometimes- a sort of electrical burn type of smell. Not sure how long it will last."
2,Just ok,"Cheapest price and you get what you pay for. Base is solid and sturdy but the blender light plastic, and doesn't sit tight in the base when you blend. It shifts slightly and its pretty loud. But if you need an extra blender, or a plastic one for safety reasons, this one will do the trick."
4,nice item for the price,"work well for blending fruit, and make smoothie/shake.But when you try to blend ice, it may not powerful enough."
3,So-so Blender,"Though I have no complaints with the blender overall, I feel that the blender is very flimsy and will break any moment.For example, the blender cup does not fit snugly into the rotating bottom and the blender has some trouble crushing ice cubes (start to smell burning plastic).Still, it's a decent blender given the price."
3,good,"have been using this product for 6 months now, and it has not complained even once....as yet....i got it very cheap, and so its good performance surprises me."
2,Extremly overpriced,I lost the one that came with the lens so I was a captive audience to purchase a replacement. Good quality just way to expensive for a lens hood
2,Not so great,I don't think this cream is so great at all. It leaves my skin feeling drier and more wrinkled than when I put it on! Sorry I took the chance on this basic Olay. Maybe the Regenerist line is better.
5,Saves you big bucks,"This book can save you big bucks by stopping you from overshopping for baby -- something that is all too easy to do when you're really not sure what you need or what features to look for when you are shopping for baby gear. And because this book is updated on a regular basis, you can feel confident that you're getting reliable information that takes into account up-to-date safety recommendations."
3,Good starting point,"This book is the most comprehensive guide for baby gear, but seems geared for suburban consumers (e.g., their advice to put a pack n play play yard in the parent's bedroom as a baby sleep area assumes a pretty big bedroom). I actually found the other book, Girlfriend's Gd to Baby Gear, a little more useful because it has a stronger focus on safety and conveyed a clearer sense of how to use all of the gear. The Baby Bargains book is a handy reference though if you can get past some of the weird judgement calls and its lame jokes."
4,More than just bargains,"Great stuff-I used an earlier edition of this book to buy everything from maternity clothes to my son's crib and stroller etc. etc. And when the crib I had so painstakingly selected using this book turned out to have a defect, the Fields kindly wrote back and stood behind their recommendation, helping me to contact the manufacturer and solve the problem. Now, if I could just get my toddler to actually sleep in the crib..."
1,Go with BEST BABY PRODUCTS instead,"BABY BARGAINS is okay, but you've got to wonder about how they test their products and how they come up with their buying advice. After all, they're not Consumer Reports. Plus, the book is over a year old and baby products change quickly. I decided to go with CONSUMER REPORTS BEST BABY PRODUCTS and I found it more helpful because it's new and the advice is unbiased."
1,Not sold on Baby Bargains,"Someone gave me this book after I announced I was pregnant. I have read through most of it trying to figure out what exactly our baby needs and what he doesn't. Instead of finding helpful advice, however, I found that this book essentially ignores breastfeeding and cloth-diapering (both are growing in popularity in our society). I also began to wonder if Target and Wal-Mart paid these authors to write this book, given how many times these particular retailers were referenced as the best places to buy things. My advice: save your money, ask other parents for advice, borrow some clothes from friends, and remember that all babies really need is food, love, and a safe place to sleep!"
1,The authors discriminate against gay parents,"This book is biased and discriminates against gay parents and the average blue collar worker who can not afford much. YOU DO NOT SAVE MONEY with this book. There are no coupons, no deals, no information on how to save money.The authors kids are teenagers so they rely on a few opinions of other people with kids to get their information but they are all from non-gay parents. A better sourceis Babies R Us in store service that is FREE or their newsletter. (...)"
2,"Excellent Resource -- However, updated version is available","I've found this book to provide invaluable guidance for the harrowing and uncertain process of getting the needed (and best) things we'll need for our first baby.However -- a newer (2010) version of the book is available, so I would not recommend buying this 2003 version, as it will not provide evaluations of most products/models you will see in the stores today. Best to purchase the most up-to-date copy of the book (which I did shortly after I received this one)."
4,Great book for new parents,"This book helps you through the maze of deciding what to buy for your new baby, and then how to make the decision when confronted with so many choices for each purchase. This information is particularly helpful for first-timers who are clueless about how to decide what you need to buy. (A bit less helpful for experienced parents who already know what they personally need.) More recommendations: for a hefty (over 500 pages) and comprehensive baby care manual for a very reasonable price is Gentle Baby Care by Pantley; a great first-aid handbook is Baby First Aid by Stoppard."
5,A Must Have for new parents,"I found this book to be extremely helpful. Being someone who researches EVERYTHING the daunting task of researching all of the different must haves for a new baby was made infinitely easier with this book. I found the vendor ratings to be extremely helpful as well as the ""basic"" registry in the back of the book. This book was MUCH more informative than the consumer reports baby book.Another helpful hint? Check out the consumer feedback on the amazon website on the products you're thinking about too. You'll get real Mom's and Dad's critiques of the products that they are already using."
2,"No so many ""bargains""","A quick note of criticism for this book which seems to get wonderful ratings from other readers: While the product descriptions included are informative, a majority of the recommendations are for expensive baby products. What I was hoping for were bargains, but the message of ""Baby Bargains"" is ultimately ""You get what you pay for"". While this may be true, most people don't need to buy a book to learn this lesson. I'm still searching for the ""bargains"" in this book that some other reviewers were raving about..."
4,Great resource for parents!,"I used this book during my pregnancy, and it was great! Lots of good information on what to buy and what not to bother with. I used this book to help inform most of my baby purchases, and I was pleased with almost all of them. The reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that the authors tend to lean towards the high end baby items....I believe their top recommended high chair was $170 or so. (I ended up perfectly delighted with my $50 high chair.) However, they do make an effort to be sensitive to all budgets, and generally have recommendations in all price ranges. As an avid web shopper, I loved all the websites that were listed. Overall, it saved me a lot of money and really helped me navigate the baby superstore jungle!"
2,I realize I'm in the minority here...,"I thought I would weigh in, since all the reviews here are glowing. I expected to find this book helpful (Bridal Bargains by the same authors was excellent), but for several reasons, this book was a waste of my money. We live in a big city without a car, so the car seat discussion was not helpful; we co-sleep with our baby so we didn't buy a crib; we are using cloth diapers and so sections on diapers and diaper pails (the company provides this) weren't relevant either; etc. It was depressing, reading all the sections on expensive must-haves, when really you *don't* need to buy so much for your baby. The authors give advice on ways to save money (mostly by buying quality items that will last, a no-brainer) but ultimately, you could just reject the notion that most of the items in here are necessary and be a lot happier.The sections I could have used help on, maternity clothing and baby announcements, were missing a lot of good sources."
3,"OK, but mostly just common sense","I found the reviews of products and manufacturers in this book to be the most helpful information. Most of the money-saving strategies were just common sense, and in my opinion, still tended to err on the side of excessive consumerism. However, paired with consumer reports, this is a good tool for finding things on line and understanding the differences among the hundreds of choices out there for parents."
2,NO CALORIES GIVEN FOR RECIPES : (,"This is a lovely book, with great pictures; however, no nutritional information is listed. It just seems to me that a ""Look Good, Feel Great Cookbook"" should at least list the number of calories per serving. How can I ""feel great"" trying one of the tasty-sounding recipes when I have no idea how many calories I will be putting in my body? ? ? Hey, Jenny: How 'bout a revised edition that gives the nutritional info we need?"
1,Very Disappointed,"I was disappointed in the recipe book. It did not give nutritional data on any of the recipes. She also called for 'white flour'. Healthy recipes usually call for whole wheat flour or some type grain flour. Eggs are a 'no-no', artificial eggs are much more healthy. Too much sugar in so many recipes. Just not the book I thought it would be ... not really 'healthful'.. in my opinion."
3,Ok.,Interesting storyline. I liked the story and how the author expalined preeclampsia. Nice romance novel and I will be looking for more works by this author
3,Good...,This is a good romance book. I like the tale and the situtaion between the characters. But you can kind of guess what is going to happen next and that can ruin a book. I do like this book although you may figure out what is about to occur.
5,Apple Works 6 for Dummies,Just switched from MSFT. Great for spreadsheets and other questions.Better than Apple Works 6 The Missing Manual which I bought at same time.
4,DUMMIES FOR DUMMIES,"This book really is for dummies. It explains Appleworks 6 well, and if you're new to Appleworks in general or if you are only familiar with Appleworks 5, this is definitely the book for you."
1,Disappointment,"Very little of this book involves a cultural history of the USA in the 1910 decade. It is almost entirely a short book about politics. The politics is the simple minded ""progressivism"" that ended in the 1970'sType of book that Dan Rather or Jimmy Carter would enjoy."
3,You May Already Be A Weiner,"I've often thought about buying this item. However, I stop when I remember that my Imperia Pasta Machine already came with a Fettuccine and Spaghetti double cutter.I suppose everyone's may not have come with a cutter, despite it being included in the box. However, consider that you may already own one or both of the sizes/varieties being sold here.Of course you may not even realize that you have it because the documentation for the machine and cutters is poor or non-existant. At best, the cutter box has a hand-checked box that defines what cutter is in the box. I had to search through my order history just to make sure I already had the fettuccine cutter because the box for the pasta machine (and included double cutter) has no indication of what size/type is in the box.I dunno... I guess I expect too much."
5,Excellent Wax!,I have been using the Meguiar's NXT wax for years. A few friends recommended this product and I am very satisfied! No need to spend the extra $$$ on NXT.
1,Save your money and use google,"Bought this book to try to learn more about the multiple oppressions that may be in existence. The written style is very amateur, not at all professional or engaging. Did not learn anything new that I could not have found on google."
2,"After light use, the thermostat no longer works","I have had the Liddle Griddle for about 2 and 1/2 years and used it only about 20 times. I liked it at first, but after about 10 uses, the thermostat no longer worked properly and the griddle would seriously overheat in a matter of a few minutes. Since the year warranty had already expired, I could not return it. I never exposed the electrical parts to water, so that is not the cause. I like the size for just one or two people and it is easy to clean because of its small size. I have had an electric skillet and a large electric griddle and neither have ever overheated after years of use. I am reluctant to try my luck again on another Liddle Griddle."
3,Almost worth the money,"I travelled from Florida to Georgia with this in a suitcase and one of the handles broke off before I made it to my hotel room. Also, when I got to the local grocery store, they were selling one with a larger cooking surface for ten dollars less. So much for shopping online!Still, it did cook eggs and quesadillas just fine."
4,Nice little griddle,"I purchased this griddle to make small batches of tortillas, and it's working out well. The griddle is just large enough to cook two tortillas and they come out very nicely. Inexpensive and quality griddle. Well worth the money."
4,Great!,"I am very pleased with this unit. Very effective, easy to clean and take up little space. I recommend it."
5,Presto Liddle Griddle,"Perfect griddle for one or two people or a small family. Easily stored, doesn't take up much space. I love to cook bacon on this, it's fast, easy clean-up and the grease drains off. Definitely a 5 star product!!"
5,great little griddle from Amazon,This little griddle is what I have been looking for. It is small and very adequate for me. One major thing is that it works very well. Just love it.
5,liddle griddle gift,I purchased this for my mother-in-law when she saw mine. She loves it. Says it is just right for her and her husband.
3,Works for what i need,"Griddle it self is of good quality, fits my small cabnet top, easy to clean. Now the reason for 3 and not 5 stars, Like all Presto appleances as of the last 5 or more years the thermostat is way off. Example: set it at 300 degrees and may not cut off until 350 and then back on to 250, next time maybe 325 off and 275 on. Also where the Thermostat plugs in is a no heating zone, does not get hot at all right over that section so it is useless which on this small grill accounts for about 1/4 of it. Is easy tio clean. So if you have to have a small griddle go ahaed But do subtract about 25% of the cooking area away and the temp was checked with an infared surface thermometer so i know what the temps. where."
5,liddle griddle,I RATE THIS ITEM 5 STAR. I HAVE HAD ONE FOR FIVE YEARS AND USE IT EVERYDAY. A FRIEND WANTED ONE SO I ORDERED HER ONE PLUS ANOTHER ONE FOR MYSELF. FOR SMALL MEALS ESPECIALLY BREAKFAST IT IS GREAT.IT COOKS ITEMS VERY GOOD AND LITTLE CLEANUP REQUIRED.
4,A delight to use,"For a single person or a couple, this is nearly perfect. Just enough room for easy use but not so large as to be cumbersome or hard to store. Easy clean surface is just that."
5,Great Griddle for two,I have purchased 5 of these as gifts and everyone loves them. Easy to clean and takes up very little space.Perfect for two people.
5,I couldn't put it down!,"I found this book very interesting to read as it chronicled Becki and Keith's struggle to have children, then their struggle to care for them. As a person who looks after triplets, I cannot imagine what a job it is to look after six! When reading this book it is obvious that Becki and Keith enjoy their roles tremendously, and by looking at the photos of their beautiful children, it's easy to understand why. I highly recommend this book as an inspiring read that will restore your faith in family."
3,Confusing but somewhat informative,"I am a long time Artist fan and was quite disappointed in this book. The majority of the book is written in a very jumbled and confusing sytle. The author jumps from one thing to the next. She did include a few interesting items, but for the most part it has been told before. For someone who begins the book off with her long awaited interview with the Artist, she dosen't have many quotes or insights from him. She instead relies heavily on quotes and outtakes from others. I did enjoy the discography at the end of the book and the photos were good also. Overall I was disappointed in this."
2,UNAUTHORIZED BIOGRAPHY,"Been a fan for quite sometime and this book has its good points, however, the layout can lead your mind astray. For all of you REAL TAFKAP fans, if you look through all of your old magazines, you will see where this author gets most of her information. The passages about Funk and the Minneapolis sound, held my interest for a while. Didn't expect trashy accounts of his past life. His life was about the music and the music was about his life. I'm almost certain that we will one day get the real deal from the MASTER himself. Welcome to the Dawn !"
3,A summary of other people's interviews,"Several interviews rolled into one book. It was an ""ok"" read, that's why I gave it three stars. For a longtime Prince fan, there will be nothing new here. Mostly quotes from bandmates from other interviews. It's nice to have the discography in the back, but note that it only contains released material. Nice set of pictures in the middle. Storyline ends in the late 90's."
3,The book has useful info but Jones' writing is not very good,"This book provides some good information about Prince's background and working relationships. It is clear that Jones did a lot of research. However, the book lacks organization and focus, and haphazardly shifts subjects and eras. There is no chronological order to the book. That's where I find it lacking.A better selection, albeit rather old, is Dave Hill's ""Prince: A Pop Life."""
1,"Instead of this book, buy Per Nilsen's DanceMusicSexRomance","After reading this book, I wonder if Ms. Jones has to pay any penalties for ripping off other people who interviewed Prince and didn't give credit. She made it sound as though she was interviewing Prince even though there are direct quotes from other interviews made by others. Incredibly tacky! If you want to know more about Prince, read Per Nilsen's book ""DanceMusicSexRomance."" Even though it only works up to the end of 1987, it is absolutely incredible. Stay away from ""Purple Reign."" I felt truly ripped off."
4,An intelligent review of Prince/O(+> career.,"This is not a trashy tell all biography of Prince's life, but rather a book that uses quotes from the man himself as well as articles and interviews with former band members and management to present an intelligent, informative look into the world of Prince/O(+>. Although much of the information presented here is common knowledge to diehard fans, it is still fascinating to read about the evolution of ""black"" music, funk, and the Minneapolis sound as it relates to Prince's music. This is definitely a must-read if you are new to the jams and want to get a handle on what the addiction is. Excellent discography and reviews of all commercial releases up to Emanicipation."
2,VERY AVERAGE,COMPARED TO PER NILSEN'S DANCEMUSICSEXROMANCE this is Worthy of The Star MAGIZINE.very ORdinary.THe Family Picture is the only New thing Of Interest.She Doesn't Explore THe MAN's Music Enough For Me.That's All that Really Matters In THe End.She Should Have Said More About the Music what She Liked or Didn't.It's very UNFocused.More Tabloid than SUbstance.
2,"informative, if you don't know any better","As a long time listener and follower of the ""Artists"". I was really surprised at the second hand information and the many reaccounts from old and dated news articles. I believe if the author had full cooperation of Paisley Park, she would have concentrated on the subject. Not the perceptions of other people. There is nothing that get's into the psyche of such a gifted man. Like or dislike him, you must respect the gift he has been given."
2,"Sufficient information, but writing quality is VERY poor","I was disapointed in the book from the very beginning. Although there was a lot of information about the artist himself and the music industry, the writing style was that of an eight grader. She jumps from subject to subject, not even in chronoligical order. It appeared that she got more information from magazines and television rather than from her ""long awaited"" interview. She talks about so many people like we've known them for years. She adds a lot of, what seems like, inside joke humor. Unless you've worked with The Artist, you would have no idea what she's talking about. All in all, if you would like lot's of information on The Artist, read the book. But be prepared for being confused."
2,A rehash of interviews already given.,"If you are a huge fan of the Artist, do not rush out and buy this book. The majority of this book is a rehash of interviews, print and television, that the Artist has already given. There is little dirt and inside info. Most of the information in this book is already known. Next book about the Artist that I buy will hopefully be his autobiography."
3,GOT THAT WEST-COAST SOUND....,"THIS CD IS OUT OF ATLANTA, BUT IT REALLY SOUNDS WEST-COAST GANGSTA (EARLY 90'S )CD IS FOR FANS OF CPO, WC AND THE MAAD CIRCLE, KING TEE, MC REN, GETO BOYS,HOUSTON RAP, ETC......CHECK IT OUT..."
3,It's just alright,"The watch works fine and looks acceptable (for what it costs), but there are a couple things they don't tell you that I wish they had. The watch is thick & heavy, measuring as much as a 1/2 inch from your wrist, which in my opinion makes it a little clunky and awkward. The numbers (black-face LCD) are also a little difficult to read in normal light. The band is thick rubber and is just as wide as the watch over its entire length. Knowing what I know now, I probably would not have purchased this watch in favor of perhaps a Nike or even a Timex, but now that I have it, it serves my purposes; a ""play"" watch that looks semi-stylish but that I'm not afraid to beat up."
5,Nexus of Objectivity and Subjectivity,"The aspect of Kripal's book that I enjoyed the most was seeing the realities of the academic pursuit. These various scholars of mysticism, by virtue of the very nature of academic engagement with the material, were working at the point of convergence of objectivity and subjectivity. And it is this placement at the nexus that invigorated and enlived their research.If one is interested in mysticism, or religious studies, this is an excellent book to read in order to get a glimpse of true scholars at work."
5,Thane's Best!,"I think her fans would agree that Thane's story telling seems always marked by a certain timelessness. In my opinion, this book, perhaps more than all her others, captures that quality. To start with, it is the Indiana Jones of its time - in short, a truly great adventure. And, as with many female characters in the Williamsburg novels, this heroine's feelings and thoughts are written so poignantly that the reader instantly identifies with her, regardless of era and culture. And, as always, Thane manages to weave an amazing love story into the story's fabric, along with everything else. It really is a great novel - one of my favorites. Read it -you won't be disappointed!"
2,Not up to par,"Thane's Williamsburg novels--particularly the first three--are delightful. Riders of the Wind, however, is a muddle of shoddy mythology and romanticized Anglo-Indian relations. It gets two stars only because its sequel, Cloth of Gold, was so mindless."
1,I cant belive i bought it,I Bought This Gun And It arrived In 3 Days. I Loaded 12 BBs Like It said and when i cocked the gun it jammed 2 bbs in instead of one. But when it does work it shoots like 5FPS instead of 200. I do not reccomed this gun in wars for it jamms ans takes a long time to unjamm.
1,*please read* :(,i bought 2 of these. the bullets and clips constantly fell out and it seems like 50 FPS (feet per second) which stinks!!!!!!!do _noooot_ buy this item!
4,mixed feelings,"honestly, this book is a bit dry. i use it for a Early Education Development class and i think it's more of a sociology book. it gets a bit repetitive and basically explains what is expected from the title. it just continually goes back to mention that after all the information given about different cultures, the importance of a caregiver being aware of social differences and emphasizes cultural competence when dealing with a child and their family. above all, this book is truly informational, especially from chapters 4 through 9 i think, when it gives a chapters worth of history each on different ethnic groups (african american, anglo-saxon/european, native american, latino, etc.). i suggest using this book for a sociology class or any class that deals with understanding different cultures."
2,Cheap mixer,You get what you pay for. Not the best hand mixer but works ok. I had a really nice one before and it broke so I figure I would try this. It's ok for whipping cream and easy things so for that its a good buy.
1,It was nice for 3 months,I bought this because I like to bake a lot at school for different clubs and events. It worked great even thought it heated up a bit too easily. Well after three months it completely died after I was making Nutella cookies. I could not believe it because it just overheated so easily. The worst part was I paid retail price for it. Now I need to buy a new one for the fall that is a lot better. If you want a mixer to last longer than three months then don't buy this one. It's not very powerful at all.
1,Not worth 15 cents!,"Bought this mixer for 15 dollars at a local Duane Reade store. First time I used it to mix a cake batter, it slowed down, sputtered, and died. The motor has burnt out and it won't ever recover. Thanks for taking my 15 dollars, Proctor Silex!"
3,"Proctor Silex ""EASY MIX""","For those times you don't want to lug out the big stand mixer for an ""Easy Mix"" (boxed items, etc.) this is light and handy and does the ""easy mix"" jobs efficiently. Something thick, yes, it gets slower, and if it struggles with your job, quit while you are ahead before you burn it up!!! I have had mine for more than ten years. Works for me.But I don't try to use it for everything."
2,Rusty Beaters?,"I received this a shower gift a few years ago. Standard mixer, can't do anything too drastic with it, but I noticed the last time I took the beaters out of the dishwasher they had rusted. These are not stainless beaters and they will rust. I'm in the market for a new mixer."
4,A mixer,"Needed a mixer for holiday baking because my old one broke. Does the job and arrived when needed. No bells or whistles, nothing fancy. But it does what it is supposed to do - mix."
1,Higher speeds burned out in light-duty job,We bought this mixer about a year ago. We use it about once a week to make whipped cream. We have never pushed it with any tough mixing jobs and we've always treated it gently. So far it has worked fine.Today the top two speeds (4 and 5) stopped working. There must be a loose connection somewhere inside. I'd recommend spending more and buying a durable mixer with positive reviews from long-term owners who do serious work with their mixer. This is a waste of money.
4,Light weight but works well.,"I bought a new kitchenaid brand hand mixer and it wouldn't get lumps out of cake mixes and other things. I guess it is because of the new prong beater style. So I wanted to find a mixer with the standard kind of beats. I found this one. I like this hand mixer because it is light weight and mixes better than the kitchenaid one. Not sure if would stand up to alot of mixing over and over again, but for a cake or something every now and then it works great. I may be wrong. I also purchased the Proctor Silex 62535 hand mixer to see what the difference and that one is also light weight and seems very powerful. I like the 62535 hand mixer better but am keeping both so I have a back up. I think the 62515 would be good for older adults and people like me that can't lift heavy things do to an illness or disease."
1,Fire Hazard,This mixer just caught on fire in our kitchen. Flames were coming out the back of it. I would avoid at all costs.
5,Mixer for Cheap Price and works like a Charm!,"Hi from Texas where the last hand held mixer lasted 20 years. It was held by Hand and simple and washed up easy.No more fancy do it all mixers that do everything including painting the car??? Too much trouble to clean and store those fancy high priced things!!!!!!!!!!!!!!These are simple, cheap and buy two and when one croaks, dig out the replacement and keep on Blending those Cookies!Ron in Texas for my wife of 54 years. August 15, 2012 2 p.m."
4,Works ok for the money,"I bought this mixer for a rental house we own. I wouldn't say it's the best mixer, but its the best one for the price. We rent the house out weekly so I think this is ok for a quick mix of brownies, not sure I would buy this for my own kitchen."
4,Good for the price,You get what you expect for the price. It doesn't feel solid and slows down when the going gets tough but works well for a small kitchen and for people that aren't cooking for more than 4.
2,Not very impressive,"I thought the drying rack was pretty poorly made from really cheap wood. The thing reminded me of something you would make in woodshop in junior high school. Maybe that's why the reviewer ""Dennis"" likes this rack so much...it reminds him of his rare school accomplishments. The rack is nice looking but considering the price, it is no bargain. The wood splits on assembly because it is of poor quality. I liked the way it looked, but as for it being functional and sturdy, I would say other products would do better."
5,What a great addition to pasta making,"I love this rack, before had noodles spread all over dining room table. Now their on the counter, dry in no time, neat and clean. If you make pasta this is the rack to get."
2,"Barely adequate, very inconvenient","Previous reviews say it well. This is simply to confirm:- difficult to store- very cheaply made- requires assembly- not worth the money at any priceAlso, it's not very tall. Perhaps I just stink at making pasta, but my pasta was entirely too long when compared to the height of the rack."
3,Not a bad rack,"The good stuff:-Has LOTS of pasta drying space.-Dowels come off for easy manuevering of pasta.-I find it to be attractive, but I like simple wooden thingsThe bad stuff:-Difficult to store, it doesn't fold on its own-Difficult to take apart, the screws on mine were stripped-A little flimsyOverall, not a bad buy for the price - but there are better racks out there!"
1,not well engineered,"My rack came with pieces warped, one screw and most screw holes missing. Wood split as I was putting it together. Used it once for drying pasta, then once for kindling. Hope you have better luck."
1,"As many people in the world I got ""Memory Stick Error"" (C:13:01) on my Sony DSC-W5)","Please be carefull, this is not a lie, lot's of people are having problems whit this memory.""Memory Stick Error"" (C:13:01) on my Sony DSC-W5) rises 1 month after I bought this camera, then suddenly It works again, but I'm expecting to have this problem again. My advice: do not buy it, at least until a new corrected version become available."
4,Right purchase,"I appreciate the Amazon'suggestion, when I bougth the camera Sony, they showed this memory stick and the price was very attractive respect other brands likewise the performance is satisfactory."
1,Crapola Disk,I have this disk and am yet another victim of the C1301 Error. Is anyone filing a class action lawsuit against SanDisk? I would like to be party to that!
2,Good Price Risky Buy,"When I started to buy Sandisk, I buyed ""normal"" Memory Sticks. As time passes I don't get any problem with them (five 128 mb Sandisk memory Sticks). The next step was MS PRO, so I buyed two sticks 256 and 512 MB. Unfortunately I got a ""Memory Stick Error"" (C:13:01) on my Sony DSC-P150, with the 256 mb memory stick pro and it became useless, so beware with this cheap buy."
5,"Disneyland, here we come!!!","Got this in time for our vacation, and we're really looking forward to using to take lots of pictures. This product can hold hundreds of your favorite images, as well as take video, if your camera has that function.Highly recommended!MC White said: Muy a'iiiiight!"
4,Best Buy Best Price,Kudos to amazon - I searched ebay - shop.com and other comparison searches - only amazon came up with what I wanted at a price I could afford - only downside to this order -- I didn't receive the package as quickly as I was led to believe.Thanks amazon!
1,Memory Stick Error,Purchased it for a Sony DSCP150 camera. It started giving me random memory access errors. I talked to Sony support and they said they only support Sony memory.
1,does not work with P900,"this product is marketed as the equivolent to the sony ""pro duo"" cards (at least that is the impression i gained from the web site) but it definately did not fit in my p900 phone at the sony pro duo cards do..."
3,Great Product --- On its way out,MemoryStick is a great product...however make sure you purchase the DUO smaller model if you plan on using this in any newer Sony products as many of them will not take this larger version.
1,Overweight...overpriced...1970's technology,"With a halogen or possibly xenon bulb (that is only meant to last 30 hours), and even with 8 (EIGHT!) D cell batteries to power this unit and weigh it down, I've found other handheld ""LED"" spotlights on Amazon (needing just a couple of 'AA' batteries) for 1/5 the price, that provide more 'spotlight' power than this KingLite unit. I even have a 'zoom' LED flashlight for under $10 that, in the spot mode' gives MUCH more light than this KingLite."
1,BAD product,"After much investigation this seemed like the perfect toaster oven and initially it delivered -- good size, good functions etc. However after two months it stopped working. Looks like Black & Decker still haven't learned how to make a decent product."
1,Unit was not capatible,I gave and verified the correct unit model number to work for my Nextar GPS and the AC adapter looked right but would not charge because the amps did not match. Charger was useless and I was out $I guess thats what happens when you purchase over the internet.
5,Excellent product!,Great product and we are enjoying it! Easy to install...only problem we had was it took a very long time to get it! The item got trapped in Atlanta during the ice storm and it was delayed over a week!
3,wild popcorn maker,Well it takes a little time to actually produce enough heat to pop kernels. In the meantime kernels fly out the front. Also when corn is popping it goes all over the place. other then that works great .
4,poplite corn popper,it works well but some stray kernels spit out prematurely-which are very hot.i like the low-cal popcorn it makes.
2,No ON/OFF button!,"I am not sure I can trust a company that saves 20 cents on a power switch. If you need to turn it off in a hurry, and the power cord is hidden behind something, it might take a few unnecessary seconds. If you want to make two batches, you will have to plug it in, make one, plug it out, you get the idea..If you prefer not to have power switches, and spend your time with electrical outlets, all the power to you (pun intended). But for me, this goes right back. Electrical appliances should have power switches in convenient locations. Period."
1,Presto 04820 PopLite Hot Air Corn Popper,USED LESS THAN 5 Minutes. QUIT.NOT WORTH THE COST IT'LL TAKE TO RETURN.
1,Problems with Presto popcorn popper,The Presto popcorn popper:Leaves too many of the seeds still unpopped.Blows popcorn beyond our big bowl onto the floor.
2,hot air popper,"I guess this is the best that I could get for the price.My old Wearever hot air popper gave out after 20+ years of great service. I guess I was spoiled.Why do the kernals spit out right from the start? I asked customer service at Presto and they told me I must fill the 1/2 cup up fully or there isn't enough ""weight"" to keep the kernals in the machine. It really doesn't make sense or matter because they still come spitting out right from the initial plug in. Additionally, the kernals seem to burn very fast.That I don't get either.Like usual, the old machines were made much better than the new crappy ones. But what can you do except just go along. No other choice really."
5,Great air popper for healthy popcorn,"I am on a restricted diet, this popper allows me to enjoy the popcorn without adding oil. It works great. Could not find it in any stores in my town, but you had it."
4,hot air popper,My old hot air popper hit the dust after about 20 years of a lot of use. Hope this gives me the same kind of service. My only complaint is the upper portion of the popper gets hotter than I would like. Otherwise its a winner.
3,Popcorn Poppers are a crap shoot anymore,"Although this product was the best rated, I can see it is a gamble as to wheather you get a good one or marginal one. I saw this same issue with toasters. My unit does get very hot, but it pops pretty good. Quite a few old maids though."
1,Fire Hazard! Do Not Buy,"After about two dozen or so uses, I plugged in the popper yesterday and it blew out in a puff of terrible smelling smoke. Electrical smoke, not burnt popcorn smoke. This happened as soon as I plugged it in.. within seconds, it shut off and it was smoking. An awful smell, I put it outside until it cooled down.I sang the praises of this popcorn maker when I first bought it, as I was trying to replace a 20 year old unit (wow, I wish I had one of those oldies right now).While this popper worked fine for those two dozen uses, I don't advise anyone buy this machine because it might be working well one day, but you never know when it could possibly start a fire. I'm glad I was standing right there when this happened.This unit is cheaply made and dangerous, in my opinion. If only I could find a good and SAFE popcorn popper. I guess it's back to the hunt.Thanks!"
3,"Okay product - nothing special, nothing awful","We always popped popcorn on the stove with a regular cooking pot, but were tired of the mess that the heated oil and melted butter left behind on the stove and nearby cupboard.This airpopper was very reasonably priced, so we gave it a try. It does the job, but we have a few things we don't like:1. When the kernals are bouncing around and heating up, about one to two dozen of the hot kernals bounce right out of the popper (and we only put in half of the maximum amount of kernals!)2. The butter tray does a very inadequate job of melting the butter.3. The popcorn is 'chewier' than the way we were popping popcorn on the stove.Overall, it works fine, but I don't think I'd recommend it to others."
4,"Excellent no-fat popcorn, missing an ON/OFF switch",Pros:Pops most kernels.Easy to use and clean.Cons:No ON/OFF switch.Very short power cord.
5,Presto PopLite,Have used one for over a decade - finally broke the still working original when it fell of a shelf & replaced with Amazon purchase. Consistently makes great popcorn with minimum unpopped kernels even using cheap store brand popping corn. very easy to use & clean & nearly as fast as microwave without any oil if you want low fat snack.
4,No Surprises,The best part of this experience was there were no surprises. The popper works well with a few shortcomings that I expected. Typically ejects a few popped and unpopped kernels during the popping process even thought I angle it at certain times to reduce the quantity. Don't mind having to unplug it since I have to to put it away.The very best part of it is there is essentially no cleanup. That I really like and why I use it more than my stovetop popper which makes better popcorn.
1,Fire hazard,"i wanted to love this product but it's just way too much hassle for something as simple as popcorn. first, this sucker shoots burning hot unpopped kernels across the kitchen. if that wasn't fun enough, when you try to unplug the thing to make these missiles stop firing, sparks fly from the socket. good times."
3,Pretty good overall,"I got this for an engineering project, and I think it works pretty well. It pops about the same amount as a bag popcorn.But no oil was used (kinda tasteless because of this). But you can add butter on top of it. The only down side is that it doesn't have a switch so that when you plug it in, it starts to pop. I got it at Wal Mart of $14.99, so conside it's price and all, it's a pretty good product."
1,Caution!!!! Poplite cord got too hot!,Please check your cord for getting heated; could be a hazard! Cord got too hot after a few months of use. Popcorn was dry; good feature for dieter but we consider safety first. We'd rate this with zero stars if we could due to considering safety first.
5,good,I have used this device and was truly fantastic in less than two minutes you have popcorn without oil and healthy
5,awesome,"Presto 04820 Pop Lite Hot Air Popper Popcorn popper is a convenient and healthy way of cooking popcorn without oil, however if you want to indulge in different kinds of buttery tasting popcorn you can always use the butter melter which is also the measuring cup for the popcorn kernel that is conveniently placed on top of the popper for easy access and use."
5,way better than microwave,good popper for the price. my kids love it and i'd rather them eat air popped than microwaved in oil.
5,Great Popper,Pops almost all of the kernels and quickly. First time I used it there was a hot plastic smell from the top heating up - which I anticipated from a new product. I tossed the first batch of popcorn just to be safe. No smell on the second batch. Overall great popper.
3,"overall good, but some less desirable factors","This popper works alright, but the first 30-45 seconds hot, unpopped kernels shoot out into the catch bowl. Also, the butter dish on top never gets warm enough to melt the butter, even at room temperature. Also, I don't like that you HAVE to make 1/2 cup of kernels or it doesn't pop properlly."
2,burned out,"Lasted about a year, then burned out, which was very disappointing, since it was a third popper in a row. The previous two ones were Presto Orville hot air corn poppers (both lasted also about a year). I do not think that we overloaded it, since after our previous bad experience we were very careful and followed the instructions closely. I liked the fat free popcorn option, so I was willing to give it a chance again and again, but I'm done. I can't keep replacing it so often. I wish there was a better alternative."
4,Worth the money.,Very good but quite a few kernels jump out of the popper into the bowl unpopped. Popper pops corn very quickly and none of the popcorn is burned.
4,great machine,works fantastic and very quick. I melt the butter in the microwave while its popping then add it when its done. It doesn't melt quick enough using the cup on the machine.
4,Nice Air Popper,"This works great for making popcorn without any oils. Sometimes in the beginning, a few of the kernals fly out before being popped, so I quickly put them back in for popping. You can choose to make a little or a lot at one time. Makes a great healthy snack :)"
4,LOVE IT - Except no off/on switch,"I forgot how wonderful popcorn tastes when not nuked or made with chemicals! Soft and creamy tasting from this popper!! We use only organic popcorn as well. Now, the bad news is why hasn't Presto made an on/off switch????? Us ""oldie's"" have a hard time reaching the outlet and............. the popper is hot and have to reach over it. So that is why a 4star instead of 5. We have used it about 7 times."
5,Works perfectly,This popper is very fast and effective. It does not leave many unpopped kearnels. Easy to use too and a great price from Amazon.
1,not happy,I ordered this product on dec 10 as an xmas gift and it still has not come. I tracked the package and it was supposed to be here on dec 15-17 and i also left feedback on the tracking page with no response.
5,Back for more,"we had a hot air popper when my kids were growing up and when my son moved out, so did the popper. I just had to get another one. the Presto PopLite hot air popper is light weight and very easy to use. Just measure the popcorn with the cup on top of the popper, replace cup and add butter to melt. plug in and watch the fun begin. it pops big fluffy kernels in no time at all. unplug when popping slows down to avoid unpopped kernels from flying out. ( only a few unpopped kernels remain.) Also, use a deep bowl and the popped corn will stay in the bowl, if you use a shallow bowl, some of the popped corn will over flow cause the kernels are so big. this machine is very easy to clean, just empty the unpopped kernels from the machine and wipe with a damp cloth, wash and dry the measuring cup and your done till next time, witch won't be long because this machine is so easy and fun to use and the popcorn is great!!!"
3,Mixed review,"This gadget popped every kernel but three, was fun to watch, but I didn't care for the popcorn texture. The popped corn was good looking, large and fluffy looking, but it was quite chewy and not crispy. Perhaps if you dried it out in a barely warm oven it would improve.It's going back. The Nordic Ware microwave popcorn maker produces better tasting popcorn. Also with the microwave popper you have the option of adding a minuscule amount of oil (1 tsp) which produces negligible fat, but improves the texture."
4,"good, not great","popcorn comes out, but it will also shoot out unpopped kernels and it'll shoot out a lot of them. be prepared with a large bowl to catch these torpedos."
4,"Healthier popcorn, easy, and holding up well!","All those things I mention. Air popped popcorn is much healthier. Very easy to use. No problems malfunctioning or burning the popcorn! Only drawback, the thing moves a bit so don't use it close to the edge of the countertop."
4,Fun & Healthy,"We switched to air popped popcorn to get away from the chemicals in microwave popcorn. We use the PopLite at least twice a week and have very few problems with it. Yes, some popcorn will shoot out past the bowl and an occasional hot kernal will escape, but that's a fair trade off for a healthy treat (in my opinion). We will frequently melt a small amount of real butter to drizzle over the popcorn (maybe a tablespoon?) and sprinkle with kosher salt. It tastes great! We enjoy this so much that it's hard to eat movie theater popcorn now....it just tastes gross and full of preservatives."
1,very short lifespan,This product has a very short life as motor burned out (just stopped) after a dozen or so uses over a couple months.
4,Good machine.,Does a very good job of popping popcorn without adding butter or grease. Would be even better if it had an on/off switch.
2,Disappointed in product,"I purchased this air popper after mine of 30 years finally started to wear out. Whereas my old popper popped the kernels and there was enough air to force the kernels up and out of the plastic hood, this Presto lacks enough force to keep the popped corn coming up and out of the chute adequately. The popped corn tends to build up in the shaft and I find myself tilting the unit forward to try and encourage the popped kernels to spill out of the chute. I am disappointed in this product and would definitely not recommend it."
4,only used once so far,"seemed to work great, only negative (and its a small one) it doesn't have a power switch. also need a large bowl to catch popcorn"
3,Okay,Okay for the price. Would be nice if it had a on and off switch. Could also be a wee bit quieter
5,excellent,"This is a great way to have a fat free snack. This popper is very fast and there is no cleaning involved. You have to follow the directions carefully and not put in too much so it does not overheat. Ohter than that, it is fantastic."
5,PRESTO & IT THE POPCORN IS READY TO EAT,"I recently purchased the Presto PopLite Hot Air Corn Popper online via AMAZON.com for my husband's Father's Day gift. He loves it! Fast and efficient, it pops most all of the kernels. Important to use fresh popcorn! He is enjoying his popcorn on a regular basis and the corn popper is doing a great job. It is very light weight, and easy to store. I love free shipping from AMAZON.COM. Makes the deal even better."
4,This popper works,"I got this hot air popper about 2 months ago. It works flawlessly so far. There is a small problem with un-popped kernels jumping out into the bowl, but very minor and I just plop the 1 or 2 back in.Important: get good quality popcorn or your experience won't be the best. It's worth the extra couple bucks....popcorn turns out more fluffy and tasty."
5,This is how a hot-air popper is supposed to work,"This popper works the way hot-air poppers used to work, before they started getting all fancy-looking with sloped popping chambers that throw out half the corn un-popped.As long as you follow the instructions and put exactly 1/2 cup of kernels in the thing, the corn pops up all fluffy, without any barely-popped toothbreakers hiding in the batch and with only a few ""old-maids."""
5,What an upgrade!,"We have been using an older popper that required oil and had hone of those little metal arms that spun around the bottom of the bowl while heating up the plate. While that still popped the popcorn fine, this new Presto Air Popper is leaps and bounds better. It is so easy to make a bowl of popcorn...Just add 1/2 cup to the hopper, plug in, and in a couple minutes, PRESTO! No oily mess to clean up, just a good rinse and you are done. Popcorn tastes great too."
3,Not bad for price,"This is a class popcorn maker. Worked great for about 2 years, then it literally started on fire (probably something caught in the heater?)."
3,Not what I'd hoped for...,"How I wish I were among those reviewers who were able to rave about this product! I was hoping to have found the Alpha and Omega of poppers. Rather, the Presto PopLite is merely...adequate, and just barely at that.Pros:It's quiet.It's fairly quick.The kernels that get popped are nice and fluffy (note foreshadowing).Cons:The hot air blows straight up, expelling a significant number of unpopped kernels throughout the popping cycle, particularly at the very beginning. I see this as a serious flaw, since it's supposed to, you know, pop the popcorn. I've tried popping cheapo generic, Orville R., and fancy purple popcorn, with the same result. I've also tried popping the fancy, smaller-kerneled corn, with the results being predictably disasterous.The popping chamber holds only a half cup at a time. My old popper ably popped twice that amount.In short, for those searching for that Holy Grail of hot air poppers, I'd say...keep looking!"
5,It does what it's supposed to do.,It pops corn quickly and efficiently. What else is there to say other than it's great.
5,Super Hot Air Popper!,Great product for the price! The only drawback was some unpopped kernals (which could have been the brand of popcorn) and the popped popcorn occasionally swirled outside the circumference of the bowl (and I used a very big wide bowl).
1,If you like dry tasteless popcorn...buy this!,My family makes popcorn two times per week. We have found the Whirley Pop with Peanut Oil to be the best combination for taste and minimizing extra un-popped seeds. We recently decided to explore a healthier alternative than using Peanut Oil so we converted to Oliver Oil. It works well and yields similar results. We purchased this air popper to see what it is like to eliminate the oil and found it to be terrible. It was like eating paper. Plus their were many un-popped seeds and many pieces flying out of the shoot and not landing in our oversized bowl. The air pop recommends that you melt butter to add to your popcorn. We tried it and came to the conclusion that we needed to add more butter (fat & calories) than needed when making popcorn with the Peanut or Olive oil.
2,This popper is a pain!,"I ordered this popper because of the price and the air-pop instead of oil feature. Unpopped kernels fly out of the opening and I have to hold the popper back at an angle to prevent so much of the kernels flying out. Also, there are too many kernels unpopped. I will keep it because of the price and the fact that I can get some popped popcorn out of it if I hold it right but I am not too happy with this popper."
2,Didn't work as I expected,"I followed the recommendation of another reviewer and let the popper heat up some before putting the corn in. Unfortunately, the airflow was so strong that half the kernels got blown out before they could get hot enough, so half the corn was left unpopped. Also, the plastic top part of the popper got too hot to handle. And, last but not least, the corn that did get popped were tough and chewy and tasted like cardboard.Overall I was not happy with my purchase and had to return the unit. Customer service was great. Too bad the popper wasn't. :("
2,doesn't melt the butter,"no on-off switch. huh?designed so badly that it does not melt butter.wish i could find an inexpensive, good replacement."
2,It wasn't good,We used it may be 20 times till it broke. The butter went inside of the whole and made the blower engine to burn.
2,like eating chewy cardboard,I thought I'd get healthy and try the air popper. The first time I fixed popcorn in this I thought the popcorn was old because it was so hard and chewy. So I went and brought some new popcorn and it still turned out chewy and stale. Not too mention I couldn't even get popcorn salt to stick to the popcorn. It was like eating cardboard but I think cardboard would have more flavor! So I went back to popping my popcorn in a heavy stainless steel pan on top of the stove in a little peanut oil and some popcorn seasoning oil and some popcorn salt added to it. Yum! Not that's popcorn!!!
1,Quit working after one use,"I will admit, the batch of popcorn I made the very first time I used this popper was excellent... light and fluffy popcorn, very few unpopped kernels. However, the second time I tried to use it, it only made a strange humming sound, would not blow any air, and started to smell like burning plastic. I quickly unplugged it, let it cool down, and threw it in the trash. I knew it was inexpensive when I bought it, but I didn't think it was CHEAP. Now I know better. Very disappointed."
5,Great popper.,"I'm surprised -- after trying many other brands and styles, grandma is the most satisfied with this one. I've not purchased this to by self but for grandma. Works great -- grandma's neighbor also asked for one, so I ended up getting two, both work great."
2,"Makes Great Popcorn, but...","The corn popper makes great popcorn, but I don't like that there is no on/off switch. When I plug it in, blue flame shoots out of the electrical outlet. The same happens when I unplug it. I don't know if it is dangerous or not, but I'm a little afraid to use this appliance. I'd hate to get electrocuted over popcorn. Also, it set off my smoke alarms, despite unplugging it the minute the popping was over."
1,Popcorn Blower not Popper,If you like about 40% of your popcorn kernels to pop into the bowl before they are popped then this is the machine for you. I got so aggravated with mine I threw it outside in the snow. As far as I'm concerned this machine should have never made it to manufacturing. It a piece of cr_p!
3,air popcorn popper,"After 22 years with my wedding gift popcorn popper waiting 3 minutes to heat before adding the corn, I am happy not to have to use up 3 minutes of electricity for the popper and my kitchen timer with my new air popper. However, warning: hot plastic, as in the top part, I have just learned, gives off toxins to your food. Unfortunately, this popper, like all others, has a plastic top which gets very hot. So although we eliminated the oil/fat by not popping in a pot, we added dangerous toxins from the plastic to our food. No way to be safe in this society. By the way, this popper spits out a dozen unpopped kernels before the popping actually starts."
2,cheap,Made very cheaply and popcorn goes everywhere when popping. Should of spent extra money for a better unit. I don't pop corn very often so I thought this would of been okay. Guess not.
2,it works but...,"well the corn certainly pops, so i guess the machine does its job BUT the resulting popcorn isnt crunchy and since it is cooked without any oils, salt WONT stick to it unless you pour melted butter over it, to me it's frustrating since i dont always want the big butter chunk on my popcorn"
5,poplite hot air corn popper,"Excellent popcorn popper. Speedy, efficient delivery. Pops all kernels leaving only one or two unpopped. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone searching for a hot air popper."
1,Disappointed!,"This popcorn popper was a real letdown! It does pop the corn and it looks delicious with almost every kernel being popped, but the popcorn itself is extremely chewy instead of the light fluffy popcorn I'd grown accustomed to from a microwave... it's truly disappointing! I've since put it away never to be used again and gone back to microwave popcorn again! Btw, I was using Orville Redenbacher's Gourmet Popcorn too, but I'll try another brand before it's forever exiled to the kitchen cabinet never to be seen again! Addtionally, as a Prime Member it took 8 days to actually receive it... Another disappointment!!!"
3,Worked great for a year then died,"For 20 bucks and free shipping from Amazon (along with other SSS items) you just can't go wrong on this popper! Basic, easy, plug and go! The popcorn except for two kernels popped and they were light and fluffy. It tasted great because all we had was the butter we added and nothing additional like cooking oil. Much better than making it in a kettle or a microwave and less fat also.We use Himalayan salt which has a clean flavor and it was super.People that complain about a few at the end popping out crazy, well use a big enough bowl and face it towards the sink and no prob.A+++!UPDATE: Died after a year of use. Called the company and they said we over filled it with popcorn but we didn't, we used the measuring cup. I know it was cheap but thought it would last a couple years. I might give it another try and put less popcorn in it next time?? I just haven't found anything better out there in an air popper so maybe they fixed this in the last year I hope."
4,Popcorn Maker,"I am a Camp Host in the Tillamook State Forest, and This Popcorn Machine made4 pounds of Popcorn for the Kids on Saturday Night. It works great. Once in awhile we had to let it cool down a bit, we just keep pouring popcorn in it formany batches. It would get 5 stars if it had a off/on switch, instead on haveing to unplug it.But it dose what I wanted it to do. Kids loved the Popcorn...Camp Host Kent"
3,Great value Simple design,This is the Orville Redenbacker popper in a different color. Inexpensive and pops near every kernel quickly and without jamming. An on/off switch would make this 5 stars.I bought 2 but unfortunately months later one stopped working.
4,"Cooks well, but needs power switch.","This is a great popcorn air-popper. It has never burned any popcorn for me and it makes quick work of a bowl of popcorn. It does have one flaw. It has no power switch, which means you have to plug/unplug the unit each time you use it (or get a remote switch).That said, I would still recommend it because of how well it cooks."
1,use once-plastic butter holder melted and cracked,i have had a hot air popper for many years and it needed to be replaced. the first time i used this with 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter in butter melter holder and by the time it was almost melted saw the upper plastic area had melted and cracked along with butter holder. not happy
5,BEST POPCORN POPPER!,My children love popcorn and they love this popcorn maker. It is easy to use and the easiest cleanup. It leaves only 1-3 kernels unpopped. Best purchase of the month.
3,I turn it on and the kernels fling out...,"It does a good job, but I have to hold the thing tilted back the whole time or the kernels just fling right out into the bowl the second I turn it on before they get the chance to pop. Aside from that, it does the job. I'm just using regular yellow kernels that worked fine with my old air popper before it broke."
5,for $20 you can't go wrong,Easy to use and cheap. This is exactly what I needed to address those afternoon cravings without reaching for fatty chips. Nice on a cold day!
5,Great Machine!,"We bought this machine a couple months ago. It works great! First of all, it's small and not to big, makes yummy popcorn fast, easy to clean up, and it's a lot of fun to watch pop, and you buy this for an AWESOME price, and much healthier than regular popped microwave popcorn.Warning: If you put too much popcorn past the mark in the popping chamber, it would ricochet all over the place.I totally recommend this popper if you like to have fun and have a sweet tooth!"
4,Excellent.,My only complaint is that there is no on / off switch. You have to use the plug to start and stop. Works great and does the job.
4,Very Good!,"I really enjoy this. I got it for my boyfriend for his birthday. It taste great and does pop everything but a couple kernels. Recommended to put a big bowl underneath, we lose some to the floor otherwise. We have found it can be dry and hard to put seasoning on it if you like that. Otherwise a great popper!"
1,popcorn is stale - don't buy,"Pros: super quick and easy to use (like most air-poppers).Cons: popcorn is stale/ not crisp and I know the kernels are good/fresh because when I make popcorn in a pan they are delicious (same results with fancier, gourmet kernels). Also, it always reeked of chemicals even after a year of use.Would not buy this again or recommend to a friend.Also, shipping box was shredded upon arrival."
2,"Look Mom, no on off switch!","I should have known when I saw the Ovil Redenbakker name on the label - had I seen that vastly over-advertised name, I would not have ordered it. And true to form, while it does pop, nowhere does it tell you that they were too cheap to design it with an ON/OFF switch. Using it means you have to plug and unplug it. B o r i n g. Sorry I wasted my money."
2,Not the best...,"I bought this popcorn maker because it was the only one I could afford at the time. I bought it last year, and I have only used it twice. I used to have another popcorn popper that I loved...this doesn't live up to that one. I wouldn't buy it again."
1,HORRIBLE!,My package arrived very quickly which i greatly appreciated. the package was packaged horribly. the box was all dented and the machine inside the other package was cracked due to improper packaging. very dissatisfied. and way over priced!
1,Not Too Good for Coffee Raosting,"I bought this popper to make roasted coffee, having used the Poppery II for many years for that purpose, with great success. However, I can't recommend this popper for that purpose.With the Presto, the hot air blows at the bottom of the bean chamber with such force that the green bean were flying out of the popper. I added more beans, which kept the air velocity down to the point where the beans stayed in the popper (more or less). The problem with this fix is that the beans in the air flow cooked in a flash, leaving the rest of the beans in the cooking chamber uncooked. I have been using a Poppery II for a few years and wanted to add another roaster to the stable so that roast day went a bit faster (roast one batch while cooling beans and loading the other). I'm going to locate another Poppery II. The only good news is that I can pop some popcorn with an air popper that isn't coated with roasted coffee oils."
2,Not good for roasting coffee beans,I purchased this popper because I wanted to try roasting coffee beans. I realized this was the wrong style of popcorn popper my first attempt at roasting the beans. This style of popper has the air vent at the bottom of the container instead of around the sides. Coffee beans went everywhere but a few did remain and roast. I have since purchased the other style with the side vents...works much better. I will use this popper for....POPCORN!
3,Christmas Present,Purchased as a christmas present and has not been used as yet. Did arrive fast and packaged good. Won't know how it works until after Christmas.
5,Awesome popcorn popper,"I bought this popcorn popper bc I was looking for a wholesome and no fat snack. Thats just what this popper does and more.Theres virtually no cleanup and it pops quickly using fresh popcorn not the box stuff with all the fat and additives.There are 2 cons though: this machine has no on off switch-just plug it in and it is dry popcorn, but what I do, is use the Spray coconut oil found at health food stores about $5 and the ""all natural"" Himalayan Sea Salt not the conventional processed sea salt that ain't good for ya.There is a little measuring cup you can use on the popper that will melt butter in while it pops the corn if you decide to go that route. Just remember if kids are involved the popper at time may throw out a HOT kernel, do not pick it up right away bc its HOT! I sent 2 of these as gifts during the Christmas season, can't go wrong! I love it!"
4,ok,it works fine... for this price its just great.... what I don't like is noice it makes... seriously it is to much noice...
5,Great gift!,Bought this for my husband as a birthday gift and he loves it! Works great and is so much healthier to eat popcorn!!
1,Had to return,I had to return this after one use. The cover melted. I was bummed that it melted my microwave/dishwasher safe plastic bowl. I was livid when I saw that the actual until itself had melted. Worst product ever! Please don't waste your money.
4,Poppin Corn..yeah,"Product came in a timely manner, and in one piece..very happy with had one of these many years ago, the kids love it"
2,Even at less than $15 if the popcorn is dry and lacks flavor is it a still a bargain?,I read many positive reviews about this popper and jumped at it hoping for a fresh healthy alternative to microwave or jiffy pop popcorn but we were sorely disappointed after tasting the 1st batch. It was extremely bland even after adding loads of salt which defeats the purpose. I used some melted butter which helped flavor but within minutes the popcorn was soggy...again not good. Popcorn also turned tough and hard to chew as it cooled. Not a good experience with this item.
3,The Popper works very well...but the popcorn is too bland,"Presto 04820 PopLite Hot Air Corn PopperI usually make popcorn the old fashioned way on the stove with popcorn seeds and oil, then I sprinkle some sea salt on for taste. I do not use microwave popcorn. I wanted to try something more healthy, so I went with this one since the reviews were so good. The machine works great at popping the corn, but the taste on the other hand is another thing. The popcorn is so bland, almost like eating pieces of cardboard. Even with sea salt and butter, I can't get my kids (or myself) to eat it. I wish that I could find another use for this machine, such as roasting seeds of some sort, but for now we would be making popcorn the old fashioned way."
2,tilting of the pop corn popper,I ordered this popcorn popper to replace my popped out popper. While the popper works the bottom metal plate was bent and causes the popper to tilt. I would recommend better wrapping.
1,THIS IS THE WORST POPCORN POPPER EVER!!!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS! The design is awful! When you pop the corn, 3/4 of it flies out of the popper before it even comes close to popping, due to the fact that the spout doesn't slope downwards enough. You will end up with unpopped kernels everywhere, which are very hot. This thing is cheap for a reason. I really have no idea why it has gotten such good reviews. I beg you: do not buy this!!!!"
1,What could go wrong?,"What could go wrong with an appliance that's just a heating element and a fan? Well, Presto has found a way.I got maybe 15 pops out of one I bought a year ago. I replaced it - identical model, fool that I am, but it was the only affordable popper on Amazon - and it got only one pop. I had to make it on the stove the old-fashioned way that nightThe popper I replaced about a year ago had worked about five years. It was a Presto, too. But one night it got over-enthusiastic and jumped off the kitchen counter. Shattered the lid, it did.We really like air-popped popcorn. Eat it maybe once a month. I guess I'll try a Discount Tommy's popper next. As for the Presto company: Watch me disappear - PRESTO!!!"
3,Popper throws hot kernels,"Popper does nice job of poping popcorn. However, safety concern with hot kernels flying out of machine and not landing in the bowl. If you have children you must make sure they are standing a safe distance from popper. I don't understand how these companies can make poppers that throw hot kernels on the market. FYI i did try other poppers and this one is better than others, but still a safety concern with hot kernels"
3,Decent for the price,"This popper is good for just that...popping. Although it claims there is minimal wasted kernels, about a handful of kernels are never popped and fly right out of the machine. Also, the butter melter on the top is worthless. Never fully melts the butter. Other than that it is a good product."
4,small disadvantage,"Overall I am glad with the Presto 04820 PopLite Hot Air Corn Popper. But there is a small disadvantage that applies to all hot air poppers. Since oil is not used, salt does not stick to popcorn. Then you shoud have an oil spray to aply before pouring salt. Then the advantage of hot air poppers not requiring oil is innocous"
5,"simple, effective popper","* Our old popper gave out after a couple of years of frequent use.* This one is inexpensive, simple, and works just fine."
2,Gack! Popcorn comes out chewy,Works as advertised. Very few unpopped kernels. But the popcorn comes out chewy. Possibly it doesn't get hot enough to drive off all the moisture? Returning this and looking for an oil-based popper instead.
4,Works great!,Works exactly as expected; the only thing that I would add is a metal tray to melt the butter faster.
4,Excellent Air popper,Excellent product for the cost. Although it doesn't pop every kernel it is easy to set up and use.
4,Great purchase,"This product is great. I've used it lots since I've got it and each time it makes great popcorn with very few unpopped kernals left over. I recommend to use white popping corn, as it makes a lighter and fluffier popcorn than yellow popping corn. I've had some issues with popped popcorn and some unpopped kernals flying out of the shoot when the machine is on. So be careful of that. Kernals come out quite hot!All in all, a great machine for the $$."
3,Presto 04820 PopLite Hot Air Corn Popper shoots popcorn everywhere,"I used to have a small. inexpensive model that shot popcorn through a smaller channel that left everything in the bowl. All the reviewers were correct about this one shooting popcorn everywhere due to the force of the popping and the width of the spout. But there isn't really a decent alternative, so just use a large bowl, put it on the kitchen counter and aim it toward the wall, guide it by keeping something at the sides or putting a kitchen towel over it while it is operating, and don't overfill the chamber."
4,"Cost Effective, Healthy Snacking","This is a great way to get a cheap, healthy snack.Just preheat the machine by plugging it in. Unplug it, and pour in your popcorn kernels. Let it go to work.Soon you have a great healthy snack. Top with flavoring, or butter if desired. I think it's perfect plain.I had one exactly like this growing up. Finally broke for my mom a couple years ago. So it lasted a good 15 years at least. Now I have my own."
1,Not for the long haul,"My trusty hot air popper died about a year ago after about 20 years of use. Since my old popper was no longer made, I looked for the next best thing and bought this one.It does not have an on/off switch like my old one, but that's hardly the end of the world. It popped more kernels into the bowl than my old popper but it was OK.What earned it a one star review is that the motor died after only a year. That's too flimsy.The popper that gave hot air poppers a good name is the Wearever Popcorn Pumper. That product is no longer manufactures but you can find it used on the web. I just got mine and wow! What a difference."
4,Works fine but watch for flying kernals at the end,"Echoing most of the other reviews here - it works great and makes fine popcorn, but at the end it will just spit out flying kernels all over the place."
5,"Good popcorn, easy to use",This product is easy to use and makes delicious air-popped pop-corn. It has really been efficient thus far and I would recommend this product to anyone.
4,good for an air popper,"This is good for an air popper but don't expect the same as oil popped. All air popped popcorn has a 'stale' texture to me but this is a good for those looking to eliminate the oil. Suggest spraying popcorn with pam butter spray before adding salt, etc. as the popcorn is very dry and does not hold."
2,DANGEROUS! Why is there no on/ off button?,"This item works fine, but if I knew that the only way to turn the machine on and off was with the plug, I would have bought something different. I don't enjoy seeing sparks of electricity fly every time I unplug this thing while it's still on. That's DANGEROUS!"
4,Great for Coffee Roasting Too,"I picked up one of these Presto poppers at a garage sale and have been using it to roast coffee beans for over a year. No problems, even considering I run the thing for up to 30 minutes at a time to roast multiple batches of beans. If it ever breaks, I will be buying another for sure."
5,"Love, Love, Love this popper!!!",I've had mine for a while now and tend to eat a good bit of popcorn.I've found that it works much better with white corn than it does with yellow corn...at least the brands I've tried....and am sticking with the white from Bob's Red Mill. I find perhaps five unpopped kernels with the BRM.
1,NOT BPA FREE Buyer Beware,I contacted the company and this item is NOT BPA free. It also does not pop a lot of the kernels. NOT BPA free it's not for me.
1,"NO ON-OFF SWITCH, BROKE 1st USE","I'm sure that most of these poppers last years, but the one I bought stopped working the first time I used it. Any company can make the occasional lemon, but how cheap is Presto that they don't even slap an on-off switch on their product. On the plus side, Amazon was fantastic with the return/refund. I've never had to return anything with Amazon, but they're great...they provide a return label, schedule the pick up and pay the shipping. Anyone who complains about customer service with Amazon is either lying or impossible to please."
1,Hot Air??? Really???,"We bought this popper, due to the good reviews it received. Opened it, popped the kernels, thought to myself, pretty outstanding!! Well, you get what you pay for maybe????? Used it two more times, then, on the third round, the top decided it was too hot and began to warp/melt.....a bit of a safety issue there maybe??? Amazon no longer carries, jeez, I wonder why??? Anyway, they refunded and I ordered it again, maybe it was just as defective lot??? We'll see what happens with the second one. If we have the same thing happen, then, we are done!!!! I'll be back with follow up!!"
4,"Great popper, just don't leave it unattended...","Works great. Much better than other poppers we tried, and cheaper too!Got in the habit of running it outside on the porch (all air poppers are very noisy!) but one day I let it run too long & the plastic outlet parts deformed...Still works, just have to keep an eye on it or it backs up."
1,Presto 04820 PopLite Hot Air Corn Popper,I purchased this air popper in December 2009. It blew up after 3 months. It just started smoking like crazy and then died. This is the biggest waste of money. Very disappointed!!!!!
1,What's going on with this?,"I ordered this popper within the last three weeks, and have made popcorn about six times. I started it today, and a splinter of flame came out where popcorn usually does. I unplugged the unit, and waited. When I started it again, the same thing happened. I found the directions, and called the company. A machine came on stating that they could not take calls right now. I e-mailed the company at the e-mail address provided. Twice it came back undeliverable. This is going to be a hassle.Before this moment, it was great."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought one of these to replace my old WearEver Popcorn Pumper (RIP). Boy what I would give to resurrect the old pumper!! The first problem is that this popper is built with the airflow straight up so it blows unpopped kernels out into the bowl. The second problem is that it has such low airflow (necessary due to the direction) that it doesn't get the popped kernels out into the bowl so they build up and scorch. Add to that the fact that, again due to the airflow direction, it pushes a large number of unpopped kernels out with the popped corn. Then add that the butter melting container is also the corn measuring cup, so you need to stop and wash it between every batch. The butter melting cup is plastic, instead of aluminum like the WearEver, so it doesn't have good heat conduction and won't melt butter that isn't already half melted.Overall, don't waste your money."
1,Motor caught on fire after only one month of use!,Buyer beware! I purchased this item for a family member a month ago and was just told he had to toss it out because the motor caught on fire! Definitely planning on contacting company.
1,Terrible product.,"Pros- Automatically feeds the dog, who's able to scavenge popcorn this thing throws everywhere but the bowl.- Some popcorn is edible and actually finds its way into the awaiting bowl.Cons1- Popcorn goes Everywhere floor, counter, sink, face of bystanders.2- Many Raw kernels ejected prior to popping.3- Yellow lid is flimsy, and does not attach securely to base.4- Popped corn frequently 'logjams', throwing the flimsy lid off and causing popcorn fountains (much to the delight of the aforementioned dog)5- Butter melting lid/bowl is useless.6- No off switch, so you constantly have to reach over counters and behind other counter-top appliances to plug/unplug this.7- Popcorn picks up a plastic taste. I do not believe they used a plastic that is up to the temperatures this thing reaches."
1,spits kernals and the plastic melts,I bought this Presto hot air popcorn maker based on the reviews. Big mistake. It spits out almost half of the small amount of kernels that can be added and overheats. The plastic top melted and twisted when the cap was replaced. It's disappointing.
3,"Great Popcorn Popper, but no on/off Switch","I really like how this gadget performs, Pops almost every kernel of corn.It gets a little wild at the end, I just hold my hand up so the projectiles don't shoot across the kitchen so no biggy.I would prefer that this appliance have a on/off switch.Sometimes I get an blue arc of electricity when I unplug it at the wall receptacle.All in all I am satisfied when my purchase."
4,"Good popper, bad melter",It pops all but a few kernels of the popcorn in 2.5 - 3.5 minutes. The cup on top is for melting some butter but it melts very slowly. If the butter was in the fridge at all then don't bother even trying to melt it with the popper. All in all it is a good popper.
3,It's OK but I personally do not enjoy it,"We really like salty buttered popcorn, but this machine is not be able to make it. It works great, does its job well, but that does not necessarily mean that we like the taste of popcorn. It is always so dry. Conventional way to make popcorn is always much better !!"
4,"Pops well, needs an on/off",Pros: Good job at popping pop corn. Does it quickly and effectively.Cons: No on/off switch. You have to plug and unplug the machine to turn it on/off. I question the life of the plug with repeated use and arcing.
4,Makes delicious popcorn,"This air popper works so well. It pops almost all of the kernels perfectly. There are always a few left in the bottom, but less than when you use microwave popcorn. I love how easy it is to make a healthy snack. Just pour the amount of kernels you want into the air popper and plug it in. The built-in measuring cup on top is very handy. My only complaint is that it's sometimes hard to clean out all the little pieces left at the bottom. Usually just turning it upside down over the trash can works, but I like to make sure everything is out before I put it away.This is a really good product for the price. I use mine quite a bit, so it was totally worth it."
3,It does its job,"I bought this popper because I'm supposed to be on a low fat, low salt diet. The popper does the job of popping the kernels - surprisingly, all except the final two or three. However, I've found that I dislike popcorn without butter and salt and I haven't found adequate substitutes for the taste I like. So, while this popper does a good job popping popcorn, just as it's advertised, it sits in my cupboard most of the time."
5,pops most kernals,This popper works best with a suitably sized receptacle underneath to contain escaping heat and with a towel lightly placed over.
5,Presto PopLite Hot Air Popper,"This is a very neat little popper. After the popcorn is popped, I spray it with Canola Spray and sprinkle Cardia Salt (which is a salt-tasting salt substitute that I purchase from Amazon) over the popped corn. I then enjoy a high fiber treat."
2,Don't waste your money!,"The quality of the popped corn is ok. However, getting to that point is annoying. It has no on/off switch, it is controlled by plugging in the unit. Before it reaches a temperature that starts the kernals to pop, the unpopped kernals are being spit out the tube and thrown all over the kitchen. If you have cats it keeps them entertained. The heat is not limited only to the inside of the unit, it radiates a lot of heat. If you're looking for an air popper I suggest you keep looking."
4,Love it,"Although some debri flies around a bit at first, this popper is soooo simple, and it definitely has less kernels in the bowl after it is done. If there were complaints it would be that there is no power button, and I am not sure why the design is to plug the cord in to turn the unit off and then to pull out the cord when you are done popping. In theory I guess that could be a safety hazard for keeping sure that the popper is not on and popping when you are asleep or not home, but most items have a power button and some sort of safety shut off.Still, WELL worth the money!"
5,Pop on!!,Been using it for over 3 months and still going strong. No problems and the price is great. Only wish it had a switch instead of having to unplug it.
5,my new favorite thing,"love love love airpopped corn and gave away my popper years ago when moving. i don'th ave a microwave, but when I did I used plain corn in a paper lunch bag.this popper is great, easy, and does the job well and quickly. YUM - with a spray of Trader Joe's olive oil spray and a good sprinkle of sea salt, I am a happy girl who is still watching her weight but loves to chomp on crunchy salty snacks."
5,The Best Way to spend your money,"I recently got a poplite and used for the first time and all I have to say is WOW!! Popcorn tastes so good without all that oil and salt. I can't think back to a time when I enjoyed popcorn this much. PLUS an added bonus this popcorn is good for you and it makes a great guilt free snack, and it is cheap, you can find popcorn a bargin stores for $.77 for 2lbs. That is a months worth of popcorn. So take it from me a popcorn lover, this is the only machine you need, throw the micriwave out and get this!!"
5,Hardly any unpoped kernals.,"This was a replacement for another air popper I got from Target that I had to repop the unpopped kernals 3 times to get most of them popped. With this one, I just tilt it backwards a little when it starts popping and this allows most of the kernals to pop with hardly any wasted."
4,Still the same popper,"This popcorn popper is very dependable. It would've gotten five stars, but it spits out a lot of unpopped kernels."
3,Engine burned out after a year or so,"Maybe it's to be expected for a $20 appliance. Ours worked great and then conked out. I should say that I think we are hexed when it comes to appliances. We've been through too many coffee makers to count, and don't get me started on the dishwasher. But when it worked it was swell. I'm replacing it with the Orville R. one, but who knows, there are no guarantees...."
4,Pops every kernel,"I had another brand popper that I did like equally until it broke. This is very good, however, I wish it had an on and off switch.It comes on when you plug it in and stops when you pull the plug."
3,Should be a 5 star But Plastic Melts Way To Fast,"I bought this popcorn popper based on reviews I read here on Amazon. On my first use it popped the corn great and I was very happy, until I saw the plastic was starting to melt on the top. It literally was starting to droop from melting. It was so hot I could not touch it for a few moments. So do not try and do two batches of popcorn back to back or you will not have a popcorn popper to pop a third batch. I still use this popper with the deformities and it does pop well. It would of gotten 5 Stars had it not melted."
5,air popper,"Great air popper! Happy with the purchase. does not leave any unpopped kernels. However, the butter melter is not great but that is only because the kernels pop so quickly there isn't time for the butter to melt!"
4,Presto Poplite Hot Air Corn Popper,"Bought it to replace a 20 year old air popper from J.C. Penney, it works just as well, though not as much per batch and we can only hope this one lasts as long !!"
4,Great Product,Makes great popcorn and my young boys love watching it pop! Only problem is that melting butter on the top doesn't happen as quickly as the popcorn pops so I just either melt the butter in the microwave or on the stove.
5,Works really well,"I had a hot air popper many years ago, and had thrown it away because I was using my microwave. I bought a new microwave and it wasn't doing such a great job popping corn, so I bought one of these. It works great! Very few unpopped kernels, and you can add oil and salt to your own taste. I use ""Pam"" to coat the popped corn with a light coat, and then I can use flavored popcorn salt to add a little zing.Read the tips from other reviewers about preheating and other operational suggestions. I'm very pleased with this purchase."
3,It's Just Okay,"It's just okay. The hood is rather flimsy compared to the one I had. It shoots a lots of kernels out before it starts popping. Yes, I know I can tilt it back until it has started seriously popping, but why should I need to do that. Also, if the hood gets off kilter once the popping has commenced, the hood is quite hot when you need to set it straight. This is once again due to the thin weight of the plastic."
4,solution for one conn to this popcorn popper.,"there are a couple of conns to this product in which were already discussed in the previous reviews. now this is a really good popcorn popper and I do like it, but the the problems it has are a little annoying.tilting the the machine and covering the funnel with a kitchen towel work perfect for the flying kernals. even though it's something you shouldn't have to do, it's not that big of a deal since it takes only a minute to pop the popcorn.however not having an on/off switch is. at first I thought it would go off automatically but it doesn't. I let it run way past after the the popcorn was popped. so I bought a single outlet with an on/off switch (make sure it handles the volts and wattage) that you plug into the wall, it cost $3.00. it would be a wise to do, I don't think it's to safe to unplug anything while it's still running."
4,Poplite works for me,Popcorn does tend to fly around buy you can position the bowl to catch it. Not using oil while popping corn is my reason for the purchase and it works great.
5,Presto PopLite Hot Air Corn Popper - yellow,"The popcorn is nice and fluffy without oil and calories. Popped corn fills the cavity and spills out into your bowl. The hot blowing air will toss the last remnants out, so unplug it. I use a wide brim bowl and have no stray missing the bowl."
5,Excelent,"I bouth the Poplite Hot air Corn Popper and went excelent> In my country there is other braind, but this is very good."
1,BURNS YOUR FINGERS!!!!,"This popper pops corn just as well as any other hot air popper, BUT the plastic lid gets as hot as a cast iron skillet. DO NOT attempt to remove the lid until it has cooled for at least 10 minutes, and do not let children make popcorn with this appliance. I used it once and blistered my fingertips."
1,1 batch only,"We have had this for a month and now it will only pop half a batch. We have used it under ten times and it is already breaking. Not sure what other options there are out there, but take them."
4,Good Popcorn popper,"Works well and efficiently. Just plug in and it'll pop on its own. The reason its a 4 star and not a 5 is because the top butter melting cup does not work very well. Luckily its microwavable and that'll melt any pieces of butter. Also, if you are only trying to pop a smaller bowl, a lot of kernels will come flying out without being popped. I'd say under 1/4 cup of kernels inside will lead to quite a few shooting out unpopped. Anything more pops greats, fluffy, popcorn."
4,FAST & FULL,THIS IS A FAST POPPER THAT ALSO FULLY BLOWS UP EACH AND EVERY KERNEL. AND THE LOAD CAPACITY IS ABOVE AVERAGE. THE ONLY DRAWBACK IS NO ON/OFF SWITCH.
1,Melting plastic.,"Makes wonderful popcorn, but after popping just one bowl, the shoot has melted into a deformed shape. The butter dish hardly fits in the opening anymore."
1,Fast but rubbery popcorn,Tried many different brands including organic. Popcorn came out tasting rubbery and stale. Went back to using our microwave and threw this thing away.
5,Hot Air pOPcoRN Popper,"-- The Presto Lite hot air popper purchased via Amazon.com cost less than a similar popper in local hardware store even after paying for shipping. Using hot air popper is safer than popping kernels in hot oil on stove. Hot air popcorn doesn't contain any additives. Consumers can add melted butter, salt, or other seasoning if desired. Popper is easy, quick, & fun to use. Kernels are inexpensive. --"
4,Typical Air Popper,I can't give it 5 stars because it does have issues mentioned in other reviews. They can be worked around. I have the Presto microwave popper also. I have to say that the microwave popper produces more moist popcorn. I use it more than this hot air popper because it pops a serving size that suits my needs. The price is great for this air popper. I do use it once in a while if I have the need for more volume in the case that I'm making it for more than one person. Just beware of the screamin' hot kernels that it can unpop out.
2,Makes tough tastless popcorn,"I really like how easy it is to use the popper. It's very fast and easy and I didn't have problems with kernels flying all over. However, I was so disappointed that the popcorn tasted awful. It was tough, I mean really tough, hard to chew and totally tastless. This one goes back. I did purchased the Pesto Microwave Popper. Even tho I didn't add any oil the popcorn was tender and delicious. What a difference."
1,Terrible,Popcorn kernals kept flying out of the hot air popper and popped kernals flew all around my kitchen. I returned the item.
1,You get what you pay for. Leason Lerned,"Product worked twice, and has stopped working. Waste of money and time, So disapointed I would give it no stars if possible."
2,Are you kidding me??,"This was the WORST shipping job I have ever seen in my life! ( and I shop online A LOT)! it was shipped it it's actual box only, nothing to protect it, so to no surprise the box is tore open! For the eight bucks they charge for shipping it was a joke! I'd rather pay more so they can spring for at least bubble wrap and masking tape! Just received it today so I have yet to see if it works. It would be a miracle if it does! We got it for a gift, I am embarrassed to give a box looking like this, so to avoid the hassle of returning and hoping I get the gift in time I'm heading to Target! Be wary ordering from here, unless u enjoy getting broken items in the mail. I'm giving it 2 stars on the chance it may work when I plug it in."
3,"No ""on/off"" switch!","I don't like the fact that it doesn't have an ""on/off"" switch. Otherwise, it's a nice popper. I'd rather have one with a built-in bowl, though. This one can get a tad messy towards the end of the popping cycle."
5,best popper I've found for years.....,Length:: 3:34 Minswatch it in action ....be patient as it takes about two minutes to heat up to pop. Then it pops a huge bowl in less than a minute!
4,Love it!,"We've had this unit for 6 months and we love it! We use it several times per week. The popcorn tends to get backed up in the chute and if not corrected, the remaining kernels have no where to go and burn. To fix that I just stick a chopstick under the clear chute (not down into the metal part of the unit!) and loosen the popcorn. They fall right out into the bowl and the rest of the kernels pop perfectly. This machine can pop a 1/2 cup of kernels at a time and we never end up with more than a dozen unpopped kernels in the bowl. And as long as we don't allow the chute to clog, there are never any burnt pieces. The last few pieces do fly onto my counter instead of the bowl but it is really only a few. It is loud but I only have to listen to it for 2 minutes so I don't mind. I would have given it 5 stars if it had an on/off switch. You plug it in to turn it on and unplug it to turn it off. I don't like the sparks that fly from my outlet when I do that!"
3,great with one giant drawback,"It's a good popper, but has no on/off switch. So, while it's madly spitting out the last hot kernals (into the air and onto the floor, instead of into the bowl) you're leaning in to yank the plug. How hard is it to make an on/off switch?"
1,This machine never popped one kernal.,I preheated. I measured. I timed. I tipped to 30 degrees and waited. I waited. I waited more than 5 minutes and NOTHING happened.The machine became a bit warm on the outside but never hot enough on the inside to pop anything.Nothing. Don't know when the fan is supposed to come on but it never did. This was brand new in box. I bought it myself at a big w store. At least I can return it.
2,Burns out easily,Pops popcorn great. Only problem is...we just bought it 2 months ago and it burned out. We had the same one before and it lasted about 3 months. Not sure why it does that. 2 in the last 6 months is ridiculous. We don't use it daily so it should last much longer.
4,Good product for price,"I bought this popper in order to make a healthier popcorn, one that doesn't require oil to pop. It pops the popcorn quickly and does a good job of popping all of the corn in the chamber. However, it does tend to shoot unpopped kernels out of the maker at the beginning of the popping process. Perhaps the chamber could be somewhat deeper. For the price though, it is a good alternative to popping corn in oil."
2,Go with a microwave popper..,"I purchased this because I have been eating popcorn daily, popped in a microwave popper by Nordicware.Compared to the microwave popper, this air popper made chewy/cardboard like popcorn. Not the fluffy, crunchy popcorn that the Nordicware makes (even without adding any oil or anything to the popcorn in either machine). The reason I tried the air popper was because it can make more popcorn at once.I will be returning the air popper, and will continue to use the Nordicware microwave popper."
4,Great air-popper,"This product does what it says it does. I think it pops the corn faster than a microwave, and much more fun because you can watch! Only one warning: don't put more than 1/2 cup of un-popped corn in at a time."
3,Pretty good popcorn popper,"Works fine if you employ some of the tricks others here have mentioned, like not putting the kernels in until it's heated up, or holding the butter melting cup up over the top a little until it gets going. The one thing I hate and wish they would redesign is no on-off switch. We had one like that before, but the new ones all seem to go on and off only by pulling the plug, which is pretty cheap and stupid. I do also wish the spout was designed to aim directly into a bowl that doesn't have to be the size of the Grand Canyon to keep the popped stuff from flying all over the room and on the floor, counter, etc. I thought we had a machine awhile ago (the one with the on/off switch) that had a better one than this."
2,Great until it burned out...,"Bought this in September 2010, and now after probably 20 uses and 10 months later it's dead. Like others, it nearly caught fire and had a burning smell upon entering its death throes.CAUTION: I think that what kills this obviously cheap product is putting too much popcorn into the unit.. it seems to be very unforgiving about this condition, and I think that may have contributed to the problem. Then again, could just be that it's plain flimsy and prone to dying. Going to go with a different brand for the replacement. Recommend avoiding this product."
2,Great if you like Chewy Popcorn,"Not as good as the reviews tell you. We were excited to receive this product and the popper works great in one department i.e., it pops all the kernels very quickly. A half cup unpopped kernels produces a large bowl of pop corn which is good. However, all the popcorn is extremely chewy. We tried 3 different brands of kernels include organic kernels but every batch was so chewy that it was in-edible for us. Moreover, once the corn pops, since this is air popped, there is no way to add salt or condiments that sticks to corn - hence resulting in bland chewy pop corn how much ever salt you try to add. An oil popper is better in this respect since salt and condiments can stick and pop corn is much crispier. We gave up and ended up returning it."
4,Presto 04820 PopLite Popper review,"I like the popper. It is convenient, and very easy to use. Popcorn was completed in 3 to 4 minutes. And, easy to clean up. Only minor complaint was that the ""butter melter"" did not melt the butter by the time the popcorn finished popping. Over-all, I do recommend the product."
5,Exactly what we wanted,"Popper works great! Most of the popcorn goes in the bowl, it does the job (only 4 or 5 kernels miss the bowl per batch). We used it at least twice a week and are very happy with it."
1,Sparks fly--bad design,"Cons:1. No on/off switch (seriously?)2. When you unplug the unit the socket sparks a TON3. Airstream is blowing up, so the kernals go everywhere.4. Lots of unpopped kernals5. You should only pour in a very small amount of kernals or else you'll have a mess.I used this popper 1 time and plan on taking it back. I've read several other reviews saying the motor catches fire and I'm not taking that risk. My mother has an air-popper from her college graduation that is holding steady and works perfectly and is safe. I guess they don't make them like they used to..."
1,A lot of unpopped Kernels,"Part of me says, ""what did you expect for $20.00?"" Another part says the 2 tablespoons of unpopped kernels that I had after a 1/4 c of kernels was put into the machine doesn't make this a very effective popping tool. A little deeper popping well would have done the trick, I think. There's got to be a better product out there for the popcorn enthusiast."
3,"Works good, but...","I like this product and it works good, but as the corn pops it blows out un-popped kernels. Also the shute is high and needs to come down lower for the popped kernels to go into the bowl."
2,This thing has a mind of it's own,"After seeing how many stars this product got and reading some positive reviews, I was surprised at how well it did NOT work. I've only used it 2 or 3 times and each time at least half of the kernels came flying out of the machine unpopped. Very hot unpopped kernels and popcorn go flying in all directions. I haven't tried tilting it back as one user suggested but will certainly do that next time. It seems like such a waste of popcorn to only pop half the kernels."
5,Great for healthy diet,"Exactly what we wanted. Been using micro popcorn bags and this is so much better. Less kernels, can determine how much salt and or butter goes on.Really fast. Using Orville Red. popcorn with it."
2,"Presto 04820 PopLite Hot Air Popper, White","this pops corn. the plastic parts are horribly fragile and cheaply made, but I did not see any alternative. it came in good delivery time. But it is already somewhat broken and I have to put a saucer on top of it to keep it from blowing popcorn all over the room."
5,"Perfect, Healthy Popcorn","This machine easily pops perfect popcorn every time. Highly recommend. Healthier than cooking in oil or microwave popcorn. Better for the environment than all the packaging that goes with microwave popcorn. We eat popcorn almost daily, so this is a great choice for our family. Also a great price."
4,Presto poplite,Makes Very good popcorn in half the time of stove top with out the mess. Very few if any waisted kernels.
4,Please make air popper in black,"I love this thing, but I have to lug it out of the shelf to use it, then wrap it back up and stick it back in the shelf when I'm done (after i wait for the thing to cool).Please make one in a color that goes with us who have wood or darker kitchens, it looks horrible on the counter in white! black would cover alot of us.Recycle your big brown paper shopping bags, this is a great way to reuse em, just put the bag on the spout and let er rip (nothing will fly all over the place and it can accomodate a double dose of popcorn kernels.You can just pour the butter or whatever in the bag and shake it. If you don't put any oils in the bag you can reuse them a second time"
5,Exelente máquina!,"Muy buena máquina! no hay que agregar aceite por lo que las cotufas son muy sanas, funciona con aire caliente por lo que suben solo las cotufas que estan en su punto, lo que veo que le falta es un interruptor para apagar-prender, hay que conectarlo al toma corriente para que encienda y desconectarlo para apagarla."
5,Popcorn's best friend,"I'm loving this popcorn maker.Pro - quick; simple; easy to clean.Con - on/off switch would be nice, but can get a small power strip if it really bothers you.PS. Other reviews complain about kernels ending up in the bowl. If this bothers you, don't eat popcorn. It is inevitable.Overall: great value for lite style popcorn"
3,It's OK; It Pops,"It pops. But, overfill and it burns the popcorn. How easy is it to overfill? Easy - there is no full indicator. My other gripe is the top - if I look at it the wrong way, it falls off. This means that nearly every time it is taken out or put away, I am picking up the pieces. The top also still off-gases plastic odors when used. As for the popcorn itself, there is does a pretty good job. Most but not all kernels are popped (and that's using premium popcorn kernels). As for ease of use, other than the lid falling off, it's a breeze to use - I have my popcorn ready to go in minutes. I don't use the lid to melt butter, too slow. My secret formula: Melt the butter on the stove, add some powdered curry and then some hot sauce. Add to the popcorn. Sprinkle with salt and add Parmesan cheese."
3,Not Prime Time,I bought this popper based on lots of good reviews by others. It works but...The hot air fan begins blowing kernels out of the popper the minute the cord is plugged in (no AC switch). I have found that leaving the measuring cup / butter warmer out partially helps with this. A more thoughtful design would be even better. No matter how big a bowl you use expect a little counter cleanup 'after the movie'.
4,Works like a charm,"It makes popcorn fast, without adding fat, and is super-easy to clean. I am going to buy one for my home. (This one was purchased for making snacks in an after-school program. The kids really get a kick out of watching the popcorn pop through the clear plastic top.) The butter dish thingee at the top won't actually melt the butter from fridge-hard to liquid in the time it takes the popcorn to pop, though, so that was a bit of a bust. I put it in the microwave. Ours gets pretty heavy usage, and so far, after about six months it is whirring along without a hitch.My only quibble (other than the butter melter that doesn't melt) is that it has no on/off switch. ""On"" is plugged in, ""off"" is unplugged. I'm thinking this wouldn't be an issue at all for home use, 'cuz when the popcorn's popped, you're done with the popper. But if you are making several batches as we typically do for the kids, that 'plug it in, unplug it, plug it in, unplug it"" business can get to be a pain."
5,Very very good and convenient popper,"I used hot plate popper before, but this popper is better than previous one.It is very convenient and effective."
4,Fine for the price,"This popper is fine for the price. I agree with some of the other reviews that an on/off switch would be useful, but other than that it works great. The popcorn comes out perfectly and it really does not leave more than a few kernels unpopped."
5,"Fast, fun, inexpensive snacks!","I purchased the Presto after reading other Amazon reviews. Thanks for the good advice guys! I love my Presto. It's stayed on my counter and at the ready since it arrived! It is inexpensive and it works well: It's fast, not really so noisy, and pops practically every kernel. I don't understand what the big deal is about having to plug it in rather than using an on/off switch. Plugging it in is simple. Don't forget--popcorn is a whole grain! If you are smart about the toppings, it's even healthy!"
5,Great buy and good for the health conscious,"I've owned and used this product for at least two years. It holds up pretty well. Your corn will begin to pop in a matter of minutes. I even caused it to automatically shut off by letting oil get on the grill. But after cleaning up the burnt oil, the unit came back on and have been working well every since. It gets really hot, and the plastic top will become pliable. I wasn't too happy with the melting butter feature, I melted my butter in the micro wave. It pops almost all of the kernels and if your popcorn is of a high quality they will pop up big and fluffy"
4,Exactly like it was described,I wanted to start eating more popcorn and less potato chips. Exactly what I neededYou get lots of popcorn from @ 3 tbs of kennels!!
5,Pops Quick and with a few Shakes Most Kernels,This was a gift and replaced an older air popper. It heats up quick and pops most of the kernels. Once the popper chamber starts to fill with popped corn I shake it a bit to get the remaining kernels to settle on the bottom of the chamber. It helps in popping more kernels. The blower is strong enough to clear the chamber and keeps the popping going.
4,Popcorn Perfection,I am overall very happy with this little popper. It doesn't take up too much counter space and is easy use. My only complaint is that I wish it had an on/off button (you have to plug it in to turn it on).
2,BEWARE! FIRE HAZARD,"For $15 to $20, it's hard to be too picky. But now on our fifth of these, there is a clear pattern of the fan weakening over time. When it occurs, the air flow is not strong enough to push to kernals out of the way during heating, thus trapping the hot air underneath the pile of kernals in the chamber.If you purchase one, watch the beginning of the heating sequence carefully, especially when these get 6-12 months old."
4,faster than the microwave,"This popcorn popper is faster than a microwave and makes much better popcorn. The only thing that is lacking about this popcorn popper is that there is no on/off switch - when it's plugged in, it's on, when it's unplugged, it's off. It's not a deal breaker, but it definitely requires more monitoring than an on/off or an automatic shutoff."
2,Not so great...,"I bought this as an alternative to popping corn on the stove. However, you have to use exactly a 1/2 cup of kernels (if you use less, it hardly pops any at all.) and then there are tons of leftover kernels that spew out of the popper constantly. I returned this and ended up just getting a microwave popper."
4,Cost effective but not perfect,"If you enjoy popcorn and have been using store bought microwave popcorn bags, it doesn't take long to recoup the cost of the Presto PopLite Hot Air Corn Popper. The benefits of having your own popper are being able to apply the seasonings you prefer in the quantities you want. The costs are finding just the right seasonings, the small amount of time in preparing the popcorn and then the clean up afterwards.Hints: I would recommend partly melting the butter in the microwave if it just came out of the fridge and buying a very large wide-mouthed bowl to catch errant popcorn kernals. Also, try real butter with a packet of splenda for very tasty sweet popcorn.Overall, I think this is a fine product."
3,Popper,"This popcorn popper does pop most of the popcorn, however not as well as I would like. I will be looking at other poppers."
5,Air Popped Popcorn the Best!,I decided to get an air popcorn popper after trying it from some friends. It is also much healthier for you or the microwave popcorn. My husband and I really like popcorn and since we got our popcorn popper we use it almost everyday.
2,Makes stale tasting popcorn,"Maybe I am just used to microwave popcorn but no matter what I tried (spraying with oil, shaking on salt, cheese, spices), the popcorn never tasted good. They tasted stale (hard to eat) despite having just been popped, and tasteless."
4,"Great product, we use it everyday","We love this popper and use it all the time. It was a great price, easy to use and makes quick and easy popcorn. The only downside I would say it has the inability to add seasoning or oil to the kernels themselves. This is a minor detail though."
2,Leaks,I recently bought one for the wife. Presto 0484602. It blows half the kernels out of the pit before they pop. The last one we had with the yellow hood was light years better.
5,Best popcorn outside the movie theater!,"I ordered this Presto popcorn makrer for a friend's birthday, and know she is enjoying it. We had one in our family of four children as far back as I can rememver, and that was one thing they all asked for when they went away to college.It is easy to wash, and easy to clean too. All but the base go into the dish washer. By ordering from Amazon, I know it will come in good condition, and in good time!"
4,"Fast, painless way of making popcorn!","I love this hot air corn popper... It is inexpensive, fast at making popcorn, efficient and easy to use. I'm very glad I am using this appliance to make popcorn verses making popcorn in the microwave."
4,heats quickly and corn pops almost completely,I had used a similar products several decades ago and was glad that a simple hotair popcorn popper was still available. Easy and uncomplicated to use.
4,easy to use,"Bought this hot air popper for my dad. He grew some popcorn in his backyard last year so i thought this would be a great gift for him and myself to share the popcorn. This popper uses no oil. You just put in the kernels, plug in the popper and in a few minutes you're done. You have a big bowl of delicious popcorn. He likes it plain, I like it with a little butter spray and a little salt."
2,The un-popper,"This machine comes with a 1/2 cup measurer which serves as the butter melting dish too. If you use less then the full 1/2 cup measure, it throws out lots of unpopped corn. Even with the full 1/2 cup, it throws out a several unpops before it starts popping. The butter melt cup is nice, but the time it takes to pop the corn is not enough time to melt the butter...I even sliced it down to smaller pieces. Also there is no on/off switch. You have to plug it in to turn it on and unplug it to turn it off - that just seems antiquated to me. I do not recommend this popcorn maker."
1,Presto Hot Air Popper,This is one of the worst poppers I have tried. It shoots the popcorn out all over the place even with an oversized bowl. Only half of the kernels pop even with quality popcorn. There is no on and off switch and there are sparks when taking the plug out to stop the appliance. I have not been able to find an air popper to match the one I had years ago by Black and Decker. Still searching though.
