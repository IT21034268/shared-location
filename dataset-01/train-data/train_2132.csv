4,Good Binaural Headset,"Great, comfortable binaural headset. After using it at home for a couple of days, I really enjoy the sound coming into both ears. It helps with those situations in which the caller's voice is less than perfect. Connecting it to the Plantronics M22 amplifier (purchased separately), not only gives volume control, it also allows this headset to work with most any standard telephone. I also purchased the Plantronics DA40 USB adapter to allow connecting the headset to a computer USB port.On the down-side, I was somewhat surprised to find this headset didn't have the Plantronics name as the online picture shows, but instead is made by Avaya. Maybe they bought Plantronics? Another small thing is that packaging of the headset had the appearance of being a refurbished unit. However, after close examination, I can see no evidence (scratches or fingerprints) of this.Overall, I'm well pleased with this unit."
1,Horrible Map - Avoid,"This is NOT the map to buy for your trip to the island. Its old, and many of the roads have changed - new roads aren't on the map! Don't waste your money."
3,Its ok,It is not what i was looking for. I wanted something with.more basic details on the different stitchs. I also thought it eas a hardcovered book. I must habe read it wrong.
2,The paper was different,"I have this product, but when I purchased this notebook from your company, the paper was a differentshade of orchid. It was not the same shade. But, I will say, that I might have not purchased from youwhen I brought this product 6 months ago."
4,Good.,First of I wanted to point out that this Bearing Buddy does NOT come with the rubber dust caps (AKA: Bearing Buddy Bra). I called Bearing Buddy and they said that the covers are included with some Bearing Buddies and it depends on what style packaging the retailer chooses. I purchased these to replace a Bearing Buddy that flew off my popup camper about 10 minutes into our trip after installing them. I may have made the mistake of greasing the mating surface between the Bearing Buddy and the hub - something the folks at BB confirmed that should not be done. Wish me luck!
2,cannot put lens cap,This filter do not have an front thread and cannot put my Canon lens cap so I have returned it and purchase diff. B+W filter with a front thread so I can put my len cap to onto it to protect the filter.
3,Legend hunting,"This DVD was not really what I personally was looking for. I was hoping for Iroquois legends, what they believed and why, etc. Instead I got a documentary on some places ""haunted"" by Iroquois. There was SOME Iroquois mythology, but it was very sparse. The DVD subject was still fairly interesting. I can't say that I came away convinced about the subject or methods used, but it was interesting non-the-less. If you are delving into Iroquois mythology this is a dead end road. If you are a spook enthusiast or are fascinated by the unexplainable/supernatural then this is very interesting and would be a good DVD for you."
5,awesome,works as advertised best I can remember. Only thing is it seems to burn through propane faster then what I was expecting
5,Very Powerful,"Bought this for my garage to replace a 30-yr old kerosene heater. Have outdoor hot tub and like to go into garage rather than the house to dry off. I like it to be at least 50 F in there, which is all the kerosene heater could manage, even if on for an hour prior to going out there. This heater literally takes about 10 minutes to heat my 2-car garage to 65F, and will take it up to 70F. I turn it off then. This is all done on the lowest setting. My disclaimer is that it hasn't gone below 32F outside yet. It was hard to start the first few times, but now it cranks up in 30 seconds (or less). It is POWERFUL, so watch out you don't burn down your house."
4,"Super warm, but requires caution",This thing will heat up my garage in 20 minutes to a very comfortable temperature. Caution should be used where it can be touched accidentally. I put it under a counter when it running on low. A fan is required to circulate the warm air.
4,Great heater for the money,"I bought this as a supplement to a kerosene jet heater that I also use in my garage. I use the jet for quick heat up in the winter, but the down side is the fumes and lack of thermostat. This (Mr. Heater) heater is great if you are going to be working around it because it's cleaner burning and collapses for storage. It puts off a little bit of black ash if you burn it too low, but turn it up and it goes away."
2,Ugh. Where's the Bat MAN?,"I read these in order fairly close together with this being the third and final installment in the series. Not only is this the last one, it's easily the worse one in my book. I understand how some may love it for it's tales of angst of good vs evil and pre vs post vampire batman and who's really less evil then who...but wow I did not care for this. The proper ending did not justify having to trudge through the rest of this story. Beside the supporting cast of characters, this is nothing that resembles a batman tale. They should have stopped after the second. Not only did that one end perfectly, but this sends it into another direction that many of us would rather not see our hero go. This is worth reading only for the completionists. Over the top killing left and right and ugly looking drawings of a vampire batman await those who dare take the challenge."
4,As good or better than the 1st one,"""Baking with Julia Vol. 2"" is as good or better than the first one released. Like many other reviewers I too wish they would just put the entire series on one set and be done with it. The Dvds, I & 2 are still not a not a complete complement to the series' cookbook ""Baking with Julia"" which is mentioned throughout the programs. Other than that- it is a delight to see Julia interacting with some of the best Bakers in the country. The recipes are awesome and the filming is crisp and clear. The food photos are gorgeous and mouthwatering with every presentation. All eight episodes are delightful, entertaining and informative."
5,Everything You Need to Know,"Julia Childs is a wonderful teacher, providing from down to earth to the highest levels of cookery-do. If you like watching The Iron Chef, you'll learn just how they do it, from Julia. Highly recommended!"
5,Great Intro to IP Multicast,"I come from a routing shop - never having a customer need for Multicast. This book brought me up to speed very quickly on the both the beauty and ease of Multicast. As a tool for my CCIE studies, I felt the first 200 pages were of immense value at helping my studies. I felt Chapter 5 (on DVMRP) was not nearly as valuable as Chapters 6 and 7 (on PIM-DM and PIM-SM).Some typos I was able to pick out:page 144 - 2nd line from bottom should read ""...it too sends a Graft message to Router C"" - not Router D.page 168 - 3rd line on the 1st paragraph should read ""...SPT to pull the (S2, G) traffic down to the RP..."" - not (S1, G).There are some other typos, but they are few and far between (but I'm not an expert on multicast!). I have heard of this book being talked about as the 'bible' for multicast - I can see why.I give this book 5 pings out of 5:!!!!!"
4,The third cd of one of the best anime soundtracks ever made,This cd is the third installment of one of the most popular anime series ever made . It is a very wide ranging cd with many backgroud music which reminds you ( if you've seen it) of moments in the series. The first two songs are pop but very hard to remember until you listened to it a couple of times. The backgroud music Included in this are musics of military content and marching music but very interesting to hear ( what would you expect if you want pop music get an pop cd ). Any way If you don't unterstand Japanese it is o.k there are only two songs in Japanese and the rest are just moody music with very philosofical names added to it . The rest of the cd or shall I say the secomd half of the cd is dedicated to different versions of fly me to the moon ( This will make sense if you've seen the series ) Very enjoyable and well worth it if you want something new .
1,This useless out of region rip-off,"This is a rip-off by Amazon that does not play on US Blu-Ray machines, but was not indicated in the selling site. I am totally disappointed and feel robbed."
5,"excellent watch, great value","I have been looking for an automatinc diver's watch for a while and I found this great deal at Amazon. This watch is a classic example of Japanese craftmanship quality. Excellent finish and precision, just a glance at the smooth cursory movement of the second hand is enough to realize what a nice mechanism this watch has. Simple, no bells and whistles watch, does the job, looks and feels great."
5,Nu-Metal? That's Kind of Insulting,"The complex guitar work here is far from what one'd expect from a nu-metal band (and that's not to insult one of my favorite musical genres). It's delicate, technical and even when it reaches points of head-banging bliss, it still manages to avoid a cliched sound. Zo's lyrics are deep - if a little direct - and his distinct vocal style powers many of the tracks here. I'm glad these guys were able to focus enough to put out 14 tracks of brilliance like this, and they're yet another example of a band that will always be remembered by its legions as great for the one released album."
4,Pulse Ultra,"i bought this CD a while back and i love it! all the songs sound great and i think they should make a 2nd CD aswell.My favorite song is Slip In Sin, i have a music video for it in my head and it goes perfectly with the song!"
4,"It's different, it's powerful...it's great","For me 'Headspace' is one of the best albums of 2002. Pulse Ultra is a great band who has a amazing style, specially notably on the guitar riffs. Guitar player Dominic is no doubt a great hard rock/metal guitarist. The music have also a 'atmospheric-like' sound on it, which I love it. It's a complex music, with good lyrics too, good drum tracks and average vocals.I think all the songs are great but I specially like 'Finding my place', 'Never the culprit', 'Void', 'Build your cages', 'Look closer' and 'Despot'."
3,This is just ok,This CD is just ok there are many better bands out there. I do like several of the songs but this CD does not command my attention at all. Lead singer sounds a little whiny at times.
1,THIS BAND SUCKS,"this cd sucks this band sucks i agree with uber guy they are generic, no let me take that back their super generic i know generic come on i listen to breaking benjamin their generic but not as generic as pulse ultra and another thing the guys voice is to whiny. he need to quit crying when he sings good examples of this are the bands that didnt get hug enough so they sings songs about my girlfriend left,i hate myparents and so on and so forth. i could keep going but i would like to go to sleep so the short and the long of it they suck and bands like them suck buy the good stuff."
2,talk about bitter,"Whoa. Andrew Kazdin's book gives a nice window into Gould's studio methods -- the sometimes devious, always crafty way of manipulating sounds to create the perfect studio product -- and his personality. The book is hurt tremendously, though, by the extreme bitterness of the author. Kazdin (Gould's recording producer for CBS) claims to have been wronged by the pianist in business matters. This could have been an excellent book about a pioneer of music and audio engineering, but instead it is ruined by personal squabbles involving the author. For a third person account of Gould's life, I recommend Otto Friedrich's biography. For an account of his music, try Payzant's book _Glenn Gould, Music and Mind_."
4,It's not just about Gould,I was happy to find this book in the local library for the insight into recording the Hindemith sonatas. I've conducted oral histories with two of the performers--but never would have known about Gilbert Johnson's experience with being held captive in Canadian customs for hours before recording the trumpet sonata if not for this book. I would love to know more about Mr. Kazdin's recording techniques--The Antiphonal Music of Gabrieli is remarkable.
3,pretty good,"This book was okay,but not wonderful.I thought Carole was being sort of unrealistic thinking that she and Lisa could train Samson all by themselves.They're only what,12.You can't be the perfect trainer when your 12.Other than that this book was pretty good."
4,Mary Pickford is winsome and adorable,"This was my first opportunity to see a complete film of Mary Pickford's, and its not difficult at all to see why she was considered ""America's Sweetheart"". She's a delight - sweet and lovable, but not at all syrupy or coy, with one of the most charming smiles imaginable.This 1918 comedy holds up rather well, with the necessary allowances for changing times and mores. Mary's a working-class Irish girl with a washer-woman ma and 5 rambunctious younger brothers. She's been seeing her equally working-class bartender boyfriend for 3 years, without even a kiss (like I said, she must have had a lot of charm to manage that!), but gets involved with dashing upper-crust sculptor Norman Kerry (who's handsome even to modern eyes). No surprises, it all ends well, but there are many cute and charming moments along the way, and the film flows together quite nicely given its age."
2,Fails to disprove evolution,"I have read a heck of a lot of the works of Ron Rhodes, especially his Mormon material. As with his treatment of Mormonism, his approach to Evolution is riddled with logical fallacies, such as his fraudulent discussion of the 2nd law of Therodynamics and Maco Evolution, as well as his fudging when it comes to a 6,000 year-old earth and a global flood - just where is the evidence for these and other occurances, apart from circukar reasoning? Also, he ignores the impossibility of a literal approach to Genesis when it comes to the Tower of Babel, by not even attempting to defend this incident and the ultra-literalist apprach he and other creationists have.This book is nothing more than card-stacking and is only for the gullible or already converted. No individual well-versed in evolution would buy any of the non-sensical assertions Rhodes makes in this book."
4,important information,"With the pace of life in today's world, it is very important to get as much information as possible, from as many points of view as possible. I found this book to be fact based and very current This information is important because most mainstream sources only provide one side of this debate. Well written and very readable."
2,I'd only recommend this to a 1st grader w/ a love 4 ghouls,"My son just read this book and gives it a ""5"" out of ""10"" which I equate to a 2 1/2 here. He read it with gusto, emphasizing each ""Boooooo"" but overall found it a bit boring and not at all ""hilarious"" (unlike Dragon's Halloween by Dav Pilkey which had us both smiling from beginning to end). The repetitiveness of the repeated rhyming patterns was dull for a big kid (3rd grade) and the creatures too spooky for my younger daughter (1st grade) who is not into ghoulies at all. The ""mad doctor"" brought back some memories of lost hours I'd like to recover while watching Stephen King's ""Kingdom Hospital"" but other than that I found it pretty blah as well. Save your $ and buy the charming Pilkey book instead."
2,Very Dissapointing...,"I hate to be the negative one here, but this CD in my opinion just doesn't do it for me. I have seen Mr. Paul in concert at least 20 times over the years and while the performances on this CD are good, to me it just doesn't work. Personally, I feel that the most dissapointing aspect of this album are the new tunes. Why? Because it is Ellis continuing to be Ellis. He isn't changing anything at all. I'm tired of hearing about sidewalks and angels and all that other urban folksong stuff. The music is getting uninspired and frankly, just boring. He is regurgitating the same thing we have heard for years. Look at Dylan and Tom Waits, two often cited Ellis Paul influences. What makes them so great is that they change it up and push the boundaries of their music. Ellis has yet to do that. He has the potential to be brilliant, but still has a way to go. Sorry to be so negative, but the man is starting to become the Michael Bolton of folk music..."
5,Amazing and completely engaging,"I had never heard Ellis Paul's music before my brother played ""Live"" for me, and I completely fell in love. Ellis' music runs such a gamut, it is impossible to compartmentalize. ""Angel in Manhattan"" is my favorite, but guitar doesn't get much better than ""Autobiography of a Pistol."" I own dozens of folk CDs, but this is my favorite one. Also, Ellis is one hell of a funny guy, and his stories prove it. Awesome."
1,This guide is a complete waste of money,"On the up side it's got lots of pretty, out of focus pictures and it's 223 pages long. If you are worried about spoilers you won't find any here. It's just a straight walk through. With a few pages on the mini games an a few on game basics. It also has lists of items, not particularly helpfull. Also not helpfull is the amount space dedicated to the 108 stars. If you play the game you should have no problem finding at least 106 stars. Gau you have to stumble across in a random battle. Snow is really the only one you will have any difficulty finding. Do yourself a favor check online at gamefaqs. You will find better, more detailed walkthroughs that actually have the info you need for free. Don't waste your money here. If you are dead set on buying this waste of paper at least look at a hard copy first before putting down your money."
5,This was a really cool book!,This book about my favorite boy band was really cool! All of the stuff in the book was factual and there were some really cute pictures of the guys in there. There's a lot of stuff on each one of the guys personally and also stuff about the group as a whole. A fantastic book for any fan!
4,So-so,"Okay, this book is pretty good...it was my very first *NSYNC book and I think it's got some pretty good stuff in it.Of course, it is unauthorized, which means the guys didn't stamp their names on it, and it has some inaccuracies in it. Of course, you might not notice it if you weren't a freak like me.I think this is a great gift for a young fan...however, if you're older or a freak like me, then this definitely is a bit beyond your obsession for these hot and talented guys."
4,Great writing for saxophone sections!,"Every sax has an interesting line to play, even the inner parts. This is well thought out writing by a master player. Lenny's alto playing soars as well. I bought it for the writing."
3,"1st CD is Not So Good, but the 2nd is.","Pros: My wife Loves it, and we all know, ""If Mama ain't happy, no ones happy."" Quick delivery from Amazon.Cons: I didn't like the 1st CD so well, but I thought the 2nd one was great. I guess that's pretty typical though."
3,cool,"i was happy to finally have some of these songs on disc.too much new stuff,that is hardly the best of gold city.Can anyone explain to me how in the world they left off ""there rose a lamb"".3 stars for that reason"
4,Fast-moving adventure is good fun for children.,"Do Batman and Robin really need a third member of the team? The answer is an unqualified ""yes,"" as this audio adventure proves. Adapted from Doug Monech's book, this story--set right after the events of the BATMAN & ROBIN film--shows Batgirl overcoming her misgivings to help the Dynamic Duo solve the mystery of Black Mask and the False Face Society. The voices are well-done for the most part; Deborah Stoll seems a little old for the role of Batgirl, and she doesn't sound like Alicia Silverstone at all, but she carries the role off with aplomb. Also in the cast are Don Leslie (as Batman), Jim Soriero (as Robin), and longtime character actor Edward Herrmann makes a memorable Black Mask. TO DARE THE DARKNESS will be a lot of fun for kids to listen to, especially girls, who will love listening to Batgirl save Gotham City! END"
2,The mighty organ versus the mighty fats,Is this what you would expect from the meeting of the two mighty ones? Not entirely. The material is certainly there in the Fats Waller music and the playing skills of the organ-meister. But somehow it didn't hit the heights I expected not acheive the depth of tone richness we have come to expect from Jimmy Smith works. I think a great deal of this was down to a very basic remastering that left the sound in mono which was offputting to say the least. Feel a bit cheated by what was a very ordinary production.
5,Snatch it up when you see a copy!,"These devilish, clever ""cautionary"" poems charmed me at age 8 and charm me now. They're darkly funny, something I understood as a child. I think that's fine: like classic fairy tales, Belloc's verses play with the dangers of childhood, dangers children intutively understand. Whenever I run across a copy of this book, usually in its 1970s turquoise cloth, I snatch it up to give to elect children or asute peers.For me, Belloc's verses provided a playful connection to late-Victoriana and my own Grandmother's childhood. I think it's a shame they're no longer in print. Belloc is like a more humane Ogden Nash-- his verse is clever, but he lack's Nash's smugness and the oftentimes mechanical composition. I certainly will not ""protect"" my children from these charming poems!"
5,Fantastic,"I cannot say enough about this recording. I currently have this running over and over again in my car ... and I've easily had this disc for 4 years. It simply never gets old. I've heard many different performances of these two symphonies, and this is by far the best I have heard. It is absolutely wonderful.When I first began listening, even my 4 year old enjoyed listening (the 4th movement of Sym. 9 was his favorite)."
5,"Excellent, informative and easy to read.","This book is perfect for anyone wanting to learn more about creating prosperity and building financial security. It's very educational, easy to understand, and has already helped me a lot. I'm telling all my friends about it and highly recommend it to anyone."
4,the monkees pisces aquarius & jones Ltd,The monkees at their best. This was my favorite Monkee Album. The set includes both the Stereo and Mono versions of the Album with extras. I really enjoy listening to this Cd.
4,Tied with Headquarters as their best album,"On several songs, The Monkees almost achieve Beatledom.I can give no higher compliment.The Monkees were a very good band who, because of their perceived ""fakeness"", are seriously underrated and overlooked. Naysayers should give this album a listen.If you're a Monkees fan, you'll love it. If you're not a Monkees fan, give it a chance."
5,"Monkees CD Aquarius,Capricorn & Jones Ltd 2CD",Awesome will buy from again. Thanks for the fast shipping. Love the CD. The best won I think they made in my opinion.
5,Go ahead and read,"Livingston has a unique way. His thoughts about the audience, the artist's attitude, the live experience...Everything have very experienced and different point of views, and you end up learning lots. This book helps the artist being more genuine, and I definetely recommend it."
4,Pretty Good Book - Shorter & thinner than I expected though!,"I enjoyed Mr. Taylor's style of writing and the way he laid out the book like the course he teaches. I was surprised when it first arrived at how slim and small the book is. Great for carrying around and reading but I felt he could have told me more for the money :) Maybe that's just me. As a performer with 13 years experience, I thought he made lots of good points and I agree with most of them. Would be a great book for a beginner."
5,These guys are great!,"Grimm and Yarnold really offer great, user-friendly explanations of stats. I've used these for 3 years now, and they were great for getting through coursework and dissertation.I highly recommend these books!"
4,Awesome CD,"The Crucified were one of Christian music's first reputable heavy bands. The music didn't suck like Stryper or Guardian, and the message was relevant then and still matters today. They have a heaviness and intensity equal to anything in the late 80's punk/thrash scene. The music is very fast but also brilliant in it's composition. Jim Chaffin has some awesome stuff on the drums, most notably on ""Rise"", ""The Crucial Moment"", and ""A Guy in a Suit and the Pope"". This is an awesome album and represents well the talents of one of the greatest underground Christian bands of all time."
1,this rage against the machine cover band suck ass!!!,"what a bootleg sound these guys have...lets completely jock the ENTIRE RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE style and try to make money off of it....from the lyrics, guitar riffs, melodies and overall sound of this crappy band is a direct steal from one of the greastest political bands of our time. if i could give this no stars i would...sonny bones needs to die...."
5,when's the new album?,"I listen to this album all the way through at lest 3x's a week... it pumps me up when i'm feeling blue, and it calms me down when i need calming. awesome work! when are you guys gonna put another album together!WORD!"
5,sonny bones are my favorite band,"sonny bones are awesome, and when I say they are my favorite band, I mean they are my favorite band. you've gotta just check'em out, especially at the price. once they really RISE it wont stay like that forever, so check'em out."
1,So boring they won't watch it,"You are better off getting some simple flash cards. My 2 1/2 year old grandson cries and runs from the room when I put one of these dvd's in to play. Leap frog keeps him interested, so its not because its a learning video, I believe its the format. The video dispays a word and then says it, over and over again. Sometimes there is a little animation but its confusing because the animation has nothing to do with the word. Big waste of money. There has to be a better way out there to teach sight words."
5,26 Month Old Reading Sight Words,"I purchased other Preschool Prep DVDs and my son learned his colors, shapes, numbers, and letters. He learned the letter sounds from a Starfall app that I had on my IPad. I purchased Meet The Sightwords thinking I would get the same result. At first I was disappointed when I watched it because to me the graphics did not go with the words. To my surprise my son learned all the sight words from Meet The Sight Words 1 in two days. He is now pointing to words he knows when we are reading books. He is now watching Meet The Sight Words 2 and is learning. I am so thrilled with the results."
3,repetitive,"was very excited to get these because of the great advertising on the packaging and others reviews. After about 3 minutes my 18 month old was soon bored. It has fun characters but not enough going on. Just repeating the number, letter, color, or shape. We have other videos that do the same but use real images or video clips of animals, vehicles, nature, and house hold items that is much more interesting for the child and the family who is also watching. If you want to start your baby off with memorizing the alphabet because it has been burnt into their mind like a bad record then these may be a good start. One thing that is good about these is you can chose to watch only the song or ""flash cards"" which is just the same repetitive items just in random order. Maybe I just had high expectations for the price. In retail store it was almost $50 but got it through amazon for much less."
5,My son loves these DVDs,"My son, who is 2.5 years old, loves these DVDs and all the other Preschool Prep series. I couldn't get him to read books as he can't sit still, but he can watch these will full concentration, over and over again. He also learns very quickly from the DVDs. I also some DVDs from Leap Frog but he just wasn't interested in them. Highly recommend these."
1,THE WORST,"Well in my opinion, this has to be the worst learning DVD set ever. My 4 year old son cries when I sit him down and make him watch them! After a few times of he and I watching the videos I became bored to tears and understands his frustration. The vidoe doesn't even spell the words for the children, it just jumps across the screen a few times. It is a total waste of money! I wonder if I can get a refund! Leap frog videos are the better choice. I have not seen a sight word DVD collection from them but my son loves their videos and I can tell what he has learned!"
3,Just OK,"I bought this for my 4 year old to help reinforce what she's learning in preschool and at home. The set is okay, but I think it could be much more engaging. While they do ""say"" the words several times for memorization and recognition, the animation is really basic and boring. It may be interesting to 9 month to 2 year olds, but my toddler lost interest very quickly. She doesn't look forward to watching it, so we have to bribe her to watch it.I would hand it down to her future siblings, but would start them watching it much earlier so that we can advance to something more exciting by age 3."
5,Sight Words DVD,My students loved the DVD. I use them in my classroom for slow learners and regular learners and both groups love the DVD.
3,Basically Happy with Purchase,"I liked the shapes, colors, numbers and letters better, but this one is good also."
3,It's Ok,I think the younger the better for this set. My four year old will set down and watch it but my 7 year old is not interested at all. Probably would work really well for 2-4 years of age.
3,Creative Sight Word DVD,"These DVDs are very colorful and creative. They are also a reasonable price; however, they didn't hold my daughter's attention. I am not sure if it is because of the repetition of the words throughout the DVD or not, but it is something to be aware of."
3,These are ok.,I thought these were more like a story cartoon to watch. My kids thought they were boring just seeing the words with not much else going on.
1,Not what I wanted,"My son was bored the second I started the DVD. I found this DVD to be slow and not that interesting. It maybe for others, but not for my son and I."
3,Okay,"I will have to give it another try with my dauther. Did not hold her attention very well, but I am not going to give up."
5,Meeet the sight words box set,"I bought this for my 5 year old. She loves it! I also have a 2 year old boy, who is extremely active. He never watches television. But he actually sits and views these videos and recites the words."
3,Meet the Sightwords,"My daughter's teacher recommended these DVD's. I use them in the car when we are driving. I was hoping they would be a bit more like the Leap Dvd's but instead they use repetition as the sole source of learning. It tends to get a bit boring after a while. My 6 year old will watch them for a little while but does get bored with them. My 3 year old will watch them longer. Overall, not a bad way to introduce the sight words and in the car where there is nothing else to watch the dvd will hold their attention a bit more."
5,Terrific!,Our 2 1/2 year old twins love these videos and they remember all the words after watching them for only one week. They far exceeded our expectations!!!
1,got it broken,first time ordering lights for my car and i got it broken im sending it back hoping to get a working one it has a magnet attched to it but it falls off the dash board not really worth it but whatver
5,happy customer,i was very please when i saw the price on your web site for the light and when it came in the mail i was more then happy that i choose that light it works grea and i would recommend it to anyone.
1,Disapointed,I was totally disappointed with this product. Stopped working within a month. This is a poor product. Do not recommend.
1,FAULTY PRODUCT,"ORDERED 2 OF THESE ITEMS THE BLUE ONE FAILED AFTER LIMITED USE. THE RED ONE STOPPED WORKING AFTER I KEPT IT IN THE BOX FOR 90 DAYS THAN PLUGGED IT IN. BY CONTRAST, I HAVE USED ANOTHER MODEL FOR OVER 12 YEARS TO MONITOR WHEN THE POWER IS ON TO MY GARAGE DOOR OPENER and the only issue has been 2 bulb changes and the plastic dome has gone dingy in the extreme CHICAGO WEATHER."
4,VERY VISIBLE AFTERNON & NIGHT,"it's been 2 weeks and it worked good , fun stuff but illegal to use by regular people ... people will pull over !! the cable is a little short .."
4,"Could be brighter, and quieter","The light works fantastic at night, as the light looks very bright. But during the day time, the light is hardly visible and does not draw attention. Also, the motor is very loud.But for the price? Unbeatable. I would recommend as a temporary or starter light."
1,You get what you pay for,"You really do get what you pay for with this prudct. There aren't alot of details about the product but looking at the light the bulb is a 20w bulb, barely bright enough at night. Light cannot be seen during the day so don't be suprised when no one pulls over. This is a very cheap product which is suprising from wolo, but hey what do you expect for $20?? good first light when you first join that fire dept, but be ready to upgrade once you know that you wanna actually get to the fire station!"
4,Anthology,"Naturally, as an anthology, you get a mixture of styles. Some steamy and some langsamweilig. One is a direct excerpt from Dracula. One is more a Victorian translation of an Arabian erotic tale (probably not from 1001 nights)."
5,Great Baby Shower Gift,"I bought this for my son when he and his wife were expecting their first son. He did not want to carry a traditional diaper bag. He wanted something that was more ""manly."" He is also in the Army, so this was the perfect gift for him. He absolutely loved it."
3,Lacks depth,"Whereas I am always greateful when new Holmes stories are released, particularly in anthology form, and as long as they do not deal with utterly bizarre places or events, I found that these stories were rather lack-luster. Within the first three days I had the book, I read through five pieces, none of which were as remarkable as I hoped they would be. The usual contributors are here, and one can usually expect outstanding entries by Loren D. Estleman and Edward B. Hoch, but here their stories are as flat as the rest. Hopefully in their next effort, the writers will write more engaging tales."
4,Good but Is Missing Some of the Greats,"This is a good compilation but it's missing some of the big hits like Tuesady's Gone, Needle and Spoon, Don't Ask me no Questions, etc. Besides those 3 songs missing and some others I can't think of at the moment I would definately recommend this CD."
4,Nice Collection but Tuesday is Gone,"PRONice collection and at a good price.CONYet, I rank the classic ""Tuesday's Gone"" (not included) above these four songs below that were included:Swamp MusicCall Me the BreezeComin' HomeAll I Can Do Is Write About ItThese four are great songs but ""Tuesday's Gone"" is better and more important and relevant in my feeble opinion.NICEThe inclusion of ""The Ballad of Curtis Lowe"" is a nice touch. Haven't seen that one on a greatest hits."
5,Lynrd Skynyrd Rocks!,Lynrd Skynyrd is the ultimate of southern rock! This was a band I listened to when I was young and I feel young when I hear their songs again. You won't be disappointed if you decide to buy this CD.
4,Lynyrd Skynard,"My husband loves it, it was a Valentine's Day gift. Also please change my name on my account from Karen Sims to Karen Devine, due to my marriage. Thank you."
3,"Frankly, I could do without another Greatest Hits Collection","I'm sorry, I'm a big fan of Skynyrd, but this is not the compilation for you. There is so much missing from here. It's nice as an introduction to Skynyrd, maybe the parents out there are reading this, and if your kid would like to get into Skynyrd, hey buy all means. But for those of you who know Skynyrd's music, this isn't really high on the ""To buy"" list."
2,ok.,This is a ok album. But where is the rest of the good songs like working for mca? The live version of Freebird is crappy.
3,"good, but not there greatest","this is a okay cd, but they need more live stuff and where is Tuesdays Gone? That song should be there, it is right up there with freebird"
1,Skynard,The music is fine. The same can't be said for the CD. It played fine at first but within 2 weeks it started to lose cuts and be less and less reliable. The same player plays other CD's with no problems. This one is heading for the recycling bin.Don't waste your money.
3,All Time Greatest Hits?,"ok, this is good but not great!!! I am looking for a great liveverseion of Free bird. I bought a live album from Lynyrd Skynyrdcalled LYVE, it was ok but not good. This contains all their bighits such as SWEET HOME ALABAMA, GIMME THREE STEPS, & CALL METHE BREEZE. AVOID SIMPLE MAN PLEASE BECAUSE IT WILL MAKE YOUCRY. ANYWAY, RECOMMENDED."
1,where is my CD,"My CD has not arrived and it was paid for many weeks ago, I would like to know where it is ?"
5,Blast from the Past,Another selection for my brother. He loves the bands from his ypunger years and this will definitely make his day to add this one to his collection.
4,Great Songs,This is one of my favorite bands of all time and this collection of songs has all of my favorite hits included for a great price!!!!
2,thought my wife liked skynrd,"i really only liked two songs on this album, i guess i'm not a big Skynyrd fan. Sorry to upset so many."
2,freeturd,"I wont knock this because it means something to somebody, but don't forget all the better music out there. Put up your AC/DC and Stevie Ray, and go purchase a Stones, Doors, or Neil Young album."
5,The Best Thing to Happen to Us,"I didn't have any idea what a difference The Voucher System would make with my strong willed child and other children. Not only did I have a kit complete with colorful vouchers, points sheets and other useful tools, but the free Newsletter and personal consultation with the author supplied me with a veriety of information I could use. This Voucher System is the best this to happen to us in a long while. I highly recomend this program for parent with a high maintence child. It works well with all of our children!Additopnally, I am a school bus driver and use the vouchers with my special needs kids. They respond very well. One student in particlar,was fascinated by the vouchers and worked exceptionally hard to earn them. Before we started the voucher system he was out of control and unable to stay buckled in his seat for any length of time. That all changed in the first week and he remained one of our best behaved kids the rest of the year!"
2,Describes the system well enough,"but I am putting only two stars because I was expecting a book while it's more like a small brochure. I ordered by mistake the first edition for $36, while the 2nd edition costs $29. That book is way overpriced, and I don't get the logic as to how they priced it."
1,Item not as described,"As was the case with the previous reviewer, I did not receive the item that was described. It is not a Professional Outdoor Cooker but a Commercial grade cooker. In addition, there are no baskets included. This set-up might be fine for frying a turkey but would not work for frying fish without additional equipment. What you'll get is what is shown in the picture - not what is described."
3,"Great quality, but item features misleading.","The quality of this cooker is excellent. Definitely a bargain for the price paid $39.99. We did purchase this because it said in the features that an aluminum basket and fish fry pot & basket were included. AT least, that's what we thought Features meant. This package comes with everything but those things. I've contacted customer service about this and they are being very helpful."
1,Misleading Advertisement,"Just received this item purchased on 11/21, Unfortunately at that time there were no reviews on it.Again as previous reviews state:Item is not a Professional Outdoor Cooker as listed Still, but a Commercial Grade Cooker; this printed right on the box.Features have now been changed, Orginally stated included with an aluminum basket and fish fry pot & basket. I received the items as listed now. All in All it does appear to be a nice cooker, but I bought it for the versitiliy of the features listed previously. Contacting Customer Service on this Misleading Advertisement."
4,Great product for a great price.,I really like the cooker. I have used it for shrimp boils and it is perfect. I did have to purchase a basket to go inside. Finding the basket was not easy or inexpensive. In fact the basket cost me more than the cooker ($39). Factor that in to your purchase.
5,Flea Fly Flo,"Flea's 'instructional' video is much like any other artist attempting to instruct. You have to glean from it what you can until you get up to there level of playing. If you don't have them doing 'what they do' and have everything they play broken down and spoon fed, how do you expect to learn. Analyse and break down and rebuild in your own way and according to your own mind. I love this video, it is a real challenge and insight.Interestingly, Flea used to play in a school jazz band and play the trumpet which alone suggests that he knows a little more than he lets on. Also, if he's jamming with the Chad then John is in the band; just to point that out to the other reviewer."
4,An Important Snapshot in US History,This period in American history was extremely important to the future of the nation and the book captures the time very well in its photographic layout and narrative. Very well done its an easy read with lots of color images and I was glad to have it for my American history library.
5,Delicious Gluten Free Muffins,"I have been looking for this mix again. These muffins are gluten free, but taste as good as any regular muffins I have ever had. I hope they come back in stock."
4,Jingle Jangle Morning,Old favorites and wonderful new discoveries in store for the Big Star fan or the recovering college DJ.
1,terrible and not stable,I bought this rail and it wabbles way to much. If you land on the rail and your pushing the rail a little bit to the left or right it slides or tips over. The middle piece makes the rail wabble back and forth and the black grips on the bottom dont work when they get dusty and eventaly fall off. Anyone woould be better off just buying some pvc and making a circular or flatbar p-rail.
5,Beautiful color!,Love the color of the eyeshadow and am a loyal customer of Clinique. Arrived on time.
3,oldies,never bought this album when it came out so was wondering what it was like who knows what might have been had he not been sick but this album did not live up to the megatron man album but if your a patrick cowley fan you will find a wealth of listning pleasure on this cd happy to add to my collection.
5,A satisfied gamer,"I loved this game for GBC. It is by far and wide the best sports game out there for Game Boy. I would recommend. It has all the new teams, players, stats, etc. You can have a season, exhibition, home run derby, or go straight to the playoffs. It's Great!"
4,Griffey... and the rest of the gang in the dugout,"Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest has awesome graphics with assorted diagrams to let you know the situation of the game: who's pitching, who's batting, balls, strikes, outs, and who's on base. I loved playing Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest mainly because of the choice of things to do. You can play a World Series, a Home Run Derby, an entire season, or just a regular game. You can change your lineup and bullpen, and in the season mode, you can view your schedule, any division's standings, and trade players! If you are a baseball fan, Ken Griffey Jr.'s Slugfest is sure to be a grand slam!"
4,Greatest game ever made!,"This is the greatest game that has ever been made for the gbc system. Great features like trading, stats, standings, and more. I highly recomend this game to anyone. I have had it a year and a half and still can't put the dang thing down."
4,Portable baseball for the fan,This game is excellent. The graphics are great for a GBC game and the difficulty level is just right. The autofield function makes it suitable for younger players and those of us that are just not that coordinated. The trading feature is also a nice touch. I already have Griffey playing for the Reds.
2,boring,this game is lame. it's slow too. the ball mostly goes into a fowl. don't waste your money. its almost imposible to win as well.
3,No fue para lo q lo quería,"Pues para tratar asuntos del sueño y eso, debo decir q es bastante bueno, xq efectivamente me permitía dormir sabroso, tanto así q x las mañanas no me quería levantar.El asunto es q adicional lo compré para aumentar los niveles de serotonina en el cerebro, pero la serotonina consumiida así no cumple la función necesaria... en cambio, el 5-HTP sí lo hace, xq la transforma del L-Triptofano, entonces, ese es el siguiente producto que compré y pues me está comenzando a dar buenos resultados."
3,Comprehensive Lactation Consultant Exam Review,"This practice exam was much more difficult than the real exam. Many of the questions are not practical and are poorly worded. If you can perform well on this exam, you will do well on the real exam. The pictures on the CD appear old and many do not even relate well to the question. It caused much frustration to me and 6 of my Lactation Collegues. I hope there is a better choice out there for exam review."
4,FYI,"Just to clarify- because the book was not what I expected- The first section is an outline of the content areas of the test with references to readings. There is no actual review information here, just a long list of references for you to go out and find on your own. Very similar information is available on the IBLCE webpage for free. The 2nd part is 3 practice exams, and there is a CD that has pictures that go along with the exam questions (i.e. the question asks about what is in the picture). I was hoping for a review of information, and that's not what's in here. But the practice exams are useful."
5,excellent test prep for the IBCLE exam,This book was very helpful in preparing for the IBCLE exam. The photos on the included CD were similar to those found in the exam. The questions and review sections were also very instrumental.
3,Buy hardcopy of book not kindle edition,"I was excited to buy the kindle version of this book so I could study on the go. Unfortunately it does not contain the images for the questions or the access code to obtain the images online. The help desk from jblearning was helpful, however this is the only version of the book that does not give you access to the online prep. better to buy the paperback copy. Wish that it was more clear on the Amazon website."
1,DO NOT BUY THE KINDLE VERSION!!!!!!!,"I was so excited to receive this Kindle version for my birthday to study for the exam on my iPad. THE KINDLE VERSION DOES NOT COME WITH THE ACCESS CODE TO VIEW THE PICTURES THAT ARE NECESSARY TO TAKE THE TESTS!!!!!! So, in effect, you almost waste your money, which is really disappointing. The publisher said I could purchase the access code for more than the book is worth. I REALLY hope they make a change to this situation because the resource would be AWESOME!!!!Update:I did get Amazon to give me a credit to my account to purchase the book. However, it took a lot of negotiating to do this. Kudos to amazon for rectifying the situation, but you need to update your advertisement on the website for the kindle version and the publisher needs to release the access code so we can take the tests!!"
4,NOTORIOUS,A pretty good film. Didn't know very much about this star except his death. I truly enjoyed this film and especially the musical experience via Blu-ray
4,Very Inspiring!,"This is one of the most inspiring movies I have seen in a while. I thought is was a well balanced story that didn't make Biggie bigger than what he was and also didn't trivialize his legacy. Actually the most interesting character in here was Lil' Kim. I know she has been really upset about how she was portrayed in the film, but I thought the actress, Naturi, really brought the many layers out of Kim and explained her undying devotion to Biggie. Being a filmmaker myself about to release my own project soon, the direction of this film was truly inspiring.-D. Lewiswww.tricksmovie.com"
4,good movie,good movie i like the way they showed the humerous and softer side of biggie and didnt just show him as a gangsta hardcore dude. they brought more of the truth out which is what i like. the acting is really good amd believable.
3,Remarkably Bland,"Others at this site have written solid reviews of this film. They seem to know a lot more about Christopher Wallace (aka Notorious B.I.G.) and his music than I.I found the film entertaining, providing a glimpse inside the hip-hop world of the nineties. It features a lot of Wallace's music, which has sold millions of copies. It provides insight into his life. Raised by his mother in a tough Brooklyn neighborhood, he started dealing drugs in his teens and was incarcerated for nine months for selling crack.The acting was strong, particularly the performance of Jamal Woolard, who portrayed the adult Wallace. But the film does not capture the harsh, confrontational, gritty, and bold spirit that flows from the talented Wallace's music. It seems to have been designed as a tribute to the slain rapper, but comes off as remarkably bland."
3,not as good as I thought it would be,not a bad flick we this teaches me nothing about biggie since I used to be a rap fan since 79 yes my memory is that good an yweay we learn lil kim was a ho before the fame we know big abusede her and faith anyway this proves that big and puff knew who shot pac. we know who killed both pac and big but the law does'nt care to them they was gangster rappers and gang members who got what they deserved anyway puff cashed in on big's fame ever sincve he died and although pac's killer is dead the dudes who shot biggie is still at large and not saying suge knight is responsible for big's death but he knows the killers personally.
3,I love Biggie. But I also love Tupac.,"i felt like this movie was biased and lop-sided. didnt really show any part of tupac's side of the story, and it made him look like the bad guy of the story. also made him look like a b!tch. the real enemy of this story was the bitterness between tupac and biggie because of the media and the whole east coast/west coast rivalry, when in the end, they're all brothers trying to get up out of the ghetto and really weren't as different as they thought."
3,DVD,so far so good. Timing was good on getting it here. Thanks for sending it to me.for being used its ok :)
5,For hiphop fans only,"U'll love this movie for sure if u are a hip-hop fan, otherwise you will hate it and get all confused on whats going on... Great biography in a way... but consider that THIS IS B.I.G FAMILY AND FRIENDS VERSION OF THE STORY... they never contacted 2pac's friends or family to do this... soooo they might have depicted some characters badly... still loved it tho."
2,Product received was not as promised,"The contents of the movie was as advertised. However, when I received my product it was NOT as promised. It was supposed to be a 3-disc set but there were only 2 discs included. How very dissappointing!!"
4,Five scenes in Chinese garden experience,"Five essays collected together with an author's Postscript. Complete English and Chinese texts with 31 illustrations between (not referred to in the English). An extremely rich source text (particularly for designers) marred only by its rambling organisation and lack of a bibliography. The five essays cover, loosely:In-position viewing versus in-motion viewing gardensGarden compositionScenes and their compositionStarting from water and its organizationMotion and repose.It is the allusive, reflective quality of the essays that most resembles the actual experience of a Chinese scholar's garden."
5,Swann in Love,"The CD of the abridgment is well produced, and the narrator excellent. Unfortunately for me I found that Proust is just not to my taste."
2,Leaves out too many drugs,"I am a budding medical transcriptionist, learning the trade. One of the ways I learn is to have good references on hand to look up medical terms and drugs. This book has helped me out perhaps 50% of the time. It simply does not have all the drugs I need. If you are looking for a quick consumer reference, this may be just the thing, but on the other hand, it does not have everything. Look elsewhere for complete information."
5,Great young singer~,"I'm not much for the newer generation, but this girl is great!! Britney, Christina and the rest can go home! Kaci is here to stay!! She's better than any on American Idol!! hope she Keeps up the good work!! Buy this record!"
3,I'm not exactly sure I fully understand whats going on here,"Kaci seems to be trying to go for the teen pop thing which is cool cause she is young and everything. But with an amazing song like ""Intervention Divine"" can she really be considered teen pop? But then the rest is all bubbly and fun sounding. So still I am confused. I don't understand exactly her aim, but I wish her the best of luck in the industry."
1,wait wait wait..,Doesnt Katie Cassidy sing this song too? Why is she singing it. No offense to her or anything beacuse she has a good voice but I think Katie is wayyyyy better and it's her dad's song so i mean she should be able to sing that. I think Katie sings way better than her.
1,not good,"Kaci's album is really bad. I mean, she totally butchered David Cassidy's ""I Think I Love you"". Why did she even do that song? I recommend not buying this CD. It's just not worth the cash."
5,She is FANTASTIC !!,"I think that Kaci is one of the BEST singers ever, she has a awesome voice(Yeah, she really can sing), very nice musics that you can listen at any moment. Her cd I'm Not Anybody's Girl is one of the best on pop music and has fantstic music like: Kiss Me Crazy, Paradise, Beggin' Me and many others that I'm sure you will enjoy it every day, so do some inteligent and buy this album NOW, you will love it, buy her singles too, I'm sure they're fantastic, just like KACI !!!!!"
2,Well...it's better than some Disney...,"One thing for sure is that she definitly has more singing ability and talent than hilary duff, which isn't really saying much actually. It seems very Disney Radio. Paradise was the significant song, but I personally found it annoying. Try Nikki Cleary instead. We will never hear from Kaci again."
3,"Funny, but . . .","All the words to songs on this album are hilarious. Scarytown was my favorite.However, if you're looking for a spooky CD for Halloween night, look elsewhere. The songs range from jazz to super-slow to light rock. A very fun album, but make sure you're aware that not all the songs have a spooky sound to them."
2,Revised? Not really!,"I just received the ""revised"" 1999 version and find it is the 1998 edition (went to press in late 1997). There are NO new schools or NEW degree programs. The old edition was good but it needs to be updated. Get Peterson's at Amazon (updated annually) or Distance Degrees at www.collegeathome.com (updated every six months). Thorson has 31 schools offering MBAs, e.g. Distance Degrees has over 85! Peterson's have over 60. If this book was updated annually it would be great. Good info on too few schools."
4,A must read for advanced and beginner Pike fishermen,I fish for pike every day as a fishing guide. This book will help you understand the life cycle and behavior of Northern Pike. The techniques and Stratigies described in this book will help you become a better and more productive Pike fisherman. Hey It could help you have a better fishing Vacation.
3,Not as good as stock Mach 460 speakers,"From Pioneer's website these are touted as their top model. I'm actually surprisingly disappointed in their quality. After installing the front door speakers, I wanted to hear the difference between the Pioneers and my Mustang's Mach 460 speakers (still in the rear). The Mach's are much better all around, especially their Bass. I've owned top-end pioneers before and were happy with that purchase, but these were disappointing. They are tinny and don't have as much bass as I was hoping for. I bought two pairs and have returned the second, opting to leave the stock speakers in the back."
3,Modest Improvement at Best,I replaced the factory door speakers in my 2013 Boss 302. Given the specifications I was expecting/hoping for a significant improvement in midrange clarity and sharper highs. The difference is marginal.
1,2005 Grand Marquis LS,Well. I got these speakers and took them out the box and they just looked cheaply made. So that afternoon I hooked them up. They sounded good at first but then in the middle of a song the tweeter just fell out and was hanging there. Definitely going to return and go with some better quality speakers. Like MB Quart ONX157's or Infinity Reference 6832cf.
1,not good(can I choose zero stars),The copy of this book I received was not at all what I was expecting. Photocopies of the books original pages is not worth $20. To top it off the person doing the copying must have gotten tired because then he just started taking photos of the books original pages. What a joke. Many pages are not even legible.
5,What a wonderful book!,"It was a sad day when Bloom County and then Outland ended. These are perhaps the best view of the Eighties and early Ninties that can be done with humor. I really enjoyed the last part of the book in which Breathed tells a short story about cartoons that recived special responces from diferant public figures (i.e. President Reagan, Casper Weinburger, Gregory Peck and Spock, yes, as in Mr. Spock!!). I will miss Bill and Opus."
5,If you only read one book in your lifetime...,Reading past Bloom County and Outland strips is like taking a stroll through the political and pop culture landscape of the eighties and early nineties with non-stop laughs and fond memories of the times and of the what is quite possibly the funniest comic strip series ever.
2,Had Potential/Cliches and Secrets Ruined It,"The plot premise had potential - marriage between two strangers. In the hands of a more skilled author, this could have been an excellent book. Unfortunately, the author ruined this book with 'secrets', forced seductions, and cliches. First, Skylar's secret was really lame. It was never believable that she didn't confess all as she grew to know Hawk. Second, I like a forced seduction as much as the next romance reader, but the ones in here were really lame. It was difficult to believe that there was any attraction between the characters at all. Third, Skylar was a really dumb heroine. Why can't this author create a heroine who can get herself out of trouble instead of relying on the hero to do it for her? Just pass on this one."
1,When the hero rapes the heroine...,I always put the book down. The plot had potential but I cannot like a hero like this.
1,DOA,"I have purchased after market batteries before. I know not to expect the battery life to be as long and the overall battery to last as long as the Cannon OEM, but I was not expecting it to be DOA. Maybe not all are like this and I just got one of the defective ones. I will not waste my money and buy another one."
5,A true storyteller,Caryl Phillips knows how to tell a story. He's a citizen of the world and I appreciate his imagination and perspective.
4,Amazing recordings but tracks are mislabeled,"The album is based on recordings made by Katherine Dunham in the 1950s. For people interested in traditional religious music of the African Diaspora this album is an important resource, especially since many styles have changed since she made the recordings. Beware, however! ALL OF THE HAITIAN MUSIC TRACKS ARE MISLABELED.The track labeled Mahi is actually Ibo; the track labeled Petro Kita is actually Yanvalou; The track labeled Ibo is Mahi; The track labeled Yanvalou is Petro.Given the radical differences among these rhythms, it's important to get them right!"
5,Necessary but...,"This compilation, like most of Rhino's power pop/new wave/D.I.Y. compilations adequately picks the most popular songs for that specific era/genre but fails to dig deeper as far as obscure tracks are concerned. While ""What I Like About You"" is a classic tune it's already on Rhino's other compilations, and they could have selected another Romantics song. Once in a while they will surprise me and toss in a lesser-known but well-deserved gem, such as ""Whatever Happened to Fun"" by Candy (and a few others in the D.I.Y. series), but the cynic in me says that it's only because some geek on the Rhino selection team wanted to show how ""hip"" he was and pick some tune he's only read about and for some reason or another be included, but not by any thorough research on the subject matter. Anyway, if you like pop this is a good collection to have if you want some of the classics on one disc."
4,This CD is Nothing to Be Ashamed of,"Great power pop from the decade when that was the genre that never spoke its name. Several of these tracks - ""Whenever You're on My Mind"", ""There She Goes"", ""Behind the Wall of Sleep"", ""Love Is For Lovers"", and, of course, ""What I Like About You"" - pretty much dare you not to sing them all day after you hear them. A few of the tracks just don't click with me, but that's probably me rather than the collection. I'd give it five stars if (as the liner notes sadly point out) an XTC track and ""Pulling Mussels (From the Shell)"" had made it on. Buy it, put it on, and sing along loud enough to drown out your ""cool"" neighbor's snide comments."
4,much better than most of it's type.....,"the included offerings by: great buildings, hoodoo gurus, plimsouls and tommy keene would all make my top 10 for the decade list, with the db's and la's in the top 30. that alone suggests 5 stars.... however, the obligatory inclusion of the pedantic ""what i like about you"" as the opening cut will cost them a star (""when i look in your eyes"", a tastier rendition of the same three chords, would make a more palatable choice). overall, a very credible line-up.note of interest: great buildings became the rembrandts (""friends"" theme fame) in the 90's and you can't help but hear bits of ""i'll be there for you"" in the vastly superior ""hold on to something""."
3,You get what you pay for!,"Pioneer Cdsr100 is a steering remote control unit being sold by Pioneer for more than 9 years now. Yes, because it works well with all units, so there was no need to replace it. I am using it with DEH P-80MP (or P-1Y in Asia) for two years and my experience so far with it is just ok. I like the ease to operate, and its excellent design, but hates when it stops working when your car is parked in sun, or when it is too cold. Still, it is value for money product from Pioneer."
5,Good Remote !,"I've been using this remorefor one month now to control a FHP-4200MP Pioneer Double-DIN Radio/Cass/CD installed at about the 2 o'clock position on the steering wheel of my Toyota Camry XLE It works well and is very convenient. No interuptions regardless of driving conditions. Actually it works as well as the original ""card"" type remote accompaning the head unit."
2,Dont buy it if you are looking for something to attach to the wheel,I bought this about 2 months ago and it does not work if you attach it to the wheel. I always have it detached and that is the only way to use this remote.
1,Doesn't Work on Tacoma Steering Wheel,"Bought a new Pioneer car radio for bluetooth streaming and wanted to add a remote on the steering wheel.I bought the Pioneer Cdsr100 remote and installed it on steering wheel as pictured - it flat out didn't work.It worked ok when I held the remote in front of the radio but not on the steering wheel.At first I thought it was an RF unit so distance didn't matter, but reading reviews here indicates its a LED remote.Doesn't work in my truck and likely a problem when mounting in larger vehicles where the steering wheel is further away from the remote."
1,Doesnt work at all,"Weather I have this remote on the steering wheel or right in front of my aftermarket stereo, it wont do anything. I guess I wrongly assumed there was such a thing as a universal car stereo remote. There was nothing in the directions about syncing this remote up with whatever type of stereo you have. I only read a few reviews before buying this. My mistake because it seems this might only work with Pioneer brand stereos...and even only certain types of Pioneer stereos...after modifications with a drill. Can anyone tell me how to use this with a JVC brand stereo or is it that picky and worthless of a remote?"
1,Poor Performance,"This unit only works 20% of the time in certain position and need to be really close to the radio, i investigate on the internet and many people suggest holes in the unit, even doing that the performance increase like another 20% but still 40% is not the best for something that should work 100% ok. This remote dont worth your time and your money, if you have the regular remote that comes with your radio .. keep using it. That will save you some bad moments and aggravations, angry.. bla, bla, bla.. Resumen... DO NOT buy this thing! is useless!!!!"
3,Need advice,"Please I need every users advice about this unit before i buy it, Does it support the Keenwood Unit ot just Pioners????"
2,Response/Wheel Control,"Service excellentGood selectionsfast deliverPRODUCT !!it work but...seems range is limtedchanged batteriessignal seems to be weak/distance is 2 feet response intermittentmaybe i got a bad one, Pioneeer is a great company.Will continue to do business.chef m"
2,Frustrating,"This thing drives me up a wall ! As another poster said, you have to drill out where the beam comes out, or it won't hit the radio. I actually cut a huge hole exposing both beam bulbs, and it still better used as a hand held remote. I really can't recommend this to a novice. If you're a techie, you can fool around w/ it, and get some functionallity out of it."
1,Totally useless,"Didn't work at all unless I pointed it directly at the headunit and had it turned backwards. Tried drilling holes in it as one reviewer suggested. It helped, but it still has to facing the headunit just right.Total waste of money"
2,It gets loose,"Controls all functions of my unit. The idea of making a remote for the steering wheel is great, however this thing gets a loose and falls very frequently. i do not recommend it."
2,with limitations,"Try to put to a CRV, the position of the radio and after many attempts to address and disarm the sender chooses to signal to the control backwards to make it workI think that whoever designed this control to lack vision to put no signal emitters in various directions, and that according to the car radio will not have the same location as that in the control signal transmitter only bring up only"
3,Product Funtionality Limited.,"I've used this product for a couple of months now, and its an OK product. I had to take it off the steering wheel though, because I hated the feeling something on the wheel. I attached it to the handbrake of my Honda Civic, so the IR LEDs are facing the unit. (Which technically means it upside-down.) Regardless, I have a DEH-P690UB headunit, and the remote does work with it. The bad part about this remote, is you lose most of the features specific to your headunit, because the remote uses the generic IP-Bus interface from Pioneer. A couple of the buttons end up doing nothing. If the headunit is in direct sunlight, the remote doesn't function well, if at all. I bought the remote because of the missing ATT button on my headunit. Needless to say, if I had an ATT button on the faceplate of my headunit, I would not have purchased this product."
2,depends of the car stereo you have,"You must need to check if you pioneer car stereo have and infrared receiver, it dependes the quality, for my pioneer P4000 it didn't work correctly, so you need to put the remote front the car stereo, and has a bad reception when is attached in its base."
1,Useless!!!,completely and utterly useless. to be secured with rubber bands on the rudder of the vehicle is skidding and usually not easy to use. must also be aligned with the radio receiver to go to work.
2,Disapointed,First of all I had to take it apart and drill two holes where the light sensor goes because it would work half the time than I had to hang it upside down and make sure your hand is not in the way for it to work The changeing from Nav to radio will not work the ideia is great but the product as is is poor need big time redraw I finally got it to where I know how to place my hand so as to not block signal and have to remember to operate in reverse other then that good.
4,Works great,In my 2006 PT Crusier the remote works great as long as there is no sun shinning directly on the reciever. My remote has two small straps holding it to the steering wheel not like the one in the photo. Not sure how snug it will stay on the wheel when the weather warms up and the straps get more stretch to them.
3,Not Overly Minty,"While I have several of the Torani brand sugar free syrups at home, and love them all, I would have to say out of all of them, the mint one isn't ""minty enough,"" especially considering I'm using it as an add in to coffees or actual recipes. In short, I find the minty-ness a bit muted and diluted when in a mixed drink.Torani provides a flavorful, sugar-free alternative. All their syrups are of high quality and consistent. But the mint one, IMHO, isn't my favorite, even though I want it to be."
5,"The SACD reissue of Leontyne Price's ""Butterfly""","If your stereo system is sophisticated enough to reveal the differences between CD issues of performances and the SACD reissues of the same material, and if you love Leontyne Price's early performances, then you should rush to get this. (There are 3 other Living Stereo operas now also available as SACDs: ""Turandot,"" ""La Boheme,"" and ""La Traviata."" These are also perfectly gorgeous.) The improvement made by remastering this opera set (and the other three) brings the sound very, very close to that of really good vinyl - but without the surface noise, ticks, and pops."
2,where is the second disc??,"Ok, I got this a while back. I loved it. the sound is incredible and the music, of course as well. Heres the problem. This is a two disc set. Disc one is labeled Act 1 and 2. Disc two is labeled continuation of act 2 and act 3. Disc one is supposed to be 60min and 45 sec. disc 2 is supposed to be 68 min and 44 sec. BOTH DISC ARE THE SAME!!! BOTH READ 60 MIN AND 45 SEC. EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE LABELED ONE AND TWO. THEY ARE THE SAME. I discovered this and sent it back and Amazon was great about replacing the disc. I just received the replacement and it's the same deal! Obviously, the problem goes back to the manufacture, so who do I call now? Beware if you get this and check it out when you receive it."
1,"June 2010, Second Disc Still defective!","Amazing that this has been going on for years. I just ordered this and discovered what others have been reporting - disc 2 is a duplicate of disc 1. I reported it to Amazon and they promptly offered me a refund. BUT...they totally ignored my comments on removing all defective copies from their supply chain. I sent a followup and pressed them on that point, but have not heard back yet. It is sad that this problem could go on for so long."
2,WARNING!!! Check your CDs when you get them!,"I would have given this CD remastered a 6 out of 5 stars, if my CD 2 wasn't a duplicate of CD 1! I didn't bother to read all of the reviews before I purchased this set. I am such a fan of Leontyne Price and RCA Living stereo recordings that when I saw that a remastered Super Audio version was available...well, lets just say that I leaped before I looked. There is a previous review of this set that I did not read, in which the reviewer stated that his CD 2 was exactly like his CD 1. When he got his replacement, the same thing occurred. Well, it has now happened to me and I have no idea where to turn to get the real CD 2.The real shame is that the sound is heavenly. The CDs will not play in a regular CD player. If you have a DVD player that is connected to your stereo system via fiber optic, or digital audio, you are in luck. It doesn't get any better. Well, it does if you have the real CD 2."
1,ACT ONE AGAIN & AGAIN,"I had hoped the issue stated by the other reviewers had been corrected but that is not the case. CD TWO IS A DUPLICATE OF CD ONE. You may read reviews, but clearly AMAZON does not read them. Amazon makes no attempt at offering customer service, just point & click returns, so I could keep returning & returning this CD and never rectify the problem. If I could get a correct copy I would be very happy as CD one is beautiful music."
4,love it!,you would have to buy dozens of individual soundtracks to include even some of the music here. slight adjustment to john williams (for example) originals but well performed. outstanding variety. use these cds to jump start your day with triumph!
2,Volume Levels very erratic,"Great selection of movie themes. Difficult packaging to 'unwrap' Volume levels vary greatly from track to track; some okay; many too soft and you have to constantly adjust the volume levels to hear the tracks. Ultimate for selction of themes, but mediocre for technical execution of such a simple thing as volume control."
3,"Nice Music, Bad Presentation","The music is excellent, but the soft pieces should have been on one (or two) of the CDs with the loud ones on others--I kept having to change the volume all the time, which is tiresome. The talking and lift off sounds as regards Apollo 13 were unnecessary and annoying. I doubt that I would have purchased this set had I been able to hear it all at one time."
5,Relive you movie experiences,"This collection of movie themes, will allow you to relive the chilling experiences from practically all (4 CDs)of the great movies. Great movies would not be great without great music. The Cincinnati Pop with Eric Kunzel are unbeatable recordings. Every minute is more beautiful and inspiring to the next. If you love Pops music, this is the begin all, end all."
4,oh so sad and beautiful...,"Lazarus is dark, but full of imagery and mood you can't help but be drawn in. All the songs are great, and even some of the demos rival the studio versions, but i like both. Just shows what a strong songwriter Trevor really is. The first record took a while to get its hooks in me, but once hooked there's no going back!"
4,Get the download.,"I ordered the Great Speeches CD and got the CD for ""Grimm's Fairy Tales"" instead. There must have been a mix-up at the factory. I guess it's difficult to match-up sleeve and CD.So after this happened to me twice, I decided to download the title. The speeches are excellent and worth listening to. The 18th century Baroque music, however, is really overdoing it and doesn't fit in with early 17th century Shakespearean drama."
3,pretty good,heavy has been up&down with his work but he comes off surprisingly well on this disc.it's a pretty good disc in 99 would have been cutting edge in 89.but heavy is tuff enough to last.and he still has skills.he is also good at finding unknown talent and can definitely drop some flavor to someone elses track.this disc doesn't sound commercial.for me it was different from the usual heavy.
1,"NEEDS TO HANG IT UP,LOVE YAH STILL!","IT JUST ISNT HARD HITTING AND PARK PUMPING LIKE HE USED TO BE. ""DONT YOU KNOW"" IS STILL MY FAVORITE SONG OF ALL TIME, SO YOU ARE A STILL A LEGEND BUT LET REDMAN,METHOD MAN,AND JAYZ,DMX TAKE OVER AND STAY BEHIND THE SCENES."
4,Should be good!,"After talking with heavy D in chat room last night, It looks like this one is gonna be big for him. The guests he got on this album should really back him up. He is one old-school rapper I like as far as his style. he dosen't pretend to be anything and for that I give him major props. He will hold it down along with all the other big kyats in the game(Jay-z,busta,bigpun,dre,JD,etc..)I will be checking this one out next week.Can't give it five yet, but he deserves 4 just for the first single I heard."
3,time to retire,"heavy's trying to cash in and had q tip, 8 ball, and bug pun on here and this cd still did'nt sell heavy's time came and went still deserves 3 stars because he's a legend."
2,Some funny stuff/Bad sound quality,Definitely a 'home made' production.DVD suffers from poor sound quality.If you are Guyanese you will probably enjoy this.If not you may be left scratching your head (what did he say?)
1,DOA,"Defective Product,Upon arrival I first noticed the inside memory package was not factory sealed or(tampered proofed). There were also stickers that had been partly removed from the plastic static packaging. With this Indication I believe this product had been previously opened or used and returned to the supplier defective then resold threw your web site.I hope this was not the case, I was not purchasing used memory.This product has been sent back for a replacement."
3,Very carasmatic but good,"This book is different. i enjoy it, but struggle with the spirit led/ carasmatic apporach to ministry."
5,Carrom the game everyone should own!,I remember playing this game as a kid at grandma's house with all of my family members. It is a very simple game that does not take much space to play and is extremely fun. I would highly recommend this game to anyone of all ages. It takes a little bit of skill and is kinda like playing pool. The quality of the boards are as good today as they were fifty years ago. I have recently purchased a board at an antique store that is over 100 years old it is a little more fancy than the boards today but the quality has not changed at all. If you have never played then I highly recommend giving it a shot. You can not beat the price and it is tons of fun for both family and friends.
3,it's ok but not great,"because it's so many games in one this board is a bit confusing. also, they do not provide you with extra pieces so if you lose a piece the game is done."
3,Not one of our favorites,"This game is ok. Playing with the wooden sticks can be tricky to master, and it's very frustrating when you want to hit the pieces hard. We rarely use the sticks when playing. Flicking them with your fingers works great, but stings!Not one of our favorite games, plus the board is huge, and takes up a lot of space."
5,Bustin out!!!,"This item brings back a lot of old memories for me, and so when a friend saw my board she freaked out as she had not seen it in years. i gave it to her for her b day and she loved it!"
4,GREAT PRODUCT,"Got this as a Christmas gift and they loved this product. The only diadvantage I have with this product is, the board is too small. The advantage is there are so many games on just one product...and it works great. The receiver loved it."
3,"Great game, always broken","Carrom is a fantastic game! With that being said, they need to figure a better way to ship. Over time I've ordered 4 carrom boards and all have been broken upon arrival. They seem to get dropped on the corner and need a few repairs with tape"
3,A little disappointed,I grew up with this game the board was made of wood and beatuifully painted. The sticks looked like pool ques not just stick with no shape to them. Was a little disappointed.
4,Carrom,Carrom board has many possible board games some of which entail action. This product has been around for at least 40 years and continues to provide entertainment for the whole family.
3,carrom board,"The first board sent fell apart - literally, but Amazon replaced it with no hassle and in record time. The second board was fine and we are enjoying it as much as we used to back in the 60's. It's a fun, family game that you don't have to plug in or buy upgrades for. .sort of refreshing these days. Highly recommend it for those who have never played it."
5,Carrom Game Board,Ordered this last minute for a Christmas gift and it came in time! Very happy with product and service.
2,Disappointing,"I was very excited to receive this game, it sounded so great. But when the box arrived and I opened it, I was very disappointed. The pieces are made of cheap plastic and the sticks are just wooden dowels. This may have been a great game at one time, but today the materials are not high quality."
4,carrom board,"Board needed to be glued together. Came apart getting it out of the packaging. Other than that, it was fine."
3,Carom Board,Love the board except the nets in the corner pockets are too loosely tied to prevent the pieces from falling through
4,Sinatra: Vegas (Box Set),Gtreat Set of Sinatra songs. The only problem was the way the songs were edited. The abrupt ending of some of the songs was very distracting and somewhat irritating and amateur. It would be nice if I could order just the DVD. The people I showed it to would to have a copy.Wallace K. Crane
5,ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!!!!,Words alone cannot describe how wonderful this box set is!!!!...The CDs and the DVD give you the ultimate performer Francis Albert Sinatra at his best...singing and entertaining live in Vegas...A must have for any music fan...GREAT SET...
5,Sinatra Swings,"Any Sinatra fan knows he is at his best in front of a live audience.Well, this is no exception.Watch his ""Maybe this time""He is the BEST of the best !Bobbygallo"
5,"Sinatra: Vegas (Box Set, 4CD/1DVD)","CD's wonderful (haven't viewed DVD yet). Very interesting comments in booklet included with the Box Set, by Sinatra children and various individuals who had the opportunity to work with Frank Sinatra at the Las Vegas venues."
4,sinatra:vegas box set,"What can I say??????/ this is a great collection, the remastered sound is pretty good, considering the tapes are of an old tec. the only thing that would make it better, is if you could do with todays high tec recording."
2,Sinatra on stage,"Very disappointed w/album. Band much too loud, overpowered Sinatra & his swearing was just too much. I've always enjoyed all of Sinatra...he's very special. But this was certainly a big disappointment."
3,Not what advertised,The cd's are great and so is the quality. However it was advertised as never before heard shows. I had heard almost all of the and except for (and I mean just this) a WORD here and there it was all done before.
1,I HAVEN'T RECEIVED MY PACKAGE!!,"ON NOVEMBER 17, 2006, I ORDERED FROM YOUR WEBSITE THE FRANK SINATRA BOX SET OF 4 CDS AND 1 DVD, AND IT WAS PROMPTLY SHIPPED TWO DAYS AFTER, ON NOVEMBER 19.ALMOST TWO MONTHS HAVE PASSED AND AMAZON ALREADY CHARGED THE PAYMENT TO MY CREDIT CARD, BUT THE PACKAGE STILL HASN'T ARRIVED, EVENTHOUGH IT WAS SUPPOSED TO ARRIVE BY DECEMBER 29TH, AT THE LATEST.WHAT HAPPENS NOW? DO I HAVE TO KEEP WAITING ETERNALLY FOR MY PURCHASE? WHO ANSWERS FOR THIS? IS THERE A CLIENT SERVICE I CAN REACH? A PHONE NUMBER OR DIRECT EMAIL?FRANCISCA JIMÉNEZ NORTHCOTE"
5,log presents a great cd it rocks like good sex,yes the husband and wife team of steve and terry terror rock so hard that you come running. dupre says it knocked my socks off! they really sock it to you with dodge and burn. all the songs will have you tuned in the fantastic futuristic dreambox scapes of sonic molten core samples. this cd is always out of its case and in my player 5 stars *****
2,Wasted money!,"Although this charger was received in good shape, and looks and feels very durable and solid, it will not charge my phone. When I plug it into the phone, the phone just says ""Unauthorized Charger"" across the screen, and doesn't charge. Would have been nice to know that ahead of time."
4,Retractable Car Charger,"Bought this as a replacement for a similar charger. Works well, was shipped quick and the price was great. Cord doesn't retract as well as my previous one, but it serves its purpose."
4,FUN,"My cat Blu loves these. Somehow I found one around the house and he so much loved to toss it in the air and chase after it. It was tough to keep finding the ""one"" we had so I ordered more (2x4 pack). It took a very long time to get them but quite frankly I could not find them anywhere else!"
5,To the Station,This albun of Blindside is also brilliant ........ see my comments on the Messenger of the Blues C.D.
5,Sexy and Energetic,"What an uplifting CD! If you ever need some music to give you energy, to make you feel better, or to just set the mood if need be. I have enjoyed burlesque music for a while now mainly becuase of its intelligent blend of spunk, attitude, energy and sheer sexuality. My personal favorite track on this CD is the Shivas Regal song which i first heard in a preformance by Dita Von Teese. Now if you're thinking 'this isnt my thing' or you just 'don't listen to that kind of music' well you might surprise even yourself. If a 15 year old listener of death metal like myself can enjoy this album, who's saying you cant?"
5,"Cocktails, anyone?","This is THE CD to accompany your fabulous cocktail-parties.The music is glamourous, funny and packed with attitude. I can't really see anyone ""take it off"" to this stuff though, unless you've already emptied every bottle you own. A couple of the last tracs are a surprise, as they have more of a ""Pulp Fiction""-edge to them, but the rest is pure retro fun, conjouring up images of Tempest Storm strutting her stuff. And of course, every serious bombshell has the legendary ""The Stripper"" in her collection. Delight any audience with this show-stopper. If you're able to do a routine to this classic without smiling, you need help. Ditto your audience."
3,Good enough,"This collection is fun, but I was a little disappointed. It's not as gripping as those Betty Page collections (who knows if they're available anymore) -- it doesn't make one want to stand up and start stripping. Not that I strip -- I'm just sayin'. This disc is a little bland, but it's still awesome this kind of stuff is available."
3,Strip Tease Classics,"The first time I listened to this CD, I wasn't very impressed. But, after listening to it a few more times, some of the tracks began to grow on me. It's definitely the classic burlesque sound I was looking for, very classy - nothing like the beat-heavy songs of modern strip tease. Basically, think Betty Paige, Dita Von Tease, or Vienna Le Rouge. It's great for cocktail parties, with a wonderful vintage sound."
5,Incredibly Insightful,"This book gives one of the most realistic perspective on adoption from a mothers perpspective that I've ever read. The only people who seem to benefit from adoption are the people who adopt, they lose nothing and no one. Death by Adoption has been saying truthful about the Emporer's new clothes for a long time. One of the few books to show adoption from the point of view of those who lose their family to adoption. A must read!!!!"
3,Edwin Drake should be rewarded,Very good book for children in middle school and beyond. Well written and illustrated. Was written well before oil became the great evil industry it has become today. If you are looking for the environmental side of the oil business this book is not for you.
2,"""Cave Girl"" (1985)","plot outline:in search of the ""perfect"" woman, a bumbling anthropology student accidently travels back in time 25,000 years, and meets his dream woman...a beautiful cavegirl.But she quickly makes it clear he must use all of his modern-day wiles if he is to win her love."
2,B-,"The IMDB site currently shows a rating of '3.1' for this film, which is about what it deserves. The only value I could find was in Cynthia Thompson as the cave girl, Eba. Her raw beauty and innocence reminds me of the lead girl in other, far better films, such as One Million years B.C. and The Time Machine (1960). I mean really, there's nothing to like about the protagonist. With that ridiculous hat and tie, he's like a big doofus version of a young Indiana Jones, trying to act as if he's in a ROTN film. I'm not saying I don't like this film, just that it doesn't offer much in terms of the main character or story, when compared with other B-level movies. I'll probably hang onto it, for the sake of it's 80's appeal and for Cynthia, but I was really hoping for more."
4,not just a cheesey boob flick,"I guess you could say this is one of those cheesy movies of the 80's where they threw in some naked girls for no reason to attract some what of a teenage audience to it.However, this one is not as cheesy as you'd think.Rex is a student who studies archeology, and is pretty much the stereotype geek of movies. On a field trip to a cave, he takes a wrong turn and finds these unusual crystals in a cave and when he touches them, he finds himself in the cave man era.He meets Eba, a cave girl. And he teaches her some modern day things, words and spends most of the movie trying to get her into bed while having to deal with other cave men and women who seem to bumble up all his efforts to score with Eba.It sounds cheesy, but it's actually pretty funny, and memorable. I first saw it 20 odd years ago, and my father in his 60's even still likes it.It's not quite a family sort of comedy, but it's worth the small price they ask for it.no bonus features, no subtitles, just a trailer."
3,Just A Fun B Movie,"""Cave Girl"" is just a fun, no brainer, relaxing B movie with a little nudity. Cindy Ann Thompson, the naked cave girl, is about as cute as they come and can be my cave girl anytime. This movie works for those nights when you just want to plop in front of the TV and not have to think about a thing. Isn't that what B movies are for? Enjoy!"
5,enjoyed It,I been trying to get this movie for sometime. I really enjoyed after I recieved it. It was in excellent condition and i got it in a timely manner. Thank You Ben
3,"Good, but needs updating & improving","It's handy, but a little old and too brief with important parts left out. It needs to be updated and improved. Ie: The admin commands are poorly covered. Do not use this book to help you use Grant or Revoke. The Grant All section is simply wrong."
5,Explanations are accompanied by tables and examples for maximum efficiency.,"George Reese's MY SQL POCKET REFERENCE 2ND EDITION covers Version 5.1 and provides SQL statements, functions, and insights into its variations and utilities. Explanations are accompanied by tables and examples for maximum efficiency."
1,Why are these listed under WOMEN's clothing?!?!?!?,Why are men's disturbing thongs listed under WOMEN's clothing?!?!? I did NOT want to look at this! Please file it accordingly.
5,Great notepads!,Great for jotting notes. They don't work great with some fountain pen inks. Noodler's inks write excellently on them though.
5,Jon Hassell,Having received the CD right on time i like to say it is allays a pleasure to listen to Jon Hassell what ever CD it is - since the CD hard to get here i used an American Supplier with very satisfactory results
4,King successfully jumps genres.,"Like the short story ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,"" Dolores Claiborne is more of a character piece than a horror novel. It invites us to get to know the titular character and her strange and interesting life. For fans of King's horror, this may be disappointing, but it still makes for an engrossing read.King being King, after all, the book can't be all rural Maine slice-o-life. It centers around Dolores' confession of a murder she may or may not have comitted, and around a day when a solar eclipse gave her a glimpse of someone else's life (mirroring a similar scene in Gerald's Game). Though the story is told in flashback, King creates admirable suspense.Above all, though, read this for Dolores' point-of-view narration. It's not Pet Sematary, but it's a heck of a read."
5,No monsters for a change...,"Dolores Claiborne is an interesting change from Stephen King's usual style. His skillful use of the local dialect is important in setting the scene, which itself is unusual for a King novel, for it is not surreal. In fact, this is the only King story I have read that could actually have happened (and I'm sure it has before). A magnificent piece of writing."
4,Great read!,"I read this after reading ""Gerald's Game"" and was pleasantly surprised to find that they compliment each other. You don't have to read them in sequence, but King does a great job of tying characters and happenings together on Little Tall Island. I would not watch the movie, ""Dolores Claiborne"", because after seeing the preview it appears to not follow the novel's plot line very well. Dolores is an interesting character, another example of a strong, intelligent woman who admits to having made mistakes but is ready to face up to the consequences. I enjoyed this book and I think you will too."
4,Very different than all other King's writings,I loved the movie very much hence I read the book. There are differences but both are outstanding. This is very different than all other Stephen King's books. It is not horror. More of drama but very well written and you would dive deep into the book and with the character Dolores. Great reading
4,Huzzah to the reader!,"This audio book sounds like non-fiction because of the voice and superb delivery of Ms. Sternhagen...very well done! The fun of this story is in the idioms and down-to-earth parlance of Delores, the main character. Mr. King spins a painful yarn of strong love and hate around two super ornery women whose lives intertwine in a countrified setting. Although money sets them apart on the social scale, they are sisters in spirit. The devices he used to reveal the conscience of these haunted women was almost a subplot. This is a juicy story that has most of the elements of a daytime soap but is still disturbingly realistic. Loved it!"
4,Stephen King Takes Us On A Character Study Ride,"Once you get used to the broken English of Delores Caliborne, you can really get into this book. I'll admit I was a bit skeptical at first having just read Gerald's Game (which came out right before this and is briefly linked during the solar eclipse scene) and thinking to myself ""Oh, Jesus, another chick book by Steve-O! What's he thinking?"" Well...Delores Claiborne is a chick book, and she is one tough chick. Not a horror novel at all (that shouldn't worry any real Stephen King afficionado, anyway) Delores Claiborne is a rambling auto-biography of a salt-of-the-earth, tough-as-nails housekeeper who killed off her husband 30 some odd years ago. This is a trip into the human psyche. A brilliant character sketch. This is Stephen King showing us why he is one of the greatest writers of all time. Story. Pure and simple. Ayuh.Dig it!"
1,BORING!!!,"I was very disapointed with this book. I have been a BIG King fan for years and this is his' worst!! I hate to give my all-time favorite author a 1 rating but he deserves it, he can definately do better. The story is boring and hard to understand. Not horror at all just mystery. Let's stick to horror Mr. King. Mystery is your wives' gift, let her write the mysteries."
1,Witness the fall of a great writer,"This book was just the beginning of the ride down the slope. Boring, boring, boring. And the movie was boring too! The name of the author was the only thing to carry it through. The plot was lousy, what little there was of it."
1,NOT UP TO SNUFF,stephen king is one of my favorite authors. having read the rest i will atest this is indubitibly the opposite of his best. if i could rate lower than one it would get it. yeech! yes this book makes my skin crawl for all the wrong reasons. i see many like new copies for a penny; don't waste your precious copper!
4,Dolores Claiborne,"Is a gripping book about a hard working, hard talking woman who one day decides she will know longer take the abuse in her life any longer. I usually do not like to read Steven King books but this one I highly recomend to anyone who likes to read geat story telling."
4,Mysterious & heartbeaking,"The story is more dramatic & mysterious than frightful. SK can truly write! Frankly speaking, I prefer his style in stories like Dolores, Green Mile & Misery,than those gory skin creeping ones."
4,"Very good - Ties with "" Rose Madder""","It's a lovely book, told by a woman, where King explores the feminine side of life. Once again, the Master proves that he's much more than a ""spooky writer"". If you liked ""Dolores Claiborne"" you'll love ""Rose Madder""."
5,Brilliant Writing,"Usually I cannot stand Stephen King's stories but was talked in to reading Dolores Claiborne. What a brilliant piece of writing, the insight he has into a tormented woman's mind, rare (I think) in stories by male writers. This is a unique story but if one is looking for the macabre it is not for you, it is a story of the life many woman have to suffer. Rivetting reading."
4,Dolores St. George,"""Dolores Claiborne,"" a gripping suspense novel by Stephen King, is a very enjoyable book. It is told in first person by Dolores Claiborne herself as she delivers a monologue of sorts to the police 30 years after she killed her husband and 2 days after Vera Donovan, her employer, died. The page is a brief 368 pages with four pages of a scrapbook of artificial newspaper articles. A must read."
4,An Interesting and Unique Story by Stephen King,"I found this novel by MR. King to be absolutely wonderful. It was so interesting to read and the well written story was very unique. This book is not frightening like many of the author's stories, but it still keeps an overwhelming spookiness about its tale. The story looks into emotional bond between two different women and their lives that are betrayed by violence, abuse and many other emotional problems. This is a strong and emotional story that is well worth your time. Highly recommend for your reading pleasure."
2,Not so hot,"Hmm. I was expecting a good deal from this book--both from the critical acclaims on the jacket promising something really special and the interesting idea of having the narrative as Dolores's monologue interview with the police. But it's nothing really special--Dolores is quite a funny character, and Vera Donovan's quite good too, but as a whole it's like an overblown version of one of the many subplots King plants in his other bigger novels (""It"", ""Needful Things"" etc.). Hardly engaging, and definately not frightning--except to show that even a good author like King can stoop to such levels."
3,READ ANY OTHER KING BOOK,"This was the most boring stephen king book that i have read. there is about 400 pages, and at about 15 pages i was board. It just goes on and on. the movie is not that good but it still was a lot better than the book. i have read about 20 of king's books and this was the only one i did not like. He's still the best"
3,Raunchy,"Two biddies at war with each other, and an abusive husband--hard to stomach. However, this does get better as the plot unfolds. It loosely parallels Poe's Cask of Amatillado. The main character is one strong-willed woman. But pretty yucky. Have Tums at hand with this one."
4,Praise for Stephen King's Dolores Claiborne,I read this book in about a week last summer. It truly touched my heart. The message I got is that sometimes we have to rely on people outside of our families to survive. I cried often reading this book because I found the characters to be so moving and life like. For instance when Mrs. Donnovan counsels Dolores about her marriage problem. I am a big Stephen King fan and a big Lifetime movie fan so I guess you could say this was the best of both worlds LOL.
4,Enjoyable but not King's better books,"Dolores Claiborne, is a book that brings out a humourous, though violent perspective on life. Even though it is not King's normal line of horror, it is quite good."
3,A Scarey book for men,"Stephen King explores the dark side of the female in this novel . For one reason or another plots of reprisals and murders unfold - slowly it evolves as we discover more about the characters and their pasts. Discovering more - as the characters do about one another and by quiet understanding we realise the dark side of a woman scorned. It is scary that behind an innocent patient female fasade can be a cold calculating killer - in any woman who is opressed, threatened and pushed to the limit."
4,Dolores Claiborne Book Reveiw,"The book I choose was Dolores Claiborne by Steven King. There are 368 pages. The important characters in this boook were Dolores, Vera Donovan, and Joe (Dolores's husband) The story takes place in the pretty recent times. The setting is in Maine. The plot of the story is that Dolores killed her husband and was accused for killing Vera Donovan her employer. I think that the ""golden line"" or ""the line i wished i had said"" is ""Jeezly-crow you never shook the ants out of your pants have you?"" On page 24. It really has nothing to do with the story but i think that its a neat line. The cover of this book is showing a house which represents Vera Donovans house. Then the title ""Dolores Claiborne"" has an obvious meaning because she is the narater of this story telling her life. I would rate this book probably an eight out of ten. I would recommend this book definately because it was a very interesting book very creative and i could hardly put it down!"
2,Dull Reading Ahead,"I am somewhat of a King fan, and I am a fan of more literary fiction, but the two just don't work in the same book. This is a confession of an old woman named Dolores Claiborne (hence the tittle.) The story takes forever to develope and leads up to only one or two relatively exciting but brief scenes. There are no chapter breaks, meaning you'll have to pick your own place to stop--given the choice I ended up reading only a page or two at a time which drug out the slow reading even longer. It just wasn't worth it.The one plus: yes, he does write about women very well, but that fact alone does not make a good book. You need more than great characterization. You need great characterization, plot, narrative flow/pacing, prose, and interest-holding. One out of six just doesn't do it."
2,"Story is Awesome, narrator is not","Stephen King does not disappoint in this audio cd BUT, the narrator really sucks. She is the sheriffs wife (sorry cant think of her name and I already got rid of the cd's) her voice is annoying after about 30 minutes. I have both the book and the movie but could not take the narration in the cds. I was really disappointed. Granted I am spoiled because Frank Muller really is the only narrator that was ever really able to bring out the creepy-ness of King's stories. I would have preferred they try to get a narrator that does not sound like a they are 1,0000 years old and a deeper pitch to their voice."
1,What is the craft of writing coming to?,"I have been a long-time fan of Steven King's and make it a point to read all his books. But, Jesus, Mary and Joseph!! What was this book? Sure, the concept was intriguing, which is why I bothered to buy the book. The writing?? Dull-witted and far too conversational. Some may mistake Dolores' rambling monologue as character development, I saw it as one really played-out soliloquy. This confessional mode that King chose for this book really seems like an out from doing the hard work himself. The language level was atrocious: barbaric, stupid: the kind that appeals only to goons, idiots and, apparently, Americans(Canadians are Americans, too, genius). I scoff on the term Best Seller. As far as I'm concerned, it means beans."
1,I hated this booked. My least favorite ever.,"This book was pathetic. Probably his worst. Don't read thisbook, it should be banned from shelves. I really wasted mymoney with this one"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"This is a story about two deaths. Dolores Claiborne is the housekeeper for a wealthy lady, and the police are investigating her death.There is the killing of a husband in the past, and the police suspect Dolores of causing this death, as well. The novel then goes into the backstory of the relationship between the two women, and what is really going on."
2,Disappointing.,"Although I liked Elspeth very much I found Alex to be pretty much a selfish creep. In fact I really didn't care that much for any of the male characters. Also Alex switches for a revenge seeking creep to an obsessed lover seeking to rekindle the flame he shared with Elspeth in Scotland in little less than a paragraph. I may read other Tallchief stories if I come across them, but they aren't high on my must read list. Disappointing."
3,Not the best,"My daughter will not listen to this cd at night. The only one that she will fall asleep to is ""Wonder Kids: Lullabies for Little Angels"". I think Tina Malia has a very pretty voice but all her songs sound the same, her pitch never changes which is kind of annoying."
1,Didn't Like It,"I bought this lullaby collection based on the recommendations of other reviewers. I am not a fan of the singer's voice. It is way too high for my taste. My son doesn't seem to like it, either, and will not fall asleep to this CD. He prefers the Disney Lullaby Collection instead."
5,Kids favorite bedtime music,"Used this as our bedtime routine for our children and my oldest is 11! She still requests it on some nights when she needs comfort. Soothing and easy, nothing fancy, everything low key, EXACTLY what we need in this day and age!"
5,I thought I wouldn't find another,"I purchased this CD in 2003 right before my daughter was born. I also purchased ""Golden Slumbers: A fathers lullaby"" which I also highly recommend. I was pregnant and the CD wasn't my favorite at first--largely because of Tina's voice. I would describe it as ""sweet"" and pretty, but perhaps plain. Like many others after my daughter was born and over the next couple of years it became her very favorite. Maybe it was the songs, (her favorite, ""Dark Brown is the River"") maybe it was the simplicity of the songs, who knows. The last couple of years the CD has gone missing. The other night my now 5-year old asked me to sing her lullabies and I started with some from this CD. I was so happy to see it still available and have reordered it. $6.25?! Wow. Cheap. I would now describe Tina's voice as pure and simple. We like it."
2,I'm not a fan,"I saw so many good reviews, I thought I was sure to like this lullaby CD for my daughter. But I'm not a fan of Tina Malia's voice. She sounds exactly the same for all the songs with the same pitch, so that I feel like I'm listening to annoying elevator music. I also thought some of the songs were odd choices. Anyway, I can see others like this CD, but I just can't stomach it. Only reason I gave it more than 1 star is because it doesn't seem to annoy my daughter the way it does me!"
4,Our 4-month old loves it!,"This is the only CD we can use to get our son to fall asleep. Plus, we love the music too! The version of Summertime is as good or better than any one I've heard (and I own at least 6 different versions)."
5,Perfect lullabies,"My son has gone to sleep with these lullabies every night since birth (he's now 18 mos) and they still do the trick. The CD is the perfect length. We have tried changing to another CD, but keep coming back to this one."
5,I'm on my second CD,"I just purchased my second copy of this CD, as my son and I have worn it out after 2 and a half years of use. He's in a big boy bed, but he still likes his ""night night music"". We even take it with us when we travel."
5,SIMPLY...BEAUTIFUL !,"I really like it! The singer has such a beautiful voice & the music is excellent! I knew some of the lullabies on the CD, but when I heard them this time -from Tina Malia -they all sounded ... magical! (especially Twinkle Twinkle Little Star)"
5,A Top Pick of Bookclub magazine and deserves it!,"Castle Rouge is a breathtaking work of depth and quality. Never has Irene been so fascinating or determined, and never has she found herself in a situation to match this one. This is a sumptuous read!"
2,Weak follow-up to Chapel Noir,"What a disappointment this book turned out to be. With the cliffhanger ending of the excellent Chapel Noir, I'd been waiting for months to see what would happen next. Will Irene Adler catch Jack the Ripper? Will she rescue Nell? Who IS Jack the Ripper? Now that I've read the book, all I can say is, ""Who cares?""Weak writing, an endless parade of famous personalities of the late 1800's cluttering up the plot, and other improbable (silly) subplots thrown in the mix just plain ruined the fun.Bottom line: skip this one. Maybe Ms. Douglas can try again later."
2,Disappointing,"Slow, confusing, not very believable, (and to top it off Pink is beyond irritating). I was very disappointed in this installment in the Irene Adler series. As a long time fan I have been quite disappointed in the last two books"
4,Simple to Prepare and Oh How Tasty The Results!,"I bought this book a few years ago after seeing Joanna demonstrate some of the recipes on a shopping network. I was impressed with the simplicity of the recipes and the author's promise that every ingredient could be found in her small town supermarket. To say that I haven't been disappointed is an understatement. This is the book I reach for when I need something quick to prepare but tasty nevertheless. I have grown my collection of Joanna Lund books to eight, and my experience with this first volume is the primary reason for the expansion.Give this book a try. Your family will be pleased and so will you."
3,"Simple, fairly tasty, low-fat dishes","I'm using this cookbook to help me learn how to ""low-fat-ize"" my cooking. I like that Lund uses everyday ingredients and tells you up front what you need to keep on hand to cook from her book on short notice. The recipes are pretty easy to make and, while they'll never be four-star fare, are adequate for Tuesday night meals for the family.I do have one quibble: Most of the recipes that use ground beef call for only 8 ounces. This usually requires that I saw a pound block of hamburger in half, which I find really annoying. It's enough to make me make double batches and freeze the rest."
4,It was good but unrealistic...,"Having been a fan of the Edding's since a teen, I was somewhat dissapointed with <i>Regina's Song</i>. While the story was good, there was a significant amount of undone research - the kind that provides the fine details that make a story, a suspense story in particular, that much more enjoyable. In particular, the character development (the hero and his crew, in particular) was a little lacking and there were a lot of loose ends that either needed to be flushed out a little more or left alone in the first place.While the story left a little to be desired, it was still a wonderful read and it was captivating. As a NW native, it is nice to read a story based in my own back yard."
1,wasted potential,"the idea behind this book is very interesting, however, Eddings has to bog it down with his ""clever"" dialogue. THere are characters who serve no function in the book than to allow themain character to showoff his witty banter. Which isn't as witty as it is annoying. All the characters use the same expressions and add ""ie"" to everything, like bugsies and normies etc. which doesnt reflect the dialouge of today in any way shape or form even tho it has a modern setting. Also, the living arrangments Mark finds himself in, just doesn't exsist. No busy college women would cook and clean a house for men, they would either hire someone to do it or expect everyone to clean up after themselves. This out of date sterotyping was extremely annoying and hard to believe. I doubt that this book would have been published had the famous Eddings' had not been the authors."
1,Don't Waste Your Time!,"I have read, and loved, every fantasy book David Eddings has written. Ignoring the tepid reviews, I bought this book and looked forward to another (albeit different) Eddings adventure. Sadly, I was bored to tears by the wooden characters and their elementary school dialogue. I didn't care about any of these people and most of what happened made no sense. I'm usually sorry to see a book end, but this time I was thankful when I finally turned the last page. Personally, I think David Eddings should stick to fantasy and leave murder mystery/thrillers to the experts."
2,The Case of the Overlooked Dental Records,"I was looking forward with great interest to this thriller, being a great fan of the Eddings' highly-readable fantasy novels.Unfortunately, I found Regina's Song highly implausible. The cutesy-poo dialogue of the opening chapters came straight out of a 1940s children's adventure story. The novel is set in the 1990s. Do teenagers and 25-year-olds really speak this way? I think not.And then there's the major plot device - the seemingly impossible problem of identifying whether Regina or her twin sister Renata has been murdered - they're identical and don't have fingerprints or footprints to identify them.Come on, that's no problem at all. The newspapers are always full of bodies being identified by . . . dental records. But David & Leigh Eddings ignore this option, because the entire plot hinges on not being able to identify the dead twin.Some good woodworking tips in the novel, though . . ."
2,"Interesting plot, horrible dialogue","The authors had all the right material to start with, but the ""cutsie"" prose has me praying for a quick ending. Why are graduate students talking like 8th graders?"
3,Very unique.,"I read this book years ago. I enjoyed it at the time, though I would not call it spectacular."
3,Not the Eddings you're used to...,"Do not buy this if you are looking for David and Leigh Eddings' typical fantasy story. This book is not the Eddings that you've gotten accostomed to from the Belgariad or his other series. In Regina's Song, David and Leigh Eddings bring to bear their considerable story telling talents to a modern day thriller. This book is a fast read and I found it very enjoyable. The story is fast paced and well thougth out, with a twist at the end which will keep the reader guessing for at least a couple of days. The characters are well developed if slightly uninteresting. All in all, this is a good diversion."
1,"Intriguing idea, bad science and bad writing","Sure, the idea was interesting, but the writing was bad (as most reviewers have noted) and the references to science was also groan inducing. The aforementioned reference to dental records (to determine which twin survived), the idea that multiple personality disorder actually occurs (it doesn't), and the description of a poison (which doesn't just paralyze, it also kills becuase of paralyzation).Unfortunately, this books was groan-inducing."
1,Regina's Song,"I wasted my time reading this book. It was a lot of useless words for a really terrible story. I don't know in what genre I would place it because it certainly wasn't a thriller, nor a mystery in the usual sense, nor a character study. I thought it was awful, and I was very disappointed."
1,What the Hell?,"I have been a fan of David Eddings' BELGARIAD for years and years, so I was thrilled when I saw his name on a new book. Big disappointment. Words cannot describe how big a disappointment this book was. But I still read all the way to the last sentence, like someone who is unable/unwilling to look away from a car wreck.The premise is that one of a pair of identical twins is murdered and they cannot tell which twin is which, because identical twins have the same DNA. Nice, but I've got two words for you:DENTAL RECORDS. I think it is statistically impossible for even identical twins to have identical cavities, tootbrush wear patterns, etc."
1,Awful!,"This book is truly terrible, like the rest of Eddings' recent works.I can't believe this worthless fool was one of my favorite authors at one point."
1,A huge disapointmen,"I have enjoyed all of Eddings earlier works but this book is a disgrace. A step away from his usual fantasy, this novel takes place in Seattle where a string of violent crimes are being comitted. The charecters in this book are incredibly 2 dimensional and all the dialogue is laced with ""cute"" phrases and witticisms. Also disgusting is theobvious conservatism of the athor that is continuously injected into the book. Don't buy it and don't read it!"
1,What happened?,"I don't understand...I have loved all of David Eddings books. For some reason, now his wife name is added to the title and his writing has lost it's charm? Or maybe he ran out of ideas. Whatever, his last few books have been very disappointing."
4,This grows on you,"This album is very, very good, but it didn't make that much of an impression on me when I first played it - I felt it sounded familiar. But I'm glad I didn't let that scare me away from this superb disc! As when I listened to it for the second time, I discovered the great songwriting, and fine crafted lyrics. Soak Me, You, Overloading God, they're great songs, and Julia sings them with passion, her voice fits the songs perfectly. I hope she gets her break in Europe soon, so I can catch her live."
4,A good album...,This is a good female vocalist with some catchy songs and a little pop with edge. I think she stand well on her own and would recommend this...
5,Pleasantly Surprised,In a word...Amazing!! Touching and emotional. Every song has depth and feeling. Julia has a hauntingly beautiful voice - and lyrics that are personal and thought provoking. I would definetly give this remarkable cd a listen - you won't be sorry!
3,Someone to watch/listen for/to...,"Julia Darling appeared at Joyous Lake, Woodstock NY last night 7/15/99. I had the pleasure of being there and was engaged. She is not a copycat of the Lilith Fair or any other fair. She is an original that shares the move that we have come to call spirit. Her work is a response to it. It is a genuine search for form in the musical medium to describe an abstract. Hardly someone or something to shrug off. There is a disciplined voice that is growing and evolving. I look forward to seeing and hearing more from this Artist."
5,one of the best albums of 1999,"Julia Darling is a very mature songwriter even though she's a young woman. This is a diverse set of moving songs that span a wide range of ideas and emotions. The instrumentation and production are unusual and reward repeated listening. My favorite track is ""Crinolines and Waltzing."""
2,overwhelming for most,"You better have alot of knowledge in the world of nutrition and fat loss to even begin to understand the jargon in this book.The methods described are way different than you have ever heard of.The overall system is understandable, but its very confusing to read.Not a good book unless you are a serious well educated person in the field of nutrition and fat loss."
2,For Medical Personnel Only,"This book is written to stimulate the intellectuals that need their minds massaged with science terminology. This is not an easy read, nor would I recommend it to those that are seeking weight loss material. Get your medical dictionary out, wipe off the dust. Time to go back to school.For those who have no interest in going back to med school, pass on this publication. It is not easy to understand. It appears that the author sets out to impress those in the medical fields. For most readers, it is dry. You will fight to keep your eyes open and have a harder time convincing yourself to continue on with this read.This book is very technical in nature. Unless you are a physician or a biologist, you might want to pass on this book. It makes me wonder what is the target audience the author was trying to reach. For those in the medical field, it will impress. For the lay person, it falls short of being effective."
1,A bit too technical,"I saw an interview with the author on [...] and was so impressed with his knowledge that I ordered this book. Much to my chagrin, this book was much too technical for me to comprehend. Even though I consider myself pretty knowledgeable about health, you literally have to have a degree in endocrinology or physiology to understand his writing. I could barely understand the book. Needless to say, I was very disappointed. The book probably could have been dumbed down to the average readers level. Unless you have advanced knowledge on this subject, I would not purchase this book."
5,What a great book!!!,"I was so impressed with the feelings conveyed, and just the most well told story from This child's eyes. I have lent it out to many teachers, and parents."
1,Atrocious sound,"I was initially very excited to get this album in the mail. Surely an album with Frankie Ruiz and Tommy Olivencia hits would be great. Sadly this album was truly mistaken. The sound quality is undoubtedly the worst I have ever heard from an original CD. Atrocious. I would understand this quality in an album recorded 4 or 5 decades ago, but not even those are as bad as this one. It makes the album just un-enjoyable and I am one to not criticize sound quality too much in my reviews. My advice would be to STAY AWAY from this album and enjoy other Olivencia albums such as Plante Bandera and Triangulo del Triunfo."
5,CRANK this up!,"This dude can flat out play guitar!! Tony's vibe and soloing is completely unique and so refreshing to hear. And his lyrics hold hope and meaning too. If you like guitar heroes and don't have Tony Spinner on your list, add him today."
5,SUPERMAN-ORGINAL TV SHOW SCORE,"I have loved certain kinds of music used in serials of the thirties and 40s along with a few tv shows as well. To find a disc with the original Superman tv show music is just astounding since the music was used in other series in the early 50s. You can feel the tempo of Metropilis one moment and then envision Rusty and Rinty at Fort Apache at another moment. Whoever composed these themes was nothing short of a musical genius. I am glad that I am not the only one who has been taken by this music. I am also glad that someone found the original recordings and put them on a disc. I had a set of earphones on and heard only one click showing how great the score was cleaned up for a digital presentation.For those who are familiar with this music, this is a must own disc."
2,Too much Season One,"This TV soundtrack is OK, but the best 'Adventures of Superman' music came from its second season, which, in this listener's humble opinion, contained the best episodes, as well.Too bad the soundtrack from the all-time best episode, 'Panic in the Sky', didn't make it to this CD. Granted, much of the music was repeated from episode to episode, however, season two could have easily been included here."
5,Messenger of the Blues,"This band ranks highly alongside other great rockin' bands as Deep Purple,Led Zepplin,Cream,etc. This album,along with ""To the Station"", have not left my ""stacker"" since I purchased them some months back, and their first C.D. ""Blindside"" is taking a brief rest,after many months of listening !!!!!!!!!!The vocals & guitar of Mike Onesko are brilliant and I looove the driving bass line.If your looking/listening to these masterpieces and they grab ya Blues soul...or anywhere else! buy them ya wont be disapointed !!!!!!!!!"
5,Paraben Free and SPF in a sheer...,"I have had a hard time finding a paraben free foundation that is more sheer and dewy than the various mineral powder... I also hoped for SPF and a reasonable price point with a price that wouldn't pack a punch on my wallet if the color wasn't that wearable... Oh and being gentle to my sensitive skin was a very important factor...This definitely fits those requirements. It is called ""Glow Sheers"" and it is just that- very sheer- just enough of a hint of color to even out my skin and make it look healthy and smooth and dewy... Of course any large blemishes require more coverage than this offers... It does not aggravate my sensitive skin, nor make me bumpy... I am trying to be a little more thorough about wearing sunscreen when I go out and this will be perfect- doesn't require a million steps to get it to look good which is a plus to this busy mom."
4,Do it (till you're satisfied ! )...,"In the 1970s, it wasn't uncommon to find a funk band that was entirely self-contained - all of the producing, writing, and arranging was done by actual bandmembers, not outsiders. This funk-disco group was formed by Jeff Lane in 1972 in Brooklyn NY. They started as David House Rockers in 1972 and later were called the Brooklyn Trucking Express. They were never totally self-contained; even its first major hit, ""Do It ('Til You're Satisfied),"" was written by someone who wasn't an official member: guitarist Billy Nichols. The group consisted keyboardist Michael Jones (later well known as Kashif). Nevertheless the Best of B.T has such a good track list and without them your funk collection is incomplete. On the whole this disc is something funksters should savor."
5,"A Great Collection, But...","This is a great collection of their hits, but I happened across the BT Express Anthology, which appears to be more complete. I found it by searching for ""BT Express"" (not ""B.T. Express"") here on Amazon. Either way you get it, it is great music!"
3,The headset worked and that's all that matters.,"The Nokia N-gage (in 2011) is way past its prime. Outperformed by every smart phone and high-end cellular device out there. But to this day, I still stand by the sound quality of the N-gage's mp3 player. It's a great quality listening experience, and the NOKIA brand HDD-2 headset is vital gear. The sound quality of this headset is great, and the button and mic make it perfect for making calls, picking up and hanging up calls, and also using voice command features.The only beef I have with these headsets is that they seem to stop working after many months. I've been through at least four headsets, and every one eventually has one earpiece not working. If I jiggle the cord in one ear, it may come back in for a while. But whatever the problem is, those are the facts."
2,Too Brief,"The idea of this book was great but unfortunately it was disappointing. It does not go into enough detail into any of the managers' investment processes to be able to apply them. I would suggest reading instead The Intelligent Investor, John Neff on Investing, or The Warren Buffet Way."
4,good investor interview book - inspiring,like the Investment Gurus book in that it interviews great investors.very good food for investment thinking. boring to read though took many times to open it to finish it
4,Saves Gas,My family and I took a trip to Yellowstone from Ohio.We towed my 35ft. camper out and back. This item added at least one MPG to our trip.Paid for itself in two weeks.
3,tough book,"The look of the book is for the young, but it is hard for them to understand. I purchased it to share with classes, but that hasn't been easy."
1,What kind of book is this?,I came here in the 60's and I'm not a historian but you would have to be blind to miss the mistakes in this book. Facts are facts and his are wrong. How is this history?
1,Devil in the details,"The Devil is in the details. The author claims that an old Petoskey hotel had 800 rooms, more that twice the present number in the famed Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island. He shows a tourist steamer plying a river that never existed. He writes of a White Pine Trail through Bay View when the actual trail never comes within 90 miles of Petoskey. Our neighbor, Charlevoix, has a population of less than 3000, not the 8,500 claimed by the author. What good is detail when it is dead wrong?"
1,STICK TO THE CD,"THE SOUND QUALITY IS GREAT, VERY CLOSE TO ORIGINAL IF NOT EXACT. THE GRAPHICS ARE SHARP AND CLEAR. GREAT PRODUCT! HERE'S WHY I GAVE SUCH A LOW SCORE. YOU HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET TO USE IT SO THEY CAN CHECK TO SEE THAT YOU PAID FOR IT. I AM A KARAOKE DJ AND THOUGHT I COULD JUST TRANSFER THE FILE TO MY LAPTOP AND DO A SHOW, YOU CANNOT BECAUSE IT IS AS IF YOU ARE JUST BORROWING IT AND IT STOPS WORKING AFTER A COUPLE OF MONTHS. I WISH I HAD KNOWN BEFORE BUYING $40 WORTH OF THIS STUFF. THERE ARE OTHER COMPANIES THAT DO SELL YOU THE MP4 VIDEO FILE TO USE AS YOU LIKE."
3,"""Good?"" No. ""Interesting?"" Yes.","I read this book because I'm dating a Mormon and wanted to learn more about LDS. It's well-written. It's interesting, too, in the purest sense of the word. Unfortunately what I learned is: 1) nobody who is not a Mormon and who has at least a high school education will consider this book balanced or objective; and 2) it scares the hell out of me that any adult in the 21st century would believe the trype LDS promotes. That's not really a criticism of the book -- it didn't invent the history, it just promotes it -- but if you want a volume that truly depresses you about the gullibility and desperation of man, this is it."
4,Fair and even handed summary of complex subject,"Arrington and Bitton offer the reader a single volume history of the Mormon Church based on historical, rather than missionary principals. Both authors make no secret of their LDS affiliations; but for the uncommited reader this is an advantage, rather than a drawback, since their ""bias"" is stated and can thus be taken into account. As a non-mormon, I can confidently recommend this book as an excellent introduction to the subject, both to the general reader and the serious student of Religious Studies. In multi-faith Birmingham England I would have no compunction in recommending this book as the one for any of my students interested in the subject. Pity its not available in England."
3,good book,I purchased this book as a requirment for my college Cultural Anthropology class and was an interesting read. I recieved good service from the seller
5,Perfect size for kids,"I bought these to give out to my son's classmates for Christmas. I paired them with crayons, put them in a cute Christmas bag . . . instant smiles. The pad is the perfect size for kids to doodle. My son has been drawing on his for several days now and hasn't run out of paper yet."
2,Cute but not functional,"I ordered and returned this. Callers said that they heard static, couldn't hear me clearly, and just poor quality. I couldn't hear callers, and the ear piece flopped around my ear, not really fitting. The bronzy looks is kind of cheap and plastic-y, and looks better online than in person."
2,Didn't Work for Us...,"I bought this for my husband who has a Nokia phone and we could not get it to work. We even took it to AT&T to have them see if they could help. The suggested calling Nokia which we did and they couldn't get it to work, so we returned it. It might of just been a bad one, but I thought you should know...."
3,Nokia Headset,"Not bad. It is a little awkward to turn on and off. It takes a while for it to turn on and off. Also it isn't as comfortable as my previous one, but it is alot more durable because it has only one piece that moves."
4,Pretty fair!,I liked the album and will play it occasionally. I am a Gladys fan and I enjoy religious music. It wasn't everything I hoped for but I think others should judge for themselves.
4,Gladys -- brilliant voice,"To the reviewer from Maine: ""Decent"" voice -- are you kidding? She has one of the all time great voices. Stop worrying about her supposed comments about Diana Ross and her gambling problem and concentrate on that magnificent instrument! You're missing out."
5,Heaven!,"Gladys Knight is one of the few post-Motown era voices to sustain to the end of the millenium. Here is her first ""inspirational"" album and it is a winner! Gladys' soulful voice makes every word of ""Mercy's Arms"" true; a beautiful and moving track. Combining different sounds, Knight espouses her faith in a memorable and enjoyable testament. Destined to be a classic."
4,Good Disc,I Have Always Respected Gladys Knight.She is One of The Baddest Artists ever.Her voice is Timeless.The Material is Pretty Good but it is Hit&Miss at times but Her Voice is Strong no Matter what.
5,A practical and spiritual guide to pregnancy,This book is uplifting and inspiring. Gurmukh Khalsa combines practical advice with the devine. Her words are gentle and genuine. I highly recommend this to anyone who would like to connect spiritually with the physical changes of pregnancy and childbirth. Gurmukh offers yoga techniques and meditations to prepare mentally and physically for the baby's birth. A beautiful book.
5,Give Me More Gram,Such a short life for Gram but so much great music. This live album capturing a Long Island NY radio broadcast is another reminder of how strong his legacy is.
4,Wonderful Gram,"Gram's voice sounds even more lucious live. The live takes, for the most part, outshine their studio counterparts as the band sounds more committed and rawer. One thing- Gram totally misses the beat with ""Drug Store Truck Driving Man."" The song's supposed to be a cynical take on Nashville DJ Ralph Emery, not a love song!! Though it's well done, it pales when compared to the sneer of Roger McGuinn's vocal and Clarence White's guitar on the Byrds' ""Live at the Willmore West."""
4,Quintessential GP doing country and R&R with Emmylou...,"This is truly Gram Parsons at his best. He and Emmylou Harris roll through country and gospel numbers to Rock and Roll screamers with a top notch band that knows all the hot licks, when to get loud and when to get sad. You'll cry in your beer while Gram reminds you of your old sweetheart on ""Cry One More Time"", you'll put on your cowboy boots at the first steel-licks in ""Drug Store Truck-Drivin' Man"" and you'll long for a truck and a wide open desert road when ""Six Days on the Road"" rolls you on home. From Byrds to Burritos to 50's Rock covers like ""Bony Maronie"" and Chuck Berry's ""Almost Grown"" and Country deep cuts like Merle Haggard's ""California Cottonfields,"" Gram will make you wonder why you've never heard of this album before. Highly recommended for any country-rock fans or anyone who would rather drink a Lone Star in a roadhouse than a Guinness in a Pub."
4,"A Little Ragged, But Worth Owning","This is a ""live in the studio"" performance recorded before a small audience for an ""underground FM"" station in Long Island (remember those?).""Uneven"" is the word that springs to mind. It starts out with a great version of ""We'll Sweep Out the Ashes,"" and radiates a certain loose charm throughout... but Emmy Lou has a terrible time staying on mike (at one point someone jokingly tells her to ""sing into the little black thing""). And some songs work a lot better than others. If it were an LP and I had to listen to every track in order, it probably would stay on the shelf, but I've actually listened to it quite a bit, track-skipping past the dubious moments.If you like Gram Parson, it's worth buying, but it's not ""Gram Parsons at his best."""
2,Nothing New,"If I buy an expose I expect to learn something that is not commonly available to a well read public. Such is not the case with Gertz' latest book.While it nicely assembles the data in one tome, there are no revelations that the person who would be tempted to buy the book would not already know.Save your money."
1,Israel's connection!,How could we wrtie a book about arm prolifecation and not have a chapter about Israerl. The whole world knows that Israel has nucler capabilities just like Iran or North Korea has! But how is that okay? Iran can not have the bomb but Israel can?What kind of Logic is that?
1,"yes, but...",How is this different from us selling weapons to Iran in order to illegally fund the Contras?Or when we were supplying Hussein with weapons and money 20 years ago?
1,Partially bias,"The author blames Germany.France and Russia for the failure policies in the middle east and Afghanistan but their OWN U.S.government 1.-Author hardly mentions how US government helped Sadam Hussein to consolidate his power.2.-US government tilted its military help toward Iraq when Sadam invaded Iran.3,- How US Government helped the Taliban and other radical moslen groups in Afghanistan during the Soviet occupation in the early 1980's.Author is dishonet by omission.Read ""Forbidden Truth"" about US and the Taliban and ""Dreaming War"",about oil in the Middle East,also ""Charlie Wilson's war"" US intervention in Afghanistan."
1,DID HE FORGET ABOUT REAGON AND BUSH?,"This book is a joke, and another atmept to place blame on Clinton, when in fact this goes back to Bush Sr. Wheres the part about those two Presidents selling arms to Hussain ? If it were not for the GOP book clubs who tell their members to buy these books so they will stay on top, this book would be on the lower level of a slug. But, if you like the works of Bill ""O'liely"" and Drug Limbough, then you will like this book, its right up your alley, full of right wing hate,and nonesense without remorse. Gertz is spreading fear, just like the NeoCons want him to...."
3,"OK, but no Doctor Who..","I bought this out of curiosity, being (one of the few, it seems) who actually liked Colin Banker and Nicola Bryant's era on Doctor Who. While, I enjoyed seeing them both again, this special didn't really have that certain magic that Doctor Who managed to conjure out of low budgets and little effects.Still, it almost worth the price just to hear Nicola Bryant's natural voice and British accent instead of the forced ""American"" speak she had to assume for ""Peri""."
1,Camera Dock Kit,"The Kodak EasyShare Camera Dock Kit is find, except the rechargeable battery which came with it and was supposed to be placed into the camera did not fit, so I have been unable to use the dock kit. The dock is the size that is specified to go with the camera, but the battery does not fit in the camera. I have to use a regular battery in order to use the camera."
3,Battery Didn't Work,I have the ZD8612 IS...from what I understood this was suppose to be all I needed. Sad to say it was not. I had to purchase a rechargeable battery. I'm sad that I had to make a purchase after buying the dock but happy my camera is now working so I can take pictures of my divas (3yrs and 8mos old).
1,Battery doesn't fit z712,"You guys really need to stop promoting this Dock kit with the z712 camera. The battery doen't fit. But, there you have it sitting right next to the Z712 as a pair. False advertising!! You getting a kickback from the supplier? I had to read thru the reviews to find a battery that may work with this thing, and if it doesn't I am out the $40 I paid for it. This is the first time I have had trouble with Amazon but, after reading the other review, it's pretty apparent that you knew about this and haven't done anything."
1,Does Amazon/Kodak read these reviews?,"Does either Amazon or Kodak read these review? There are a number of other reviews stating that the dock kit comes with the wrong battery for the easyshare camera. I just received the dock this week, and the battery was not the correct one for my camera. Nice way to do business, Kodak!"
2,Don't get what you pay for !,I purchased Easy Share Camera Dock kit. The rechargable battery that came with the kit does not work in the Z712 camera that I just purchased. The case is to small and really serves no purpose. I did purchase a Kodak KLIC 8000 Equivalent Li-ion Battery and it does charge in my camera on the dock. I am glad it wasn't very expensive.
5,Kodak Easy Share Camera Dock Kit.,"This kit has a handy bag so you can take it and your camera anywhere.A must for camera users,Can keep your camera charged and ready to use."
1,"Kodak ""uneasy"" Share",The USB cable did not fit into the pc port. The center plug that goes into the camera does not fit the camera. I bought a USB that goes from the camera to the computer. It came with a CD that was much less than camera dock kit. What an expensive disappointment. Am item manufactured by Kodak does not work with its own brand that it is supposed to support. Do not purchase.
1,check before you buy,"I imagine the dock itself is alright but you have to get the right battery for it to work. It came with one but would not fit my 1012. Nothing said about this in the advertisement. Wouldn even charge kodak batteries, just that certian pack.So no would not recommend this without a lot of checking"
5,Christmas gift,I ordered this for my granddaughter for Christmas and am very pleased with it. It came promptly and was just what I wanted.
3,Not what I expected...,"I bought this dock for my Z712 IS Kodak easy share camera. While the dock is completely compatible, the rechargeable battery was the wrong battery. So I ended up paying solely for the dock and have yet to buy a seperate $30 battery to make it really work. I was more than a little disappointed. So know that this battery is NOT and Li-ion battery and WON""T fit this type of camera."
2,A Real Disappointment,"I purchaced this product along with a Kodak camera, EasyShare C182. It said that it would work with all EasyShare C camera's, and it will not. The only thing in the kit that I can use is the lense cleaning solution, and cloth, and the case, which has a belt loop, but no shoulder strap."
2,Kodak Easy Share Dock Kit,"I don't blame Amazon for carrying this item but have already communicated directly to Kodak. This kit is misrepresented! We needed to replace an older model dock station that no longer transferred pictures. This is the correct replacement but no where on the box or in the description does it tell you that the CABLE, a necessity, is not included!!! The kit contains a camera bag (NOT NEEDED and didn't want it..I have one and I was not ordering a camera!) Kit also includes lens cleaning solution and a cleaning cloth, plus rechargeable batteries...ALSO NOT NEEDED!) The box makes mention that perhaps one can use their former cable...OUR former cable was not compatible with this new kit! Had to order a separate cable, which in itself was rather inexpensive but could have easily been included in the kit if they had eliminated the useless camera bag, cleaning supplies + batteries!!!"
1,"Sure nuf, the battery DOES NOT FIT the Z712 IS!!","I too was duped into believing this dock would be compatible with my Kodak Z712 IS camera. Who wouldn't? After all, AMAZON shows the dock PAIRED with the Z712 IS!!But the battery packaged with this dock kit does not fit the battery compartment of the Kodak Z712 IS camera. WHAT'S UP WITH THIS??? I WANT A BATTERY THAT FITS!!Kodak EasyShare Camera Dock Kit"
3,Not compatible with Z812 IS,"I'm sure the dock works fine, but the battery does NOT fit my brand new Z812 IS camera. The box says that it should be compatible with the Z series, and the camera does fit on the dock itself, but the battery doesn't even begin to fit inside the camera. This dock was the one recommended on the Kodak website, also confirming that it would be compatible--but it isn't.I'm in the process of trying to return it to Amazon, but apparently the selection I chose from the drop-down box (not compatible with my existing product) categorized my return as needing a replacement. I don't think I CAN get a replacement. It looks like I need a totally different battery and charger.I'm sure the dock is great--I never had any trouble with my old one (upgraded cameras recently and need a new dock). Just make sure it'll fit!"
4,Wrong re-chargable battery,"Works great, easy set up, only caveat make sure re-chargable battery that comes with it is the right one for camera. Mine wasn't and ended up having to order the right one and pay additional shipping charges."
3,Kit price is less than the dock price alone,"I only want the dock but have not been able to find it for less than the kit. (OK, the kit was 4 cents more on the Kodak web site, but still cheaper here.) So if you want the dock, buy the kit, and recycle the stuff that won't work with your camera.Get some other kind of bag. I like Lowepro and they have compatability size charts for their bags on their web site (www.lowepro.com) for Kodak cameras. For instance, I got aLowepro Rezo 20 Camera Case (Black)for my Z1285."
2,camara dock kit,"The carrying case is fine, but the rechargable battery that comes with this dock does not work with v712is camera. That is one of the main reason that i bought this kit, i needed a recharable battery so this seem a good deal. so much for that !!"
1,this port was told wrong to me by this company,This cameria does not fit the kodak easy share CX 7300 this is the camera dock 3M873/ M883I was told by both ends this canera would workit does not fit AT ALLI would like Bob to send me the correct port for this cameria or refund moneyI am still waiting on the memory cards 3 of them and a battey charger to plug in car and housethis is very importand that I get these items soonboth patyies were wrong about the cameria fitting in this portPlease take cae of his matterplease send correct port or cameriaplease send memory cardplease send augo battery charger and home charheror I must do a write off on visasend ups to home I am disabledor you give total refund plus someting of my time i spent buying batterys and cards and strapplease make this correct of I must write my band and your bank
2,Doesn't work on all easy share cameras,Before I purchased it I tried to make sure it would work on my camera. It's an older Easy Share model. The information provided online indicated it would - it didn't. So I have a new dock I don't need. Not worth the trouble.
1,Incorrect item shipped with camera. Credit never given after item returned.,"Do not rely on Amazon recommending items to go along with previouly purchased items. I purchased a camera and Amazon recommended an entirely wrong Dock to go with it. The mistake was bad enough but when they were informed of thier mistake one would think they would have bent over backwards to correct it. To my knowledge, my credit care was never credited. I never received an apology and they tried to make it seem like their mistake was mine."
5,EasyShare Dock,I bought two of these dock kits as christmas gifts for my mom and grandma who received the cameras as gifts earlier in the year. Great prices on the dock kits too. The dock is great for people who have trouble getting the pictures off their camera and onto their computer. Or those who always take their camera to the drugstore to retrieve and edit their pictures! I'm very happy with this purchase.
3,"Works, But Only with Supplied Battery Pack","This is the second Kodak docking station I've purchased. The first one, for my previous camera, always worked like a charm. I initially had problems with this second one, because it wouldn't recharge the two Kodak rechargeable batteries I had in the camera. I found the problem--the charger will only work with the rechargeable battery pack that comes with the docking station. Once I pulled out the separate batteries and installed the battery pack, it worked fine. I suspect that Kodak installed some sort of mechanical sensor in the docking station that feels for the battery pack before enabling the recharger. Seems silly, particularly since this is not mentioned in the brief instruction manual. Still, now that I have the ""official"" battery pack installed, the docking station is fine. I also connected the data cable to my PC, and that works fine too when transferring photos."
3,Better to Buy Separately?,"The dock kit seemed like a good deal because it was an easy way to get everything we'd need, at a good price. But the camera case doesn't have a shoulder strap (or any other way to carry it hands-free)! That made the case almost useless to me."
1,Does not fit our camera,"There is an insert that sits between the camera and the dock. The insert does not exist for our camera- per kodak- but we only found this out AFTER we purchased this dock kit.FYI, if you own a Kodak Z710, do not buy this dock. We were lead to believe otherwise."
1,DOES NOT WORK ON Z1012 IS,"The dock has an incompatible battery for the Z1012 IS camera. When the camera is placed on the dock, the camera no longer downloads to my MAC. So, it really doesn't work in any way at all. By process of elimination, I think that the K8500-C+1 rechargeable battery kit with the KLIC-8000 rechargeable battery should work. This is frustrating since the dock kit said it was compatible with the Z1012 IS but upon further review it shows multiple ** with disclaimers. Don't get fooled.Good luck."
1,Shouldn't have been offered with this camera.,"Nice package,not for my Z8612. Included battery donsn't fit in camera, camera barely fits in case {with useless belt loop} and dock wont charge non Kodak batteries.Would be nice deal for right camera. Its going back."
3,Description needs more detail!!!!!!,"I recently purchased this camera dock along with a Kodak EasyShare Z812 IS camera. The description for the dock does not give much information on the rechargeable battery that comes with it. Well, the battery does not work in my camera....I checked under the Accessories and the section labeled ""Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought""......and this camera dock was shown under both areas. So one could assume that this camera dock would work with this camera, right? WRONG!!Now I have a $15 Kodak battery and have no way of using it. Make sure if you are purchasing this dock that the battery is going to work with your camera..."
4,Kodak EasyShare Camera Dock Kit,Kodak EasyShare Camera Dock KitEasy to follow instructions to install on computer.Works as advertised.
2,Battery doesn't fit Kodak Easyshare C743,"I just opened my dock kit and began to assemble and the included battery is too big for the C743 camera. The battery must be for one of the older cameras that is bigger. I think it's odd, as the camera dock series 3 is the correct camera dock. I'm disappointed with my purchase and wasted the money that went toward the battery. I don't know whether the dock works okay, because I didn't get that far. This is my second easyshare camera and dock and I was very happy with the first one. Now I have to buy another battery."
2,Kodak Easyshare camera dock kit,"At the time I purchased the Kodak Z712 camera, a link allowed purchasing the camera along with this dock kit, which includes the dock, cables, a rechargeable battery, a lens cleaning kit and a case. The dock, case and cables are fine. The lens cleaning kit had completely leaked out and ruined the lens cloth. The biggest problem was that the battery did NOT fit the camera!"
1,lame,this would be a good product if it came with a way to hook it up to the computer there is no cable to connect from the docking station to a USB or anything
1,Inadequate description of product use,"Kodak makes contacting them a difficult process. Because of limited product description, I spent money on an item that was not needed. After many attempts at ordering the plastic connector plate for the camera, a human was reached. I will not buy a Kodak product again. The camera processes 14 photographs and the battery dies.I have never had so many problems so quickly with any camera. From now on, I may buy disposable cameras only."
4,Works as it should,"I am one of those ridiculous males that has to have all of the bells and whistles whether I really need them or not. I could have gotten by without this item by just changing batteries in the camera now and then.It is a little easier to just put the camera on the charger and take it off when the batteries are charged. So, if you like bells and whistles this is a pretty good one. It works fine and my friends are impressed."
4,The Outlaws - 'Hittin' The Road' (Shrapnel),"I realize that good southern rock has never really died out,but I haven't heard too much about the Outlaws in some time now.Happen to come across this live CD,so I thought I'd check it out.Good sound quality,I noticed.Many of you are probably already familiar with most of the ten tracks played here,like ""There Goes Another Love Song"",""Superficial Love"",""Ghost Riders In The Sky"",""Evil,Wicked,Mean&Nasty"" and their signature tune ""Green Grass And High Tide""(has it REALLY been thirty years since this song first came out?)Still love hearing those most recogized played guitar licks,you know...later in the song.Line-up:Hugh Thomasson and Henry Paul-guitar&vocals,Frank O'Keefe-bass,Billy Jones-guitar and Monte Yoho-drums.Obviously,this CD should appeal to fans of Blackfoot,Molly Hatchet,Marshall Tucker Band and .38 Special.Southern rock fans,rejoice!"
3,"Good for memories, but...","The Live versions of the songs on this album are not all that great. ""Ghost Riders"" is exceptionally disappointing, though ""Hurry Sundown"" sounded pretty good. It would be a boon if the other albums were re-released. I have met only disappointment in trying to locate even a vinyl of them."
2,More guitars doesn't necessarily produce better music,"When the Outlaws lost Henry Paul they lost their create force. They tried to make up it, by replacing him with two guitarists. The sound never matched their Paul days, nor did it approach the sound created by the likes of Rossington/Collins of Lynyrd Skynyrd or the original southern rock duo, Allman/Betts."
4,Good book but pricey,"Since receiving this book I have tried several of the recipes and they are really delicious. Very easy to make with small ingredient lists is the perfect addition to even the lazy cooks cookbook shelf. My only gripe was it's a little pricey but hey if you make several recipes and then pass the recipes around to friends it pays for itself.Just so you know, the apple cakes are to die for. OMG, just soooooo delicious. Great way to snap up an easy dessert to take out to a pot luck supper or surprise your hostess at a dinner party."
3,for kindle or pc,a little hard to use... be very careful when reading ingredients. its in table format and some items do not line up correctly with amounts.some things worth a try though
4,Good notebook,"Good size. Works well for writing things down on a kneeboard with while flying. Knocked a star for not having perforations near the top of the sheets; when you tear sheets off, the paper comes apart at the top, sometimes falling off in pieces making a mess."
5,Love this product!,My 2 yr old now knows all of his shapes and colors. He also knows 19 letters of the alphabet. He has learned so much from watching these videos.
1,NOT HAVE IT,I WAS AT HOME BACK THEN. AND JUST LEARNING TO BUY ON LINE. NEVER GOT IT. AND BACK THEN I GOT SO MANY THIS. I FORGOT. ABOUT IT.
5,These are awesome!,"As a former teacher now stay at home mom, I was skeptical that these would actually teach my son at such a young age. I started putting them on when he was about 9 mos. while I took a shower. He probably watched each one 1 time per week. By 19 mos. he can identify and say all of his colors, shapes, numbers 1-10 and 23/26 letters. He even points out numbers and letters at stores and while I'm driving. I reinforce a little but definitely don't spend time drilling him, haha. People are amazed at what he knows and even his Pediatrician was surprised at his language skills. I always tell others it's because of these DVDs, I definitely cannot take all the credit. I am considering homeschooling him and will buy the sight words DVDs. I'm also looking into purchasing other preschool prep products online. I HIGHLY recommend these. Although, I can't quite sit through them (very repetitive, which is how children learn), they are worth spending the money."
4,pre school learning,"This is a great way to introduce or reinforce numbers, letters, colors to your toddler. My kids love seeing the scenes they create for each character (number, shape...). My 4-6 year olds also write the character as they watch."
4,Great Product,"I bought these for my preschoolers and I am very happy with the results that I am already seeing with them. They are very repetitive but in a fun way that keeps their attention and makes each letter, shape, color, and sight word more memorable. I would recommend these for all those who are trying to give their child that extra step up before they start school."
1,These are terrible.,"I got this set for my 10 month old. It is terrible. It repeats the color, shape or number over and over but doesn't say anything else. For example the colors start off with blue and for several minutes it just says blue over and over and over."
4,Great Help,helps children to use television time more effectively & also parents like since the child also learns while watching it.
5,Preschool Prep DVDs,"I have a two year old grandson and a couple months ago he began showing interest in the letters of the alphabet. I read reviews about the Preschool Prep Letters, Numbers, Shapes and Colors DVDs and was interested that most of the reviews, while stating that the DVDs can be quite boring for adults, said they fascinated young children. I purchased the DVDs and could not believe how my grandson loved them. He started with the Letters one and quickly learned to recognize the letters and would sit in front of the TV and ""shout"" out the letters as they appeared. He totally loved the DVD. The Colors and Shapes DVDs were equally effective in helping to reinforce the topics covered. I hate to see a young child watching too much on the TV but I think these DVDs stimulated an interest in some concepts that are good for a child to understand.b"
5,my daughter knows...,"after watching the dvds 3 times my 18 month old daughter knows her number from 1-10, in English and Spanish. She knows the shapes and most of the colors. I am yet to show her the other dvds that remain, but I am convinced these dvds work. It is repetitive, but that doesn`t seem to bother her. She actually really enjoys and if it were up to her she would be watching them every day. I definitely recommend this set."
3,BORING!,I'm not sure why I spent this much money on these videos... I'm not sure how much my son is learning from these videos.. blue.. . blue... blue.... blue BLUE blue... . when will it end?!?
1,Such a disappointment,"My boys (3 & 5) were so excited to turn on this new dvd. After 10 minutes (a slow and grueling 10 minutes) we ALL wanted to turn it off. So boring. There is nothing to captivate my children or keep their attention. Pure boring, slow repetition."
5,perfect for my 19 month old!,"my daughter's godmother got this for her as a christmas gift. so far we've only used the meet the colors and meet the letters (we try not to used too many of these videos at once) and although its boring for me (it reapeats the same thing OVER and OVER) my daughter not only likes it but shes REALLY learning. so far she says all the color words, and can repeat all the letters. she recognizes about 5 different colors and daily she amazes me with the letters. Just yesterday at the park she saw the letter X on a tic tac toe board and she showed me the X and said ""X?"" then she looked at the o and said ""O?"" my daughter is 19months old and has been watching those two dvd's for a week. its really amazing to see how quick a child can learn with the right tools. I can't wait until we start meet the numbers and meet the shapes!"
1,Horribly boring,"I'm still confused about how this set got awards. I tried a few DVDs and my kids got bored after 2 minutes. I'm guessing it's good for kids that don't get to watch any kind of TV otherwise, then it probably holds their attention, but if your kid is used to watching other things on TV, there's no way they'll stand for it."
1,If you need your child to sleep,"We purchased this DVD with great anticipation due to earlier positive reviews. However after our first viewing, it was very clear that our 2 year old son was not the least bit interested in watching or learning. He either walks away from the television or falls asleep. In fact, it was actually painful to sit through the video with him. The constant repetition was appropriate but the animation and music were quite dreary. If you have insomnia I would highly recommend it. As a learning tool, don't bother. I find the leapfrog videos much more stimulating and appealing."
5,fantastic,"My three year old has watched this video over and over and completely loves it. He knows the alphabet, colors, shapes, numbers and some sight words already. Highly recommended!!!!!"
5,Amazing DVD's,"My now 16 month old daughter loves these DVD's. She has been watching them since she was 7 or 8 months old. I am amazed at what she has learned. She knows several colors, shapes, numbers and letters. She even asks to watch them by saying ""DVD"". These are very educational. I have now purchased them for friends as well."
3,Not for Every Child,These dvd's I would say is more geared towards very young children ages 1-2. My 3 year old find it very boring. I guess it work for a lot of kids from the review but not mine. Every child is different because the learning aides that I used for my first son does not work for my present 3 year old. I would not say this is a bad product just because it does not work for my son. He learned his letters and sounds in a few days using the leapfrog dvd that I brought after this set did not work for him. As I say all kids are different
1,Don't waste your money! ;/,"I was a bit apprehensive about purchasing these as other reviews stated the videos were SO boring and therefor failed to keep their little one's attention. As one reviewer pointed out, what is boring to an adult isn't always so for a child, so I figured I'd give it a try. BIG MISTAKE. I bought the 4 disk pack and I'm really kicking myself because after popping in the ""Meet the Letter's' DVD we only made it to the letter D before the kids were over it. Literally, there is nothing more to this DVD then that they flash the letter on the screen--and then say the letter over and over. You might as well go get yourself a set of flash cards and use those with the kids--its essentially the same as this DVD.We have Leapster's Letter Factory and both my boys LOVE it. Now I'm wondering what I'm going to do with 4 worthless disks that aren't going to be watched and that got a total play time of 7 minutes. ;/ VERY dissatisfied, what a waste of money. ;("
2,Kids are not interested...,"I bought this with very high hopes after I became a SAHM and my kids were no longer going to daycare/preschool. I read the reviews and thought my kids were going to love it. The video consists of a word being repeated over and over and over and over while it is also visible on the screen. My kids are 2 and 3, so maybe they are a little too young for it, but it bores them. After the first three words, they lose interest. I wish it was more interactive and captivating because I think it is worthwhile for children to learn these words early."
3,It's OK,"After reading many reviews, I decided to go with the Pre-School Prep series. I think the idea is 'great'...but the reality may not be so easily implemented/attained. My daughter, 3 1/2, gets bored with the videos pretty quickly. I think that she's past 'her' prime learning opportunity with these videos. Had we started earlier, they may have kept her attention better. We are still using them, but after showing her The ABC Factory by Leap Frog, it's hard to get her to go back."
3,Good Learning Tool,"I just received this DVD set, and the 4 pack Leap Frog. Although the repetion can be mind numbing to an adult, my 16 month old grandchild watched the Colors DVD with interest while sitting in her high chair during snack time. I did a quick review of the other DVDs in the set. Since it does say it is for ages 9 months and up, I do feel that this set will be a good learning tool, and is age appropriate. UPDATE; We have had this set for several weeks, and I have to admit that I have been pleased with how the material is presented. Right now we are covering the Colors and Shapes DVDS. I watch it with my granddaughter, and become very involved with her learning. It's important to ""test"" your child by asking them to bring you their ""purple bunny"", ""green cup"" etc to reinforce what they have learned. When the purple segment came on, my granddaughter grabbed her ""purple bunny"" and sat down and watched with great interest which shows me she is understanding the concept of colors."
1,Too slow,"I ordered this DVDs for my two years old, however it play too slow and does not goes to the next chapter instead keep repeating."
2,Broken,"I recieved my videos with the center pieces that holds the DVD broken in shipping, so all the DVD were scratched I have been useing them in hopes they don't skip. I have'nt been able to take the time to return them or contact anyone. I have a 7 yr.old special needs son and a 3yr. old daughter so time to return things for some is easy but not for me."
1,Never Received DVDs. Refund instead. Still selling though. Irritated.,"I was so excited to get these DVDs, but they never arrived. I emailed SuperMart and they refunded my money. I didn't want a refund because I wanted the DVDs. I emailed them that I didn't want a refund and they emailed me that they were out of stock...however SuperMart was still selling them on Amazon. So, I emailed them that I wanted them to keep my money and send me the DVDs that they obviously had since they were STILL selling them. They completely ignored my email and have never responded. I will never purchase anything from them again! They did refund my money quickly but I just wanted them to send me the DVDs."
3,Not Quite,"I was a little disappointed in this set. I wanted to like it. The kids, 3,4 and 5 seem to get bored half way through. The 5 year old did watch them all the way through, but after about 6 times....he was done. He did learn some though. It is very repetitive. I think the Letter factory and others from Leap frog are much better and keep the kids interest way longer! And has letter sounds which are needed for kindergarten."
4,"Not bad, fun to watch for the kids","This seems to engage my grandson a lot more than other ""learning"" dvd's do. The DVD's are done in such a way that he is immediately drawn to them and it repeats the numbers/letters/words over & over & over, but in a fun way with good graphical movements/noises/illustrations. I would recommend this as a ""booster"" product to your child's learning process."
5,preschool prep,Your child will definitely get a great start at learning with this product. I would recommend to all parents . Excellent.
5,preschool dvd,my kid master them - but even if they seem to slow for him he still watch them from time to time - very happy at age 3 he is counting know alphabet know colors and shapes - very helpfull if u dont have much time to teach your kid
4,Terrific Family Film!,"This movie is everything I was hoping for. Having never visited the Bahamas, it really gives you a sense of the culture of the area. All the performances are great in this CCH Pounder, who is in my favorite show Law & Order: SVU is fantastic. Definitely worth watching."
3,Rain,The movie was different. It was about more than one issue. They never really came out and said Whether the young girls Mother had HIV or not. The Mother did try to change and get her life together. It was kinda funny to me when the Mom went and sat in front of the Police station and started doing her drugs right in front of the officer. At first I was like what is she doing but I soon saw that she was asking for help with her drug problem so she got herself arrested. I think the movie was worth seeing.
2,Not what I expected,Yesterday evening was the first chance I got to watch this DVD. Ummmmmmm I fell asleep maybe halfway thru. What does that tell you?
3,So far- so good,The compressor has been performing well for regular household handyman use. Two negatives- very loud and the hose is junk. Buy a different hose and don't skimp....in the cold weather a stiff hose gets to be very annoying very quickly.
4,i loved it but,i loved itit is lightlots of airoil less so tossing in the truck was easywith oil lube i had to find a flat floor spotthis one just goes on top on its sidebut the noise wow this is one of the loudest by far
4,Searing Guitar,"A worthy addition to any blues/rock fan's collection. If you enjoy Pat Travers, Eric Gale, Tinsley Ellis and other guitar slingers in this genre, you'll want to give this one a listen!"
4,I already reviewd this item before.............???,"I will not reiterate as to what I wrote in my FIRST review about the transaction. I guess this time, someone wants to know ""What would I have wanted to know before I purchased this product?"" My answer is, nothing, as I already listened to excerpts from each song, I knew the price of the item, and how the seller was rated."
3,Linden posits a political agenda that spoils his argument,"Mr. Linden reviews the scientific evidence for sudden climatic change and correlates such rapid shifts in climate with abrupt declines of settlements and civilizations. He overreaches the evidence, however, with a thesis proposing that capitalism is the primary culprit in the progressive increase in concentrations of greenhouse gases and infers that socialism is an appropriate response to the threat."
3,From Boxing to the Circus,"If you've seen Kid Galahad (also with Humphrey Bogart) then you already know the story of Wagons Roll at Night. It's a remake which follows the same plot structure, but switches the subject from boxing to the circus. Bogart runs a circus, and Sylvia Sidney is his girlfriend / fortune teller. Eddie Albert joins the circus as a gifted lion tamer(!). Bogart doesn't have a high opinion of circus people (calls them gypsies), so he tries to keep his people away from his young sister, Joan Leslie. But it's not easy to keep Joan and Eddie apart. The performances are fine, and the use of the circus is an interesting switch from the original. The movie is short (84 minutes), and thus it moves along well. This is not one of Bogart's famous films, and it's hardly a classic, but it's an easy way to pass an hour and a half."
3,MEDIOCRE BOGART FLICK.,"This is actually a remake of the 1937 Bette Davis/Humphrey Bogart film KID GALAHAD; here the action is transformed from the boxing world to the circus world. In this one, Bogie's the owner of a run-down carnival which he desperately tries to keep his convent - schooled sis, Joan Leslie away from. By keeping her on a distant farm, he feels he can protect her from the evils that the carnival atmosphere breeds. Eddie Albert is hired by Bogart for the carnival because of the former's ease with which he fearlessly handled a lion - which escaped from the troupe - when it wanders into the general store where Albert works as a clerk. It isn't long before Leslie and Albert are an item...Sylvia Sidney is memorable as ""Madame Florina"" /AKA Flo Lorraine who reads both the Tarot and does crystal gazing as well. This isn't a bad little picture but it was released between HIGH SIERRA & THE MALTESE FALCON, so it was understandably quickly forgotton upon its initial release back in 1941."
3,Frustrated,"This product is great, but my problem was with the shipping.They're just not packing this properly.The customer service department was great in replacing the pad after I complained that it was damaged in shipping. But the replacement they sent out, was also damaged in shipping. Both times, the pad was smashed, creased, and wrinkled. I just wish they'd pack it more securely, instead of tossing it in a oversized plastic envelope. Maybe even just a well placed ""DO NOT BEND"" sticker would have helped."
4,Decent Paper at a Decent Price,"This paper met my expectations in every way and it was delivered quickly without damage. I became accustomed to using paper like this several decades ago when I was in high school, but it seems to be getting more and more difficult to find in most places that sell office supplies; the last time I thought I'd found some it turned to have different scales in the horizontal and vertical and neither one of then came out to any reasonable round number of squares to the inch or centimeter making it essentially useless. For this reason alone, the subject of this review was worth the price. It's a shame they don't offer this paper without the binding - then you wouldn't have to tear each sheet loose and wonder if it will be the one that rips in half as you do so."
2,New!: thread too thin snaps!,"As a math-and-physics literate person I'd say, ""not enough content to sustain the understated humour"" (or is it viceversa?).Maybe if the author had stopped at Chebishev (or whatever: the T is a French addition, as that language hasn't got the English ""ch"" sound, and represents it by ""tch""; the final ""f"" of ""ff"" are a mystery for me) and made it a brief sketch to be coupled with other 'mysteries' in a book, maybe if the monastic or Egyptian connections had been more fruitful ... .Towards the end I really lost interest, as the book meanders a little too much.Well, nice try."
2,Not worth the savings.,"This is a crappy battery - it drains down just while sitting in the camera. You charge it on friday, don't use it, it's dead by sunday. Constantly needs recharging."
5,"Christian, Cultural, Funniness","This movie made my wife and I both laugh... My wife and I found both the cultural humor mixed with Christianity uplifting and at times heard humor out of distress... This world needs this message, even if it kills them in laughter."
3,used for costumes,"I was in charge of costumes for a school play. Purchased 1 of these for ""Hans"" to wear. It served its purpose and will hopefully be used for many years to come as the 2nd grade does the play every year."
2,Where's the feather?,"I was a little upset when I received the hat today and realized that it doesn't come with a feather even though its advertised as a hat WITH a feather accessory. Is it really that hard to let me know the feather wasn't included? Its a quick fix for a last minute halloween costume but it would have been nice to receive what I ordered. Also, if you're looking for a grade A quality hat, look elsewhere. I knew it'd be a cheaply made hat for the price and expected such. I only need it for one night so its whatever."
3,huge!,"I ordered this hat for my 6 month old son's Halloween costume. He has a large head, but this hat is even too big on my husband. Not sure how I'm going to be able to get it to half its size."
4,cheap and it works!,"This goes on securely, its clear, it has a little bit of the ""cool kid stuck with headgear"" thing going for it, but it'll keep the phone safe, and it allows access to all the necessary speakers and ports and such, I'm stoked its this cheap too, get one!"
4,ALOT OF BANG FOR A BUCK,"For the wopping price of $1.00 you can't go wrong. It even comes with an extra clip. I ordered this and when I received it there was a crack and I sent and email to them and within one week they sent me a replacement. Thats customer service for you, it cost only one dollar and they had no problem replacing one that was damaged in shipping. I look forward to buying other products from them in the very near future."
1,v3 cystal case,there was something missing on the belt clip. there was no way to fasten the clip onto the phone.
2,dont recommend,"I HAVE USED SEVERAL OF THESE REPLACEMENT HEADBANDS AT SCHOOLS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS.THEY WILL LAST 0NE TO TWO SEASONS UNDER NORMAL USE.GROMMETS OFTEN COME LOOSE DURING INSTALLATION.UNFORTUNATELY THE ONLY DECENT REPLACEMENT COMES FROM DOUGLAS AND COSTS AROUND $70.YOU CAN OF COURSE PURCHASE A NEW NET FOR $160. IF YOU ARE DESPERATE TO COVER AN OLD COMPETELY WORN OUT FRAYED HEADBAND,THIS PRODUCT WILL GET YOU BY FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME."
5,Excellent quality tools for an incredible price,I've been growing and training bonsai off and on for years now and have used all kinds of tools with them. The average price of a decent concave cutter runs about $75 and the short shears cost on average $30. So I wasn't expecting much from this set. Was I wrong! Solid construction with excellent edges and tight fittings. I would easily compare the quality to just about any more pricey tool out there. Highly recommended!!
1,just say no,"I bought this locally because I couldnt wait to order something on-line. I wish I had waited and sprung for the Olympus TCON-17 instead.I cant take a clear picture to save my life, I do better just using my full zoom and post processing to blow up the image. Maybe on a lesser megapixel camera it would work, certainly dont use it on a 10MP camera like me.It was a good lesson I learned in buying cheap optics."
5,Excellent book for starters,This book teaches you everything you need to know to get started on using oracle for building web-based applications. Concepts are clearly explained and chapters are very concise and organized. Took me about a week to finish this book.
2,Should be more NT oriented,"The book's title is misleading. The Oracle 8i section is OK for starters, but the NT section is disappointing. It only takes one through the installation process and doesn't cover basic things like: how to create and drop NT services manually (a common problem), good 3rd party products for Oracle on NT like backup utilities, particular differences between NT and other platforms, problems with the installation of the RDBMS and other Oracle products. My opinion is that if the book's name is Oracle 8i on NT it should have more than one section on NT."
3,If you have nothing else available ...,"I bought this while I was in graduate school because I wanted to learn Oracle but neither my company or my school was using it. The key benefit of this book is the evaulation edition of Oracle 8i that comes with it. You'll probably learn more about Oracle from actually using it than you will learn any other way. That being said, this book isn't a good reference for learning basic concepts about relational databases. Since those concepts are very important, you will also need to find something which can help you learn them. Also, my book is also coming apart at the seams just like those of so many other reviewers."
5,Great Reference Guide for Systems Thinkers and Change Agents,"This book is a must-have guide of over 60 techniques for anyone implementing systemic change. The first part of the book gives a detailed overview of how to select methods, mix and match methods, and create sustainable results. The next part is a detailed section describing each of the methods, broken down into the following categories: adaptable methods, planning methods, structuring methods, improving methods, and supportive methods. There is also a section that gives quick one-page summaries of each method, including the following key information: purpose, outcomes, when and when not to use, number and type of participants, typical duration, and a brief example."
3,Uncommonly Good For A Sequel,"SEquels are notoriously disappointing in the Fantasy Genre but this one dodged the bullet. It did so by meticulously continuing where the first one left off and not a great refresher curve required.The mystery of what lies in the water and the growing focus on this makes one wonder at the title of the 'One Kingdom"" because we are headed for at least one more.I enjoy the continuation of the first book in that the ""magic"" and it's practitioners do not involve the main characters.There are few books where the main charecters are also not the focal practitioners of the sorcery, off hand I can think of only one author who writes that way and that is Guy Favrel Kay and in particular his stand alone novel of Tigana.All in all, Russell did well in this, not as well as the first novel of the series but better than the average sequel, and still delivered an interesting read.That is the bottom line is it not?"
3,Not as good as The One Kingdom,"When I read Book 1 of the Swann's War (which I give 5 stars! - rare for me), I was more enthralled than I'd been since reading Lord of the Rings many years ago. Though very different in tone, the sweep of the plot and the detail of Russell's characterization seemed as epic as Tolkien's. I couldn't wait for the second book, but it has proved disappointing. Though there was plenty of action, the primary point seemed to be to give more history rather than advance the plot or develop the characters. I am far less attached to the characters than I was initially. I hope Book 3 redeems the trilogy!"
3,"Not bad, but certainly not epic.","I picked up the first book in this series (The One Kingdom) on a half-price book list and found it entertaining enough to get the second. While I enjoyed the book and the pace and story continued to move along at a moderate pace, it wasn't anything overly exceptional. The book was much more of the same as the first, with no real ""surprises"" as in the first (where many more interesting and magical things are revealed) and very little ""oooh"" value.The book centers around the various parties coming together to escape the Stillwaters with Alaan at death's door all the while trying to avoid conflict with nemesis, Hafydd close on their heels. The entirety of the book takes place in the same, monotonous setting and the characters seem almost as dull - especially when so many end up being present all at once.A good enough read, but I can only hope that the next will pick up it's action. If not, the series will very quickly find itself mired in it's own swamp."
3,Swamplands,"The second book to the Swans' War was another solid book. More legendary characters introduced, and the affirmation of magic makes things fun. I really wasn't expecting the entire book to take place in the swamplands though, but they ended it with a bang. Story still taking many twists and is quite unpredictable, which is nice. Looking forward to reading the final book."
5,Very detailed and insightful. Like Japanese history? Then read this book!,"unless you read Japanese,(I asume that there are a few who can.) This is one of the best books on the market."
5,"Simple, cute, fun.","As far as toy irons go, this one is great. It's cute, simple, and seems to be good quality. I gave it 5 stars, which might seem like a high rating for such a basic toy, but as far as toy irons go, I believe this deserves it. It doesn't have the various settings other pretend irons have (the ones that look ""real""), but my daughter doesn't care. (if your child wants that, you should choose another model, one of the plastic ones--they have them on Amazon, too.) And this one has a cool retro appeal. Plus you can't beat the price."
5,Kid's love this product!!!!,I thought my granddaughter would like this but never dreamed about my 4 year old grandson enjoying it too!!!
1,Misleading Product Listing,"When I purchased this item, the photo and description showed a Schylling brand TOY iron. Most of the reviews are also for the toy iron I thought I was purchasing. However, I received a ""tin iron"" trading card instead and the image and description changed after my purchase. (The trading card is still listed as Schylling brand -- which sells the actual toy iron & some of the specs are still of the toy). Misleading product listing."
1,This was not the photo shown for the original post.,"This was NOT the original photo for the item when I purchased it. The photo shown was a toy iron, which is what I thought I was purchasing. There were even comments below that referred to the item as a child's toy iron."
1,The scatmat worked for a couple of months and then all of a sudden stopped working ... it was expensive and not worth the money!,Scatmat worked for a couple of months and then just quit working. It was too expensive and not worth the money!! They only allow refunds for 30 days ... within 3 months the scatmat completely quit working. I have changed batteries numerous times to no avail. Don't waste your money!
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,The scatmat's control box is NOT designed to accommodate a power cord of any kind. It takes 9V batteries only. I don't know why Amazon is wasting peoples' time with this.
1,Ours also goes off constantly,"We have so many of these mats that I thought adaptors would be a great way to save on batteries, but our 48x20 scat mat also went off every minute or two when used with the adaptor. The clicking would drive us crazy. The mats are against a wall and no one went anywhere near them. I bought both a 48x20 extension mat and the adaptor from Amazon at the same time, before the reviewer who says he had a similar problem had posted. I didn't know whether it was the extension or the adaptor at the time and was afraid it was going to zap out both mats because the adaptor was extremely hot where it was plugged into the wall."
3,dog ate thru it first day,my dog ate thru it the first day...so it didn't last long...think maybe it was more the scat mat intermittent charges that she figured out it wasn't a steady charge...no damage to the dog or mat..but now I am trying metal on my doors and jams.
2,It would be nice if it worked,Bought this for the ScatMatt Training Strip but it doesn't work with it. Amazon did send me a refund UPS label but what a waste of time!
4,power pack,Works great with scat mat---no need for a battery. Must use it near an outlet but cord is reasonably long.
4,More Brakhage works come to Criterion,"This DVD set includes more films by Stan Brakhage which focus on some of his longer films. This set is available by itself on DVD or on Blu-ray with Volume one included.Stan Brakhage was one of the most influential and acclaimed experimental filmmakers of the late 20th century. Many of his films are made by painting directly on celluloid. Some of the films here include other techniques such as multiple exposures and other methods. These films are quite good and are very interesting. If you have not bought volume one, I recommend getting the box set if you have a Blu-ray player.bonus features include archival interviews with Brakhage and videos of him speaking at the University of Colorado, audio interviews and the 2009 film ""For Stan"" made by his widow, Marilyn Brakhage."
4,Adequate Product,Basically it is okay but difficult to find at normal outlet's such as Frys.I will likely not order again but go to ink cartridge type machine.
4,Very Nice,"This has all the songs that drew people into the Simpsons and made them bother to watch ""All Singing, All Dancing"", one of the most hated clip shows. True, it doesn't have ""The Spring In Springfield"", but all the other memorable songs are on here, like ""Monorail"", ""We Do"", ""Who Needs The Kwik-E-Mart"" and ""See My Vest"". Some of of my personal favourites include ""Bagged Me A Homer"" and ""Baby On Board"". A must-have for Simpsons fans!"
5,Very pleasing the Simpsons soundtrack,I received the CD promptly and my kids love it. I had no problem dealing with this seller and would buy from him/her again.
5,Love the Simpsons,"In one episode of the Simpson, they had the stone masons singing a song.""We do."" Love the song and this CD has that song on it in full."
5,This is a Hell of a C.D!!!!!!,"This C.D rocks! My favorites inclued: ""Oh, SreetCar!"", ""the Monorail Song"" and ""Homer's Beer Song"". If you like The Simpsons, this C.D is for you!"
3,From Groening's Brain To Your CD Player,"While a bit heavy on the instrumentals, and missing ""key"" Simp-songs, ""Songs"" remains an homage to the long-running show, and to the composers, Danny Elfman and Alf Clausen's deft talents. It's also a reminder of the late Phil Hartmann's contributions to the show, and that his characters will be sorely missed. Fans not finding their favorites on this CD should check out ""Go Simpsonic,"" and give Dan Castellaneta's ""Two Lips,"" a good listen, as well."
5,The best Simpsons CD I ever heard!!!,"Thois si the best CD ever made about the simpsons. I heard it at my freinds house and I wish they would let people listent to some of it with realplayer, because this is so good they would probably make 1,000s of new customers.the best CD for any Simpsons fan"
4,"Good, but where's the Sherry Bobbins (Mary Poppins) Songs",This is a brilliant CD for anyone who likes the hilarious and catchy Songs of Springfield. Though there are all the good songs except the Sherry Bobbins episode tunes like 'we are happy with things the way they are' or ' If you cut every corner . . .' and 'Buy me a beer . . .'. There are a huge amount of boring Simpson theme tune tracks but the rest of the brilliant songs makes up for this.
5,Excellent for any Simpsons Fanatic,"Even if you're not a Simpsons Fanatic, chances are you'll love this CD anyway. About the only person that won't like this CD are the Simpsons-haters. The whole show is just hilarious!"
3,"This a pretty cool Cd, but not as good as the other ones.","This a cool CD, but not what a Simposon fan would call the greatest Simpons CD. Most of the tracks are only a minnute or so long and a lot of them have more talking than actual singing. I am a major Simpons fan and I would like to say that if you are going to by a Simpsons Cd, by SIMPONS SING THE BLUES. If you listen to this Cd it is prett good but not the best."
5,the simpsons are great!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"my favorite tv show,you must buy this cd,there are so many songs,if you like the simpsons you will recognize all the songs,and if you don't like them you will get fun with the lirycs"
5,Want funny versions of fave tunes w/o killing the songs?,"Have you ever seen or heard Iron Butterfly's classic, ""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,"" played on a church pipe organ? Have you heard Falco's ""Rock Me Amadeus"" being sung as ""Dr. Zaius"" by the cast of a ""Planet of the Apes"" musical? Have you ever heard music from a ""Streetcar named Desire"" musical? If you answered no to any of these questions, you haven't experienced the Simpsons' ""Songs in the Key of Springfield."" Of the 39 tracks, these are my faves (in no order):""In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,"" ""Dr. Zaius"" (part of ""A Fish Called Selma"" medley), ""Send in the Clowns,"" ""It Was a Very Good Beer,"" ""Itchy and Scratchy"" theme, and ""Senor Burns.""This album is a must for all Simpsons fans and the kinds of people who like weird renditions of their favorite tunes (forget Pat Boone, Hayseed Dixie, and Lounge Against the Machine)."
5,GREAT new band -- GREAT album!,I heard this band live once -- and couldn't wait to hear them again. The album lives up to their terrific live performance and will appeal to a wide audience. Buy it!
5,Matchbox 20 meets the Red Hot Chili Peppers,"What a GREAT CD! I totally agree with the other 2 reviewers who mentioned Rob Thomas & Matchbox 20. That was my impression after listening to the 1st few tracks. Then a little further into the CD, some of the funk-style reminded me of the Chilli Peppers. I found myself cranking up the volume & pounding out the beats on my steering wheel. Haunting vocals, driving drumbeats, clean guitar. Buy this CD. You won't be disappointed!"
4,A Great Discovery,"I bought this album simply because of the band's interesting name and cover. WOW was I impressed with the sophisticated rock on this album! It was such a nice change from the pop or hard core rock that seems to be the only thing on the radio these days. Their lyrics are that of a mature musicians (no ""Bye, Bye, Bye"") and their harmonies are remenicent of King's X. If you like anything by Rob Thomas and Matchbox Twenty or Third Eye Blind, you will definately love this album!"
5,Great CD,"This was one of the best CDs I've bought in a while. I wasn't expecting a new band to be this good. All of the songs are really good when I was only expecting one song to be good, ""One Sun"". It's a CD worth buying."
1,A little gloss and no bite,This album suffers like many POP albums do by limiting itself to banal lyrics and less than enthusiastic melodies. The productions sounds good but its like watching an action movie that has the look but not the writing. Its OK but not enough to put down dollars down on it.
5,"""The Girlfriends Guide to Working at Home""","As a newbie to the WAHM world, I really enjoyed this book and found it helpful and encouraging. Cheryl has such a great sense of humor - I loved all of the analogies she uses throughout the book and the stories she shares about her kids, who are pretty funny, too. She reassures you that being home with your kids really is worth it - whether you are stressed out or haven't seen the light of day in weeks. After reading this book I finally felt excited and motivated about being a WAHM instead of nervous and scared. Thanks, Cheryl, for the inspiration!"
5,Can't Put It Down,"As soon as I received my copy of this book I dove right into it. I am half way through it and can already tell you that it is definitely one the better books on work-at-home advise. Cheryl Demas does not write in mumbo-jumbo terms and uses real-life scenarios. I could relate to almost every example of a WAHM I have read in the book so far. The input from other WAHMs is also very helpful and encouraging, I realized I am not alone in struggles of balancing family and work.I recommend this book to anyone (not just Moms) who is considering a home-based business, if for nothing else, it's encouraging and inspirational aspect."
3,A bit large for the camera I have.,"Make sure you want a large case than the camera, before you order this one, Price is excellent thoguh."
2,THis is more a long journal article than a book,"I found the book to be long, drawn out, and lacking in substance.Technological determinism is the point. It could have been made in10 pages."
3,A little harsh ...,"No one said that the Three Tenors were the three greatest tenors of all time, or even of their time. It doesn't take extraordinary cleverness to discern that Neil Shicoff sings better. In that sense, Ciampa's book ""The Twilight of Belcanto"" is filled with the obvious.However, I cannot tell a lie. I was told, ""You have to buy this book; it's a must-own."" Having bought and read it, I agree that it is. Ciampa is formidable on the topic of ""beautiful singing."" You can almost hear Gigli's ""mezza voce"" as you read about it. Though not without a tinge of reluctance (annoyance, even), I recommend that every opera lover is at some point going to have to purchase a copy of this book."
5,The definitive book on the topic.,"What a surprise! A book by a minor publisher, written by a hitherto unknown author -- who, incidentally, is only in his 30s. This is the most profound, comprehensive, and UNDERSTANDING book on the topic of ""good singing."" What is ""good singing""? This book will permanently drill into you the answer to that question. Warning: you will suddenly realize how much of today's singing is NOT good.Easily the best opera book of 2005."
5,Belcanto and the Ashkenazik hazzanim???????,"The Three Tenors. Renee Fleming. Bocelli. That is NOT what this book is about. What a PLEASURE to read the colorful interview with Virginia Zeani, and to read about the careers of Leyla Gencer, Jan Kiepura, Tagliabue, ALL of the great, grand singers who didn't happen to make a ""name"" quite as big as Lucianissimo's.But by far the most unexpected and interesting part of the book is an entire section where Mr. Ciampa, with surprising convinction and persuasion, makes a direct connection between the Italian Belcanto and Minhag Ashkenaz. As an opera lover who happens to be Jewish, I don't see how one could not read this chapter. I don't recall that anyone else has ever covered it, or even thought about it.One of the truly great opera books in my library."
5,service,"I am very happy with the service and response of this company. I ordered the item, a hard to find book, and got it in a few days time. It was in very good condition, and I got what I needed fairly timely."
4,Zip750 Drive: amazon.com,"I received this item quickly, but have not had time to install my computer that it will be connected to. Previously, I had an Iomega 250 mb drive that worked great. However, the computer that I am about to retire is about 9 years old, and it came with an Iomega 750 mb drive internally. My main use for this drive is to submit digital photos to our local newspaper on a regular basis."
5,I love reading this to my daughter,"I saw this and had to scoop it up for my baby girl. I think the older she gets (5 months old now), the more she will enjoy this book over the years. It will be a classic in our family for sure!"
3,Beautiful Book,"I love the illustrations, but my daughter rarely asks me to read it. This is why I gave it three stars."
4,beautiful little book,"I remember loving this book as a child despite not being very ""churchy."" It was such a pretty little book and the message was very simple and sweet, I think it is a nice book even for non-christians as it really has a very humanist message about respect and love and nature and everything being connected and such. Could really be explained to fit any religion/world-view. Love the diversity in the newer edition and despite what some have said about the children looking ""creepy"" and too fakey/wide-eyed/etc I think it is beautifully illustrated."
5,awsome is the best way to discribe this album..a must buy,you dont hear too much different stuff any more . and they dont play these guys on the big radio stations why????? this band is gonna be big!!!!
4,She is woman Feel her Kicks :),"A real good movie i thought, with some excelllent action, and a female star that blows you away. The story is complex, and pretty serious. Young girl is raped while her husband is murderd in front of her, she then is rescued by a female shaolin priest, who teaches her Dragon fist. Once she finishes her training she leaves and plans revenge on all that hurt her. She seeks revenge on a group of bandits led by a man called golden hair, the master of the 2 fist boxer style. After taking out a couple of the goons, she is beaten. but before she is fataly hurt she is saved by a lame legged female master who takes her in and teaches her the deadly kicks, one method of counter acting golden hair. While training she also invents her own style the Monkey in a tree method which she plans to be very important. Super fight scenes and a great main character (not to mention cute:)) a tough ruthless villian with a very unique deadly style, and a strong story. Go girl"
4,A real lady warrior,"This movie is ok, I liked it at the end. I thought it should have been better though, but it is a good movie. If you like watchin a female kick some guys butt watch this movie!"
1,Jesus Christ Superstar Soundtrack,"I had the ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" soundtrack on LP back when I was younger (in the 1970's). It was amazing. I thought I was purchasing that same soundtrack, but was I ever disappointed. This one is not done by the same artists. The talent of the artists on this soundtrack is at least one notch below the oringinal that I had years ago. I would not have purchased it if I had known what I know now."
2,Coca-Cola Classic vs New Taste of Coke,"Why would Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice want their excellent original version be destroyed like that. Of course, if you are producing a stage show, you can't use the original cast members for ever. But why produce a new studio version that basically tries to copy the original ( except for a few lyrical changes that add nothing) but fails miserably because of an irritating cornyness that was not present in the original. If it's financial, then it's bloody money and you are damned for all time."
4,Worth Hearing,"A good CD for a collection. Steve Balsamo's ""I Only Want to Say"" is well done, but his lyrical phrasing in other songs is not as effective. Zubin Varla (Judas Iscariot) and David Burt (Pontius Pilate) shine, but Joanna Ampil is a weak Mary Magadalene. For my money, and that includes the recent Broadway revival with Glen Carter, Ted Neeley is still the Superstar."
2,Phantom of the Jesus,"Too much opera, not enough rock. When I bought this recording, I expected to hear Jesus Christ Superstar, not Phantom of the Opera! Gone are Ian Gillan's dynamics, from sweet, soft, tender, vocals to intense, high-pitched, screaming vibratos. Replaced instead with someone who would be better served playing the role of ""Cherubino"" in the Marriage of Figaro. Murray Head, while perhaps not the worlds best vocalist, brought passion and a lot of emotion to the part of Judas. Zubin Varla brings a bunch of right notes, but little else. I've had this recording for over a year now and despite several attempts, (the most recent one bieng last night) I've only made it to the end once. I simply find this version unlistenable. If you've never heard the original or simply didn't like it, you may find this one to your liking. As for me... I grew up with the original version and sadly, have found all other renditions I have heard to be musical blasphemy!"
2,I JUST DON'T GET IT,"THIS CD ALWAYS REMINDS ME OF THE LONDON LYCEUM REVIAL PRODUCTION. TRUST ME, YOU DO NOT WANT TO SEE WHAT THAT LOOKED LIKE..SINGING IS OK.BAD JUDAS.GREAT JESUS.COOL LYRICS.COOL HEROD.COMPLETE SETWHAT MORE CAN I SAY? LOOK, IF YOU ARE DYING FOR A COMPLETE LONDON JCSS CD, YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET THIS. IF YOU ARE LIKE ME AND LIKE THE HIGHLIGHTS AND THE CONCEPT CD, YOU MIGHT NOT WANT TO GET THIS."
1,A waste of money!,"After listening to this recording, I was thoroughly disappointed. I should have bought the Karoke version and let my son recite the words. Nearly all of the lyrics were spoken instead of sung. Get the original cast recording."
5,An excellent modern-day recording....,".... of a classic rock opera. Alice Cooper shines as King Herod, and David Burt as Pilate nearly steals the show with his sneering, yet compassionate depiction of the Roman whose silence put Jesus to death. Zubin Varla does a good turn as a passionate Judas--his voice breaks as he sings Judas' reprise of ""I Don't Know How to Love Him."" In addition, Joanna Ampil as Mary Magdalene is one of the best Marys I've ever heard. Her voice is sweet and pleasant to listen to, a real pleasure. The only slightly sour note in an otherwise pleasant production is Judas' harshness in some songs, and Steve Balsamo's Jesus gets high-pitched and effeminate-sounding in some songs. Fans of the movie's Ted Nealy will likely appreciate Balsamo's production. But the sound quality is excellent, and this is truly a wonderful recording!"
5,Best. Jesus. Ever,"Say what you will about the ""musical theater"" pedigree that runs through this show, there is *no* way you can listen to Steve Balsamo's ""Gethsemane"" and think anything other than WOW. His falsetto is obviously more classical than rock, but there is nothing that can compare to that high note he holds out for eight bars at the end of ""Gethsemane."" Truly one of the most impressive things I've ever seen from a male vocalist, and I have an extensive background in musical theater. If for no other reason, get the recording to hear what I consider the most musically talented man to ever take the ""Jesus"" mantle"
1,Wayyyyyy overproduced. :(,"this version completely lacks the amazing classic rock character of the original. the dirty sounding fender precision bass, the completely dry recorded drums, the twangy naturally distorted electric guitars. the 1970s original cast recording has much, much more character."
3,Too Technical for my taste...,"I was hoping to find a release of JSC with Yvonne Eliman's version of ""Can we start again please?"" I received this one instead.While the music and the orchestra are powerful, overall, I disagree with the other reviewers. The ability to hold a note for as long as he (Steve Balsamo) did in ""Gethesmane"" was impressive but I didn't find his performance nearly as moving as some of the Jesus's before him. And while Joana Ampil has a beautiful and sweet sounding voice, she is not Mary Magdalene material. Yvonne Eliman has been by far the best MAry Magdalene ever! Her voice is beautiful and she was able to capture the sultriness essence of her character. Joanna as do most of the other performers on the release sound much too technical and sound awkward trying to sing rock opera. Too much ennunciation and diction used--they need to relax their tongues or something a little more."
4,Superstar,"I ordered this product for a friend. They had never heard of the show. (I know crazy right.) They really liked it and now it is part of their ""musiacl rotation""."
1,WARNING!!!!!!,WARNING to all who love this album like I do. This is NOT the original Ian Gillen/Murray Head version. I just blew $18 bucks to hear a bunch of cheezy sound-a-likes.
2,Jesus Christ Superstar,"I would have liked to know that this was not the original ""Superstar"", the words have been changed in many of the songs. An altogether dissapointing CD!"
1,great saw....BAD BATTERIES,"buy the lith ion version, by now the whole world knows the 18 v NiCads are junk......"
2,Can't Bring Myself To Buy It.,"I really wanted a jazz version of some EJ hits, but sorry, that seems to be the hardest word, since I cannot bring myself to buy it after hearing the sample of ""All The Young Girls Love Alice.""The version on this CD is brutally painful to my ears. C'mon, it's a song about wives using a young girl to perform sex acts, and here it is turned into elevator music. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!"
2,"Overall good, but small problem","Paper quality and reinforcement is great... however, not all of the holes are punched all the way through. Some you can poke and the paper pops out but others you have to re-punch and my hole punch doesn't line up properly. Really slows you down when you're trying to fill binders quickly. If they fix this slight glitch it would be a five star rating... I would have returned the item but at this point I'm in a time crunch."
4,Stuff is necessary...,pretty much necessary for a college student taking a lot of hand-written notes...regular paper just rips out of binders instantly -- disorganizing your entire semester. Definitely recommend these to keep a tidy notebook for a LONG time. Mine have even lasted years in storage being thrown around in a box.5-star is a little overpriced when Staples makes their own brand.
3,Not very strong.,"Much better than overly thin looseleaf that gets shredded by closing a binder, but still easy to rip loose. I'll keep buying it because I don't know of alternatives, but I wish the reinforcement was stronger."
1,Not good as expectation,"There were 8 stores with price from $3.03 to $5.29 each pack. I ordered 8 packs of $3.03, and paid extra handling fee $8.82. Delivery was very fast on next day than they promised for 4-6 days. But the package and the paper was different than what I saw on web and what I bought from Walmart before, The reinforce plastic is very weak. Very disappointed."
4,Of mixed mind,"This has advantage of not needing other reinforcers, but it is expensive compared to paper without reinforcers. I found myself telling the kids not to waste them, such as doodling or as a work paper. It almost defeats the purpose of being a notebook paper."
3,not right colors,the side that is reinforsed is blue not pink and i was hoping that the lines would be thinner but they werent
4,Great Gift for Grandmas,"I've searched for Jean Nate for my Mom, who is 93 and thank goodness for the internet and Amazon. I was able to buy 4 boxes for very reasonable prices. My mother is staying at a great assisted living facility in Wilton Connecticut and she mentioned to her friends that I bought Jean Nate from Amazon and they are ready to order both for themselves and for the boutique store they have on premises."
1,Talc is linked to CANCER,"I thought about buying this product for my grandma and then I did a quick search of the ingredients online and found that, ""Talc is closely related to the potent carcinogen asbestos. Talc particles have been shown to cause tumors in the ovaries and lungs of cancer victims."" from [...]"
5,ordered as a gift,I ordered this as a gift for my mother and she just loves it. I myself am not a big fan of Jean Nate fragrances but as long as my mother loves it that is all that matters.
2,Be careful before buying,Please note that the producr description says 6-pack. But myofficesource sent me just one. They say Amazon is making a mistake by clubbing and confusing the items. Not sure who is right. myofficesource asks for astronomical shipping charges and they dispatched item only after several calls and long after I got mail it was shipped. I am finding this item very hard to procure at a reasonable price. I have returned the item and I hope I get full refund.
1,Worst product ever,Save your money! This has got to be the lousy-est product I've tried in a long time. Right after I attached the pad to the handle and started to use it--it fell off. This happened repeatedly. I bundled the rest to put in the trash. This is also cumbersome to use when trying to attach the pad to the little velcro strips on the handle piece. Wish I had my money back. Aghhhhh!!!
5,Great original blues,"Being a big Elvis fan and knowing that Bill Broonzy & Arthur Crudup were the King's 2 favorites when he was young, I was curious what his influences sounded like. I had already heard Crudup. Well Big Bill did not disappoint. Fantastic stuff."
3,EH............ Did you say something?,"My heater arrived yesterday. One of the warmer days we've had. But I wanted to use it anyway. It works nicely, BUT IT IS LOUD. My air compressor can not even drown out the noise, but I will get used to it as I do wear ear protection when I operate the machines in my shop. The thermostat controlled shutdown and start-up is a plus."
2,"Started out great, not happy 23 months later",I have had this heater for 2 years. The first two winters it worked flawlessly so when I wanted to start using it for this year I figured it would fire right up and keep my garage warm so I could work in there.Well the fan comes on the spark ignites but no flame. When looking at the fuel lines they were all cracked and almost broken in half. They must have used really crappy fuel lines as I used the correct fuel for the unit Kerosene. Looks like I wil have to take apart the unit and replace all the fuel and air lines. I would figure this would be the least of my problems fuel lines. Hell fuel lines last for decades on automobiles. Seems like they used really cheap materials on this unit. I am holding my breath to see if other parts are as crappy as the fuel/air lines.
3,Rocket FM,"It took some tweaking to get this gadget to operate correctly. I pried open the case and placed the wire out the top. That really helps with the reception. I also purchased a amplified fm antenna at Best Buy for the stereo that I wanted to transmit to. Also fiddling with the volume controls really improves the reception. It's not what I expected as far as reception goes, but for the money it will suffice"
4,"Easy installation, Good sound when you're close","Installed on Vista with no problems. Will transmit to a couple rooms, but that's about it. If the antennae is close enough, sound is good."
5,Internet radio all around your home,"this is one of the web's best kept secrets. The fm rocket allows you to transmit any internet radio station from your computer to your home fm radios in stereo! this adds hundreds of options, including international stations, for your listening pleasure. definitely worth the price. [[ASIN:B0007NWM06 Griffin RocketFM / FM Transmitter for Mac and PC Computers]"
4,Good Value- Hint for improving reception,"Very easy to install. As other reviewers noted, it's important to make sure that you appropriately set Windows' volume levels. The received sound quality is fairly good, in the low to medium fidelity range. You can signicantly improve the range and quality of the transmiited signal by carefully prying open the case and bending the antenna so that it comes out of the top of the case in a vertical position. (I'm sure that this will void the warranty)."
4,Nifty FM Transmitter,"Looking for an inexpensive way to get sound from your PC to your stereo system without wires? Try this gadget! It plugs into your output of your PC (or if you have an additional headphone output) and transmits the signal via FM that can be picked up by your stereo system. There is software you install, allowing you to change what frequency it transmits. Advantages: it's fast and easy. Disadvantages: it becomes another sound driver for your PC. This may not be a problem for some folks, though. The signal strength really depends on how many walls it must go through before your FM radio picks it up. Experimentation is the key."
4,It does well in MS.,"I had to fuss with this for a bit to find a radio station that worked well for both the radios in my house. It functions very well and does what I want it to...as long as I use Windows. I should have checked before I bought it, but I have been unable to find any linux drivers for it. That's my fault, but it is a flaw that kept it from getting 5 stars. Most people I know who would use this type of device have dual boot systems."
1,Beautiful item....that doesn't work.,"This could potentially be fantastic if it worked...but it didn't even come close. I got zip. Bupkis. Nada. If it had cost a bit more I would have returned it, as it was it was just a lesson in ""try before you buy."""
2,Nice idea that doesn't work very well,"As a basic tool to get your audio from your laptop to your stereo, this device is fine, but don't expect very good sound quality under any circumstances. It installed quickly and effortlessly on my machine, but even when I moved my computer and Rocket FM device two feet away from my high quality receiver with a good FM antenna, the static and drop outs and other distortion were constantly noticable."
5,Works very well in the car,"I bought this item to enjoy the car laptop mount I got for Christmas. Put the laptop on the stand, plug in the RocketFM, press the memory button on the radio and I'm done. Now I can listen to/browse my 60GB collection of music. Plug in the external drive and now I've got 120GB of video/TV/movies. Find an access point, and now I can stream my Orb (orb.com) media. And all the audio comes through my alpine head unit and pioneer speakers, and it sounds great! I will say, it does help to have chunks of low spectrum to use (88-91 works great). Over powering commercial stations is, as far as I've seen, impossible. In my experience with the RocketFM, the higher the frequency, the worse it gets. I use 88.7 (which does have a college station on it) in mono, and it works upto about 25-30 feet away."
5,Works as advertised,"I'm not sure why other people are having problems with this but it works fine. Granted I live in a 1-bedroom apartment and have no expectation to be able to get reception with this 3 rooms away. I can put on last.fm or pandora or any other internet radio or mp3s and listen in the kitchen or the stereo in the living room without having to listen through the crappy laptop speakers, which is what I wanted. The long cable allows you to position it higher up on a bookshelf or so for better reception.For comparison, I also have a Belkin FM transmitter and I used to use it with rechargeable batteries and the range of that was paltry compared to the RocketFM (just a few (5-10) feet away the reception would fade out. And forget about walking across the room or accidentally sitting in between stereo and transmitter). Plus, I'd be in for new batteries every 4-5 hrs. This device gets its power from the USB plug so it's great."
5,Does the job,"I got tired of the local radio stations, so dedicated my office computer to streaming an NPR station in another part of the country. My office is in a detached garage, about 50' from the house. I set the Rocket up in a window sill facing the back of the house, and the signal reaches all the radios downstairs. It has trouble reaching my jambox upstairs, but there's only so much one can expect (and I suspect that the receiver on the jambox isn't so great anyway). When I have a party, I stream a jazz station and it pipes through all the radios of the house. I'm very satisfied and have been for 2 yrs. Not sure why this little gem was discontinued."
1,Won't work with Intel Macs. Discontinued by manufacturer. Avoid.,"I returned this item that same day it arrived. After launching the required software for the first time, I got a pop-up error message that said ""software is not compatible with Intel-based Macs."" This is a major incompatibility for for a huge percentage of mac owners, and it was not mentioned anywhere in the Amazon product info or specification. Furthermore, when I went to the manufacturer's website (Griffin Technology), I discovered that the product had been discontinued. Also not mentioned by Amazon."
3,Good but not for music,Transmitter working good. Vista - no problem. But sound(music) is not very clear. It is good for PC game's sounds.
3,Price cut at the manufacturer web page,I was ready to buy this product from Amazon but then I saw the manufacturer web page and they have a special price: US$ 9.99.This is a lot cheaper than US$ 34 from Amazon.I think Amazon should cut this product priceND
2,I didn't use it.,I sent it back after reading the instructions. It seems that every time I would have to change from listening to tunes at my coputer to the use of the transmitter I would have to change the values in Start->Control Panel->Sounds and Audo Devices to use it and then change them back when I was at my computer. I didn't want to do that each time. I have no experience in the effectiveness since I didn't actually use the transmitter.
1,Simple to use but poor signal.,"The Rocket FM transmitter was as easy as a mouse to set up and get running. The tuning app is about as easy as software gets to use.However, no combination of orientation of the transmitter and receiver and frequency I tried managed to get a range of more than about 4 feet, usually a LOT less.I see now why it was in the ultra discount bin at the record store. I will be returning it and would not pay $5 for it."
2,Background sound and...,"It's very difficult to find a free frequency in Canada. The sound is not clean, there is always a background sound. Good luck to find a way to place the RocketFM. If you move the wire or the RocketFM around the computer, the sound is good or very bad."
2,Not really impressed,"I'm not really impressed with the Griffin RocketFM. I purchased this unit for the sole purpose of hearing my streaming XM radio on my laptop into the other room. For some reason, this unit doesn't like Windows media streams. If I launched iTunes or something else, all went well. After Griffin customer service giving me the run around for nearly two weeks, they finally came to the explanation that it was just the program I was using. I doubt a streaming program made by XM would be THAT flawed. Definitely not impressed with this product at all. It's going in the closet with all the broken stuff."
4,Griffin RocketFM review,"Product is exactly as advertised and easy to set up. Performance is o.k, but range is less than advertised in a home."
2,FM Rocket Fizzle,"Great looking on desk, Performance good, but not great.Performs task w/ short distances, doesn't like much interference."
2,Save your cash,"Save your money. I am still searching for a good transmitter but this one is not it. This unit is supposed to transmit up to 30 feet. I can't get it to transmit a very good signal more than 10 feet, and I live in a regular stick built house. If I stick it within 3 feet of the stereo I get decent sound but there is still a bit of crackle that is noticeable on slower acoustic type songs. I have been to the website for the unit and tried all the tips. I don't know what else to recommend but this is a bad solution for music, but may be O.K. for talk shows or something."
2,Week signal,"It took a couple of hours of fiddling with this device to actually get it to transmit. Once that was worked out, the signal was too weak to give good sound quality on either of the stereos in my house. One of which is 15-20' away from the transmitter.I had this hooked up to the USB2 port on the back of my computer (ie, no usb hub), so it should have been able to get enough power. I would prefer it if they at least offered the option of using a power adapter to get more signal out of it."
2,PRY OPEN THE CASE,"okay, so I bought this thing 6 months ago, and stopped using it due to frustration with constant static and noise when I moved it. Sitting on my couch, 15 feet away from my stereo (a nice one) and it can't get across the room without sounding crappy? FAIL.But, today I read the review suggesting to pry the case open and free the antenna - this made ALL the difference. the case will close again, just pry it open and pull the metal antenna out into the air.All in all I wouldn't buy it again, since the antenna will probably break off soon enough, but for now that at least salvages the purchase."
1,Dissaponited,I Was very dissaponited with this product!!The first thing is the range. I can barley get 5ft. away.The Next thing is I have to put a radio next to my computer instead of computer speakers.Also it does not come with updated software I searched the internet with little luck.
2,Bad Punk Rock,"In Mxpx's ""pokinactha"" they show that they are a young band that needs improvement and they do later so instead of picking this one up get ""Going Slowly the Way of the Buffalo"" or ""Life in General""."
2,MxPx: A great band but Polkinatcha is not one of their best,MxPx is the greatest Punk band out there today. Polkinatcha is their first full length album and it shows. The sound of this album just doesn't compare to their newer albums. Don't get me wrong there are some great songs but overall I think you could go without this one in your collection.
4,My Review (duh),"MxPx is a great band. This first cd ""Pokinatcha"" shows that they are good, but they need a little improvement. If you like Green Day, NOFX, or other punk/pop-punk bands, you will like this cd."
2,Worst MxPx CD,Before I heard this CD I listened to Life in General and Let It Happen and loved them but this CD is nowhere near as good as any of their other CDs. I highly recommend all other MxPx Cds except for this one.
2,Best thing about the book is the free MS VC++ CD ROM,"Its an OK Book but is too basic. The most complicated subect matter is probably pointers. I'd say get this book (for the CD rom) then get another book that has some serious code. Oh yeah, and the author could have done much better with the input functions. He used CIN and they are useless. cin.getlines would have been much more appropriate."
4,Excellent book for beginners,Good book for beginners. Even if have never touched a programming language before this can get started. The author has some DOS specific commands in his programming. So it limits you in that respect. If you can figure out where to take out the DOS stuff you can use it on any platform.
1,Didn't work for me,"(My version came with a limited version of borland C++ 1.0 on floppy disk.) I guess this book worked for some beginners, but I found it extremely awful. When I picked up this book I had no programming experience what so ever (I never even used DOS). I wanted to learn C on my own though so I was determined to do it. I read each and every chapter about 3 or 4 times trying to learn all the concepts but it was really agonizing. One thing books like this should mention is a basic understanding of algebra being suggested, I'm sure that would have helped me. I will say however that once I did completed this book the C class I eventually took in college wasn't nearly as bad. At least it made me familiar with C and programming. If you've never done any programming what so ever buy something else is all I can say (I hear C for Dummies is good)."
2,So it's Great...Why? What's it do?,"Is there any reason that someone in the Geek Technolocutional department cannot give an English translation of what these gismos do? Can someone tell me that if I don't buy this item, the keyboard will not work properly? Can someone explain in English if my midi cable has an extra letter in the serial code, WHY it won't work? Come on guys, give a keyboard wannabee a break!"
1,Waste of money,It didn't work and I had to order the interface right from the manufacturer.Thanks for nuttin'
5,Magnificent,"Music is an important part of my life and Al Caiola has been a part of that from the time I was able to earn my own money to buy my first LP which coincidently was Al's ""Tuff Guitar"". I still have about ten vinyl albums of Al Caiola which I have loved for years but when I came across this compilation album I grabbed it. The feeling of well being that came over me from the first listen is repeated each and every time I put it on. This is truly feel good music from an artist who has specialised in sublime guitar solos for over thirty years. I love it and you will too."
5,These appear to be at least 13 of his 41 songs from 1949-1952.,"You can tell by the song titles. There are at minimum, 27 different releases on 24 different labels of his Swing Time & Down Beat Recordings from 1949-1952 when he was 19 to 22 years old. The great beauty of these songs is that he sounds like a man, not a kid and when there's horns they blast. 'I'm Goin' Down To the River' and 'All To Myself Alone' are both so emotional. The first one's a suicide note cuz he lost his love. This is the sweet stuff, before Atlantic Records which is great stuff. This is his earliest material and well worth it. There's apparently 41 to 42 released songs from this period and they appear on 1) The Complete Swing Time & Down Beat Recordings 1949-1952, 2) Ray Charles 45 Great Performances and 3) Mess Around. All three are 2xCD sets. This stuff rocks, in the classic Ray way."
2,Help!,"Help, please! My lettuce is wilting after 2 days. What am I doing wrong? I washed it, used the spinner just a little, into the bag and into the fridge."
2,Love gadgets .... but not this one!,"I used this once and will probably never use it again. It's may be a good product for some, but I found that by the time I cleaned and dried my greens, that it didn't keep them any more fresh than a regular plastic bag. It might work if you want to keep them for a while, but they don't last that long in my house. If I have clean greens, they'll be gone in a few days anyway."
2,soggy salad saver,"Major problem is having to completely dry the washed greens before inserting in salad saver; unless greens are completely dry, they wilt in the bag. It is less problematic to do it the old fashioned way."
5,Silvermark Microfiber Salad Bag,"I love this product. It really does keep salad greens fresh for a week or so. I wash the greens in cold water, put the pieces in the bag, tie it up and put it in my crisper drawer. I pull out the salad greens as I need them. They are always crispy and fresh tasting. I hand wash the bag every so often and let it drip dry. I recommend this. It saves money on salad greens or any fresh veggies."
1,didn't work for me,"My salads got too wet and had to be discarded. Didn't like idea of cloth bag. Have better luck with the green bags,"
4,Go Ask Ogre Review,"I was truly moved by the book, there were many things I could relate to and I know that the coming of age is never easy, but when writers such as Jolene share their youth amoung strangers we as readers are left with a sense that things may get better in time. The fact that what the readers are reading was written by a teenager, makes it much more tangible for a younger reader. It's well written and touching, it's very real."
3,Diary of a Typical Teen,"Siana is my people. I lived in her world and shared her musical tastes at the same point in history. I reveled in her accounts of the Skinny Puppy shows she attended and felt her excitement at any contact with Ogre, whether in print or in person. However, the title and jacket suggest more drama than actually unfolds. Because the contents of this book are exactly as it says: ""letters"", with the occasional journal entry to fill in the blanks, I felt as though I was left with a lot more ""blanks"" that needed to be filled. Her epilogue helps to smooth over some of the questions in my mind, but in the end I was left feeling a little flat."
5,This is One of those Rare Books You'll Remember Reading,"Jolene Siana's collection of letters and artwork sent to Ogre, from the band Skinny Puppy, is a moving chronicle of a girl's struggle to find place and meaning for herself at an age that is normally awkward at best. I found great beauty in this very human quest for self discovery and identity."
2,nice idea. but disapointed,"well basically i really wanted them to organize my desk, i dont know why but i was tricked by the picture i thought that the ""tray"" was the two layers stacked together .. i was very dissapointed four days and 13 bux later to find out i only had one part, its not even worth my time to return ill just have to go to office max myself to buy the other half , cuz im sure as heck not paying another 10 bux for a piece of plastic they make for pennies.. basically i just feel they should change the picture because the picture implies you are buying two, and would not be 5 dollars like they imply."
5,World of Cats 1000 piece puzzle,"If you are a cat lover, you will enjoy working this puzzle. It's not easy, but it is so interesting to see all the different breeds of cats, that it will keep at it until you have finished the entire picture. This puzzle is very detailed, and arrived in a timely manner and in great shape. This is a great quality puzzle and it is also very educational."
2,Not one of Landis's better books,"I've read and loved every one of Landis's books, but this one is the worst. It's slow-moving, downright boring in parts, and sometimes unbelievable. I don't like weak heroines, and this one is a gullible twit. I couldn't even finish this book.... the last seven chapters were only skimmed. The only thing that kept me from abandoning it altogether was the fact that I can't stand leaving a book unfinished."
1,"i buy this item,so haven a problem,,the number six[6] in the scale coming down,i don't undertand that","the watch loss her number six [6] at the scale,i don't know why,i don't know make,maybe is easy to fit,i send to fit,ok"
4,Works great!,"Just the right height for a low light source or background light. Would be too large for most table top sets. The end doesn't quite fit the same way as most of my stands, so the lamp doesn't site 100% securely on it, but it's only a foot or so above the ground, and pretty stable, so not a huge concern. Good value!"
4,indie graceland masterpiece,What the other guy said is a good start. This is a beautiful piece of workand a lovely ep. Slow Day For The Cleaner is a highlight in addition tothe above-mentioned Eureka IV. Combined with the majesty of FoundersDay Parade you've got a trifecta of classics a la the triple-threat ofTake Care/Blue Moon/Nighttime on Big Star's Sister Lovers/Third. Just greatsongwriting delivered in a highly original way. A must-have for indie &rock lovers the world over!
3,Dated But Decent,"There is no question this album is dated in regards to today's hard music scene, but there are a few enjoyable tracks on it. I think the comparison to Helmet from another reviewer is an accurate one. The songs are heavy and riff-laden, and the vocals tend towards a more punk style. The album is still listenable, but you'd be crazy to pay full price for it."
2,Doesnt Exactly Fit,"In order for the mounting plate to fit, you must cut out a section of the side to fit around the power steering resevoir mounting bolt. So its not a quick install."
2,"Sadly, a let-down","I think it was really hard to get over the cheesiness to get to the 'meat' of this book. When I finally got to the 'dealing' part of the book, her ways of handling the situations/people were fairly good but getting there was the painful part. Not to mention the thirty something types of toxic people was more than overkill and a bit difficult to navigate concisely. It read more like a series of case studies and theories.A friend recommended it to me very highly so I think I had much higher expectations. There are other books on this subject matter I would easily recommend over this one.I have read bits of ""Toxic Men"" and think it was better written."
1,UN-ENLIGHTNING READ,"THIS BOOK READ LIKE A CHILD HAD WRITTEN IT. IT WAS OVERLY SIMPLISTIC AND SOUNDED SO CHILDISH IN ITS SOLUTIONS, I'M WONDERING IF THE AUTHOR IS A PRETEEN.ON THE OTHER HAND, THE BOOK ""IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING"" OFFERED REVELATIONS IN IDENTIFYING AGRESSIVE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE WHO MANIPULATE YOU IN A GREAT VARIETY OF WAYS.IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO IDENTIFY AND EFFECTIVELY DEAL WITH A MANIPULATOR IN YOUR LIFE, READ ""IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING""."
1,She would know,"I had the misfortune of taking a seminar taught by this woman, and she is herself toxic. It was presented in the guise of helping the attendees, but was actually a commercial for her services. The people I know who worked with her one on one were not impressed, and felt it was a waste of money. Furthermore, she was rude, self-absorbed, insecure about her weight gains of late, and gave little new information that was helpful. She is not the guru she proclaims! Don't buy this book!"
4,"Easy to Read, helps you categorize toxic ones in your life","I found this book helpful. I never realized how many different kinds of toxic people there are and how even I can be toxic in several categories. This book has helped me learn how to confront difficult people in my life, and when the situation calls for it, unplug completely as no one is worth losing my self image over.Dr. Glass uses real life stories from patients to encourage readers that there is hope to recover from the effects toxic people have on us. It's easy to read and see people you know in each of her descriptions of the toxic individuals. Now I am seeing how I too can be toxic and am working towards eliminating patterns that keep me around negative people."
4,Hysterical!!,"I bought this book because I work with an ""angry pugilist"" (as denoted by Dr. Glass). I found this book a very easy read, it was very amusing, so it kept my interest, unlike some of the other really dry ones. She identifies a bunch of different types of ""toxic"" people like ""bitchy bossy bullies"", ""wishy washy wimp"" ""the mental case"", and so many more. She gives explicit detailed desciptives of these people, then she gives examples of their behavior, and then she goes into techniques to deal with them. Although some of the come backs she uses are definitely brash, and I probably wouldn't say half of them, they are still REALLY funny, and as I read out loud at work, some of us were in tears laughing so hard. There are a few things I did learn from the book about myself actually, and if I can rethink the way I am, I may have better success dealing with miserable people."
3,"Good advice for healing, bad advice for dealing with others.","The best and worst of pop psychology from trendy Hollywood PhDs. This book has great advice on how to understand others' bad behavior and how to heal from it... but you'll want to read with a black pen in hand instead of a hi-liter. That way you can strike out the pedantic lists, the patronizing tone, the Hollywood name-dropping, and the dark humor, mostly in the form of horrible advice on what to say to the toxic person! The remaining 75% of the book is worth reading. I wish I knew of a book which covers the topic better."
2,Toxic People: 10 Ways of Dealing With People Who Make Your Life Miserable,"No different than any self help book written from the 80's. Human flaws and quirks are just a part of life, and shouldn't be viewed as a constant drama. I interpreted the book as one that perpetuates whining and viewing one's self as a victim. Let me save readers their money: There are no victims, only volunteers. People will treat you the way you let them treat you. If you don't like something, say so and remove yourself from the situation, and if it makes someone mad, they'll just have to get glad at their own pace. Take care of yourself, and everything around you will fall into place.I gave it a 2 because there were no misspelled words."
1,Pop Psychology At Its Worst,"Are there really that many toxic people in life? I doubt it. But by sterotyping difficult people who are under stress, unhappy with their lifes, or simply are different from each of us, the author essentially mistreated normally fine people by calling them ""toxic people."" There're always sick people in our society, but they are not the same as what the author would like to see. What about learning to forget and forgive??? The author seems to promote a negative approach to learn how to deal with life! Very discouraging and sad. Not a book I would read again."
1,naive and hostile,"Some of the author's ideas and recommendations appeared quite hostile and lacking in civility. There was too much emphasis on how others affect us and not enough on the resiliency and strength of the human being. The book has its purpose and wisdom; however, it should not be blindly followed. Good judgment is needed in filtering through the author's suggestions. I can see how certain situations would escalate and possibly become dangerous based on following her recommendations."
2,Yeah... almost... but no,Acquired the book and managed to get through everything in less than an afternoon. What does that mean? It skirts the surface of things but doesn't quite help to identify and mitigate toxics. The examples and anecdotes are numerous yet don't quite convice.
2,So so,"In many sections of the book, the author recommends putting out ""fire"" by using gasoline! In other words, she proposes that dealing with ""toxic"" people requires confronting such people... in my opinion. this is the easiest and least intelligent way to solve human relationship problems. The book Crucial Confrontations by Kerry Patterson et alli provides a more insightful approach to the above problems. Another book option is Standing in the Fire by Larry Dressler. Anyway, many hints outlined throughout the Glass' book might be somewhat useful."
2,Not worth the money,"The author gives examples that are to specific and, thus, not applicable to the general population. Also, the examples are formulated as little stories.....boring.....better to have step by step procedures. I was looking for something to help me in a work related situation and the book was totaly unhelpful."
3,Good at finding your problem people but not much else,"Dr Glass does a fine job with listing the types of toxic people you will encounter. It will be fun to say, ""Oh so and so is this one, and he is this she is that ect."" However there are NOT ten ways to deal with the toxic people. How to cope with the bad people is a glaring weakness of the book. Except for questioning people's stupid positions, there will be no new information on how to cope with toxic people. Do note this book does have a socialist feminist twist to it, but it is tolerable."
5,A lot of fun,"This book is a lot of fun (I, too, laughed out loud and that rarely happens to me when I read). I liked the story's structure: the main plot is every overlooked employee's fantasy about a bloodless coup and the colorful ""snapshots"" that are interspersed throughout give you an understanding of the main character's personal and inner life. Overall, terrific!"
3,Light read,"Although the book was a little slow at times, it had a very interesting outcome and was an enjoyable read. The only thing that I can critique was that the outcome of the ""plan"" was VERY predictable. Otherwise, a fun read!"
2,"Quick, Fun, Predictable","This book moved very quickly as a result of the 3 page chapters. This one had a lot of potential- the lack of any character development left me bored by the end, though. The writing was as shallow as many of the characters. What started out as fun and highly engaging ended up predictable and unmemorable."
3,Quick and witty but falls short,"I had heard that this book compared to ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" which I'd read and loved early last year. However, I found that although ""Fashionistas"" was witty and a quick read, the main character was extremely dull, flat and unrelatable; she sparked absolutely no emotion in me while I was reading the book.If you like books like this, stick with ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" ""The Nanny Diaries,"" and ""Citizen Girl."""
2,fashionista,I didn't like this book. I read through half of it and couldn't finish it. It was to boring. The only reason I continued was because I was hoping it would get better.
2,Not great,"I think the lack of character development is a major problem with this book. You don't end up caring about anyone, not even Vig. The plot is rather asinine, and I ended up skimming through just to see how it ended."
1,"Not worth reading - read ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and ""Everyone Worth Knowing"" by Laura Weisberger instead....","My mistake might be in reading this right after reading ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and ""Everyone Worth Knowing"" (both written by Laura Weisberger) back to back. Now about halfway through the book, I feel obligated to finish it even though I really don't like it. The main character, Vig Morgan, is hardly likeable - and that's probably because so little is offered about her by the author. The book has too many chapters, some of which are only 3-5 pages and describe a particular character, situation or day. I wouldn't recommend this book. If you haven't already read Weisberger's novels, RUN to your nearest book store or library and get them!"
1,Not worth the time,"I really didn't like this book at all. I am a big fan of ""chick lit"" and this was just lacking. The main character is likable, however, it never goes anywhere. There is a plot to overthrow the evil boss, but... even that is not that interesting. There is a romance, but it is not developed. There is a weird, needy friend, but that is not developed. I thought this was a waste of time and i am very glad that i only rented it from the library and did not spend money on it. I also did not think it was a quick read; it was almost painful."
4,"A nice, quick read","I really liked this book. I enjoyed the disjointed feel of the chapters and character development. I thought Alex was hillarious. I haven't really goten into the whole ""chick lit"" scene, but this I believe I will read more after this!I do find it a little funny though that a book about copy editors would misspell a literary reference so easy to check as Pride and Prejudice. Elizabeth Bennet's name has one ""t"", not two. I know that is being picky, but I found it funny."
1,What characters? What plot?,"Of all the ""chick lit"" books I have read, this was the only that I did not want to read quickly or completely. The fact that there was no character development is the only thing that spurred me to continue-I kept hoping the author would let me know the main character at some time. If this book was published by Red Dress Ink, I may as well take a few months and write some of my own dribble to be sent into Red Dress so that I can make some quick cash like Lynn Messina did."
1,Baaad!,"I usually enjoy chick lit books, although I know they aren't great literature, but I couldn't finish this piece of drivel. It's badly written, and the situations and characters presented are very unbelievable. Don't bother with this one!"
3,Wait for it to come on sale,"This read was ""ok"". I don't know why I was expecting a little bit more from this book, but I wasn't that impressed with it."
4,A little different,"Fun and a well worth the read. As a Brit, I've read a lot of the British ""chick book"" writers, and have been reluctant to try any of the US writers. However Lynn Messina is good. I hope her next book comes out soon."
5,Amazing Work,"I was not especially a country music fan when I heard Marty Stuart on the Johnny Cash memorial concert a couple of months ago. I was intrigued by his performance though, and began scouting around Amazon to hear what else he'd done. WOW! This CD is one of the most amazing I've ever heard! Great musicianship, great guest stars, super songs and an interesting storyline make this a way-overlooked gem. GO FOR IT!"
5,beautiful music that's awe-inspiring,"I have traveled all over, met many world leaders and am blessed with a very fulfilling career and beautiful family. Yet I didn't realize how incomplete my life was until I heard this album for the first time. With the exception of watching F/A 18s take off and land on the flight deck of an aircraft carrier, nothing else brings such a lump of joy and awe to my throat as listening to The Pilgrim. If I could be buried with the song ""The Greatest Love of all Time"" piped into my coffin, I would truly be in heaven."
3,Not that great,"I know a lot of people (along with CCM Magazine) love this cd, but I just don't get it. To me, it's very average. Maybe it's the lyrics that are causing so much excitement. But to me, it's not even in the top three best JOC cds.I'm glad for everyone who loves it. JOC are a great group. But I was hoping for something better."
3,"Different, not great, but worthy enough","Jars' latest album, as all their other albums, pales in comparison to their self titled album. Work is a sweet song, really catchy and fun, with great lines like ""I have no fear of drowning; it's the breathing that's taking all this work."" The rest of the album just doesn't cut it. They lack really powerful substance in their lyrics. Good Monsters, sounds a little bit like something from The Click Five and Mirrors and Smoke sounds like Johnny Cash. Oh My God is a good song. This isn't a great offering by Jars, but good enough. The are no songs on this album as good as the Valley Song or Jealous Kind."
5,INCREDIBLE,"Wow!! Jars of Clay has done it again. Coming out with another amazing album that will top off the charts. There unique sound and amazing lyrics show they have a heart for God. Once you listen to this one time through, you will find yourself continually hitting the repeat button to listen to the songs over and over. Trust me, if you buy this cd, you will not regret spending some money."
5,Awesome Cd,I love this cd that Jars of Clay put out. Its has great messages within the songs themselves. I enjoy listening to it. It is a great ad to any cd collection!
4,Good Monsters- Great Album!,"I have been a Jars of Clay fan for a long time and I continue to be impressed at their innovation and commitment to making great music. I think the sign of a good Christian rock band is that you would listen to them whether they were a Christian band or not, and this is definitely the case with Jars. This album starts out hard-hitting with ""Work"" and their single ""Dead Man,"" but also shows their expertise in melodic ballads as well. Overall, Eleventh Hour remains my favorite album, but this is definitely near the top of my list and I will be there to see them in concert in a few weeks in Colorado!"
5,Jars of Clay ROCKS!!!!,"Jars of Clay is seriously the best of their genre! They write some of the most well crafted and emotional songs of our time. Every album sounds different and inspirational. Good Monsters is more up beat and fun than previous work. They would have to be my favorite Christian Rock group ever. Everyone should own this album and it would come to no disappointment to their fans of their earlier albums. One of my fav songs would have to be WORK, their video was really cool for it too. Everone should check it out on Launch!"
5,Amazing,"Okay, so I thought that they couldn't top many of their albums like Eleventh Hour and Redemption Songs, but I was completely wrong! This album has blown my expectations out of the water as each song gets me to say, ""Wow this is a great album!"" It brings back some of the rockish sound they've had before, but it really is still their own harmonic based style. They've sculpted some great music in this album and I ask that if you enjoy great and uplifting music, do your musical taste a favor and buy this stunning album!"
5,Incredible Music,"Since discovering my faith more and more as time has gone by, I somehow came across the Jars of Clay website and am I glad I did. This is one incredible CD. The music is pop/rock which will not disappoint you if that is your style of music.I've listened to this CD more times in the few short weeks I've owned it than any other CD I've ever had. All the songs are great in my opinion but my favorite has to be All My Tears. It such a truthful song about what waits for us on the other side and that there's nothing to fear.If you're looking for a stocking stuffer for that special Christian, this CD will not disappoint.God Bless!"
5,Their Best Yet,I am a huge Jars fan and find this to be their best cd yet. The songs are well written and very thought provoking. Hoping to see them on their Spring 2007 tour.
5,Cool Defined,"Literally stumbled upon this cd and it is my first real Jars of Clay experience. It is very, very cool.I have heard their music on radio and as soundtracks to movies or tv features. I have always liked their band name and I have heard they are great but I havent personally ventured or cared enough to find out more about them or their music. Until now.Their music is very simple and stylized, a different kind of rock. The songs on this cd are very retro and I absolutely love that quality about them. They are also strongly reminiscent of the Beatles and sometimes Oasis, with a dash of Hanson, maybe more like at the intersection of all these bands, you'll find Jars of Clay.There is nothing slick about this cd. It's got great songs, great acoustics and is very easy to listen to, kind of like sleeping on a soft, soothing and yet undeniably metallic pillow. Enjoy!"
4,"If You Like Cake, You'll Love This Album","This band is channeling CAKE and some funky jazz stuff together in a loose fitting album. Some of the recordings are a bit 'demo' in their quality, but they certainly are fun even if the quality is rough at times."
5,"Unique, refreshingly different","I love this Group and this is their best album. It is really hard to compare Havalina to anyone else. They just have their own sound. As I understand it, these guys started out as street performers. This title has retained some of that sound. They are always trying for something new in each song, and whatever they do is always fun."
2,What the heck?,I can't believe my eyes at all of the good reviews people are giving this movie. I went and saw this movie in theaters with my uncle and we both wanted to leave about the middle of the movie.IT WAS SO BORING!!! the only people who might actually like are kids under the age of seven. Don't waste your money on buying this or even renting it.
2,Should have rent this one!!1,"Good family movie, but not worthy of my Blue ray collection.BTW Ben Stiller Rocks!!"
3,Eye candy and frantic action for the children but little else.,The movie was well produced. Good cinematography. Eye popping special effects. Not much else. The story never comes together. Just alot of frantic running around over and over again with no real purpose other that to show more of the same special affects. Some funny moments but few. Some serious moments but few. I would have rated this film lower but I do think children would like it.
2,Ben Stiller ruins every movie.,"Night at the Museum probably would've been a lot more enjoyable if it wasn't for Ben Stiller and his lame acting. This film was a box-office smash but that doesn't mean the movie is good. It just means people like to watch silly garbage. The special effects is why I give this movie two stars, everything else is pretty boring. Of course, you have Robin Williams over-acting again, he hasn't done a flawless performance since, One Hour Photo. This movie is designed for children so I recommend this movie to them. Ben Stiller needs to take an acting class and he's not funny either. Snooze...."
2,just ok,"like almost everything Ben Stiller does whom I find vastly overrated this film never packs much laughs and just is kinda there on a whole. the history lesson element is alright in places,but you are also stuck with a whole lot of story and no real story line making any sense. I watched this film recently and just kinda thought it was there. could have been more to it. it tried a whole lot more than it needed. way too much happening all at once."
2,A Snoozer at the Museum,"""Night at the Museum"" was touted as a ""fun way for the young 'uns to learn history!"" Owen Wilson makes an appearance as a cowboy; Robin Williams has a tasteless role as Theodore Roosevelt,who's romancing Pocahontas(!) Ben Stiller stars as a museum guard and divorced father trying to get his son's approval,as well as impress the beautiful Carla Gugino. ""Night at the Museum"" also stretches credibility with Dick Van Dyke and Mickey Rooney as villainous museum guards.""Night at the Museum"" is a confused melange. A dinosaur skeleton comes alive,as does a Roman legion. There's a troublesome monkey. Somehow,an Egyptian tablet can save the day (take one,call me in the morning!) It's the History Channel on LSD. Throw in Teddy Roosevelt, a Pharaoh,cowboys and Roman soldiers,and you'll be as confused as Ben Stiller's character.""Night at the Museum"" lacks suspense... and humor. It's dreadfully dull. If you spend a night at the museum,you'll fall asleep."
5,Great movie and very nice Blu-Ray disc!,"Another very good Blu-Ray disc from FOX.A very nice HD picture a great surround sound that gives you're Home Theater system a workout.And a great movie.I think Night at The Museum is a very fun movie.The only thing the Blu-Ray version is lacking in is a boat load of special features,but that does not bother me,as I usely watch special features once and never watch them again.Well anyways another fine disc from FOX.I do hope FOX will be releasing some more Blu-Ray tittles? I was very disapointed when I read the news that just about all of the tittles that FOX had schedule for Blu-Ray got yanked.Was looking forward to having great movies like The FLY(1986) in High Def."
2,Why people selling USED dvds as NEW dvds?,"I bought this dvd that I thought was brand new but it was a rental, it was sold as BRAND NEW. Why is this allowed on Amazon? Who can I talk to about this?"
3,ok,Thc first DVD was scratched and couldnt watch notified seller they sent me another one and it works good. would order from seller again.
4,night at the museum,"it is a funny movie to watch, not the best perhaps, but really entertaining. The second one is funnier to my taste though"
3,Video stopped playing,Movie was veryinteresting and good. But the movie stopped playing near the end. We didnt get to see the ending of the movie. I have to assume everything got resolved at the museum.
2,Problematic viewing of Night at the Museum,"Used Amazon's streaming service for the first time with Night at the Museum. The player was extremely difficult to operate correctly. I was trying to mirror it to the plasma and the format would not mirror correctly. After about 15 minutes of a combination of plugging and unplugging HDMI, restarting the player and adjusting the player, it worked. It will be a long time before I try that again. Also, you only have 24 hours to finish the movie, that could be a problem for some. Macbook Pro, Pannisonic plasma."
4,watch more than once.....,"I think this is a funny movie. It is one of those movies you need to watch a second and third time to ""see"" everything....Love the ""fetch"" scenes with T-Rex!!! Would recommend..."
4,Nighit at the Museum,"Geat comedy that only Ben Stiller could do. Mickey Rooney and Robin Williams don't hurt it eather! ;-) I do wish that the SELLER hadn't mislead about the version on the movie. TITLE headline was WIDESCREEN...later in the test it mentions Full Screen. No satisfaction from the dealer, or from Yahoo. BEWARE"
3,pretty good film,"Most of Ben Stiller's work is plain horrible!Meet the Fockers (Widescreen Edition)is so badI wouldn't bother reviewing it!Dick van Dyke as a villain has a strange feel to it:there are several older actors in the picture who might have handled the lead role better were they younger.There is actually some socially redeeming worth to this filmcompared to the trash Stiller has been making.As the Stiller family plays bit parts in some of these films ( hismother was the employment lady), you would think he would try harder.I think Ben Stiller is a lot like Jerry Lewis in thathe has begun to believe he is funnywhen he isn't."
3,Great for kids and quite dull for adults,"For Kids:I got this DVD for my 6 year old kid. He was quite exicted watching through out the movie. It was pleasure watching a movie with whole family with out any blood or nudity. Good entertainment for kids.Four stars kid movie.For Adults: Idea of the movie is great. Many scenes in the movie are weak. Scenes have two much fuss, to convinice the kids. Neither good enough jokes for kids, nor for adults.Two stars adult movieExtras: ""After Film school"" is great. ""Directing 101"" shows the full energy and style of this director. Other are normal.Bottom line: 3 starts."
2,Don't get me wrong!,"Don't get me wrong! I love this movie, but the quality of the recording was terrible! It looks converted from VHS :-("
4,A Fantasy with a moral?,"Ben Stiller is a shiftless no-hoper who has a history of unfulfilled plans, until he takes a job at the Museum where Teddy Roosevelt convinces him that giving up achieves nothing.But finding that you are the night watchman in a museum where all the exhibits come to life every night would be a life changing event for anybody I suspect.Totally unbelievable, yet somehow you can suspend your unbelief long enough to enjoy the story - and celebrate Ben Stiller's discovery that he does have a spine after all.Just good fun mostly."
4,One of the better Ben Stiller movies..,"It went just a little long in a couple of places, but overall a well written and excuted movie. For the record I am usually not a Ben Stiller fan, for some reason much of his humor falls flat with me. However in this movie his comedic timing was spot on. I also rather like the presence of Robin Williams, who I don't usually associate with this type of film. Yet his presence along with screen legends Dick Van Dyke, Bill Cobb and Mickey Rooney helped make the movie a little more believable. I also rather like that this movie is the sort of film you could take almost anyone to see without having to worry about them being offended with an over abundence of out of foul language and crude toilet style humor. Yes there is some but this time the writters managed to get the balance just right, and keep it within the movies context."
4,Funny and lite on the brain!,"Ben Stiller has never been one of my favorites, but he is fine in this film. Just don't think about the logic and go with it. The kids loved it."
3,Don't Believe The Hype,A pleasant movie to watch while you're doing laundry. Great kids film... great adult comedy? Meh.
4,A little corny but funny.,So I thought Robin Williams would be funnier in this film than expected but hey it was more about Ben Stiller so I guess that makes sense. Anyways it is a good comic relief if you are into something a tad bit corny but has somewhat clean humor to it. Nothing terrible. Makes for a good film night.Woodywood Pecker
4,Cute family movie,Watched with entire family before visiting the museum. Very cute. Everyone was looking for the different exhibits and looking to see if they came to life.
4,Night at the museum movie,"Be careful who you order from, Save the receipts and packing information. My movie had several scratches. I've gotten better at thrift store. Used is indeed used!Otherwise, this is wonderful funny movie with an outside story that is human minus the funny part. One of my favorite movies of all time. Can watch it over and over and over againl...hahaha"
3,fun movie,"this is a good movie for the family, althought idk it wasnt quite as good as i expected. it did have funny moments, and is great for kids"
4,Decent movie for everyone's entertainment,This is a good movie for the whole family. It probably won't hold a child 5 and under attention the whole time.
4,Excellent for the whole family & Spectacular HD!,"Night at the Museum is a little slow and boring in the beginning, but the rest of the movie is fantastic. Ben Stiller is comedic without overdoing it, unlike Jim Carrey's style. The storyline captures both adults and children. This blu-ray transfer is phenomenal; the picture quality is crisp and vibrant, and the sound quality is top-notch. You won't do it justice unless you get this in blu-ray. You don't need an action flick to showcase your high definition entertainment center-Night at the Museum really delivers. Having two kids, this movie has a high replay value for me, although I can see myself skipping the first chapter or two..."
3,Jumanji meets Honey I Shrunk the Kids,"Stiller provides his usual schtick (and is in approximately 95% of the movie, so you need to be a fan) but this movie is plotless. Owen Wilson appears in a small role (pun intended)."
2,"Without Owen Wilson, There Would Be One Star","If you choose to rent and watch this, rent a hammer as well. First, smash the DVD of this to oblivion and then whack yourself on your bean several times for being such a knob. Dumbness, lameness, lousy acting mixed with a lousy plot and marginal purpose to OK computer generated action sequences. Whap yourself again if you ever think of this terrible movie again. The good stuff of this movie would make a total of an amusing four minute YouTube video with cowboy Owen Wilson and the Roman general bickering. That is it. Don't make me break out my own hammer... Move on. Bad, bad, bad movie."
3,a good family movie - nothing more..nothing less,"night at the museum will meet all expectations.. it is fun, funny, and friendly... Ben Stiller is always enjoyable.. it is a good movie to rent.. i certainly wouldn't buy it.. then again i am not a family person."
4,Cute family movie,Not much of a deep plot line but still cute and appropriate for the family. May even encourage a history lesson or two. We enjoyed it and will keep it in our library.
2,Pretty Good...,"Being a Ben Stiller fan in the past, I thought this movie was good, but not the best movie I had seen in 2006. Don't get me wrong, the movie was funny, and probably the best comedy I have seen in a long time, but I don't think it is worth seeing over and over. The acting was great and the special effects were outstanding. Ben Stiller, I believe, was absolutely perfect for the leading role.I'm reminding you that this is a review; therefore it is an opinion. With this I am saying that this movie is not as good as most people say, but is still pretty good, not to mention funny.Overall I think this movie deserves 2 stars. If you purchase this movie, don't get your hopes up for it being flat out great, but know this film is pretty darn funny and exciting.So, I hope this review was helpful to you. Thank's for reading!"
1,YOU KNOW YOUR IN TROUBLE WHEN THE FUNNIEST JOKE IS A MONKEY DOING AN R. KELLY IMPERSONATION!,"I am really surprised so many adult people liked this film!,I can see small children liking it?, but I just thought it was a big bore! I am a big fan of Ben Stiller and I have watched many movies with the same theme of ""divorced parents with a child and the wife tells her ex to get his act together or else he can't see the kid anymore""!...whew!! This premise was done a million times better in Mrs. Doubtfire and Liar Liar. You know your in trouble when the funniest joke in the movie is a monkey urinating on someone! The jokes really fall flat in this really stupid and boring movie. Didn't Robin Williams learn from ""Jumanji""!? Look! I am not a harsh critic when it comes to ""dumb dumb"" comedies like this(I kinda like them too!),but this one just isn't funny at all!....it's just corny!"
3,meh... ; 3.5 stars,"Let me first state that I have NOT seen this movie yet; in fact, I don't believe it's even come out yet. I am simply reviewing this based off what I have read and people who got into sneak previews of Night at the Museum... and based off what I've heard, I won't be going to see this movie. I'm a pretty big fan of history, which for me would be the only turn-on for a movie about a down on his luck guy who just happens to land a job at a museum that houses a few secrets, mainly that its exhibits come to life during the wee hours of the night- during his shift, go figure... Slow and repetitive are the two main comments that I've gotten about Night at the Museum, and unless a glorifying review comes along, this is one movie I'll be glad to skip over and just rent when it comes to DVD- maybe."
1,Dumb,"After 45 minutes, not having laughed, I left the theatre to get on with life. This holds little for the adult, unless you've never seen the Three Stooges, read a comic or seen a real comedy."
5,"Great movie, one of Ben Stiller's best","When I saw this movie in the theatres, I knew I had to purchase it so that I could watch it anytime I would like to. This movie also has some of my favorite actors in it which include Dick Van Dyke, Bill Cobbs, and Mickey Rooney playing 3 retiring night watchmen who are showing Ben Stiller's character how to start out being the perfect night watchman. It is also funny watching Ben Stiller's reaction when all the museum statues and artifacts come to life and scare the daylights out of him. And then to see how he reacts when he realizes he is responsible for making sure nothing happens to any of them being under his care."
5,Review of NIght at the Museum purchase,This purchase was handled with dispatch. The product was just as it was advertised. I am satisfied with the purchase and the film.
5,great!,I think this movie is the funniest movie I have seen in a long time. My husband and I saw it at the theater when it came out and liked it then. I have it now on my Ipod and watch is at least twice a week. This movie is so funny and I laugh every time I watch it.
2,lost in translation,"This movie builds well and goes nowhere. The laughs, few and far between, are mostly slapstick. There are no convincing performances. I was never involved in this movie, and it didn't seem like the filmakers cared if I was or not. The main character's (Larry's) romantic interest was never developed, the sub-plot with his son was more tedious than involving, and the ending was just plain obtuse. He spends the whole night rounding up the three ex-guards who are ripping off the museum, and then come morning, when his boss asks him for an explanation of the museum's condition, he says nothing about his prisoners! They are entirely forgotten! But his boss sees a bunch of new patrons in the hall and decides to give Larry his job back, even without a direct correllation between Larry and the patrons! Robin Williams is ill-used and his talent wasted in this movie. Sorry, but true."
4,Sweet family movie,"First things first: I am not a fan of Ben Stiller.Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara ... yes. Their hellspawn child.. no!However, this role was the one this child-like actor was born to play. As I was watching this film it occurred to me that the reason why I disliked most of Ben Stiller's movies was because they were juvenile delinquencies supposedly aimed at an older audience. With this one, Ben throws his hands up in the air and admits, ""OK, I give up! It's for kids!! So Sue me!""Stiller, Owen Wilson, Robin Williams, Patrick Gallagher and even the under-appreciated Steve Coogan (who will make you laugh out loud more than once with his Monty Python-esque performance) join forces with the classic Dick Van Dyke (!) and Mickey Rooney (!!) to make this a highly addictive rollicking good fun family fantasy classic.Lock the doors, make sure the kids are comfortable and pass the popcorn! You will love this."
4,my husband & I loved it!,"My hubby & I loved it, already watched it twice now. One of these days I will have my grandaughter over and put it on for her, lol.Great cast of characters and quite funny. Amazing how they actually made it (in the extras part). This is for sure a keeper."
4,More plot than expected,The way this movie was marketed made me think there was not going to be much of a plot to this movie- but there is plenty. A much better movie than I ever expected it to be. This is not major film making but a very entertaining movie.
4,Night at the Museum,"I actually saw part 2 first before seeing part 1. And I must say Part 1 is way better and is the best of the two. It's very funny, Robin Williams has more time in the movie and the movie is fun to watch."
4,My five year old loves it.,"Ok, so may be it isn't Ebert and Roper material. It seems to entertain my youngster."
4,Just the right blend of slapstick and great writing,A movie that I'm willing to watch repeatedly with my daughter. Plenty of catchy writing and slapstick fun. With a bit of sweetness and a message worth discussing at the end with your kids. Definitely a Friday nite family fun movie.
3,Great movie but watch what version you get,"The movie is great! The kids enjoyed it and the parents cracked up too.Watch out what version you get though. I was very, very disappointed to find that the widescreen version does not have any behind the scenes features. There are two commentaries (director's commentary and writer's commentary) and that's it.I was really surprised that with a movie as cool as this one they didn't have any behind the scenes but now I found out that in order to get that you have to buy the ""special edition"" 2 disc set.So if I ever see the 2 disc set it might get 5 stars, but this single disc with no good special features gets only 3 from me."
3,aside from some plot holes overall great family film,"Great family film, lots of laughs and the typical happy ending."
4,Night at the Museum.,I loved Robin Williams in this movie. The special effects were top notch. Loved the way the characters were developed.
4,An OK Night at the Movies,"The movie gets to the action fairly quickly. It's funny how they give life to objects and give personality to people from the past that have come to life in the museum. It's interesting to see Larry try to relate to the museum's inhabitants. I found the plot to be a bit thin and the ending is almost the same as Shrek 1, dance party? Wierd. Overall, a fun movie for all."
2,freddy Krueger is funnier than ben stiller,"seriously, ben stiller should retire from comedy because i definatly believe its not for him, the only reason people think his movies were funny or even successful is because everything else in his movies were funny except for him, as in he had so much help in his movies to make him a star.His personality is definatly not funny at all, he is nothing like other amazing comedians like robin williams(which was one of few good things in this movie),eddie murphey or even action stars like jackie chan who arn't even comedians but still do have a good sense of humor without having to try too hard.ben is a very bad comedian but he's not the worst, that would have to be a tie between tom green and that guy from saturday night live (forgot his name, maybe its a good thing too)so ben stiller, maybe you should be in a horror movie or something because i found ""a nightmare on elm street"" so much funnier than any of your movies."
4,"sweet, fun, unpretencious movie","that guarantees a fun night at the theatre.there is enough humor, warm family and love stories, cool effects, interesting twists.all in all, fun night out for kids et al."
3,Creepy,The story line was a little slow and the powerhouse characters weren't used to thier potential.
2,I can't believe I bought the two-pack,"If you are into silly, then this might be OK, but I thought that, based on the cast, it would address a broader--read adult+child--audience. This movie helps me to appreciate the skills of Disney and Pixar. What was I thinking when I bought BOTH the first and sequel? Not a good deal unless you are absolutely sure you will like this genre."
4,Learning From History,"This is a fantastic movie.A deadbeat dad, played by Ben Stiller who cannot keep a job saves himself and the museum by learning the importance of history.He is taught by Teddy Roosevelt, played by Robin Williams, that history is made not by great people, but by ordinary people who do great things.This movie is helped by chanters played by great actors such as Robin Williams, Mizuo Peck, who plays Sacajawea, as well as the villains played, by veteran actors Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney and Bill Cobbs.I recommend this movie to historians, as well as those who are only a little curious about history.This movie was great."
4,Funny!,"This movie was funny. Kept adults and teens interested too. Good cast! A little rude, but overall good."
4,OK FOR KIDS,"THIS FILM HAS GREAT FEATURES EXCEPT THAT IF YOUR CHILD UNDERSTANDS ""UNDERLYING"" COMMENTS AND ACTIONS, THIS MAY NOT BE THE BEST. MY 4 YEAR OLD DOESN'T UNDERSTAND YET, SO IT IS OK."
5,A Family-Oriented Fun Movie.,The plot is simple and even silly. But the movie soon grabs your attention and moves right alone. Definitely worth watching a few times.
2,not too funny really,"The movie had a couple of funny parts but that's about all. The ending seem to drag on, I got the impression the writers/director didn't know how to finish the film. I'd save my money & rent it, not worth the dough."
2,Where are the special features?,"For the extra price and supposed extra storage space on these next generation DVD's - where's the special features? This Blu-ray was basically movie only while the standard 2-disc DVD gets all the special features. If the studio is trying to get people to adopt the next generation of DVD's, this is a terrible way of doing it."
2,you've got to be kidding me,"the average for this movie is 4 out of 5 stars....for what?!!! for another boring movie with a terrible script....ahhhh, this is my first review of a movie and i'm compelled to relay my thoughts because of this stinker...i used to like ben stiller and robin williams until once again they find themselves in movies that really blow...the story has been used a 100 times and the effects- a dino, monkey and a talking rock...come on!!!! another movie of the same caliber, spiderman 3...guess what, he bites."
2,Good concept,"The idea of a museum coming to life is awesome. History, love, Science, art ect wow. This movie destroys itself as it progresses. They drag you into the concept of it being real only to destroy this thought or overlining premiss of the whole moive by the line from Willims ""Pres. Roosevelt"" when he states oh I am only a wax figure made in ? what can you expect out of me I never did any of those things.(cannal,hunting, ect) What's the piont.I bought it because the previews were funny. Save your money and just watch the previews. The movie is not funny the lines are weak but the grafics are good . The special edition also stunk. The whole thing was nothing but watch our movei not this is how we did this and why we chose him ect. a real let down in more then the pocket. );"
3,Finally picks up...,"Honestly, I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. From the previews, it looked like a good mix between comedy and family-style thriller, with a little bit of history mixed in. The first half of the movie drags in some places, and the humor is funny only when Ben Stiller isn't allowed to go into one of his ""take-the-joke-and-beat-it-to-death-for-five-minutes"" type moments. If you've seen this or other movies, you'll know what I mean.Other than that, the end really picked up, providing the comedy, action, and family ""feel-good"" ""life lesson"" moments that should have been present the whole time.Anyone with kids: take them, they'll love it, and they might learn something.Anyone without kids: it's worth seeing, but just be prepared to be a little less entertained until later in the movie.PS- You'll love the monkey. He's a riot!"
4,Another Great Family Movie,"I would recommend this movie for anyone who has a family. It is an enjoyable movie that incorporates history in a great way. Although I have not seen the sequel, I cannot wait to do especially if it is anything like the first."
4,A Night at the Museum,"I am not generally a Ben Stiller fan, but I have to admit he was pretty good in this movie. I love the special effects that were in this movie. I think this movie has a great benefit to share with children of some of the historic events that took place in the past. This movie also shows the importance of a relationship with sons and fathers. This movie would make a good gift."
3,Museums,This movie invites the audience to takes a child's look of wonder in the Museum of natural history as the exhibits really come to life. It is fun for the whole family.
4,Movie great. Special Features? Well. . . .,"This set has two discs. One disc has the movie which is wonderful and great etc. However, we really enjoy seeing how movies are made. We were very disappointed that only 1/3 of the special features were able to load. Amazon graciously sent me another copy, but it still did the same thing. Most of the episodes on disc two would freeze up my DVD player while some loaded just fine. Is anyone out there having the same problem? It's a possibility that it is my DVD player, although it is fairly new. Upon further research into this, I will come back and revise my review."
5,"Fantastic family film,",I saw this last night on christmas eve with the family we loved it though my dad wasen't to big on it he still enoyed being with the family. i thought the best scenes were with mr. van dyke and mickey rooney (i don't know who bill cobbs) ben stiller did a great job in this movie he's expressions were realistic and the scenes with him and jediah the cowboy (played by owen wilson) were great. this movie also has hardley any languange and no trace of sexuality or rotten humor (which is quit rare these days) great movie for the family.
4,good family fun,I was pleased with this movie. It had cool special effects and a nice story. It was also good to see Dick Van Dyke. I would recommend this to anyone who likes family films.
5,kids,They love it and watch it all the time..I buy dvds all the time and this 1 is the best so far..funny movie 4 all ages..thank u.
4,Great Movie,This was a cute story and I loved the special effects. Robin Williams is a scream. My son loves this movie and we've watched it at least 10 times by now!
3,Good - for the kids,"Enjoyable romp - mostly for the kids, good special effects.The directors cut is worth a listen, though the DVD is not a keeper."
1,"Crap, pure crap!!!","I mistakenly bought this cd, thinking it was one of the compilations that had such esteemed artists as Dwight Yoakam, Pam Tillis, Henry Rollins, Kenny Chesney, James Hetfield, etc.Wrong. What I got was a cheesy tribute album by ""The International Country All-Stars"". If you want a greatest hits collection, buy one that is performed by the man, Waylon Jennings, rather than a cheap knock-off.Anyone want my copy? I'll never listen to it again."
5,Flawless productions of livey tunes for kids 3 to 6.,"Ideal for children ages 3 to 6, Where Is Thumbkin?: More Action Songs For Every Month offers twenty-four lively and popular songs divided up into two selections for each month of the year. These are well known tunes that will help young listeners to sing and develop language patterns, concepts and verbal skills.

1,Never received product.,I never received product. I was relying on the product for a project. I tried to contact the seller several times and never received an answer. I want to put 0 stars but the computer will not let me!!
3,hot air,"It took a good hour to get this thing going - holding in the 'pilot' button got real old after the first minute... and out went the flame.Then a minute longer, and out again.Eventually, having held in the button until my thumbs turned blue, it stayed on long enough for me to stretch my hands out. pffffffft.and over... and over...If it stays lit long enough this unit will work nicely to warm an uninsulated 2 car garage with 13' ceilings in under an hour.Of course, you'll have crippled hands and be almost deaf from the fan & roar of the flame - but heck!Good value, a little on the noisy side, but once you break the thermocouple in, it's alright."
4,need a tan?,"If you need heat in your garage during the winter months little noisy, I often equate this to starting a jet engine, but the heat is what I bought it for."
1,JUNK,"I ordered one of these a year ago. When It came, It had an inoperative thermocoupler. I sent it back for a replacement. The replacement came and had the same issue. To use this heater I have to clamp the the""primer"" button down which eliminates the only safety feature designed into it. Sometimes the heater won't ignite regardless of fuel flow. Do not buy this piece of JUNK!"
2,Projects but no great ideas,"I was somewhat disappointed in this book in that it was really geared towards girls' rooms. Some of the ideas were helpful. But in looking back, I don't think that I should have bought this book. The photographs were very limited as well. I was looking for ideas and I didn't find them here."
2,Outdated & no modern touches,"Although released in 2002, this book is very traditional and follows very traditional nursery set-ups. I would have liked to see an example of a more modern room."
4,Decent Book,"This book gave us some good ideas about how to decorate our nursery. It had great explanations about crib types, sizes and more. I wish the pages were bigger. Other than that its a good book."
2,Don't leave it in the sun...,"...unfortunately, this is a WINDSHIELD mount, so leaving it in the sun is unavoidable. Anyways, after the first summer using this mount, it has warped itself out of shape too much to hold the GPS in place. Also, the suction cups are weak and the mount falls off the windshield about once a month."
5,great seller,I purchased this for my husband for Christmas early in December. I was told it would arrive in 7-10 days. It did not arrive so I contacted the seller. He had shipped it out but it was lost in the mail. He immediately sent me another one out overnight to me at no extra cost so I would have it by Christmas. I highly recommend this seller!!!!
5,Actually Works..,I bought the mounting bracket to use while geocaching. It holds my Explorist 500 securley and where I can see it. Great while using turn by turn map programs. Good product.
3,It's a children's book,I'm adding this book to our Scholastic Reading Counts software with a teacher-written quiz. I'll be interested to see how the students rate the story.
4,Detailed account of Takata's life and Reiki practice,This book is primarily a biography of Takata's life. Takata brought Reiki from Japan to Hawaii and taught over twenty Reiki masters before her death
2,Sloppy Final Drafts,"Ok, you're probably thinking all paper is mostly the same. Not really. Some brands have thicker paper than others, and some have smoother paper that make things messy. Let's use Mead's College Paper for an example.For pencil writing, this will do fine. Pencil are harder, and ""grab"" the paper easily, so you control your writing.For pens and markers, this paper is a nightmare. Pens seem to be hard to write with on the Mead college paper. They tend to go off, and lose track, making you have to write slowly so the pen won't go in different directions. Markers are the same.Fountain pens seem to leak through the paper, making things hard to read.This paper may do pretty well with roghdrafts, but for final copies, this paper is a nightmare."
3,Seems like pieces of a bunch of other lessons,"This is a decent DVD and is a nice review of the player's styles, but I wouldn't say I got that much out of it. It seems like it's cut from full length individual lessons, because each player talks about something they have done earlier in the lesson which they haven't. I watched it in full yesterday and played a bit on the banjo with it, I'll probably do that a few more times and then put it away. I think there are better teaching aids out there."
5,Great Reading,This is a great book to read and goes in detail to explain why a lot of so called fact or what one is lead to believe is in fact not true. I would recomend this to anyone who witnesses to others especially to evolutionist as this does a great job in rebutting that theory.
4,A native of St. Croix looks at the List,"As a ""bahn-ya"" Cruzan, I was delighted to read Mr. Martini's description of my island. For the most part, he was pretty well on. It was impossible to find The List in the bookstores here at Christmas. As others have noted, Sint Maarten is NOT one of the USVI, nor are passports needed to travel between Puerto Rico (a US commonwealth) and the Virgin Islands (a US territory). One reader commented on the police officer calling someone an American - that's right - we also call you all yankees or continentals :)"
3,"Predictable, formulaic.","I'd have to say that at first the book was a page turner. Then, after the second death in the book, I had the ""mystery"" figured out and couldn't wait for the plot to unravel (I hate quitting). I found Mr. Martini's knowledge of the Virgin Islands most distracting. First, St. Martin is not a Virgin Island. Second, there was much description of the need for passports to travel to Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Third, one character who was a police officer in St. Croix made an observation about ""Americans"". Does Mr. Martini know nothing about the United States and its territories? By the time I got to the last fifty pages of the book, I was put off by the dramatics and the heroics and the damsel in distress stuff and I felt that I was reading a Sidney Sheldon novel."
2,The List Not Worthy of Its Title,"The premise of a thriller revolved around the greed and egos of writers and money-grabbers trying to make The Bestseller List was intriguing. Martini ruins it by creating predictable outcomes at every turn, including the best friend turned killer, the man with a dark past turned lover, and the intelligent writer turned brains of mush. The hard-working writer claws her way into the publishing world, creates a multi-million dollar best-seller, then turns everything over to a man she hires as a front, jumps into bed with him, suspects he's trying to kill her, then feels great about him after the real killer is caught! And we're supposed to accept all of this! This book cannot possibly make ""The List""."
2,Hyperbolic characters.,"I felt the Madriani novels were 6's to 8's.This gets a 4 because all the characters were exaggerated...very much like a comic book. Martini is also trying his hand with a little humor, and it doesn't work. He would be well advised to stick to his strength-Courtroom drama. Please Martini, if you're going to fool around with character development and dialogue, read more Elmore Leonard."
3,Bypass the middle,"I am a huge Steve Martini fan, so when I bought it, I was hoping for a book similar to Undue Influence. I was enthralled by the first 250 pages, but when Jack and Abby went to St. Croix, I was bored. Martini needed to stay with the primary storyline. Then, when Abby was confronted with the fact of who killed her friends, I was excited to find out what would happen. The last paragraph made the whole book for me."
5,"WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, it was great!",I know it may not have been great literature. But the plot was original and exciting. I am about the slowest reader you will find and i was reading 200 pages a day on vacation. I found it exciting and interesting. It does teach you a little about the process of publishers and reveals a little of the inside world of publishing that I never knew.
3,A summer beach novel,"Don't let an average rating deter you from reading this book. Yes, it's not great literature. It's predictable. The characters are overwritten. It's just a little too pat. And, Mr. Martini writes his female characters from a male point of view. All that said, it's a fun page turner. I class this book as ""mind candy."" It's fun to read; but, you won't remember it tomorrow."
2,"My first ""Martini"" and maybe my last one.","The book was for most of the aspect fantascentific. I belived somethings more amazing,maybe better if shorter."
1,A disappointment from an otherwise brilliant novelist,"As a novelist myself who is a fan of Steve Martini, I was dismayed and let down by The List. He seemed to have dashed it off in a hurry, giving us a cliched formula plot with too predictable, hackneyed scenes and not very interesting characters. Research was also lacking in some areas. Steve: stick to the court room."
2,Stick With Martini's Other Novels,"I'm afraid I don't agree with the other reviewers. This is not the Martini I've come to respect. If you're about to read your first Martini, start with another book."
4,Alex's Awesome Alphabet,"The List, by Steve Martini is a very exciting and thrilling book. It has murders and mysteries, and also goes into a detail on other subjects. For instance, the main idea is that an unknown author writes a book that has the potential to become a best seller. The author, being older, thought it would be better to write the book under a pen name. She tells only her closest friends, but when one of them is murdered she begins to worry. She now has to trust the man that she thinks killed her friend. This book is very good, with an ending to die for; I never would have guessed what had happened. I would suggest this book to many people, because it was a great read."
5,Highly recommended story!,"As another reviewer mentioned, this was also my first book by Steve Martini, and it quickly became one of the most exciting books I've ever read. I went through this book in a matter of days, and keep the book on my home shelf to read again in the future. I have recommended it to friends and they agree that the author is exceptional. I have since gone deeper into his list of bestsellers, and the Paul Madriani series has made me a continuing fan. I read a lot of non-fiction also, especially first-hand WWII accounts, but grab for a work of fiction when I want to be totally emersed in a great story .... ok, maybe an escape, but isn't that why most of us love good fiction? I'm a big fan of Martini for certain, and will continue to spread the word in his favor. Like most readers, I latch on to a good author when he or she crosses my path, and Martini is a keeper! If you haven't tried him yet, The List is a superb way to begin. Enjoy the ride! silverwings442002@yahoo.com"
3,"Interesting, but predictable story line with few surprises.","Steve Martini has authored much better novels in the past. The List had an extremely predictable story line, including the identity of the villain, but I did find it entertaining although not a book I couldn't ""put down"" but was happy to finish and move on to something with more convuluted of a plot that required a bit of thinking with a few surprises and twists.As a note, on page 293, Mr. Martini refers to the group of the U.S. Virgin Islands as including St. Croix, St. John and St. Martin. St. Martin is not part of the U.S. Virgin Islands and is, in fact, half Dutch and half French in its governing body. Mr. Martini should have included St. Thomas as the third of the U.S. Virgin Islands."
3,Martini bites the hand that feeds him.,Martini bites the hand that feeds him as he trashes all aspects of the publishing industry in The List. It almost seems as if he is bitter about the way he was treated in the early part of his writing career. Now that he has vented his spleen he should go back to what he does best. This is a mediocre effort at best
4,Fast read,"Don't expect this to be like Martini's other books, because it really isn't. But it's a fast-paced fun read with well-drawn characters that are interesting. This will be a good beach book for the summer"
4,Alex's Awesome Alphabet,"The List, by Steve Martini is a very exciting and thrilling book. It has murders and mysteries, and also goes into a detail on other subjects. For instance, the main idea is that an unkown author writes a book that has the potential to become a best seller.

She now has to trust the man that she thinks killed her friend. This book is very good, with an ending to die for; I never would have guessed what had happened. I would suggest this book to many people, because it was a great read."
1,Ugh.,"Predictable plot, wooden characters, bad dialogue, and careless research ruin an exciting premise. Besides the author's confusion over geography and passports, there are some really stupid sentences like (and this is an exact quote) ""She gave Morgan an incredulous look like she didn't believe this."" What does Martini think ""incredulous"" means, anyway? Did an editor even look at this mess?"
1,The List?,"I was so disappointed with this Martini book. The villain was obvious from the beginning, the characters not at all defined and the plot just boring. I didn't even get the title. What has happened to Steve Martini?"
2,"Formulaic, TV movie storyline at best","It's too bad that The List isn't a better book because Steve Martini has the gifts for conversation, suspense and pacing. But you can tell he has Grisham-envy as The List reads like a script for a TV Movie of the week and unfortunately has all the cliches to boot."
4,British Military History AD 300-1100,"This book has virtually nothing to do with the 'Arthurian' period, much less literature. It generally focuses on giving a brief overview of British arms, armor, and armies between the later days of the Roman occupation to the eve of the Norman conquest. The text also briefly touches on the Irish, Scots, and Picts. Plates are good as usual, as is the text, but just not enough space."
1,poorly made,I agree with the first reviewer. This is poorly made stuff. There are no manual. All jigs don't have gage nor measurment. Don't even try sharping bowl gouge on it.
3,poor directions/poor customer service,"In short, the directions are aweful and trying to resolve the issues from the directions with PSI customer service was useless and frustrating. If one is going to buy this system, count on learning how to use it without the help of the directions or PSI customer service."
1,Indian Delights Cookbook,I received the book in a timely manner and great condition. However to my dissappointment there was almost 10 blank white pages in the middle of the book and also pages where pictures were missing. I can't tell if the blank pages were missing pictures or recipes. It's been 4 years since I moved out of South and was totally delighted when I purchased his book and am still content on keeping despite the missing pages.
5,Clear and thorough,"The DVD is everything it claims to be. If you diligently follow the instructions you will learn how to create a seascape,even if you are a novice like myself. There is a little of everything: poetry, theory and practice. Absolutely worth the money."
1,A Waste of my Time and Money,"I am sure that Mr Pickering is a wonderful painter, but from this DVD you will never know. While the video portion of the DVD was fine, the volume was all over the place and uncontrollable, Whether on my desk top computer, laptop or on my DVD player. I would not advise anyone to waste their money on this product."
1,Car started having issues when i installed it,"I have an 01 cheverolet Prizm and when i installed this oxygen sensor the car would lose power when cold, unless i put my foot all the ways down. After warming up it was fine. Not happy with my purchase!Update i installed a Denso 234-4205 Oxygen Sensor and it works great. when i took the Bosch one out it was covered in soot due to poor fuel burning."
3,Sometimes,I have used the Bosch sensors before with good luck but this one doesn't work for the Prizm/Corolla. Had to replace with nipondenso brand.
1,Greatly Disappointed,We installed it in my toyota corolla and it made my car run terribly. Almost like the transmission was about to fail. After 2 unsuccessful days of attempting to make changes we eventually uninstalled it and put the old one back in. Then the car ran perfect once again.I would not suggest this product to anyone.
3,"Okay, but...","There's nothing groundbreaking here, but it's pleasant enough. One curiosity: ""Get Ready, Teddy"" gradually drops in pitch throughout the track, as if an old Victrola were winding down. If you've been blessed (or cursed!) with perfect pitch, skip this track, or you'll be tempted (as I was) to fling the disc out the window. I wonder why someone as fastidious in the studio as Daryl Dragon is would allow something like this to be released?"
3,Correction...,"The track that gradually slows down is ""Denny's Such A Flirt"". It's still annoying as all get out, though."
5,"If you work in schools, you MUST get this book!",The first 4 chapters of this book include concise information on all aspects of student behavior in school. The rest of the book includes school based interventions and how to implement them at your location. I am a former special education teacher and current school psychology student--this book is the best resource that I have on my shelf. GET IT!
4,Worth a listen,This little offering is definately worth your buck if you like the noisy side or the softer bits of Starflyer. I for one love the version of Droned.
2,Very misleading sizing,I followed the sizing chart perfectly to select the correct size for my daughter. The size I chose based on the provided chart was so big it was ridiculous. I have returned the items and will not try again with this product as I don't want to keep having to pay for return shipping on exchanges. Buy at your own risk.
4,Great punk!,"This is my favorite plankeye album! I did like common wealth also. But if you liked FAITH NO MORE old punk style then you will enjoy this! Common wealth went a little more radio but yeah the rest of the albums after that were a complete disappointment. So I guess I can see why the fans of the new stuff don't like this album but if you don't like plankeye but you are a fan of old school punk than pick this up. It is awesome. Don't believe me listen to revolution above and get it and jam! Hey for fans of this and commonwealth also pick up the album ""never say dinosaur-petra tribute"" Plankeye does a great version of ""all the king's horses"""
1,Not the band you know and love,"This is terrible, probably the worst album I own. Some of these tracks are okay, but the lyrics are so cheesy, and there are some horrid guitar solos. You can see some songwriting foundations here that the band developed into excellence on later realeases, but this is too raw and awkward sounding for me."
1,Dreadful.,"It's amazing Plankeye turned into such a wonderful band, beginning with ""Commonwealth"" through ""Strange Exchange"". I bought this album because of the band, but quickly dismissed it as a collector's item. It's your typical 3-chord punk stuff that just smells up the radio today. The same old tired riffs, the same beats, the same vocals. It gets really old really quick. Skip this one and get ""Commonwealth""..then move from there."
3,Great Recording - But No Libretto,"If I wanted the music only, I would have bought the download here or on iTunes. I buy hard-copies so that I get the libretto with English translation. But no libretto book came with this set of CDs. Instead, the packaging refers you to a website to download pdfs. That would be somewhat acceptable, but the website is broken. So far, I have had no luck finding anyone at SONY BMG Masterworks who is willing to take responsibility. Annoying."
3,Something missing,"There is a part at the end of the 2nd CD just before the aria ""Trema, trema scellerato"" that is missing.Starts at DONNA ANNA, DONNA ELVIRA, DON OTTAVIO e MASETTO: Siam qui noi per tua difesa! and ends at DON GIOVANNI a Donn'Anna: Ah, credete...besides that, the record is superb and I shall highlight Tereza Berganza's Zerlina."
4,"Nice, but","This heater is very nice. Puts out lots of heat fast. The only thing I dislike is that you can not put it on a thermostat, so it would shut off and come back on by it's self."
1,Ick,"I bought this when my son was older (like one year old), none of the information was relevant because we were past all the stages covered in the book. I also thought the writing was pretty blah. This book went to Goodwill right away. Don't waste your money."
5,"I love this album, as indicated by my first draft","I reviewed this album 13 minutes ago, and now they're saying I didn't. Okay, so that's how it's going to be. Five stars...NO, 8 point 2 stars. Let's see them deal with THAT headache!!"
4,A great compilation!,"Made in AUT in 1999, Serial# CD-2700020090-B, Playing Time 77:33I find there are 3 degrees of southern rock: straightforward (like LYNYRD SKYNRD), commercial (like .38 SPECIAL), and scorching (like MOLLY HATCHET). I like all three, but MH represents, in my opinion, what's best out there.This compilation features tracks up to their 9th album, ""Devil's Canyon"", but mostly focuses on the material from their 1st (Molly Hatchet),2nd (Flirtin' With Disaster),4th (Take No Prisoners) and 9th. The material selected shows both power and versatility, along with their typical ""guitar attack"" sound. The band has seen a few singers, each with a great but rough voice.A word of warning: if you buy this, you'll want to add their albums to your CD collection."
5,can't go wrong,"Totally awesome recording. As with with most Greatest Hits, could include more tunes. But, unlike most Greatest Hits, these are ALL great hits. How can they not be, we're talikng Molly Hatchet here!! Another must have for any southern rock fan."
3,Accompanying Software,"This stereo is EXTREMELY cool. However, it is advertised with a programmable display for downloading your own screensavers, pics, etc. You must search to find this software. When you do have it, it just doesn't work right, Pioneer needs to perfect this before advertising it can be done!"
1,Ugh.,"You're going to want to go out and write letters to all of the members of Garbage after hearing this, expressing your sincere sympathy that it exists. The artist who did this album didn't even try to make the songs her own: she just tried to mirror Garbage (and failed miserably). Listen to ""The World Is Not Enough""....and you'll see what I mean."
1,Oh No!,"I haven't heard anything worse than this tribute album! Garbage is one of the best bands in the world and this tribute album shows no respect to them. Go and buy the original albums of Garbage to understand the difference and what makes them special, and if you have the original albums don't even think of buying this tribute cd. It's a waste of time and money."
2,"I only listened to the clips, not the whole cd.","It's coverbands who do sound a lot like Garbage. I am glad for the peeps out there who are puttin' out cd's. The band/s who recorded this cd are definately talented, but really did just do covers. No specific signatures or understood revamps. Plain old covers. The 'various artists' title could be seen as misleading. It's not anyone you've heard of yet. Note to band: hear me. I recall that 'Various Artists' did tributes to Tori Amos and Bjork.I almost bought them too, but they aren't fresh. Good tastes, but use your own recipe. love and luck"
1,This cd makes me glad.........,"that i m not bulimic b'cuz i wudve died from throwing up. Who ever tha lead singer is 4 special as homer simpson says it ""Suhux"" shes not scottish and she cant hits tha notes rite thank u and good nite"
4,Bermuda Triangle,"I have watched this VHS many years ago...I was captivated and intrigued...I was young and naive. I re-watched it a while ago and looking back and after watchin and reading other related articles,some of the stories were apparently unverified by Berlitz. The video is about Bermuda's mysteries , ships,planes,people going missing ,UFO's and Philadelphia Experiment...Take it with a pinch of salt and you'll enjoy it. Too bad there's no remastered copy of it on DVD or I would buy it.Don't believe everything that you hear or even see."
5,Great book for potential inn-keepers,This book separated the romantic notions of owning a B&B from the business end. It was eye opening and very informative.
4,Nepal Trekking DVD,Excellent and informative DVD for anyone going to the region it gives a good insight into a wonderful trip.
5,"A ""must read"" for teachers","I read Katherine Simon's book ""Moral Questions in the Classroom"" this summer with much interest and excitement. It seemed like such a great resource that I decided to introduce parts to my college students in our teacher education program and make a quick change in my syllabus. She includes examples of the missed and avoided opportunities for moral conversations, transcripts and explanations of several in-depth discussions of moral and existential discussions, and very cogent and sharp yet sympathetic analysis. These all impressed me deeply, and I look forward to the reactions of my students. I really think that every teacher, especially those in middle and high schools, should read and discuss this book. It would make a great book for teacher discussion groups, for teacher education classes, and for graduate programs in education."
4,Excellent!,Excellent Read!! I picked up Godiva because of the beautiful cover and was pleasantly surprised when it was a great read. I fell in love with the story and read it in one night.
5,A great puzzle,A large complicated puzzle - which is good. After working the puzzle I donated it to a medical facility for patients - something that will keep their minds busy while they heal. (The facility has many different puzzles already available for their patients.)
4,nice hat,"the hat came on time as described.good hat for outdoor work,fairly well built seems durable and is not to heavy."
4,Father/ Child Hobby,"This was purchased for my son-in-law who is going to be a new dad next month. He loves to golf, and I'm sure he will encourage his son to play, also. This way, they can spend time together. The Gund, My First Golf Bag Playset, is a unique baby toy. The soft, plush golf bag unzips, and holds a caddy, golf ball, club, and even a gofer! It's colorful, and very well made, which is typical of Gund quality. It's a great toy for age one month and up. And it would be appropriate for both boys and girls. Stuffed animals are great, but if golf is important to Mom and Dad, then this would be a great baby gift."
3,Cute item for baby but not for Toddler,"I purchased this for my son to carry around with him for his Halloween costume. I wish that the soft clubs were actual clubs, and not just club heads sewn into the golf bag. I was looking more for a soft ""real"" set of golf clubs. I am giving this to my 6 month old godson to play with. Super cute, just not what I was expecting for my 18 month old. It's a better toy for someone who is 6-12 mos."
5,Baby's First Golf Set,"As a golfer it's important to start the little ones off right. And as such, this toy is perfect. The gopher is just hysterical, and the other pieces are cute as well. Everything zips into the bag itself, so it's nice and compact and all the toys including the bag are plush and soft, as you would expect with a Gund product."
4,A Strong Recommendation,'Distant Moments' lovingly written and very descriptive gives the reader a look at life in New York City in the early 1900's. Angela's struggle to overcome obstacles in her young life in a new country with a new language gives insight to what every immigrant must go through. Simple tasks we Americans have taken for granted since most of our families melted into the big pot several generations ago.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend to you whole-heartedly.
2,Rather disappointing version,"Reading Grundy's new novel is comparable to visiting a gold-plated outhouse--its fabulous to look at outside but it sure stinks inside. It is certainly a well-written book, but his revision and literary license leave me puzzled and more than a little disturbed. Why the homosexual themes and scenes? Why tinker with story events and characters that were already sublime in the original texts? I guess I am too old to tolerate having gay political agenda shoved down my throat. This should have been a great retelling of a great epic, not a writer's egocentric need to flaunt his new, hip revision. What I find most dismaying is that people who have not read the other translations will read this and think this is a true rendition. Not so."
2,Grundy's Gilgamesh,"The epic saga of Gilgamesh is one of civilization's most enduring tales. Grundy gives us an intimate account of life in ancient Sumeria rich in texture. I was very impressed with the attention to details of everyday life Grundy brings to bear. Indeed we are well into the book by the time Enkidu and Gilgamesh first meet. At this point there is a clear shift in emphasis. The central focus no longer centers around the adventures of the two great heroes but on their personal relationship, the homosexual details of which Grundy never tires of presenting. If not for this one fatal flaw the book would have garnered at least four stars. Grundy is a gifted writer with a bright future. It is disappointing to see the story of Gilgamesh transformed into a vehicle for the advancement of a gay political agenda."
1,A waste of time.,"This reads like a very bad Harlequin Romance set in Sumeria. Bad research, bad writing, bad plot. I could not get past the first 100 pages without gagging so it went into the garbage can --"
4,Good,"Ordered Jan 12, came in today, the 19th. Decent shipping speed. The book is brand new like they said, a bit dirty though on the cover. They probably had it laying somewhere for a while. Good shipper."
3,Works backwards rather than forwards,"This book presupposes a belief in the Canon and tries to explain how it fits together. As this was not what I was looking for I felt disconnected from the thesis.If you are looking for what I was looking for which is ""Where did this Canon thing come from and how did what's in and not in it get there and come from"" I was looking for the origin of books, supposed authors, disputes over Paul and Pseudo Paul, etc.This is not that. This is more a kin to a biblical history of the Canon for use in exegesis.I'm tempted to give it one star, but its not a bad book. I'm just not the target audience.If you are looking for what I was looking for, check out ""The Canon of Scripture"" by F.F. Bruce"
2,disappointing...,"I can appreciate the first part of about the existence of God, and also Samuel Graham's writing style is interesting. But after that things go down hill fast. Like another reviewer said, ""I find his theology in the last half wanting"". He selects his scriptures to support something carefully, without giving the whole picture. Sorry, there are other books out there that are much more about seeking truth. Don't waste your time..."
5,"Introspective, Transcendant Beauty","Terrence Martin is, if not the best, one of the best singer/songwriters on the folk music scene today. If you are a folky poser and enjoy Ani De Franco, it's not for you. If you love REAL contemporary folk music, you'd be hard pressed to find a better album put out within the last 40 years."
2,Let's not be too breathless...,"...Anytime reviews compare some singer/songwriter to Dylan, it's intriguing, but inevitably does the guy no favors.I checked out the album and Martin has some musicality. But his songs seem derivative, not authentic. Take ""Bethlehem"" -- it's almost as though he saw that David Gray had success with ""Babylon,"" and Steve Earle with ""Jerusalem,"" and figured, ""Hey, Bible theme.""A friend said to listen to this guy. I'm rethinking the relationship."
4,a great resource,"i read the previous edition (1997) to the jobbank guide to computer and high-tech companies, and i must say that it was well-written. i'd recommend it for anyone looking to get an overview of who's who in an exploding industry. i'd also recommend a look at the VaultReports Guide to the High-Tech Industry, which was extremely insightful and a bit more of a fun read."
1,Terrible,The only thing good about this flick is the cover art. It was all down hill once the turtle like monster started dancing in the back yard with the kids... and it was a short hill to begin with.
2,Death Kappa,"A giant reptilian monster threatens Japan after group of crazed scientists unleash nuclear devastation over the land, and it is up to the kappa of ancient legend to save the world in DEATH KAPPA! Rather than paying homage to the classic Kaiju era in a reverent satire, DEATH KAPPA reduces itself to an idiotic spoof that is continually brought down by its sophomoric screenplay and dulled sense of humor. Director Tomo'o Haraguchi intentionally reveals the wires carrying the model planes, the false backdrops, and the cheapness of his scale miniatures for laughs, but each weakened attempt to poke fun at the genre falls flat due to the poor production quality and complete lack of wit. The horrendous costume designs for the two leading monsters do nothing to help, either. What we are left with is a muddled, disjointed mess of a film that is an embarrassment to Kaiju fans everywhere.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
1,Crap movie,"I did not enjoy this movie at all. Looked interesting when I saw the previews, but after purchasing I would not recommend it."
3,"No, no! Not the Kappa....","What. The. Frak. Yes, it is very probable that those three words will leave your mouth upon completion of this whackaroo of a movie. This movie is so out there, your reviewer was torn between awarding it one star out of disgust, or five stars for the sheer surrealistic nerve it must have taken to have made this movie in the first place. Roughly speaking, you can divide it into two parts (with an annoying narrator segueing you through each part and then some). The first half of the movie borrows heavily from the Manga/Anime' approach. The pacing and certain character reactions are almost cartoonish, and yes, very over the top. But that's nothing when you get to the second part of the movie. Then it becomes a parody of the old-school Godzilla movies, especially the motifs from Mothra. Good luck trying to wrap your head around this one."
1,Don't waste your money,"This could have been a good/funny movie...but it ain't. It has no heart. The humor is from the school of: ""Just Act Stupid, It's Easier Than Writing Anything That's Actually Funny."" This kind of parody really needs to be played straight. Intentionally bad special effects and all this winking at the camera and over-acting, and just plain bad writing makes DEATH KAPPA annoying and undercuts any attempt at humor. The (very, very) few times I saw something that was actually kinda funny in this movie I knew it was nothing more than a happy accident. Long review short: Just plain avoid this movie."
4,Kaiju stomps again!,"Well sure, the budget is low, the acting has tounges firmy in cheeks. The attack jet squadron is a flight of antiques with visible pantylines (I mean wires). But c'mon!!! The Japanese SDF has a Gorgon Monster Death Ray Unit!!!! And, our heroine - the pop-singer temple maid - can apparently survive a nuclear explosion without ruffeling her kimono. I hugely enjoyed this slice of very ripe cheese. Just keep the kappa's cranial plate well moistened and all will be well."
1,death kappa's resemblence,"The death Kappa monster looks like Rage Shenron from the shadowdragon saga of the DragonBall GT anime, if u watch a clip from english language DragonBall GT with rage shenron in it and hear his voice when he is in his smaller size, its funny, and then look at death kappa and remember what rage shenron sounded like. just search on yahoo ""rage shenron"" look on [...]"
4,Death Kappa,Death Kappa actually was a very funny movie to me.I was able to see a preview of it last weekend and I found it very entertaining. If you are a fan of Kaiju then you will love it. Some moments dont gel together as I may have liked but as the movie goes on and you see some of the effects you begin to feel the aura of the film. I think in the end it resinated more like a dark comedy in some ways. However I am anxious to see it again and myself and the other 20+ people around me all were having a great time watching it.A fun movie all in all
3,Birds like it,I gave the Edible birdhouse as a gift. They are nice and appear well made.It makes a great gift for anyone with a place to hang and veiw it. Not sure if I would keep it after the birds have eaten all the seeds. As a bird lover I would have preferred more Sunflower seeds and less Millet.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I was so excited about this product, because my 92 year old mother loves to watch the birds at bird feeders outside her house. We put this bird feeder up right away, some five months ago, and to date no bird has gone near it. I was willing to pay $60 for my mother's happiness, but it was a TOTAL waste of money."
3,"Works fine, but the display is way too dim!","You should be able to read displays easily with a quick glance, but forget it with this product! And, in general, why can't we get back to the days of the reasonably high-contrast, user-friendly displays (e.g., white on black, with bright, white characters)?Signed, Defender of the mildly visually challenged in Mountain View, CA."
4,Hidden jem,Bought this for one reason and his name is Ray. Thought it would have more from Ray but its still cool to hear the songs he is on. Dont think its a full release with him becasue it is not.
5,Great Voice Taken To Soon,This is a rare recording that features a couple of amazing musicians. Mike Starr who was the bass player for Alice in Chains and then later appeared on Celebrity Rehab on Vh1 and Ray Gillen. Gillen was best known for his group Badlands that featured Jake E Lee of Ozzy Osbourne fame. Gillan later went on to perform with Black Sabbath he recorded a album with them that until recently was unreleased. This recording is a great moment that captures him at his best with powerful soul drenched vocals. If you are a fan of hard rock or a fan of Ray's this is a great piece to have.If not a fan but looking for some straight forward in your face rock this one is for you.
1,Waiting for delivery!,"I ordered this heater on December 21, 2005. I am still waiting patientely for it to be shipped. Apparentely, the seller dosen't want to let this item go at the sale price. So they have chosen to grasp at the stall tactic, hoping I will cancel the order, therefore, being able to sell this heater at a higher price to an unsuspecting customer. I guess Amazon.com should screen their sales companies because with service like this I won't bother using them again!"
1,Why Offer For Sale If You Don't Want To Sell It?,"I ordered this item on Dec 30th, Delay, Delay, Delay....Guess what? Still no heater! It's not a Good Deal if they don't actually SELL IT! Finally cancelled , will buy from a Local Merchant that acually has one to sell."
3,Shop Heater,Heats well but not good for a shop with metal shop tools. Too much moisture in the Propane for un-vented heater. Doesn't take long for rust to appear on the tool surfaces. This would be true for any un-vented heater running on Propane.
3,Good Shop Heater,"I bought the model MH55FAV refurbished heater. The heater works fine. It is quite noisy but I expected that. But the hose that came with it is so stiff it won't lay down and is hard to stretch out to place the heater far from the tank, it keeps wanting to coil back up."
4,Mr Heater MH55FAV,Works great. I have and 18 x 18 uninsulated garage and it warmed it up enough that I was comfortable in a sweatshirt in ^20 degree weather. Only downside to me is the noise.
2,No usable hose,I bought this to heat up a portable structure so I could work on my boat. The heater does a credible job of getting a 13' x 20' x 12' space warm enough in our cold New Hampshire winters so I can work with just a sweater. There is a little gas smell but nothing like the kerosene heaters I've used and really not a problem to me. The reason for 2 stars rather than 4 is the hose that comes with this product does not have the connectors to work with a regular 20 lb propane container. I had to run off to Home Depot to BUY a gas grill hose to the tune of $15. How hard can it be to either explain that you need a different hose or supply one? I lost a 1/2 day horsing around with this to get it to the point where it could work. So figure an additional $15 dollars or so into the price and buy this product. It does what it says it does with little fuss.
3,This is fine.,"This product lasted me about 7 months then it started breaking. I like that it covers your phone the whole time, but it makes this little phone really bulky. I also had to take part of the cover off to charge my phone because the skin would push the charger out. It worked for a while, but it won't last the life of your phone."
3,not that great,"I bought this about 3 months ago and I am not all that impressed. Although it is a cool looking case, it has flaws. The part the covers the speaking end of the phone keeps slipping off. The case is difficult to remove from the phone and I found the clip not very comfortable, though functional. I took it off eventually and don't use it. If they can improve it a little, I would use it."
2,Sounded better in print,"This cellphone case looks like it would indeed protect my KRZR K1m from scratches, and maybe if I worked outside in harsher conditions with more scratching risks, it would be worthwhile. But I found the release mechanism that permits the case to detach from the belt clip to be clumsy and slow; the belt-clip is barely large enough to accept my standard-sized dress belt; and re-seating the case to the clip was uncertain (creating a risk of an accidental non-latch, with corresponding risks of losing the phone altogether). Moreover, the case itself ruined the aesthetic feel of the phone in my hand.I'm going to stick to my simple leather pouch with a flip-over magnetic closing."
2,The Body Glove KRZR K1m case,"The cell phone case is very nice and fits well; however, the opening for the battery charge plug was on the wrong side."
3,Don't buy this if you ever want to take it off your phone.,"This product is inexpensive and that's the only good thing about it. I found it extremely difficult to get on my phone, and once it was on, I just did not like how it looked and the added bulkiness. I got a slim phone for a reason I guess, and putting a cover over it detracts from that. The cover tore in half when I tried to remove it, so that is why if you put this on, intend to leave it on for good unless you decide you never want to put it back on!"
2,It's good if your looking for a permanent cover.,"The cover looked and fit great. The top part that goes over the screens went on a little hard and came off even harder. I actually had to rip the top cover off to get it off. Maybe this wasn't the product I was looking for because I was looking for something that I could take on and off as I pleased. The bottom part on the other hand comes off and goes back on quite nicely. All in all I would have to say that it was a good case for someone that wants to leave the case on permanently but if not, it's not the right case for you."
3,Body Glove Scuba II Cellsuit Review,"The Good:The body glove is easy enough to install on the phone and it protects the phone from scratches. There are 2 halves to the glove making installation fast. I don't use the belt clip and removed it from the glove. The unit fits in my pocket w/o being to bulky.The Bad:The plastic covers the camera lens. I took scissors to my plastic to remedy this situation.The leather slightly overlaps the USB/Charger port. The port cover isn't all that friendly to open w/o a case cover, so this is just annoyance.Dust seems to easily get under the plastic and the plastic bubbles in places.I didn't try any other cases prior to ordering the glove. I'm not sure that I even need a case since I'll be getting a new phone every two years under the Verizon service plan."
1,Stubborn Twig,This article was not worth the price. It shed no new light on the content of the book. I was very disappointed with this purchase.
2,I can't get my lens cover on it,"This certainly looks like a nice piece of glass. I got it for haze reduction and to protect my Canon 24-105 f/4 L lens. The only problem is that the front edge is so thin, I can't get my lens cap all the way on. It goes part way on but kind of wobbles. My other B + W filters (67 mm and 58 mm MRC UV filters) don't do this. I'm planning to order the B + W 77 mm filter instead. It seems like, if you're buying a filter for almost $100 to protect an $1100 lens, you have the right to be picky."
3,Sparkles! But too much repetition.,"The first three songs are excellent and infectious pop. Unfortunately after that, most of the tunes take on a monotonous I, IV, & V chord structure. I found myself aching for a 'minor' to be thrown in to clear my palet. If more songs on ""Melody"" were as interesting as the first three, I'd give this album 5-stars. Three-songs, three-stars."
5,the most original synth-pop album since Gary Numan!!!,"Ronnie Martin, frontman for Joy Electric, is about the most talented musician I have ever met. This album, his first under the name Joy Electric, is a showcase of what good pop music should sound like. Highly recommended if you are into techno, synth-pop, or experimental pop music."
5,Highly recomended,"The name of this product is confusing, but it is in fact just a standard (miniature) keyboard that will work with any Windows computer. There are other '595' type keyboards for sale on Amazon that are identical to this keyboard, except for color.This is very nice miniature keyboard, good key action, clean layout, well built, small enough so it can be used on the arm of an easy chair, which is how I use it. After lots of use, the only thing wrong with my last '595' black keyboard was the key markings were beginning to wear off. I like the look of this white keyboard.Comes with a long, high quality cord terminating in a PS/2 connector, but with a simple passive adapter it works fine as a USB keyboard, and this is how I use it. On the back are two rubbery strips (front) and two plastic flip down feet (rear) that can be used to tilt it up a little if used on a flat surface."
2,maybe 2 1/2 stars........,"i was dissapointed by this album. it is grouch, but with a style like you have never heard him before. dont get me wrong, i love grouch's music and i own every album, but he was trying something new this time and i just didnt like it.instead of having melodic beats like those on grouchs previous albums, daddy kev lays down more fast-paced beats. some of them are just strange. after listening to this you will know what i mean. grouch also sped up his flow on this. at times he almost sounds like Dose One, just mumbling and uttering words. on top of these things, the longest out of 11 tracks is only 2 minutes 42 seconds. seems like grouch rushed through this.maybe i am wrong and i am guessing a lot of people will disagree with me, but i wish i hadnt bought this cd. if you are expecting another f*ck the dumb or dont talk to me, dont pick this up. it seems more like expirimental hip hop than LL hip hop. sorry grouch fans"
1,poop,"smoke a bowl needs to go blow grouch. we all know he wants to. just because this is grouch doesnt mean it is good. this is trash. those noises you call symphony beats sounds like a trumpet blasting out of my a*s. the songs he ""rips backwards"" should be listened to backwards abd maybe it will sound ok. if you are a true hip hop fan, or even a grouch fan, you will understand that there is good music and bad music, this is bad music."
1,Pathetic power connection,"I can't say if this improved the signal to my computer because I refused to deal with the power cord issue long enough to find out. The slighest touch on the power cord or twisting the base even slightly to try a different angle caused the power cord to lose connection. The connection is not very tight, but this wasn't about the cord pulling out. The connection was iffy even when the cord was plugged all the way in. I think I could have gotten this to work, but just out of principle I won't deal with a product this poorly designed/made. I couldn't tell if it was a design flaw or a manufacturing problem, but I don't really care. It's going back to Amazon."
4,Beats hanging it off a wall socket!,Great inovation! Simple design does a super job of providing an excellent stand for the Airport Express! Just set the Airport in the stand and plug the included power cord into the nearest outlet. The position of the Airport makes checking the indicator light a snap and it is a much better arrangment than having the Airport hanging off a wall outlet or cluttering up a power strip.
3,Good idea - poor execution,"I like Griffin products as a rule, but this one isn't so good. First a problem with the fit of the power cord into the base unit. Mine ended up with the female receptor breaking away inside. I was able coax it back out, but this shouldn't have happened. Second the fit of the base to the Express isn't much better. Takes a lot of finessing to make this thing work. It shouldn't be that hard."
5,"An exciting, thrilling book.","This was the first Night World book I read, and it got me hooked. Hanna was a young girl in a prehistoric clan. She was killed by a vampire, Thierry, who didn't realize she was his one true love - his soulmate - until it was too late. Desperate, he asked a witch for help. Now, thousands of years later, 16-year-old Hannah Snow learns she is the latest reincarnation of Hanna. But Thierry's mortal enemy - the one who made him a vampire so long ago - wants to kill Hannah, and it may be that not even a powerful vampire's love can save her. She may need to save herself. This was an exciting, thrilling book that I really enjoyed and highly reccomend to teen horror fans."
3,Not the best read in the world,"I was quite disappointed with this book. In all her previous books Ms Smith has made the soulmate principle seem new and exciting, but in this it just seemed dull and like it had been told a thousand times already. Definetly the worst book in the night world series so far."
5,SOULMATE is a very good ..I mean great book.,"Soulmate is a very good book.Not suprising since L.J.Smith wrote it.I have almost all her books except The Secret Circle and Volume one and two of the Vampire Diaries.I cant find them anywhere.OK, now back to the book.Soulmate is my favorite Night World book.I agree with some people when they say someone should make a movie of all her books.I cant wait for Strange Fate to come out....if it ever will.When I'm older I hope I have as much talent as Lisa Jane Smith."
3,A good book,This was a good book but I think the soulmate thing is getting old. She should do a book that has all the soulmates in one. Mabey if they are hunting and come to tis girl who knows them all from L.J Smith books that she has read.
5,The best book I have ever read,This is the best book I have ever read and I read a lot. I love the soulmate principle.
3,Interesting,"L.J. Smith's magic still shines through with her captivating ideas of reincarnation and soulmates, but I tend to be disappointed with her Night World series. They're just too short and the endings are just too pat to be very satisfying. I loved the tragedy present in this one, but it's on the whole, not as gripping as some of her other works."
5,Amazing Christian Hardcore Which Has A Sound like No Other,"Attonement is a step above many hardcore bands. This album continues where other hardcore bands can have a dead stop. A blend of melodic hardcore , heavy vocals and oldschool hardcore influence that would appeal to any listener to hardcore music. Being christian hardcore , religion influences the lyrics ,but world issues such as abortion , racism and many others penetrate into the lyrics leaving a weld in your mind. I would reccomend purchasing this album because it is one of the best hardcore albums that has ever been recorded. It does not matter if you are christian or not because the music means something to all people."
2,Paint-by-the-numbers Hardcore,"If you've ever listened to hardcore, you've heard this album before. The grooves are hackneyed, as are the lyrics and the singing style. Nothing here is new, or particularly entertaining. Strongarm, just like almost every other Christian band, simply rehash the formula of their genre. Their second release shows a glint of originality, particularly in the lyrics. It isn't what you'll expect, and it might not be what you like. However, it's better than this."

5,One of the useful books for beginner,"Dr. Kleinsmith used to be my teacher at the University of Michigan. He taught me Biology of Cancer. The way he taught was excellent and this book of his really represents his talent in teaching. For those who do not have solid background in cell and molecular biology but want to learn more about it, this book is specially written for you. The material presented here, though not advanced, covers everything needed as a prerequisite for higher level biology. It is worth reading. I am sure that after you finish one chapter in this text, you will feel yourself know some biology better. Try it for yourself."
5,sencillamente lo mejor,"Los 20 exitos navide~os de Danny Rivera, esta fabuloso . Contiene una selecion inigualable,sencillamente me encanto. Lo recomiendo y garatinzo, que les va a encantar"
4,pretty not bad,"Pretty not bad but pretty not good either. RBBS doesn't break new ground here but does produce pleasing, catchy music. All in all, this is a talented group capable of a long and fruitful career, but this won't be the album they're remembered for."
5,Better than most,"Once again robert and the boys have done a wonderful job. They have evolved into a smoother sounding, more polished band. This CD doesn't leave my CD player. If you ever get a chance, see them live. The CD does not do them justice."
2,"bright idea, dim quality","I can say this about the Alert QPL-8 fluorescent work light: It is bright!And it uses waaay less power than those dangerously hot halogen work lights. Unfortunately, these lights are in a cheap plastic case with a flimsy metal bracket. For the price and purpose of this product I was expecting a robust case able to stand up to a construction work environment, but these won't last a week on a job site. If this was a $15 light, I'd enthusiasticallly recommend it. But it's nearly three times that price and I can only recommend it if you are very serious about saving electricity, such as living off the grid as I am. I'm hoping someone out there will make a well-made, low energy light as bright as these."
4,Great light; limited positioning options,"Excellent light output and all the advantages of a fluorescent (broad lighting, soft lighting, low cost of operation). At this price, the stand should be designed for multiple position mounting (hanging, rotating, etc.)Though Amazon shows the list price as $49.95, the manufacturer's full retail price is actually $39.95."
1,Stay away from this light!,"I have the Craftsman equivalent to the one here. It is identical to this light, but the Craftsman one is red in color.I had two of these work lights go out in 2 years. Both with the same problem, the internal fuse blew because the board had a short somewhere.I bypassed the fuse and one of the components started sizzling and smoking. Aint worth my time to buy a replacement component. Better to go into the trash bin."
3,Very bright but cheap,"As a automotive technician I need to see without getting burned. This light by far is the brightest I have ever owned. I'm going on my second one, the first fried, I already had a spare just in case.The build quality is lacking. 2 wire cord with no ground, light plastic housing will not take a drop, water or rough handling.However if you can get them for $20.00ish then its worth it. If it goes south, you haven't lost much.The fist thing I did to mine was to install a 3 wire industrial cord, and added a bungee cord with a hook to hang it. I also added weight to the stand to keep it from tipping.I would pay double if they would make a higher quality version."
4,Good Classic Mystery,"Though this was made for TV, it is a good old fashioned mystery that those over 35 will enjoy."
2,Poor Edit of Original Item,"When this program originally aired as a made for TV 'Mini-Series,' it was very good. I recorded it, and still have it. This version only runs 95 minutes, and most of the story has been edited out, and many of the details are missing. As an example, the scene where Dr DeForge tells Mary Ashley to go to the pharmacy is missing, not to mention the discovery at the pharmacy. Why couldn't they make this a two tape set, and present a complete version? My own recording is much better."
1,Shame to sell half of a movie.,"I too, have recorded this movie when it was shown on TV in 2 parts. Unfortunately, my copy didn't turn out too well. Once one has seen all of it, can't emagine half a movie being any good. I thoroughly enjoyed this thriller. Lets hope the production company has brains enough to release it again, but d the whole version rather than the cut in half and on DVD. I would be the first to buy it."
4,good movie sorta good picture quailty,"the story was very good, as i remember the book. the picture quality was almost poor. it was acceptable, just not great."
1,Too much Asian language on the case.,"When one looks at this DVD case, it looks as if it was stolen in Asia and smuggled into the USA. I wonder....? Hesitant to even put it into my player."
3,Faithful TV adaptation,"This film is a very faithful adaptation of Sidney Sheldon's novel about Mary Ashley, a university professor who's appointed as US ambassador to Romania, only to realize someone wants to kill her. The plot follows the book very closely so there'll be no surprises for viewers who've read the book. And there's not much suspense but it did keep my interest and I wasn't bored by it. Still, there's nothing that sets it apart from hundreds of other similar TV movies. A weak 3 star rating, may have been a stronger 3 star rating if I hadn't read the book."
5,Old school punk rock at its best,The blamed play real punk rock music. None of that poppy stuff. They just play in your face punk rock. This band will not dissapoint if you're into old school Punk.
3,make it simple,It was a very difficult read to start with. I know he was a scientist but he could have left out all of the technical data. We just want to putt better. We can't discuss the scientific reasons we putt bad with our buddies if we want to remain friends.
4,golf engineering,If you understand and enjoy physics you will enjoy Pelz. He uses science to explain our emotional game so that we can play better and better understand our successes and failures.
4,Ron Stonestreet Golf Instructor would recommend this book,"Dave out did himself on this one, better than Put Like the Pros, this will help anyones game."
2,Rocket Science?,Chock full of brilliant glimpses of the obvious. Only someone with a research engineer's background could take a few basic principles and turn them into a 396 page tome extoling the virtues of simplicity. You won't put any better after reading this book but you will know 125 reasons why you are missing. Dave proves that 84% of all statstics are made up.
4,"Great, but not the dramatic impact of Short Game Bible",I first read the Short Game Bible and found this really improved my game. I did not find the putting book to have that dramatic an input but it was still very insightful and helpful.(21 handicap)
1,Not as god as Peltz's Short Game Bible,I purchased the Putting Bible after reading the excellent Short Game Bible by Peltz. I was disapointed by the Putting Game Bible and feel that it was written to capitolize on his very successful Short Game Bible. The book did not really add anything to my knowledge of putting and seemed wordy as if Peltz was trying to find ways to fill a book.
4,Putting Classic,"This book has been around for a long time. However it contains so much useful info to help improve your putting. I was able to find it as a ""used"" book at significant discount and it's much better than buying a new putter and ""hoping it fixes your problem"" !!"
1,More advise that is impossible to implement,"Dave Pelz is starting to tick me off. If you thought his ""Short Game Bible"" was demanding, wait until you see this book. In it he insists that the only route to improvement is to practice his ""pils"" stroke until you've done 20,000 repetitions. And that's just for starters. Call me wacky, but I find that downright discouraging. I'm as dedicated to improving my golf game as the next guy, but jeez I've got a job. I don't have all day every day to wire myself up with all of his feedback gadgets in order to have ""meaningful"" practice. In fact, by his standards my feeble practice sessions are only guaranteeing my mediocrity. He'd have me just quit. Interesting and illuminating scientific discoveries aside, no non-professional golfer could possibly follow his 15-point/47-rule improvement program. Hence, while I predict that every golfer on earth will buy Pelz's book (and most will give it a positive review), I also predict that no one will follow his advice."
3,Very Disorganized,"I was excited to get this book after getting Pelz's Short Game Bible, which is excellent. This book , however, is quite different. While The Short Game Bible presents a clear and simple plan to improve, the Putting Bible does not. It's quite disorganized, in fact. What is particlarly annoying about the book is that you'll read in the first several chapters ""...and we'll cover that later..."" He just starts to get into a concept and then leaves it, claiming he'll come back to it in the later ""technique chapters."" It's just not a simple book to read and glean information from. I'd have to say that my putting did not improve as a result of the book, and that's partly my own fault. The problem is that Pelz makes it very easy to learn just enough to get you into trouble (i.e., forget how to putt), and then put the book down. Buy it, and especially read it - with great caution."
4,The Tradition Continues,For those like me that thought Dave's Short Game Bible was great... this is a must read. The book goes into a level of detail in putting that I have not witnessed in 45 years of playing the game.
1,"Great book for scientists, engineers and librarians!","Once again, Dave Pelz reduces the game to mechanics and physics and ignores the most important aspect of good putting which is freeing your mind from the specific mechanics of the physical stroke.Having said that, this book is chock full of interesting facts, most of them completely useless to the average player who wants to improve his putting. Pelz's book does not address the fact that great putters such as Jones,George Low,Palmer,Stockton, Crenshaw and Faxon have utilized widely different strokes,grips and tempo.What they all had in common was a consistent pre-shot routine,tremendous feel,and supremeconfidence that they could hole every putt.Readers looking for technical answers to better putting, which is the focus of this rather unorganized book are probably going to be disappointed."
5,Dave's Putting Bible,"Wow! Everything you wanted to know! Whether you are a disciple of Dave's technique or not, you should still add this important Bible to your Golf Library. It has a great deal about how to read greens, determine speed, line and different approaches toward putting. Dave starts with building blocks to give you a complete education in putting. Reading this book is a must but you will go back again and again, as there is always some detail you have missed. If you have a face balanced putter, this is exactly the book you need and have been searching for. If you do not want to get bogged down in the technical details of putting, you can skim but you will miss much."
4,poor putter,If you are analytical this is the book for you. Very well explained with lots of supporting statistics.
4,a must read for golfers,"a comprehensive book on putting. A little repetitive and long to read but with some very important address, swing and strategy ideas.Only the pure pendulum swing is covered. Golfers with other type of putting swing may not agree with Pelz's technique."
5,Fantastic,"Robters and Roberts' Ending Intimate Abuse is an informative and compelling book which is hard to put down. Professionals, Academics, and all women will find the research and practical information helpful. This is a realistic self-help guide with practical resources and services. This is a must-read for all dating women, young and old."
4,be careful,"The idea of ancient, medieval and renaissance music rearranged for harpsichord, caught my curiosity. Well, none of that here. Basically 17th century harpsichord music. having said that, and to be fair to the artist, the compositions and the performance was pleasant enough. good for a sunday morning listen."
2,On line purchase warning,"This purchase was most disappointing. It is not really a ""book"" at all, but appears to be binding of copies produced on a standard copying machine. The size is an absurd (for a normal novel or work of fiction) 11 inches by 81/2 inches, but of course that is the size of regular copy paper. The font is the usual typewriter font and the print is so pale that it is barely legible under a 60 watt reading lamp.I have not even attempted to read this awful creation despite its being written by such a fine author, and the only reason it has escaped the waste basket is so that it may be shown to friends, colleagues, partners etc., to serve as a caution when purchasing reading material on the internet."
1,Look Out!,"I am a mountain biker and loved the idea of being able to view the screen while riding. BUT the mounting bracket does not hold the explorist well enough. I watched my explorist unit fall to the ground on the first ride and thought I just didn't have it clicked into place. Wrong, because after putting it firmly into the bracket I lost the unit on the next downhill. I was luck enough to find the unit but will never use it on my bike or ATV due to fear of losing it."
4,Magellan Explorist Bike Mount,"The mount works well. I read elsewhere that people added velcro to make the mount more secure. I find that if you make sure the little plastic tab on the mount snaps into the small hole on the GPS, usually with an audible click, the mount is very secure. However, I must admit, I don't do the roughest biking (jumping over logs etc.). I would have given it five stars, but a have had a little trouble with is trying to rotate on the handle bars. I kept having to tighten it up. Seems firm now however."
2,Poor design for mountain bikes,"This mounting bracket has a number of shortcomings that make it difficult to recommend. First, mountain bikes typically have handlebars that are wide at the stem and taper and bend towards the grips. If you have a mountain bike there is a good chance the bracket will not fit your handlebars well. Second, if it does fit, the weight of the eXplorist will cause the bracket to twist as you ride unless you really tighten it. This is especially bad if you have a carbon bar. You may be able to mount the bracket close to the stem so that it also rests against it for support. This will keep it from rotating while riding.If Magellan had made the metal parts of the bracket so that it could be rotated by 90 degrees it could be mounted on the stem. This is a far more stable area for something heavy. Unfortunately this is not the case. As another reviewer mentioned, most bicycle lights have better mounting designs."
3,Clumsy but effective,"Clunky design. If you're not careful, the GPS doesn't click securely into the bracket. Your first warning that it isn't seated is the crash of the GPS unit onto the pavement. The mounting screws come without lock-nuts, and they loosen, letting the bracket rotate out of place. Switching the bracket from bike to bike is a real pain. And that price! For half the suggested price of this bracket, you can buy a high-powered, long-life bike headlight with a GREAT mounting system. Since there's no competiting product -- and the bracket does work if you put lock-nuts on the screws and pay very close attention to snapping the GPS unit in securely -- I'm recommending this product for those who need it. However, if TomTom or Garmin comes up with a better bike-mounting bracket, it will be the deciding factor when I select my next GPS."
4,Sturdy and Solid Mount,"Holds the eXplorist nice and safe on the handlebars.All the other items on my ""bike's dash"" have strong plastic brackets to go around the bar, I was surprised to see this one uses a METAL bracket. I hope it doesn't rust, there isn't any other steel on my bike other than the clamp bracket on this mount. They do include a piece of rubber to put around the bar first before you clamp this metal clamp, so you won't damage your bar, I just hope it doesn't end up rusting.There are also two posts that stick out on the sides (used for the car mount, they have no use here at all, Magellan just using the same piece from the same mold to save money)The posts meant I had to take off something else on my bar, but I will cut off the posts and then I can fit everything back on again."
3,Good product high price,Product is good. Holds GPS tight but is a little expensive for holding my $100 GPS to my four-wheeler. Broke one trying to get the cover off my four-wheeler after a 6 inch ice storm. I think the quality is good it just probably broke because it was really cold and the cover was frozen to the bike. It was good enough I bought another one but never mounted it since I really don't use my GPS anymore. My friends have GPS's now so I just make sure I don't lose them and get lost.
4,It's good for you!,"Man o man o man. These guys have hit it on their second effort. If that first groove (""Record Store"") doesn't grab you, you cannot be grabbed. Excellent cover of Randy Newman's ""Little Criminals"" accompanies some excellent groovy Memphis funky stuff. ""Land of Soul"" brings a Tipitina's backbeat to a Memphis state of mind - Otis, Rufus and Booker T - be proud!"
5,Jello Biafra's Third Spoken Word Album,"This spoken word album, by ex-Dead Kennedys vocalist Jello Biafra, tackles a wide variety of topics including the Gulf War, Marijuana and other drug prohibition, censorship, sexual repression, and his 1979 run for mayor of San Francisco against the now California Senator Dianne Feinstein.As of this date (6/97), Jello Biafra has released four spoken word albums. Look for:No More CocoonsHigh Priest of Harmful MatterBeyond the Valley of the Gift PoliceEND"
3,Just What You'd Expect,"Being an avid fan of Jello, I regret saying that this album was less than you can usually expect from him. This is 2 CDs jammed full of preaching to the choir. The only spectacular item on this album is ""Running for Mayor"", which I thoroughly enjoyed. If you're a fan, you should have this for the classics like ""Die for Oil, Sucker"" and ""Grow More Pot"". (WARNING: Alternative Tentacles and Jello will get more money if you order straight from them!) www.alternativetentacles.com"
5,"Absolutely stunning, a mix of wit and truth","This is a stunning spoken word with afew roars of agreement from Jello's audience. This will change your view on the american goverment forever this features the mix of wit and truth of his most well known spoken track ""America should grow more pot"" He is close to being the new voice of the generation X, more of a shock he already is."
3,What happened?,"This book started out great, loved the short chapters, got into the characters, but as soon as the main characters meet it all falls flat! Very anticlimatic for sure. Skimmed the last 5 chapters just to get it overwith."
2,Eccentric Post-Punk,This release is a collection of EP's The Wolfgang Press released in the mid-eighties. The music has great variety and can best be described as a soulful cross between Bauhaus and early Talking Heads. Singer Michael Allen fits the profile of the typical British eccentric and sings with a pronounced English accent. The EP's are in chronological order and trace the band's evolving sound from post-punk pop to more horn-oriented sounds and then to a funkier sound which in later years would become a more club-oriented sound(with eccentricities intact). Allen's singing may be an acquired taste for some but is nevertheless an effective emotional tool in the same manner as Nick Cave's for example. Overall a highly recommended release.
1,Unless you are a physics major...this game is pretty lame,"If you are trying to brush up on your high school physics, this game is for you!!! Otherwise, don't waste your money."
4,"Fascinating overview of ""operations and tactics"" on the Eastern Front","This is an extremely useful text that discusses in detail the tactical and operational aspects of the German battles on the eastern front. The weaknesses are (a) poor maps (get your own map of European Russia circa 194X) and (b) choppy organization caused by assembling the manuscript from many memos and a draft of Raus' autobiography. Even with faults this is a true ""must read""."
4,Enjoyable poetry for escapism,I'm normally not big on poetry but I highly recommend Down For The Count by G. W. Down.I found every poem captured my interest and conjured up images in my mind: It was great to escape to the places the author creates so skillfully in his poems.
4,Feeling up over Down For The Count,"I really enjoyed this book of outstanding poetry. The poems painted pictures in my mind and seemed to be written for me personally, as I was able to relate to them. This is a fine book of thought-provoking poetry."
2,not what i expect,"I thought this ""no salt"" herb would be similar to Mrs. Dash, but apparently it's not. It's basically large pieces of herbs mixed together. I was expecting a more finer and grinder version of herbs such as Mrs. Dash orginial blend."
4,Works well for a non adjustable cutter,"Works well for a non adjustable blade. Had it know for 3 months and it shaves nice clean 1/8 "" pieces when drawn over the top."
1,Avoid at all costs,Same problem as first reviewer. Circuit board burned out. $400.00 repair. Not worth fixing.
2,Does anyone make a 5-star oil mister?,"Desperate for an oil mister a few months back, I checked around and found that no mister available anywhere on the Web for less than $25 was getting good reviews. Almost everyone had something bad to say about the mister they'd purchased.When I found the Norpro 790 on Amazon there were no reviews, but it looked nice and the price was right, so I thought I'd give it a try.After a few months of use, here are my findings--Pros:* Good looking.* Decent price.* Stainless steel exterior rather than plastic.* Good size.* Works, but...Cons:* Like many misters, you can blow out the bottom if you pump it too much.* In order to get a fine, well-spread mist you have to pump it to the point where you almost blow out the bottom.* When pumped, the cap will not sit flush. Ruins the look.* The nozzle itself is not of the best quality.* Can be inconsistent in its performance for no apparent reason.So overall, it's okay, but nothing to write home about."
2,"Nice, but not sturdy",Broke after less than 4 months. A seal isn't holding anymore and won't hold pressure for more than a few seconds. Doesn't seem to be repairable.
1,Try pre-loaded oil sprayers instead,"I guess misters are hard to make because most of the ones I have bought in my life don't work out of the box or die shortly after.This one didn't even work out of the box. There was no mist, just air. Oh well, I figured I was taking my chances anyway. If you buy this, hopefully you have better luck.Update: Nowadays, most grocery stores sell pre-loaded, pressurized, non-refillable spray canisters of olive or canola oil such asPam Olive Oil Cooking Spray. It's like a can of bug spray or Lysol except it sprays oil. I have found that these work perfectly and last a surprisingly long time."
1,"Good design, not-so-good quality","I bought this at a local store half a year ago as I liked the design, but I should have seen this page before that. As the first reviewer says, I've blew out the bottom maybe because I pumped it too much. Now the oil is leaking from the bottom. And this is also really true: ""* In order to get a fine, well-spread mist you have to pump it to the point where you almost blow out the bottom."""
1,Misto makes the 5-star oil mister!,"The norpro is poorly constructed, and won't last long... Misto makes several that get great reviews, and they run $9.99 to $15 each."
2,Norpro 790 oil mister,I purchased this NorPro 790 about 8 months ago and used it several times a week. Eventually it started not holding pressure and now it only occasionally spits out a weak solid stream. I would guess that the seal has failed and there does not seem to be a place to readably purchase a replacement seal. Great idea with poor support.
2,Broken already,"I bought this from TJ Maxx expecting to be getting a great deal. Luckily, I only paid $3 something for it, because that is about what it is worth.When I first bought this, it worked well. I loved being able to spray my own olive oil onto the pan. The problem is that the seal broke. About 2 or 3 months after buying, the seal broke. Without the tight seal, the pressure in the bottle comes out the side and doesn't allow the oil to be ""sprayed"". Very dissappointing. Now, I'm looking for another one."
2,Poorly written but good material,"The book contains some valueable information about how deal with life but it is written so poorly, its hard to get through the book. It is written somewhat like a bad account of a conversation with the author."
4,Working on Being a Diva,I saw this book several months ago and was tempted to pick it up but didn't. I am so thankful that I ran across it again and ordered it. I truly enjoyed this book and saw some familiar biblical characters from a fresh perspective.McKinney-Hammond does a wonderful job of dispelling the myths of being a diva and giving a Biblical outlook on the subject. Also included are some really thought provoking and wonderful tips on improving yourself. This book not only helped identify some weaknesses but gave some tidbits for improvement. I can't wait to try some of the recipes included!I really enjoyed reading this and will pass it on to others. One last thing - I recommend reading the Biblical passages referenced for a better reading experience.Kristy M. PhillipsSister 2 Sister Book Club
5,Transforming Life...,"I picked up the book at the airport in Ft Lauderdale and didn't put it down until the end. Extremely inspirational, thought provoking with tremendous insight. Powerful women with exceptional attitudes... seeing them through the eyes of Michelle truly established a wonderful perspective of The Diva Principle!"
5,Divalicious,This book was phenomenal and has really motivated me in many ways to get my life in check and in order. Very well written. I love that the author pulled the women out of the bible to exemplify Divas. Excellent
2,Half Good,"I got the heater over 2 weeks ago. The heater itself I would give 5 stars. The heater works just as advertised. The variable btu control works good and the thermostat does a good job of controlling on / off to maintin a good working temperature in my garage. Now the bad part. The propane hose that is supplied with the unit is junk! It is like a recoil spring that will not straighten out even when warmed. So bad that I will be replacing it with a better quality hose. I wrote to Mr. Heater over a week ago giving them a chance to make it right. I asked them to send me a better quality hose. Not even an email reply, And of course, no hose. If I had to rate the hose separately it would not get any stars. If you want a good heater, by all means buy this one but be prepared to replace the hose."
5,Great sound!,"I Love the music, love the composer. It has a full rich sound and brings to life the composition by Satie."
5,On Satie,"I had heard a little bit of Satie years ago at my father's house on a piano program. Since then I've been determined to get a Satie CD. Anyway, I found this CD and it was wonderful."
4,Not what I expected but it was a good deal,It does seem that after to first few songs there are some adults and/or much older kids singing along with some of these songs. It's just ok. I wouldn't say I love the CD.
2,Are we listening to the same cd?,"Very dreary song selection. I was hopinig for something more upbeat for my child. The entire middle of the cd is somber and contains adult singers... not very good ones either. The songs actually sung by children are accompanied by a single pianist. It very much sounds like an elementary school choir recital... not something worth paying money for. This was not a ""deal""... but, a waste of money."
2,Invest your money in a different Christmas CD.,"I suppose I can't complain too much, I needed a few dollars worth of product to round out my order, so I choose this because of its (overall) glowing reviews. I think from now on I will only buy CDs that I can preview. It got listened to once, that's it. My daughter loves music, especially Christmas music, and this was NOT a hit for her. The quality is less than stellar."
5,Wonderful CD,We bought this for our grandson to listen to during his lunch time but found that the entire family enjoyed the carols. It is a great Christmas album to be enjoyed by all ages. We will enjoy it again next year.
5,Wonderful and warm songs for Christmas,All the familiar Christmas songs performed by a full-sounding children's choir . . . wonderful! I played it over and over during the holidays.
5,Talented!,"What first hits you when listening to this CD is the powerfull songwriting of Lindsey Williams, and how the music of his talented bandmates glides right along with it. It's hard to find a CD these days that you can put in and listen to start to finish, but Another Detour takes you for a ride that leaves you wishing for more! Tracks such as the epic ""here in the now"" will remind us all of our own trials. Then ""Prophecy of James"" will have whistling and singing James Taylor all afternoon! Ive seen these guys(and girl) live probably more than anyone, and I can tell you that they make the live music scene in Evansville IN. a much better place. CHECK THEM OUT!Jeremy VanWinkle bartender @Breakers"
3,Great - but use as a second choice,"I purchased this book to get ideas and learn how to make bouquets for a wedding. The bouquets pictured were varied and the pictures beautiful but the instructions were not detailed enough for me. I then purchased the book New Inspirations in Wedding Florals. The details in this book are great - very specific and accompanied by great pictures. Once I had read the second book, the instructions in the first book now became clear."
5,Florist Review Book,"I recommend anything from Florist Review. This book is good for beginners, it gives good detailed instructions with pictures too, which is always helpful!"
4,Easy to install. Looks great,It took just seconds to install. It is made of plastic no porcelain. It looks great anyways.
2,Still not really Discharge.,"I had my hopes up for this record, because I couldn't believe the Bones/Rainy/Cal line-up was back together. I'd heard Discharge were back to a more ""hardcore"" sound. I was foolishly hoping this would sound like Hear Nothing or Why. While not quite as ""metal"" sounding as the last few records, it still sounds closer to Shooting Up than anything else. I can't believe this is Bones on guitar. He has a very generic, thin, crunchy sound now, as opposed to his old wall-of-noise style. For what it's worth, I personally like Grave New World more than this record."
4,FINALLY this gem is available domestically!,"After finding this on vinyl at a used record shop in the early 90s, I was thrilled to find it was available on CD as a Japanese import back in 1997. The $29.99 + shipping price tag was prohibitive, but in the end it was well worth every cent.This is, imho, Cetera's finest work. It has a much more raw sound and feel of his later more polished A/C super-saccharine ballads. This is Cetera when he still liked to cut loose and rock. The album is just plain fun from start to finish with not a bad track to be found.Stand out tracks include the opening rocker Livin' In the Limelight (with Toto's Steve Lukather on guitar), On the Line (which was the side 2 opener on the LP-- the piano on this track is pure fun and a joy to listen to), Practical Man, and the album's closer Ivy Covered Walls.Now that this gem, is (long overdue) available in the US at a much more affordable price it's an even greater buy!"
4,Can't get it outta my head,"Great new track, has that ""catchyness"" that makes you wanna listen too it over and over. The video has that ""artsy"" feel to it as well. Cathy Dennis (writer of the track) did a superb job. It is nice to see Kylie always expanding her horizons when it comes to writers and producers. Suzy Ling's negative review (actually she never has positive reviews) should start listening to someone else since she has not liked Kylie's music in some time. It's for the best Suzy..."
2,Kylie's Song is already Out of My Head,"'I Can't Get you Out of My Head' has a good beat and ok vocals, but this Brit reads mediocrity all over. It's like techno-ish, with pop. This is basically the norm in white music today. Don't waste your money on this. Download it, and buy Pain Is Love (Ja is pimpin) or Janet."
5,Still not sick of this song!!,"Thankfully, Kylie is now worlds away from her AWFUL Stock, Aitken & Waterman days. This is the first song from her new 'Fever' album which is just amazing. Try listening to this song and NOT turning the volume up. Impossible!"
4,"Nice, but not very spacious!","I really like the bag, but despite reading the measurements, pictured it to be bigger than it actually is. It's pretty narrow, so not much fits into it. I've started using it exclusively as the baby bag I take when I go to the gym and leave my son in the daycare there...not my initial plans for it! It is, however, very pretty!"
5,great purchase,i bought this for my hubby ... he is such big fan of this band.... he enjoyed it sooo much....it was a great buy....You should try it too :)
4,Very Good,"If you are a Dream Theater fan you oughta have it, this is an excellent concert, with the best muscician that you could hear. It's recomended"
5,Bucarest is not Budapest,The disk 2 has a wrong information.The Great Debate (Live in Budapest 7/4/02) is false. This is Live in Bucarest!!!
4,good but not great,"This is a decent offering from the boys, but the 1st setlist is pretty horrid. None of those songs really show off the band's potential and some are just plain boring. Getting into the 2nd setlist we see the progressive monster that Dream Theater have become. The dvd is put together well enough and there are no audio glitches to speak of. The documentary and bonus songs are pretty cool, but I would have enjoyed some commentary from these guys like their first 2 dvds. All in all an enjoyable experience, but topping Budokan will be nearly impossible at this point."
2,"Good image quality, sounds really bad","I don't know what made Dream Theater change the previous dvds sound editing formula, but this is really far away from the Budokan dvd. Is it only in my case or drums are totally low, I can't even distinguish what Mike is hitting. Guitar is really loud. I had high expectancy on this dvd because of the songs list and the fact that it would be orchestrated. Now I know that the Budokan dvd remains the best."
5,Essential Dream Theater,"This is the must own live Dream Theater experience. The performance is flawless and you will be surprised how awesome the set list works, considering how odd it sounds.Be certain to watch the concert IN ITS ENTIRETY. I don't believe that Metropolis will have the same effect if you don't, and trust me, you're going to want the full experience from Metropolis :)"
4,Dream Theater Still Has It,"Dream Theater. 20 years and they're still going very strong. Score really shows that they haven't burnt out and are ready to keep on rolling. This DVD features a simply amazing concert. The orchestra is a nice touch, and their use in Six Degrees is really good.The problem I have is the same I have with Metallica's S&M;, they orchestra is underutilized. It only compliments, but doesn't really make a difference in the music.Still, this DVD is a must have for Dream Theater fans. The bonus features, while not as numerous as Live at Budokan's, are great. And Portnoy's tux shirt is awesome too."
4,DT 20th Anniversary Tour DVD,"This DVD is the best representation I have seen yet on Dream Theater. Not that others have been bad, but this is the best. I experienced one flaw in it, which disturbed me a little. There was a dead spot on one of the song performances, which might be inherent with the ""live"" filming. This is why I would limit my rating to 4 stars. Overall, it is a great DVD to have if you are a fan of great progressive rock."
4,"Some five star songs, but a four star DVD","I love the idea of a concert with an orchestra, especially when the band is worthy of orchestral backing (take note, Metallica). Overall this was a great dvd, but i thought the song selection takes away from it a little (not a lot). I would have liked to hear more old stuff, but I guess I can't have my cake and eat it (never understood why I couldn't). Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence was great, as was Octavarium (I LOVE that continuum!), Metropolis, and the entire orchestral part of the show. i just thought there wasn't enough diversity in the first set.My only other complaint is that the cameras in every Dream Theater DVD bounce around too much. Take note, mike portnoy- we wanna see musicians for more than half a second at a time. I realize it is hard to make a concert DVD perfect, but I am grateful to Dream Theater for putting so much material on DVD. More bands (see Symphony X) need to take note!!"
2,"Great video, mediocre and unrealistic sound quality.",First of all I am a huge DT fan and I love most of their music. However having superb home theater and being able to get the most out of music this DVD fails in that it has been so badly mastered. The previous DVD Live in Budokan was a masterpiece in every aspect but this DVD has fantastic video quality but music sucks. What happened with Portnoy's drums they sound like $500 Pearl Custom drumkit; sound muffled and cheap. The music is performed by superb musicians why can't transfer their performance in DTS sound done by a professional (just like on Budokan Live DVD). This is by far the best performance from Labrie who is so impressive. I couldn't finish watching the DVD as I was listening to the seventh song I started to fall asleep. I can't recommend this DVD instead try DT Live at Budokan.
3,PRETTY BAD SOUND,"Ilove this band, but I have to say that they did no good job on this dvd..the sound quality sucks..you cant hear the singer, the drum sounds like a cheap kit, and the bass is missing....what a shame for this extraordinary band..they dont deserve this..I have live at the budokan, scenes from ny and this one..and this is the worst..."
1,On and on pounding!,"Sorry that I can't post a -5 STAR rating. A friend of mine just bought this DVD, and I happened to be there for the showing, and soon found out that I picked the wrong night for a visit.Harmonic guitar rifts, intricate bass lines, endless drum rolls and a screaming-out-of-key vocalist (using the term loosely) rambling on with artsy lyrics only to be broken up by a crunching in time break.I guess that every generation has it's share of bands that are VOID-OF-RHYTHM and rely on pure musician school timing and these guys are the poster child for ""Concert of the Boring!"""
1,Worst Summerslam of all time,"This event comes from the early part of the WWFE's ""Dark Ages"" and it really shows. The ""main event"" between Bret and Owen hart had to be moved to the midcard because the WWFE were afriad that if they put it on last the fans would walk out before the finish. Elsewhere the clique hog the IC and Tag Titles, Lex Luger is jobbed because he was more popular than Bret or Diesel, and othe guys with bad gimmicks ""rassle"". Altogether a truly awful show."
4,50' Industrial cord reel,This item works well to wind up the cord quickly. There is a swivel so the case moves in different directions and it has a release clip if you need to move it from it mounted location. I didn't realize how heavy it would be but 50 ft of cord is a lot. All in all it is working well for me.
2,arrived broken,Arrived broken. Unmounted and disassembled. The spring that locks it in place was to long. Fixed and now works great. Very convenient.
5,Great Reel!,"I have a wheeled shop-vac that I use often to suck up debris from the garage, side yard, and shed. I was tired of having to wrap up the dirty extension cord after each use, until I stumbled upon this product. Once mounted, this Reel will not only keep your extension cord clean, convenient and organized, but with a quick tug, it will retract on its own. This product makes doing your chores even easier. I would recommend it to everyone with two thumbs up!"
1,Not durable,"Worked well for about a year. Then, the plastic housing that holds the spring broke, rendering it useless. I used in a residential garage with low usage."
3,It's okay,"It is sturdy, and the cord retracts really well, but the extension plugs do not allow for certain other plugs to plug into it. This means using a 3 rd plug. Frustrating and inconvenient ."
5,So Nice!,"Never again will I drag cords around the garage; I mounted this up next to my garage door opener and used the one open outlet for it. I now can vacuum anything without the cord being in the way, never have to reel up a dirty/dusty cord. This thing is outstanding!"
5,Excellent Product,"Not sure why they bother putting in a dedicated circuit breaker on this unit, but the unit is, in general, an excellent product. I mounted it overhead in the shop, as I have my power tools on rollers and move them frequently. The reel works great -- I never have to fight to get the cord to stop where I want, and the retract is also excellent. Also, the molded plug and receptacle are both great -- I expect to get many years of good service out of this unit."
1,Alert 50-Foot Cord Reel,The third time I went to use my cord reel the recoil broke. I took it apart to see if I could repair it and a plastic piece inside the coil had broke. Not worth the price I paid. You would think they could make the inside coil area with better materials. Do not recommend!
1,Poor quality,Purchased 3 weeks ago. Installed in garage from ceiling. Worked fine when using about 10-12ft of cord. The first time I extended to about 25 ft the rewind mechanism failed. Only redeeming aspect was that it failed early and I was abled to return it for refund. I would not recommend.
5,perfect,"bought this jersey for my Girlfriend, fit perfectly and is made well. would buy this type of jersey again any day."
3,Good reference.,This was the first martial arts book I bought back in 1984 as a young 13 year old student of Shotokan karate.I found it a valuable souce of information when trying to understand those early techniques.Worth having in your collection for its break down of basic techniques and generally sound information.
2,Mediocre at best,"Interesting attempt by a film maker to document the impact of ""celebrities"" and TV on politics. Nothing really new here, a bunch of well intentioned actors and actresses travel to the DNC and RNC conventions in 2008 to observe and learn. No real surprise but the Dem Hollywood types are people you have seen and know...the GOP ones are B list ones who look vaguely familiar but no idea what there names are.Tim Daly, guy from Wings TV show, was a liberal Dem but very classy when confronted by some angry people in a focus group."
5,Wonderful book,"This is a wonderful book that helps reassure children that God is there and always watching over them. The pictures are great and very colorful, my child loves the giraffe and monkeys. :) It is an easy read and the rhyming is great."
1,ALL LIES,"It would have been nice if the product had stated on the box that it would not work on it own if you did not have a Pioneer radio to hook it up to, are a FM converter to make it work."
2,"Rhetoric. Nice Rhetoric, But Still Rhetoric.","I was disappointed with this book. [...]There is nice information included in ""The Taming Of The Chew."" Nice. Like talking to an understanding friend. But this book just isn't useful. If you are serious about ending compulsive eating, don't look for it inside this book.I'm fifty-eight years old and never had a weight problem in my life . . . until two years ago. Suddenly I found myself snacking and cleaning my plate (which I'd never done before). It was making me angry at myself, and left me feeling sick. And I began to gain some weight. Two therapists could not figure out what was going on, so I began reading books on the subject.The best book I've found concerning compulsive and obsessive eating is ""The Hunger Within."" [...]Again, ""The Taming Of The Chew"" is very much like talking to a friend. But if you want quick, real-life help, try ""The Hunger Within."""
2,Not very helpful,"I have suffered from binge eating/compulsive eating for about eight years... I have read a lot of literature, tried a couple apathetic therapists. I realize it is only up to me to really change my attitude, thoughts and of course actions. ANYWAY I purchased this book to help get in touch with my emotional and spiritual reasons for over eating, but it gave me less than satisfactory explanations. ""Don't blame yourself"" general answers, yeah I got that. Nothing to do with actual steps or specific roots to the problem."
2,Definitely should be used for instructional purposes only,"If you're a teacher who likes this as a means to teach your young students to sing along to these classic songs, then this album might be useful to you, but from the standpoint of the average adult-age listener, these are some of the most limp, lifeless renditions of these classic oldies that you'll ever hear, suffering from a severe lack of creativity and sounding more than anything else like the original songs with kids vocals instead of those of the artists who made them famous."
3,Decent Soundtrack,"This soundtrack has some good songs by the Outlawz and a few others, but it also has a few horrible songs by people I Never heard of. Most of the production was handled by QD3. Has a few interviews (2 deep ones with Storm and 2 deep ones with Hussein Fatal and one with Mutulu Shakur). Not really worth buying, just download the few songs that are good.#1 - 8 (Napoleon, Young Noble, Hellraza)#2 - 8.5 (Tru Life, Mack 10, Young Dre)#4 - 7 (Young Dre f/ G Money)#5 - 6.5 (tech N9ne)#7 - 4 (firejack)#9 - 6 (Storm - deep song about her relationship w/ 2Pac)#11 - 1 (horrible song by Kumasi & Hope)#13 - 8(Young Noble, Naploleon, Edi Amin - from 1996)#14 - 6.5 (Mac Mall & Big Syke)#15 - 8.5 (Tru Life, Napoleon, Young Noble)#16 - 5.5 (Ray Luv)#17 - (horrible song by Keplyn)#20 - 3 (Troy Horne f/ Hope)#21 - 7.5 (Stepchyle & Johnny J)#22 - 7.5 (Hussein Fatal, Young Noble, Napoleon, Edi Amin)check all my reviews"
4,"Finally, the complete series","Grailquest may not be the most complex or fairest gamebook series out there, but it's certainly the most entertaining. I enjoyed these books in my lower elementary days and still find them a hoot now.Book 4 was just impossible to find, and I'm happy to finally have it in my collection. It's not the best in the eight, true, but it's still a fun read and won't disappoint Grailquest fans.I got my copy from International Books and am quite pleased with its condition: no dog ears, major creases, or stains."
3,Not bad for quick look at who Mussoilini was,the book is what it is advertized as--a weekend read of benito mussoilini. The author does a nice job of giving the reader a big picture view of the times and reasons for mussoilini's rise to power. I recommend the book to anyone who has never read any history of mussoilini--only heard of his death and being hung in the city square. It gives a nice reference point for conversations on WWII from Italy's perspective.
4,Benito Mussolini,"This was an excellent book for those wanting a concise and relatively short summary of Mussolini's life (1883-1945), nicely framed within the political events of the times. It objectively discusses his strengths and weaknesses, his supporters and foes, his rise to power and his inglorious decline and death. A quick read at 165 pages."
3,"Edgy, different and ineresting.","This is a cool movie that you will want to watch twice maybe to fully ""get"". We enjoyed it alot....but not a favorite."
2,Evil Oil?,"The makers of ""There Will Be Blood"" and ""The Shining"" should sue. This movie is sooo stupid and the lengths that they went to to protray a Texas setting were yee haaaww Down right ridicoulous. Couldn`t stopp myself from failing asleep."
3,A High Price To Be Paid For Oil,"After reading 2 of the 3 reviews I wondered why I was going to bother watching The Damned Thing by the very dissapointing MOH series, but was pleasantly suprised. It wasn't great, but trying to find a great MOH story is like stumbling upon gold. As far as they go it was decent. It was a unique idea that had some good acting but failed to provide a solid ending. You only get to see the creature at the end very briefly then it seems to end before you could really understand what happend. But thats here nor there. It turned out to be pretty enjoyable but is nothing to go crazy for."
3,Body not face,"You can't tell it from the description or the picture, but this is the ""body"" version not the ""face"" version. Since you can't see it, the product description is somewhat unclear and misleading so be forewarned."
1,Many mistakes. Flee.,"I wrote the ""mathematical bolus"" review below and thought I might clarify.Of the five bad reviews, at least one was written by another guy in my class, but I have only written this one and my older one. The other bad reviews could have been other NCSU students. I have no eye deer.The big trouble here is that the book is full of mistakes...solving a second-order differential using the ""division by 2"" method, for example, and the aforementioned self-damping crosswind.If you've got good math skills, lots of patience, and a pre-existing thorough familiarity with analytical mechanics, this might be a pretty good text. If not, get the Thornton book. It's better."
1,"Buy *any* other book but this, I implore you!!","Arya's book is possibly the worst textbook ever written, and the one which I used in my first (non-freshman) mechanics course. I was unfortunate enough to have to pay money for this worthless piece of garbage, and want to prevent others from doing so. I felt guilty at having to sell it back to the bookstore where someone else could buy it, so I threw it into a recycle container instead. In fact, I'm going to beg the physics dept to let me take the grad level course my senior year, just so I can use Goldstein's book instead of this one, even if it means a lot more work--at least I'll learn something!"
1,This is the worst book I ever read,"I have two college degrees and have therefore read my share of text books. Of all of them, this book is by far the worst. The author makes no attempt whatsoever to explain the material in an understandable way. The text is extremely difficult to follow. Worst of all, there are MANY typagraphical errors (usually in the mathematics). On average, I found a math error on every other page. When trying to understand a concept in this book you find yourself wondering if you really don't understand it, or if the author just made another math error. After hours of work, you end up finding that the author just made another math error. This is a miserable excuse for a physics book."
3,Crucidiction,"Each track from this album is powerful and darkly atmospheric; Thomas' vocals are low and haunting as ever but he has improved on he's black vocals sounding more evil and vile.If you do enjoy the ultra slow Gothic and Doom Metal genres, and want some sullen music to feed your melancholy, then ""Crucidiction"" is the what you are looking for."
2,Bars are way too hard,I have had promax products in the past and have enjoyed their soft chewiness. These are more like stale chalk wrapped in chocolate. Good luck eating one without an entire bottle of water.
4,Favorite bar & flavor.,"I have an Amazon subscription to these bars. My second favorite flavor is Nutty Butter Crisp. These bars are great! ... Maybe too great as they are a little like a candy bar. They are satisfying but I get a bit of a ""crash"" later on. They are so good they are addicting."
3,Too chalky,"I like the Promax line, and I love lemon-flavored anything, in general, but I didn't care for these. The lemon flavor was not enough to compensate for the chalky flavor from the soy protein. I'll stick to the Cookies and Cream, the only one that I purchase regularly."
3,Promax Cookies & Cream - Not as Expected,Although I did get the product I ordered I got an older version that differed from what was showed on the site. The old bars have different packaging and contain high fructose corn syrup. The ones that I thought I was going to get do not have high fructose corn syrup in them.
2,Too chewy and sickeningly sweet,"Promax bars are good, but not this one. Try cookies and cream or black forest cake."
4,tasty but chewy,"good taste and texture, but awfully chewy (great jaw workout)...not a good choice for my high school athlete who has braces, loosened band"
4,yummy,"these are a bit higher in sugar then i'd like but they are absolutely fantastic. i bought the German Chocolate and it is like eating a piece of cake, not a protein bar. the taste is smooth and the texture soft. very well worth it."
5,Addictive,"Addictive....is all i can say! Because they are rather large, I usually just eat 1/2 of it and save the rest for later. Or if its a lunch replacement, i eat the entire thing. Its very filling! I also travel with them! Great for when you dont want to stop for fast food!"
3,great product but most of the protein content is from soy,"great product but most of the protein content is from soy, so next time I'll be more watchful and I will choose a bar that contains only whey protein."
3,a little dry,This protein bar is a little dry. Good thing I only bought one box. I prefer the chocolate mint bars Much better! They are not dry at all. I will not purchase this flavor of bars again.
2,Not so great.,I decided to try these after I ran out of builder bars. These are not as good. The price is great but taste is just not there. I wouldn't rather spent a little more.
5,Taste is Excellant,"Protein bar does not taste like the typical vitamin protein bar. Lots of protein and only 300 calories! It tastes really good, almost like a candy bar...I highly recommend them."
5,Best tasting bars I have found,These bars rock. Nutty Butter Crisp is the best tasting flavor of the Promax bars I have found. I just bought 5 boxes through an amazon market seller because amazon doesn't ship them via prime. Get on the ball Amazon. This product is worth stocking.
4,A bulk of protein but hard to chew,Feels like a hard toffee; also not sure if it promotes constipation but it surely doesn't make it easy to digest. Beware of the extra fat and calories they do have an impact so one might need to work harder to break even...It does taste good though unlike some other brands that taste horrible.
3,Too Sweet,"I bought these after trying several other ProMax Protein bars. I generally don't like peanut butter, so try to avoid those flavors and try some other ones and decided to give these a try. They were just too sweet for me, but the nutritional information is good. If you like a really sweet protein bar, this would be the one for you, but it was just too much for me. It also caused me to become very thirsty. If you like lemon and sweet, give these a try. If you're not into very sweet things, I would pass."
5,"Chewy, moist, and delicious.",Once again Promax delivers with a new formula. These bars are delicious. Not too sweet and not too dry. Excellent calorie:protein ratio (280:20)
1,Stale bars - depleted taste.,"When I purchase these bars by Promax in stores they are as good or better tasting than candy bars. Soft and satisfying. Wonderful taste. The bars shipped to me obviously had a low price because they were old and the seller needed to get rid of them. Discolored chocolate covering, HARD as a rock, and much less taste than a fresh product would have. The price was good so I ordered a couple boxes. I HOPED the 2nd box would be different, but nope....just as stale as box number 1."
1,Horrible,This is the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted. It is unpleasantly flavored and chalky. I spit my first bite out and threw the rest in the trash.
5,Absolutely the Best!,"I take this book out only at Christmas (yes, it's my copy). I've run it thru 9 neices and nephews now. They absolutely love it! They ask for it. My one neice memorized every word of it (before she could read it herself). She would recite it with me as I read.This is an adorable little Christmas story with an adorable message for young children. The art is wonderful. And the main character is our good friend, Opus the Penguine"
5,Wonderful for children and adults alike,"This is my favorite of the Breathed series of children's tales. I have a six year old son and this will be my fourth year of being sure this is a part of his Christmas season. As well as, throwing this title in several times throughout the year. A very touching experience to share this story with my son."
5,You gotta have Opus for Christmas.....,"I had to get this book for my grandson. I read this book over and over to his mom, and uncles. I still read it as a grown grandma and still love it. The pictures are absolutely awesome."
5,best children's christmas story,"This is my favorite children's Christmas story! The Opus children's books are all fabulous, and everyone, adults and children both, should read them. All the characters are richly drawn. The books are hilariously funny, yet each one has a strong moral message. In this book, Opus wishes that he could fly like other birds, so asks Santa for wings that work. When Santa's sleigh crashes into the lake on Christmas Eve, Opus ""flies"" through the water and rescues Santa. As his reward for saving Christmas, the snow ducks pick Opus up on Christmas morning and fly him through the air. This book gives a message that each and everyone has his own gift or talent, even though we may not recognize it at first. And it also teaches us that doing good deeds for others reaps its own rewards."
5,Opus Excells,A wonderful and charming Christmas tail told as only Berkeley Breathed could tell it. Excellent for children and adults.
2,Pro-Lite HR-15 Halogen Work Light,"This is a very nice work lamp. However, I haven't been able to find a replacement bulb."
2,down the river,I was disappointed in the fowl language used and God's name so loosely as a cuss word.I would have thought her books would have been more pleasant with the titles. I read 1/3 of the first book and threw away the entire set. Clean it up and it might be good.
4,Down by the River,Another of the Grace Valley books that deal with small town interests and characters that keep you coming back for more.
3,It's okay,Just not enough of interaction between June and Jim. I like to read about the backstory and relationship but didn't find much in this one.
5,Stress Reliever!,"You can always depend on Robyn Carr for a relaxing enjoyable read. She easily makes you feel like a part of the story which results in not wanting to put the book down. Down By the River is just such a book! Please Robyn, we are ready for another series or trilogy."
1,Not worth it,I loved Robyn Carr's virgin river books and have read all of them multiple times and I had hoped that the Grace Valley Trilogy would be just as great. I was wrong. I read maybe the first 100 pages and finally gave up reading it. The characters were not nearly as interesting as other Robyn Carr's books. I found the story to be boring and not nearly interesting enough to keep me interested.
4,grace valley series,"I love this series. The characters are realistic, the stories entirely plausible. Relaxing and thoroughly enjoyable reads. Coming home from work and snuggling down with one of these books is absolute bliss! I can't wait for further additions to this series."
5,Grace River Trilogy,I had read the Virgin River Series First so I knew the characters but not their stories. Robin Carr writes so that you feel like you become a character yourself!
5,"Buy it, buy it, buy it! Best cd you'll own.","This cd is perfect. I first bought it when I was 15 years old and I thought it was a bunch of worthless noise. Then, after about 5 times through the cd, I started to appreciate how different this band is from everything else in the music world. That was 8 years ago.Nowadys, if you know anything about music at all, you'll realize they blow everyone else away. Their lyrics are great, drummer is amazing and if MTV would play music that actually takes talent to write, then Blenderhead would have been as big as Blink 182. Thank God I bought it 8 years ago."
5,Delicious Mango Flavor,It is hard to find this product locally and am thrilled to be able to get it on Amazon. Delicious mango flavor and excellent gelling.
5,Gorgeous Book,"I found this book in the special collection section of the library at VCU, and was very intrigued. It is a wonderful reproduction of a most interesting journal. Even if you don't take into account Dan Eldon's sad ending, this book can be an inspiration for beginning your own journal. His journal is artistic, vague, wild, and engrossing."
5,THE MOST AMAZING BOOK EVER,"This book is amazing. You could look at it over and over again. Each page is put together with so much heart. He uses various media's to capture the mood that radiates from one of his prime sources....photography. I love this book....and hopefully i'll get it for Christmas. (My art teacher has it, and i look at it almost everyday....)"
4,The Journey Is the Destination: The Journals of Dan Eldon,"If you are expecting an extensive journal of his life adventures, you will be disappointed, as I was somewhat. It is more a work of art, a collage or scrapbook of several trips. His writing and handwritten notes are few and short. But, for me, it instantly became an idea of one more way I can remember my 17 year old daughter who died this past August. I had already started putting scrapbooks together, so this book gave me more creative ways to do it! My Juli had also written in a few journals, and now I see a creative way to put pieces of them together as a story of her life with photos, her art work and some memorabilia. Yes, a collage book is developing at my house, but without the expense of publishing it! Creative memories can mean more lasting memories! Thanks for the idea Kathy Eldon!"
4,"Not bad, but Peter Beard did it first.","Dan Eldon's diaries are interesting, and his mother is to be commended for publicizing his work. However, one hopes the photographer/author/artist/adventurer Peter Beard is receiving royalties from this book, since Eldon's diaries are pale imitations of the diaries Beard has been making for decades."
5,Truly Profound,"I bought this book upon it's release in 1997. I can remember allowing the contents of this memoir to captivate me for hours on end. I lent my copy to a friend shortly thereafter and subsequently forgot about it. I recently ordered a replacement and I must say, this book is even more compelling than I ever remembered. Dan Eldon was a profound visionary, an articulate statesman and a devoted caretaker. As a Reuters photo-journalist, he traveled the world and served as a dipomatic embassador to many, yet his life was taken prematurely in a stoning riot in Somalia. He experienced more in his brief 21 years than most of us will over an entire lifetime. A MUST HAVE."
5,Wholly Worthwhile,"This work is beautiful in a way unlike anything else you will ever witness. It is a visual memory of wonders experienced by a young explorer, captured in layers of photographs, paint, stamps, tickets, journal entries, and mementos. It is not a book you can read, but it will take you by the eyes and lead you on a thought-provoking journey.Nothing is going to fall off the pages, don't worry. They are remarkable scans of the original journal pages' texture. The book is an art book, so the pages are heavy and softly glossy. Even the paperback versions are made to last a lifetime. Much more care was devoted to constructing these books than is typical."
4,"Fun, easy read","This book is an alphabetized list of vingnettes that take whimsical look at Verity Bell's love life. It is light and fun in some stories, yet deeply serious and somber in others. I wasn't expecting to get so drawn in because the book is quite a short read, but by the end I was definitely rooting for Verity."
3,Love is Made to be Blind,"The only unique thing about this book is that the subjects are alphabetically ordered. It makes for easier monitoring of when the book is going to finish. A thin volume therefore it is not a heavy read. In fact, it is utterly light in story and in verse. All the short reminiscence is laced with some kind of humor. Some think an affair with a married person is morally wrong and others opine that certain experiences cannot be avoided in life especially when it deals with falling in love. This is a story from the mistress' point of view - her happiness, fears, clumsiness, heartbreak, dreams, imaginations, and defense. No surprises lurk around the corner."
2,Fondue forks not as pictured!,The photo I viewed was of clear non colored plastic fondue forks. Recieved smoked colored clear?? plastic fondue forks. When I contacted store I purchased from I was given a lesson on clear and colorless plastic. Needless to say with high cost of shipping for such a small order will have to use what I got but have planned clear crystal dishes etc for serving I am not real pleased with clear grey colored forks for my celebration table setting.
2,These are no better than regular plastic forks,Read the description carefully. These forks are only 6 inches long and not really true fondue forks. You would be much better off just using an ordinary heavy plastic disposable fork that you can get for a quarter of the price (and no shipping fee) from your local party supply store.
1,Product different than pictured,"I ordered the Mr. Heater MH35LP, but received a slightly different product. The box is labeled Heatstar by Enerco with a part number of HS35LP. It is missing the wheels and upper handle as pictured by Amazon. There is a small sticker placed over the Heatstar label that says MH35LP, but it's clearly a different product and there is no reference to the Mr. Heater brand on the product or documentation.I suspect that the Mr. Heater and the Heatstar brand are manufactured by the same company and may be equally good products. However, I don't support Amazon sending an alternative product without my consent. It's false advertising to say the least.And for those that might be ok without the wheels and the handle, consider that the one I received didn't include the hardware required to install the stand that holds it upright. I can't even use this one."
3,"On a good note, it works",Well I have ran this thing through one tank and I have to say it is okay. It works. The problem with this thing is the coupler it comes with only fits some tanks (it's an internal threaded coupler meant to go inside the tank opening vs. around the outside. Also the designers of this put the cheapest of cheap connectors so it only fits about half the tanks. It doesn't have enought depth in the thread. Also to top it off dear old Amazon offers to sell you a tank level indicator that doesn't fit this as well. Poorly designed coupler took this down a star. It doesn't have an on/off switch but releys on you holding in the button for about a minute to let it completely warm up and then you have to let it cool down and then turn it on again and hope it works. If it's cold outside it can feel like a miserable thousand years. It's cheap and it's what you get.
1,Return to sender?,"I ordered a Mr Heater in December. I received the product no problem. I ordered another in January. When I received it was in a plain box and the main hose plus a screw was missing. We found a screw that would fit and I called Amazon to send the missing part. A very bored man told me to return the product and get a new one. I tried to explain I only needed a part but he did not want to do that. I was very dissatisfied with that response and I will not be buying anything from them in the future.The product is wonderful if you can get it.[ASIN:B0000C6E3B Mr. Heater 35,000 BTU Propane Radiant Heater #F270700]]"
3,"Good Book, Could Have Been Much Better","Good Book, Could Have Been Much BetterThis is a very good book, however it could have been so much better. The photos or images of the patches are very small. It would have been a better effort had the publisher spent the money publishing in a larger format and added more pages so that the the images could have been published at their actual size."
4,A Blessing,"This album is a blessing to all those who listen to the message it is trying to give. The title purpose by design is telling you everything that you are going through has a purpose and it was designed by God. Every song whether slow or fast tells something and is expressing Fred & RFC's love for God for all He has done and is doing. Thank you Fred & RFC for taking gospel music and God's message of love for his children to another level and to different places. Although some may judge this by your earlier works, I will say that I judge it by the message it is trying to get across and if that is successful then it is successful indeed."
1,well,"nothing against the man, but I am not exactly a fan of his music. i like commissioned better. where are they???"
5,this is as good as it gets,"call it a delayed reaction. I've had the pleasure of seeing fred hammond and judge mathis in ''Been There Done That'' over the Summer 2001. By then I had already played out this CD to the point that my family was able to recognize songs as they appeared in the show. ''Give Me a Clean Heart'' is the song for the ages. I normally write on pop icons such as babyface, brian mcknight, and n' sync. Mr. Hammond delivers the spiritual message while gifted with the sweet tenor of the acts just forementioned.Also recommended: cece winans - alibaster box philip bailey - family affair bebe and cece winans - greatest hits"
2,Sorry to break the trend...,"I am a SERIOUS lover of Fred. However, this was not one of his best works. I am literally surprised at him. This album appears to be rushed as a result of the overwhelming response from ""Pages of Life"". The studio work seemed elementary for him. I am extremely hurt because sadly, Fred is the reason why I know and recognize most bible scriptures. Then he comes out with ""In Case you didn't know.."" Yeah, I didn't know that Fred would put out such music. ""More, More, More"" was the best song on that album.Fred Hammond is seriously anointed, but I think he's moving too fast to produce albums."
2,Not impressed,"I have been a Fred Hammond fan from the start, but he has done much better. I'm just being truthful!"
3,PAGES WAS BETTER,"THIS ALBUM WAS OK ITS NO PAGES OF LIFE BUT ITS NOT THE BEST ALBUM FOR FRED. FRED START PUTTING THE CHOIR ON THE COVER, CAUSE EVEN THO U SING THE LEAD, THAT CHOIRS VOCALS ARE TIGHT AND THEY DESERVE PRAISE AS WELL"
5,2nd purchase-very happy,"I ordered this cd for myself more than 6 months ago, it has blessed me greatly. So, I decided to bless a family member with it also. You cant go wrong with Fred Hammond."
1,not a good copy it was scratched up,"not a good copy and I would like a new copy, any suggestions as to what I need to do"
3,Dull Flavor for My Taste Buds,"As a sugar free product, it's pretty solid. However, i was expecting more of a flavor in my morning coffee. perhaps it was the coffee... anyway, I will probably not purchase this flavor again. However, i do recommend many of the other sugar free brands. i do recommend the french vanilla bean syrup if you guys are into vanilla"
5,Anissa Clarks - Great Sandals!!,"The most comfortable shoe I've had in years. I wanted to buy other colors but unfortunately, my size was no longer available. I absolutely love this shoe!"
4,cute and comfy,I really love the look of these sandals and the height is perfect. The heel is sturdy and they are not too tall for walking. I can wear them all day. The heel strap did dig into the back of my heel in the beginning which was pretty uncomfortable. Once the straps were broke-in I haven't had a problem.
4,not their best CD,"This sounds like a Christian version of Minor Threat with the vocalist from Anti. A little goofy, but pretty powerful. Actually, their self-titled CD is aeons better, with an almost speed-metallic hardcore punk version, except their stupid anti-papal song."
4,Enchanting!,"""Faeries,"" by Troika/David Arkenstone is quite a lovely album. Each song is a musical interpertation of various fairy stories from around the world. (a synopsis of each story is included in the liner notes) Countries include China, England, France and Ireland. Most of the album has a definite Celtic flavor to it, featuring the pennywhistle, harp, hammered dulcimer and violin. Other instruments include the Native American flute, Oriental cymbals, tablas, and the oboe.I love the front cover art of this album. That's what made me want to buy it in the first place. That and also the title of it intriqued me. It was another impulse buy. I bought it at a store in Islands of Adventure (Universal Studios) back in 1999, but I can't remember what store. The artwork on the liner notes is just as entralling. One more piece of info: both the artwork and text for the stories are taken from The Book of Fairies-Nature Spirts from Around the World retold by Rose Williams."
4,Faeries:A Realm of Magic and Enchantment,This is a very relaxing CD. It has a sense of the supernatural when you listen to it. It will transport you to the world of Elves and Faeries as you relax and enjoy each song. Reccomended for all folks that need to slow down their busy lives.
4,Not what I expected,"I don't see faeries when I listen to this, but it's pretty and relaxing and that's all I am usually looking for when I play it. Check out the other Troika cd's too."
2,"Good Picture, Noisy, Bad Interface","I bought this monitor in 2003. The picture is fine but the monitor has a high pitched whine. This sound is very irritating and I find that after so long it's affecting my hearing. The controls are hard to see, especially in low lighting, and there are 8 buttons that all look the same so you have to go through a process of trial and error to adjust it every time. If you just care about the video quality though, this is ok for that. As for me, I'm looking now for something that makes little to no noise and I would suggest you look for something that doesn't make this noise."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,This item WILL NOT WORK WITH IPOD VIDEO!! Nowhere in the description does it mention this. Please do not order this and save your money.
2,"Limited range, several issues","I paid about $12 + shipping for this at CompUSA. Net $18 or so. It's probably worth about $10 total.I get about an 8 foot line of sight range. The Griffin FAQ on this mentions two issues: RF interference with 433.92 MHz devices (common in home security systems and some phones) and battery issues. They suggest testing the range away from interference and then swapping battery.I tested away from interference and got the same results. Then I took it apart (it's not designed to be opened) and found the battery was cemented in.I called tech support and got a message they were in a meeting. I tried submitting an online message and got a 'server malfunction' error from their server.I'd recommend this device for use in automobiles and motorbikes. It would also work on a bike, but riding a bike with impaired hearing is illegal in some states (and should probably be illegal everywhere)."
4,Great Buy,"I needed something to let me bury my ipod in my coat pocket during the winter months while still having control over song selection and volume.With the AirClick, I can leave the Ipod protected and conveniently pull out the remote without taking off my gloves to adjust my listening.You can't switch from playlists to songs... but for the price, this is worth it."
1,Disappointed,My husband couldn't get the thing to work. Try another brand if you need this kind of product.
1,Absolute garbage,"This thing worked fine - in a distance of 2 inches to the device. And if it wassn't ridiculous i'd say it needs a line of sight.The product design is very nice. It's a pitty that it simply does't work, even after I replaced the battery."
2,Not a great product for household use,"I purchased this remote / receiver combo yesterday at the Apple store. I really wanted to be able to control my iPod from another room, the deck, etc. I use my iPod mainly as a jukebox on my home stereo, and have speakers in rooms other than the one where the system is.The AirClick system sounded like a good idea. The advertising boasts ""control your iPod from any room in the house!"". Since it uses RF (instead of Infrared (line of sight)) control, it theoretically work through walls, cabinets, etc.Well, the unit does work pretty well if you're in the same room as the ipod / receiver. However, just 15' away in the next room, nothing. It just didn't work.Needless to say, I returned it.I do give it 2 stars, however, because it would probably be useful in the car or in an apartment / dorm room (somewhere small)."
1,Does not actually work without ordering adding a docking connector,"This device requires you to order another item, a docking connector in order for it to function. It does not say this in the description. I unfortunately did not read the unfavorable reviews. A complete ripoff! Too bad because this device is exactly what I need otherwise."
2,Short distance remote.,"The remote works quite well and is easy to use. BUT, I'm getting a range of 8-9 feet with no barriers, less with physical barriers. I haven't used it much because of this."
4,Good Value,"The performance was slow to react and distance was about four feet.I called tech support, no help. I decided to replace the battery, a $3.50 additional expense, but it works great.Plan on buying a replacement battery if you order one."
3,Works but could do better,"The remote does not control all functions, only play/pause, fwd, back, and stop it also can turn the ipod on and off and has a hold setting. You are unable to use it to switch out of albums so if you are using it in a car you need to create some playlists before hand so that you can just skip through songs. Other than that there are no real complaints it works fine, just know before hand what you want to use it for."
1,"Didn't work as advertised, poor customer service","I ordered the Griffin AirClick Remote Control for iPod so that we could control my wife's (then fiancees') iPod during our small wedding. The advertisement stated the unit would work ""through walls"" and from ""up to sixty feet away"". My fiancee bought one, based on the several (mysterious?) positive reviews here. The device she bought only worked from about three feet away, and then only sporadically. We changed the battery. Same effect. We thought we might have gotten a defective unit, so, in the time crunch before the wedding, I bought another one in the hope we could get a working unit in time for the wedding and return the defective one later.The second unit behaved exactly like the first one. Even worse actually. I contacted the seller (Apex Suppliers) and received a returned the item. I still have not received a refund or a reply to my emails. Beware of this seller."
3,A useful read,"Parsons' book contains useful information about publishing, but Parsons wrote the book as more of a journalistic study of the publishing process and how it works. (From what Parsons says, he wrote the book as his PhD dissertation for his terminal degree in journalism.) In other words, there is very little advice. The book does contain useful information, but I'd recommend William Germano's _Getting It Published_ instead."
3,Almost great,The diameter fits very well...however the depth was a little too small. Barely covers the tread(one moe inch and it would have been 5 stars).Seems to be of decent quality for the price.
4,Doesn't enclose the backside much,"Cover works great, only problem was the back side was not enclosed as much as I was hopeing for. I used it on a B78-13"
4,"The ""Quiet"" Bronte Finds Her Voice","Dear Mr. Chitham,I do not know whether you are among the living, or not. I am writing my praise in a public forum because it must be said. Somehow, despite a dearth of letters and surviving diary papers, you have written a masterful biography of the ""baby"" of the Brontes.It is difficult, if not impossible, to extract Anne's story from the accounts of other people, especially Charlotte's best friend and her biographer. In the traditional portait, Anne is the ""sweet"" and ""gentle"" sister of three high-strung and tempramental Romantics. In your book, you examine the sources and and refute the mistaken impressions to reveal a rich imagination, a deep and sincere faith, a bright and observant wit, and a heart that survived loss and disappointment. Anne Bronte lived her life to the tempo of different music.Thank You."
2,"Deceiving image, brass, not bronze finish","Image looked like it could have been the bronze finish. Since I couldn't find the finish in the description, I took the chance and ordered it. Needs to specify clearly in the description or title what finish this product is. Now I'll have to bronze it with spray paint."
4,Really does the job,"I bought this remote for an unbeatable 6$. It's not a full multimedia remote, but it does the job. Play, pause, FF, REW, volume up and down. Plus, it works with Keynote and PowerPoint (use the updated software from Griffin website, not the one included on the CD!!!). You can also manually program the remote to work with any software.The remote itself feel very flimsy and I suspect it won't survive me sitting on it by mistake. Hopefully I can afford another 6$ if that ever happens."
4,"Great, but flimsy","I had one of these in my pocket a few months back and the USB end of the receiver snapped off, rendering the device useless. However, when they aren't breaking (why might just have been a fluke), they're really useful. I use one to control the music for a dance class I teach, and another one I have hooked up to my computer at home: and the range of these things is fairly impressive. It'll go through one or two walls, as long as there's not a large metal object between you two."
3,It's Good not Great,I think it does a good job not the greatest. Sometimes the buttons work and sometimes they don't. I use it to help DJ solo at parties and so far it reliable most of the time.
