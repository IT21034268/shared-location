5,The Best And Most Wylde Wylde.,"Well its not really very wild. But this moslty accoustic album *IS* very good. I heard it for the first time at a wedding reception type thing we had last weekend. I was sort of in charge of the tunes and my cousin brought this album and we played it. It was really good and I liked it enough to want to buy it. If you like hard rock and accoustic guitars and a telented musician talented enough to be successful away from an aging rock star, then get this."
5,A lucid 2/1 approach,I like the very direct way of pointing the value of strategies. The quizzes make the sections interesting. And the quizzes are set up in a useful way.
2,Poor Examples,"This book covers many basic Bridge topics related to 2/1. It is well indexed and organized. Unfortunately, many examples are not well selected and demonstrate the author's non standard slant to standard bidding. I would not recommend this book to intermediate players."
3,It works.... Kinda,These work but only if you use all four of them on a single corner. Otherwise they just scoot their butts over the wire.
2,not worth the money,"this product isn't worth purchasing. my ferrets take no notice of them, going right over and under them to use the corners or right up against it. not a deterrent at all."
4,The Art of Shapes,"The shapes described in the book are basic shapes such as the star, heart, square, etc... but also some interesting shapes such as octagon, cylinder etc.. they are taken from the actual artwork and put into shape form. For example, Ellsworth Kelly: Colors for a large wall takes a blue square from his artwork.The book is simply stated. It shows the artwork and describes it in a little caption and on another page it shows the shape. It's an interesting take on teaching children their shapes as well as art that is not from more familiar artists like matisse and picasso.I think these books make great pieces to show off in a modern style toddler room or even to keep out on the coffee table.P.S. My daughter enjoyed turning each page learning abput each shape. The book is also just her size. A typical childrens board book size 5x5?"
1,Need to know what shapes are in it!,Don't have for a review for this yet but would love to know what shapes are in it.
2,Low quality board book - a bit disappointed,Was excited to find this book and give to my nephew but the board is really thin and cheap. I have an 8 mos. old now and know how important it is for the board books to be tough and sturdy. The text and pictures themselves are fine.
2,I wish I could see the characters on bed sleeping,"I'm disappointed with the book. It's cute but I think it's missing the most important point, when the characters are sleepy in bed. There is no illustration of them in bed. That would have helped my kid to visualize what you do after say ""good night."""
4,Nice book,"I love the book, I have the English version which is adorable so I wanted the Spanish version as well. The translation is acceptable."
1,"Pretty Pictures, Poor Translation","I did read the previous reviews on the book's poor translations, yet I never imagined they would be so bad! How can publishing houses do this?? The pictures and the characters are fun, yet if you are a native Spanish Speaker, this book will hurt your eyes, and you will end up making up better translations as you go along. The pictures are fun, and the story is relevant for children as they prepared to go to bed, but other than that...I agree, you are better off buying the English language version!"
3,Ok,A mi hija le gustó pero siento que hay vacíos de fondo en este libro. Sin embargo le doy 3 estrellitas
4,New Orleans then and now,"Great book in great condition. I live about 100 miles from New Orleans and frequent the city often. I love the culture and the historic buildings. This book has photos of the many of the buildings that have become familiar to me in my visits. Not only are there pictures but the history of the buildings as well. I always wondered, now my questions are answered. Can't beat the price either."
2,Not ideal,"These keyboards are a little rough mechanically. If you get one and it does not work right, do not communicate via the vendor's website. Go via Amazon. That way you will be one step closer to resolution if the vendor does not understand your problem. I would have returned this item I got because it had a ""sticking"" key, but I figured that by the time I paid shipping it would be worthwhile to gamble with fixing it myself. If you phone Ergogeek, be sure to write down the name of the person you spoke to, the date and time of the call, etc.The trackball is not easy to use because the ""mouse"" part is on the right corner, but the ""left button"" and ""right button"" are on the left corner. So to do anything useful you must use both hands.If you do not need the size and shape then a quick trip to Staples for a cheap keyboard and a cheap mouse might be better."
2,Not what is seen on shop floor,"On the shop floor this TV was looking great. It was playing ""Kungfu Panda"" DVD movie. This movie is bright with many white spaces. So, the picture looked stunning. Don't let the shop floor display fool you!!But later at home when you watch movies with dark scenes and dimly lit scenes, this TV totally sucks. It was so bad that I regretted buying this TV. I wanted to change the HDMI cable also thinking that it might not be carrying all the signals to the screen....but it was useless.Samsung offers great price/value. Sony is bit more expensive!! But it would be worth the higher prices you pay than to have a problem TV in your hand and trying all the remedial measures to improve the performance and display of the TV."
3,It's an ok picture but it will go bad after the warranty,It's good picture but it will go bad after the warranty. Many people had problems with this tv 1-2 years after purchase. I know I did. Still have it though and am currently trying to get it fixed. This is now an old model so a review at this point is actually futile.
2,Read the specs carefully,"Beware the fine print. I purchased a Philips 47"" LCD (different model number, from another vendor) that was trumpeted as ""Full HD - 1080p"" on the box in 3"" lettering and all the literature. When I got it home, there was an asterisk on the spec sheet INSIDE the box. After an hour of online research and a call to Philips tech support, they finally confirmed that the display panel was 1080p, but the system would only accept a 1080i signal. Although all LCDs are inherently progressive scan (the ""p""), the unit I purchased was not capable of displaying any 1080p content because the signal path to the display can't handle it. The picture is lovely with other content, but it won't do what is claims. It went back to the vendor.Before you buy this unit or any Philips LCD, make sure you get explicit confirmation that all the links in the signal chain can really do what the marketeers promise."
5,it's AWESOME !!,"this CD is one of the best. whether or not you want to jam or chill out and dream, this is the CD for you...it's jazz with all the right emotion."
3,"New Singer, New Flavor","Even though frontwoman N'Dea Davenport is missing, Siedah Garrett surprisingly pulls the album together with her own brand of personality and delivery. Garrett's more booming voice lacks the urgency and yearning that Davenport's liquid smooth vocals imparted, but it does add a different dimension to the Heavies' sound. The Brand New Heavies still know how to churn out thick grooves laden with lots of funk and soul, and though I was resistant to the idea of a Heavies album without N'Dea, I warmed up to this new direction after a few listens. Great album to listen to, but make sure you check out the earlier material too."
5,Essential Album,"This is definitely one of the best (if not the BEST) BNH Cds out there. If you like bass-, piano- and horns-driven funk, then this is the Cd for you. I assure you, you will not be disappointed by this Cd. It easily has 11 tracks that are worthy of constant rotation. If you are even remotely contemplating purchasing this disk, just do it. It's tight."
3,Don't buy this book for concepts on EJB ...,The book goes into great details of OTS. The topic on EJB is too shallow and doesn't even scratch the surface.This is a good book for OTS hence the 3 stars.I must admit that I learned a lot about transaction management from this bookThis is also a mouth piece for Inprise products. The authors only talk about the Inprise implementation as if they are the only true implementors!
1,This book is not about EJB,"This book is not about EJB or JTS. It is about OTS, and the rest was thrown into the title for buzzword effect."
5,Great Story,I love the No Other Series and was excited to be able to get all three for Kindle so I could read them again. Great romance and Shannon Drake can keep your interest with a wonderful sensitive story about the treatment of Native People and their struggles to maintain their way of life. I am glad she chose to portray the true story of the battle at Little Big Horn.
2,Not as good as the No Other series,I enjoyed No Other Man and No Other Woman more than I did No Other Love. Most disappointed.
5,A Private Eye Looks at 50,"I ordered Black Hornet and Moth after reading Cypress Grove and Drive. What I didn't realize at the time was that I would be reading bookends of the career of Lew Griffin, an accidental private eye fumbling foward into maturity without an immediate need to know why doing what seems right is improbably its own reward.And the writing. This is the reward. There is the plot. There are the characters. And there are the sentences.This book is about Lew Griffen taking stock and making sense of what took him from the Black Hornet to 50 as an adjunct professor in French literature who still finds himself the moth drawn to the flame.The man understands how to break a jaw, remembers the difference between drinking and drinking, mixes in the difference between French and Amaerican fiction, and, finally accepts that being alone is neither noble nor romantic, although ineveitable, all while not resorting to a single cliche or allowing tedium to cause a page to be turned."
5,"Great dishes. Sturdy, durable and handsome stoneware and passes California prop 65 for safety.","Great dishes. Sturdy, durable and handsome stoneware and passes california prop 65 for safety"
3,Heat Pad,I purchased this product for my Mother and she said to me that it relieves her pain tremendously.
1,Poorly formatted,"The information is interesting but the poor formatting makes for a joyless read.I hadn't realized that this book is available for free at history.nasa.gov, where it is better formatted, properly organized, and actually includes the illustrations.Honestly, it looks like someone ran an html conversion tool on the web pages and didn't even bother to verify that it did a decent job."
1,"Lack of TOC, format problems","Despite the price, this ebook has a lot of format problems, line breaks and strange numbers between text ando so."
4,Good product,"Strong and very useful for 16"" cake! Much stronger than cardboard for heavy cakes. Great, hard to find product. Recommend."
1,Arrived Filthy,"This product arrived obviously used, worn, and filthy. Luckily I was using it for a purpose other than food. Very disappointing."
5,Smooth and delicious,"This sugar-free dark chocolate is smooth and silky. With ust the right sweetness, it is delicious, and very reasonably priced."
5,Solving mathematical problems with imagination,"A very entertaining novel, with a collection of mathematical problems embedded, that are solved with ingenuity rather than elaborate mathematical equations. A must read for all ages."
3,okay,This book is an ok read. It is difficult to get into and can be hard to follow. Would be good for higher level students.
5,Must read,"This booke is a excelent source of entreteriment, matematical curiosities and knologe! I a must for everyone..."
3,"Good Book, but Not for School Use","I enjoyed reading this book, but would not use it in my middle-school classroom because of the overt religion in it, and the lack of cohesion for specific subjects. I guess I was just expecting something different."
2,For math aficionados only,"My 9 year old has great marks in math, but neither she nor I got much past the first chapter. The writing is complex and the stories of interest only to those who love number puzzles. My 13 year old boy was far more interested in this book. If your child is younger and they aren't fascinated by numerical puzzles, give it a miss."
5,The *Real* Deal!,"To put this simply, The Groove Hogs are THE *REAL* DEAL!! Here's a great live band that has developed into a world class studio band as well. Combining various portions of Tower Of Power, Edgar Winter's White Trash and Roomful Of Blues they retain the ability to add a personal stamp that is all their own. These guys can rock hard enough for virtually anyone, just take a listen to ""Blues Is My Business""......one of the *best* opening tracks I've heard in recent memory. If you want to hear the best Tower Of Power song they never wrote give a listen to ""Positive Trip"". The Groove Hogs have it all! GET THEIR CD'S AND AMAZE YOURSELF AND YOUR FRIENDS!!"
5,Rapid 4,"FINALLY, a game which you can play with your children and your grandchildren and everyone has a blast. It was absolutely wonderful. We can't wait until holidays when grandkids are here again; it was lively and lots of laughs. And the kids can win easily!!"
4,Fast-moving fun,"Always searching for new and different gifts for our pre-teen grandchildren, and this one fit the bill perfectly. Fast-paced fun to pass the time and keep them occupied during those after-school hours."
5,"A worthy follow up to ""Fool on the Hill""","Sergio's follow-up album to his monster ""Fool on the Hill"" album finds the band in equally fine form, continuing to spin its magic touch on unexpected material like ""Dock of the Bay"" and ""You Stepped Out of a Dream."" The album's flower power is in full bloom in the delicious ""Pretty World,"" a huge adult contemporary hit which almost (but not quite) made the Top 40 in the summer of '69. Lani Hall really steps into the limelight more forcefully than ever on this album, not only in her stellar vocal turns on ""Dock of the Bay"" and ""Song of No Regrets,"" but also as co-writer of several of the songs. The album's closer, ""Crystal Illusions,"" finds Sergio working in a quasi-psychedelic environment that features a Stravinsky-inspired orchestration by Dave Grusin. This is classic Sergio from the height of his creative powers."
2,A different viewpoint,"After reading the reviews, I expected a lot, and I did not get it. This vacuum is heavy and awkward to hold. The dust cup is really tiny and needs to be emptied very often. What I find most annoying about this vacuum is the FILTER, which gets dirty almost instantly, and it is a very nasty job trying to get the dust and dirt off of the filter in order to restore suction. The accompaning extension is too short and looses suction. I had hoped to use this around the house in places that my standard vacuum would be too bulky for, but the Scorpion will not fill that niche for me."
4,Not bad,"It has a lot of suction, but the wide attachment is a poor design. Hardly any use. I cut off the nylon bristles and it works better, but should have been better designed. Other than that, it works well if you don't mind having to do a 1.5 inch strip at a time."
4,Nice but,Nice suction but the hole is narrow and on an angle so you have to tilt it almost flat to not block the suction while vacuuming. (a pain in the back) And not crazy about the flip down nozzle. Nice idea but a bit flimsy.
4,Strong/Loud Suction,"This little vac is very loud, but has incredible suction! It sucked up things that I didn't even mean to suck up, that I thought were too large...but up it went. The only inconvenience, other than how loud it is, is the cord, of course....and the plug seems to have a difficult time fitting into outlets.... but, really a great vac for the price."
4,So much power in such a little package!!,"I'm in love, we bought this little machine to clean the edges of our carpeted areas since our upright doesn't have a hose attatchment. I couldn't wait to use it once it arrived. I cleaned the whole house just to find some new places to use it. When you switch it on make sure to hold on tight because this little guy will take you for a ride. It cleans corners, ceilings, baseboards, vehicles and I'm sure more. I can't wait to find some new uses for it."
1,Too Loud,This thing is way too loud and the exhaust fan blows too much.....it makes it too hard to clean.
3,It Has A Punch!,"This is a very handy compact corded vacuum. The suction is very strong, but it is noisy."
2,POWERFUL BUT VERY HEAVY,"This little vacuum is powerful but very heavy. The little clip that holds the flip down nozzle broke off and I have only used the stupid thing once. The broken clip is really what irritates me the most. I attribute the power to the fact that the vacuum is electric but, of course, you have to be close to your power source or use a long extension cord. The dirt cup is very small. Considering how much it can pick up, the use of electric and an extension cord, I think it really isn't worth the financial investment or the trouble. The car wash vacuum or a standard vacuum cleaner would suffice."
4,Powerful!,"This little vacuum works very hard! It is easy to empty out the debris. The only cons are that I wish the cord was longer and that the little flip thingy in the front does not seem to be very effective. Other than that, a great hand held vac!"
4,"Powerful, not enough attachments","This is a powerful little hand vacuum but there are not enough attachments and options for use. I mainly use it to sweep up kitty litter aound the cat boxes and the fine powder goes right through the filter and out the exaust. With the one attachment it does come with the brush it won't pick up kitty litter, poor design rather than lack of power I believe who knows."
3,Worked great at first....,"So this was great when I first got it. It picked up things off my rug super fast, including hair and lint. However, after a while, I started noticing hair coming out of the vents on the side. The filter should have prevented anything from moving past it and coming out of the air vents. However, when I opened it up, I saw that the filter was correctly in place. I'm not sure how the hair and lint got through the filter, but they did. Also, the filter needs to be changed very quickly (in about 3-4 15-minute uses), which I find to be annoying.The quick flip attachment also was not that useful. It's angled in a weird way where I found it difficult to pick things up. Lastly, this vaccum is HEAVY, which makes it hard to crawl/squat around your room trying to clean things while carrying it."
5,Great Handheld Vacuum!,"I am very happy with my Dirt Devil Scorpion purchase. I was looking for a handheld vacuum that could quickly pick up cat hair around the house (including the couch and desk chairs) without having to pull out my big vacuum. This vacuum is just what I needed and it is extremely powerful. It has no problem sucking up the dirt you are looking to eliminate. I use it every other day because it is so handy. I have also found the brush insert to be beneficial in getting hair off of chairs, our comforter and couch. The extender that flips out is so handy for getting into little crevices and cob webs in the corner of the ceiling. The best part about it is that you can flip the extender out while you're vacuuming without having to stop the vacuum and insert it. The only downside I have found is the filter. The filter is made of a soft material so it is hard to get the dirt off of it. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this handheld vacuum."
2,"Not Cordless, attachments dont fit","There was a picture and description of the vacuum sitting in a base for charging, but this one has a cord on it . . . and not a very long one at that.Where is my cordless vacuum ?Also, the attachments that came with the three pack (along with the filters) DO NOT fit this vacuum !Perhaps they fit the cordless one . . ."
2,BEWARE!!,"I have had Dirt Devil handhelds for years.I bought the ""quick"" flip model last year #0882 locally.Although Dirt Devil handhelds have the best battery life and suction the quick flip tool is deplorable. It is anything BUT quick!It sticks and the joint at the flip point is made poorly. It broke in under a year and I am VERY gentle with anything I own.Also the base unit is a snap in one. If you have it wall mounted or NOT it is also awkward to handle.Good idea but bad execution!So sad since Dirt Devil has always been a superior product :( Now I have to go look for another company to purchase from.It will NOT be Dustbuster since their suction is poor and battery also."
2,Sound Like It Has LOTS of Power,"I purchased the Dirt Devil Scorpion to clean edges on my staircase and to clean up spilled kitty litter and cat food. I decided on the Dirt Devil product as I have a vacuum that, while loud, works wonderfully.The Scorpion is a very loud little unit and, it seems to have decent suction provided you aren't using the brush attachment (there is no suction with the brush attachment). Unfortunately, the suction only seems to work with the flat attachment which has a tendency to suction-cup itself into place on floors and walls. If you are vacuuming something like small pieces of catfood, the pieces will eventually go into the unit but, only if you lift the hose above it so gravity lends a hand.My biggest complaint is the wind generated. It blows everything you are trying to clean up all around the room! It defeats the purpose of trying to use it. It is easier to lug out the upright, full size vacuum for cleaning small jobs that to even consider using this."
1,Terrible vacuum,"I bought this to use as a car vacuum. It has terrible power when you add the accessories. In order to get in those hard to reach spots between the seats, you need the accessories... the only problem is when you add the it to the vacuum, it takes away any power it has. I returned it right after I tried it."
4,great little vacuum,"ProsThis is an extremely powerful vacuum cleaner, especially for its size. Its size and various attachments allow it to clean almost anywhere. The long cord gives it a long reach.ConsThat powerful motor makes a lot of noise, but most vacuum cleaners do anyway. The picture shows it is black, but I received the trademark Dirt Devil red color. Power cord is not retractable; this may be an issue for some people. I don't mind.ConclusionIf you want a full size vacuum cleaner's capability in hand held size, then this is for you."
3,Sucks Good,A little on the heavy side but that's what the shoulder strap is for. The little snout that flips out is pretty useful too.
2,Filter clogs up,"It has lots of power, but all you get done , is emptying the filter. 5 minites then empty.If you don't, it looses it power.I would not buy another."
3,Basic Needs met,"It is a basic handbook for Technicians there some interesting tidbits and tables but not enough details oriented for my personal/research use in GC/MS Referencing or solvent compatibilities. Needs up to date reference tables for water, waste water pollution sampling and preservation techniques."
4,Best thing I've found about succeeding on eBay . . .,"I've been a small-time bookseller on eBay since shortly after it started up, and it took awhile to figure out just what I was doing. I wish this book had been available then! Actually, it's become more difficult -- not easier -- ... ... Miller does a good job of explaining the best way to approach things, dealing with the eBay Establishment, handling deadbeats and frauds (buyers *and* sellers), playing the feedback game, and trying to decide if you can actually make a living from this thing. (Probably not for most booksellers, not without a real-world location to work from.) The chapter of shipping tips is especially worth reading. Of the half-dozen recent books about eBay I've read recently, this is probably the best."
4,the best of the bunch,I have a few books on ebay and this one is the easiest most user friendly book i have encountered. Love the cartoons and the bit of tongue-in-cheek fun along the way. It is well organized and actually fun to read.
5,Great,"I use this for work. It is awesome, well made, and keep me warm. My only problem was finding the right size. Carhartt runs odd for me. I went to a store and tried one on and then ordered online because it was 5 bucks cheaper and i got 2 day shipping w my prime."
5,"Quality, Fit & Function","Made well and excellent fit, true to size. Nice weight for in between a regular sweatshirt and a heavy coat."
5,Great gift for my Son-In-Law.,This made the perfect gift for my son-in-law. As a Electrician he never knows where the next job will take him. A lot of times he is in a new building with no heat doing the wiring. He loves it!!!!
5,Awesome Sweatshirt,Got this for my Son for his birthday.. it's well made .. the thermal lined is extremely warm.. face it kids just dont wear jackets anymore it's all about the hoodies...
3,Not long enough,"I bought this thermal lined sweatshirt because it came in a tall. When the sweatshirt arrive it was very short, and I had to return it."
4,Carhartt thermal hoodie,Came as advertised and quickly! Hoodie fits great. Material feels heavy duty and I think it will last through repeated washings.
5,Excellent purchase,"Over the past few years I have purchased other sweatshirt jackets for my husband. Even though they were listed as better quality items (and the cost reflected this) they did not hold up at all. They had poor quality material (early signs of wear, shrinking), zippers that didn't last and they just plain looked frumpy shortly after the purchase. The Carhartt jacket is obviously better material and better quality workmanship. We have only had it a month but he has worn it a lot and it looks like it will be a keeper. The length and size are what they should be for a big/tall jacket and it looks good (bonus)."
5,great addition to your Bob the builder collection,"This one has largely positive stories with Wendy solving problems and in charge while Bob is sick/busy etc. The stories that involve fixing a tennis court, soccer field, etc are a great deal of fun for my 2 1/2 year old son. Very sweet, and nice to see Wendy as a capable and equal partner in Bob's business."
5,Showcasing Wendy!,"I bought this DVD for my two year old girl. I am the ""Mrs. FixIt"" in my home and I wanted to expose my little girl to female characters with a can-do attitude. There are lots of great shows for kids but I notice the fun ones (to me) mostly showcase male characters. This episode collection meets my needs as each episode showcases Wendy saving the day or being an invaluable helper for Bob the builder. Its a great addition to any ""Bob The Builder"" DVD collection.Lets face it, there may never be a ""Wendy the Builder"", not while society pushes girls into tiaras. That said special collections like this help parents expose kids to a more level representation of the world & women."
3,BOB THE BUILDER,"I COULDN'T BELIEVE THE AMOUNT OF ADVERTISING ON THE DVD!! TARGETTING 2 YR.OLDS IS BEYOND LIMITS, I FEEL!!"
3,Contents,"Just thought I would post a much-needed table of contents to inform those curious. This e-volume contains:Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of RightOn the Jewish QuestionOn the King of Prussia and Social ReformMoralizing Criticism and Critical Morality: A Polemic Against Karl HeinzenProudhonFrench MaterialismThe English RevolutionThe translation is not good at all, but at least it has a linkable ToC"
1,Skip it,"I bought this book for my daughter during the period when I thought she liked these girls. The more of these books she read, the more she became convinced that she was wasting her time with nonsense. Buy your daughter real classics and good literature. Skip this mass culture madness and stay away from these poorly written vehicles to benefit the careers of these two girls with so little talent."
5,My favorite video of all time....Robin Hood lives!!!,I love reggae and several visits to Jamaica proved that the Jamaicans are incredibly resourceful and courageous people. I saw the movie in San Francisco over and over again. I got married and moved back to N.C. I asked for the video for Christmas before the days of amazon.com. My husband had it shipped in from New York. It is my very favorite video. Watch this movie and you will never complain about paying taxes again!!!
5,Best of the Best,"Very enjoyable movie. The music was authentic, the characters were actual reggae stars and the ""Robin Hood"" theme went over well.Favorite scene: When the lead character was vexed about his motorbike being stolen and he went to his friend. He and his friend went, walked, and sat by the river and his friend sang a song that calmed the lead character's spirits. That is the most beautiful scene I have ever, ever seen in any movie. It showed true, true friendship."
4,Rockers,The movie was very entertaining and I loved the soundtrack! The cameo appearances by the artists themselves was a bonus!
5,"Super simple, quality game!","This must by the simplest word game that exists...it almost sounds stupid it's so simple, but it's excellent. Gamers will be surprised that this is by the world-famous designer Reiner Knizia. You gotta love a game that works great for a bunch of kids just starting to read and for some hardcore word-gamers."
5,Great game for all ages!,This game is great! It is a great way to get kids to learn to spell etc! We have had so much fun playing with friends and family of all ages!
2,Lulu's Provencal Table,"I had been searching for this book and finally found at US bookstore ""uniquebooksplus"".The content is pure Olney. Divine.How very disappointing to receive it smelling so horribly 'MUSTY'. Obviously came from a storage space (of many years). And a damp one.Hardly inspiring when I open the book wanting to cook something delicious!Too bad. Unique books should have mentioned this."
5,Jim (Atlanta),"This album captures the essence of Tracy Lawrence. Long out of country limelight, we oft forget that he was one of the big stars of the early 90s with over 20 number #1 hits. Paint me a Birmingham and Alibi are two of the true classics in country music ... the other songs on this album are a great compilation of his hits and remind us of this singer's incredible voice and magnatism. If you've never heard of Tracy Lawrence or if you've put him on the backburner due to his absence the last 10 years, this album will turn you into an avid fan! His recent hit ""Find out who your friends are"" gives me hope that he's back for good. Lets keep our fingers crossed.JimAtlanta"
3,"Great CD, A re-recording notice woulda been nice though.","I have to give this CD 3 stars only because there was no notice anywhere on the CD cover mentioning that this CD contains new recordings of his old songs instead of being a true ""Greatest Hits"" collection CD. In fact, the sticker on the cover leads you to believe otherwise. None-the-less, the recordings are extremely close to the originals and he does include the original ""Paint Me A Birmingham"" which makes it an ok buy."
4,i don't get these other reviews...,I think this was a great book. this is one of the on;y book on eating disorders that i feel relates to me. i thought just like her. and it hurts to see others write such bad reviews. this was a real person telling her real story! this book really moved me. i hope people do read this book and don't listen to people who call this surviver lame.
1,I didn't like this book at all.,"This author leaves so many unanswered questions. The cover should have had a picture of Fabio on it, and Barbara Cartland co-author it - the heroine got her man! I have suffered from an eating disorder for almost 20 years, and my therapist recommended it to me. Sure it is comforting to know that there are others who feel the way I do, but just because one suffers from an eating disorder does not automatically mean that one should write a book about it. It certainly didn't give me any insight into my illness, nor did it provide me with any hope."
1,Do not read this book!,"I have read numberous books on eating disorders, from clinical manuals to personal accounts - this book is up there with the worst of them. I forced myself to finish reading it because I couldn't believe how bad it was. Poor grammar, and an author who continually cried ""woah is me"" was bad enough but for anyone who struggles with an eating disorder this book is very triggering. I understand personal accounts of eating disorders can be triggering, but this was a long, drawn out self-pity waste of time. As a recovering anorexic I felt that this book did not portray the personal struggles of eating disorders accurately at all.I give the author credit for telling her story, as it is a very difficult thing to do. I hesitated to write a review because I did not want to offend the author, but truthfully her editors should have played a more integral role in her book."
2,somewhat accurate but terribly written,"I find myself cringing at her style of writing. She makes it seem like an after school special by confusing hindsight with her actual thoughts at the time. Any firsthand accounts are helpful, but the book often seems contrived and made up. I know her pain all too well, but that doesn't mean that she can write."
1,Bad one,"This book was awful. THe author is a bad writer in general. Also, as you can tell from her scary emaciated grin on the back of the book, she is NOT recovered. This means that she cannot distance herself from her disorders and therefore can't really write about them well. There is a tinge of smugness in her account, like, ""Look how thin I am, I just CAN'T eat."" It's boring and it's about a really lame person...she is incapable of living her life at all. She still lived with her parents for the majority of her life."
1,Don't bother....,"...with this one. I have read many books in an attempt to understand eating disorders, and this one is not worth the time or money. The prose is terribly facile and amaturish, and the 'insights' in the book are so immature that you might think it was written by a ten year old. Although I respect her experience, it's important to note that going through a difficult experience doesn't necessarily qualify you to write about it."
1,Yaaaaaawwwwnnnn.,"Yet another book glorifying the silly anorexic...recycling the same tired paradigms of control, perfectionism, and family strife."
2,The Virtue of Selfishness by Ayn Rand,"The Virtue of Selfishness without a doubt is a good book to read if you're looking to understand a an egoistic philosophy. The book adequetly voices its opinion, however, it is at times hard to follow. The reader may tend to trial away from the work. Yet, Ayn's ideals are worth attempting to understand."
1,perfect for fans; mere LINGUISTIC DRAMATICS for the rest,"A perfect book for those who are ALREADY fans of Ayn Rand and her LINGUISTIC RADICALISM.The basic idea of ""not taking altruism to extremes --to the point of MEANINGLESS self-sacrifice-- is one that no SENSIBLE person could possibly argue against.But Rand takes a word, defines it to an ABSURD EXTREME --thereby PROVOKING A REACTION-- and spends the rest of the book RANTING ENDLESSLY against it. While reading, one is continually bothered by the question: ""but who defines it to THIS extreme, but Rand herself and her kind only?"".Ridiculous LINGUISTIC DRAMATICS. Perfect for those who hunger for provocative speech; again, perfect for Ayn Rand's fans. The rest of us who would rather be persuaded by CONTENT, are left wanting."
3,my subjective take on it...,Cold war ramblings. People throw words like rationality and enlightenment around and all over randian or marxist - college minded arenas etc. this is a historically significant book but for those seeking less reactive and more stable ideologies I'd recommend something else.
2,Not My Cup of Philosophy,"I knew that coming in, I would not like this book. It did inform me about the Objectivist philosophy, which I wanted, but this philosophy, in application, reduces man to a mercenary character. The fact that Ms. Rand quotes her own novels in support of her ideas (yes, yes, and to explain the reasoning for the novels as well) causes me to think that little research has been done in supporting her theories. Dr. Branden has some pretty outmoded ideas about where homosexuality, psychopathy and autism come from as well, and they seem to be pulled out of the air in order to support his points.All in all, not, to my mind, a life pattern to follow"
4,Bold Ideas,"I love the bold title of this book, after years of indoctrination with the magnificence of collectivism it is refreshing to have the individual proclaimed worthwhile, even supreme.Many of the concepts in this book were very challenging for me making it difficult in writing this review. I spent many hours poring over comments to be sure I understand, however I am not sure. This book explains among other issues man rights, the nature of government & racism. I especially liked Ms Rand's discussion on the origin of values and how that which benefits ones life is its standard. From my reading I have come to the understanding that the only legitimate transactions are that of a trader, wherein parties' voluntarily engage in commerce in an effort to benefit both.It seems that as results of years of communitarian programming the concept of enlighten self interest is so counterintuitive, or perhaps it is rejected so harshly because it contradicts state doctrine, just like evolution does the church."
4,An Excellent Exposition on Government as well as Philosophy,"Rand's explanation of the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights is very impressive. She has a grasp of the exact principles that the Founding Fathers intended. I would recommend this book not only to the beginning philosopher, but also to students of government, politics, and ethics."
5,A great motivator,"The book is a gem... one that efficiently kills even the last traces of complacency, instills confindence, is a great motivator, a driver of change and progress. It is a must read for any-one and everyone who dreams to make a lasting contribution to the world.Rand does take you to the extreme - you do at times feel it isn't really this binary -- Let that pass as an author's license. Focus on the message, the philosophy -- and that is what makes the book worth its weight in gold."
1,Sheer demagoguery,"No, nobody ever found the dictionary that Rand used to define ""selfishness"" - because it never existed. She didn't redefine it at all; she meant by it exactly what everybody else means by it, and it's not a virtue.All she did in this series of ""philosophical"" essays was try to rationalize self-absorption by ""proving"" that it wasn't really harmful after all. But she couldn't even accomplish *that* task competently; if it's true, as she argues in the essay another reviewer cites, that there aren't any real conflicts of interest among rational people, then why bother to distinguish ""selfish"" from ""unselfish""?No, Rand's ""ethics"" is just a thinly disguised rationalization of her own utter inability to care about anyone other than herself. She was exactly like her fictional ""hero,"" Howard Roark: other people just weren't *real* to her, except as props for her own vastly overinflated and terminally unhealthy EGO. And this book is supposed to explain why that's okay.It isn't."
4,A treasure,"I have an emotional connection to this book, and by consequence to Rand, because it is Rand's work that motivated me into becoming a full-fledged libertarian. Rand, in it, offers a wonderful collection of essays, and in particular a theory of individual rights rooted in Aristotlean ethics. Were more people to read this chef d'oeuvre by Ms Rand, they would rid themselves of any ignorance on what she actually advocated (too many ""critics"" of Objectivism haven't the faintest idea.) Ms Rand was, in my opinion, too averse to reading and understanding her intellectual opponents and did not succeed in fully developing her system of philosophy, but she nonetheless provided the groundworks for future Objectivists (e.g. David Kelley) to build on. For anyone seriously interested in Ayn Rand and Objectivism, this is where to start."
5,another fine example of Ayn Rand's clear thinking,"I think you should read her fiction first and only then read this. Its definitely not a conformist book, none of her books ever are. It's refreshing, because here's finally a book that says its okay to put yourself first. It basically says that everyone is actually selfish, but that is not bad. Even self-proclaimed altruists have a selfish reason for being that way-- they are doing something they believe in and thus attaining happiness. Anyone who proclaims he/she is unselfish is lying. This book helps explain John Galt and Roark's characters better."
1,Huh?,"Who is this muttonhead from Jacksonville who says, ""The negative reviewers below insist that self-sacrifice is necessary""? I just read all of those negative reviews and didn't find a single one advocating ""self-sacrifice."" I did find several who thought (correctly) that Rand had given a bad definition of sacrifice.Do ALL Objectivists lapse into Randy jargon at every hint of criticism? Can ANY of them represent an opposing position accurately?"
2,"Big Ayn Rand fan, not so hot on this book",The format of this book is not what I expected. It is basically a set of essays that don't really present one with much information. If you have read the two major novels - The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged (both five stars) - then much of the ideas are repeated in a less effective manner. THere are sections in both of the novels consisting of 50-100 pages that do a much better job presenting the overall Objectivist philosophy. This one isn't really worth the money.
2,Why Argue?,"Some find it strange that, while I am a strong believer in free markets, trade and the ""Chicago School"" of economics, I despise Ayn Rand. There are two reason - first, Rand is no philosopher, and second, I am a pragmatist (i.e., I don't see the need for an abstract moral philosophy to justify things).In this book, Rand violates one of the most important philosophical laws: David Hume's statement that ""No 'is' implies an 'ought.'"" Just because an organism has a tendency to survive does not mean it has a moral right to.Capitalism has transformed the world and raised the standards of living. This is the true (and pragmatic) virtue of capitalism and self-interest. This virtue rests not on some abstract philosophy, but in the lives of billions of people on this planet.All Rand has done is create a straw-man for the socialists and communists who despise capitalism to attack, for her arguments cannot be logically defended, and she is too extreme. Let capitalism speak for itself."
1,A brilliant book?,"Mrs. O'Connor's (nee Rosenbaum) ""The Virtue of Selfishness"" is an unoriginal, hopelessly confused, ruthlessly illogical presentation of a morality that has never been thought legitimate by anyone past adolescence: a morality of pure self-interest, which expressly forbids direct concern for the well-being of anyone but oneself and calls the result ""virtue."" Many people are incapable of questioning the stale doctrine of false autonomy they learned in O'Connor's books or in Objectivist study groups. It is precisely to encourage that type of mentality that Mrs. O'Connor wrote her ""treatise"" - which is actually no such thing, but merely a collection of short topical essays by two ""giants"" who considered themselves not bound by ""conventional"" morality: Mrs. O'Connor herself, and her adulterous lover Nathan Blumenthal (""Nathaniel Branden""), twenty-five years her junior."
2,"ONE valid idea, drowned in COUNTLESS clutter","There is no arguing with those who already like Ayn Rand and enjoy her linguistic dramatics.But that is precisely what makes everyone else not take her seriously--she is more DRAMATIC than BRILLIANT or INCISIVE.The very idea of not carrying altruism to the extreme, by not meaninglessly sacrificing oneself because of expectations imposed upon us, indeed stands up to scrutiny.But this particular book is more than anything else about taking an idea, or even a word definition, to an extreme which not too many sensible people do anyway, and verbosely ranting against it in --yet again-- dramatic ways. A few valid ideas are no licence to engage, too, in tirades that open us to suspicions of paranoia or hidden ""issues"".Ayn Rand needs to acquire greater faith in the persuasive powers of SUBSTANCE, and less on FLOWERY or RADICAL WORDS.A perfect book for fans of hers. For the rest of us, it's a struggle to get through the first ten pages."
4,Best work of non-fiction,"If i were to suggest to someone an introduction of Ayn Rand's writing it would be ANTHEM and THE FOUNTAINHEAD. But if I were to suggest an introduction to her philosophy, it would be THE VIRTUE OF SELFISHNESS.While all of her philosophy doesn't really stand in terms of personal happiness, and some of her views against things like Environmentalism really just are not well-considered, I think her moral basis for capitalism is the most important and pressing matter of her philosophy, and something that people in American society could really benefit from an understanding of.Highly recommended."
5,A Complete Lesson for Children,"I felt this book is a must for children. It is the best book I have read to teach children how to protect themselves. There are so many tricks people use to get access to children. This book covers them all, including trickery, deceit and secrets. It also teaches children to listen to their own internal warning system. This is so important so they will act on it and not ignore it.I was not sure how to approach the topic with my 4 year olds. This book made it possible to prepare them without scaring them."
5,"a little scary, but our daughter likes it","This book is hard for parents to read I think. I find that it is scary and difficult to talk about, however, my 3 and a half year old loves this book. She wanted to read it every day for the first week we had it (this is pretty big since we have hundreds of books and live walking distance to our library). It's a read along and talk story, so she can ask questions right along with us. I feel like she is too young for it, but she isn't uncomfortable and will talk about this book even randomly sometimes, so maybe she is the right age for it if she isn't scared or worried about telling me. This subject is a big deal for parents and I know we all just want to do right by our kids, I don't know if this is the best book out there, but it works for us."
5,well written,"this book is well written. At first I was like this scenario is a little frightening, but then I realized that it cam totally happen and its probably good that it is in there. its not like spooky scarey for kids at all. just hard to swallow as a parent that it could and is a reality. overall the book was very well written and my 4 yr old understood."
5,Eye opening to adults as well as children,"While sharing this book with several adult friends (male and female) Who had been victims of child sexual abuse. The main comment,""Where was a book like this when I was a child? As parents it is our responsibility to equipt our children with as much knowledge and awareness as we can. The Right Touch is the right book for all Loving Parents to share with there children"
5,We love this book.,"My son and I read this book a couple of times a week. He even tells me now what he thinks is a ""good touch"" and a ""bad touch"". I recommend this to all parents!"
4,"Good book, but could be better,",There are two books by this aithor. I bought this one. It really should be one book or a combined set. It is hard to review the book because oddly enough for such an important railroad there is very little available.I think the price could be a little lower allowing for the purchase of both books but althought you may not be delighted you won't be disappointed.The book is well written with a nice amount of photos. It is a good book. Someday this might nit be as good a book but until someone publishs a better work about the LIRR I doubt you will find anything better
2,Manilow CD Review,I was enthused when I saw this ensemble of Manilow's recordings - however the fidelity of this CD is very poor. I would not recommend this CD to anyone because of the poor quality.
3,"Good overview, but is missing something...","The book is very informative in many ways than one. I was really excited when I received the book. Although I have to agree with one of the reviews given by an earlier reader, most of the book's information on employee requirements could have been obtained on the fbi's website (fbi.gov). The tips given, were okay but we have to face the fact that we'll never have an in depth detail about how to really get in the bureau because it's so confidential. So I was somewhat disappointed. But if you're someone beginning college and are thinking about a career as a special agent, this book is a good guide for you."
2,Not a bad overview,"Ackerman gives a thorough overview of the FBI application process and covers all the essentials. He notably also considers technical and support empployment. However, the publisher's notes and reviews led me to believe there would be a great deal more depth, at least in the sections relating to testing and interviewing. Rather than the treatment of a serious test preparation book (for the SAT's or GRE's), Ackerman does little but graze the surface of the testing and interview process. Most of the information in this book can be gleaned from the FBI's web pages at FBI.GOV and by general inference therefrom..."
4,"A ""can have"" Book","For a point of reference, I purchased this book only days before my Phase I exam. Like a previous reader, I too believe this book was not that great as a ""test preparation"" guide. However, I don't believe this to be the objective of the author, Ackerman. Had it been, I would have given it a 2 out of 5. You're best bet for cognitive test preparation is to search for other guides or download similar (or harder) math exams, like I did.That being said, as a tool for those interested in a career with the FBI, I believe this book to be an excellent buy, hence my 4 out of 5 review. Although there were plenty of sections that I found very useful, such as the Selection Process Flowchart and the ""Standing Out from the Crowd"" chapter, there is a good deal of information in this book that would be very interesting to read, AFTER I finish my Federal Appliation for employment. Again, like a previous reader, I would say that the forms in the appendices are superfluous."
1,Totally inaccurate,"I am in the process of applying to the FBI ... and bascially this book is entirely wrong about the flow of the application process amoungst other things. It has some good advice and some accurate facts, but those are taken directly from the Special Agent Application Handbook, which is free to download from [local website] Save the [money amount]and download the best parts for free."
1,Not much info here.,I thought that this would be a good book to help me prepare for the phase 1 testing and what else is to come. Most of the recomendations are just common sense and all of the information was redily available on the internet for free.
5,The best place to start,"As someone who is in the final screening phase of the Special Agent hiring process, this book is highly recommended. While it does not have everything, it is a very well packaged collection of information on the hiring process, and it covers various assignments and things about the FBI Academy training. I've verified many things in the book through my own experiences or discussions with FBI Agents. Well worth the price."
5,Attention to Detail.,"Anyone who reads Thomas Ackerman's book and does not discover substantially more pertinent information than the FBI has on its website is lacking one of the most important abilities the FBI looks for in its applicants - attention to detail. The ability to compare and analyze data is critical to the success of federal law enforcement officers. In this case, there is no comparison. Ackerman's book takes readers into areas the FBI would never post on their website. In particular, the Phase II interview and writing exercise is exactly as characterized in Ackerman's book - a significant advantage to those who have the information in advance. In other words, although the FBI is very tight-lipped about Phase II, Ackerman isn't. The rest of the book is equally as accurate and informative. It worked for me. No sour grapes here."
3,The good book,The protagonist was the kids.They wanted to find the Antisct. They wanted to find the Antisct ccauce he was going to destroy the earth.My favorite part is when they find out who the Aniscts is.
2,This book was hindered by poor characters.,"I read this book thinking it would be similar to Jane Yollen and Bruce Coville's stunning Armaggedeon Summer. Instead, it seemed preachy. The teen characters were unrealistic and bland. The story line was uninvolving, and it may promote harmful accusations of the Antichrist. It had a few good parts, but it was mostly a waste of time."
2,"OK-I repeat,OK- nothing more.","I finished this fairly short book in a fairly short time, but I still wished I had spent my time doing something else. The plot was ok, the setting was ok, the characters were ok (but not well developed), and the premise was neat but lacking. I suppose a one-word summary for this book would be lacking. There was not by any means anything bad about this book. Some people might like it. But to me it was an OK book. There is nothing wrong with an ok book. However, there are so many great books to read that an ok book just dosen't cut it."
4,"Readable, Practical, and Useful","Whether or not you subscribe to the philosophy of ""the leader of the pack"", and whether or not you have a dog with aggressive tendencies, you will find this book full of useful advice. Very importantly, it provides some frank discussion about training ourselves to be good dog owners. Most of us will recognize ourselves in some of the people behaviors that need changing to prevent ""issues"" from arising as our dogs get older. If you are training a puppy or if you need to re-train your older dog, this is a good book to read and re-read.Training The City Dog: Tips For High-Rise Housebreaking, Banishing Barking, Critical Commands, Proper Petiquette, And Uniquely Urban Situations"
4,good but not great,"This book is generally good and effective at explaining a good relationship between a dog and his or her owner. But, there are a few things that i have learned from my experience in numerous training classes and from working a boarding kennel that I disagree with."
2,a disappointment,"There are some great moments of Sergio's virtuoso piano playing and jams with the band, but I really wanted to hear Lani Hall & Karen Phillip singing live. They are all over the place!! None of those perfect streamlined harmonies of the studio albums. It's like they were on different stages at different times. Now I have to beleive their television appearances back then were lip-synched. There is a Live At The Hollywood Bowl album with Brasil '77 & different singers that is much better."
1,Quality Issue,"I purchased the 4-way version a little more than a year ago, and the signal quality degraded slowly until one day it was unwatchable. I returned it at the store I bought it, and was issued the CVT-2/8PIAII instead (the 4 port version is now obsolete). After initial installation, the channels were all perfect, but then a few days later the signal quality on the lower channels became very poor (bypassing short run brings quality back to perfect). Contacted the manufacturer and they stated I would need to RMA again (incurring shipping fees and $30/hour penalties if they don't detect the same issue). Rather than exchanging again and crawling in my attic per failure I'll try another vendor and hopefully be done with it."
5,damn uncut live funk,heard this a while back if you wanna check out how p-funk was at concert check this this is the greatest show on earth the pfunk all stars are all here and ready to kick the funk ouit the planet.
1,Uniden 2.4,"i would not recomend this unit to my worst enemy, over a year ago i purchased this unit, i can on time howver i could charge the unit, i tried for 2 day, then i called tech support, and the people that the unit was purchased from, the said that he would call back, guss what i am still waiting. so far i could not and have not used this device. it still sits ina the box the warranty, 30 day i belive have long since ran out. so i have lost all fund, used to buy this product. i gave this unit 1 start because the system would not allow a lowe rating. in my openion run from this unit"
2,too small,I didn't realize or just didn't pay attention to how small this is. I surely wouldn't have paid so much to have it shipped.
2,book just didn't provide any detailed,"I have reviewed this book on several occasions looking for items that could help me do some scenes. I have found that it does very little to help you produce any of the many renders that are displayed. If you are looked for a step-by-step tutorial on how to do these scenes, you are looking at the wrong book. Like one of the earlier reviewer, I too have taught Maya at one of the colleges in the North East."
4,Dont rely on books to be a PRO,"I picked up this book due to the insights it gives. It is a great reference book if you have industry experience and want a different perspective on certain situations, that always occur in the wonderful world of CGI visual effects. If you want a sneek peek at the way its done at the grand end of the industry scale then you will probably not find a better book currently available, if on the other hand your wanting to filch ideas from the big boys and girls, and use them to be passed of as your own creative genious then Im afraid that the no book on earth will help you, and why should it.JS"
3,not as good as Dona Maria,"I ordered this mole sauce, rather than picking up a jar of Dona Maria at the local store, because I had read several reviews which claimed it was much better. I disagree. I found the Rogelio Bueno mole to be much sweeter, with more cinnamon; with less complexity and less chocolate and smoky flavors than the Dona Maria. My husband compared the Rogelio Bueno mole to spicy gingerbread. Everyone in my house strongly preferred the Dona Maria. I know mole varies greatly, but the Rogelio Bueno mole did not remind me of the mole I've had in Mexico. I will not be buying it again."
3,Ho Hum,"I bought this for my 5 year old son. He loves puzzles, games (card & board) & trains so I thought this would be perfect for him. So far, we have gotten it out to play several time but it doesn't seem to spark his interest. I had imagined him sitting for hours making all kinds of layouts but that hasn't materialize yet. To be fair, we've only had the game a short time so it may catch on."
4,Decent family game,"This is an attractive and fun matching game that you can play competitively or cooperatively. The whole family can work together to assemble the pieces into a coherent whole, like a jigsaw puzzle but without the tedium. Or you can take turns placing the pieces onto a single structure as per the rules. Our 4 year old loves the game and he loves the art work, as do his 4 year old friends."
3,My grand kids and I were disappointed with the game.,"My grand kids (age 3 and 5) were not too taken by this game, nor was I. By the title, I had thought there might be some colorful little cars, trains, and boats to go with the puzzle pieces, boy was I wrong. Very dull colored-puzzle parts, and certainly no frills.We were all disappointed and did not play the game too long. Hopefully, the other games we ordered will be more interesting and fun. In fact, the kids said, ""Grandma, this game is boring. Can we please play another game?""Thanks,L. Sylvia"
4,Spooky tales of Hawaii,"Being an island girl, some place references are inaccurate, that is why this book does not get 5 stars. But it does it job in scaring you. Warning: do not read at night. My favorite scary book of the Hawaiian islands is ""Obake Files""."
1,DermaDoctor Has Hiked the Price X3 in Less Than a Year!,"We really felt this product helped our little one with a skin condition that has posed a great financial challenge to manage. Insurance does not help with many of the products that provide some relief, including Carmol Shampoo. We have used the Carmol lotion with good results, but for some reason the price of the shampoo is markedly higher. The shampoo was initially introduced under $30 per bottle, and the folks at DermaDoctor have now THRICE raised the price now to a whopping near-$50 per bottle. Unfortunate because those who need this product are mostly special-needs cases who are already financially strapped by their ailments. There is no more money left to exploit from our child's medical problem...we have been milked dry. Sadly, we (and I suspect others) are now going to have to go without. :-("
1,Beware,The product contains Lauryl Sulfate which is absolutely no help for sensitive or itching scalps
2,"Well...Not exactly ""new technology"" as the ad name suggests","After noticing there was a download glitch during the fashion disc download phase, I took note and telephoned the software company who makes this product. Lo and behold, I find out that this product is in fact not that new and therefore they don't even offer online interactive components for the makeup portion anymore. As for those of you who use XP Pro, as I do, forget about using any online interactive functions or getting those great additional fashions mentioned with the software. It can't support XP Pro in that regard. Also, they told me there are no further upgrades planned for this product. I don't think this was such a great deal at all."
5,Scarily accurate portrayal of the minds of children,"This collection of stories gets inside the heads of kids. Furst reveals voices of children that are eerily familiar but more expressive than even the most articulate child could ever be. He has a particularly good eye for detail. His memory for the stuff we had as kids--and our bizarre attachment to these tv shows and toys--could be the stuff of a bad 90s movie. But Furst uses this attention to detail for much more than ironic ""retro"" nostalgia. In a least redemptive interpretation, these stories could question whether it is all worth it. At their most respectful, the stories give kids a kind of respect that they very rarely get, even though they deserve it.Oh, and it is also very funny."
1,Dirt Devil is not worth the money,"I purchased this as an easy to use hard floor sweeper thinking it would pick up little messes here and there. WRONG! It did not sweep even the smallest amount of crumbs without spitting them out the back. I emptied the cup several times thinking it was in wrong but nothing helped. Absolutely no sweeping power as when you moved it back and forth like a vacuum, it spewed out what you just swept right out the back! I couldn't even give this thing away and ended up just tossing it out."
1,it'a just a bad floor sweeper,"I was excited to get this product but was so disappointed when I used it! The cups are too small to hold enuf dirt so you have to empty it frequently.It's hard to manuver on carpet and can't pick anything up on carpet. It gets stuck allot.My biggest mistake was discarding the box right away, as I've bought Dirt Devil products before and was happy, so I couldn't return it! Oh well another $50 down the drain!I gave it to a disabled friend who has allot of birds. She says it helps but doesn't pick up enuf that she would throw away her broom!Stat away from this one!I give it a 0 which wasn't an option on the list!"
5,Awesome!,"I bought this over the weekend (at Home Depot) and LOVE it! It worked great on my kitchen floor (linoleum), all my hardwood floors and my large area rug and 2 runner rugs (very low profile/not plush)The dirt cups are small - but I did my whole house (8 rooms) and didn't have to empty until I was done. The cups should be emptied after every deep cleaning anyway. If the dirt cups are overflowing to the point of needing emptying in the middle of regular cleaning (ie, not a mess like broken plant or box of cereal) then your problem isn't a small dirt cup - your problem is not cleaning your floors often enough."
3,Permaculture? It's not so hard after all.,"This large format book discloses a lot of the more questionable claims of the Permaculture movement. Holmgren is neither a highly qualified nor a particularly scientific advocate of the system that he claims joint ownership of originating. In this book we discover that using Permaculture a small family may still possess two cars; it's okay to be on the electricity grid and any number of modern appliances from computers to light engines may be used in your 'Permaculture' system. Really the whole thing amounts to little more than recreational farming. I have rated this book as three stars because it is an important read for anyone interested in the truth behind the field. However, in general it is an unimpressive collection of notes from someone designing a small farm."
5,"MMMMMM, THAT'S NICE MAX!!!",A very enjoyable reunion concert by the funniest band in the world. These guys are just brilliant. Also buy the CD 'CORNOLOGY' -- a great overview of the band's recordings.
1,Where is my DVD??,"We have not rec'd our order, how dissappointing , as we are travelling nJuly 10/09 and wanted to have this as a gift for our friends. May 18 /09 order date and not rec'd by July!!! We will be very apprehensive next time with amazon.com"
5,Viva Vivaldi!,"There are not many biographies about Vivaldi because, unfortunately, only a scetch of his life is known. This biography is probably the best contemporary book on him. It is not only a good synopsis of his life but it also has very good insights on his life and music. Landon's insights are especially good when he comments on specific works of Vivaldi. Vivaldi is rightly known as a master concerto composor. However, his voluminous output also included other genre, notably many beautiful operas and sacred works. Landon does a fine job in his book of commenting on these works also and proposing that, epsecially the sacred works, need to be better appreciated and popularized. As a Vivaldi buff (and there are very few of us) I highly recommend this book."
2,Tedious,"Very dry. Endless minutiae. Found myself scanning and skipping paragraphs in search of the life of Vivaldi.There is very little effort made to place this artist within the context of his times. The chapter on Vivaldi's church musicreads like an inventory list, and the chapter on the production of Vivaldi's operas in Ferrara is a collection of petty, verbose, litigious letters.This book may be valuable to some scholars, but for those of us looking for a readable biography, it wasextremely unrewarding."
5,The pictures are beautiful,A friend of mine lent me this book while I was pregnant and I really liked how the poem is made less severe. The children are adorable and the book is a real treasure.
5,Fantastic descriptive story telling,"The TropicsMary! Just finished your book. It occupied my mind and took me on a remarkable journey. I swam with Lilly in the rip and saw what she saw. Her relationship with Glen reminded me of Jake and the boat's crew in the ""Sand Pebbles."" I have known a few Glens in my time. The hurricane actually had me believing I'm missing out by living in the almost storm-less desert. Congratulations. I'm proud to have this book on my shelf, especially with your personal inscription. Bill Robinson"
5,"A comprehensive, excellent introduction","I am a graduate student in the field of photonic and I learned most of what I know about photonic crystals from this book. It is very well written and does not assume much background knowledge, except perhaps some familiarity with basic notions in electromagnetism, which is fair considering the topic. To the mathematically inclined: Joannopoulos emphasizes concepts and numerics over analytic calculations, and therefore you might want to supplement it with another, more mathematically rigorous introduction to electromagnetism in periodic media. It is a great reference book and certainly deserves a spot in the library of every photonics researcher."
2,Worked well first few years,"I'm of the mentality that when I buy something, it should last a long, long time. After about a year of use, I started to notice the audio cutting in and out intermittently. I diagnosed this to be a bad connection and resoldered the joints in the handset. This did not fix the problem; seems like the only thing that works now is the whacking method.Recently, I've been able to hear interference from my neighbors' garage doors opening and closing. Or maybe that's just a coincidence, and I hear random static? In either case, it's unacceptable.So, if you plan on getting a new phone within the next few years, go ahead and get the Sony for now. But don't say I didn't warn you."
2,Completely Ordinary,"It was a competent thriller, but it was much more ordinary than the blurbs had led me to expect. Kevin Anderson called it the Roman equivalent of The Name of the Rose. If it had been such a book, I would have expected that the Library of Alexandria would have played a central role, and that the book would have delivered the secrets of the ancient mystery cults. I'd have been satisfied with the keys to the cult of Mithras at the very least. So since it didn't meet my expectations, I'll give it a grade of C."
4,"A delightful blend of history, plotting, and character","How refreshing to read a book that loves its subject and gracefully incorporates color and detail into a rip-snorting adventure story. Very satisfying, a happy addition to the grand tradition. An high-minded young action hero surrounded by neatly drawn secondary characters, lots of intrigue and plot twists, and really excellent action scenes that draw you into the time and place. Yes, the famous Galilean is always there in the background, and the author does a nice job of playing off the tension between what the reader brings and what's on the page. Recommended."
1,Very forgettable,"Good research on the basis of the Roman legions.Inispid love scenes and plot.Ahh the plot. The one thats so transparent I figured it out in the first 50 pages,Characters abound, most to no real effect.The ending is so absolutely unhistoric and untenable, by time line, by any stretch of the imagination as to be ludicrous.The writer shows promise.But this is hardly something to be proud of.Worthy of a summer afternoon, nothing more."
1,Garbage,I can say without hesitation that this is the worst book that I have ever read. If you are considering buying it - don't. Nothing more needs to be said.
1,not working,I purchaced a phone card on Jan.2 and it didn't arive till Jan.10 and it is not activated and I can't use the darn thing. Please issue me another and send it a.s.a.p.LucyLane
4,Good little printer...,"This printer came free with a digital camera I purchased from Amazon, and I have not been disappointed with the printer.The printer came with everything I needed in the box to connect it to the computer, and it came with ink and software as well.It prints about average speed, and has various print quality settings to choose from when printing photos.For text, I have a B&W; laser printer, but I kept this one for the occasional color document and for photos.If I were looking for a photo printer, this one would not be my main choice, but it does a decent job for the occasional family photos.The picture quality on photos is enough for my uses, but it is not quite as good as a more expensive printer would give, but good enough for framing a picture of our son to give grandpa, etc.I enjoy the fact that you can plug a memory card directly into the printer to print pictures.Overall, I am happy with the printer, especially since it was free for me!"
3,IT WAS FREE...,"I GOT THIS FREE FROM AMAZON FOR BUYING A DIGITAL CAMERA. PRINTS OUT OK PICS, BUT RAN OUT OF INK FAST!!!!!!!!"
2,Slow and noisy,"I have this printer in my office and am considering replacing it with an Epson. I has a lot of features.. espcially for the price (i.e. direct input from a camera or a memory card),but it is very slow and noisy. The print quality is very good.. as are most ink jet printers in this price range. But it is very slow and noisy. Did I say slow and noisy?"
1,RIPOFF!! Bad Deal Here,"I got the printer only to find that it doesn't come with a cord to connect it to your computer. After wasting my time going to three different places, the cheapest one was for $50.Amazon's advertisement that this is ""free"" with the purchase of a camera is misleading to say the least as it's not honest about the extra $$$$ you have to spend just for a connecting cord. In my opinion, this has been very frustrating and a TOTAL RIPOFF!!"
1,Very expensive to run,Dont be fooled by the low price. The printer uses combined color cartridges with very small capacity. These have to be replaced even if one of the colors gets finished and cost more than the printer. Not sure what canon was thinking - are we supposed to use the printer once and then throw it away instead of getting an ink cartridge.ps : I have traditionally been a big fan of canon having used their photo printers for the last 3 years.
2,Below average,"As everyone else is reporting, this printer is pretty expensive to maintain- the printer cartridges combined cost about $60 and that lasts me approximately 2-3 months. I print only a few pages a day, typically only in fast-draft. I heard about Walgreen's new inkjet refilling that costs a fraction of buying a new cartridge, but of course these cartridges are excluded from most of the Canon's being able to be refilled. Finally, I have had my printer for 9 months and after about month 5, my photos are often printed with smears on the front and back of pictures (even after using the printer's neat tools to fix smearing problems). Consequently, I highly reccomend not purchasing this printer, even if it is a good deal- in the end, it's not cost-effective or worth your money at all."
4,Canon printer,"I just received this canon printer this week, i tried it out over the weekend with the new digital camera that i got. personaly i can say that this printer works wonderful on photos. I am not sure how much ink it will use yet since i just got it, so that could be the down side to this printer. I also haven't tried to print any documents from this printer either, so that could be another down fall. I have to admit though i was a little worried about this printer printing pictures but the ones that i tried turned out wonderful. It is really a great printer for the price for what i can see. It also has two memory card slots that you can insert your memory card and print right from there, the only bad thing about it is that you have to know what picture number you want to print sinse there is no screen to view the picture. but you can also choose the option on the printer to print all of the pictures on your memory card. I hope this helps."
1,No drivers,"There are no Linux drivers for this printer. If you have this printer and run Linux, please contact tech support about the problem. They might get some sense, and produce drivers at some point. I've had the printer over a year, and no sign of drivers."
2,not a good choice,"The photos are nice (that is the only reason I give it two stars), but it uses ink like its going out of style and the cartrdiges are very expensive. If you replace both ink cartridges it is less expensive to buy a new printer. That's exactly what I did. This product is not recommended (if you can afford the ink you should be able to afford a printer with more features)."
2,1200 pages of not much useful,"Wow, what a disappointment! This book starts with Hello World and goes down hill. 3 pages describing how a label control works then 3.5 pages of code print out, then 2.5 more pages adding explanation to just about every line of code? No wonder it is 1200 pages.With my last forms work mostly being VB5, and having done mostly ASP.NET, web service, and library work in .NET, I got this book thinking that I would learn a few useful tidbits. (Which is how I found the author's other C# book). Not the case. I'm not sure I learned anything!I guess for the most timid beginner this book would be OK, but if you have any previous win forms program experience or an inclination to just try things out, save yourself time and money and simply open up a form and start dropping in controls and see how they work."
1,DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!,"This book doesn't provide supports if you have any questions about this book, and don't have full codes in some chapters!"
3,"Nice story, but THE SPELLING!!!","I actually liked this book fairly well; it's nicely done magical realism, with something of a twist ending. I question the legality of using Ricky Martin as a character, but that's unimportant from a reader's point of view. And I thought Mr. Lopez did a fine job of writing from the point of view of a teenage girl -- so many male author's get this completely wrong.But... the spelling. The paragraphs. Did the editor just lie about having checked it? In chapter four alone, the word ""role"" is repeatedly misspelled as ""roll"" and the name of Empress Sisi of Austria is repeatedly rendered ""Sissy Empress."" Plus, the rule about making a new paragraph every time a new character speaks is almost never employed. If you care about the English language at all, this book might make you cringe."
2,not what expected,Was expecting a professionally produced documentary on teardrop trailers. This was a teachers personally produced video. Just not what expected.
1,beneath Amazon to offer this rental,"compare this to professionally produced documentaries and you'll come off seeing it the way i do. it's written, directed, produced and hosted by the same person. do yourself a favor, watch the huell howser video on camper history. this video is more suited to be an informational video that you see in a museum exhibit. you know the ones where you're just so excited to be able to sit down you grin and bear it. i was prepared to ask for a refund if it was a $3.99 rental, but i only paid $1.99 so i let it slide. other reviewers gave it 5 stars? i can only assume that they're family members posing as unbiased viewers."
3,"Good Idea, pump didn't last","Most of you will not use it every day like me, but the pump broke within a few months, the first winter. the foot pump is plastic and it cracked due to cold. the tubing is cheap clear plastic that crimps and the tank plug is cheap foam. I replaced the pump and will likely replace the tubing next as it crimps."
4,something else to interest you,"This is most certainly a worth while book to spend some time with. Reading these early Buddhist-travel journals is a rare pleasure indeed. If you are looking for something similar, and in many ways more enchanting, check out John Blofeld's book, ""The Wheel of Life: The Autobiography of a Western Buddhist."" The time periods are similar with Neel's, but Blofeld spends most of his time not in Tibet, but in China, exporing back woods monasteries and meeting up with taoists and other mountain ascetics. It's just wonderful."
4,Fasinating adventure of a 55-year old woman traveling in disguise for 4 months to reach Lhasa in 1923,"In 1923 at the age of 55, Alexandra David-Neel disguised herself as an old Tibetan pilgrim and traveled for four treacherous months with her young companion, Lama Yongden, all the way to Lhasa, becoming the first European woman ever to enter Lhasa. Along the way, she had to endure the primitive and often dangerous travel conditions, and the ever-present danger of being caught.I really liked this adventure book for its honest descriptions of an earlier, purer Tibetan culture, long before the Chinese invasion. She writes honestly and candidly about the customs and values of the people she meets, neither romanticizing nor criticizing."
5,A spectacular find in a used book store!,"This woman's incredible journey to Tibet shoud be an inspiration to all women interested in travel. Her determination to complete this journey, and the physcial strength it took to manage it, was awesome."
1,Massively Overrated,"I did not see what the big deal was, and would not recommend it. Her language and the way she treated people is offensive, Eurocentric, condescending and narrow-minded -- typical of many travel books of this period. For those trying to learn about Tibet, there is not enough here to satisfy. This is your classic I-am-to-be-admired-because-I-left-the-comforts-of-civilization-applaud-me themed books. She is not a traveller but a trophy collector."
3,for beginners?,"i think this book is not detailed enough, as compared with its titile""how to do everything with html&xhtml"".After i finished reading this book, i started to build my web site. But, the problem is i don't know what attributes and values i can use within style sheets. and the effort to understand all that stuff is really frustrating.And i am confused about whether the attribute is from html or xhtml, can i use them? the book don't provide a list of all the stuff with its usage and possible values, attributes as a reference, and the pdf file i downloaded from the author's web site is useless because most of them is listed in the book and they are just not detailed enough, it is just a book for beginners and it should be marked as level 1."
5,Excellent book!!!,"For a first book on this topic I found the depth of coverage and pace to be perfect. Very easy painless coverage of topic.Not too slow, and not too fast where you feel like you're lost.Nothing is taken for granted(Author assumes you know nothing), yet you are not treated like a ""dummy"" or ""complete idiot""."
2,"Not worth it, no android support","I purchased one of these recently and it's a tad on the stupid side. Pairing is convoluted at best, their tech support is a joke, and the fact you have to run a third-party app rather than sticking with the standards is infuriating. If you have an android device don't even bother, eggheads far smarter than i have tried and failed. If you have a palm, blackberry, symbian or winXP device and a desperate need to look silly, go for it. The technology in the hardware is undoubtedly cool, it's just unfortunate that the proprietary software is garbage."
1,incompatible with latest techs of today 2011.,"windows 7, apple, and windows phone 7 are not compatible. visit their official site for older compatible phones. This is really old."
1,don't waste your time or money,The G-Tech keyboard looks like a sweet work tool but is a major disappointment. Avoid this product. I can't believe it is still for sale.
4,Good Quality and nice software!,This is my first DVD burner. I choose this model after much resarch and have not regretted the choice. It was easy to install and indeed has some nice software (Nero and Studio 8).I bought this along with DVD Xcopy by 321 Studio because of the reviews of Xcopy and how well it works. (see review of Xcopy)Looking to burn you home digital movies or back up others stuff! This will do it with ease.
4,Nice drive,"Nice drive and a good price - but the title is incorrect:""TDK 4x2;16x10x32 Internal IDE DVD+R/-RW/CD-RW Driveby TDK "" Is *does not* read or write DVD -R or DVD -RW. The description lists the correct formats."
1,Don't Buy this Drive....,I work as a sys engineer and no matter what application (Nero or Roxio)...the burner will not burn 1x media (Ritek) Dvd-Rthe slowest it can burn is 2x....(no where on the box does it say that this unit cannot record 1x dvd media)save yourself the trouble and buy a Sony that can support 1x media....tech support for tdk is abysmal...took me 1 week of calling to finally get someone to find out that this drive cannot burn 1x medias
1,No go Mico,"This faucet is prone to failure in the mixer and single-handle faucet ball joint. This causes it to deliver inconsistent mix of water, and to leak from the top. It's also very difficult to clean and the spray is so heavy that it can chip counter tops and/or sinks if dropped.Be aware that Mico does not honor its limited lifetime warranty for products purchased at some retailers. In my case, the large home supply store I purchased it from went out of business. Now that my faucet is broken, it is not covered by their warranty - despite the warranty card contained in the original box.Bottom line unreliable, overprice product, and you can't count on the company honoring its warranty. Be prepared to be disappointed."
3,10 inch - what it stands for?,"This is an OK item. I did not want to have 3 screens and I did not want to have three-headed dragon (8/11/13) in one either. Such a monster would stick out to far. Considering that I have 7.5, 8 and 10 inches pans I wanted to have one screen, which would work on all my pans. Unfortunately, you never know what 10 inches stands for in real world - is it designed for 10-inches pans or is it its own diameter (and if so - outer or inner)? The harsh reality is that item's outer diameter is 9 3/4 inches. It covers 8 inches pan well and dose not stick out too far and it lies inside 10 inches pan (lodge, all clad) but does not go to deep, stays very close to the top of the pan. It is what I wanted, but real 10 inches would work better in my case. I decided to keep the item but I wish to see more descriptive descriptions from the seller and manufacturer.Quality? You really care, you will certainly find something better at Williams-Sonoma for $50-$60"
3,Got exactly what I paid for.,"I ordered this game for my nephew b/c I remember having one as a kid, and me and my friend's would play it for hours on end. I couldn't find it at any stores in my area. Including Toy R Us, Walmart, Target, Big Lots, Kmart. So I found it on Amozon and had it shipped w/ free shipping in 2 days. My nephew liked it but became indirrerant to it really fast. But I got the game I wanted on time and with great service. To the seller I give a 10+ and same to Amozon 10+. To the toy itself, I'm afraid it might be past it's time. There's so many electronic games and Star Wars, Lego's etc. 7 for game."
4,Lots of fun!,Love nostalgic toys! This one is great! Bought this for Christmas for my nephew and everyone from the family wanted to try it out!
4,Gets frustrations out,Helps kids and some adults get pinned up frustrations out of their systems. And it brings back many fond memories of playing this with my Dad and oldwe brothers.
2,Disappointing,"I remember having a blast with my brother & this game many moons ago. Too much is different on the new version, and it was almost impossible to pop off the heads. Not to mention the difficulty in putting it together.."
1,THIS SUCKS,NO quality cheap plastic does not work do not waste your money THANKS MATTEL and CHINA for messing up what should be a GREAT TOY !!
4,Great Toy,My son loves this toy. It was not sold in the local stores but he had to have it for Christmas. It is a very durable toy and a lot of fun.
4,Sock'em Once Again!,"It's back!!!! A new, smaller version of the game we all grew up with. It's not exactly same but what is, most popular things get redone, it's life. But just because it's a little different doesn't mean you won't love playing it. It's so fun to share this game with younger generations. The heads will pop off easily once in a while but that generally pleases the younger crowed. It's easy to play, it's made for anyone. I would highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone. It's an affordable classic game that you will still be playing for years to come."
3,Centerpieces,"We were in search of a cost effective centerpiece for a charity event. The event entertainment this year was MMA Fights. A regulation size ring was set in the middle of the ballroom and we wanted to stay with the theme.Rock em Sock em ROBOTS were soooooooooooo perfect. Our attendees were all men, and the benefiting charity raises money for children in need. It was a no brainer.We purchased lazy susans, painted them black, and secured the Rock em Sock em's with fugitive glue.Everyone loved it. A bit of nostalgia, toys to donate to some of the benefiting charities and perfectly matched to the MMA fight theme.Winner all the way around"
1,Big disappointment,"I've never played or seen the original but had heard how fun it was so I bought this new version for my 9 year old. We have had it now for 6 months and I am fed up with it to the point that it is being thrown out today. I comes apart very easily and I find pieces of it scattered all around the house. The rope never stays in place, robots come off easily from their stands, it is not sturdy. Sons complain that they have to bang the buttons with their fists and even then the heads sometimes don't pop up. Nobody wants to play it anymore and even their friends ask to play somethings else. I'm sick of tripping over the pieces. I wish I would have known about Amazon's review system before I purchased this. I can understand all of the negative comments and now, before I make a purchase, I check to see if it is carried by Amazon and what others are saying about it."
2,toys gone wrong,One of the robots arms would not retract after one boxing session. Definitely not the product I remember from childhood.
2,not like they use to be,"I bought this for my son for Christmas. I remember playing with them as a kid (ahem, a few years ago)and they were alot of fun. These robots are smaller and it is really hard to get the heads to pop up. It does not stay put together very well either."
1,Rock 'em sock 'em,"The product is tacky, hard to put together and did not engage any of the three children, ages 4-10 years"
4,rock em sock em,really neat old fashioned game. only con is that the rope sides fall off to easily..we are constantly having to fix them!
3,"Yep, it's the same one!","These were around thirty years ago! And they are still the same silly, cheesy toy that used to have a TV commercial that said, ""You knocked my block off!"" I don't know why, but these are back and my son needed to have one. They are not difficult to put together at all. It's just kind of a silly toy. At least they aren't expensive!"
1,Terrible! Don't waste money!,"This toy doesn't work like it did when we were kids. In fact, one of our robots doesn't work at all. The head only pops on one robot and the robots detach from their base almost immediately after you begin play. Don't buy it."
1,Another cheap China ripoff,So Mattel thinks their brand name is worth enough to bring back a classic toy.? But they think so little of American consumers they'll try to sell a piece of junk online where you can't see it.My brothers had the original and I wanted to get one for my son.Skip this version. China keeps knocking out cheap junk ripoffs of Classic American products. Don't fall for it.So Mattel Barbies aren't selling and you want to trade on your good name?Make Quality Products and customers will return. Make junk and you'll keep losing customers.UPDATE August 2007O Mattel and do these have lead paint on them too???Make toys in America to American standards for our children.
2,Disappointed in Retro Toy,"I purchased this toy for a family member who had loved it as a child. Christmas morning we put the toy together and one arm would not hit the opponent no matter what we did. The blue robots arms work perfect, and only one of the red robots arms work. So the toy is useless as who ever takes the red robot is sure to lose. I wouldn't suggest buying this unless you're willing to gamble on it not working right."
2,rotten robots,Not as good as the origninal- the robots are constantly falling off there platform- husband is tired of fixing - kids haven't played with it since the day after Christmas. Not worth the money or the hassle>
3,fun toy for little guys,"My grandson requested this toy for Christmas because one of his friends had one. He loves it - it was inexpensive and didn't need batteries. Hopefully it will last awhile, though it doesn't look too sturdy and it does take a beating. For the money, seems to be a good buy."
1,Not the toy you remember as a kid,Toy assembles easily and resembles toy of years ago but is smaller and flimsier. Limited movement of robots and cheap mechanism holding head on robots from popping up makes it frustrating because the heads are constantly popping up and needing to be reset even if they aren't touched. There are better values elsewhere.
1,Robot game,"I bought this toy because I enjoyed it as a child, but this 1 is made much cheaper. the buttons do not press down right. when the fist hits a face the neck does not extend. it is very difficult to play because of the malfunction. the kids I bought it for are very disappointed. I wanted to order two, but I am sorry I even ordered one."
2,Missed opportunity,"I didnt find the product as bad as indicated in most of the other reviews but it is a disapointment. The original version was much larger, more responsive etc. Too bad Matel didnt use the original specs."
3,It's always broken,"My son got this toy as a gift last X-mas from his favorite uncle. We thought it was cool that Mattel brought this game back to the market. However, it's nothing like the original as far as durability goes. The robot heads pop up whenever they feel like it, they're always popping off of their platforms and the punching buttons don't push down on a regular basis. All of these problems get pretty frustrating for a 4 year old so, the game has spent most of its life at our house on the shelf in my sons closet. As my son would say, ""What a bummer""."
1,VERY POOR REMAKE,"I am a 33 year old female who always found toys for boys more exciting than the ones for girls. I was excited at first to find and purchase this toy for my 7 year old son. I couldn't wait until Christmas Day to play with it myself. My excitement turned out to be disappointment. We took it to our family dinner and my family felt the same. It is nothing like the larger version my aunts uncles and I would play for days and days. They had a great idea when they brought it back, but I wish it were like the ""old school"" version. Like a previous reviewer wrote, ""IF IT AIN'T BROKE, DON'T FIX IT!""."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"I waxed nostalgic and bought this game only to find that it is nowhere near as durable as the old one. Not only is it smaller, but it is flimsy and constantly falling apart. My two year old could easily pull the robots from the base. In fact, only the two year old enjoys it-constanly pulling off the robots and throwing them at everyone. Unless you have money to waste, don't bother buting this game."
2,Not as much fun as I remember,I rememeber this toy being a lot more fun. In this version it's difficult to make the head pop up. You just keep punching forever. After about 3 minutes you get pretty bored. I wouldn't buy it if I could do it again.
1,Waste of Money,"Nothing like the original. Like others have said, one robot is much more sensitive which makes it useless and a huge waste of money. What fun is it to battle when the same one loses almost every time. I wouldn't even give it one star if that wasn't the minimum."
2,Quality is no longer important,Certainly not the same quality as the original. Doesn't work smoothly. One slugger always wins. If you are aware of the difference you can win every match.
3,birthday present,The game was really fun to play with but the rough playing does tend to break it faster. Oh well! It was fun while it lasted!
2,Boxing ring rope rip-off!,"Bought this for my 3 and 4 year olds. It was very frustrating because the boxing ring rope kept popping out of the holes. Every 4th or 5th time you box and make a lot of movement, the rope comes right off and is tricky for kids, and even an adult, to get back on. It was so annoying, they didn't bother with it. We threw the game out.I had this as a kid and don't remember this problem. Maybe it's the way they make them now. Save your money and get something else!"
1,Rockem' Sockem' Toss 'Em,"Don't buy this. If you do, go ahead and drive it to the landfill, toss the box in unopened, and save your garbage collector the trouble. Santa should have known better."
1,Didnt work,My wife bought this for because I always wanted one as a kid. Very dissapointing! You could hit the chin all day and it wouldnt pop up. Ended selling in a garage sale for a buck. DON'T BUY! It's seems everytime they are doing a classic toy remake it's a piece of junk. Why cant they just use the original molds and stuff?
1,what a disappointment,"I thought this would be great for my twin boys, right up their alley, and it would be . . . if it actually worked. However, it is next to impossible to knock the heads off, which is the whole point of the game. Even the adults who have tried cannot do it. After a while, my kids just give up and shove it back in the closet. Once in a rare while, the blue guy can get the red guy; but truly the red guy can never, and i do mean never, knock the blue guys head off. So what is the point?!?! What a huge waste. When my kids aren't looking, its going in the trash."
3,What a disappointment,"My 4 year old son begged for this for Christmas...they were sold out, ... My 4 year old couldn't really control his robot, and didn't really have enough hand strength anyway. It's only a week after Christmas and already the thing is in a zillion pieces in the play room, never to be played with again. Not worth the money. Not as good as the original!"
4,"Classic game, but box came dented.","Good classic game, nothing wrong with it, but my box came all dented up. Oh well. Still got the game."
2,Size does matter,Wow...I didn't realize they had scaled it down so much. What a bummer. This is NOT the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots game I knew and loved.
2,Not like the original,"When I was 8 I received Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots for Christmas. It came in a big square box already assembled. My father and I played for hours. After I watched The Santa Claus 2, I was inspired to buy this.Bad idea! I had to assemble it, it falls apart easy, just not the same.When it stayed together it was fun for me and my son. Just another nostalgic toy that the modern world ruined.Look for an original.Stephen John BecciaAuthor of The Treelanders"
2,I would pay more for better quality,If only they made this toy better quality I would gladly pay 100 bucks or more to have my kids play something besides video games. I have to limit the video game time because they would play all day if it were up to them. Video games have gotten better but toys like this have gotten worse. I had this as a kid and it did have it's flaws but this type of toy made us use our imaginations. It was fun to play for hours and make up stories. We used to organize entire tournaments because of this toy. Now kids can sit alone for hours playing a video game. I would be happy to pay any price for a better quality version of the original. Maybe some day toy makers will find a market for higher priced better quality toys and then start to make them. Unfortunately this toy is very poor quality.
3,Disappointing,My 8 yr old son wanted this BAD for Christmas but has hardly played with it. My main complaint is the size --it's very small and it really does not work all that well. Both of my boys became bored with this toy very quickly.
1,DON'T BUY THIS TOY! THIS IS A WASTE OF MONEY!,"This was the worse toy I have EVER purchased. I read the reviews ""AFTER"" I purchased this toy. The necks never come up after 20 minutes of punching and sore thumbs! Its made much smaller than the original and badly made! This was horrible. I wish I could get a refund. AMAZON SHOULD STOP SELLING THIS TOY. This is a JOKE!!"
5,A simple and fun boxing game!,"When I purchased for this game I thougt it was a small ""boarding"" game, but it is a big, strong and good quality retro game. Really good for boys and adults, the contenders can move in the ring and it is realy cheap considering the quality."
3,It's fun if you can get the flimsy thing to hold together to play.,"I purchased this for my 8 year old son for Christmas. I bought it for the same reasons that many of the other reviewers did; nostalgia. Well, it's pretty flimsy. Really they can's seem to get close enough to punch to ""knock the head off"". But they do pack a punch to knock the entire body off of the unit. I think superglue or gorilla glue might be in order. It's too sensitive when my son moves the platform about. Once again the entire body falls off the platform.So I guess each person has experience some defect with this toy and it's not as sturdy making it less fun than it should be. My brother, myself and his friends had hours and hours of pretty ruthless play on the original. If you look at it the wrong way, a robot will fall down. That in itself makes my son laugh. So it has some entertainment value for an eight year old.I'd say if you can pick it up somewhere for around $5 it's worth it."
4,Rockem Sockem Robots,These were a big hit on Christmas Day with my grandsons and sons in law. They held boxing tournaments. They created a bit of nostalgia for the dads who had played with them as children.
1,Not Worth The Money!!!!,Do not waste your money on this toy at all!! The robots heads pop-up without even being hit. The robots are always falling off the ring and they aren't that easy to snap back on. It was disappointing to play this game. My kids have given up ont his game and it just sits on the shelf.
1,READ THESE REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING - PLEASE!!!,"I bought this for my kids and can second all of the reviews I read that are disappointed with the game. The blue guy's head NEVER goes up. The robots are always and easily popping off. And yesterday, one of the yellow posts that holds up the white ""rope"" around the boxing ring snapped off and is impossible to fix. It's virtually ruined as no replacements parts are available. GOOD LUCK trying to get any help at the MAttel Website or 1-800 number. I am very disappointed in this product and highly recommend you consider something else. It's a shame because I could see where our whole family would have lots of fun if it worked and was sturdier."
3,VERY DISSAPOINTED,"I loved this as a kid but for some reason Mattel shrunk the size to a ridiculous small size. The robots fall off platform a lot and the heads pop up if you press buttons to hard, it was a good try but fell way short of what it should have been."
2,disapointing,"My wife bought this for me because I've told her so many times how much I loved Rockem Sockem Robots as a kid. I kept it in the box until my own kid was old enough to play with it.The toy is not much as I remember it at all. First of all the robots are smaller and less durable. The robots don't make that cool ""RRrrrRR"" noise when the head pops up and on our game, the head won't hardly pop up at all. We got both robots up as close as possible to each other and even throwing good punches the heads wouldnt come up. I remember on the old one from the 70's if you got in close enough to your opponent to land a good punch in the nose the head would pop up. My kid was bored after about 20 minutes.For those who grew up with this toy and are buying this for your own kid, youre gonna be disapointed. This is NOT the same toy. I was really hoping to recapture a piece of my childhood, no luck though"
2,Disappointing!,My kids want to play the game but the blue guy keeps coming off the base. It is difficult to put him back on. It is a PAIN!
1,I do not like this item,"I was expecting something similar to what I had as a child. I ordered this and when it came I was really disappointed. First off, it is a lot smaller than the real one, a lot more flimsy and doesn't make the signature sound like the old one does when you knock its block off. This may be a cool toy for a little kid that has never had one before, but if you are an adult looking to relive a childhood memory, steer clear, it is not like you remember."
2,Could be a lot of fun if it worked!,"I was so excited to give this toy to my kids after they saw it on Toy Story 2 but sadly, it is horribly constructed and keeps falling apart. The ropes around the ring won't stay connected so they fall and interrupt the game. Also, the boxers keep falling off mid-play making this tpy pretty much a dud."
4,"I knew what I was getting.....So,I was not disappointed. Yea, It's plastic and not well made like the original, but it was $ 20","It's a plastic version of Rock'm Sock'm robots....$20 bucks. Kid wanted it...no complaints. Fair price, quick shipping, he loved it."
1,Not The Same Toy... Why Bother ?,"If the quality is not there, the fun is not there. Basically, it's a cheap imitation sharing the same name as the original toy that's not really worth your time. Truefully, I'd rather pay more, even a lot more, to get the enjoyable toy I loved as a child. I was going to buy this for my son, but I'm glad I read all the reviews. There's not ONE happy customer. They all sit on a shelf now and probably should be in the trash because eventually that's where they'll be, right? It's really a shame. Here's one of the few toys of our past that could possibly compete with the computer for our children's attention, but it's not going to happen. I'm glad I didn't waste my time or money, don't waste yours either !!!! Mattel, your customer's want the original, we'll pay for the original, give us back the original. This cheap imitation SUCKS !!!!"
3,OK inexpensive present,"We just got this toy. I also remember this game from when I was a kid so when my son saw this game and asked for it, I decided to purchase it. My son is very happy with this gift at least for the first morning. Unlike many of the reviews on this game, so far every thing works fine as both boxer's heads do pop up when hit. However, it does look much more cheaply built with some of the effects missing from the original game.However, this is a nice alternative to having just playing games on the xbox or Wii and fun easy game that I can play with my 9 year old son."
2,"Nostalgic fun, but boring soon....","Easy for a child to master, lots of noise and excitement, but play gets old fast and the game soon gets set aside."
2,Don't waste your $!,My son has this toy and the robots constantly fall off and are very hard to get back on. The game usually only lasts about 30 seconds before it's over. Dont' waste your money.
3,rock em sock em robots,"They arrived in a sealed box and it was relatively easy to assemble. They are a bit touchy as far as knocking their block off; however, not any different than I remember as a kid and I bought them for my kids. Great nostalgia! They also seem to come off the base if you wiggle them around too vigorously."
2,Glad I read the reviews first,"I was going to buy this for my husband(and me). I'm glad I read all the reviews first though. It sounds like classic games will never be made to stand up to the originals. I guess you have to buy the original on an auction site somewhere. And let me guess, it's made in CHINA, right? Like *every* toy Americans buy. How lame...."
1,Where shall I begin...,"ah yes, ""Rockem Sockem Robots"" the classic favorite. What a shame. I have no problem with the lack of educational value inherent in this toy-- kids have too much ""educational"" everything shoved down their throats as it is (in my opinion children need to have at least some play that exists for the pure joy of having fun, but I digress). What really gets this toy only one star is the poor quality. This toy is difficult to assemble (I have trouble snapping it together every time it falls apart), which brings me to point 2: it falls apart anytime my boys look at it funny. Worst of all, not even my husband and myself have been able to ""knock"" the head up from either robot. The end result? It looks good on the playroom shelf, but is not good for much else (unless your 7 year old likes to pop the robots off the game to be the bad guys when playing ""Power Rangers"", too...)"
1,Don't waste your money!!!,Some things do not improve with age. This is a piece of garbage. It takes for ever to knock the heads off when my little 5 year old plays. The robots are difficult to set in the slots. It is not even worth a $1 to me.
5,LOOKS RELY GOOD,"I SAW THIS TOY AT ""BIG LOTS"" FOR $15 AND I WAS LIKE DAMN I JUST SPENT $20 FOR IT, BUT WHEN IT CAME IN THE MALE IT WAS THE ORIGINAL THE ONE AT ""BIG LOTS"" HAD ORIGINAL ON THE BOX TO, BUT U CAN JUST TELL THIS ONE I GOT OFF AMAZON WAS THE REAL ORIGINAL!I LIVE IT THANKS AMAZON!"
1,Boring,"I was excited to buy this game for my 5 yr old grandson Tyler. We played with it on Christmas Day. Boy, were we disappointed! It was the most boring game we have ever played!! We even though maybe it would be better for 2 yr old grandson Jackson, but we were wrong. He pushed it away after less than 1 min. What is the point of this game? The heads pop off but that is it! What a waste of money. I should have bought a jack in the box instead. I wish I would have checked into this game before purchasing it."
5,Fun Toy,"I think this is a very fun toy.It has two handles.One red,oneblue.I think this is a toy that everyone would enjoy."
3,"Another entry for a convenient collection of early Ormandy recordings, ALL pirated from original transfers made by other labels",See my review of the same box underOrmandy: Maestro Brillante (Box Set)orOrmandy: Maestro Brillante (Box Set).
3,Dubstar - I Will Be Your Girlfriend,"Hands down, I WILL BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND is the most appealing song about stalking I've heard in a long time. The lyrics almost make it seem humorous! But if you're in the mood for remixes, both Dillon & Dickins and the Sol Brothers give speed garage-influenced dance tracks. SDS Inc., however, goes for digital hip-hop which doesn't really sit well with the vocals. Steve Hillier tries even harder to blend rock elements with electronic pop. But for me, the dark, moody breaks courtesy of the Deadly Avenger go the furthest with the track, turning it creepy. Which, indeed, is what stalking is all about."
2,Terrible Packaging - Damaged Case,"Advertised with a slipcase. The slipcase was broken because the set of 4 books was shipped in a padded envelope! Thankfully, but books survived. This was to be an award to a math student, but it's not as impressive without the case."
5,A Historical Compendium,A wonderful collection of the historical developments in the field of mathematics by the original authors/discoverers without limitation on their original disciplines.
3,ITS A PLACE TO START,"IF YOU HAVE ZERO IDEAS FOR WHAT, HOW,AND WHEN, ITS ALRIGHT.IF YOU HAVE ALREADY DONE SOME HOMEWORK FOR A WHILE SKIP IT."
1,Violent and Disturbing,Normally I like Nora Roberts - she writes great escapist fiction. This book which includes several detailed brutal rapes and a plot line about a woman whose mother disappeared and who then receives pictures of her corpse is not escpaist and entertaining. It's what nightmares are made of.
3,Okay Read,"Sanctuary by Nora Roberts was a fast read. I believe it was meant to be suspenseful but I felt it was quite obvious who the murderer was. As far as romance goes, it was more casual sex. I could not relate to the Hathaway family. The only somewhat likeable member was Brian. I could not feel sympathetic to Jo the main character or many of the characters. I was not moved by this book. I kept hoping for more throughout the book."
2,First real disspointment,"I almost always am entertained by Ms. Robert's books even when they are less than stellar; usually they are a ""pick me up"" kind of read when I'm not feeling like digesting something more viscous. I loved the Sisters trilogy and there are several not far behind those which are genuinely wonderful books. This said, I was ready to put this one down half way through but slogged through to the end which was barely wrapped up in the neat bow and had no interesting after-images of where the characters would go. Some of the characters had promise which just never was developed. The main character is simply unlikeable half of the time and a sorry case the other half.Sorry..........this one just didn't do me well. ""Sanctuary"" wasn't................"
4,Kept me awake all night!,"I love Nora's books because sometimes I just want to sit back, relax and not think very hard. Sanctuary has lots of characters, a few intertwining story lines, and a very creepy rapist-murderer sneaking around. The time I spent inside his head made my skin crawl. The characters are about as deep as a good-sized puddle. So what? If I want deep characters I'll read Dickens. When I want to curl up with a cup of tea and read love scenes that fog up my glasses, Nora usually does the job. This book, like several other recent works by one of my favorite authors, tries to be both romance and thriller at once and while not destined to be a classic in either genre, I thought it was a pretty enjoyable read."
4,great reads!,"There are not too many novels out there that combine murder-mystery with romance, but this is a good one. I could not figure out 'who dunnit' til the end, and I usually have a pretty good idea!This is a dark and mysterious tale, that should be read with all the lights on! Also recommend 'The Reef' and 'Carolina Moon'."
3,"Good start, mediocre ending","The suspense builds pretty quickly which makes for interesting reading in the beginning. However, formulaic romantic couplings soon take the edge off. The ending is altogether too happy - all of the Hathaways will live happily ever after with their newly-found soul mates -- even poor 'ole Dad. A book that begins with a large amount of promising familial discord should try to end with some as well. To have it otherwise makes the reader feel slighted, as if the author doesn't trust the readers to be able to handle an ending which doesn't package up all of the sub-plots in a pretty box topped with a bright red bow."
3,Why so much smoke?,"I enjoyed this book, like all other Nora robert books. However, I have a really big problem with the fact that in every single book that I have read thus far, the main character or characters are big time smokers. Have you ever been next to someone who has just finished a smoke? They smell so bad to a non-smoker, that the thought of kissing as thouroughly as they do in these books, makes me kinda sick! Obviously, this author is a smoker and that is her thing, but why does it have to be mentioned every three or four lines throughout every book? Sorry, but this really bothers me and I am so tired of this that I probably will move on to a new author."
4,"Beautifully written, well-developed",Enjoyed the character development with a nice dose of excitement. Lovely summer reading when looking for some romance.
3,Sanctuary,"As (almost) always with a Nora Roberts book, I found myself quickly caught up in this tale of murder, mystery, and new romance. I felt all of the Hathaway siblings were fairly well fleshed out as characters, although of course Jo Ellen was the book's focus and the most fully developed. I do feel that in this story more than some others the resolution of the story (and the Hathaways' relationships with one another) was too convenient and tidy. I mean you can't live with this kind of non-communication for 20 years and then over the course of a month or two let all those demons go. All 3 siblings had issues that realistically would probably take more than another person's love to solve. But still, getting back to fantasy and not reality, the book was an absorbing and satisfying read."
1,I Hate to Waste Money,"I wanted so much to like this book, but after each chapter I wanted to quit. It was so boring and I didn't even like or relate to most characters. I kept drudging along though, hoping it would pick up and appeal to me, the way Northern Lights did and the way Chesapeake Bay Saga trilogy did, but NOOOOOOO, it didn't happen and after page 200, I walked it down to the ""free table"" of my apartment complex and laid it there.Wasted time, wasted money. Both...huge disappointments. Going to start reading Tami Hoag. I hear her novels really move along, bringing excitement and intrigue. I still have two of Robert's books to try and get through first though ( made a mistake and ordered 3 at the same time ) and hope one or both of them will restore my faith in the writing style of Nora Roberts."
5,Loved it,What can I say.... I loved this book. It had romance and suspense. I would read it again. And I have. :)
4,This is the Nora Roberts I like,"I like Nora Roberts writing - usually. This is one of the good ones. Suspense that out-weighs romance. Excellent character development of all the main characters. This one explores sibling relationships, which, just as in real life can certainly add complications. One mark for me of a good book, is that six months after you read it, you still remember the plot and characters. If you are a Roberts fan, you will love this one. If you are new to her work, this one will turn you into a fan."
4,Lazy story line,"A very familiar story line, and a lazy one at that. Too many characters kept popping out of nowhere, not well connected."
3,casual sex,"I'm aware that most generic Romance novels have a lot of sex in them, and some of the scenes are more tastefully written than others. I think I like it best when those scenes develop after some strong dialogue between the characters which provide a long and excellent build up to the romance scenes. But Nora Roberts seems to jump into them much too quickly. They have nothing to do with caring, let alone love. There's no romance to them, no build up, only instant gratification. And the women seem to be the men's instruments. Kirby, a successful and beautfiul and nice doctor, gets her chain yanked by the idiot Brian. He's a total jerk, totally insecure, and uses Kirby for sex to relieve tension. And she takes it!"
5,Sanctuary,"Sometimes your life just takes that turn that you have an overwhelming need for a Sanctuary. Jo Ellens life was successful and full until the photos started to arrive. One day is just sent her over the edge and back home to Sanctuary. Nathan discovered a horrible truth that he needed to face and went back to the place he had great memories of from his childhood, Sanctuary. Now Jo Ellen and Nathans life have connected on a level neither was prepared for and before they can find any peace they both need to face their paths. Nora Roberts has a mind of a genius to pull these stories out of thin air. Thank the Gods for her wonderful mind!"
2,Disappointed with psychotic turn of the latest novels,"I've enjoyed Nora Roberts' novels and went back to read her older ones too. Lately her novels (with the exception of the MacGregor series) have introduced very dark sides - serial rapists/killers, abusive childhoods. I don't like having my stomach turned when I'm reading to ""escape"". I have friends who love Nora Roberts' novels too and threw away this one since they didn't want it in the house with teenage kids around. I hope she sticks with jewel thieves, etc. or advertises these new ones under a different series name/style. This was a bummer."
2,HATED IT! GAVE IT TO THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT,"SLOW would be a fast word for this book. It was not well developed and I hated the characters in it. Bought in an airport and thought it would amuse me for a long trip. Wished I could have thrown it out the window, but instead gave it to a flight attendant who didn't appear to be very well-read."
5,Fantastic!,"I loved this book so much! Like every other Nora Roberts book I've read, I could not put this down. You will not be dissapointed!"
2,"A lovely place to go, without the characters - please!","The setting on a barrier island off the Atlantic coast is realistic and well done. This is a place I'd love to go! (Feel the sand between your toes; hear the howl of the wind.) The story and the characters are not so imaginative, but fall into the trite category, particularly the ""bodice ripper"" type scenes. And I'm personally not fond of the main character and her cigarettes (smells like an ashtray). Ms. Roberts can write, but her character studies are shallow and not believable."
2,Terrible Ending,"I am a Nora Roberts fan, but this is one of the worst books I have wasted my time on. The first 484 pages were fantastic, I couldn't put the book down. The last two pages did not conclude the story. I kept going back to my book to make sure that I didn't loose any pages or miss something. VERY DISAPPOINTING ENDING. The killer leaves two men (possibly for dead) and goes off to find the woman he has stalked throughout the book. Lives were left in the balance-who dies, who lives, does the killer get caught?"
1,My First and Last Nora Roberts,"Nora Roberts has been recommended to me several times. I came across this book at a library sale and decided, at last, to give Roberts a try. What a disappointment! The locale was the only thing I enjoyed in this novel. The characters were poorly developed, shallow, and very stereotypical. While I enjoy an occasional romance, I do not enjoy page after page after page of people (who have not even developed relationships through dialogue) ripping each others' clothing off for a nice round of animal-like sex. Don't these people have anything else in their lives? Give me a break! I also did not appreciate all of the graphic descriptions of the violence and rape. A good mystery leaves some things to the imagination. I was really hoping to find a new author whose books I could enjoy, but unfortunately, I have no interest at all in this sort of trash."
5,spiderman timepiece,This wristwatch was purchased for a 6 yr old who is thrilled to pieces with his watch. It is his favorite present. He wears it everywhere and tells everyone what time it is.
4,Nice simple case,"This case is working out well for me, it's very minimal, a simple slip case to protect your phone from general abuse in your pocket or in a bag. As long as you're comfortable with no belt clip it's an ideal design (it's easy to pluck the phone out when the moment comes thanks for a tab style area that's been removed from the top of the case)."
1,Not worth the cash,The metal clip is to sharp for the cotton stitching they use to put this together. Mine lasted about 6 months and this included one attempt to repair one side of the clip with nylon thread. It held up fine but the side I didn't re-stitch came loose later.
3,Not A Perfect Solution,This carry case is not a good design for the Panasonic Duramax EB TX-220. For one thing the leather while durable is not seamless and is too thick for the rubber encased Duramax model. The whole idea behind the rubber encased phone is it's durability so why does Panasonic make you buy a case to carry it with? Secondly the case makes it difficult to use the cell phone charger and headset as Panasonic's connector is on the bottom and it does not use the standard 2.5 mm jack. You have to really make sure the adaptors are plugged in securely when it's inside the case. I would suggest that anyone who has the Duramax EB TX-220 model just buy a separate belt clip which will allow you to attach the small notch directly to the back of your phone. The notch is attached by a strong adhesive and the clip is the normal type normally used attach a cell phone to your belt or waist band.
4,Right Case for a great phone,"This case fits the DuraMax phone series perfectly. The optional belt clip is fine, but not reasonable with this case as it comes with a belt-clip already. I find the clip convienece as it allows for easy transport of your phone and offers a higher level of protection of your phone. I prefer to remove the annoying strap and use the belt clip extensively."
4,"A fast-paced, sensual read.","I've never been a fan of the Medieval period, but after reading My Lord Conqueror, Samantha James has got me hooked. Merrick and Alanna are two strong-willed people who butt heads many times throughout the story. He is a Norman who has conquered a Saxon village. She is his Saxon slave. Though Alanna vows to hate him for the rest of her life, and Merrick swears that she will be his slave until he deems otherwise, there is no denying the feelings they have for each other. I like the way the author describes Alanna's feelings of confusion. She is a Saxon who is falling in love with the enemy and she doesn't know what to do. I also like the way the author describes the settings, the clothes and the people's way of life."
3,a nice read,"I liked this book. It did remind me of Kathleen E. Woodiwiss's The Wolf and the Dove but it didn't have the strong character developement that that book had. The hero, Merrick is a Norman Lord who has taken be force the Heroine's home. Alana, is a Saxon who was the former lord's bastard child. She is feared by the villagers because of her dreams that tend to come true. He makes her his mistress despite the fact that she fights him at every turn. She must over come her own feelings of hate to love this conqueror and he must overcome his distrust of her. The story is a good one but I wished the characters had a bit more substance."
4,Good Book,"I liked this book. Some reviewers have stated they felt Alana was fighting Mereck too long in this story. I disagree, I felt the relationship was far more true to the time period than some. Alana's character was great. The characters were well fleshed out. The story, while parts were predictable was very good. I have read a few books by this author, and will definately read more. A promise given is well worth reading also."
3,What kind of conqueror was that??!,"After reading all of the reviews, I was under impression that the book would be something like Brenda Joyce ""Conqueror"", it was not even close to that! Merrick came out looking completely weak and powerless. He couldn't control the villagers or anyone else for that matter, allowing his own people to plot against him. Most of his dialogue was "" I am your lord and conqueror. You will be mine."" But all he did is whine this entire book. The author spend so much time leading to the inevitable sex scene, it was absurd- with all this bathing and sleeping in the nude,by the time they actually did it no one cared! Alana's strange devotion to the same people that hated and abused her all of her life, not to mention her sister that clearly despises her, makes her look incredibly stupid. And why bother giving characters names, if all they called themselves is "" Saxon"" and ""Norman""? If you want a strong hero who is in control, read the ""Conqueror"" by Joyce!"
1,copycat,"The general theme and occurences of this book parallels Brenda Joyce's The Conqueror, but makes a poor job of it. The 'hero' makes empty threats throughout the book and eventually loses the respect of the readers as he began to sound weak with his empty threats. The heroine is made to be a matyr who remains loyal to 'her people' despite their rejection and cruelty to her. She lacks intelligence in that she is unable to judge a person from his actions rather than from the nation of his origin. Throughout the book she makes these petty attempts at 'escaping' but makes no clear plan on how to go about it. The book is most boring and frustrating in that it fails to draw the audience into the emotions of its characters. After a-while you feel that the author has cheated you because of wasted time. The book gives the impression that the author went through the motions of putting in the ingredients and forgetting to mix or add heat. The product lacks chemistry and was a waste of time."
4,fine,"It help clean the hard water out in my dishwater. It did not work as good as I thought it would, but I am sure it had nothing to do with citric acid crystals."
1,Don't buy it.,This file became dull after only 2 weeks. I thought the purpose of a metal file is longevity. I would recommend against purchasing this file.
4,Great book to get you thinking.,"A fun book that gets you thinking. Helps you realize that your job is more than just a job -- it's an integral part of your life. Your attitude towards your job, and what happens while on the job, affects everything. Stories from the fish-mongers' lives illustrate how the right attitude helps deal with everything that life throws at you, and sets you up for success."
1,"GREAT MOVIE, BAD DVD","WHAT A SHAME THAT A GREAT WESTERN HAS BEEN TRANSFERED ON A BADQUALITY DVD. THE QUALITY OF THE DVD IS WORST THAN VHS VIDEOS. THECOLOURS ARE HORRIBLE, THE PICTURE IS GRAINY AND WASHED OUT LIKEA BAD VIDEO TAPE. LOOKS LIKE VCI ENTERTAINMENT MADE THIS DVD FROMA REALLY BAD VHS VIDEO TAPE ON A HOME COMPUTER. HALF THE MOVIE ISJUST PLAIN GREEN AND THE OTHER HALF FADES BETWEEN BLUE AND GREENAND THE PICTURE IS FUZZY AT BEST.DONT BUY THIS DVD, ITS REALLY BAD QUALITY."
1,"WARNING, DON'T BUY IT !!! ... NO ORIGINALS","Amazon should warn their customers about these ""rip offs"". The songs are NOT ORIGINALS, they are performed by some band called ""The Quality Singers"". If you are looking for the originals stay away from them"
4,Worth Buying,Skip the 80's genre recordings and buy this gem of a sampler. Sample and Hold is one of my all-time favorite guilty pleasures.
3,Neil's self-indulgent period compiled,"Although in the early 90's Neil Young was christened the ""Godfather of Grunge"" on the strength of his hard-rocking 70's catalog, most rock fans convieniently forgot that he was a music industry laughingstock in the early 80's. One look at the cover of this CD tells you all you need to know. Taken during his ""Trans"" techno period, Neil could have easily been mistaken for David Byrne of the Talking Heads. Jumping from one misbegotten genre experiment to the next, (techno, rockabilly, country, stax soul) Neil symbolically gave the finger to the fans who had pigeon-holed him as the country rock shaggy-haired bumpkin of ""Harvest"" and ""After The Gold Rush"". The best that can be said for this collection is that it's strikingly eclectic. Consider this an early 80's ""Decade""."
1,dangerous and nonfunctional,"PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS TOY. In addition to what the other reviewer says about the boats not floating (which is correct), the ""finger puppets"" are dangerous. Last night my son got his whole index finger stuck inside of one of the figurines and we had to make a trip to the emergency room. After attempts to get the figurine off with oil, lubricants, water etc, they eventually had to take an xray and then cut it off with a ring cutter, leaving a deep gash all the way around the base of his finger. UNSAFE toy."
3,boats float sidways,"My child loves the finger puppets that are with this toy, but I was really disapointed with the actual boats. They don't stay upright when the critters are placed in them. Who designs a boat that doesn't float?!"
3,Informative,"Difficult to read, but very informative if you have the patience to wade through this gentleman's writings."
3,Instant power supply that delivers,"This recharger, which contains 3300 mAH (>3 times the charge of a regular battery), is a great product.It is compact (at least if you take it out of the plastic it arrives in), has a lot of juice, allows you to use the phone while charging the battery (no need to have a call cut in the middle when the battery dies - charge it while you talk !) and does it's job well.The only problem with this product is that it has no clear advantage over the Instant Power Disposable Battery for Nokia Phones - they both have the same charge and both can be can be closed in an a special bag supplied in the package and reused.This battery has the slight advantage of being usable without turning the phone off while replacing the battery, but it is more complex to operate (connecting the wire, monitoring the charge light, etc) than the other battery (a simple switch)."
4,In Between for Sergio's Career,"This 1971 recording (the first one as Brasil 77) is not as good as his Brasil 66 recordings, and not as good as his later Brasil 77 ones either.Still a couple of songs were instant hits (Pais Tropical) and (Zanzibar).One great thing about this release in particular is the Bonus Track, the Pais Tropical in Japanese, not great, but as rarity is worth the album.His group here:- Sergio Mendes / Piano, Vocals, Arrangements- Laudir de Oliveira / Additional Percussions, Congas- Claudio Slon (after spending great years with Walter Wanderley) / Drums- Dave Grusin / Orchestration- Tom Scott / Orchestration- Oscar Castro-Neves / Guitars- Sebastiao Neto / Bass- Rubens Bassini / Percussions- Gracinha Leporace / Vocals- Karen Phillip / Vocals"
3,Interesting..,"One of Sergio's last A&M LP's, here we find Karen Philipp and Gracinha Laporace dong the vocals and double tracking some solos. What Sergio pretty much did here is give the American singer the American songs to do in English, and the Brazilian Singer songs to do in Portuguese. So you have Karen doing ""Gone Forever"" and Gracinha going ""Tonga"". They are both together on the title song and ""So Many People"". The stand out track, however, is ""After Midnight"" which sounds like only Karen, but I may be wrong. This album certainly is not the fun ""Equinox"" or ""Look Around"" were, but belongs in any SM fan's library."
4,No B.S. For The Bull Cook,"I lost my copy of the ""Bull Cook ..."" book and was reduced to eating beans and cornbread for years 'til I found it on Amazon. The Bull authors have made cooking chores an amazing, fun-filled journey thru history with juicy anecdotes and tasty culinary recipes. This book is deliciously rendered and took me on a nostalgic trip down memory lane. I heartily applaud Amazon for taking me off the couch and into the kitchen."
3,"Entertaining, interesting, dated","Interesting stuff for an old book. If you are willing to take the age of the material with a grain of salt and overlook the then-current restaurant descriptions, there is some interesting historical information and lots of opinionated commentary contained herein."
3,Different Volume,"I ordered this item for my wife, thinking I was buying Volume I of the series. Volume three arrived in excellent condition. Not sure if it was a mistake on my part or the seller's, but I guess I'll have to order Volume One with more specificity. Wifey won't let me send this one back."
5,The Bull Herter Rules!,This is man's book and not for those who wear leotards and balance tea cups on their knees
3,The Tea Party Cookbook,"Face it -- if good ol' George were around today, he'd be a frothing Tea Party spokesman. The difference in his genial, gentlemanly, even charming manner with most of his rabid beliefs shows what's been lost in the intervening years. When he sticks to food, pure food, he's a valuable (if very dated) resource. His ventures into everything else are a sort of entertainment. Except for a couple less-than-entertaining things. There don't seem to be any nonwhite people in his world who aren't, you know, ""natives."" And he did write a crazed marriage-guide book called ""How To Live with a Bitch"" (not pushed much these days, I see) that revealed a pathological fear and loathing of female sexuality. Too dangerous. Must be kept under lock and key at any cost! ANY COST, I tell you!"
4,Fury,"First of all, ""hats off"" to Alpha Video for bringing this series to DVD. For most of us ""baby boomers"" who fondly remember ""Fury"", this is like finding buried treasure. I can only hope that the rest of the episodes will eventually be released. The video transfer is good, considering this series will mark it's 50th anniversary in October (2005). There is a video ""glitch"" in the second episode and some lines in the fourth episode, but this could be an age factor, however it's acceptable. Veteran actor, Denver Pyle (""Dukes Of Hazzard""), appears in the second episode. In the fourth episode, Ken Osmond, (two years before he made Eddie Haskell a household name), makes one of his first appearances in front of the camera. For the price and memories..it's a winner!..and you won't have to go through the trauma of looking at an old TV test pattern before it comes on,... like some of us did so long ago on Saturday mornings."
4,Good memories,"Brought back memories of a simpler era. Refreshing to watch, I loved Fury as a child It was because of him that I am still addicted to horses! I know of many women my age who still have this affliction. (55 ish)I loved watching this again especially because I now own a mare whose great,great uncle is Fury. sighhhhh."
3,Fury-Volume 1 & 2,"Fury: by now with all the reviews pf videos(DVD) i have mostly of Classic TV series- guess you can tell how much I am a fanatic classic tv shows and various types of classic movies(of different genres:comedy,drama,romantic-comedy,historic/biographical dramas,musicals and more). Fury and My Friend Flicka,both Saturday morning-mid-day afternoon 1/2 hr.dramas were most entertaining. Again a TV-Classic that takes me back."
4,Fury: Remastered and complete,"Let me add my thanks to Guido from Berlin for letting us know of the complete FURY from Amazon.de(Germany). Yes. The quality of picture and sound is great and, if you can read German, the notes are also a big plus. I don't know why everyone doesn't purchase a region free player and order world wide! It's easy and the players cost no more than restrictive players. Just scroll down under ""Electronics"" to region free DVD player and the world of entertainment is yours. Many hard-to-find items available, or available at much lower prices can be had from UK(check out the BBC discounts from England!) and Germany.What's wrong with the American DVD manufacturers when Germany beats us to FURY???!!!Again, thanks for the ""heads-up"" Guido!A DVD fan from Washington state(USA)"
3,Poor video quality,The grandkids are enjoying these very much. I was disappointed with the video quality. It seems that it could have been enhanced. The video quality of other programs of this era are much better.
2,Put Put,"The game came in great condition at all, but it's so old it doesn't work on my gfs computer, and it runs on mine but without any sound."
4,The game is great for 6-8 yr olds,"My grandkids play this game and Putt Putt goes to the circus over and over again. They all started playing it when about 5 yrs of age, and they still play it! Yes the graphics are primitive to a degree, but the puzzle is what entrances them. Mom, Dad and Grandparents can also sit and help the little ones with this. In fact, Grandma/Grandpa, try it yourself first! LOL. It's fun."
1,Do you really need this?,"I do not own this product, and I doubt I ever will. I have a 2 1/2 year old son, and expecting another baby any day now, so I know the concerns of parents. But ... will this product *really* make your home safer for your baby? I doubt it. Any product that can make health claims such as this one should be verified by the FDA, in my opinion. This is (I think) a ""feel good"" product (like antibacterial soaps on which I have done scientific research), that have no proven benefit in the home. Personally, I just wash it, and don't worry about the bugs."
1,This Burner is crap,"I bought this burner at best buy for $100. At the time I thought it was a great deal, then I got it home installed it and then discovered why it was $100. It is pure crap it wouldnt burn a dvd-r no matter what I did. So I took it back and got the HP DVD420I for $179 at circuit city and this burner is way better and it was only $80 more and HP is a better brand. So if you're lookin for a burner save your money and buy a good one, Because you do get what you pay for."
3,"Decent burner, software is junk","Ammendment:I bought this dvd burner nearly 2 years ago now. It was a good buy then, and has done me very well. It is extremely slow by todays standards. You can buy something better for $60 now.DVD burner worked pretty well. But if you have a lot of burning to do the software just won't do. Roxio software is just full of bugs. The Easy cd/dvd program works ok, but doesn't have near the options of something like nero. DVD builder sucks in various ways (extremely buggy and very little features), so don't plan on using it to make your own movies. Roxio also has only average customer support. The guys there basically have a list of things to tell you to try, and don't know much more than that. BTW my box only came with a +R and -R and no RW like someone elses came with."
5,WORKS LIKE A CHARM,I picked this burner up after returning the poloroid and memorex dvd burner. Picked up dvd xcopy express and works great for backing up movies. I haven't had any problems. Also have the TDK external dvd burner for the laptop. Roxio is user friend but does not have a lot of features for me. This burner seems to be the best compatible for me. I picked up a 25 pack of FUJIFULM DVD+R and that seems to be the best media out there for this burner and my dvd player.
2,Poor,"As stated by others, dated, holes in the coverage, holes in the analysis, and difficult notation and organization."
2,Waste of money for me and most people.,"Colossal waste of money here. Just 12 tracks, all are at least 30 years old but not one interesting track.I checked my collect and General Public - Tenderness is the only song I don't already have at least 10 times! And guess what: now I have it 10 times.Zero songs of interest. Zero surprises. All these were big hits yes, again 30 years ago. Does anyone need 16 copies of John Parr - St. Elmo's Fire (Man In Motion)?No, no, noSave your money unless you're a sub-teen and have just 3 CD's to your name. For that matter why would you have any CD's? And would you want any 80's music downloads in the first place...not!"
2,US Army Flag Military Gold w/Crest,"Too thin and NOT double sided so if you do fly it the image is 'backwards' on the back side. OK for a wall or other display, but not for outside use."
3,Army Flag with eagle shield,"Lightweight fabric makes this flag suitable for occasional display like Memorial Day, Veterans Day, etc. It is too light for everyday use. However, on those selected days, I proudly display it in recognition of my service to this country."
3,Okay for a wall hanger,This flag is pretty thin and is okay for a wall hanger inside. If I needed one to fly from a flag pole etc it would need to be a lot thicker. In the sun you can see right thru this one.
4,sweet,Flag has nice solid colors but the material is a little flimsy. GO ARMY BEAT NAVY!GOD BLESS ALL OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM AMERICA'S BEST ! This flag displayed shows my appreciation.
5,Great price and Product,LOVE THIS DVD and CD is a bonus! Only complaint is that I wished the CD had it's own case - but still gave it 5 stars for price and product combination.
5,Godsend!,"I'm forty-eight, have been using this product for a month and just ordered more because I don't want to run out. Wow, what a difference in the way I look and feel: smooth skin, no more irritability or hot flashes - even my hair looks fuller. I was considering having my thyroid function tested but whatever was going on seems to have resolved. The cream is relatively inexpensive, easy to apply and unscented. Highly recommended."
5,Natural Estrogen,Natural estrogen product that does not cause all the unwanted side effects of pharmaceutical estrogen.
3,Ultimate Movie Album,"The album production is flawless; however, I believe it's scope should have been reduced in favor of presenting longer excerpts of the sound tracks. Listening to these short pieces is like listening to movie trailers."
5,"Just came across, Amazingly GREAT!","I listened to this CD simply because of the other reveiws on it. I can tell you, they are all right! Its amazing and I usually dont ever go after music in this ""gener"". Whatever you get into you cant help but like it. A NEW FAV!!!! Between the sheets and metropolis!!!!"
3,Good book,"A decent Optics book. Not heavy on derivations, but to each his own. Very dense, great for accompanying another text, but for a first learner, maybe not the best choice."
3,Decent book,This book is pretty well written and really help you understand the materials better. This book is pretty well organized and very easy to follow
2,Introductory text fails to illuminate,"As a student taking optics for the first time this text is rather opaque. It cannot hold a candle to modern physics texts which are full of the illuminating examples this lacks. If you're a teacher looking for a text find something newer. While this text is cheap, course credits are not and a good text makes all the difference."
4,"Decent, economical book for optics","I bought this book while taking an optics course using Hecht's Optics 4th ed. I found Fowler's book to be fairly useful, especially since I got to see optics from two different perspectives. The one really good thing about this book is it's price, and makes it a good reference book. The downside is that since it's quite short, it doesn't cover everything, moves fairly fast, and has no examples. For the price I paid, however, I am quite satisfied."
3,There Are Superior Books!,"This book by G.R. Fowles sufficies for one or two all-nighter studying sessions where a massive review of physical optics is needed.The advantages to the book are that it is concise and attempts to cover a small fraction of the mathematics behind physical optics. Yet, there are some mistakes, such as an incorrect presentation of the forward Fourier Transform in the first chapters.As far as the explanations and motivations for modern theoretical and applied optics, this book does not compare to ""Optiks"" by Born and Wolfe.In essence, the books by Born or Hecht make this book the 'engineers reference' in the world of academia."
4,"Nice, but...","This book is a great refresher, but I find it lacking in readability. It often omits important details, and too quickly comes to mathematical conclusions. It feels almost like an outline.That said, it is a useful reference, especially for the price. However, don't try to learn optics from the ground up with this text."
5,Family Favorite,"This CD has come to the rescue on more than one car ride. It's been the baby's favorite since he was only weeks old, and fortunately the adults enjoy it as well. Beautiful and fun music by musicians true to their Maine roots."
2,rather disappointed,"I give Mr. Critser credit for his writing ability as well as his ability to make and sustain an argument. The book flows like crazy. But that's also where the book breaks down for me. It is a long argument, rather than a painstaking work of investigation. I kept thinking that the author went into this with an axe to grind or some other kind of vendetta, and this book was the result. I also felt at times that he was trying to sensationalize his points, i.e. draw a more inflammatory conclusion than was warranted from the evidence he had at his disposal.Some people may consider it worth reading simply because it's so well written; this will be especially true for the growing numbers of Americans who share Mr. Critser's cynical perspectives on the drug industry. No doubt they'll root him along as he moves from chapter to chapter. For me, I can't justify more than the two stars I've given it."
3,Picture Light,"This picture light is exactly as shown on line and is in our diningroom where we have another painting and light on a different wall.This new one is MUCH lighter weight than our other one, and is also a slightly different shade of brass. It was difficult to insert a bulb It serves our purpose, but I do think our older one is a much better product. I would give it 3 stars."
4,Nice,Nice little picture light. The only thing I wish it did was have the light rotate. Maybe 25 watts as well. Next time q little more power.
2,no response from seller,"The light itself was exactly what I was looking for- however, the bulb burned out in less than an hour. My calls to the customer service number where I have only been able to leave messages have been ignored. I would never purchase from here again."
3,"Too small, not enough light","Product #75052 7"" is not bright enough to light up my entire photograph adequately. I will next time re-order the larger size hoping it will be brighter."
5,new book by well-known author,"This is a major guide to most (all) the known essential oils and at least 50 of their hydrosols.Jeanne Rose is at it again-profiling, illuminating and conversing intimately on her favorite field of herbs and aromatherapy. I missed her personal revelations and fragrant and funny discussions of the plants that are her friends and health keepers,but I truly enjoyed the many essays that are included. She discusses the botany, family, growth habits, therapeutic uses, chemical components and actions of these volatile oils., The hydrosols are described as 21st century aromatherapy-the homeopathy of aromatherapy...""a true synergy of herbalism and aromatherapy. This is another well-written book by this prolific writer who actually uses this gentle healing art. I can't wait to see the reissue of her well-documented The Herbal Body Book..."
5,Excellent Resource Book,"This is an excellent resource for the person who is serious about essential oils. If you take Jeanne Rose's home study course, this book is required reading. Every oil is discussed in detail. The section on hydrasols is interesting."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I was disappointed with this book. I was looking for a book which would give in-depth discussion of the fragrances of various essential oils and perhaps some guidance as to how they can be combined to create new fragrances both for perfumery and aromatherapy purposes. But this book has relatively little on these subjects. If you want brief listings on many essential oils giving: name of plant, family of plant, growth habit, chemical components, aroumatherapy uses, and scent - a lot of information but presented only briefly and not in depth - then you might like the book. I should have been more careful (and used the 'look inside the book' feature) before ordering it and discovering that it wasn't suitable for my purposes."
2,Disappointed,I have been using essential oils in my products for several years now. I was looking to add a nice directory to my bookshelf at my skin care studio for co-workers or clients to look at. I have several books on essential oils and Suzanne Catty's Hydrosol book(which is amazing)I have other resource information from well respected aromatherapists as well. Many of intended uses for skin care in this book differ from all my other sources. Her description of the smells differ from my experience as well as all my books also. There also wasn't enough information on the use of oils on the skin though probably just as well since it doesn't seem like I will ever use this book for anything but knowing the Latin names for each. I may even just send it back.
2,Not what I was looking for. It had a lot of information that I did not need.,"I ususally like this authors books. This book I will probably never use. It had information that I do not need. I like hands on books with informtion, recipes, beauty, health. I like a bit of everything. I did not like this book for myself."
1,Stainless steel.... LAUGHS.... WHAT A JOKE,"Right after first wash, I SEE RUST... great for camping I'd say....Looks nice feels great in my hand but rusted after first wash!!!!!!"
3,ok,"knives got rusty after a few washes, however I liked the cute hanging holder. Overall ok for the price but not the best quality."
1,Damaged my hearing for a day,The previous poster is 100% right about this product. Every time you turn it on the alarm sounds off and it is so ear piercing that I couldn't hear right for the whole day afterwards. It sounded as though I had cotton in my ears or had been subjected to a loud rock concert for hours! Thank God our baby wasn't in the room when I tried to activate it. One can only image what this damage this product would do to your hearing let alone your pet's hearing over time with continued use. Stay far away from this product. I'm suprised they were allowed to put this out.
4,One book you got to read,I really liked this book it was full of suprises! I could not put the book down I even did it for a book report.It was about a couple of of friends who was left behind.They have to face many problems on the way. If your into good books or have a book to do for a book report you have to check this book out for just 5.99!
4,Specialty nibs for correspondence,"I tested them one nib at a time, and found some of rather difficult to write on paper.But the others are really terrific to go on until the ink ebbs out - whee!"
4,Wireless tip of the year,This is a good product for less money and it works but remember to tune it in right and fool with it!!! Takes maybe a week but once you get it tuned right I got over 150 ft reception. Now here is my tip...the headphones are just OK so I got a new Sony wireless 900 MHz RF 945RK hoping it would be better the headphones are but the Sony base does not work as well as the Advent so I just tuned my Sony headphones to the Advent base I get over 300 feet reception and have driven off with headphones on down the street..and they still receive over 300-500 feet amazing.Go with Advent base and Sony headphones ... or at least try it somehow they match well...go figure.SKI
1,Advent wireless Headphones,I have purchased a few items from Advent a set of wireless speakers and wireless headphones I was pleased with both of them.I can't say that for my recent purchase the AW720 The quality is not up to the standards I would expect from Advent.The ear pieces are skimpy and the head band hurts when worn (much to small. Idon't know if there is a larger set availible I didn' see any thing on line.\I am sure I will have to replace the AW720 soon.Gus DettoreP.S. I hope this review gets to Advent as well!!!!
2,Worthless,"From the overly complicated set-up process (you have to tune the base station and the headset to the same channel) to the constant adjustments (there is a bizarre system for maintaining a signal that requires changing volume levels on both the base and the headsets) to the intermittent static, these were a real disappointment.On the other hand, when they actually worked they did sound pretty darn good."
4,Very happy with my Advent AW720 headphones!,"Very happy with this product. I am able to walk through my whole 4 room apartment without missing a word or a song on these quite clear sounding headphones.It took a couple of minutes to tune the transmitter, but after that I never had to retune ."
4,"Great Buy, Cheap Price","I purchased this item to use at night so I don't disturb my wife...It is a great product and has worked great, (although I had to replace the rechargable batteries as they were dead, and wouldn't hold any charge). The reception is good up to 100 feet with line of sight, but only about half of that through a wall. The earpieces are comfortable and provide good sound quality. My only complaint is that after using the set for any length of time the ear pada can become uncomfortable as they are very tight against the ears."
1,Painful to wear,"The headphones work pretty well. I bought them because I already had Advent wireless speakers, and I wouldn't have to set up another transmitter. The sound quality if fine, and I don't have much of a problem tuning the headphones to receive the signal from the stereo. But, after wearing them for few minutes it gets to be painful. They hurt too much to wear them for more than a few minutes at a time, and there is no way to adjust them so that they don't cause pain!"
2,Buy the originals!,"Camouflage are too good a group to buy a Greatest Hits album from.Most of the tracks are strong: stylistically, Camouflage are similar to Depeche Mode. All the more reason to buy the original albums and appreciate the holistic context in which they were first written. Why have one's listening spoiled by a record company's decisions?"
3,Two different sizes for rear sights,"There are two types of rear sights for the Browing Buckmark, older models prior to around 1991 use rear sights that are less than 1 inch long. If you order these sights, they are for newer models with rear sights that are around 1 inch long.The 1/2 inch type are out of stock from the manufacture and they have no idea as to when they will be available.Just be sure to check the size of the rear sight prior to ordering.This is the model number for the older sights:70232 Browning Buckmark .22 front and rear sights. Rear sight length under 1"" long."
2,Not worth the money,"They're OK, but wouldn't buy them again. The rear sight is made sloppy, tighten it up and wont adjust low enough on my buckmark. Factory sent me another, but it was no better. Independent vendor wouldn't publish my less than stellar review, so i wont do business with the again based on their sensored product reviews. Will keep the fron sight, but the original rear sight was far more accurate."
2,Not worth the Money - Limited advantage,"Bought these sights and have to agree with the other person regarding install of rear sight. It is a real pain and you better have the right tools and patience. I ended up having Williams install them. Real nice $35.00 to install, 10 minutes work for their gunsmith. Fire Sights Set Browning Buckmark.On a cloudy day or shooting at a range that has a roof over the shooting bench, these sights are useless. Another negative: The front Fiber Optic is RED.The bulls eye on my targets are RED. So, I can't see the sight when I'm lined up for the bull. Don't waste your money. I've got $90.00 wrapped up in these including install and do better with open sights."
1,Wolo makes low quality products!,"Beware of this low quality horn from Wolo. I installed this into my car as described in the instructions, also kept the horn opening pointing downwards so as to protect it from rain, etc. This horn didn't last more than 3 months. Now it sounds like it's dying and I barely used it. Piece of junk!"
3,good horn for the $$,bought for a motorcycle but not loud enough to make it worth a hr. or so labor messing with wires and possible bracket. has a lower good tone though.
1,not deep deepdish,I thought this was supposed to be 'deep' dish pie pan ... It's no deeper than any normal pie pan.If you're thinking thick pies ... this isn't it !!
2,Scholarly Work Flawed by Few Graphics,"""Sabbath River"" is well researched and well written, but it suffers from the absence of graphics: maps, timelines, and tables. Halkin would better serve his 21st century audience with visuals. Call me intellectually lazy, but I would have been fully on-board this ""great adventure"" had the author used graphics. As it was, I read the first half and thumbed through the latter half-unable to trudge through the details that could have been fleshed-out graphically. For example, in the final chapters much is made of various obscure texts, but these are never put into perspective on a graphic that shows their temporal and spatial context. In another case, the author cites a ""lost,"" then ""found"" will of questionable provenance. I wanted to see the picture of the will-a picture of the will with arrows pointing to all its questionable features. This books is attractive to the curious, but it suffers from an insufficient number of graphics."
4,Entertaining for young and old,"An addictive adventure, the earlier levels of Tomb Raider had us rushing home during our lunch breaks to squeeze in 30 min of playtime. I generally do not like pointless shoot-'em-up games, so I truly enjoyed this one. The game offered good mixture of attention to detail, some movement challenges, and relevant predatory targets. The video inserts are fairly well done, but tedious for younger players. Having enjoyed the early levels, I was a bit disappointed in the Atlantis segment, in which a realistic treasure hunt was replaced with a science fiction adventure. In addition, the ending was a bit anti-climactic. The extra Gold levels, however, gave us something to look forward to when we in fact completed the game. Suitable for kids, you'll be lucky if you can get Dad to stop playing so that you get a chance!"
1,The game crashed on me.,This game crashed on me several times during playing and the sound was virtually non-existant.It did not support my PCIQ64D card. Can't recommend. Disappointing.Also I noted that Lara was very lonely in the game scenario. Hardly any monsters to combat.Nothing.
1,A Beautiful Girl--and nothing else.,"I finally got Tomb Raider on my birthday. I was very happywhen I plugged it into my computer. I started the game... andimmediatly ran into a wall. THE PLAY CONTROL IS HORRID. Lara runs into walls like a stumbling idiot. She won't jump for a full second after you hit the JUMP button, meaning you have to be in the middle of a platform to make sure you jump in time, which is a pain during the timed puzzles. It's impossible to jump diagonally. On top of that, the story is stupid and makes no sense. I lost it when I had to fight the dinosaurs. The only reason such a horrible game has sold so well is because of Lara's body."
3,abbreviated parenting book,"This book is not about spiritual parenting, as the title may suggest. It is about baby development and caring for a baby. It is much like a shorter version of Focus on the Family's baby book. Good for parents who want a readers' digest version of information."
3,Get MARQUEE MOON . . .,"Chopping up a legendary album like MARQUEE MOON is a really bad idea. Best of Television? how about one of the best albums ever? Here's a better idea: Get MARQUEE MOON; if you like it try some solo Verlaine. Also, it's definitely worth getting the MM version with their first single ""Little Johnny Jewel"" added on. Television's second record ADVENTURE is nowhere near as good as MARQUEE MOON. I'd much sooner get THE BLOW UP even though it consists of bootleg recordings."
3,reflective sash,"this sash definitely works as far as being very reflective, however, it seems to ride around some. it isn't too bad and i can usually wriggle it into fitting after several twists. it sort of depends on what type of shirt you are wearing. a little awkward."
2,too small,"This reflective band must be made for kids only, I weigh 240 and am 6 ft. tall and I can barely get it over my shoulder. No adjustment, If you are over 100 lbs. don't buy!"
2,Sizing issue...NOT STATED BY SELLER.,"The manufacturer/seller could do more when it comes to product description - DISAPPOINTED. The absence of sizing was not noticed until the product was received - TOO SMALL to be used by an adult, of any large size, or intending to wear it over outerwear."
1,Disappointing,"Skimpy sash with useless waist belt - who would really want the waist belt? Design would have been more functional if safety is the concern, were the sash wider and hence, more visible. In a word, disappointing."
1,Disappointed,Purchased this reflective sash thinking it similar to the sashes/belts worn by the military during PT...sorely disappointed in its size and fit. Very narrow and very small; if you're a bigger runner (over 6') this isn't the product for you.
3,an alright effort but still wanting,"I'd never heard of Koufax and I (impulsively) bought this CD based solely on hearing the 30-sec samples of the first two tracks. The album sounded good at first, but after about the 4rd or 5th track I found myself bored already. The vocals have a tendency to be monotonous and predictable, the quasi-jazzy moments seem out of place, and lead singer Suchan is always trying to cram too many words in one line and not enough in others. The intros to some songs could get a bit cheesy and I'm still trying to figure out why the electric piano at times sounded like a cheap Casio. I can't say I hate the album, though I can't say I love it either. It's not a CD you can listen to all the way through in one sitting because it can get tedious, but it does have some very good songs that when heard singly stand on their own merits (Let Us Know and Social Life especially)."
5,Brother = Crack Cocaine -- Listen once and you're hooked,"Being a musician I listen to music with a more critical ear. Brother has the sound that any musician would sell his soul to be able to make. Never before has a band with so much soul, tradition, and talent graced my CD player. I gave them a listen at the Scottish games in SoCal and have been hooked ever since. They play in local venues so go see them if you ever get the chance. You'll not regret the experience. You'll hear, live and on the CD, lead vocals and a sound that will make you dance and cry. This group has one of the tightest harmonies ever. Give it a listen, you'll be glad you did."
5,scottish-aussie rock and fantastic,"Have been a big fan of bROthER's since ""Exit from Shreechville"". There music is only getting better. They are very imaginative."
5,play it everyday,"From the first drone of the didgeridoo at the top, to the last strum of the last song ""Carry Me"" ,my whole being is in this album. It covers all their talents. Buy it. Own it. Play it. What can I say other than I had to buy another cd because I wore the first one out!"
5,Employed At Will and Working Day to Day,I'd like to write to the author and tell him that government employees are not as protected as he may think. My co-workers and I were forced out to an early retirement because the Colonel said he could replace us (editors and assistant editors) with kids out of high school cheaper. Since 1996 I have been an At-Will employee and was once fired by the county unfirable employee because she was a bully and she also had talents that could not be classified as clerical.
1,No support from Memorex,Owned this for a short time (2 months) and it stopped working. Have left 3 messages with Memorex and they will not answer my calls.
2,Key Ring breaks to easily,"The part that holds the key ring breaks too easily (break mine within the first week and nearly lost it). Lesson, if you value your data, don't use the key chain thing that comes with it."
3,"Too many peices, they got lost","We bought several of these dolls and the pieces were the first to go. I don't even remember getting a little stereo with it, but they are in the garage bag to be given to charity now."
1,not as shown in picture,"i ordered this item..love dolphins.first time ordering from this company..only to recieve something totally different ! called the company twice,they dont answer their phones! they have not called me back either! sent the company an email..waiting on their response if any to the email.i would not reccommend ordering from this store at this time.i know we all make mistakes but why are you not answering the phones? why are you not calling me back? and why oh why did i recieve the product i now have when it is NOTHING like i ordered online???"
5,A sexy way to exercise!,You don't need to be a workout fanatic to enjoy this DVD. Three attractive couples demonstrate how to turn exercise into erotic playtime. You don't have to have a gym to use these routines... most can be done in a living room or bedroom. We especially liked the suggestions for the pool. I talked my husband into watching this and then trying some of the fun exercises with me. We ended up in the bedroom having even more fun!
4,Beautiful,"Very elegant, moving and beautiful compositions from this Minnesota band. It's hard not to get wrapped up in the sparkling guitars, smooth synth washes and the ethereal voice. ""The Four Corners"" and ""You're It"" are the standouts. Dont' hesitate to hear this."
3,Dabbles in great,"3 1/2The electronic melancholy found here sounds like Owen meets the Junior Boys. There are a few songs that derail into sterility or experimentally stagnate, but for the most part these guys lay it down, placing the often well contrasted vocals over tranquilly challenging rock."
4,Almost perfect!,"This playmat was not my first choice, buy my son loves it. We can leave him on it for almost an hour before he gets tired of it. (He is five months old.) He loves to hit the hanging toys, then roll to the sides to chew on the mat, spin the ball, look in the mirror, and start all over again. The mat had helped him to learn to turn over, as he uses the red supports to push him to his stomach and he also uses it to spin around on his back. There are a few drawbacks, which is why I gave it a four-star rating. The hanging toys come off when pulled fairly easily. I have doubled up the linking rings to make it a little harder for my son, but he has still managed to pull them off the toy. The plastic one hurts him when it hits him. The mat isn't wide enough to be able to change the scenery for my son. It was only made to orient the child two ways. But the big plus for me is that it is machine washable, so when it gets drooled/spit up on, I can easily clean and dry."
5,sooo cute and fun,Love this product! You and child will not be disappointed. Holds attention to my 3 month old. Perfect playgym toy.
5,better than more expensive floor gyms,This was my daughter's favortive place to be prior to sitting up. The motion of the toys really got her attention. We could see her developing motor skills by how she played with this toy. I was sorry to put it away once she got to big to want to lie down under it.
4,Financial Sense,"Ernst and Young's text is a compendium of fatherly financial advice. To most high income investors this book may just be a collection of previously sought advice that one attains by age 50. To the young up and coming professional it is a good source to review each year, especially chapters 3 thru 6. For the young and uninitiated part two should be considered information that requires additional professional advice.No secret to wealth, you will be most satisfied with earning it the old fashioned way with hard work. The same is true of investing."
4,Good Beginners Guide,Good basic guide for beginners using computers and ones more experienced who need to refer to basics occasionally.
3,Get out the magnifying glass,"This book has great information, but the visual aids leave a LOT to be desired. I bought this book for my mom, who wears low magnification reading glasses. The Screen Shots in the book, however, are printed in light greyscale, and she was unable to read them. I do not have any vision problems, and I could only read them with a magnifying glass."
1,THIS AUTHOR IS A PLAGIARIST,"I really regret the fact that Amazon doesn't have a 0 stars option...because it was incredibly hard to ""rate"" this thing at all. I recently found this author's web site during a random web search and found that the following of my COPYRIGHTED writings are posted there and he claims them as his own (having changed a sentence here or there):AOHellAnyone Paying AttentionHateHereticsMagick & KarmaMonkey ShinesPerceptionSurvey SaysWhat If...?I Am a Diving WriterI would be highly surprised if this book is really his own work. I'm in the process of doing some research to find out if the remainder of the writings on his web site are actually his or if he's copied and pasted them from other web sites as well. If so, I intend to notify those authors as well that their work has been stolen. These are the type of people who make me ashamed to call myself ""human."" If my works aren't removed from his site within the next two days, I'm taking legal action!"
4,Great new author,"Having just read a new novel, 'Tales Reborn in Blood by Brian Gardner.' I find this to be the makings of a great author. I enjoyed the whole book, but especially the story called Pigtails as it kept my attention from start to finish."
4,From Out of Nowhere?,"This is the bar band you wished played in your neighbourhood! It's the sort of recording that reminds you that there are so many great musicians out there who should be marquee names. Henderson's blues is a revelation for those who know only his country CDs. Great voice, sensational slide (and harp) playing, and an understanding of the blues that puts some better known 'blues' heroes to shame. Reece Wynans' barrelhouse piano leads an outstanding supporting cast. I don't know if this was played 'live' in the studio, but 'First Blood' certainly sounds like a live band at work. (Footnote: Check out Henderson's version of Sonnyboy Williamson's 'So Sad To be Lonesome' - a spookily accurate impersonation of Peter Green, both vocally and instrumentally.)"
3,good stuff,"It didn't fit very well, but I did force it and it's better now. Not sure if it was the cord's fault or my Vision's fault, but it's better. Pretty awesome stuff, it being interchangable and all."
3,It Works,"Works as advertised. No complaints there. That's the good. Now for the bad...it took WAY too long to arrive. I work overseas and ordered this along with other items. I subsequently placed ANOTHER order and all of the items in THAT order arrived before THIS product arrived. My ""average"" score thus reflects the very long shipping gap from the time since ordering until delivery."
4,Very useful,We lost in the mail the original sync and power adaptor for a Creative Vision M MP3 player. The cost of the orignal adaptor is $15. And this set is more suitable that the part lost. The AC adaptor is very usefull to charge any USB device like a Cell phone.3 pcs USB ActiveSync Charge Kit fits Creative Zen Vision M MP3 Player
3,Bait and switch,"The item that is listed as being for sale is not what was shipped. I ordered an NP-FP50 battery. What I got was a NP-FP70 instead. This may not seem like a big deal, but the battery they send it twice the size and twice the weight. The bottom line, it was not what I ordered.I sent an e-mail to SF Planet stating my case and what I got in return was, ""It is compatible with your camera."" They blamed it on an ""Internet error."" I asked that my purchase be repalced immediately and that's when the truth caem out. ""we don't have any of that battery in stock.I am OK with the battery, but not with SF Planet."
4,Good acid jazz,"Nice album... has a medeski, martin, and wood sound mixed with hip-hop and acid jazz. very good for techno, hip hop, and acid jazz fans."
4,Awesom!!,"I really liked this book, it was off beat and slightly scary but very thought provoking. Not something to read for laughs but it had a happy ending. I loved the characters & the many complex layers of stories within sroties. It might not appeal to some people but it was a good (if serious) read. If you get it, i hope you like it!"
4,Unique,This story is one of the few original stories written in a time when plots seem to be recycled from one author to another. The characters were real: likeable and flawed. The plot was not predictable but satisfying. One of the best reads I've had all year.
2,Slow and not engaging,This book had a hard time keeping my intrest. I had a hard time finishing this book. It never really keeped me engaged in the story
5,Jaws,"I played this game a few times. Once I survived the dangerous waters. A newspaper flapped on the computer screen. That probably meant ""I killed a shark!"" The other times I got killed by hammmerhead and great white sharks. I walk right in front of the great whites to see if I get killed. He always turns and faces me and eats me. Less than 1 second you see the scuba-diver's blood come ot and two sharks are feasting on him. If the great white gets you, in the end you see him going back and forth always opening up his jaws as he faces you. Exellent game."
3,"Great heat and head space, not a good set up","This hair dryer is very strong and has good setting options. It does fit the head even in full jumbo rollers, which isn't easy to find. But if you want to move, you have to figure out how to get the stand to go back up to the position it was in when you sat down, while your arms are behind you and you can't see. Not an easy task. It should stay put, or at least have a latch for this intent. Bad set-up design. But the motorworks are good, and so are the options for settings. The price was reasonable and it would be an excellent purchase if it would stay put."
1,Not What's In The Picture or Description! Poor Quality.,"I ordered this for my 86 year old mother thinking it was the 4 setting control white model with gold and black stickers/lettering that was on the picture. Instead they substituted the newer 1061 Hot Tools 2 setting model with Pink lettering that everyplace else on the internet has for much cheaper than Lil Gift LLC. My mother set it up and turned it on, well, the hot is way too hot and the low is too low, and there is no in between. It is also very cheap construction and difficult for an older person's arthritic hands to adjust.DO NOT ORDER this product from Lil Gift, LLC. They are substituting a cheaper version than what is in the picture. I purchase a lot of stuff on Amazon.com, but this seller has just lost a potential customer. I will be paying a bit more to find a good dryer for my mom, but The Hot Tools pink model 1061 is poor quality."
3,What you get may not be as pictured or described.,"Buyer beware: If you're looking for the heavier-constructed, 4-heat-settings model pictured and described, what you get isn't it. It's the same model number; probably the manufacturer's later, more cheaply constructed replacement. Has high and low speed settings only; heat is quite good at high or low speed, but no temperature choice. Setting the hood for lower angles is difficult; if you set it while standing, then lift the hood to sit under it, you lose your setting. As another reviewer noted, very awkward. It's also pretty loud. It should suffice for now for what I need; we'll see how it works out in the long run."
4,Nice hair dryer,This hair dryer works well but the mechanism to adjust the height of the bonnett needs some improvement. The unit is also a bit flimsy but is overall a good hair dryer.
5,salon helper,"This so far is a very good dryer,only had a couple of weeks like the short drying time in comparison to another hair dryer I had.Good investment,has variable setting and height adjustments"
3,Student Review,"I had to read this book for a class I am attending in college. I, at first had a difficult time reading this book. It seemed to skip around a bit and not really flow consistantly. Once I finally got into reading it, I found it to be interesting. It discussed a variety of topics from Black English to teaching a diverse group of students. I would say that people planning to teach school or parents who have children in schools that are in the middle of larger cities and have lots of diversity should read this book."
3,ok (I guess),"This book is slow in the beginning and some parts of the middle, and preachy towards the end. It's also a long read. I often found myself wondering when was this book going to end. I was turned off by the fact that the star of the book condemned everyone around her their sins and she was guilty of the same things. The only good thing I found was seeing how the star of the book was going to get out of the mess she made for herself. Borrow this book from a friend or check it out at the public library so you won't feel cheated."
4,Yes!!!,"This book shows exactly the type of torment false teaching and not praying can take you through. I could not put this book down. Babe stayed in mess. They story was weaved together wonderfully and it has many surprises. I really enjoyed this book. Here is one lesson I will share, Ladies don't have your girlfriends up in your husbands face... By the time I finished this book, I was thanking God for our relationship. I can't imagin anyone in this big world trying to live without God. For me, it's impossible. The author, at the end did an excellent job of bringing forth the Word. Excellent book!"
4,Fire! Fire! Fire!,These peoples in this book is hot! .. I got to the middle of the book and there was so many people involved then i realize that its because this book is about a lady chronicling her adventures and the peoples are all deadbeats. This book is long but I enjoyed it. Its worth the money. ...
1,Waiting to exit this book!!!!!,"I don't know what the rave reviews were about, this book has horrid! This book actually receives ZERO stars from me."
3,Good Ideas!,Bought this for our tile showroom. Customers enjoy getting ideas from it. I wish there were more photos of projects but any ideas are helpful.
2,Just not what I thought it was,"I ended up returning this book - it was just not what I thought it would be. I was looking for more backsplash layout inspiration. NO PROBLEMS, though with the seller, shipping, etc. I would buy from them again!"
1,You Do-it tile,"Thought I was getting (from the reviews) a book with various designs and tile types. Not so. The best I can say is if you want to do it yourself this book may be of some help, in not forget it."
1,This Book Sucks,"Don't bother buying this book if your professor teaches the 2004 version of the UCC. I spent hours trying to figure out why one of the chapters was so off base with regard to Accomodation Parties; then I realized the book was dealing with the pre-2002 version of the Code. Brook barely acknowledges the 2004 changes except to note that there are, in fact, changes. Gee, thanks."
5,"12"" Hedgehog from Anne Geddes",Perfect transaction. Product shipped fast and packed well. This product was excellent!!! Would buy from them again.Thanks!!
5,Excellent Classic,"I purchased this game before, but the discs were damaged and defective. I was shocked when I found this game for such a cheap price at Amazon. This gave me the benefit of the doubt because I figured I'd have to buy the compete store box version which is much more expensive. The game runs smooth on mose video cards I have used. One computer I had created problems in texture mapping so the world seemed completely coverd in snow. Given this game runs on XP and loot lists along with walkthroughs are avalible online so its a great pick. Some later versions of the Thief series allows user made levels to be availble for download. This might also be compliant with this game. Two thumbs up!"
1,"I'm Blind, I'm Blind!! No, wait, its just the game....","This game is more fun than having a bag of hammers dropped on your head, but not by much. A game where you rely on stealth and not your trigger finger is a good idea but I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. I knew that I was in trouble on the very first mission. It went like this: Me: ""Where am I? Is this a wall or a door? I'll just open it-"" Guard: ""Hey!"" Me: ""Oops!"" Guard kills me. The End.Wow. That was fun. Hoo-boy!"
5,Dark shade,"It is the best game I have ever played, I go back to it time efter time. You can chose to be agressive running and shooting or walk in the shadows through the whole game, and that is mostly the winning approach (but not always)."
5,this poor guy,"this is one of the best and funniest games that i ever played! yea i know it's not meant to be a comedy but it is so funny. i laugh so hard playing this. for one, the things people say. you can stand right in front of a person and they can't see you, all those drunk/high/passed out people, running away and hiding when they do see you and have them kill you if they catch you. oh this poor guy you play. he's such moron and a weak one too. doesn't he have anything else to do besides knocking people over the head and running??"
3,An alright game,"Alright, just about everyone I know said this was one of the best games ever. I've never agreed with them and I do not believe I ever will. The graphics aren't exactly mind blowing nor does the storyline keep you very entertained. You just go, hide, go, hide then run, hide. Not exactly the game to buy if predominately you enjoy shoot em up or fighting games. So save yourself some money and purchase some great games such as Half Life or Resident Evil."
2,"Indeed, Something Tragic","The Brooker/Reid songwriting duo is my favorite of all time. This album, with its puerile spoken suite ""The Worm and the Tree"", marked the absolute low point in the band's history. If you're a Procol Harum completist, try to find this album CHEAP.Good songs are the title cut, Skating On Thin Ice, and Strangers in Space."
2,Procol gone flat.,"This is a most unfortunate recording. What was once a dynamic and creative outfit sounds dulled and uninspired. The drumming, for the first time in their recording history, is devoid of those interesting fills and complex rythms that marked prior recordings. The use of the synthesizer sounds dated. Only Brooker is in fine form as vocalist. The production is also substandard as it comes across quite coldly and sparse, lacking the muscle and density of the three prior recordings(Grand Hotel, Exotic Birds and Fruit, Procol's Ninth). The final cut is a dreadful reciting of a childish poem that is woefully long. Save yourself some money and skip this one. Purchase Grand Hotel and Exotic Birds...and you'll be much happier. Not recommended at all...Simon"
2,I Can't Believe This is Reissued,"Wow, Procol Harum frenzy must be reaching a fever pitch for this album to get reissued. It's really hard to imagine what Gary was thinking with The Worm & the Tree. Really awful. I recently read a review which said that this album may encapsulize why punk was necessary. Perfect. Buy anything and everything by Procol Harum except this album! It does have some novelty value for the sole PH Mick Grabham composition - the Mark of the Claw - which features a pretty outrageous synth solo from Pete Solley."
2,"...So sad to see such emptiness, so sad to see such tears...","Procol Harum were on their way out, in a world beseiged with disco and punk. Chris Copping switched back to bass, and Gary Brooker brought Pete Solley in for the coveted organ role. And Pete even played some synthesizers (BLGH) to attempt to keep Procol in tune with the times, but....no. And having schlockmeisters, Ron & Howie Albert to ""produce"" (heh-heh-heh) ""Something Magic"" ensured its - and the group's - imminent demise. STILL, though: the fourth song, Guitarist Extraordinare Mick Grabham's ""The Mark Of The Claw"" made purching the album worth it. It's a grinding rock and roller, but the astounding solo that Pete Solley plays on the song almost justifies synthesizers' very existence. Go on, you've bought albums and/or CD's for just one song before..."
4,A masterpiece.,This is a great example of the artistic potenial of when a band matures.A nice combination of progressive rock and classical music. The lyrics are both symbolic yet direct. Recommended to all die hard procul harum fans.
5,amazing,"This book should be required for everyone to read, male or female. It will completely change the way you think about feminine sexuality. I cannot believe the concept of a ""rape culture"" is not discussed more often at universities."
3,Truly ONLY For Beginners,"I was extremely disappointed when I purchased this title. While the book is indeed full of wonderful full-color photographs, the actual information in the book is useful only those who really need an introduction to gay life. Otherwise, the sex portion of this book, especially, has absolutely nothing in it that two teen boys with a tiny spark of imagination couldn't come up with. I would not recommend this book to anyone who has ever had sex before, since you've probably done everything that Ford discusses."
2,Glossy and Superficial,Gay sex is so mainstream that banality has set in and the kinds of ordinary books that heterosexuality has been plagued with has entered the gay market. (...).....Men Loving Men would be my preference and it is so much cheaper.....the illustrations in this book are so bland that I ached for the line drawings of other books....all in all this book was so pedestrian in such a high-gloss format that the triumph of form over substance was apparent on every page
2,A MUST that it should be labeled for age-appropirate reading,"I bought this book to read to my granddaughter, age 3 1/2. She has a great vocabulary. However, this book used so many ""big"" words, that I had to stop and keep explaining their meanings. This tends to make it uninteresting and a chore for me to read. This book should have been included a description as to age-appropriate language. I'd say about age 9 or 10. But then,the story becomes too immature for a 9-10 year old. In other words, the language is NOT appropriate age-wise with the contents of the story. So this book was a total waste of $ for me."
5,"I Did It, I'm Sorry",I have loved this and It's a Spoon Not a Shovel since I introduced both to my children many years ago. I use them in my child care center as a way to introduce manners to all age groups.
2,too short to be useful,"Along with ""The Secret,"" tapping energy meridians are useful tools for reaching emotional balance. But this book is too short to really explain the technique; it is concurrently too short and too redundant. Gallo's ""Energy Tapping"" is more helpful with specific guidelines for handling specific issues."
5,Believe the reviews,"This works. It is easy, inexpensive, almost immediate and effective. I bought the book, read it and did what was suggested. It works. No pills, no therapy, no pain and no shame."
3,ok single however no standouts here,"Overall ok single, no bad songs but no real standouts unlike some of the other singles from this album.Twenty years - probably the weaker lead off track on the 4 echolalia singles, good song but not standoutA break from feeding the birds (remix) - very similar to the remix on found on the prick single called prickly, nice ambient remix however a bit long at over 7 minutesA remarkable lack of foresight - another ambient atmospheric song, not bad to just sit back and chill toLike bankrobbers (live) - Not bad, not the greatest song to begin with but the strings sound very nice hereAnchorman (live) - another OK song"
3,Not bad!,"I thought it was easy to use and it loaded easily, never had any problems with it. For the price it is a pretty nice program. Only I am now looking for one with a larger plant data base and alot more like water gardens and such. I think its worth the money. I have mine about 2years and have used it heavily. And it is still not giving me any trouble at all."
1,Burpee 3D for Windows XP - NO!,"I purchased this product which says on the case that it is compatible with XP. When I installed it, it insisted on installing in the root directory. That is a holdover from DOS and a Windows program shouldn't do it. Then it wanted to install QuickTime v2.x, didn't recognize QuickTime v6 and refused to run without the older version. If you have a computer capable of running XP, find something else."
1,Mildly interesting,"Limited Database and cheesy 3d graphics. Nice descriptions of the plants it does have, however. If you're new to gardening and you want to explore shapes and heights, etc, this program is sort of okay. I would much rather start with a great program and grow into it. The problem is that such quality programs consistently cost well over $1,000. Unfortunately I have yet to find anything better in the economy category than this, so if you're going to buy one, it might as well be this one."
1,DON'T even THINK ABOUT buying this one!!,"This software was created in 1995 and updated in 1996, and though it claims to be supported by Windows-XP it will only cause you grief. This gardening software ""requires"" and attempts to install QuickTime v2.1.2 yet won't recognize QuickTime v5 or v6 and as such the gardening program refuses to even startup; I'm not about to abandon a newer version of Quick Time or Windows-XP just for this software (which is worthless to me). It sounds good in the ad, but that's where the good stops. The only good thing about it is if you toss it into the nearest fire or garbage crusher at least you won't be out too much money."
1,Not much there,"This software is not of much use, especially if you are interested in xeriscaping.It may seem cheap but with shipping it does become expensive for what you get. Ideally I would like to buy the Home and Garden Designer software, but only if they had two extra funtions: 1) Ability to modify the database to enter your own plants, be they obscure or modified to your climate etc, and 2) The ability to animate through the seasons or have a garden planner that shows which plants are in bloom and during which weeks."
5,Top Secret Affair,I downloaded this video and the download was done easily - no problems. This is one of my favorite movies and the quality was superb. Would recommend purchasing videos by downloading to anyone.
3,"First 3/4 great, petered out at the end...","First 3/4 great, petered out at the end... It was as if the film ran out of money so the ending was OK but not as satisfying as it might have been if it had goner longer and tied up a few more loose ends."
3,It was just ok,"Movies are somthing that is hard to rate , it depends on what you like .I did not think this was a great movie but that dose not mean it was bad .If you seen it before and liked it then buy it ..Like I said a Movie is personal"
5,Lushly Erotic,I really like the stuff this company produces. It is about The Sacredness of Sex! It is a stroke-by-stroke demonstration about how to massage your Beloved.
2,"Watched it once, but that was it","I watched it once and that was it as the picture quality was not good at all, will not recommend it to anyone."
3,Michelin Switzerland Guide,"This guide is OK. The pictures are nice. It includes a number of hotel and restaurant recommendations, but I think the attractions info is probably the most useful. But, that info is also available free on the net. I wish there was a little more info regarding how to use the trains."
5,The best hair repair ever!!,"I've tried many different hair products, especially because I dye my hair almost every 1 1/2 month, even highlight it from time to time, and I hadn't actually experienced the amazing sensation to leave a product for exactly 60 secs that really worked!!After the first time I tried it, my hair was incredibly soft, and for next three weeks, it has nourished it impressively.I highly recommend it!"
3,Bad copy of RFC,"Let me just compare one sentence from the book and RFC:The book, page 20:Authenticator... In this field, the most important octet is transmitted before any other ...RFC 2865, page 15:Authenticator... The most significant octet is transmitted first. ..."
3,Good to start with a Radius,"Clear documentation on Radius env but you must read another document, most on freeradius, to build a real solutions."
2,Not that great.,"Reading the other reviews of this book I was expecting it to be fantastic. I was disappointed. The book is well written and provides a good overview. However, I was hoping that I could use this book to take me through a fairly complex RADIUS implementation using FreeRADIUS and LDAP. It was not at all adequate in that regard. The configuration examples are sparse and not explained in detail. I was left with a lot of questions about how the RADIUS software actually implements the standard. How user files are parsed, how attribute matching is done, what is actually checked and returned. Things like that were not covered at all. This is a good introduction to RADIUS, but if you have a real project to do you are still going to have to spend a lot of time digging for more info on the web or in poorly written documentation that is available out there. I would call this the best RADIUS book because it is the ONLY RADIUS book."
2,"Acceptable as an intro, but severly lacking details","This book may not be bad for someone looking for a brief overview of the RADIUS protocol (perhaps a manager), but is virtually useless for anything beyond that. The book is poorly organized, severly lacks detail, and has its share of errors. Technical readers should look elsewhere."
4,Radius: Very Impressive Book,"This book is a complete guide. The author explains the inner workings of RADIUS quite clearly. The practical suggestions on setting up freeradius, while basic, are very helpful; plus, it's the only book out there, and it's of typical O'Reilly quality. In closing, this book is very good, in-depth, and handy. I'd recommend it to anyone."
4,Good overview and reference,"I found this book a good reference to RADIUS. While some content is available in the RFCs, it's handy to have it compact and easy to read inside this book. The overview and guide to FreeRADIUS is good to have, especially considering the lack of available documentation from the project. I especially found the security chapter helpful, a candid discussion of where RADIUS fails.While there could be more coverage in this book, I think it's a great one to have available. Recommended."
1,Inaccurate copy of RFCs,This book is an inaccurate and incorrect copy of RFCs with a lot of buzzwords. This should be great only because this is only book about RADIUS protocol in the world. It is better for you to read RFCs if you understand the situation that needs RADIUS.
4,BIG little book,Excellent collection of real recipes from real locals. Captures timeless flavors. Straight format of recipes makes reading and reference very handy. The title is true.
3,DISAPPOINTED,"THIS STORY WAS O.K. I KEPT GETTTING THE CHARACTERS MIXED UP. PERSONALLY, I COULDN'T WAIT TO FINISH THIS BOOK. ONE THING I WILL SAY IS GOD WILL ALWAYS SHOW YOU THE WAY!"
4,Nice for the price,"I really enjoyed this product, and I'm glad I got it despite the other reviews. My only problem was the V-lines on the front (visible in the product picture) that show through tight clothing. I got it to wear under an extremely clingy dress in order to smooth everything out and it works just fine. It's not something that's going to make you two sizes smaller but it works if you want a little confidence in your shape. I'm 5'4'', 130lbs, 29-39 waist-hips and I got the large, although I tend to get mediums and smalls in normal clothing. To people who experience rolling or bumps, I'd recommend going up a size. Most of all, for 20 bucks it's fantastic - honestly I don't want to spend between 60 and 130 dollars to fake that I'm thinner than I am. Just something to wear under clingy dresses, please!"
2,not good,don't like the thigh part is not long enough and it rolls unless you don't pull it all the way up then it gaps between the leg.
2,Beware!!!,"Ok, natually i assumed when i bought this series that it would be great and I admit the quality was very good however, the set is by in no means in any kind of logical order. I found out by searching the net the first episode presented on the first disc is episode 44 or something around there. I distinctly remember the beginning of the series concerning the city of gold not the Beagle Boys running around with Magica to steal Scrooge's #1 Dime. If you are like I am and want complete series and in the proper order, dont buy this ""Collection"" You will be very disappointed. I promptly sold it to someone else for the exact price i bought it for. Disney should have put in more effort and thought into this."
5,Pilot Episodes Likely in Future Release...,"Of course Duck Tales is the best, but I have some info that probably should set everyone at ease about the mysterious ""pilot"" episodes being missing. I have a framed cel in my collection from the episode ""Wrong Way to Ronguary"" and on it the cel says ""Show 25 Scene 310""- not show 2, or 3, etc. By contrast I have an episode from the Castle McDuck episode from Season 1 and it does not have a show and scene listing at all. In other words, the pilot was probably shot/made during season 2, although intended to be the pilot week (thus the Valley of the Golden Suns series should show up on Volume 2). Hope this helps anyone looking forward to this great release!!"
4,ducktales,"I'm really glad they finally released a volume set of ducktales, one of my favorite cartoon shows of all time. I would have been much happier if they had included the first 5 episodes on this DVD set. Does anybody know when the next volume sets are going to be released? I am tired of waiting!"
4,"Great Fun, but a bit scary at times","Our little ones, 5 and 3 years old, love these movies. But there are certain stories that have mummies, ghosts and other scary stuff in it and our 3 year old was a bit scared when watching this the first time.Also, it is not as violence-free as we would have liked it, and frankly, would have expected it for a Disney production. It has a G rating, but you better not let the kids watch it alone.Other than that, it's been on heavy rotation ever since it was delivered ..."
4,Great Show,"This is one of the shows I watched when I was younger, its so good to be able to see them again, the bad thing is that it doesnt come with spanish audio."
3,Duck Tales Review,"I expected the video quality to be better. The sound is also not the best. Overall, it is not a bad deal but what really bothers me is that the episodes (even though they go through the trouble of naming the volume number) are not in sequential order. This kind of defeats the hole purpose of volume number. Spanish is not an audio option on these videos."
5,Brings back memories,"Great qualtiy! Brings back lots of great memories! I bought it for my brother and his new son, and they love it."
4,Episode List for Volume 1,"Disc 11. Send in the Clones2. Sphinx for the Memories3. Where No Duck Has Gone Before4. Armstrong5. Robot Robbers6. Magica's Shadow War7. Master of the Djinni8.

2,I'm almost ready to return this.,"My hands were trembling as I unwrapped this set. I couldn't believe how long I'd waited for this!! I put in the first disc so excited to watch once again how Scrooge comes to bond with his nephews over their hunt for the lost gold ('My gold! My gold!').Words can't describe my disappointment to find the pilot missing from this set. This series shone in it's multi episode mini-movies, and they're NOT INCLUDED!! I'm absolutely appalled that they wouldn't include those in this set. It's pointless without them!I'll probably hang onto it, because it's still such a great show. But buyer beware, if you're looking for the best parts of Ducktales, they're not here."
5,Da-da-da-danger look behind you!,"I could watch this show all day long. There is no doubt that once Disney studios started doing TV shows, none were better than Ducktales. The moment I watched it for the first time, perhaps at around age 4, I fell in love with it. The theme music absolutely gripped me from the get-go, and the adventures they had, coupled with comical antics, were magnificent. I always was bummed when it was over. Now, with restored picture and sound, the show is better than it's ever been. Join Scrooge, Huey, Dewey, Louie, Launchpad, and the rest of the gang for timeless adventure and hilarious antics in DUCKTALES! Whoo-ooh!"
2,Disappointing,"This release was disappointing - mainly because the episodes were not in order and the pilot was missing. Am I happy that they released them at all? Not really. If you are going to do something, do it in excellence. Disney was always about excellence. They've slipped."
5,Ducktales Season 1,It was a great item in great condition for being used. I watched these cartoons when I was young and it was just fun to see them again.
1,"Boy, do I agree with the above review...","I read the above review and I bought the book anyway, mainly because Anatoly Lein did a great job with Sharpen Your Tactics. But this book really is worthless. What Lein does is stop at a point in the game where he thinks it is interesting and you guess the continuation. But then you look at the solution and there is no solution, only how the game continued (or how it should have continued). Apparently this book was the first of a series, but sales were probably so bad the publisher had no reason to continue it. A truly worthless chess puzzle book. Don't buy it."
4,An interesting and instructive book - not for beginners,"In this fine book, Lein shows 200 complex positions from GM play in 1997, and the reader is invited to analyze the position and choose a continuation, as in the typical puzzle book. What is atypical, and seems to have bothered some reviewers, is that the continuations, though tactical, often don't lead to an immediate win. In other words, it's more like real chess. In many cases the result is a small advantage that must then be further exploited, and in other cases the tactic serves to avoid a loss. But Lein always gives the continuation to the end of the game or to a clearly winning position. If you're looking for an ordinary puzzle book for the bus ride to work, this may not be the one for you. Some of the positions may also be too subtle and complex for some readers. But if you're looking for something deeper and highly instructive, you'll find this book valuable, as I have."
4,Very Funny!!,This was a hilarious book and I laughed throughout the whole thing. I think it is meant to be more humorous than an accurate test of personality. I had a lot of fun with this book.
4,fever=bomb 20-speed+vocals,"Fever is a bran-spankin new addition the the Digital Hardcore family. They may not be as fast as their lable mates(EC8OR, Bomb 20, Atari Teenage Riot,etc...) but just as intense. Their rap sytle vocals are all but lost in the confusion of their distorted beats and video game bass line. This duo explains that all rap isn't about stealing 80's songs. A must have for any DHR fan!!!"
4,Afu-Ra - Perverted Monks,"A pretty good album by Afu-Ra. Not my favorite by him but still good. Good beats and lyrics. Has a grimey feel to it, its his style. He has one of the illest flows on the beat. Check this album out for sure. Dont back out, check his shiz out.My Top 51.Backtadacrib2.Doin It3.Understanding4.Make You Wanna5.Sun God (Crazy beat)"
4,Good product,"I recently had a flare-up with red flaky skin around my eyes. I thought it might be from working out--sweat mingling with the styling products in my hair and irritating my skin. I only use premium hair products(Fekkai, Phyto, Davines, Philip B, etc) so I was not too happy that I had to give them up, but I was desperate. Then I did some research on Amazon and found Free and Clear. Well, it didn't help my skin condition, but I was pretty impressed with the products (styling gel and hair spray). The styling gel isn't sticky and gives my hair volume and shine. The hairspray holds nicely, but isn't stiff. I'll probably go back to my old products after I use these up, but I wanted to write this review because Free and Clear products really do a great job on your hair. So if you need hair products without certain chemicals don't be afraid to try Free and Clear--you don't have to give up nice hair for hypoallergenic products--and it might just work for you!!"
4,Free & Clear Hair Spray,This product does wonders for my itchy scalp. I just wish it was a little bit stronger in the hold department. It gets pretty windy here in Vegas.
5,Free & Clear Firm Hold Hair Spray @ Amazon,"For starters, I have allergic reactions to most products that contain the vague term ""fragrance."" With this in mind, I've had a problem finding a hair spray that holds well without making my hair brittle and subject to breaking and splitting ends, but Free & Clear Firm Hold Hair Spray does the trick.It's the only ""fragrance free"" hair spray I have found, that has a good amount of hold (I have very straight, fine hair) but doesn't leave my hair overly sticky, and brittle. I can comb my hair during the course of the day and it will still hold my style.I've used this hairspray in the morning on my way out the door to work and still had my hairstyle holding up into the evening when I've gone out to dinner.I recommend this hairspray for anyone allergy prone, but still looking for a good amount of hold!"
2,alcohol in alcohol free hairspray,"I have for many years used alcohol free hairspray, however recently the brand I had been using was no longer available. I read about several products, and decided on Free and Clear. When I received it I read the ingredients and discovered it contained SD alcohol. I was very disapppointed, but the cost and time to return the item wasn't worth the effort."
1,not good,"Unhappy with this product. Bought it because my ears are sensitive to regular hair spray. May have helped with my ears, but made my hair clumpy, sticky, and straight."
2,Did not care for this product,"I tried this product b/c I have very sensitive skin, and most hairsprays make my face breakout. My face continued to breakout while using the Free and Clear hairspray, plus it did not hold my hair, and I did not like the way it made my hair feel."
2,Has a shelf life,"This product worked well for the first 6 months or so, I use it occasionally when I see a chemically sensitive client. Then used it and it stuck to my hair like glue. I looked like I had bad dandruff and I had to go to the hairdresser to get it out - she couldn't believe it. Would not recommend this product unless they've reformulated it or if you go through it fairly quickly."
2,Cheaply Made,"I understand that you get what you pay for, but this is just awful. I was expecting cheap, thin material, but this flag is beyond defective. The blue portion is skewed and at an angle with the rest of the flag. Also, the white one the left side is virtually see through so you can see the dramatic angle of the blue material. The bottom red strip is also perpetually curled up, making it look thinner than the rest. I am not flying this flag, but hanging it on a wall. I imagine that it would last only a couple of hours if I flew it outside. The only reason I am giving it 2 instead of 1 stars is that it is cheap, so I have to expect some of this. The best comparison I can think of is Halloween costume quality.Although the flag is poor quality, this was delivered very promptly. It was folded and packaged well and fit into a small padded envelope."
4,Edges could've been straighter,"Overall, a pretty good flag for the money. I bought it to use as a wall flag for my dorm room so I don't really care about how thin it is. What's important for me is that the colors don't bleed and the stripes and edges are straight."
1,US Flag,"It is one big piece of Junk! The material isvery thin and he prints colors ran into each other. The bottom line it may b worth the $.01 but not the extra $4.99 fr shipping ad handling.Army, Navy & Military Flags - All Colors & Sizes!"
2,Not too good....,"As posted before, the field of stars is out of dimension, goes half way across the flag. Other than that, it's okay for $4."
1,not so good,"very very thin, and came with one of the rings falling off of the flag ,one strong wind and its gone, get somthing a little more durable."
2,Great deal,"Other flags may be sturdier, but you can't beat it for the price. Allows me to keep fresh, clean spares on hand without breaking the bank."
2,Half a Flag,"Received the order very quickly. However, the flag was printed only on one side of the material. The colors show thru on the non-printed side, but appear washed out. However, since this flag was packaged together with a flag pole I wish I had known that the flag was not fit to be displayed on the pole. Also there was a spot of color bleaching on the star field (blue area of the flag). I guess you get what you pay for."
4,Flags of America,The flags for the price are ok nothing really special but the price is right and if you fly them every day would need to replace every four or five months.
1,out of proportion,the flag is wrong the blue field takes up half of the width of the flag it is very disappointing to get a flag so many have fought for that is just laid out wrong
2,Very Cheap,"This was a cheap flag made in China, with poor printed quality. If I'm not mistaken, the American flag is only supposed to be made in America. Wheres a good class action lawyer when it really matters?"
2,Should have bought a better flag,"The flag was thin walmart grade thin cloth painted stars, stripes, etc. Wish there was a $10 flag that was sewn, where I am located flags only last a couple of weeks."
1,Not Flying Proud,"So I decided to go with a polyester flag as I had read that for high wind areas it was better than nylon....well, I wouldn't suggest this particular flag because it looks cheap. Like REALLY cheap. Its very thin, feels almost like worn out cotton, and the printing is very sloppy, so the colors bleed and the stripes are kind of curved. I'm almost embarrassed to try it on my flag pole! I am hoping from 20ft above it won't look as cheap-o but I fear I wasted 5 bucks....but I suppose what can you expect for 5 bucks right? I would suggest this only if you need something disposable, like for a rally or game...not for flying....."
2,To short...,Low quality fabric but can't complain because of the cheap price. But what made me unhappy is that the flag is not 5x3. It's actually 5x2.75 might not seem like a big deal but I wanted to put this flag next to another flag on my wall but now I cant.
5,Good value,"This flag is a good buy. I have no idea how long it will last, but it has been outside continually for several weeks now."
4,Got what I paid for,"Cheap flag, got what I paid for. I am satisfied. We are decorating our futsal court over at SoccerPlex and we were looking at a low cost alternative to Ebay. These flags fit the bill and fit our budget. Nothing too special but we are happy."
3,"Great price, not great quality","Just put this flag up for the first time, and it is apparent that you really do get what you pay for. This flag was only $4, and it shows. The metal ring fell out when I picked it up, and the material is unbelievably thin. It will work great for hanging up on a wall (which is what I'm doing), but I definitely wouldn't recommend it for outdoor use. The price is great, so I really can't complain too much. One thing that is extremely annoying though, is how large the blue box containing the stars takes up. It is almost half of the length of the flag, and it just looks really funky, because it should only take up about a third of the length. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who wants a very nice looking flag, but if you want a flag for extremely cheap it will fit your needs."
3,A Great Way to Celebrate a Great Country!,"The colors on this work are magnificent! The material is thinner than desired, and the edges started to tear within a week of use. However, it was used as a marker while on a trek, and the damage is understandable!"
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,this flag is supposed to represent the GREATEST country on earth and the makers are at fault as well as the SELLER! $5 is not much to spend but i HATE that i wasted it on a flag with this poor quality. the flag is only printed on one side of the polyester. VERY DISAPPOINTED! i WOULD NOT recommend this product and definitely NOT THE SELLER to anyone. EVER.
3,an okay flag,"The flag is O.K. for hanging on a wall with the exception that it was not designed well with the fact that when you hang the flag, the field of blue must always face the flags right. the side you hang it on according to this rule is more faded than the other and the rings are facing the other side. whoever designed this is pretty dumb... it came with a string coming off and was pretty low quality. If you are purchasing an american flag on Amazon, definately do not go with this one. There is a much better one,American Flag 3'x5' with Brass Grommets - Indoor/Outdoor - All WeatherI would much rather have purchased this flag for a few more bucks than the one I have. Don't buy."
4,Good for the price,"For the price, I wasn't expecting an amazing quality flag. My main use for this was to hang it up in my apartment, which it does a perfect job of. I wouldn't recommend putting this outside, but if you're using it for the price, snag it."
3,A little small,I would have like it to be bigger and a little better quailty. But it is okay. Going to give it as gift
3,Amercian Flag,I guess I didn't realize how flimsy it is....certainly not meant for flying outside! Guess I will go for the more expensive brand next time if there is one.
4,Awesome fitting tribute to Brazil's melody maestro,"This fabulous concert comprises Brazilian melodies, both traditional and those composed by Antonio Carlos Jobim, with the ample talents of Paulo Jobim, Mario Adnet, and many top Brazilian arrangers and musicians. I was lucky enough to witness a live rehearsal of this concert last spring in Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. Very impressive! Lush melodies, orchestral arrangements of depth and complexity, the vocal majesty of Milton Nascimento and many others; all of the above add up to a very satisfying musical experience to anyone who loves the rich tasty delight that is Brazilian music."
5,Antonio Carlos Jobim,The CD exceeded my expectations. It was hard to find since it was produced in Brazil and the liner notes are in Portugese.
5,a christmas stumper,"If your kids are hovering on the brink of giving up on Santa, try this book.....It's entertaining, has some tenderness and humorous magic."
4,Delightful,Enjoyable read and good artwork. The idea of reconciling the disillusionment of Christmas with the desire for the bicycle is great. Love the last page. Of a type for christmas stories that show Santa really is real.
5,One of the most magically wonderful books ever written!!!!,"After reading ""The Polar Express"" by Chris Van Allsburg, I didn't think I would ever find a more enjoyable storybook. I was wrong. This one ranks along side ""Polar..."" as one of the greatest storybooks ever - and not only among Christmas stories. The emotions expressed by the children and adults to whom I have read this book are absolutely fantatstic. If you make it through this book without belly-laughing one minute and crying the next, you just aren't alive!!! If you read any storybook in your entire life for pure enjoyment, READ THIS ONE!!!!!!! If it ever comes out again in hardcover, buy it quick. Its a collectible. If it doesn't, buy it in soft-cover. Its still a collectible!"
5,Be Careful!!,"This is a great book. The message (believe and be grateful) is well delivered. The writing is really funny, the illustrations are lively and hold the attention of the reader.BUT BE CAREFUL! Read this book on your own first, before you read it to your kids on Christmas Eve...because the main character questions whether or not Santa is real, and he does it in a very pre-teen, sarcastic way. It may get kids questioning the whole ""Santa"" idea in the first place, even though in the end Santa is real. However it takes a somewhat mature reader to figure that out.Great book, just read it before you share it with your kids."
5,i still believe,"i firmly believe that had breathed wrote this with adult characters it would not have made the same statement. introduce the child as the main character and it gives us license to bring out the child in us all. the child that was hurt, jaded, and long ago lost the ability to believe in anything magical. i think that is why we pick this up for ourselves and others. i think that is why we stand and cry in the middle of a bookstore. because deep down inside that belief is still there. it just needs to be warmed and nurtured and brought to the surface.of course, this is not the true meaning of christmas. but i believe in a round-a-bout way it is. it is about belief. it is about a feeling. isn't nice that as grown-ups we can still believe?"
5,Red Ranger Came Calling,"This is an AWESOME story for kids and grown-ups alike--for all the right reasons! Berkeley Breathed weaves such a rich and colorful tapestry with his words and the illustrations will make you ""fall on the floor laughing!"" It is a delightful Christmas story about the human experience and one of enlightment without any deep religious undertones. It's old-fashioned in the respect that it has a ""moral."" It's tickles one's fancy because the story is based on an actual ""thing"" that can be visited with wonder and intrigue. I know because my family had to make a ""pilgramage"" years ago to see it with our own eyes!!As a Realtor in the Portland, Oregon, area I make it a habit to give this book to clients every Christmas...whether they have kids or not! You certainly won't be sorry for the purchase and I truly believe you're getting an excellent value for the cost. Enjoy!Leslie NewberryCell: 503-349-2727"
5,This is our favorite Christmas story!,"Without a doubt, Red Ranger Came Calling has become one of our family's favorite Christmas stories. It is now a part of our holiday traditions. The story telling and imagination are unparalleled in any other Christmas story. My husband and I take turns reading to the kids, we all laugh until our bellies ache and tears are streaming down our cheeks. Thank you Berkeley Breathed for the memories!"
5,A Christmas classic in my family,"Every Christmas Eve my father would read ""The Night Before Christmas"" and bible story of Jesus's birth. I was a lovely family tradition, but it needed breath of fresh air.I discovered ""Red Ranger"" in a book store long before I had children and bought it for myself. I read it to anyone who would listen and bought copies for friends and family with children.It's such a magical story - and SO funny! The illustrations alone are hilarious works of art. The end really blew me away.Now my four year old daughter can't wait until Christmas Eve to read it. We read it every night in December. And every night she believes a little bit more."
5,Great Story for ALL ages!!,"Excellent book for children as well as adults. The content brings home the true meaning of the spirit of Christmas. (As far as giving and attitude.) The illustrations are exquisite in detail, and lend to vivid mental imaging. The surprise ending leaves a ""feel-good"" impression that lasts for days. I recommend this book for all households for coffe-table reading and for young children to instill the ""Spirit of Giving"" that is so often lost in today's commercialism of the Holidays."
2,Red Ranger,"Disappointed in book. Read a great review, but was not what I expected. I had planned to use it in my classroom, but will probably give it away."
5,Simply Amazing,"I'm not going to go over the story line - other reviewers have done that already. I will just say BUY THIS BOOK! Read it over and over and over. Read it to yourself, read it to your children, read it to strangers on the street. We live in a world where magical stories are an endangered species. This is a genuine keeper. The ending literally took my breath away, and we're talking about someone who is a hard-hearted, cynical curmudgeon if there ever was one. A truly enchanting experience!"
3,Nice toy but......,"This is a really cute bath toy which my 1 1/2 year old daughter loves. However, I'm not as crazy about it as she is. It is much smaller than it looks. The little sea creatures are about an inch long, and my daughter thinks it's so funny to ""eat"" them, just like the pelican does. They fit entirely in her mouth which is scary. The pelican fills with water in every crack and crevace, and takes forever to drain out. All the water in it makes it really heavy. Too heavy for her to handle. Also, the ""rear"" of the bird has a hole that lets the sea creatures fall out as soon as she (finally) gets them in the mouth. Very discouraging. I have taken the pelican out of the tub and put it away since she doesn't even play with it. I have to watch her like a hawk with the little critters. There is a K's Kids Pelican that is not a bath toy that is the same thing only LARGER and plush. I have this and I think it is a much better toy, and is almost the exact same thing. Get the plush one."
1,maybe mine's broken?,"When we squeeze the handle, the birds mouth closes instead of opens, and when we let go of the button the mouth just half hangs open. so in order for the pelican to fit any of the little guys in his mouth, we basically have to trap them against the edge of the tub with his mouth and shove them in. They also fall out the bottom the very second they are eaten. My kids don't play with this at all, once they discovered the pelicans mouth doesnt open enough to easily eat the toys. I love the colors and think it looks very cute, but it's useless."
1,Dont bother.,"Unfortunately Sony missed the boat with this one. Yes its compact and lightweight, but its performance dosent outweigh its features. First of all, the reception is horrible! If you like listening to static, this is your model. It might be able to perform better outside, but inside, its sucks. Next, the volume dial sits conviently high enough that its gets knocked easily. Switching machines at the gym, and WHAM! your ears are now taking in maxumum volume. I would highly recommend another brand or Sony model."
2,Previous model had a stopwatch,"Such as it is, the walkman works fine, however the previous model had a stopwatch that was extremely handy to measure my running progress. It was a big disappointment when I opened the package and found that this model does not have the stopwatch feature. For almost $50, you should get more than just a radio. Sony has laid an egg with this product."
4,Sony Portable AM/FM,"The product was not the color as in the picture buy grey, the am/fm reception is very average but ok for use in jogging outdoors, no real complaints, delivery was prompt, and I feel I got the product that was ordered"
1,don't waste your money,Lousy reception makes listening very irritating. Plus the too loose volume dial can cause the volume to be painfully loud if it gets accidently knocked.
3,where's the stopwatch,for the most part the unit works ok. I was disappointed that it was advertised as a stopwatch and there is none. The armband is a pain to put on but works ok. Need a belt clip and it would work well.
1,Going down hill fast,"I have owned four SRF-M78s in the past 6 months - no exageration; three have failed. The battery contacts fell out of the first unit after three weeks. Moderate perspiration will cause rust in the battery compartment as it did in my second unit which failed after two months. After the third unit failed I went to the Sony service center. They replaced it but within a week rust began to form on the battery contacts. Failure is inevitable The first Sports Walkman had a rubber gasket which this unit lacks. It also sadly lacks scan capability. Ten presets but only five FM; does anybody need five AM presets. This unit has serious flaws. One of the few Sony Bummers I've ever owned. I'd pay twice the price for the previous the unit. I can not recommend this piece and eagerly await an anticipated ""next model"" when Sony gets enough complaints"
3,Handy for running or the gym,"I have owned this compact AM/FM sports radio for 2 years. It is really handy for running or the gym. The biggest negatives are that it only allows for 10 programmable stations (some other models allow for 20) and that is only 5 for FM and 5 for AM (you'll need more FM in most radio markets) and the reception frequently fades in and out and you have to move the earphones wire around to improve reception. Arm band velcro systems works well even after 2 years. Hold button prevents accidental power-ons when it is stored in a bag. 2 'AAA' batteries offer lots of playing time. Overall, useful, but not perfect."
2,Short lifespan with bad sound,"I bought Sony's sports radio to use when I worked out. I thought it worked great at first but then the unit began to break down. Now, I can barely hear the radion stations or they fade in and out. I've gotten very irritated with how it performs, and I wouldn't recommend this radio unless you want one that has a short lifespan."
2,Weak reception,"Like one of the reviewers of a similar product from Koss, I live in Seattle. Maybe we're doomed by our hills, but I've had lots of trouble with static using this radio. I like other aspects of it, especially the programmable buttons, although it is too easy to bump the button that switches the band between AM and FM."
3,Stupid Battery,"You will find that you often have a dead battery with this product. You will forget to turn it off and your battery will die. Also, there is no ""scan"" on the tuning. You have to manually tune from station to station."
4,Good book,Could have been a little bit better copy. It has some marks and mostly written on the pages. A little hard to read.
4,VERY INTERESTING BOOK,"This book reports on the traditions and obligations surrounding gift exchanges in primitive societies. Very interesting, although the author's style is somewhat stilted. The idea that objects have their own ""personalities"" and ""want"" to be exchanged was intriguing. The obligations surrounding gift exchanges in primitive societies were similar to our current obsession with giving equally valuable Christmas gifts, though much more extensive."
5,Solid,"This is a solid, sturdy, well made mount. I was able to mount the wall bracket to a plaster wall using hollow wall anchors (that I provided). There are several options for mounting the VESA plate to the back of the 24"" LCD monitor--all screws provided. The VESA plate then hangs onto the wall mount and can be secured with 2 screw underneath. It's a very clean look and the front of my Viewsonic monitor ends up being about 2 3/4"" from the wall (the mount is about 1"" + 1 3/4"" deep monitor). You can't get more low profile than that!"
2,Set screws don't set,"I wish I could like this shift knob more because it goes great with the interior of my car, but I had to take it off and go back to stock because the thing just would not stay put! No matter how tight I made the set screws (almost to the point of bending the teeny hex wrench that came with this), they would be loose within days and the shift knob would be loose and spinning around."
5,Yup! It Works,"Bought two clips for my ""eversharp"" brand bullet pens. This clip was actually made for the ""Fisher"" brand"" bullet pen, however a little force with a pair of pliers that I taped up with electrical tape to keep from scratching the clip and it now fits perfect. For some reason ""eversharp"" brand bullet pens never came with a clip and although expensive for such a tiny object it really does increase the usefulness of the pen by 100%. Also there is a really neat pattern engraved on the clip that you can't see from the photo which was a nice surprise. If you have a bullet space pen without a clip then buy one it just works so much better."
5,Down memory lane!!,"What A wonderful job Brenda did with the many Deere items that we have forgotten about.This book is for any tractor collector or people with an interest in the way it used to be will LOVE this book.Plus it has some guide lines on what the items are valued at,good job Brenda thank you.Jack=JDFARM:>)~"
2,too little for to much,this book is not a horrible book it just tries to cover too wide of a subject in to little space it leaves you wanting bad it has pictures with no info on the items in the picture it goes into depth on some items and doesnt even talk about hole segments of others if you have every other book on john deere then go ahead and pick this one up it might have some info you cant find elsewhere other wise get the rest first i was really disappointed
1,Amazon isn't aware of OS compatibility,This software was listed as being compatible with Linux. It isn't. I have ordered other software for Linux that was actually specified as operating only with Windows. Apparently nobody understands software and as a result I have a couple programs purchased from Amazon that totally unusable. I will never purchase software from Amazon.com
5,An excellent resource and book.,"Ms. Thomas did a wonderful job in creating this book about Elizabeth I. I found this book to be incredibly helpful when creating a report. It had me wish I knew this thoughtful and insightful queen. I felt I was in the time period because it had information and facts where other biographers made speculations and mere guesses. In other books, I felt as if the author had not even researched it at all. I would recommend this book to anyone, not just as a resource but also as a free read."
5,Great Read,"I purchased this as a gift for a 12 year old girl, but read it first. It was well written, as well as interesting. Pictorial family tree and photographs were beautiful."
3,Nothing New,"This woman was the greatest monarch England ever had. Ever. The book, however was a bit disapointing. It is a bare-bones just-the-facts telling of a great women's life and didn't near do her justice. I wanted more.If general facts and a fast read are all you want, this book is perfect. Just not for me."
2,slightly dissappointed,"I was excited to get this book, but don't remember in the description when I purchased it, that the pages were coming out of the binding. That was a major bummer. I tried glueing them in, but it's still disappointing."
3,The First Book,"When I was at my city library I was digging through all the children's biographies and came across this book on Elizabeth I. I thought it would be nice to study this ""great"" woman, so I decieded to give this book a try.I did do a good choice. Though it confused me a little bit and was boring in places, I enjoyed it-and it increased my interest in not just Elizabeth, but all royals. I will have to say that another biography on Elizabeth II that I got at the same time was much better for me at the time."
2,Didn't spark my interest,"I was lucky enough to get ""Kameo: Elements of Power"" for free and well... I got what I paid for.After about 20 minutes of gameplay, I was already getting bored and frustrated with the controls & at that point, I just put the game back in its case and it is now collecting dust. When I play a game, I play it for either an enchanting, well-written storyline or for captivating game-play. Sadly, neither storyline nor game-play sparked my interest at all. Not the most horrible Xbox 360 game I own (that little award goes to a steaming pile of unplayability known as ""Alone in the Dark"") but I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone, except maybe children who aren't old enough to play more adult games."
2,This game was frustrating as $%^,"I was so frustrated by the crappy controls on this game that I almost shut it off immediately after starting, however I made it to I think level 2 or 3. My dad played it and liked it until the underwater level and then was so frustrated at trying to control the swimming character that he also gave up. This one went promptly back to gamestop."
2,Nothing more than a shiny ripoff of Zelda,"The graphics are really shiny and clear!The game stinks of too long development cycle and a derivative mindset. I was playing this game on my N64 years ago! Sure it looks pretty, but most of that is the backgrounds. Half the time you spend fighting the camera WHILE you are fighting the bad guys. Major disappointment!Get Call of Duty 2 or Perfect Dark Zero for your 360 instead, you'll thank me"
3,For older children,This game is a little to hard for younger kids. I would say you needed to be at least 13 or older.
2,Next gen graphics with last gen gameplay...,"Tedious boss battles, wonky camera controls, button mashing combat and an annoying ""guide book"" make this game a must miss. Kameo was slated for the original Xbox and it shows, the gameplay is stale and doesn't hold up. By time you hit the under water levels you'll find yourself fighting the controls and the camera more than anything else."
3,Beautiful Game But Too Hard to Control Some Aspects.,My big gripe is how hard it is to control Deep Blue. I went up against a giant squid with DB countless times till I gave up. This game would rate much higher if DB was easier to control and there were no other issues with the game.
3,HM.It's Alright.,"Kameo is a game you begin by going this is alright then you get PO-ED because the gameplay doesn't make sense.It seems to follow suit with Perfect Dark Zero... another microsoft games release. I don't hate this title...it is kind of ""filler"" game when GHOST RECON ADVANCE WARFIGHTER, NEED FOR SPEED MOST WANTED, and FIGHT NIGHT ROUND 3 start to blur your eyes and you need something more tame to play. I recommend this game as a ""Filler"" in which you probably don't want to pay more than 20 bucks."
3,It's ok.,"When I first started playing this, I was having fun. But as the game goes on, it almost gets confusing because you have to keep switching characters and doing this and that with them. Some of the characters outright SUCK and are very difficult to control while others are enjoyable. Overall I would say that it's an okay game to play. Wouldn't pay full price though."
4,Good game for the family,"This is a nice game to add that is more inclusive than other launch titles for younger family members. The graphics are fantastic (especially on a higher quality flat screen) and the controls are easy to learn. The story is engaging and not overly taxing - again allowing for younger members to play and have fun (while not worrying about too much violence though there is plenty of ""fantasy"" violence but it is not overly gruesome)."
3,kameo,"Kameo is an alright game except for the fact that most of the charaters cant jump.Deep blue is a charater that I had trouble controling which was very annoying during a boss battle.The graphics are good,its an ok game I woudnt say its great."
3,"Fun, but.............",My kids finished this game in about 4 days. While it's fun to play and the graphics are terrific I feel that the gameplay isn't challenging enough.
2,"Dangerous for toddlers, Ages 5 & up only","This toy is designed for a toddler due to its small size, but interestly is advertized for ages 5 & up. I now know why. It's a hazard. Pros: toddlers love pushing it & it's realistic looking. Incidents with this toy include: tot's head got stuck between handle bar and main cart, tot's foot got stuck in bottom tray slats, wheels continually got stuck on deck furniture with the gap they have in middle, causing toddler distress. Also, the cart is light weight enough that my boy is compelled to race it along the walls and on top of tables. Finally couldn't take it anymore and threw this toy out today. Get the Little Tikes plastic cart instead (our kids love those at nearby rec center), which I'm going to buy to replace this one. The Little Tikes shopping cart does not have all the openings for kids to get stuck as this one does."
4,Kids Supermarket Shopping Cart,"KIDS SMALL TOY SUPERMARKET GROCERY SHOPPING CART *GREAT GIFT IDEA FOR CHILDREN*My grandsons love this cart because if look exactly like Mommy's at the grocery store. The construction and colors are wonderful, however, it lacks stability and while the swivel wheels are large, they do not turn easily and thus the cart tends to hang up, or fall over. The balance is not all that good when the chile tries to go over a small obstacle. Cart seems to turn over easily."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This is so cheep it falls apart all the time. I am going to replace it with a better shopping cart like the ""Pottery Barn Kids"" one or the ""Mellissa and Doug"". Anything has got to be better than this one!"
2,Kids Shopping Cart,I purchased this shopping cart for my daughter because her other cart broke. I expected this cart to be taller/larger than it is because of the age recommendation. This cart is really a bit short for her (she is 5). She loves to take it to the grocery store and put items in it just like mom. The problem we have at home and the store is the wheels come off every 15 - 20 feet while she is pushing it. We have since quit taking it to the store because the wheel just wouldn't stay on. At home she doesn't play with it as much
3,okay,"It is very reflective, however thin and difficult to see.I walked behind my husband while he was wearing these and I really couldn't see him.Maybe with several lined up together."
3,Easy to use,My wife and I love to walk in the evening. The arm band is super easy to slap on and make our walks safer.
2,One is not enough,"Sure it is reflective, but just one little armband won't do any good. If you are thinking of getting this, get a reflective vest instead."
3,I'll rate its efficacy after vacation!,"Frankly, I am going to Venice and while I know its customary to have a barrage of pigeons around you at St. Marks Square, I am hoping to keep them away. Here's to breaking tradition, and hope fully NO PIGEONS!"
4,It works...,"Nothing to good or bad to say here. It works but if you put 4 bikes on it, you will have a tangled mess like shown in the picture. This can be difficult for dual suspension bikes because they have a little different shape than the standard mountain bikes..."
2,Why the Democrats lost the 2004 election,"This is an odd little ""how to organize"" guide aimed at unrepentant flower-children. Each tip for 'using the Internet' is exemplified by a left wing political activity: the Howard Dean presidential campaign, Michael Moore, MoveOn, and various fringe groups."
4,Why Did She Ever Go?,Mary-Kate leaves Ashley behind at White Oak Academy for girlsand shes so upset.She needs Mary-Kates help and fast! OnMary-Kate's side her friends don't think she's good enough to be in a play and she needs advice from her sister . Ashley's cousin stoll her book reprt and handed in to the Harrlington Academy for Boys english teacher. THIS BOOK WAS GOOD!
4,A great book if you are looking for an easy read!,"I really enjoyed this book! If you like the show Two of a Kind then this is a must read. It is in a diary format and I personally love any book like that. It was very easy to read, nothing to taxing and I just sat on the sofa and read it all through in about an hour. I really enjoyed it and although the reading age was 9-12 and I'm 14 and I thought it could really suit anybody."
3,It was ok!,"I don't think this was the best book in the series. Mary-Kate went back to Chicago because she wanted to be back with her old softball team. Ashley's lonely. Her cousin Jeremy stole her book report and handed it in to his english teacher. Ashley finds out later. She still gets the Harlington for boys and the White Oak Academy's english award, and needs her sister's help to get Jeremy in trouble. This was not the best in the series, but it is still ok for a one time read."
4,Fills in the Background,It took two nights to read but it was worth it. This isn't a book for people demanding a lot of action. This books fills in the background of faerie and I think foreshadows what will be coming. I was disappointed that it was so short and that it will be such a long wait till the next one comes out.
2,Check it out of the library,"Like the subject line says, although I still read these books for the mild entertainment they provide, I don't feel like buying them. Checking them out of the library is a lot cheaper, and I won't have a shelf full of books that are all starting to sound alike with little advance in plot. Very sad, really. I wish Ms. Hamilton would take a hard look at these books and try to retain at least some semblance of plot and characterization. But she has abandoned these in favor or phrase and scene repetition and a bevy of beautiful, horny guards who Anita has sex with but doesn't seem to care about. Sound familiar? Yawn."
3,"Move over, Anne Rice.....","'cause Laurell Hamilton's following what has become your stock-in-trade: little to no plot with steamy sex scenes to ""compensate"" for said lack of plot.That said, I think the Meredith Gentry series is better than Anita Blake. Anita Blake started out with really great plots, and has gone downhill into No-Plot Purgatory. Meredith Gentry is set in a fascinating world with the Seelie and Unseelie courts, treachery, political machinations galore.....and steamy sex scenes. And at least the sex scenes have something to do with the over-all premise: Meredith has to get pregnant by somebody (or some body).As for this book, it's a pretty good entry--it wasn't until about halfway through that I realized we weren't getting to the Seelie Court anytime soon, which annoyed me more than a little--but still, it's a pretty good read.Of course, we're part of the problem--if we'd stop buying these books, maybe Laurell Hamilton would start writing better novels again."
2,What happened?,"I feel so cheated. I am a huge Laurell Hamilton fan. I bought this book the day it came out. The story seemed so good. I love her characters, and her descriptions are so detailed. What happened with the story and plot? I read the last page, and was so dissapointed. It is as if they forgot to print the last few chapters. It just stops and leaves you dangling. What happened?"
2,Really subpar Hamilton,"Listen to the other reviewers. Those of us used to the 600+ pages of the later Anita Blake books are going to feel cheated by the mere 380 pages over about a day in this one.If you took out the sex scenes, I'd bet on less than 150 pages of plot. Too little, too little! Very frustrating. If you took the previous book and this one and released them as one, that would have been alright.The book also ends by just stopping. None of the usual tying up of ends or such -- it just stops. Plus 3 major plot points -- the visit to the goblin court, the visit to the Seelie court, and the liason with Sholto -- are still out there, waiting to happen. It's ok to keep the reader guessing, but this feels like a broken promise.The next book better be 500+ pages and full of actual *plot*, not just ""bloody fertility goddesses""!"
3,You Can't Always Get What You Want,"I no longer rush out the door to buy Laurell K. Hamilton books, but I do eventually buy them. Why read this book when everyone is saying the same thing - lots of sex, no real plot? For the same reason millions of people are going to see the next Star Wars movie 'though they were disatisfied with the pace and plot of the previous two. Because despite the major flaws, Ms. Hamilton is able to create a darkly beautiful engaging world full of darkly beautiful engaging people on a grand scale. And while Merry Gentry can be as annoying as Anita Blake, the men that populate her world are just as yummy. If beautiful men laughing, crying, fighting, and making great love is appealing, then this book (and series) is for you. If you also need a strong fast moving plot, you should look elsewhere."
2,Never thought I'd think sex was so boring...,"Although some of the sex scenes are well-written, I miss the days when Laurell Hamilton thought they were important solely to advance the plot...instead of BEING the plot. If I want to read sex, I'll pick up a collection of Penthouse Letters, thanks. I used to look forward to reading about Anita actually solving mysteries or being slightly worried about her increasing lack of worry whenever she kills somebody, or Merry avoiding most of Faerie instead of becoming intimate with all of it.If you haven't read them yet, try Charlaine Harris' series on vampires (""Dead Until Dark"", etc.) or Mary Janice Davidson's, starting with ""Undead and Unwed"" (this one in particular is hilarious). Laurell should work out her sexual issues with a partner (or two or three, whatever) or a therapist instead of using her fan base."
5,Pain and Pleasure,"Through this fantasy/reality novel comes a fantastic story that is sure to spurn the imagination. The pain, pleasure...the PI who is also a formadable allie in the underworld...so much to this book it is hard to mail down every single piece of wonder this author writes. Laurell Hamilton is an excellent author of spell binding material.recommending: Cravings by Mary Janice Davidson and Fire In The Ice by Katlyn Stewart"
4,Enjoyed the Distraction,"Keep it up Laurie, your storytelling is a great distraction from the real world. don't let the critics get you down. I don't see their names on any covers at the bookstore. Loved the latest Meredith, and once again you've left us hanging as to what comes next."
3,"Not Bad, but not good either","I still think that LKH is great. She wrote the rules on the urban fantasy genre, and for that I give her props. But this does feel like a lot of filler. It didn't help taht I read it straight after Kim Wilkins Autumn Castle, which was really original and packed full of plot. But I'll keep bying LKH I think. If you like her other books you'll probbly like thise one."
1,What the Heck?!?!?!,"I never got this book, I did get a e-mail saying that the book was unavailable, even though I got an e-mail before that one confirming my order, the Amazon website had said the book was for sale on the site!!!! I can't seem to find this book any were and everywhere either says it's not out yet or that its bin out for a while, than later says Ops! We don't have it! So I can't review the actual book because I never got it!"
5,Decadence At It's best,"Decadent, hot and enthralling-who could ask anymore from a book.Full of intrigue and imagination, you can not put this book down. I love the imagery it creates in your mind.Other books to look for: Fire In The Ice by Katlyn Stewart and Men of August Heather's Gift by Lora Leigh (yummy books)"
3,Time goes by so slowly,"Laurell K. Hamilton has proven she can write a book following the three unities.Unity of action: The story revolves around a murder in the sithen, with no real subplots other than the sex, although it might be more truthful to call the sex the main action and the murder the background.Unity of place: The whole book takes place in the confines of the sithen or on the grounds immediately outside it.Unity of time: The whole thing takes place in 24 hours.Good for her. Bad for us. What she fails to realize is that by restricting her novel with such narrow boundaries, it leaves the reader unsatiated, and unsatisfied. Much as I love the series, I felt almost as if I'd wasted my time when I got to the end and said, ""This is it?""This is a book I always read immediately after the third in the series. It is not strong enough to stand on its own."
1,Another Let Down,"I am such a Hamilton fan and so excited when the fourth book came out in this series. HOWEVER, the story line has only moved about 2 days in the last two books. Can we please move on? I realize that writers need to milk this if the books are successful however if the story goes no where then readers will lose interest(i.e. myself and many others who have made comments).In short, this series could have been completed in three big books and after the fourth book we are no where. I'm willing to give this one more chance but if the next book progresses one day then I'm giving up for good."
1,What happened to you Laurell K. Hamilton?,I have read every book she has written and this must be the worst. What ever happened to a plot and a somewhat origional character? Merry is almost the same as as Anita........The book takes place in about a day (just about the same as the last book). Not even the sex in this book was good. This book is basically about a lot of sex in a fairy hallway. I used to be addicted to her books but she just keeps dissapointing me.
4,Rich Characters,"I've read the other reviews posted in regard to missing the plot. The characters are the plot, the interactions between the characters are the plot, and the way they are starting to look upon Merry as a leader, not just an object to get beyond their years of celibacy is an important plot point. Plot doesn't always have to be A + B = C. If it was we'd be bored, as people and as readers.If you don't like racy sex scenes don't read this book. If you love the way LKH writes characters then read this book. It is by no means a piece of literary perfection, it is however perfection for those readers who truly enjoy the characters she's created.LKH is not a standard author so I think it's important to hold her up to her own standards because she delivered when she wrote this book, the characters are growing, and the relationships are improving, and life at the Sithen is getting more and more interesting."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Meredith's Sidhe bodyguards, of all types and flavors are keen to havesex with her as much as possible, as if any of them win the faerie bunin the oven lottery, prestige awaits.Also, it appears that doing so, brings back long unused and dormantpowers from the time when the Sidhe were top dog, not the humans.Apart from this, they have to solve the murder, in public, at a press conference, of two people, and the Sidhe are involved."
4,Merry is back...,"It lets up right were the last Merry Gentry book, Seduced by Moonlight, leaves off. It really just seems like one large novel. It is the same story-people trying to kill her and the people she is close to. On top of that her guards are gaining new powers. It has an interesting plot with meeting new characters too. The book takes place all in a days time roughly. The next book, Mistral's Kiss, also flows right where this one leaves off. Pretty much from Seduced by Moonlight to Mistral's Kiss is just one large novel. All before she goes to the Yule Ball at the Seelie Court too."
1,"Queen of Porn, belongs in a sex shop",Gosh what an awful book. No story just pornography. Not interested in reading any more of her books. What the heck happened?
2,Disappointed and let down...,"I had high hopes for this book, and they pretty much fell flat. There were the beginning threads of a lot of good ideas that just went dangling. This novel felt more like a very drawn-out introduction to the real story, none of the loose ends were tied off, and there were a lot of questions that went unanswered. And, while I've got no objection to the occasional sex scene, it'd be nice to get a few pages of plot in there in between them."
1,Where's the plot?,"I thought A Stroke of Midnight would be a continuation of the previous Merry Gentry novel, Seduced by Moonlight; however, the two days Merry had to heal, ally herself with the sluagh and goblins, and then appear at a banquet at the Seelie court (see the penultimate chapter in Midnight) vanish. Plot continuation from A Stroke of Midnight seems to be discarded; a continual orgy ensues. I enjoy well-developed romance and a soupcon (or more) of sex. I appreciate that Laurell avoids euphemisms for sex and makes it real, but this book just degenetres into (disgusting) sex scene after sex scene. The characters could almost be interchanged with those from the last Anita Blake novel, Incubus Dreams (although that may have been a bit worse), without altering the story.I've been a devoted Laurell K. Hamilton fan for years and am sorry to see her novels devolve so drastically. Her first novel, Nightseer, (a stand-alone) was a gem. Now, sadly, I don't think I'll buy another book by LKH."
1,Time to Move On,"Like many other reviewers, I have been a huge Laurell K. Hamilton fan via the Anita Blake series and the first couple of Merry Gentry novels. However, it appears that Ms. Hamilton is now simply a revenue-generator for her publisher, and her editor has lost interest in making her books interesting and grammatically correct. Both series have devolved into soft core with no plot. Hamilton doesn't even bother to extend the story line past a day or part of a day.Save your money on the newer books. Read the first four or five Anita Blake novels, then move on to fresher, more interesting writers like Charlene Harris."
2,Two and a half stars for half a book,"this was too short, too shallow, and had too much sex (never thought I'd complain about that, but it just got ridiculous). i'm super disapointed because i love lkh so much. better books to read are: Armstron'gs Dimestore Magic, Harris' Dead witch walking, Wilkins' The Autumn Castle. they do lkh better than lkh does now."
3,A read that drags on,There were good events in this book it just took too long to get to them. The whole book felt as if it was dragging on and I think the author meant it to feel that way because of the events that are transpiring around Merry. Overall it was an interesting piece of the series but I hope that the books to come in the series don't take on this slow over detailed tone.
4,A Stroke of Midnight,Caution taken of what you ask for..intrigue mystery? Love and hate sorrow and joy all must be accomplished . Note taken
2,"Boring, Boring, Boring!","I looked forwards to this book coming out, and when the big day finally came, I was the first to purchase it at my local bookstore. However, as I started to read it, I realised that it was nothing but sex over and over again! The plotline sounded promising, but it was done too quickly, and frankly would probably have only been a short story if the sex was omitted. Hamilton seems to have become too obsessed with sex lately, and it's starting to ruin her books. I understand that it's part of the storyline, but if I wanted to read a brainless bodice-ripper I'd go out and buy one. I'm still going to buy her next book, in hopes of her style improving, but I fear that she's sold herself out to the dark side of writing: writing to sell, not to create.For those who have a desire to read books similar to her early works, I recommend Kim Harrison and Kelley Armstrong."
2,A Waste of Money,"I eagerly awaited this book, I can't believe how cheated I feel. LKH needs to get on with the story instead of letting her greed for sales get the better of her.So much of this book was pointless blah, blah, blahing that I literally skipped whole paragraphs trying to find the story. I HATE how wimpy she made Doyle and Frost.I enjoy a good sex scene anytime, but I don't enjoy LKH turning the heroine into a (...). Enough with the screaming orgasms already.I will be very cautious before buying the next book in hard cover.One more thing, LKH needs to get rid of the ardeur in her Anita Blake series. Maybe she should have a big vampire war kill off most of Anita's men. I have lost my respect for her completely."
2,Her stories are getting boring...,"I am a fan of her stories, but she needs to take out a whole bunch of fluff. There is not a lot that happens in the book that could have been in about 200 pages. The only way that I can get through these book, is if I skips paragraphs and pages at a time. I am all for some sex in my books, but come on, Anita and Merry have way too much sex. I don't mind that they have the sex, but I have no desire to read about it. She could do a quick synapsis in a paragraph or so, not 3 or so pages. From now on I will just get the story from my friend Roxanne. She would be able to tell all of the major points in about 10 minutes. Are you getting the point, this book is too long with too little action (except for the sex) which could be toned down as well."
1,Who knew?,This is what I have learned from Stroke of Midnight -- double penetration can be boring. Who knew?
5,Meredith Gentry series,"This series is great! It's the adult version of Harry Potter, Harliquin romance and Mickey Splain all rolled into one. I can't wait for the next novel to come out."
3,"Muddled, but I'm still a fan","This is, in my opinion, the worst of the series. The plot is muddled, with monotonous repitition from previous books -- even within the book, too much explanation of prior events, and the sex is getting really old. I'd like to see Merry wake up and be a little smarter rather than a magical sex puppet. I feel the book felt rushed and used lots of writer's cheats. Still, I am a fan of Ms. Hamilton so I will always buy this series and the Anita Blake books."
2,I don't know if I'm still a fan,"I had loved the Anita Blake series but have grown frustrated with the current level of sexual obsession. What I liked about the early books is Hamilton's ability to weave several storylines together to a satisfying climax. I've never been a great Merry Gentry fan, and this is probably the last book of that series I will buy. I liked the idea of a detective who was also a fairie princess and had anticipated a paranormal mystery. I even liked the court intrigue and the social comments regarding prejudice and alienation. I also liked the great fight against the amoeba of ancient magic. What I didn't like was wading through all the intensely detailed sexual encounters complete with tentacles, and as the books progress the frequency of such is increasing so that it feels like the story line (and advancement thereof) is secondary."
2,I'm not the only one!!,"Finished A Stroke of Midnight recently.... I must say it was better than the previous book, but not by much. I read alot of the other reviews and I'm happy to discover that, no, I'm NOT going crazy! Hamilton's books have been declining. I think she's trying to whip them out so fast she's not really concentrating on the plot. She's losing so much focus. I can see where she wants to go with both series, but at the rate she's going, she won't get there for another 7 books. The unsidhe court is going thru a time warp, but I wish Hamilton didn't feel she had to drag the reader with it!!"
2,It's deja vu all over again,"If you don't feel like actually buying the book but you want to keep up with the story line, here's my suggestion: just read Book 3 again. Because the plot is literally at a stand-still and doesn't advance even one step in this installment. Example:- situation with Cel = nothing happens- situation with Sholto = nothing happens- situation with the goblin twins = nothing happens- situation with the Seelie Court = nothing happens- situation with Merry getting a king = nothing happensetc. etc. etc.Am I pissed off about waiting a year with baited breath for what amounts to an issue of Penthouse Forum? Yes. I'm all for sex scenes, but how about we break some of those scenes up with some actual plot once in awhile. Is that too much to ask? Apparently, it is."
1,Dissapointment!,"As the other reviewers have stated, I also have been a long time Laurell K. Hamilton fan and this book was a HUGE disappointment. There is no plot, many questions are raised and none are answered. It read like a printed political discussion and was, in my opinion, a complete waste of time."
3,kyb,"The last two books that Ms Hamilton has written are testing the edge of my endurance for her work. I have no problem with steamy sex scenes, but when combined with a minimal plot I find myself greatly disappointed. Incubus Dreams was more than I could take and I just skipped to the end. Stroke of Midnight started with a bang, but fizzled out. At least it only took 300+ pages instead of nearly 1000! However, I don't think that this is entirely her fault. I always checked her blog while she was writing SOM and from comments she made I am certain that it was so large that her editor decided to cut it into 2 books, which was sad for all concerned. I am hoping she is going somewhere with all of this since she's always been one of my favorite authors and am taking a wait-an-see attitude. If she doesn't revert to previous greatness, I still appreciate the ride!"
4,Twelve Strokes too long,"I enjoyed this as well as the other Gentry Novels, however, it dragged on a bit too long. Some of the story lines from the past book was just left off completely. I was expecting them to pick up in this book, but instead whole new concepts were introduced making the whole sega confusing. I understand the next book (Minstrel's Kiss) is pretty much a repeat of Stroke, so not looking forward to it, but I'm going to read it just the same. I'm ready for Meredith to finally resolve a few things, then move on, and then get into some new and exciting action!!!"
3,"A little more plot development, please","I've been amused to note how many of the reviewers of this book complain about the amount of sex, since I read Laurell Hamilton's novels *for* the sex.However, as much as I enjoy the sex scenes, I originally began reading the Merry Gentry books because I was hooked by the characters and the story. ""Stroke of Midnight"" was a disappointment precisely because the main storyline doesn't advance. We learn nothing more of significance about what Cel is doing or about why Merry's power is growing. Most of the scenes that were not sex scenes felt like padding, or marking time. I hope ""Mistral's Kiss"" does much better in this regard."
3,"Less political descriptions, but too much other...","This was another ""just okay"" for me. The long political descriptions were mostly gone in this one (yay!), but there were spots of very long dialogue marathons that really slowed down the action. In some instances, an action scene (or sex scene) began, and became broken up with so much dialogue that the action didn't resume until several chapters later. The whole story occurred over a day or two, making it an awkward read - it just didn't work as well as it would've if it was plotted with a better timeline. I'll keep reading the series out of curiosity, but I hope it will improve."
3,A Stroke of Midnight,"Interesting and inventive plot. I don't mind explicit sex in a book, however, the sex scenes seemed to go on and on. The sex is a necessary ingredient to the premise of the book's basic plot. It was just that the very detailed (and lengthy) descriptions of the physical sensations that every movement and body part created,was a bit tediousThere is an underlying basic plot that runs through the series of books which is truly interesting. It involves the main character, who is a fairy princess, and her struggle to bring back the lands and negotiate the fairy court on the trek to become queen.My complaint is that if the laborious sex scenes were removed the book would only have been a chapter or two in the overall story."
1,Completely unsatisfied,"Just finished the book 10 minutes ago and I have to add on to the other reviews that were also disappointed with this installment of the MG series.I can't find fault with the sex scenes but what makes this a great series is the political negotiation, the subplots and the rich character development. All these were missing from ""A Stroke of Midnight"".I would seriously read all reviews of Book 5 - ""Mistral's Kiss"" before even considering reading the next book myself. If it doesn't rate a minimum of 4 stars, I will probably give it a miss and drop LKH from my preferred authors list."
1,the reader is annoying,"I slammed the last book for changing the pronunciation of names because it was jarring to the listener. I removed 2 stars. This time I am removing 4 stars. The name pronunciation stayed the same but an accent was added to Doyle/Dole/whatever his name is, since it changes...In the previous book there is a section where the author literally (and I mean literally) states that Doyle has no accent and Meredith had never heard it before, until he was stressed out or excited or something... I don't recall what it was, I think it was when he changed into an animal for the first time in centuries. Then the accent goes away as he gets back his control - again, specifically stated by the author. This novel, has him using the accent constantly and it drives me nuts. The reader is the same as the last novel so there shouldn't even be the excuse that she didn't know. Take some pride in your work. yeesh."
1,Actually deleted this from my Kindle mid-book.,Everyone else pretty much summed this book up. Sex. So no longer is the book about anything actually interesting. I thought it would be an interesting book but it wasn't. LKH is no longer an author I will be paying to read. Her books are all the same a woman feels the need to be a complete tramp the entire time and blames it all on something she can not control. PATHETIC!
2,"Incredibly frustrating. Laurell, you are testing my patience.","I was incredibly disappointed with this novel. The story moved absolutely nowhere. I keep going back to Ms. Hamilton for my faerie-fix, and I enjoyed her third book in the series, even though there was so much sex even I found it harder to swallow (no pun intended). When I bought the fourth installment of her series, I expected her to take a break from the gratuitous sex and maybe let the plotline develop....for example, LET HER GO TO THE SEELIE COURT! But instead, not only does she do more of the same, she decides to make all 300-plus pages about one 24 hour period! I literally screamed in frustration. Sure, some cool goddess manifestations happen, but sheez. To me, it almost seemed like she didn't know where to go with the story, so she just threw more sex in. Ms Hamilton: You tried a new method. We are not amused. PLEASE get back to the plot. And give Doyle's character more pages. He's the best guard *smirk*."
2,Get on with the story already,"I loved this series first couple of books...but Anita and Meredith are going in the same direction Sex, Sex, and more sex, the story is dead last.I love the sex in her books but this one was so over whelming with sex that it got boring. I was listening to it on CD for a 4 hour trip and it was putting me to sleep, which her books have never done in the past.It was easy to tell what was going to happen most of the time and there was no mystery...Not to mention that she changed some of the facts. I double checked and in the last book she had healed Reese's eye, but in this on he was back to being blinded and disfigured.LKH should get back to writing the really great books like Circus of the Dammed, Obsidian Butter Fly, A Kiss of Shadows, and A Caress of Twilight."
3,2nd half of book gets better,The first half of Seduced by Moonlight is a snoozer but the story picks up when Meredith returns to the Unseelie Court. I almost stopped reading the book but pushed through because I want to read the wholes series. I hope the next book is better.
2,A Review For A Stroke Of Midnight,"I think that this book carried on longer than it should. A good chuknk could've been cut out of this, and one sex scene was a little over the top and completely unrealistic. A lot of the scenes in this book seem to drag pointlessly on and on and on, like the descriptions for example. It would go from someone's hair, to their eyes, how the color of their eyes or hair contrasted with other colors. The it would go to another person's eyes and hair and how those contrasted with other colors. This book started off really well with the press conference, and finding out about the murders...but then the murders kinda get dropped for the rest of the book until the last chapter they get brought up again. I seriously think this book could've been written better. I almost considered not finishing it because the chapters carried on way too long. I did like, however how the different little things ths sithen did for Meredith helped with the story later as the book drug on and on."
5,Great Addition to Merry-verse,"I absolutely loved this book. The reader is given more insight into the Sidhe world, and the newer characters are intriguing. I only had a couple of problems with this book.1. The infamous 3 chapters long sex scene. A little on the boring side.2. The book just wasn't long enough.Ater the disaster that was ID, I must admit I was a little scared to read this book. I love Merry and her Merry Men so much, I didn't want to start hating them like I did in the world of Anita. Well, LKH has gotten back on track (here's hoping she stays there) with this book. If you love Merry, Doyle, Frost, and all the other hunks of Fairie, you'll enjoy this book."
4,"Good, but moving too slowly","I can't tell you how long I have waited for this book- and it was well worth the wait. However, the pace is moving a little too slowly for my taste. This book encompasses just one day and 2 nights of nonstop action in the Unseelie court. Granted, a lot happens, but not very much that moves the plot along.I did enjoy delving deeper into the emotions of Frost and Doyle and Galen makes great strides, but Merry seems to spend all her time on her back and that gets just a little repetitive. During the time span of the book, I think I counted her having sex 12 times, which seems a little excessive to me. I would really like it if the plot progressed at a similar pace, but we basically ended up where we started.Please, Ms Hamilton, if you are going to move the plot this slowly don't make us wait so long between books."
1,Avoid this book.,"I browse through the Hamilton books of late. I can't bring myself to pay for such drivel. If I can't find anything but sex and stupidity, I put it back on the shelf.I haven't bought any of her last four books. Laurell Hamilton: the John Norman for the Seelie Court."
2,I thought we have evolved past this in Society.,"This book is a disgrace, it is everything that is wrong with America. Mayhem, imoral behavior and chaos are not entertaining. The author is a cave man with a a good vocabulary. He seems to think that being a brute, beating people up, and being sexually reckless are entertaining. The other thing that sucks about this book other then all the angry white man attitude and violence, is that the reader is subjected to Mr. Tenaglia's warped views on art and politics (He is and out of work actor, he hates the Democrats and the Republicans, and he can't stand organized religion). If half of what goes on in this book is true, (and from the amount of fine detail given,it must be) then the writer needs to be put in jail for a number of crimes and civil rights violations, or at the very least given therapy. Any progressive thinking christian person will be offended by this, don't give your money to this ""Anarchist"""
5,I read this book in 2 days,"I have not read a book this good in a while, it was easy to read and yet so poetic. I highly recomend this book. I read 30-40 books a year and this was the best book I have read in YEARS. I can only describe it as ROCK AND ROLL with fistfights, love, loss, poetry, and one young mans quest for personal freedom. -Fred Press"
4,A different Greenwich Village,"Michael Tenaglia's new book is a quick paced fasinating story of one mans classic journey from the fringe of NYC culture to the center of the action.The narritive style is fresh and brutal,without apology,the more violent the circunstance the more sympathetic the characters and the funnier the outcome of a particular adventure ( the bar brawl between our hero and the bridesmaids,then joined by the bride,is the best funny/horrible encounter since the heyday of Hunter Thompson's flights of fancy}. The author has also adopted a facinating theatrical technique (called""in one""},where the action freezes and our hero addresses the audience directly .Though sometimes the instrument is rough it is a great device and once honed by the writer may well be his great contribution to literature. A quick read ANTI-HERO is a wonderful debut and a must peek for those in the know as Mr.Tenaglia's star as an actor rises quickly."
3,UM. WHAT?,"Perfect Dark Zero is a game you begin by going this is alright then you get PO-ED because the gameplay doesn't make sense.It seems to follow suit with KAMEO... another microsoft games release. I don't hate this title...it is kind of ""filler"" game when GHOST RECON ADVANCE WARFIGHTER, NEED FOR SPEED MOST WANTED, and FIGHT NIGHT ROUND 3 start to blur your eyes and you need something more tame to play. I recommend this game as a ""Filler"" in which you probably don't want to pay more than 20 bucks."
2,so outdated now,"It's amazing to read reviews from 2005-2006 saying how this game has great graphics, it's 2008 now and this game looks so simplistic and outdated. hard to enjoy playing a shooter game with such outdated graphics when there are games like bioshock and gears of war, this game looks like a ps2 game in comparison."
2,Moronic at best,"This is a mostly dumb game. If you can find it in a bargain bin then it may be worth the investment. I like First Person Shooters, and was looking forward to this one. However, I found it to be rather lame. The graphics are only so-so. Voice acting is terrible. You can only hold at most three weapons at one time.Some of the levels are actually much better than others, so it isn't all bad. Also, it is fun to play deathmatch. However, I have only been able to get four levels on deathmatch.You can play with 15 bots which is fun. Also there are some hovercraft thingees that are neat and don't run out of ammo.All in all, I am glad that the games on the 360 have improved. If this was my first game I would probably trade in my 360 for something else. I would suggest playing other games first and wait for this title to go down further in price.What I'd pay: $5.00 or less."
1,Perfect Dark N64 was way better,"First off, its almost 2008, and I just bought this game. I bought it because it was so cheap that it was practically free. Good thing too, it sucks!Xbox 360 games now have graphics that totally blow this game out of the water. The AI is a joke, and the controls are, well, its hard to describe but basically they suck. It just doesn't feel right.The biggest disappoint I have is that this game taints my wonderful memories of PD for N64. Now that was an awesome game. Playing PD N64 with my siblings was the best. The bots, the weapons, the levels, it was great. The controls were so much better on N64 too.Its too late to appreciate this game, too many other excellent jaw-dropping games are out... buy something like Halo or GoW."
3,Just another half baked title,there is nothing special here I really don't know why this game go high reviews mainly a lot of creeping around and it has kind of a poor aiming system for the weapons.
5,Pefect Dark for XBox 360..amazing!,"Perfect Dark was one of the first 360 games i played and i was absolutely hooked from the beginning. the graphics are great, gameplay is awesome, and the co-op option is great. not having to follow eachother and you can do your own thing. great game and anyone who likes a good, challeging shooter game..PERFECT DARK is for you."
3,Does not live up to N64 perfect dark,"This is fun, but not nearly as sophisticated as the n64 game.The graphics are high def, but the n64 version had more style and intrigue. The story line is not as good as the n64 version either."
1,This game.......................,This game is how do i say this................... Terrible. I loved the Perfect Dark 64 but this one is just horrible not even worth the 4 bucks i payed for it honestly....
2,Complete Disappointment,"Great graphics, but that's just about it. I was very disappointed with this game. It had so much potential. I read one reviewer claim that Perfect Dark Zero was as good as Halo...completely untrue. I'm trading it in for Ghost Recon."
2,Bad game,"I know, this game is old, I picked it up at launch. But after seeing it under the ""recommended for you"" category on Amazon, I felt compelled to warn others to NOT buy this game.As a person who LOVED Perfect Dark 64, I was thoroughly underwhelmed by this game. I cannot describe what a totally different game it is. I'm not sure if Rare lost their talent, but man- it is different, and NOT in a good way. This game has frustratingly poor level design- it's laughable. It's so bad that if you don't move for five seconds, arrows light up on the ground to send you in the right direction. That should NOT be necessary. The plot is pretty cliched- it's not helped that it's a prequel, but it IS thoroughly predictable, particularly towards the end. Of course, Carringtonn makes an appearance- with a thick Scottish accent not present in Perfect Dark 64 in any form whatsover.Online play is extremely mediocre too.Avoid this game. It's not worth $20."
5,WOWOWOWOWOW,"Wow. What a great game. If you are wanting to show off and showcase your new system. This is the game to do it. Kameo is good. THis is the best. Does it compare with Halo? Absolutely. The graphics are incredible. You will not have this kind of graphical experience on any current generation hardware. Only Xbox 360 can provide it. This game has a great co-op mode to play the whole game in either by split screen or by Xbox Live. This is no ordinary co-op either. Sometimes you don't even start in the same place on the level. the story is meh. But the action and the graphics and the gameplay more than make up for the story.Bottom Line: Buy this game with your new XBOX 360. If you need two games, get this one and Kameo."
4,Great older game for the 360,"As times goes on, game companies are using more and more of the potential for the XBox 360. As one of the first FPS games for the 360 the graphics are hard to compare to some of the new games but overall this is a solid title that offers are good bit of fun. I would probably have given the game 3 stars a year ago but since it's an older games with a correspondingly reduced price, it is definately worth a buy."
4,Great Game,This is a great game. The online play is virtually flawless. And I has a good one player story-line. I highly recommend this game if you like first person shooters.
4,Not Perfect,"Perfect Dark Zero is one of the launch games for the X-box 360. First of all, launch games rarely take advantage of the full power of new consoles. Perfect Dark Zero is no exception. The biggest complaint is that the story mode is really cheesy and almost no fun to play. You get treated to a lot of pointless story plots and poor dialog which is so bad you might want to turn the sound off while you play. The character design is also really spotty, and I feel that they could have done a better job on a next generation console.On the plus side, the deathmatch option is a lot of fun. The scale and design of the maps is wonderful and they look beautiful. You can also mix up the multiplay by adding bots. Since most people use FPS for deathmatch rather than the story mode, I can recommend picking this up until something better comes along."
1,Original Perfect Dark was WAY better than this.,"I got this trying to spend $25 on an order so it would qualify for Free Super Saver Shipping. I had to spend just a few more bucks and that's how much this thing cost.Looks like I'm a very spoiled FPS gamer. Had been playing Reach for a while. It made this game feel extremely horrible in every way: slow controls, dumb AI, long loading times, very poor graphics, lame sounds, ...the list can go on for ever. I didn't get past the 2nd mission before I felt the need to put it down and never put myself through that again. The original N64 Perfect Dark was way better than this.I recently traded it back to Amazon for a credit of just a few cents. I feel like I got a great deal for such a worthless game."
3,"Great for co-op, boring in single player","I got this game to split screen with a friend. If that is your goal, you will have fun. In single player, it is a whole lot more boring and the AI players are useless. Still, it is cheap and fun in co-op. Not sorry I bought it."
3,Worth 5 bucks...thats all,I think this game is dated but worth a try because it has bots & offline modes to go along with a full single player.Heres why I rated it rather low. The single player is pretty frustrating because its hard to find the right direction you must go. The AI is kinda stupid. You cant skip cutscenes everytime. The walking speed is slowThe offline bots are either stupid on a difficulty or too damn headshot effiecient on the next level. So that makes offline multiplayer kinda suck
5,Well written book that is a great read!,"Do you enjoy people watching, trying to figure out what is going on within a person? Then this is a book that you will love. The 14 seperate short stories in it are excellently written about individual lives. The humor in each story has often made me laugh out loud. The laughter often turns to amazment as the addictions and personal nurosis of a character becomes apparent in the stories.Though each story is seperate the author did a great job in connecting each story so that it reads very smoothly.If you enjoy psychology, sociology, and human behavior this is the book for you."
5,A Must-Have for Ford Tractor Enthusiasts!,"As an owner of a 1952 Ford 8N tractor who is seriously considering a major restoration, this book has been a major source of inspiration. Fully packed with high-quality color photos, this book provides a comprehensive guide to the important details one should consider when buying or restoring a Ford N-Series tractor. Especially revealing are the charts outlining correct paint and trim details, including correct decal placement. A basic guide is provided for differentiating between the various N-Series tractors. Full-color photos of basic tractors, optional accessories and and rare models and aftermarket conversions make for an interesting read. A brief history of the Ford tractor and a vendor list and bibliography make this a valuable resource for those of us bitten by the Ford N-bug."
4,A must-have book for the Ford tractor collector/restorer,"Although there may be a few minor details subject to scrutiny, this work meets an important need. Replete with color and B/W photos, the authors point out the differences between the various Ford N-models, and attempt to illustrate the important details to be considered when restoring these tractors. Paint details, variations in models and years, options, and anomalies are described in detail. As with many Motorbooks International publications, there is a tendancy to use oft-published photos, but this is not a major concern. A section on the popular Sherman auxiliary transmissions includes a table of various gear ratios and speed ranges. Original and aftermarket reproduction aprts are compared and the appendix includes a pretty thorough list of suppliers. While this book is not the final authority on the subject, it is by far the best thing yet to come out on this topic. Highly recommended."
4,Awesome gift!,"I wish they made these in more player's jerseys! Not a cheap ball, and the seams are done well."
5,Dead Set Reckoning !,"Dead Reckonong is an ideal introduction to the talents of Kieran Kane. Recorded in 1994 with Dead Reckoning label partners including Mike Henderson (guitars), Tammy Rogers (fiddle) and Harry Stinson (drums) providing support, the tracks on ""ead Reckoning are well structured, sung, arranged and played and effortlessly cross the alternative country, roots, folk and rock boundraries with precision and ease. Overall, Dead Reckoning is extremely user friendly and will satisfy fans of contemporary singer song writers and those (like myself) who need to add some more twang and rockin' pedal steel to their CD collection."
1,Not good.,"I have purchased this and to my grave dissapointemnt this product does not work. The customer service is rude, sarcastic and not helpful. The most awful experience I have had while buying from these people.Beware and do not give them your money! Products doesnt work and returns are a hassle!!! The shaver works so slowly and badly that I wouldnt even try to return it anymore, it belongs in the trash, not here for sale"
1,Junk - Waste of Money & Time!,"The charge on this unit didn't last long enough to shave one 3/4 length sweater coat - and that's with the unit plugged in the whole time. Razortek and Smartek (I think they are the same company - I bought one from each company) sell junk. The first one from Smartek arrived used and broken. Now I'm returning the second one from Razortek. The costs alone have added up to more than I paid for the unit. JUNK, JUNK JUNK & LOUSY SERVICE!"
3,"Simple, but true.","The board covers only a part of the screen. There are only a handful of opponents. The pieces are 2D. But if you are the type that used to reach for an instamatic camera vs a 35mm, this game may be for you. Here's the ""compensation"" as the chess term goes: 1) The board colors are clear and easy to see. 2) The menu is very easy and you should be playing it in a minute or so. 3) The computer does not give decimal mind-spining calculations of advantage or disadvantage, but puts it in ""plain English""; ""White is a little better"", ""Black has large advantage"" and so on. 4)Clear chess notation. 5) You can actual beat it at the lower levels and be challenged at the higher levels. The AI is practical and pleasant to play against. 6) It should be quite inexpensive used. And it could be so simple that you could be enjoying the game before you know it. And since this is a game that people have been enjoying for 1400 years, that's not bad at all."
5,Boro lad,"Im a boro lad, went to Stainsby school, worked at Davy Ashmores, Went to Rheas ice cream shops. Love Chris Rhea brings back memories of life in the Boro"
4,EXCELLENT REA CD,"I have most of REA's CD's and bought this in germany, because it was on special. I had lost sight of him after the ""GREATEST HITS""collection and I don't think his newer output was released in AUSTRALIA. ( SHAME ) This is a great CD from a true master. Great songs, great guitar playing and not a bad track amongst them. From rock to blues to ballads, this has it all and they are all excellent. I liked it the first time I heard it, now I love it. And it is still getting better. If you like REA or his style of music, you must buy this."
4,Misternick,"I can't understand the lack of recognition for Chris Rea here in the US. I have all his albums and am rarely disappointed by him. His writing, melodies, guitar work and gravelly voice combine for some truly great tracks. Every album has a stand out track and on this one I would say that ""I'm Sill Holding On"" is it on Blue Cafe. Once you listen to him on any album you will be captivated by his presence and will enjoy that rare opportunity to explore more music from a new (to you) artist. You won't regret it!"
4,"""Mass Appeal"" available from Amazon","I looked for this in stores without success and was surprised to find it available at Amazon. I enjoyed this movie when I first went to see it in theaters in the early 80's. Thanks to Amazon's arrangement with the movie studio's, I was able to enjoy it again. Jack Lemmon was at his best in this movie. The format cannot be played on computer drives or recordable VCR's."
5,Tremendous message - hearing only what we want to hear!!,"Since I had to return the DVD, I thought about not submitting a review. I had seen this movie previously and rate it five stars. There was a flaw in the DVD (no fault of Amazon), necessitating its return. I applaud the way Amazon handled this and based on my previous experiences with them, and especially THIS ONE, I will continue to be a customer and advocate of this very fine organization. Thank you!!!! Tom"
2,Waste of Time. Even for Stoners,"Like Zombie movies, there are too many bad stoner films. This is one of them. If you can get through the first 20 minutes without turning it off, you are really generous, or very, very high."
4,Not too shabby,"I paid a grand total of $7 for this CD at an indepenant record store, and that's about how good it is. The Grabbers - ""Santa's on the Nod"" is extremly funny, and in my opinion, the best song."
5,Fresh and captivating....,"Bought this cd on the recommendation of a friend, but was a little dubious as he and I have very different collections...that is until I was captivated by the first track, then equally hooked by those that follow. I listen to this all the time."
5,Well written easily understood Bridge Conventions,Enjoy reviewing bridge conventions that you probably know.Then move on to learning new conventions that may help your game.
4,Better than Mary's D.,I was a huge fan of Mary's D. and this is what their sound would have been if they took a few layers off. Straight chunky rock with thought and feelings in the lyrics. Gretchen's unmistakable voice was perfect for this short lived outfit. It goes without saying they were great live.
5,Magnifico,"This is my favorite perfume, and I was told that it was not being manufactured anymore. So I decided to go online and try to find it. Not only is it available, but it is at a very reasonable price. I am thrilled to have found it, and hope to order more very soon. Just in case it really is not being manufactured any longe."
4,Quite Nice for an EdT. Body Butter pretty good too.,"Manifesto is a fresh green floral, neither too sharp nor too biting imo. The top (basil, bergamot & pepper) is very subtle & not to be feared. The floral-fruity heart is quite lovely, and I can clearly detect rose 2-3 hours out. The base settles into a skin scent on me. It's is neither sharp nor peppery as some others have reported in reviews available online.Manifesto is a good match for my chemistry & taste. Someone once described Manifesto as morning dew in a forest after night rain - spot-on! It's well-rounded & unique. Very wearable in warm weather too.I resisted blind buying Manifesto because of mixed reviews, but I should have never doubted my fave nose, Alberto Morillas. However, the EDT is not as strong or as long-lasting as I would like. However, it layers nicely with the body butter (body balm) which can be found here and elsewhere at a good price."
3,Not to impressive,"The perfume is not to my liking. It is more musty than want I expected. If you are looking for a fresh, or sweet scent, this perfume is not for you."
4,My ferrets like it,"I have four ferrets and three of them have showed interest in this toy. I received the strawberry version and its very cute. It has a rattle inside which is why I think my ferrets like it so much. They like to bat it around and shake it. I bought it over a year ago and it still looks great. My youngest ferret, who is a year and half old usually chews up any toy I leave in their cage but this toy hes never tried to chew it up. I think that's because he can't carry it off into one of his nap sacks. I also like that they can't carry it off to their litter boxes like they do to the rest of their toys. The only bad thing about this toy is that the clasp broke the first time I washed it so now I have it just tied to the cage."
5,Great toy if your ferret likes it,"I have 2 male ferrets; one of them ignores this completely, and the other goes crazy trying to pull it away to one of his secret stashes. There is one corner of the cage they sometimes use as a bathroom when they should not.. this has stopped completely since I hung this toy in that corner. I had been putting a plush ferret sleeping bag there for the same effect, but the ferret with the stealing tendencies would always drag it away. Although it's nothing more than a plush toy on an elastic band with a rattle in it, it is just what I needed."
4,An instant favorite,"I barely got this toy into the cage before it became the new favorite toy for one of my ferrets. It's the perfect small size and material for pouncing. The elastic strap is adjustable, so it will fit pretty much any two level or taller cage. I found the best entertainment value by setting the elastic so that the toy rests just out of reach when my ferret lays on her back. This makes the perfect pouncing height and causes it too bounce out of reach when she loses her grip, which just begs for another round. The chuckling is practically endless.I would have given this toy five stars, but it comes with a fairly large label that strikes me as a choking hazard. Still, the tag is easily removed, so it wasn't a big issue."
4,Good Book!,"I love history and science and I thought this book was a good mix of the two. The first couple chapters are a little technical but informative and understandable. I loved reading how diseases altered the histories of empires, info that you might not necessarily read in just a straight up history book.I also really enjoyed the look at work that is presently underway to prevent future pandemics such as the avian flu and the work being put in to curb the continued spread of HIV and find an eventual cure. The stories contained in these pages makes you appreciate the period we live in and all the contributions and sacrifices made by the researchers that came before us."
2,Not great,"I was not impressed by this book. I admit I have, so far, only glanced at it. What I found was:- one factual error: Sherlock Holemns was based on Prof Joeseph Bell not Dr Charles Bell- a very cursory description of the history and recent outbreak of the Ebola virus. I would expect Time magazine to have a better article;- an exetremely cursory description of Hantaviruses. The Field Guide to Germs by Wayne Biddle does it better;- avarege descriptions of the histories of ""classic"" infectious diseases such as yellow fever. I recommend Plague, Pox & Pestilence by Kenneth F. Kipple (Ed.) for an excellent lay introduction to the topic."
4,"At lasr in dvd, when talespin too?","At last... in dvd, the disney's classics in our hands, but when will appear the four pilots, and talespin (excellent serie too) in dvd, disney will hurry please..."
2,"Good, but not ""Complete""","This is a fine set for any kid. But not for fans. No, this set is lacking the first four episodes that establish the characters. For baffling reasons, the folks at Disney decided not to include these episodes. This makes the set less thatnm staisfactory, and wholly dissapointing.The episodes weren't restored, and the sound is plain mono, but the fans will be dissapointed."
5,A nice piece of nostalgia and a reminder of when cartoons were great,"As I purchase various items which I only remember from my days as a kid 10 or 13 years ago I am consistently impressed by how some of them stand the test of time so well. Well, CDRR Vol. 1 does not fail in this regard, now if only they would release Vol. 3 already."
5,Fantastic DVD-box,"I'm very pleased with this buy! unfortunately Disney's not going to bring out this complete serie in Europe. We onely have 5 episodes on a disc because of the different languages that have to be on the disc. The onely thing is that I can't watch it in Dutch like when I was young, but that's no problem at all... Happely I could buy the dvd-box at Amazon. Even with shipping it's cheaper than in Europe, even through I had to pay another 10 euro's import-taxes to get it into the Netherlands. This box makes me think about my youth, when I watched it when it was on television:d Great memories!"
4,Buyer Beware!,"Not a bad box set, but VOLUME ONE DOES NOT CONTAIN THE PILOT!!! I wish I'd known that before I bought it, because the pilot was my favorite part. Vol.2 contains the five-part pilot episodes. Overall, not a bad purchase though. You'll like it for different reasons than you did when you were a kid (if you're a twentysomething buying it for nostalgia), but you will like it."
1,Such a disappointment!,"I bought this for my children who loved the DVD of ""classic"" Chip N Dale cartoons. This was a big disappointment. The quality of everything from the stories to the animation is subpar. I was also quite disappointed to find that Dale's voice is redone to sound more ""goofy"". Several of the cartoons where also a bit more in the modern/adult style (aka cartoon network/ren and stimpy/etc.) - fine for myself but not what I want my kids to watch."
4,awesome,I love this cartoon when I was a kid. I would much rather have my kids watch this than sponge bob or Icarly any day.
5,Hours of entertainment,"My 3 and 4 year olds will sit and watch one entire DVD if I let them. They love the show, which is about crazy bad guys (like mad scientists and fat cats) trying to get away with evil plans. Thankfully the Rescue Rangers always foil their evil plots. My only grievance is that Chip and Dale call each other 'stupid' etc. which I have been trying to stop in my house. Oh well."
5,Father and Son time,Great cartoons that I grew up on are now something my 4 year old and I can watch together. This brings back great memories and allows me to create memories with my son.
5,"Great Cartoon, will buy all sets when 3rd comes out",I checked this out from my local library and it brought back memories. I thought all the episodes were on the two sets but it looks like Disney still needs to release the third set and the longer first episode. I fear it is never going to happen though but I don't want to buy these two and then have the box set come out like what happened with Fraggle Rock. I wish Disney would release things as complete collections to make sure they get every episode out.
4,home boi flows r good,"the homey saigon is nice mane....the flow r real tight and how u kno that he been though some real things in his life time.....the beat r ok nothing to get all hype about but it goes good wit his voice and lyrics. go get this cd fo real and listern to ny streets,shock tv,l.o.v.e, and let a nigga kno"
2,BULLSHIT. CAVED IN TO INDUSTRY DEMANDS.,"I heard of Saigon a few years ago on mixtapes and thought he was hot. As a matter of fact, most of his mixtape joints are blazin. HOWEVER...I'm extremely disappointed with this release. It sounds like he changed his whole style to fit the ""industry"" criteria. The rhymes are corny. The beats are repetetive. Even the album cover is corny. There's one or two tracks worth listening to, nothing blazing. Saigon doesnt sound like he cares. There's no feeling in this album. Dont recommend you buy it. Download it."
4,The Best Underground MC,I've been listening to Sai-giddy since he pressed the contraband record on RAWKUS. He has been in this rap game for a while now but as you know he's been servin time and droppin the illest mixtapes in the meantime. This mixtape is a good mix of what you can expect from him. I do have to agree with an earlier reviewer in sayin that his BEST MIXTAPES are the first 2 or 3 he made in-between gettin locked up. He made those with Kayslay and trust me there is no filler what so-ever on those. All in all this should leave you wantin some more so go do some homework!!! PEACE
5,re: Mexican Beans,Mexican beans are the greatest for making extract . Service was quick and on time. I would advise anyone to choose this company.
2,"""Arazona Vanilla"" is ""Halaleveryday""",The Mexican beans that I ordered from Arizona Vanilla Co. came from a company called Halal Everyday. Halal means lawful or clean according to Islamic law. I am not Muslim and feel that failing to disclose the fact that food/food products are prepared according to religious laws that I do not accept is a fraud. Arizona should state that their products are Halal for the benefit of all their customers Muslim and non-Muslim.
3,Good choice for beginners,"I buy this book when I began to shoot weddings, I didn't know not a lot on not a lot and it really helps me, If you're a beginner in this business it's definitely a good choice !"
2,Just like Rick's old wedding photography books...,"I found this book to be super disapointing. This is the third edition, and NO new photos (very few to be fair). If this is for anyone, it would be the super-traditional wedding photographer. The section on marketing was a joke, and all of the ad's shown in the book look like ad's from 1994. Do not buy this book if you are a creative photojournalist. You will be very disapointed. Buy Bambi Cantrel's books instead!"
2,"Outdated, but only printed last year!","I am new to Wedding photography and picked up this book at my local library. First off if you are a ""photojournalist"" do not bother investing your money in this book. This book focuses more on chessy formal shots, that look like they are from the 1980's. What is more suprising was when I found out this book was made only last year. It's severely outdated style wise and not for the modern photographer.The only thing I took from this book was the contract and business information. At least that was something that can not go out of date."
2,Good start for a beginner,"I do not recommend this book. It is definitely a good start for a beginner writer, but it is also annoying at times. I have never read the word ""blond"" so many times in my life. The writer has potential, though."
3,fun read,"Actually I thought it deserved 3 1/2 stars. Interesting book. Part drama, part comedy. Part murder mystery, part love story. Fun read."
3,Good brief intro to Japan but annoyingly poor English,"I found this book helpful in offering brief chapters on many aspects of Japanese culture, though it offers very little help with the Japanese language - you need a book devoted to Japanese for that. However, the book is written in surprisingly poor English, with awkward syntax and some outright grammatical errors that should have been eliminated in the editing process. If you're not sensitive to such problems this might be a helpful book for someone planning a trip to Japan and seeking a brief introduction to the land and culture."
3,Nice Guitar music but hardly to be called 'flamenco'.,"I bought this record because of cuts 1 thru 4, 6, and 8 thru 10. Eight out of twelve, not bad! This CD invites to search more for the styles of Oscar Lopez, what a sample! Jesse Cook and Armik. I already own albums by C.Spheeris and Govi. Spheeris sample is not flamenco at all but pure mediterranean sentiment and feeling. Govi's sample is close to a jazzy caribean merengue, light an happy. Flamenco, hardly. Armik's cut reminds us of the Latin American trios epoch in the 40's and 50's. Nice finger play. The ones with 'flamenco' names come as weak imitations of the Gypsy Kings style. What, no Strunz and Farrah sample?!! Oh, well. The variety of samples is what makes this record stand out, but it hardly qualifies as flamenco playing. Perhaps the sub-title should have been ""New Guitar Romance"". Try the CD for a soft candlelight dinner or a pleasant conversation over wine and cheese. 3 and half stars."
4,"Pleasant, relaxing, mood elevating",I often buy music that I know nothing about. I enjoyed the soft sensous sound of the guitars. I was suprised at what peaceful music this was since I always thought of flamengo as loud and brash. I am going to purchase more music like this. It makes a good background while working or I like to just lay and listen to the fine guitar work.
2,A letdown,"This collection features some well known names but the music is not up to par.The Cook,Armik,Govi and Lopez contributions are all mediocre at best, and Energipsy is just plain awful.There are two songs that redeem the album somewhat.""Night in the south"" by Jose Luis Encinas is very melancholy and brooding,and ""Pozo Del Deseo"" from Songhai 2 is a wonderful piece, so gorgeous and somber with the help of the angelic children's chorus and violin.Again Narada has put out another subpar collection.The label desperately needs some new people to come in and make better decisions in regards to compiling collections such as these."
3,energipsy cut has passion,"I don't listen to flamenco nuveau too much and most of the songs are for relaxing, but the song from energipsy swings right between jazz and more traditional flamenco palo.The rest is ok."
4,Romantic music,"It's romantic music, a little more fiery would have been great, but it's soothing for the soul. The artists are top notch."
4,good product,"bought to give gift to relative, she liked it good products. rest of the words for amazon 20 counts one two three"
4,Good,"Excelente producto, me gusta mucho la fragancia y entregado a tiempo y en optimas condiciones, recomiendo al vendedor y el producto"
5,"Great product, great service!","My mother bought the smaller bottle of this perfume for my then thirteen year old sister a year and a half ago. She was in love with it, as was anyone who smelled her. She ran out around christmas time and has been begging for a new bottle since, so I decided to buy her this larger 3 ounce bottle for her 15th birthday.I placed the order on Monday 3/17, and it arrived on my doorstep noon today! (Tuesday 3/18) I was very satisfied because I had decided to use the free super saving shipping option which told me that I wouldn't recieve it until April 3rd! I regret not ordering one for myself, and I would definetly recommend this scent to any young woman!By the way, this is the first time I've ever ordered anything online!"
5,Perfume smells excellent!!!,"Whatever your preference is for Paris Hilton, it shouldn't stop you from buying this perfume. I love, love how it smells. It's fun and sassy.I would say if you like the smell of Victoria's Secret Pink you will enjoy this as well. That's the closest comparison I can think of. They have similar qualities."
5,great smell! men always comment me on,Men always comment when I wear this! It's cheap so beware if you don't like smelling like other women you are around.
3,Smells Beautiful!,"Love this perfume! A very floral and powdery girly smell!Only gripe is that it doesn't last long (like I cannot smell it throughout the day, or when I sweat at the gym like I can smell some of my other perfumes). You do get a lot for the price though."
1,Strong Scented Perfume,This perfume is very strong at first. But mellows after a few hours it gave me a headache and made me feel sick. If you like light scented perfumes stay away from this one! It smells okay but its too strong!!!
4,Paris Hilton Perfume,"The first time I ordered, the product never came. But I e-mailed Amazon.com about the problem and they responded within a few hours and mailed me a brand-new one with one-day shipping! I love the perfume, it is fruity and subtle. It is not one of those over-powering perfumes that some people like."
2,smells good but the scent dont stay long,I LOVE THE SMELL BUT AFTER A HALF HOUR I DONT SMELL IT ON ME ANYMORE. I HAVE TO KP SPRAYING EVRY HOUR. SO DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I KNOW I WONT WASTE MY CASH BY BUYIN HER PERFUME . ILL STICK TO THE OLD SCHOOL PERFUMES THAT STAYS ON ALLDAY SUCH AS LIZ TAYLOR GIVENCY 273 AND JADORE. THESE 2K PERFUMES ARE GARBAGE.
4,good service,"very good service, delivery was on time as promised, excellentI found very fulfilled. For me the most important is that if you give me a date, the same is met."
3,not bad,"It's good, the smell lasts me all the time even after bath, I like it as floral. For all occasions"
4,Best perfum,"Lovely scent and always gets compliments.It lasts forever and seems more concentrated than others so a little goes a long way, it's a bit too easy to overdo this one. the body lotion is particularly nice."
4,Nice procuct,I am not crazy about Paris or her promescuity but I have to confess that I like the scent of this perfume. I received it as a gift and I am considering buying some when I run out.
1,Plastic Smelling Doesn't last,"Got this as a gift and very disappointed. It's ok if you're under 10, but for teens or young women it's not a good scent. It doesn't last and after a few minutes it turns into plastic smelling. Should be about $2.99 for sale at KMart not Macys. You're buying the name not a quality product. I also received a Hilton necklace and some stones were missing. I was too embarassed to ask for the gift receipt so I threw it in the garbage. Stick to the big brands like DK, Dolce, Angel, Burberry etc. They don't smell cheap and they have lasting power."

5,a teen whos got something to say,"iloved the smell of paris hilton eau de toilette spray i would suggest to anyone to buy this perfume. Since i am a big Paris Hilton fan i had to get this perfume as soon as it came out i was amazed by the beautiful smell, the smell is fruity and delisious. so if you dont have this, i highly suggest that you run to the mall stop at bebe's buy a cute outfit, get a pedecure,buy the book confessions of an heiress written by paris hilton , then buy this Paris hilton perfume."
2,Kind of dissapointed...,"...although I don't know why i'm dissapointed. I mean, I never thought of anything with this perfume. I tried it, but have got to say am dissatisfied. To me, after spraying the perfume, it smelt rather 'cheap'? I don't know how else to put it. But after awhile it settles, it's okay. Like it's not as bad as the initial spray; but I wouldn't buy it."
4,nice scent,I'm only 11 and I like this perfume. It has a nice scent to it. It's $40.00 but well worth it . When you first wear it will have a strong scent but after you wear it a while it will smell more natural.
2,"Smell fantastic, but does not last long",I loved the smell of this perfume -- but it does not last very long.
5,Paris Hilton perfume,Love this perfume. I would recommend this to my friends and family. All of her perfumes are great. Try it and you will like it.
4,cheaper on here then department stores,"smells wonderful,definately would recommend it to someone looking for a sweet scent,not a fan of paris hilton but i certainly am a fan of this perfume"
3,"OK, without fanfare.","It is a perfume normal, typical for a modest gift without much fanfare. Any woman would like, but not the favorite ever."
4,On the second bottle,"I don't know how to describe this smell except it smells really good and leaves an impression on peoples memory. When I wear this perfume, I always receive alot of compliments! Highly recommend this perfume."
1,Scent doesn't last,This is my favorite perfume and I was so excited to find it for much less on Amazon. I purchased the perfume one and I was very disappointed once I put it on. I put it on before leaving with my mom and sister. An hour later when we were in the car the scent was gone. I think it's better to spend a bit more and purchase it at the store where you can actually return a faulty product.
2,Smells different than other bottles I have owned,I don't know if I bought from a bad batch but it does smell like it went bad. I ended up buying another bottle from Kohl's and it is the BEAUTIFUL fragrance that I love.
5,Great fragrance,My daughter received this fragrance as a birthday present last year and we all fell in love with it. She ran out of it not long ago so I purchased this bottle for her for Christmas! We all love the fragrance!
1,Hello Acetone!,"I wanted to like this as much as many of you. Yes, I do smell the fruity melon- kind of a sweet honeydew melon? Every single time I have worn this, it smells like melon mixed with ACETONE! Like nail polish remover! STRONGLY! I have seen other reviewers mention the chemical-ish smell.. spot on. I just hate it. And I must be one lucky girl cause perfume lasts on me ALL DAY- any kind- without re-applying; I saw many complaints about this not having staying power. Well i wish it wore off me sooner, ugh. It came in one of her gift sets of 4 small mini's. i LOVE heiress, can can, and siren. Actually bought all of those in larger bottles. Self titled can... rot. Gross."
2,Yech. No thanks.,"I don't know what I was thinking when I purchased this. I thought it smelled good in the store, but when I got it home and started wearing it, it kept making me feel queasy. I would catch whiffs of myself throughout the day and think, ""ew, who smells like whore - oh crap! It's me!""Pass. Maybe it just didn't jive with my body chemistry."
2,Smells as tacky as Paris herself,My husband bought this for me and I hope he doesnt see this review but I have to say that it really smells like cheap perfume; just like I would expect Paris to. I guess that means its authentic. I tried it on two different occasions and I just couldnt take it anymore. Maybe a lot of people like it but I dont see how.
3,"awesome smell,don't last long",this perfume has an awesome smell but it doesn't last long enough I wish it did! aroma 5 stars lasting effect 2
1,What exactly is the point of this skin?,"This product does not come with a screen cover. Sure, it doesn't say it has one in the description, but what's the point of having an iPod case if it doesn't protect the screen?"
4,It's not for play!!,"This toy is not for play. I collect the predators and aliens from all the movies. I'm just a kid and my collection is pretty big. Every now and then, I play with them. But not this one. IT has almost no poseability. The guys aren't removable and are small. But, it does make a good collector's item."
3,Predator throws Alien,Good sculpt but the few points of articulation that this figure has were very loose on the one that I rcv'd. Causing it to not look to good when posed and displayed.
4,Quite Good,"This book is not a bad attempt at a giving a serious, critical interpretation to just about all of Gogol's oeuvre. The author says that he tries to eschew 'critical monotheism' and at this he seems successful. He gives each of Gogol's works an individual treatment, while still weaving them into the larger narratives of Gogol's 'creative path' (tvorcheskij pyt') and of Russian literature as a whole. Particular attention is devoted (understandably) to ""Dead Souls."" I am a little perplexed by Peace's reading of ""The Overcoat,"" which, while certainly original, strikes me as misguided. Though I admit that I'm no Gogol adept (and therefore really don't know), I suspect this is one of the best books in English on Gogol."
3,OK...but not for the price!,"The item itself is OK, but way too expensive. My 4 yr old wanted a superman cape, and this was the only one we could find by iteself. The sounds are very quiet, so might as well not be there. The collar part is too heavy and it slides back so it is uncomfortable for him. The cape itself is plastic, not material. It is a decent thickness, but Im sure in no time will be ripped. If you can find it on sale, go ahead...but dont pay full price."
1,great if you like choking your child,"the molded plastic does not stay on the kid's shoulders and as soon as my grandson raises his arms as if to fly, the cape drops down his back & the S shield pulls against his neck and chokes him. I am so disappointed. He would love it otherwise but will not wear it because it is painful. Do not waste your money."
4,Simple small serene,"This interactive game has 3 sections. One part reads the Poky Little Puppy story with highlights. The second part has activities -- coloring, memory cards with 5 levels, puzzles, and counting. The third part is an explore section where if you click on the pictures on the book, they animate and talk. The narrator's voice is very pleasant. The music soundtrack is repetitive but pleasant. This is a pleasant, soothing game that is a little challenging, mostly fun to play at the same excitement level as reading a book to a child or coloring a picture. Not as frenetic as Freddi Fish. Similar to I Spy. Appears to be rendered in Macromedia Flash and may run slow for the puzzles activity on Pentium 133s; everything else ran smoothly. Recommended for 6 and under that can handle mouse dragging."
5,This is the Fattest Remix Puff Daddy has put out,Not only is Puffy the King of Hip Hop... He has his family to back him up... and what a family to have your back like they do... They're all so talented and this not only is the Best remix by Puffy and the family but it's also the best video... I suggest you buy this if you're a fan of Puff Daddy and the fam... YOU WONT BE DISSAPPOINTED!
1,puff daddy is poor,"This is not real rap it's teeny pop music, the lyrics are appalling rapped in a terribly monotonous way, with corny backing music. Puff daddy is a rubbish rapper anyone who buys his music should be ashamed of themselves and obviously doesn't know what real rap is. This is poor."
4,Tremendous Resource for Vacation Owners!,"As an owner and manager of several vacation properties, I was quite impressed with Kristine's thoroughness and attention to detail. This is a very read-able book, flows easily from topic to topic, and covers all the basics.Of particular importance is her break-even analysis for figuring out the profitability of a rental before buying. Also, while I'm a do-it-yourself-vacation rental type owner, I realize most people prefer the ready-to-rent approach Ms. Karpinski advocates.The Resources found in the Appendix sections at the end make this book a definite buy for any current or future vacation property owner. Kristine is a good teacher and presents well in both her books and blog."
1,A lot of 'TOSH',"She makes it sound like renting is a sure-thing with example upon example about how properties sold out. I followed her recommendations and ended up spending a lot of money on advertising sites that yielded nothing but solicitations from other advertising sites, only to get one or two rentals a year from one particular site which was specific to the area.She also fails to mention what a huge pain in the a** renters can be, how they relentlessly complain and how some will do anything to cut an additional amount off the rental price.The book is a good start (since there are none other out there), but there's no replacement for experience."
4,Help: Sabotabing neighbors,Fabulous book. right to the point with all of the basis to cover except dealing with obstinant neighbors that don't want you to rent. YOu covered it all except for how to deal with them and the sherrif they call to strategically make it difficult for you.
2,"Useful, but disappointing.","The basic premise of this book is great...simple ideas for preparing and marketing your vacation rental property. However, the author acts as an authority, yet trips on her own mistakes. For instance, her heavy suggestion that a VR owner hire a professional writer or editor is overshadowed by the fact that shehas numerour grammatical and punctual errors in that very section of the book! Overall, the meat of the book is a bit lean. She touches on many good points lightly. The author is now employed by a VRBO website: i.e., she's making her living not just as a vacation rental owner, but now working for a website which advertises the VRBOs. That to me underscores that she is willign to go where the money is, and may not necessarily be the expert she portrays herself to be. Some great ideas here, but not to be taken as the ""bible"" of the VRBO world by any means."
5,Extremely helpful book,We have just started to rent our vacation property by owner after having it done by a management company. This book has been extremely helpful in making the transition.
4,"Informative - Slightly Biased, Good if Homeowner","This book we've relied on for many tips on how to improve our vacation home product that we offer year round. We own a company, Utah's Best Vacation Rentals, [...] that offers year round vacation home rentals in Salt Lake City and Park City.We purchased this book to learn more about VRBO and how best to setup our homes with the guest in mind. There are many complexities we had questions about that in some small way the author of this book touched on and was useful for the $15 we spent, but nowhere near comprehensive.For homeowners this probably would be a valuable tool, especially if you have never equipped or setup a private residence for a vacation home.If you have to pay over $25 it's probably not the best value. If you are ever in Utah, consider looking us up if you want to experience many of the tips in this book in a real life vacation rental home."
4,Not bad...,"this is the first book I have read on this topic and I felt that it was fairly informative. I read all of the reviews on it before I purchased it and some of the negative ones were a little off base. The only problem I had with the book was the constant reference to different websites, most of which are affiliated with the company she works for. Other than that, I thought it was a good book with lots of information."
5,Finally Someone Talks About Insurance,"I was impressed with this book because most rental managers don't even discuss insurance or know anything about it. Yet, this book devotes several pages on this topic. So, If you got a vacation rental, or thinking about it like me, your common garden variety homeowners policy won't do. You got to pay twice or more on the premium for a vacation home."
5,I wish I'd read this before,I wish I'd read this book before we bought a vacation rental. Lots of good information. And one piece of the information could save you thousands of $ and loads of grief.
2,Execution is the key,"The idea that Gostick and Elton proposed is not new. In fact, it has been proposed in 1940s by Abraham Maslow in his hierarchy of needs. Maslow's argued that human behaviors are motivated by a series of needs, and are hierarchical in nature. If I understand correctly what Maslow had proposed and applied the same theory to this book, in fact what we are seeing is the execution of satisfying the needs on love/belonging and esteem. This is why an employee will prefer public recognition anytime compare to bonuses, since money, to a large degree, is use to satify the human needs for food and shelter only, which is at the lowest hierarchy of all human needs. The book carries no new theory of human behavior, but a new way in reminding managers that employees are human, and do satisfy human needs in the hierarchical form."
5,A golden tool for managers!,"Gostick and Elton have woven a clever story together with thoughtful insight and straight-forward HR advice to create a book that should circulate through the management ranks of every organization bent on success. It will soon circulate through ours!""The 24-Carrot Manager"" is a quick-paced, entertaining read with a bushel-basket full of ideas on how to motivate and retain the best employees in any organization. More importantly, ""The 24-Carrot Manager"" underscores why employee motivation is central to YOUR success as a manager. It's a 24-karat winner!"
2,not what i expected,didnot like this one as much as emotions.... Maybe my expectations were too high after listening to Maria Valencia in besieged
5,Early Bowie Book,"Good pictures, not to many though. This book from 1977 has a lot of excellent pictures of Bowie from his Hunky Dory phase through his Thin White Duke incarnation. Good for the serious collector only."
1,Not recommended,"I bought a Creative Products Computer Lap Desk (identical to the one shown, except it is hunter green) in a local mall and noticed that my computer tended to move on the surface. Once, when I shifted position, it nearly slid off and onto the floor! Examining the desk, I noticed that the plastic surface was convex and that the four rubber feet on my laptop computer were not touching. Very risky placing a $3500 computer on this thing."
3,BIZARRE HORROR,"BLOOD BEAST HAS ITS MOMENTS,BUT COULD HAVE USED SOME HEAVY EDITING.THE BEAST OF THE TITLE IS A GARGOYLE WITH A HISTORY OF KILLING THRU''ACCIDENTS'',BUT IS NOT FULLY ALIVE UNTIL THE END.IN BETWEEN HIS CREATION AND THE BOOKS CLIMAX WE GET INSIGHT AND TECHNICAL DETAIL ABOUT MACHINE SHOPS,FACTORIES ANDTOOL AND DIE MANUFACTURING.THIS GOES ON FOR QUITE A LARGE PORTION OF THE BOOK[ONE OF THE BEASTS HENCHMEN WORKS AT THIS TYPE OF JOB],AND ITS JUST A WASTE. SOME READERS WILL WANT TO STICK AROUND FOR THE TWISTED CONCUSION TO ALL THIS,THOUGH.D'AMMASSA IS BETTER AT SHORT STORIES, AND THIS BOOK PROVES IT."
5,smells great,"I am makin my own hot tooth picks.. soaking them in this oil. not sure how long or if they will need to dry after a good long soak, but the stuff tastes like it should. cant wait to try em."
3,Ordered for Christmas Pine Cones,My fault but I ordered this too late to arrive in time for reason to use. Still sealed and packed away for Christmas season 2013. It's okay only because I have not used it yet. :)
4,Great oil,The LorAnn Cinnamon Oil came quickly and is exactly what I wanted when I ordered it. It will come in handy for the candy product I am making.
4,Solid all around,"A very solid record, not a bad track found here. This is not music you would listen to with friends, but it is perfect for mornings or evenings alone as well as for driving at night. I think the song ""the Equator"" is the finest electronic song I have ever heard. I imagine this would be the music that would play in the background of a movie as someone ran through the rain forest at night. Very vibrant and imaginative textures. You won't be dissapointed."
4,album...... it's a concrete puzzle,"tnt, hides a conceptual sound, between slow beats and electronical arrangements. And now, when you listen all the songs, (in order),1,2,3,4 etc....,you don't find this conceptual sound,i believe that! but if you make your own order (it's obviusly),then you can find some kind of personal map, keeping the integrity of the abstraction that you have created!"
5,NOW THIS IS A REAL CD!,"This album really grows on you, and is far denser than it sounds initially. TNT seems almost epic, not in length, but in the places it goes from beginning to end. ""The Suspension Bridge at Iguazu Falls"" is one of the heaviest songs I've ever heard. It sounds like a cross beetween the fast music from the japanimation masterpiece ""Akira""(during the motorcycle chases), and the theme from ""The Endless Summer"", conjoined by the blissful minnimalism of Miles Davis's ""In A Silent Way"" These guys used to be Slint?! They've gone from art rock from hell to the only good band on the Thrill Jockey label. And not one bad song in between, still retaining their artfully exicuted, and self aware pretentiousness. REMEMBER: THIS ALBUM WAS MEANT TO BE LISTENED TO ON VINYL."
5,brillant post-rock,"after a plesant listening of ""millions now living must never die"" ,i expected a lot from tortoise.hopefully, TNT doesn't let me down.compared to mogwai,i think the music of tortoise has more textures&variety,& their creativity seems endless .though i prefer mogwai better."
5,My favorite Tortoise,"Out of the four Tortoise albums, I think this is the best. The first two Tortoise albums stood out for their extremely sparse and dry sound but on TNT, the production is much lusher and the group fills up a lot more of the sonic space. New elements like IDM and lounge music mix with the traditional Tortoise trademarks (twangy guitars, cinematic grandeur, chugging rhythms, chiming tuned percussion). The album is all over the map stylistically but manages to weave a coherent tapestry of sound. Definitely a fun album to listen to whether you are studying, driving, or simply watching the old lava lamp."
3,Short annotation of Lee Thomas' biography on Billy Sunday,"The sequel to Thomas` earlier work The Billy Sunday Story. The front cover has shadows of Billy Sunday and Billy Graham in famous preaching positions, displaying ""the first Billy"" as the forerunner to the evangelistic crusades of Graham. Less critical work than Thomas` first work covering the life and message of Sunday."
5,Retro Fancy,"Used, obviously, to hold ice-cream cones, which it does. It's the simplicity (beauty) of the design that makes it stand out."
5,What a great idea,I think this is an excellent idea for drying home made waffle cones - no flat side. Celiacs can now have ice cream cones.
4,Nice ring - but invoice inside led to customs problems,With the product everything is OK but the invoice was inside the package and not outside (as it should have ben for international shippins). It got stuck in the customs and I had to pay an extra fee for every day in the customs' storage until I was able to pick it up... could be improved organization-wise...
1,Terrible product,Package not familiar upon receipt. Inserted cartridge and trouble began. Wouldn't print! Purchased another cartridge elsewhere and all is fine. Would have returned it but didn't have packaging. Never thought I'd have a problem. This is rated ZERO stars!
1,Bad Ink cartridge,I just opened the cartridge this morning to be used. The cartridge is damaged and leaked in the foil wrapper. I was very surprised and got a lot of ink on my hands. I want to know who I can ship this back to to get a refund? I never had this problem with buying via Amazon before! I guess I can only trust brick and mortar stores! Please let me know to wh and how to ship this bad cartridge to![...]
5,LEXMARK CARTRIDGES,I HAVE USED LEXMARK PRODUCTS FOR OVER 15 YEARS AND IT HAS GIVEN THE BEST PERFORMANCE OF ANY PRINTER I HAVE SEEN.
1,Ink leaked,The ink leaked all over the printer and made a mess. Threw it away and had to purchase another catridge locally
4,Does the job,The Lexmark cartridges provide crisp clear images on the paper and last as long as other brands of ink -- wish they all lasted longer.
5,Lexmark 44XL is the only way to go --,"Given that your Lexmark printer accepts the 40 series cartridges, by all means get the high-yield ones. And get them as inexpensively as possible, as I did. GREAT!"
1,Ran out of ink quickly,Shipped from Infinite-Surplus. Ran out of ink after printing approx 50 pages of regular text!
1,uh that was fast!,"As one of the reviewers said, it runs out fast! 50 pages or so -.- for that price i expected more juice."
1,Defective,"This is a problem with the manufacturer, not the vendor. I have received two of these cartridges from two different vendors and both had the same problem -- the tape that covers the ink jets (and prevents leaking in transit)were attached on the side of the cartridge opposite the jets. It looks like an assembly person was just sticking them on mindlessly not knowing the tapes purpose. Ink was all over the place when I opened the sealed bag containing the cartridge. This vendor gave me a refund."
3,Its not What U think it is!!!,although this may seem great because it has so many great games... in reality there are only a total of like 10 fun games (which u can play online for free or buy on a different CD-ROM). so my suggestion to u is... dont buy it... save your money for something addictive like the sims 2!!!
2,Quality/Usability,"I would recommend staying away from any of these Pilot shift knobs. It looks good but that's where your satisfaction will end. Installation/mounting utilizes 3 small Allen set screws which are to be tightened to the shifter rod. One or two shifts and it is loose. Retighten and they strip the soft body metal of the knob. Re-tapping and using larger screws is to no avail. It immediatley loosens, unless you do not touch the knob, then rattles on the shift lever until it drives you nuts and give up and throw it in the trash."
2,Muy buena fotografia,"En la foto se ve mucho mejor de lo que en realidad es. La parte superior que simula fibra de carbono no luce nada real y esta mal pegada, tanto que para no perder mi dinero la despegue y cambie por una metalica que hice."
1,Trash,I don't know if it's a coating or what but it looked scratched after driving to the store. If this is carbon Fiber it does not look like it. Black and chrome checkerd foil is more like it. Poorly thought out it mounts with 3 set screws and I could use only 1 because the chrome base has to be screwed over them after mounting. The set screws will blimish your shift rod. I would send it back but I feel somewhat resposible since I did mount the thing.
3,Its ok...,I gave it to my dad as a bday present and i installed it properly and tightly.. But the second day it ripped right off...
5,A PEAK BACK IN TIME,"A amazing collection of essays, articles and reporting on and about the 1930s. The authors range from John Steinbeck, Paul Gallico, John Toland, Eric Sevareid, and Arthur Schlesinger to whoever. A regular who's who of discerning witnesses."
5,"Managerial Accounting, 9th edition","This is an outstanding book, which covers complex topics on a very friendly manner. Maybe for some readers this book may seem hard to understand, so I strongly recommend everybody to think over the necessity of studying managerial accounting. For me as a person who works with internal finance and who makes prompt decisions upon raw timely data, the book was a relief. It covers such immensely important topics as break-even, leverage, cost behavior and structure, and so forth. One suggestion, do not learn everything by heart, it's useless. You never learn everything in managerial accounting. Use the book as a reference for your everyday needs. Good luck."
2,Why buying books from amazon .com,hi just to let you guys know that i found a lot of your books are more expensive than my damn book store at my school for some reason for example this book managerial accounting for Mr Garrison is 87.00 at my school book store but at your sale it is more than a hundred as a used one can some body fix this stuff or you guys going to let a thrifty customer like me run a way from your web site .
4,Shipping,"Product was shipped early, but I didn't receive unitl 1.5 wks later. Probably the Postal Service."
1,"Wow, Buyer beware - NO DVD as advertised","Wow, Buyer beware.The DVD does NOT come with this book.The DVD promoted on Roman numeral page v as free with the book does NOT come with the book and CANNOT be obtained.the good folks at Amazon were blindsided by the publishers.The publisher blew me off like dandruff on a dark suit when I requested the DVD. I even faxed the page out of the book that boasts about the DVD.Wow, Buyer beware. You will never get the DVD promoted as free with book.But if you are willing to pay extra $$$ you might get some secret special on-line help. But hey, wasn't I promised, written in the book, a free DVD?Oh yeah, well they lied about that. Just cough up more than you paid for the book and they will give you on-line support, promise.Fool me once."
5,Managerial Account Book,perfect condition. Delivery on time.One of the best book absolutely useful for whom are of interested on study Managerial Account either for busienss or for MBA.
3,When purchasing any text for school...,"When purchasing any texts for school, please do not cheap out on paying for faster shipping. Trust me, it will be in your best interests to get 1 day shipping. I waited a little over 2 weeks to get 1 text and the book was being shipped within state."
2,A college student's opinion on this book,"The good part of the book was the fact that it came with a cd-rom. The bad part was that it was very hard to understand, even when the professor tried to explain the concepts behind what the authors were saying. Budgeting was the toughest chapter to understand because it seemed like each of the 10 concepts in that chapter weren't explained enough for me nor any of my classmates to understand."
3,"Dense, Reference Only",This book is just ok. I've seen better. The content is dense and may be useful for a reference for accountants - which I'm not. I tried to sell it but no one will take it even as just a year old. I'd rather Google the things I'll need than to try to intrepret it from this book.
1,Not worth the money,This book was required for the class I took. The Ready Notes is a bound set of Powerpoint slides (3 per page). The instructor did not use the entire set of slides. I could have taken notes during the lecture and saved the money.
1,Quite disappointed with the seller.,"This book I bought, was marked as ""Brand New"" by the seller, but in fact, it is a used one and even with somebody's name written on the cover page! I feel cheated and quite disappointed with the seller!"
4,Unique blend of trance and tribal music. Nothing else like it.,"Many trance music cds have similar instruments, just different rythms and some even with words. The didgeridoo experience is different in its ""african beat"" origins. There are no words, just human sounds and vibrating musical instruments. May I suggest you listen to a few sample songs, to get a feeling. If this sound is very different, then you will eventually become amazed at its inspiring results -- when you listen to it for a while. Not for a crowded party room, but for one on one listening. Can not be used as background music either. So, be ready to get consumed into the trance and melodies. Maybe it will bring out the animal in you."
5,Bangin!,This is absolutely a Fantastic album. I love the beats and and the didge rhythms. It's a really great collection.
3,Biggie biggie iz da bomb!,Great cd but all the songs are Radio Edit. So if you are in to that it is good but if you are not in to the radio edit thing don't get it. But the last song on here Skys the limit is a cool mix. It is sad he is not here! I think that there is not one day that goes by that I don't listen to him!
5,Biggie Smalls is Very positive!,this some has to be one of the most positive and touchin' song's he has ever recorded cause I was moved by his words and about how he made it to the game. He was a very good storyteller and this cd single give's you an insight on how great this rapper was.
1,"Worst movie EVER! Yes, I said, ""EVER!""","Do not buy this POS on ANY format! It is without a doubt the worst acted, worst directed, worst written and worst filmed so-called movie I have ever seen in my life and I have seen alot of bad movies. It's a travesty that this was even released on Blu Ray at all. The PQ on this is horrendous! I just wish I could give this zero stars because I surely would.Trust me, instead of wasting your money on this thing, put gas in your car or go buy yourself dinner. There are way better things to do with 90 minutes of your life than submit to this."
1,Ultimate Farce aka Disappointment of the year,"This movie has the biggest delta between the description on Amazon and the actual content of the movie. Unlike Hong Kong B movies, this title has not only poor acting, poor lines, and crappy camera work, but also surprisingly bad picture quality. I kept thinking that I could have done a better job with an analog video camera from 1988.The ""action"" in the movie is bordering on the ridiculous. For example in the opening scene the main character easily overwhelms a half a dozen guards with a suppressed pistol, even though all of the guards were within ten or so yards of each other. This is followed by an execution scene that borders on the comical. And it doesn't get any better.Short version: save your money."
1,DEATH IS NOT AN ENDING. IT IS A DOOR.,"Sphinx (Mirko Cro Cop Filipovic) is an assassin, one that was ""made"" like Jason Bourne. He is a rather large and ominous person dressed in black, clearly the assassin in the room. He has a pet rat which he seems to care for in a bad ""gerbil"" sort of way. After he fails to kill a woman witness, he is sent off to an island where he exhibits some of the worse on screen kick boxing since Pam Grier stopped making films.You might find parts of the film funny for the wrong reason. I thought the metal soundtrack and basic plot outline were passable, they just couldn't do anything with it.No f-bombs, sex, or nudity."
4,Ultimate Force Cro Cop,"This movie is under rated! Forget anything about the story line or acting. If you are a student of film,look at the camera shots, angles, edits etc. Very, very good. Cro cop's acting could could use a littlemore mentoring, but for a professional fighter, he was very good. The other actors were up to par.The only real problem I had with this movis was the violence in the church at the ending. If you likeCroatia, buy this movie and work a little to understand what went into making it!!Fini"
1,Worst film I have seen,This is one of the worst films I have seen my whole life. Can't believe that someone wanted to have it in Blu-Ray.
2,"""Ultimate Force""","Dear Amazon:The movie ""Ultimate Force"" was a movie made for action/martial arts lovers with a B movie cast and production. I was expecting better since I bought it in the Blu-Ray DVD format; a bit of a let down.The actors are Eastern European and of the old Soviet Russia extracts; poor acting by unknown actors in other words. The color quality is very poor, but plenty of action from start to finish for all the action pack lovers.MarioConcord, CA."
1,Lens cap does not fit polarizer,"Canon makes several excellent lenses that use 77 mm filters. One would think that Canon would ensure that the 77 mm lens cap would fit over the polarizer filter. Surprise, it does not!! This is a serious defect with this expensive filter. Without being able to protect the filter with a lens cap, my filter has gotten seriously scratched. The filter itself is of high quality."
2,"Poor Quality, Raised Seams","I was surprised at how raised the seams were around the toes. Even with loose slippers they immediately cut into the top of my toes - I cannot image wearing regular shoes. The socks quickly stretch out of shape, regardless of size, and you can also see multiple defects that they tried to cover up ... kind of like what you would do by hand to fix a hole. Oh well, the search goes on."
3,ok,100% cotton and sock stays up too.these are good if synthetic materials bother your skin. they are also made in usa.
3,A thicker sock,This item is ok and was too thick for me. I would recommend it for one who like a thick sock. Bob K
4,Beautiful Tahitian Pearl Necklace,Not a perfect black pearl but beautiful design and my daughter loves it.
2,Amoral,"I read ""Blasted"" which is one of her most well known pieces. I found it be overly violent and crude. I do not expect every drama to be pure and innocent, but I found the extravagant immorality disgusting. Sarah Kane is obviously a talented writer, and I wish she did not add obscenity to deepen her plot."
3,An interesting thought experiment--Does it fail?,"Sarah Kane's plays are crass, bleak, bland, not lyrical and certainly not beautiful, neither philosophical nor reflective. She's a reactionary. She's visceral. She's base in the truest sense, like blood, or a seizure, not quite an orgasm. There's no ecstasy in her world.You might not respect her...and maybe you shouldn't. Maybe she doesn't want you to.But read her, anyway. If only to find fault with her attempts. Pick her apart.She's nothing if not an engaging read.In fact, she may in fact be--in the nihilist sense of the word--nothing....Read her anyway."
5,"Great little lamp, great price","This lamp is small but as cute as can be, and looks great on my lanai"
4,shredding guitar & great songs - MAGNITUDE 9,"shredding guitar playing , great songs ....a really good melodic metal disc....reminds me of fates warning - yngwie - artension-queensryche....a solid debut"
4,MAGNITUDE 9 impressed me,"This is a pretty good debut cd indeed ....... its good to see talented metal bands still exist ! ....I recomend this cd ,...if you appriciate new,upcoming groups ....you should like MAGNITUDE 9 ...they remind me of queensryche in some ways ..other ways ...like yngwie malmsteen ...other ways dream theater ...all rolled into one ,....Ill give it 4 STARS."
4,November Kicks Yet AGAIN!,"A beautiful release by Lorna. Every track is shimmering perfection. I don't rightly know what to say to inspire you to buy this CD except that if you are a fan of indie-pop to begin with (as I am), then this will be a perfect addition to your collection which undoubtedly already includes works by Scarboro Aquarium Club, Testbild! Harper Lee, etc... Also, keep an eye out for Lorna's November Kicks Again single. Beauty incarnate!"
5,Excellent,I bought this CD because I heard one of the songs at the end of movie (Dreamer) and decided to investigate the other songs on the CD. I was not disappointed and ended up buying two additional CDs after listening to a sampling of them on Amazon.com
2,Product Description Misleading,No issue with the product per se. It is just that the product description is wrong. This item is located behind the radio on car equiped with manual air conditioning controls. You need a special tool to pull the radio out of the dash ( Amazon sells this too). Has to return the item since it was not what I needed.
2,Nice but not necessary,"Fred the talking garbage can is cute, and I assumed because my son loved the broom he would love the garbage can but honestly, it scared him and he prefers to sweep and dump the garbage in the BIG garbage can. Not necessarily and engaging as the broom."
1,Nitro is a waste of cash.,"First of I must say that I really feel like I threw my hard earned cash away when I purchased Nitro. For one thing the playibility is horrible and performing a single regular move like a suplex is immpossible. Hell every move is immpossible because if you are facing the computer, the other charcter will constantly grab you while you are trying to perform your moves. Also what really sucks, is the hidden wrestlers. I like the roster but the wrestlers dont sport their own signature moves just someone elses. For example Roddy Piper is a hidden character and his finisher is called ""the Piper Clutch."" What this moves is what I remember is Chris Benoit's Crippler Crossface. To put in hardcore terms DONT EVEN RENT THIS GAME. If you must then I say let the buyer and the renter BEWARE."
3,Needs polish,"The play control needs work, but the graphics are surprisingly good. It reminded me of a Genisis wrestling game from awhile ago. If you're not a hardcore wrestling fan, you probably won't think much of it. I thought it was okay."
3,Cool and Uncool,Just OK for basketball practice like shooting and other stuffs. But for game proper i dont advise using this ball.
1,Poor Quality,We just received this DVD and the quality is so poor that we couldn't watch it. It is blurry and makes a person sea sick trying to focus on the scenes. We also ordered vol. 4 of the Best of Abbott and Costello and the movies are sharp and clear. Would have given it a lower score but there is no lower score. Completely useless!
4,Funny,"I loved Abbot & Costello as a kid, so got this and one of their ""scary"" ones for my kids. At first they had to get used to it, but ultimately loved it:)"
4,Jack's a classic !,"Remembered this movie all these years ago, (approaching 60,) because it's one that sticks with you. Jack is the ever polite, honest, giving, protective boy who strives for everything good and rich in life. Because he believes the best in all people, the ordinary beans become magical. My grandkids faces were a sight as I watched them watch this movie, answering their innocent questions. The youngest used to watch ""Cars"" everynight before going to sleep; now it's ""Jack."" That says something about old movies. The songs ""I fear nothing when I'm in the right"" and ""He never looked better in his life"" were great. And for the price I paid, a real deal."
2,DEFECTO,"EL RADIO PRESENTA PROBLEMAS EN EL SITIO DE CONEXION DE LOS AUDIFONOS,SOLO SE ESCUCHA SI SE INSERTA HASTA LA MITAD, SI SE INSERTA TODO EL PIN, SOLO SE ESCUCHA POR UN AURICULAR"
3,Still another beginner oriented bowling book,"There's nothing wrong with working on the basics, but this book is very much directed to people who can't average 170.Reviewing basics is fine and if you aren't to that 170 level you could do worse than to buy this book. If you are already better than that, forget it, save your money."
1,Save your money.,"There's almost nothing in this book that I could find useful. Even for a beginner this book speaks in generalisms and ambiguities. In most respects, it seems the author's position is that you should do whatever works for you with very little more guidance. I'm moving on to look for a useful book."
2,Hated it,"This book was so tedious, it was almost painful to read. The characters were one-dimensional, the plot was predictable and sometimes ridiculous. Worse, its message is that if you aspire to something more than a ghetto existence, you can expect alienation and death!"
4,The Potential is there...,"I haven't fully heard the whole CD, but I must say Canibus has strong potential, but must focus less on bragging about himself anf how dope he is, but stick to intelligent constructive concepts, because he is already spreading good message. Lyrically he got skills, but gotta speak from the heart, not try to commercialize! Decent CD, beats are decent, lyrics as well, looking forward to the return of the poet! [...]Peace And Respect to all, 1,Gorilla"
3,not quite my flavour but I can see why he does it,"Canibus is an independent artist. fans of the hardcore canibus seem to complain about albums that they think are less than they expect. Why always expect more of the same? why not allow experimentation? isn't variety the spice of life? true fans know that he has still got it, as the ""cloak and dagga"" release proves. I admire the fact that he tries different things and although I myself might not think that it is as good as his best stuff, I also appreciate that there is a whole market of fans who are not ready for the hardcore lyrical assasin that canibus can be. Why should he choose whether to either ""sell out or be underground""? why not keep as many fingers in as many pies as possible?canibus, just keep doing your thing!"
2,Will the Real Canibus Please Stand Up!!,"I really want to show love to Biz, but his last two efforts have been a huge let down. This is mixtape material, not the classic sound we are accustomed to hearing. I think Canibus really needs to sit down and choose what direction he wants to going in. Either, you go back to being the underground legend we loved in Rip the Jacker, 2000 b.c, mic club, etc or you sell your soul completely by searching for help from clowns like Kanye--look what he did with previous underground dudes like Common."
4,Lyrics !,"OKay. let's start off with the obvious. production is lacking. Nottz's style of production sounds too ""mickey mousey"" for canibus. Production is average at best but mostly boring and sounds to easy to produce. Now the great part of this album: his lyrics. This is the Canibus we all know. it wasn't his greatest outing but is much better than C-true Hollywood Stories.... It was great to hear Canibus again. and with average beats- he stills stands out."
1,nmini madeleine pan,"it is very small and difficult to load the mixture.Better purchase the bigger one, which is easier to work with."
2,Too Late to Cry-AWB,"I don't think I ever heard this album, it couldn't have been too popular, because I was listening to all types of music ""back in the day""."
1,Not right at all,"It wasn't the product displayed at all.I was hoping for the link cable to transfer my pokemon from gold to sapphire so I could put them on the newer system games.The cord sent out was for a gameboy advance only, not for Gameboy color, pocket or regular like I wanted.But I did get my money back... or rather a voucher for another purchase"
5,the gameboy wire,i chose the rating because its useful for the game boy generation not advance really comes in handy when trading or playing a gameboy
2,Read product description very carefully...,"First I'll admit I don't know much about buying fishing/crabbing gear. I was trying to buy the ""perfect"" father's day gift. Please pay extra attention that the net is just an attachment...THE POLE IS SOLD SEPAREATELY!!!! Also Amazon.com through Boater's World doesn't sell the needed Shurhold Telescoping Handle..I have checked both the amazon.com for the product and have gone through boatersworld.com to locate the product. I did however contact my local Boater's World and they have the handle. Bottom Line the item (to me) seems a bit pricy... $19.99 + 6.95 (shipping) for the net & $26.99 + tax seems to be a lot of money for a simple crabbing net! Hope the product last! Feeling kinda cheated for the amount of money that I spent..."
1,Do not order!,"I ordered this magazine as a gift for X-Mas in 2005, the money was taken from my account immediatly, but the product was never shipped. Didn't realize this until the recipiant of this gift called me. I was informed that he was getting billed for his own X-Mas gift! Which he never recieved! Tried many times to locate a number for this company, and had to make LOTS of calls to find a valid phone number. Anyways, finially he recieved mag in JULY! And forget the cookbook that was supposed to be free with subscription, that never came. Unfortunatly I have already been billed AGAIN after only 6 issues. AND the phone number listed on the new bill, invalid.....again."
3,"Good introduction, but that's it","This thin book is a good introduction to the idea of that you should make good software interfaces, but doesn't tell you how to do that. For that, Spolsky provides an excellent bibliography at the end.If you already have even a little bit of experience with good interface design, this book isn't for you. It's there to enlighten the programming masses that so far don't care or haven't been told that users matter.You can get this book for free online starting at Joel on Software (I think Amazon deleted the URL I put in there, but google for the book title and you'll find it)."
3,Fun to read,"Lots of great stories and examples, good illustration though at times it seems quite disjoint with the text and just thrown in for example's sake.Overall not a whole lot there though. A great idea if it were better executed. Lots of fluff, unfilled pages and wide spacing make for a quick read and empty feeling."
4,Great way to get introduced ...,"Not only is `User Interface Design for Programmers' a fun read, but it's also a fun way to get introduced to the world of user interface design.It teaches you the basics of UI thinking, while at the same time keeping the ""level"" high enough for more experienced designers to like it."
3,Very well written but it seems like something is missing.,"Many of us have come to expect very good writing from Joel, and this book delivers. Joel writes in an engaging style and provides us with proper examples to get his point across. The book is divided into properly named sections with titles that we have come to expect from Joel, such as ""People can't read"", ""People can't remember"" and ""People can't control the mouse"". All of which bring up important issues that seem to come up for me in UI design.However, when I was done with this book, I felt like something was missing. Because the book is more of a collection of tips rather than a unit by itself. In my opinion, this fact makes this book lose some ""flow"". (This style fits into ""Joel on Software"" though)Overall, I think it's a good book to start you off with UI design but definitly not the only resource you should have access to."
3,Not as good as the website,"I'll admit that I have read Joel's book before .. on his website. Reading it in print was a different experience. Frankly, I expected MORE from something that I can sit on the toilet and read. It's written like a weblog .. which is fine for scrolling across the web, but I would agree with one of the other reviewers that the book is not so meaty as it could be .. and relies too heavily on anecdotes.Nonetheless, Joel's insight and matter-of-fact analysis is good, and can be used to effectively convey some basic UI concepts to programmers -- a species usually less than concerned with such issues. Indeed, I have (in a fit of frustrated anger) suggested that several programmers I've been working with take this book home with them one night and not return until it has been read cover-to-cover. It's a quick read, and a good way to hit someone on the head with the UI religion without too much force."
4,Good,"The book covers the basics of UI design. As a software developer I found it a good introduction to some of the basic principles involved. The book is not suitable as a reference work, as it only covers a finite set of ideas, and not in an exhaustive manner. However, the book is well written and does give one a solid foundation on which to build a more in-depth knowledge of UI design."
2,Basic theory in Human Interface Design. Nothing new.,"If you're a beginner in the world of Human Interface Design, this book is for you. If you're a programmer looking to make his/her program more user-friendly, this book is for you. Otherwise, for anyone else, the theory and concepts are basic at best. I'd recommend tracking down the long out of print Apple Computer ""Inside Macintosh"" series of books as they are more detailed and written by some of the pioneers of Human Interface Design.The one redeeming point here is the quality of the screenshots. Very impressive indeed and help to get the point across. Otherwise, you may find this book an entertaining read, but not something you'd learn a great deal from."
4,Margaret's Story - Review,"I would have prefered more history before my purchase but that did not come until I readthe book and then took a tour of Louise's B & B and the hospital. One day, I would liketo research New Switzerland and try to find some of the gravesites on the Island whereMargaret lived with her lovely family.Eugenia Price wrote historically but some fiction/non-fiction. Most interesting."
2,"Lots of pastel sticks broken in pieces, not happy!","I found this set at the local art store with the price $94.00 something, so when I found this on Amazon with 54.99 I was really happy to buy it. However, the order arrived today and I'm totally disappointed, well not because of the quality of the pastel but the condition they are in. Lots of them were broken in pieces, yeah I mean pieces, not broken just in haft or three. I just wondered that is it because of the packaging or u just get what u pay for? Pastel is soft and easy to break, and for this set they come in a cardboard box, not the metal tin one, so I just don't understand why amazon.com don't put it into a box with some protections around instead of just wrapping a piece of cardboard around them then ship for a long way. Totally disappointed with this. I really thought that I would never go wrong with amazon inc. Now I DO."
5,Awesome Product,I ordered these pastels because Prismacolor makes the best of everything they are easy to use and blend and erase. I used them for all my drawings they also do not make to much of a mess and they last a long time this set is great even for a beginner art student the only problem with this set is one of the red pastels it is really waxy but other than that I will defiantly buy another set when I run out.
4,retro fun,"A good yarn about the old days of the Sacramento Delta....a vast and unique group of waterways many Californians don't know exists....a bit simplistic, but interesting book....this copy was a first print, signed by the author."
5,Ooka is still available,"This book may be out of print, but you can get the next best thing: ""Ooka and the Case of the Marble Monster and Other Stories"" - http://www.amazon.com/Case-Marble-Monster-Other-Stories/dp/0590080245"
4,emotion is the order for the day,"If your in the mood for maximum intensity of emotion, this is for you. This album was written about the loss of a wife in a young marriage. The songs, while a bit dark (for obvious reasons )are very moving and easy to connect with. The production quality is amazing, Kip does his own music great justice. All of the musicians do a wonderful job of keeping the athmosphere of each song at a fever pitch. Lush orchestrations and percussion flavor each piece, but not overdoing it. The sounds range from ""Pink Floydish"" to heavy grooves in acoustic mode. One word of warning.....this album is depressing, do not listen to it when in a good mood, ha ha. But if your feeling a loss, or just a case of the blues, light some candles, burn some incense, and embrace a sound that will take your heart and mind on an original journey of heartbreak. Brightest spots are ""Wildflower"" and ""Cross""."
1,no rating,"I purchased a dirt devil M084100 stick sweeper. It was suggested that others bought these filters as well while purchasing the sweeper. I thought this was a good idea, so agreed to purchase them. They were only $5 or $6 so it made sense to buy and ship these under the same order. BE CAREFUL to read the suggested product, in my case the filters that I ordered do not come close to being the correct ones for my vacuum. Make sure you don't take for granted that the selected products are correct, I made this mistake. I'm sure this product will work fine, but I will not be able to use it to know for sure. The filters will probably be scrapped because it will cost me more to return them than they are worth. Save yourself $5 or $6 and make sure you get the right filters."
1,Doesn't Fit Dirt Devil Versa stick,I bought a 2 pack of these filters because they were pictured with the Dirt Devil SD20000RED Versa Power All-in-One Stick Vacuum Cleaner but they don't fit.(You need the Dirt Devil F25 Filter )
1,The wrong filter,"Amazon had this matched with a dirtdevil as a package deal kind of thing. Since I live on a tiny island in the pacific and it is difficult to find such items here, so I bought it. The filters do not fit the Dirtdevil it was paired with."
5,Exactly as expected.,"Arrived promptly and were the OEM filters I expected. I have not used them yet, however I have inspected them closely and have found nothing to indicate they are anything else than as good as what came with the vacuum."
1,Returned,The filters didn't fit the vacuum that I bought. I needed part F-25. I had to re-order the ones I needed. It only came in a package of one.
2,Hard to find correct item,"I did a lot of searching for these filters and ordered the wrong product. These were the wrong filters for my Dirt Devil stick so I really cannot rate them. My fault too since I didn't look at the actual stick, and mine is a ""Versa"" model. All I can say is be smarter than I was and check the model of your Dirt Devil stick. Fortunately the company was willing to give me a refund when I sent them back. I think it is unfair that stores that sell a product do not carry the filters nor be willing to order them."
4,great vaccum,I really like this vaccum. One review I read said they found it really loud I don't think that is true at all it is no louder than any vaccum I have ever used and it picks up the lint and everything better than my big vaccum does and it is very light and easy to use on the stairs.
2,Ok but not great,"We bought this as an alternative to our upright Hoover vacuum which we couldn't use in this house since it is too heavy for the soft hardwood floors and scratches them. We live in a small house (950 sqft) and have 4 cats and a toddler and bought this mainly to pick up cat hair and cat litter.Pros:* lightweight (does not scratch soft hardwood floors) and flexible* quiet* cordless* not very expensive* easy to use and maintain* nice designCons:* mediocre suction (frequently loses stuff, esp. cat litter)* pet hair gets trapped in the brush and the wheels (very annoying!!!)* requires frequent emptying* rapid decline of suction power* does not clean well in cornersBefore we had this, I used an old-fashioned broom to sweep the floors and it didn't take me that much longer to clean the house. I wouldn't buy this again."
3,"Soft blanket, but not as pictured.","This is a very cute, soft blanket I purchased for my cousin's daughter. However, the blanket did not have the crown ""hood"" part as pictured. It was just a plain purple on back and the pink pattern on the other side."
5,A treasure!,"I read and loved this book when I was a kid (MANY years ago) and I still have my copy of the original edition. Recently, I gave it to my 8 year old son to read and he couldn't put it down. He keeps asking me to find more books like this for him. This is a great book for any kid with adventurous spirit and a love of good, old fashioned story telling."
4,Got Penis?,"Ok, those who get squeamish over penis need not apply here. This book is covered in it from cover to cover, and men and women alike will find this an interesting dissection of it. The author gives us a history lesson in the penis from ancient times to the current day erectile dysfunction boom. He focuses quite a bit on Mr. Frued, obviously for the fact that this man was penile fixed and injected his theories right into modern day psychology textbooks. I found the most interesting part regarding the racial penis, as it was a new look at racism in America and abroad.I was a bit disappointed that the book didn't include much pop culture regarding the penis. However, the areas the author chose to look at were very appropriate and provided new insight on that organ both men and women find fascinating."
4,Informative and More than a little Amusing...,"A comprehensive look at the theories and assumptions man has made in study of his most perplexing organ. Including various famous historical figures and their amusing associations about the purpose and inner workings of the penis. Da Vinci, Rousseau,Twain, Whitman, just a few of the cultural geniuses discussed.From demon rod, to gear shift, to holiest of holies, an interesting look at the male fascination with his own genital organs in all their complexity...lol."
5,Left to my own devices...,"The perfrect book for a person jonesing for the complete culutral history of the jock. Well researched and well structured, the book is a comprehisive guide to everything penis. Don't let whimsical chapter titles like ""The Demon Rod,"" ""The Gear Shift,"" and ""The Puncture-proof Balloon"" fool you; this is a work of great socio-political importance. As man has evolved, so has his relationship with his organ, and to understand him, you must understand his member. David M. Friedman has given you the map towards total penile nirvana."
2,Entertaining But Apparently Not A Scholar,"The book is entertaining, however if you wish to read this from a scholarly point of view and you have spent ANY time studying the ancient world to any degree...you will be appauled to find that the author of this book simply added his own interpretations to events, biblical texts, and blatantly stretched (pun so intended) the truth on so much. I'd had enough from a research point of view when this guy not onlt spelt the names of gods wrong, but hyped only childish popular perspectives that no closer resemble ancient Sumerian belief than does the golden arches as a phallic symbol. If you take away any claim of being a historical reference, this book is good. It's a tongue and cheek look on the penis and that is about all it does. Totally not serious, but a giggle to be had here and there. Some of which is at the author's expense."
1,[Could have been a great book],"This is so sad. A fun title, a delightful cover, a goldmine of raw material, but then the actual text is so very tedious. This book could have been thoughtful, but it's not. It is just a few hundred index cards assembled into a book. Incompently hundreds of obvious connections are not drawn. This book could have been amusing, but again and again stories that could have kept the reader in stitches are rendered in text that that has lost the ironic delight I bet their original sources had. The authors of numerious encyclopedias are weeping in their graves. Only the most dedicated reader will find some slight pleasure in this now doubled irony. The book could have been scholarly, but the absense of careful footnotes and careless about the materials leaves the scholar afraid that this is just tainted with urban myths that have rattled down the the ages over beers at the pub after Latin class. What waste! What a great book this might have been!"
3,"Exhaustive, sometimes exhausting...","Everything you ever wanted to know about the penis, much of which is very, very interesting; some of it downright bizarre. Friedman sure has done his research, and takes his subject very seriously. At times, however, his ability to connect the penis to every single important cultural event since the beginning of time strains credulity. (One almosts expects him to connect the male member to Girl Scout cookies and the invention of the toaster.) All in all, a fascinating piece of research, but I did find my attention wandering now and then."
3,A Good Book with a Serious Flaw,"I shall keep this review short. The book is excellently written, is well laid out and contains essential information. The only problem, but its a BIG one, is that the scholarship is shoddy, there are no reference lists, there are many entries that begin ""...scientists these days think..."" with no attribution and it does have American humour. If you want an easy reading book that is humourous, not hard work but essentially unsatisfying....this is the one!"
5,Great for any snare work,"I grew up in high school and junior high playing snare in a drumline. We used a very different model back then, but I was intrigued by the idea of a persimmon wood stick and I wanted something to build chops and muscle back. These work wonderfully on all those scores. Not sure how the sticks will hold up against heavy duty rimshots, but I suspect quite well."
2,watch out,"The pots are nice, But there must have been a crack in the glass lid. While cooking sauce the lid shattered and then exploded right in my face. please look over the lids carefully after delivery."
2,Save your money; use the 'Net,I found this book to be fairly worthless in planning my trip to Spain. The pictures and descriptions are far less than what is freely available on the internet.
5,Great media,"I originally got these disks because I was having trouble with my car's cd player skipping with regular silver disks. I read on the internet that black disks can track better and sure enough, all burns have played perfectly. I have used 4 or 5 different drives (from cheap OEM drives to Plextor) and they all worked. These are the only disks I use for music cd's anymore."
4,Great quality - hard to label,"I haven't had a bad CD in the bunch yet, and the black color is very classy looking. However, since the entire CD is black, there's no place to write a label! As everyone knows, sticking a label on a CD is a bad idea because it unbalances the rotation of the CD and there's a chance that the label will come off inside the player, so that's not an option.They've left an area for a label - all they have to do is make it a color that a permanent marker can be read from."
2,not even cool...,"i bought a pack of these at office max or something like that and i was all uber excited to release band demos on a black cd, how cool is that right? well i come to find much to my disay that my cd drive does not recognize them , NONE of them worked. on any other computer either. no idea what the problem is but ive never had that happen before with a brand new pack of cdr's , the site was pretty helpful and they say they are sending a brand new pack in a few weeks... .free of charge looks like. cant beat the service. ill give these another try, they look awesome and sound great... when they work"
1,Won't Work In Older Drives,"I bought these cause they are cool looking, but it ended up being a waste of money. If your burner isn't brand spanking new it doesn't even recognize the disc. I don't know why the silver ones will work but these wont! Sucks."
1,Macbookpro of Pioneer CDjs will not read these discs,Simply my mac book pro and my pioneer cdjs will not read these discs. bad product
1,doesn't work on macs,"i bought these because bright green is my favorite color and it looks really good with the black!!but that seems to be all they are good for.if you have a mac, DO NOT BUY THESE!!my friend used to have these and they worked on her dell computer, though, so they aren't completely useless."
1,Does not work in Mac's,"I purchased this product to burn cd's for my legally purchased digital music from iTunes and Amazon. I can not create cd's using the superdrive that came installed in my MacBook. I have also read where users are experiencing the same problem on MacBook Pros. The media is cool to look at, but it simply does not work using the built in drive superdrive. I spoke with Apple support and they offered to replace the drive under warranty, however, I have had my MacBook for less than two months and this media has been available for a few years. The tech support representative stated he did not know if the replacement drive would be newer or resolve the problem. Luckily I have an external Sony DVD burner that works fine with the media. However, I can make audio cd's using the external drive instead of the internal."
1,0-STARS - THE WORST CD'S I HAVE EVER HAD!,"EVERYONE BE CAREFUL. AFTER READING POSITIVE REVIEWS I WAS VERY EXCITED AND BOUGHT A PACK OF THESE COOL LOOKING CD'S.WELL I HAVE TO SAY I HAD NEVER SO MANY BAD CD'S IN A PACK! EVER!IT TAKES SOMETIMES 3 OR 4 BAD CD'S BEFORE I BURN A GOOD ONE. AND I HAVE TO BURN ON A SLOWER SPEED. VERY FRUSTRATING. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY DRIVE. THEY ARE JUST NOT THAT COMPATIBLE AS THE MANUFACTURE SAYS. MY NEW SONY WAIO LAPTOP DOESN'T EVEN REGISTER THAT THE DISC IS IN. SO, IF YOU WANA SAVE YOURSELF LOT'S OF HEADAKE DON'T BUY THESE."
1,DONT BUY,"If Amazon had a 0 star rating, thats what I would give this item. Memorex claims that it will work in all CD drives, and that the black plastic doesn't effect the CD. They are lying! I put one of these into my 2 year old CD drive, it made the ""My Computer"" screen go corrupt. I tried to burn a file onto it, my drive messed up and the CD no longer worked."
4,Classic album,"If you are looking for the missing link between PiL, Jane's Addiction and Led Zeppelin, you might have stumbled on it here. This album rocks like a melon farmer, and will take you to a higher plane.Best tracks are 'Welcome to the North' and 'Freedom Fighters', which sound almost as good as they do live. If you get a chance to do so, you should see them live - they are absolutely amazing: ugliest lead singer since Al Jourgensen, but the funkiest rock sound since Sly and the Family Stone or Parliament.With the UK music scene stronger than it has been in a long time, groups like Franz Ferdinand, The Libertines, Kasabian, Keane, etc are blazing new trails. But the Music are not resting on their laurels. This is party music to blow your mind, as well as your speakers."
2,Not Compatable With Windows Vista or 7,"Apparently after messing with it for more than 5 hours, I finally get a hold of tech support to discover that it is not Compatible with Windows Vista. Be Warned because it does not say this on the item description and specs. Nor does it say this on the product due to the fact that this was created while XP was the latest version of windows.Oh and they have no intention of updating their drivers and will refuse to reimburse you for the product. Perhaps the Amazon seller will but the company that made it won't. Buyer Beware!"
3,It's okay,"Not sure what to do with it. Driver had acted up a bit. As handset worked okay, as speakerphone not so hot. I guess it would be useful to use as another interface on another running instance of Skype. Good idea for a product but needs some refining in the audio dept. The other parties heard me okay (they said sound quality was decent), but on my end was so-so. Neat that it stores and charges in laptop, but it is the older full sized form factor."
3,it's good,i like this phone it's good and you can using with msn and yahoo and specially with skype VOIP10000xxx amazon
4,Loud and nasty,"I loaned these guys the money to make their first demo tape; then they tried to SELL me a copy. They have an incredibly talented drummer and a dazzling guitarist (cute as hell, too). Their bass player rocks (Hi, Blondie). The music is loud and nasty, fast and sometimes funny. I don't know if the band is still around. I heard they changed their name. We're not friends any more. It's still a good CD. Appropriate for keggers or other chaotic functions."
2,Disappointing except as a quickstart guide,"Although marketed as a ""quickstart"" guide, I was disappointed at the lack of technical and explanatory text. Data rate is an important variable using Premiere, yet Bolante discounts a discussion of the complex topic by referring the reader back to Adobe's user guide and online help system...two pieces of the product that encouraged me to run screaming for better information. Bolante's book tends toward linear instruction (i.e., do this, then this, then this...) and is best used, indeed, as only a quick start tool."
3,Premiere 5.1 Mac Windows: Visual QuickStart Guide,The book is difficult to understand if you have no traditional video editing experience. There is an opportunity for someone to write a more comprehensive manual.
1,Did not work,I got this a long time ago to learn Premiere.I tried it in different computers but never got the cd to work.
2,Very Disappointing,I have to agree with the previous reviews. I am a fan of the visual quick start books but this book was grossly disappointing. As a reference book it is in sore need of better indexing. As a training book there isn't the cohesion the other visual quick start books seem to have. I could not recommend this book
5,COOLEST Cd-Player In THE UNIVERSE,"This player is awesome. It pumps out incredible sound and also is very efgfiecient with the remote control. The ESP2 works real well and practically elimanates skips, unless you hurl it across a room. Do yourself a favor and buy this player. The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't come with radio."
2,Great product except where it counts.,"The styling and features of this model are top-notch. However, even the slightest movement and it skips (and skips and skips), making it impossible to walk with. My girlfriend has the D-E705 which takes some serious effort to make it skip. Do yourself a favor, buy a Sony, just not this model."
4,A good CD player,"Despite the criticisms on the other reviews I've found the ESP2 shock protection works pretty well. To be fair to Sony, they do say somewhere in the blurb that it's not suitable for jogging. I've just tried giving it a fairly good shaking and it won't skip. Perhaps there were problems with earlier versions or something? It's small, light, and yep the case will mark fairly easily, but it sounds good and for me the sound it produces is the most important thing. I ditched the supplied phones and got something better (for my taste) but your mileage may vary"
3,A tragic gutting of a great story.,"This is a servicable abridgement, easy to read and an okay place to start for non-native speakers of Spanish, in their second or third year of study. However, the editor sees fit to interrupt the narrative every page and a half with notes in English. The most galling aspect is the study questions in Spanish after each chapter, which ask about information introduced in the English language notes. Keep looking for a good edition, this isn't it."
4,good condition,"this book is in good condition...i think even new, cant remy. It has side marginal notes to help those learning spanish"
4,Great once you know the basics,Use this book once you have Pence's basic HTML book down. It will provide many new tools to spruce up your exist web programming.
4,the olsens still rock!!!,"I sad when this show first aired because i was sad that it didnt show the girls in real life but i still love this!!!a must have for olsen fans!!!love , mk and ashley number 1 fan"
3,Sphinx,The Sphinx is a very old movie that I remembered from 30? years ago. Good Egyptian backgrounds and I liked the actors. I had read the book by Robin Cook first and enjoyed the mystery. My husband that it was a mediocre story. Three stars for us. The tape is very scratchy and I hope it holds together to watch it again.
3,Sphinx,"Although I had seen this on TV before, I was not prepared for how many times Lesle-Ann Down screams in this film. I believe she was cast for her screaming. I was also not prepared for how bad an actress she was in this film. The plot was good, but the acting overall was terrible."
3,Sphinx,"I sew ths movie meany years ago, and I found that I liked it very much, there are actor in it that I like from other movies,it does not have the special afects of today but for it's time it is quite good."
4,"Movie is great, but the new Amazon DVD is blank. . .","I love this movie and have waited for it to come out on DVD for several years. Finally, this year it was produced and I ordered it from Amazon the last week of November. However, when I received my copy, the DVD stopped and was totally blank after 11 seconds. All it contained was the video pirating message. I returned it easily and Amazon promptly send a replacement which also proved to be blank after exactly 11 seconds. I have sent it back for a refund. I do not fault Amazon, however, since both were brand new and still in the plastic wrapper. I assume this was an error in production and wonder how many blank DVDs there are out there. I'm also wondering when I will be able to order another DVD which actually contains the movie. Beware if you are ordering this DVD now. . . looks like there are still 37 left in this batch as of 12/7/11."
5,Definately Interesting and thought provoking film.,I watched this movie several times as a kid growing up and it's always stuck in my memory. Finally I located this movie and was able to get it and see it again. Still makes me wanna do some digging in egypt!
3,"good story,.but some complaints","On the whole, I found it to be a very enjoyable story, however, ( i think another reviewer mentioned this) there were many overdramatized moments. It seemed at the end of every chapter he had to end it with a powerful line ""He was Angelo Vestieri, a gangster"". After too many of these lines, they lose their effect, until they become almost cheesy.Also, WHERE WERE THE COPS???? In almost every ganster movie or book, the evasion and trouble with the law is a major part. In GANGSTER, all that is mentioned is ""the police sirens in the distance.""But don't let this discouraged you to read this book. You will still be impressed."
2,Not that good at all...,"Just read ""Godfather"" or ""The Last Don"". Or, for facts, Sammy Gravano's memoirs. ""Gangster"" just doesn't cut it. Carcaterra cannot mix action and quiet mob dignity skillfully enough to warrant his book a place next to Mario Puzo's ones. It's ironic, though, that when he wrote fiction which he tried to present as a ""true story"" (""Sleepers""), he wrote well, but now that he wrote fiction and labelled it as such, he couldn't make it as enjoyable."
4,Gangster - A solid book,"This is a solid book written in a powerful style. The content in the book shocks and surprises the reader who often doesn't expect things to happen the way they do. The book is divided into 2 sections. The main characters life in the first section and the narrator and the gangster's lives together in the second section. The words Lorenzo Carcaterra uses to depict his scenes are often powerful and convey a very clear image to the reader who can imagine the scene happening before his/her very own eyes. In my opinion, if you are a fan of gangster stories (or if you enjoyed 'The Godfather') you will find this an enjoyable read."
2,Maudlin and unrealistic.,"Credibility? The author acknowledges the assistance of more than a dozen people in the writing of the book...and not a single one of them explained to him that the end of the barrel of a gun is called the ""muzzle,"" NOT the ""nozzle."" Whenever someone looked down the ""nozzle"" of a handgun, I expected them to get extinguished with water.Sorry, folks, but something like this ruins the whole book. It's not a typo and it's not a minor error. It's evidence that the author doesn't really know what he's talking about and doesn't really care. All of the pontificating about the life of a ""gangster"" is basically crap.Of course, there are numerous other errors and problems with the book, but this is typical of the whole. The style is good...too bad about the rest."
4,REMINDS ME OF MY OLD NEIGHBORHOOD,"LOVED THIS BOOK AND AS A RESULT HAVE JUST ORDERED ALL MR. CARCATERRAS' BOOKS. GROWING UP IN BROOKLYN IN THE 50'S, IN AN ITALIAN NEIGHBORHOOD, PRIMED ME FOR ''GANSTERS''.....KNEW THESE PEOPLE. CANNOT PUT THIS UP THERE WITH ''THE GODFATHER'' BUT IT'S A CLOSE SECOND."
2,Somewhat sophomoric and shallow...,"As another reviewer mentioned, I also got off to at bad start when the author describes a raging World War I in the latter part of 1913. Naturally, that made me suspect to other facts in the story to follow. Certain events in the book were obviously ""made for TV"" events...the childbirth in the raging inferno, the ""here Dad, shoot yourself"" suicide of the Papa and the gunfight in the prostitute's bedroom were enough to make me roll my eyes and feel somewhat insulted. As a Puzo fan, and one who was looking forward to this read, I think when it comes out as USA Network's Mini-series of the Week, I'll flip the channel over to Emeril...."
5,Best Summer Read,"I am a voracious reader. I picked this one up to break the monotony of spies and hi-tech. It was more than I expected. Comparisions to the Godfather are misleading. The criminal life is not glorified or made to seem legitimate. This is a beautifully crafted novel that smoothly flows through one man's life as seen through the eyes of another. Despite the overuse of the term, it really was difficult to put down."
1,Is this a joke or what?,"Reviewer: Ben Storey tells it like it is. Please read his review before buying.The characters are preposterous. There behavior more so. Here we got two kids, one 7 y/o, one 10 y/o talking and behaving like old all knowing worldly gangster dons. At 12 and 15 they are n charge of running//hiring/firing/collecting$s from a certain dock and all it's workers. I couldn't take any more than 100 pages. What a piece of junk. L. Carcaterra obviously knows neither children, NY 1906, nor gangsters.I do recommend his book Sleepers tho. I thought that was pretty good.Gangsters should of never been published. It's a disgrace."
2,Too many holes,"This book was filled will all the typical gangster cliches. And they were poorly written, as well as poorly tied together. I expected more from this author as he wrote ""Sleepers"", which was a good book, but he missed the mark with this one."
1,Mob Dud,"This book was so vacuous and derivitive I couldn't finish the last 50 pages. What the author knows about the Mafia had to have come from watching movies. But we've all seen all the movies, so this book was just warmed over, imitative drivel.Operating on the ""greater fool"" theory, I quickly listed the book for sale and sold it ... I actually feel a little guilty I took money for it."
4,"Very fun read, although not exactly original","I enjoyed the hell out of this book. The pacing was great, the characters likeable, if not deep, and even though many times you could tell he was borrowing from other popular gangster books/movies, this still felt like a worthwhile read. The narrative form reminds me heavily of Goodfellas, and the root of the story reminds me a lot of Godfather. While it's not a direct rip off of either, you can tell each has a heavy influence. If you can put that aside and not let it bother you, you'll enjoy this book. My only complaint is that he sometimes doesn't smoothly transition between multiple narratives."
3,"Not great, not terrible, but average.",Not up to the Mario Puzo standard. The first part about the early years of the criminal organization were good. The latter stuff with the orphan boy in the 60's and 70's and 80's - very average.
3,"poorly written, but entertaining","I almost quit reading this book when the author described America in 1913 as being depressed by World War I. Luckily such errors were not common, but the writing still left something to be desired. I was not surprised to learn that Mr. Carcaterra is not a professional author; his dialogue in particular was unrealistic and over-dramatized.But in spite of my complaints about Carcaterra's style, he still spins a good yarn. When the reader overlooks a few holes (why does Ida the Goose befriend Angelo, what role does Angelo's second wife play, etc.) the novel is on the whole entertaining. I'm not disappointed in my purchase, and I don't regret my time investment, but this novel falls short of ""must-read"" status."
5,Road Trip,"I picked this audio book up in a small store somewhere in the south west part of Pennsylvania. I listened to it the whole way back to DC and absolutely loved it! But then I lost it, and did not get to finish...So here I am buying another copy just to hear the ending."
3,Good but no Sleepers,Beginning is fast paced from the birth of Angelo Vestieri to his entry into the criminal world of being a gangster. I really loved the Pudge character. I really didn't like the paragraphs whereby it seemed to be a lecture on what being a gangster entails. Story slows down from the 1960's to 1996. Some very brutal scenes. Still love Carcaterra's Sleepers the best.
5,GANGSTER DELIVERS THE GOODS!!,"This novel is the 3rd book I have read over the past decade by this author and this is by far the best!Gangster is so much more than what I thought it would be in terms of sheer storytelling and great characters from all walks of life. This is truly epic storytelling in both colorful characters as well as a kind of biography. Carcaterra takes us on a journey of breath-taking proportions that NO hollywood movie has even touched. Now I love movies like GODFATHER and GOODFELLAS and such, but let me tell you - this is by far superior in all aspects. I am really looking forward to his newest work coming."
4,Great Mafia/Ganster Book!...,This was the first book that I read from Mr. Carcaterra and I found it to be very good! Lookig forward to reading more of his work; maybe Sleepers is next. I think that with the success of HBO's The Sopranos; we all might be wanting a little bit more insight into the lives and patterns of organized crime and I must say that Carcaterra does a superb job of giving us a good look into that underground world and the mentality of these characters. Very good book!
2,Umbrella stand,I bought a Kettler chair and lounger chair and this umbrella stand. This does not seem to be as well made as the chairs. You fill this with sand or liquid then the hole closes with a flimsy piece of plastic that comes off easily. I would not buy this if I could do it over again.
5,Tennis & massage,Strength and flexibility are both important in tennis& doing massage. Thanks for your insight!This tape is user friendly and fun to do.
2,not happy....,I was really looking forward to getting this book....but I was so dissapointed when I got it. It's missing a ton of pages.....and it is filled with duplicate chapters.....It almost looks as if the pages were copied to make the book but they got them out of order. I really wish I could send this one back and get a new complete book...
5,Love Your Neighbor,"Pug Sheridan is a young girl in the south who deals with prejudice, ignorance and hatred of the very people she loves. Sandra Cline gives the reader a truthful picture of southern life in the early part of the century. She brings her characters to life and the reader grows to love them all, even the bad guys because we understand why they are as they are. On a larger scale it is a picture of how one person can change an entire community with love and acceptance. It's clear that Sandra Cline has a story to tell and it comes from her heart. This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. I wish it could be read by every high school student in America. Perhaps it could be used as a catalyst to change the way our young people view others. The paraphrased words that come to me are ""Treat others the way you'd like to be treated."""
1,Not just chick lit ---,"--- but New Age chick lit. Possibly the worst book I've ever read. Leaving out the clunky punctuation and bad grammar (several instances of ""laying"" instead of ""lying""), and other manifestations of bad editing, the whole plot is preposterous. Unbelievable characters do incredible things. All the minority characters, black and Cherokee, are dazzlingly wonderful. Two or three older women/witches perform miracles of benign magic. There are lapses in the interior logic and anachronisms. The only interesting things in the book had to do with the the cult of snake handling and the resurgence of the Klan. So as literature this was wretched, but as sociology it was, if accurate, perhaps worth your while."
5,Wonderful Book!,"I read this book on our car trip between Albuquerque, NM and Indianapolis, IN. I found it to be a well written, enthralling novel about a strong Irish girl's somewhat difficult teen-hood. I would recommend that the reader be older, at least mid teens, before reading this book, due to mature content.As I read the story, I felt very much like I was ""there"", almost a part of the ""7 sisters"". The ""twists"" near the end of the book were like sprinkles of colored candy on an already delicious ice cream cone.I also had the pleasure of meeting the author while in New Mexico. I found her to be very excited and proud of her book, as she should be!I was glad I bought it, and I think you will be, too!"
4,"Durable, and plenty of space for your gear","This is my second paddle holster of this style. The previous was identical, and lasted for 10 years of hard service with a Big City EMS. One day I sat down in a recliner at a fire station, and the holster caught the armrest. The leather ripped from around one of the back snaps. Well, this lasted for 10 years, and that's good enough for me, so it was off to the WWW to get another.This easily holds myGerber 46001 Take-A-Part 8-Inch Game Shear, two pairs of forceps, aMAGLITE M2A016 AA Mini Flashlight, Black, a throw-away pen, and my multi-tool.There is one reason that it earns 4 stars instead of 5. As with the previous holster, the snaps that form the belt loop don't hold very well at all. A little drop of Gorilla Glue fixed that this time, as did a similar fix years ago. I fully expect this one to last as long as the previous holster--I just hope my back can last as long!"
2,disappointing,I have been in EMS for almost 30 years. I was in need of a new holster and bought this one from Amazon. First problem the snaps for the belt loop wouldnt stay fastened. Then the stitching came a loose. Each time I took it to a local shoe repair shop in town and had it repaired. While transporting a patient the holster ripped completely in two at the belt loop. The leatherman at the Shoe repair says its made out of material that is not leather just a leather composite. I wouldn't buy it if I had known that. Good luck in your search.
4,very handy,"holds just about everything a field medic needs. i love it. great product. just one thing though, the buttons unsnap frequently but thats it. if your looking for a medic holster this is a great one. just needs a little modification. if there was no buttons to worry about it would have been a five star."
3,200# hoist,"Works Well.....However, This product is extremely labor intensive to install. I have a rooftop tent that I use this product for.This is definitely a 2 person installation and plan on spending the better part of a day. The reason is that you will need to supply the 2x6's to install and after you get back home with your 2x6's, you will then need to go back to Lowe's to get the 8 lag screws required for the installation. In addition the calibration for lowering and raising is intensive. My rafters didn't run the same direction that the instructions use. Also, You will need a laser to make the installation easier. In summary, plan on going up and down your ladder a minimum of 50 times.I would have probably bought the garage gator that is motorized from Costco that is the same price. Just my .02."
3,review,"Have not installed it yet, it does seem to be as advertised. I would like to see a heavier duty (300 pound) model."
3,Good but not great,Overall it's a good design. Works reasonably well ONCE you get the crazy sailboating knots figured out !In order to get it to go all the way to the ceiling you have to have all four attachment knots in the rope equal distance from the buckles. Sounds easy but it's not because you have to tie the knots in the exact spots so when you hoist it to the ceiling allfour knots are of equal distance. If not one or more of the knots will prevent it from going all the way up.One more thing I bought this one because the lighter duty one was not available. I only use this to lift my hard top off my 2012 Wrangler. the hard top does not weigh enough to bring the hoist down when released. I have to manually pull the hoist cables down by hand in order to get it to come down. If your using this for a Jeep Hardtop get the light duty one.
3,Not as easy to use as advertised,"Good product, but not as easy to lift as advertised.Pros - Price, QualityCons - need plenty of room of the cord length"
3,Grad level reading,College level reading material but great info. Most people purchase this book for a grad course but if you thank you can handle the book please read.
4,enlight,"This is a wonderful holiday gem. It is not often that performers like Channy and Tim get to be heard on record. Stand out tracks include ""reindeer on the roof"" and ""santa's slegweigh."" The songs are inspiring and christian like."
1,Bogus,"I purchased this CD a few months ago intending to play it during a christmas party. The party is in 5 days so tonight I decided to give it a listen. Imagine my surprise when there was NOTHING the least bit enjoyable about this product. If you are expecting christmas music with the Phil Spector famous wall of sound, this is not the cd you are looking for. The title and graphics are the same but the music has absoutly no resembelance."
1,Garbage.,"First of all, this album has absolutely nothing to do with Phil Spector or the classic Christmas album, ""A Christmas Gift for You."" It's just a collection of bad songs with a faux Phil Spector cover slapped on it. Very misleading. Don't waste your money."
5,Beautiful Pictures and Verse,"I have been reading this book to my 3-month-old. He loves the rhythm and sound of the unique words. He also loves all the color and outlines in the batik pictures. I really enjoy it, too. I have a feeling this will be a favorite for years!"
1,Quite boring.,This book is neither interesting for my kids or for me. I thought it would make counting fun. But it doesn't. This book is quite dull.
5,Good seat,"I didn't buy this seat to put in a car. I have a racing rig setup for my Grand Turismo 5 racing game for my Playstatuion 3. For a year i had used one of those cheap game chairs that you usually find at Walmart/K-Mart and those cheap things are made as such and not comfortable to sit in for long periods of time. I figured the best way to go is to buy a actual racing seat that's meant for a car, so I started searching around the internet and found this seat here on Amazon. The chair itself is good quality, comes with the slider mechanism and reclines. Pretty much all I needed. Chair is comfortable, has a little bit of lumbar support, overall nice chair. I would recommend to others. I ordered this seat with the free super saver shipping option from Amazon and still received it within 7 days, under a week, so I was happy. I'm a satisfied customer."
4,"Bottom line: Comfortable, but not feminine.","I brought this shoe in Black/Silver. The leather is nice and the shoe is well constructed, but when I wear them, they look a men's shoe. My guess is that the manly look of the shoe stems for the foot form the designer used. On the plus side, they are very comfortable and loose fitting. I think Perlina is best off continuing to make fantastic handbags"
3,Fast Shipping,"The cable arrived very quickly. This is for my backup stock so I have not tried it yet. For the price, doesn't matter much...I'm sure it will be ok."
5,new grill finally,"Our old Genesis spirit (18 years old) finally gave way to the new stainless steel grill. This grill works quicker, grills more evenly and is a joy to use."
5,A TRUE lyricist! Variety has FINALLY arrived!!!!!,"If you are not up on Dirty Birdy, shame on you! Dirty is a hidden jewel in hip-hop and the world will soon see what all of the hype is about surrounding this cat. This record has sooo much style, the lyrics are off the chain and the beats are crazy phat!! You won't go wrong adding this to your collection. I'm sure that this will stay in your disc changer for a while."
3,Tweet - Cab Ride not a great choice,I Like This Song But I Wish It Wasn't Released As A Single. I Have All The Tweet Merchandise and I Love what she does but I Feel she mad a Bad Move This Time With Cab Ride It is A Good Song But Not Single Material.Track Listing:1.Cab Ride (Album Version) -5/52.Cab Ride (Radio Edit)-5/5 all it does it cut out the little intro part and one chorus3.Cab Ride (Hook) - 0/5 - Why Put This On Here???? Its Only The Chorus Thats All!!!
1,LIARS!!,"The picture shows the textbook, but these bloody liars actually sent the instructor' edition!! DON'T BUY from THEM if you value your money! they cheat students!"
3,Mixed Bag,"Some of the case studies were great, like an investigative magazine article, and some were impenetrable and laden with jargon, like the worst academic writing. Also, some of the ""made up"" case studies were fun, and the questions useful for thinking about."
3,Not what I expected,"Large Book with many case studies however, if you are wanting to learn how issues were resolved you have to order another book from publisher. I went to the other site and found that you had to be a professor at a university to order this other book. This was not as helpful as I was hoping. I was trying to increase my knowledge on problem resolution. Not what I was expecting."
3,a book full of case studies,"I have bought it for PMP preparation. not helped really on this matter, but it was a good food for thoughts about various project implementation cases."
4,Short-and-Sweet,"Some of the case studies in this book are very long and extremely detailed (in a good way!), but some are short-and-sweet. Kerzner gets to the point quickly and really makes you think. I used this book in a Project Management master's program and referred to it in several classes. Make sure you check your syllabus and get the correct edition, though. Some of us bought our books before a syllabus change and had to scramble to find page numbers that corresponded with the new edition."
4,Study project management,I am studying project management and need examples of case study that was written by professionals to me in my studies
2,Not what I expected,"This is ok, but not what I was expecting. I thought I was going to be getting the whole Bible with notes to read in a year. What it is is just passages to read every day with a quick overview of each book. Not what I wanted."
2,Good if you know how to play guitar,"i got this assuming it would teach you the basics of playing rock guitar since in the review it said for people who have never held a guitar. the guy in the lessons is saying to play all these notes, if youve never held a guitar, how are you supposed to know whan an e minor is? the only good thing in the is when you go to learn songs, you can slow the tempo down so it is easier to play. and you can start someone who doesnt know how to play guitar off by having them play crossroads."
2,not great,doesn't stay on the screen...went on ok but lifts at the edges continually...just leaving it till I find something better
1,buy something better,"Buy something, but buy something better.Black ipod videos will scuff up very quickly, both the screen and the rest of the front (which this doesn't protect).Really cheap cost, and really cheap quality.Good luck getting out the bubbles out."
1,Very shaky pictures,I bought this camera after a lot of research but was disappointed by the performance. Most of the pictues were shaky.I've never had this problem with my regular film camera ever.
4,we love this camera!,"We are constantly amazed at the image quality. It is especially good at macro imaging...it does a little less well in low light...would suggest using tripod for low-light situations.The size is perfect. When the power is off, it is just a small steel box that fits perfectly in my pocket. There are no worries about scratching the lens or a knob breaking off. GREAT DESIGN!The pics that we have printed onto paper are truly picture perfect. I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a camera that trvels well and has unlimited possibilities!Our favorite features:BLACK AND WHITE!Multiple exposure!Macro...extreme close ups show amazing detail!Smart Media (we have three 64 MB cards and can take about 300 photos without downloading to the computer.)PRICE!"
4,ROCK & ROLL IS HERE TO STAY WITH STATUS QUO,"I bought this Album when it was released, I couldn't believe the music being played by this group. I continued to buy their albums & just recently bought the new CD-In Search of The Fourth Chord, & the new concert DVD. The DVD is not available for the USA region. It's two bad this group never made it real big in the states they could easily have been the greatest Rock group in the whole world. They are the greatest Rock group in the world but most of the USA still doesn't know it. Buy this cd, turn it up and Rock & Roll."
5,possumsmcbikeritems,Apart from 'Piledriver' this is my favourite Quo CD.Unavailable in a lot of countries and I don't know why.
3,Senior Lit Victim,"I only read it because they made me. If you're in the same situation, don't worry, it's not all that bad. Wade through the first chapter or two and it'll pick up."
2,Interesting idea but flat characters.,The book started out with a very interesting idea as a child sliped through a time gate.I was really sorry to see that we never really understood the attraction between the main characters unless one considers sex a reason to love someone.The characters never had anything in commen and I was never convinced that they even had a reason tolike each other.The plot was vague and I spent much time wondering why she was always so misserable.I know that the entire story could have been better plotted and with more character depths and we all would have been rivitted.Better luck next time.
5,old fave,read this back in the late 90's and fell in love with the author and have followed her work ever since. This book is my favorite!
4,Can this woman write!,"I have read two time-travel stories, PIRATES and KNIGHTS, both written by Linda Lael Miller. What an imagination the woman has! Fascinating stuff, fantasy with a fair amount of historic detail. I liked PIRATES slightly more than KNIGHTS, probably only because it was a somewhat less complex story, and within the complicated fantasy framework the reader needs to accept, it seemed to flow more easily. Still, I think that both of these novels are masterpieces within their genre, and I recommend them both heartily. Can this woman write!"
4,"Wonderful, Enchanting Story!","Knights from author Linda Lael Miller was one of the best audiobooks I have listened to. I felt so sorry for poor little Megan the sweet little girl who was abandonded by her selfish, uncaring parents, but then Megan stepped through the magical gate and was transported to medieval England and finally found a loving and caring family and they changed her name to Gloriana and she was wed to Dane and even though he didn't have feelings for her at first you know it wouldn't be long before he fell for the beautiful, sweet Gloriana. There were some things in the audio book I personaly found to be too explicit but I still liked the rest of it."
5,A most enjoyable timetravel romance.,"This exciting tale of a childs rescue, her later romance and separation from her husband Dane St. Gregory was intriguing to say the least. The unwilling time-travel of Gloriana and the lovers apart keeps one in suspense throughout the book. You won't want to put it down until the end"
3,OK - Not great.,"Didn't start like a time travel at all & some things struck me as not essential to the story. I couldn't grasp the characters, Dane wasn't likealble at first - even in a good 'bad' way. Gloriana was introduced as a tomboy which was not even a part of her character throughout the rest of the book. Took awhile to get to know the couple. It finally got interesting and I managed to finish it."
5,Great Book,This is a great book. This book is very intense; and even made me cry at certain chapters. If your a fan of Texas history like me; this is the book for you.Crystal
2,Great characters no surprises,Good writing and characterization but not much on plot and definitely no action. Don't be fooled by the interesting looking cover. The surprises didn't surprise. It's like a 1st contact story that condenses the contact to 10 pages after 300 pages of setup and then ends abruptly with nothing happening in between.
5,"compelling, well written page turner!","I don't believe I've read a more compelling book! It was purchased from a bargain table as something to read while recovering from a foot injury. The therapy for my soul and mind was worth far far more than the few dollars I paid.So many times I've been disappointed in the quality of ""Christian Fiction."" Not so with ""SOUTH PACIFIC JOURNAL."" The characters are believable and very interesting. Descriptive passages place the reader on location in the South Pacific. I've never read such compelling ""flash-back"" passages. Even though the narrative left many unanswered questions about the characters (What happened to the lieutenant? How did Sarah try to contact her family? When and how did she return to Manila?) I feel as if I really know the characters personally. I hope David & Nancy French write a sequel.My gratitude goes to the authors for such excellent writing and to the publisher for printing this book."
5,Great cap for the money,"This cap goes great with the pink womens ReD sox shirts. And, is nicely priced in comparison to those sold by the MLB"
1,unsatisfied customer,"The description on the product was for the Grinch costume, however a ""jailbate"" costume was sent, I was not a satisfied customer at all"
4,Que rico,"This was probably one of the first Latino/a Erotica anthologies that I ever read and it was hot. It is well-written and includes some well-known authors. This is must read for anyone interested in good erotica and interested in the area studies of Latino Literature, Chicana/o Studies, Latin American writers and the like."
5,A true hi-fi bargain,I was surprised to see speakers of this level of quality on Amazon.com; B&W speakers are generally reserved for hi-fi specialty boutiques (although B&W's more expensive lines have not made it to this site). Forget the mass-market brands out there--none of them are in the same league as the B&W DM600 series.
3,"It looks nice, but you get what you pay for","This product looks great on my stainless steel kitchen sink, however, it rusted within only a couple months of use. I continued to clean off the rust and use the dispenser for about six months before the part that the top screws onto broke off completely. So, for the price, I guess six months of use isn't too bad..."
3,Nice but....,Had this blender for about a year now. It works well (use it every morning for breakfast shake) especially with blending ice. The problem is parts: Yesterday two of the four blades fell off (luckily I noticed and fished them out) and I've had no luck on the internet finding replacements.
2,BCF 1350,I really liked this blender but dropped my jar and broke it. I just wasted 2 hours of my day off looking all over the internet for a replacement. NO luck. They do not have a replacement part. I will replace this with a product that at least offers replacement parts. DONT BUY FROM BETTY CROCKER.
1,THIS COMPANY IS A RIP OFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Do not buy this product. What they send you is not the one shown. The nutrium soap was discontinued 2 yrs ago. That's what I thought they were charging me for, but when I got it, it was a different type that costs $3.35 for 2 bars!!!!!!!!!!! then they did not refund the money even though they did not send what was pictured. DO NOT buy from these people............"
5,This is a TREASURE!!,My sister and I both put our children to sleep with these enchanting lullabyes for years! I even purchased the digital for my kindle. My husband still loves to hear the songs and slips into a restful sleep if he is laying down while it's playing. Pamala's voice and the music are both so beautiful..
2,Not very good,"This CD isn't that good. There are much better ones. We like &quot;Crib Notes&quot;($9) and &quot;Lullabies&quot;($4). So does our 2 year old daughter and 8 month old son. Please consider other CDs like the 2 we mentioned before. They're available from Target, too."
1,Poor quality...I gave it away,"I am a mosaic artist and like to keep a variety of materials handy. The glass quality was so poor I thought it was some kind of plastic. It appeared to be random glass objects that were smashed and tumbled. It was disappointing because Amazon is my ""go to"" place(I have your Amazon rewards credit card). I was forced to shop at EBay to get a decent selection of choices.I chose the one star rating because you didn't offer a zero option ."
2,Very Short CD !!!!!,"This Cd contains some nice performances from all the players involved but Beware as it is Only 25 Minutes Long!!!! Before parting with your hard earned cash, take this into consideration. The solos are nice but short and the players don't really stretch out. You have been warned... Paul"
1,"On Christmas Day, In The Evening","...I have a large collection of Free Kindle Books, and this is THE ONLY BOOK, in the whole collection, THAT WILL ""NOT"" LET ME OPEN IT, either on my PC or my Ipad2. When I do try to open the book, it automatically kicks me off of Kindle, with no recourse. I have no problems at all with the other book in this collection, called ""On Christmas Day, In The Morning"". Wondering if anyone else has had a problem with this book ??? I have to give ONE STAR due to the GLITCH in this book."
5,New life for my phone,"New life for my phone. This costs a lot less than a new phone and I'm not stuck in another contract. Battery arrived almost a week before I expected it. Put it in my phone, charged it up, and now I get a couple hours talk time instead of a couple minutes. It is slightly larger than original but not all that noticeable."
4,good 4 the price,"fits, works, and last a couple days on a single charge...so far (i've been using it for about a month)"
5,Problem fixed for a few bucks,"""Worked as promised. Slightly different then stock battery but not enough to matter on a 2+ year old phone. I'm just happy to have normal battery operation back. Can't believe I suffered for months rather than drop a few bucks like this to fix it all. """
4,Helped keep my LG Fusic alive !,"The battery that came with my LG fusic lasted a year and a half and since I had another 6 months for the contract renewal, I ordered this battery which has helped keep my phone alive for the last 4 months. It fits properly but not as thin as the original battery."
5,Phone battery works great!,"The sprint store told me to get a new phone, because the battery was going to cost way to much. Found this battery on line for less then 1/10 the cost and decided to give it a try. Works great! no problem with the latch (thought it might be a problem to match but it was the same). A great value."
5,I've read it Four Times in the Last Year,"I love this book. The pacing, the characters, the description--everything about it is tight and enthralling. I was in tears from the first page wishing that I could write as well.The thing that truly sets LUCK IN THE SHADOWS apart are the well-rounded character portrayals. No one is static here. Everyone grows and changes.The action flows beautifully and logically from start to finish, and leaves you wanting more. Luckily, I had STALKING DARKNESS on hand so that I could go right into the next book.I highly recommend it--and have done so more times than I can count!"
4,Fun fantasy,"Luck in the Shadows is one of those books you like to remember. No one will ever write on the cover ""Comparable to Tolkien at his best!"" (a sure signal that the book is overblown): this is a fantasy world where magic has laws, elves fall in love, and even those on a noble quest get blisters. Nice romance between the two heroes, as well, and it gets better in the sequel! Buy this for your kid sister (or brother) as their first introduction to fantasy, and they'll never look back."
4,Pretty good,"When I started reading this book I thought it was going to be another epic story but it turned out to be pretty good. I like the way that Flewelling draws her world and the history behind it. Some of the characters such as Nysander and Alec are a bit predictable but I have hopes that the characters will develop through the trilogy.Flewelling keeps dropping hits about Seregil's past and we just want to learn more about it, doesn't always work for me, but it did this time.All in all a good and fun read."
2,wish i read the reviews more carefully,"This is actually a good book, but i didn't know it was gay fantasy until half way through. I thought it was weird how the older thief kept thinking the young boy he rescued was cute, so I came back to amazon and re-read the reviews more carefully, and saw the descriptions."
3,Worth it despite some problems with the writing.,"I struggled a bit with this book. I had been reading better authors and the prose in this is pretty flawed. I did finally get involved with the characters and now, by the middle of the second book, am invested enough to find those issues minor distractions. The plot, characters, and relationships are worth it and I look forward to the rest of the books. I recommend sticking to it. The writing does improve and the world grows on you."
5,"Great read, great characters","Let me say this from the start, if you love Robin Hobbs, you will love this book and author. This book is drawn well from a character standpoint and not so much plot driven. Alec is the central character followed closely by Seregil who is my favorite character to come along in a long time. The plot is nothing too outlandish, but the plot is secondary and the relationship and growth of the characters is what draws you in. Yes, if you have read the reviews there is a hint of a gay relationship, but if that is something that concerns you I would say throw those concerns aside. It is a very minor part of the story and it is handled well."
3,Ho-hum,"I would have preferred to give ""Luck in the Shadows"" two and a half stars. It's competently written, but I just didn't find it very interesting. The storyline was very typical of fantasy novels (with strong shades of a certain other author for a large part of the book), and was definitely the first part of a series, rather than being self-contained. The unanswered questions about the artefact that affected Seregil, those hunting it, and the apparent coming war were very annoying. Is the storyline that suddenly developed of plots against the Queen picked up in the subsequent novels? If not, it comes across as filler. A tighter structure, a less typical storyline, and a greater concentration on what skills a good thief and spy needs to have would have improved ""Luck in the Shadows"" significantly."
4,Lucky choice,"I was telling myself that I wasn't going to buy another fantasy book set an a quasi-medival setting again, especially after being mildly disapointed after David Eddings latest effort. However, I did buy this and was very plesently suprised. The plot is engaging and easy to follow, there are not too many characters and these do not have ridiculous names (Robert Jordan, take note) and there are only a small number of jokes (David Eddings take note).Admittedly, it is a bit by-the-numbers but it is very well written and well thought out which makes it very good reading."
4,Very entertaining,"I found this to be a very entertaining read. The characters are believable (as much so as any character in a sword-and-sorcery novel can be), and I found Alec's progress from hayseed to apprentice thief well done. The settings are well-visualized. Internal consistency (a must for a good fantasy novel) is maintained. On the whole, a worthwhile first novel. I look forward to the rest of the series."
4,Damn fine start,"Nice start to the series. I would have liked to see the author flesh out the background of the characters a little more, but maybe that's for another day.If you can get around the homosexuality implications, you have a great story, and a different but very well done take on the ""orphan boy"" deal."
4,Stunned,"My friend recommended this set of books to me, as I am a fantasy aficionado. The world that Lynn Flewelling creates is rich, varied and intricate in its detail. While a little slow in the beginning, Luck in the Shadows quickly brings characters that almost everyone can relate to in some way and which makes them enjoyable. I recommend reading these three books in order and together, so that the impact and suspense is not lost on the reader. Definitely one of my favorite books that I've read in the past year or two. Sarcasm and love, terror, hatred and confusion all combine in a realistic and very enjoyable read."
4,Not a bad way to spend your evenings,"Flewelling puts the right ingredients into the first book of the Nightrunner series. There is intrigue, suspicion, and determination in this novel. She also adds some bold sexual roles to her characters, something rare in the fantasy genre. Overall it is not like the complex world of Jordan, nor does it have the character depth of Eddings. It is nevertheless a compelling book worthy of your attention."
5,A refreshing debut novel.,"The book starts off with a bang and doesn't lose any steam until the end. The two heroes, along with their many companions, are really well done and are a refreshing change from the heroes that seem to pervade the industry at this time. It is a rollicking fantasy and I eagerly await her next book"
4,Best ever? Hmmmm...Don't think so,"You can tell it's a first book. The story is engaging, the characters more than 2 dimensional, and the world itself is intriguing. However, the show-don't-tell approach at times and the heavy handed 'lets have two characters suddenly discuss what is going on in the world and no-one will know it's a plot device' wears thin. The amount of whispered conversations they party hear is astounding. Surely there are better ways to incorporate and expose information than blatant slotting it in and hoping nobody notices. And if you aren't being telegraphed most of the plot and seeing through the obvious detours, then you don't read enough fantasy. Yes, it was enjoyable, but it could have been much better. As I said, first book. I'm encouraged enough to read the second, though."
3,Interesting beginning.,"It seems like people tend to either really love or hate this book. Not me-- I found myself coming down firmly in the middle.I liked the take on the orphaned prodigy. I liked the characters and the adventure. I found the plot a little bit less and the political landscape felt a bit abbreviated, if not actually derivative. Perhaps the worst thing of all, the book slipped very quickly from my mind. I had to actually work to recall what it was that I had read.I'm curious to see what's going to happen in the next book in the series, and I may rethink my judgement after that. We'll see."
2,One word...Boring,"I tried and wanted to like this book, but it was a chore to finish it. I did finish it eventually. But it was soooo slow and boring. It never went anywhere! I mean, sure it's a series, but doesn't SOMETHING have to happen in the first book?? I didn't care about the characters, I thought they were flat and uninteresting. I mean, there isn't even much to say about this book. It is forgettable....boring."
2,I lost interest in the second book,"I enjoyed the first book very much, however, the second book duplicated the first and I began to lose interest."
3,Too many errors,"I used the 1997-1998 version of this book. Although it seemed to me to be one of the better review books around, the many errors in the review problems were a large source of frustration and loss of precious study time for me. The problems were all in SI units (a plus since you can now do the FE in SI units), but it seems that the author and his helpers were somewhat careless when converting the old problems into SI units. Hopefully, these have been corrected for the 1998-1999 version. The review material was good for the most part, but I felt it could be expanded in some sections. If you have been away from school for a while you might want to find a more thorough reference."
3,"a problem oriented review of the topics, not a general review.","This book is geared toward those students who have recently completed their education. The premise is that working lots of problems, you gain an understanding of the subject. This is not really the case for those with inadequate preparation and who need a thorough review of each topic. For this type of student then a more thorough review book is needed such as Engineer-In-Training License Review, or EIT Civil Review, two popular books that fully cover the topics, with step-by-step examples and solutions, a review of each topic, followed by a sample exam."
2,Late posting,the quality of the book and its price is good but they posted it too late!they have a bad time management.
1,BUYERS BE AWARE !!!!!,"BUYERS BE AWARE !!! MERCHANDISE IS NOT AS DESCRIBED ....DECIVEOUS SELLER....

1,Pens were too small for our DS lite. they fall out!,The pens do not stay in the DS stylus holder on the side of the DS. They are too small and fall out.Do not purchase!
2,Not sent what was advertised,"Order was received quick, however I ordered the stylus pen for my son in three colors, black, grey and metallic and instead received 3 pink ones. If they dont fix will never buy another product from them again."
3,In Position,"The book had some good points and example although I did not agree with everything stated but I was able to meet it half way.It is good for those who may be first entering into the spiritual world of Christ and to get some additional understanding of the Bibles instructions along with the teachings of your faith on being a church going woman. But the man better get in position too! I'll give the author a B average, it was good information. I read both of her books and I am listening!"
4,Good for a Laugh. Audiobook.,"You can read the plot in other reviews.This is a suspense novel that will make you laugh out loud.My favorite genre and hard to find.There is a lot of foul language that isn't necessary to make it as good as it is.If you can get past that I would recommend it.The books are funny, but unfortunately seems to get raunchier as the series goes on."
5,A BREATH OF FRESH AIR.....,"This is my first Hap & Leonard novel. I happened to pick up the audio book version from my local library. I've been listening to the book commuting to work and let me tell you this is a hoot! A bunch of funny characters and even funnier situations and lines, and very well-written. I'm only about 1/4 of the way through but I am already hooked. This has made my commuting a joy ride everyday. I often found myself laughing out loud. If your recent reading experience is somewhat stale and if you want to experience the joy of reading again, pick up this book."
5,Perfect entertainment!,"I love Joe R. Lansdale; I think he is the best writer ever to put words on paper. He should be knighted or something. The Hap and Leonard series is pure joy from start to finish. I love both of them, their beautiful friendship, their humor and the outrageous situations they manage to get themselves into. As always, this novel has incredibly well-written prose, hilarious lines and situations and wonderful suspense and action. You really care about the good guys--I always want to hug them!--and yell yee-haw when the bad guys get their asses kicked. The best thing about these books, is that there is also a serious, sometimes wistful tone underneath it all. Sometimes you cry a little. Sometimes you want to hide from the evil of the bad guys. But mostly you just laugh! Perfect!"
4,"A sense of humor, and no boundaries","In the end it was a police procedural, but this thing will have you laughing your butts off. I hope he does more with these characters, but even if he doesn't - the story was a fun read."
2,Really Bad Chili,"Bad CHili is a bad book. It's like the author got his opinion of the South from watching Easy Rider. Also the characters were completely unbelieveble. That being said, I read the whole thing."
5,"If you love life, you gotta' read this book","Lansdale does more in one sentence than most could do in three chapters. It pure mmojo, as only Lansdale can do. Fast, hard and speaks the way we all do in real life. And that's just the title characters. Hap Collins and Leonard Pine. In trouble again and deep in suspense mystery for our amusement and edge of your seat story telling. Buy this book. If you don't like, there is something wrong with you."
3,The usual claptrap from DeCoteau,"I've never been a big fan of David DeCoteau's work, and his new movie ANCIENT EVIL: SCREAM OF THE MUMMY will not change that, for better or worse. It is an extremely average ""teens in peril, monster roams spooky house"" tale. The acting is decent, but nothing spectacular.Most laughable of all is the monster itself. First off, it's fitted with what looks like one of the masks DeCoteau used in PRISON OF THE DEAD. Secondly, I can't quite say I've ever seen such a...healthy...mummy. This creature looks like it puts away a couple of six packs a day!Anyway, to make a long story short, it's no GONE WITH THE WIND, but it's not as bad as DeCoteau's other recent bombs (VOODOO ACADEMY, anyone?)"
