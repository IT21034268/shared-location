2,Stupid,I though this book is very badley put togather. Some parts make no sense to many characters and I will never buy another one of these books again. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!!!
1,Unpublishable except by an author of Cornwell's stature.,"This is an exceptionally weak effort by Cornwell, with no characterization, a silly plot and no meaning. It reads like a first draft. After two books, we still know nothing about Hammer, West or Brazil -- and I don't care enough to want to find out in a third book. I doubt that any publisher would go near this if not for Cornwell's Scarpetta book sales."
2,"Second chance given, disappointed again.","Cornwell's normal tight, descriptive narrative again breaks down in her attempt to address a need to break the mold, try something new, or whatever this book and Hornet's Nest are about. No doubt that the talent is there--just too much of a departure from Scarpetta for this reader. Where are these characters going?? I can't seem to muster the necessary empathy to CARE what happens to them so it's hard to wade through the muck and mess of Richmond and the South to complete this journey."
1,Nil Points,"I have read and enjoyed many of Cornwells novels (including Hornets Nest) but this was utter utter rubbish. It is unfunny in the extreme. Any atempt at humour is obviously just that - an attempt. It just doesn't work - the plot is weak, unbelievable and completely uninteresting, the pet's opinions are nothing more than plain stupid. West and Brazil's relationship appeared to be run on the level of 10 year olds rather than with the maturity I would presume they should have. Subjects are only touched on, nothing is really finished or tied up (for example Hammer's unresolved grief) PLEASE save your cash. This just isn't worth the actual effort of trying to plough it. Not one star at all - minus ten."
4,A dark and funny Cornwell,"Cornwell's books have generally been good reads, but she has tended to ignore the possibilities of humor. No more! _Southern Cross_ is a wickedly funny look at the underside of Richmond, Virginia and by extension of the urban South. At times evoking memories of _A Confederacy of Dunces_, the book skewers the self-satisfied pomposity of the Southern establishment with a deftness that only a local could manage. As a longtime Richmonder, I found myself constantly smiling and occasionally breaking into a guffaw. Non-Richmonders should enjoy it almost as much as those who recognize the people behind the fiction."
2,Not a complete waste of time,"I love all of Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta books, they are fast-paced and intriguing. The style of this book is the opposite, a lot of jerking back and forth between subplots that sort of come together in the end. I took this book on a trip and was going to give it to my mom when I was done reading it, but I wasn't sure if she'd like it or even if I liked it. I also couldn't really say what it was about, but it suggests things like racism, police brutality, high school violence, without ever coming to a real point. I like the characters Hammer, West, and Brazil, but I felt like any development of them was confusing and conflicted a bit with my impressions of them from Hornet's Nest. I think PC's strong points as a writer are her ability to make you want to turn the page and finish the book in one sitting, but this book made me want to put it down and walk out of the room."
1,The Worst Cornwell Novel Yet!!,This book is the absolute worst Cornwell novel that she has written. This is pure trash with no redeeming plot or character development. I hope that Patricia Cornwell will go back to her Kate Scarpetta novels and get off of this kick of late with Southern Cross and Hornet's Nest.
1,Her worst effort,"I believe that Patricia needs to stop the story line with Hammer, West, and Brazil. I read Hornet's Nest and thought it was okay, so I gave this one a chance and I wished I had not. The use of Niles again and then adding Popeye the dog was so far fetched that I wanted to ask Mrs. Cornwell what was she was thinking. The Kay Scarpetta series is Patricia's best efforts. DO NOT waste your time on this story."
1,Very disappointing!,"My husband and I are big fans of Patricia Cornwell. We have read all the Scarpetta series and absoltely love them. This book was a total disappointment. After my husband read it, he told me it wasn't any good, but I read it anyway. I kept waiting for a real plot and for it to get better. It was a total disappointment and a waste of good money! I will not buy another one in this series! Is this really the same writer that wrote all the Scarpetta books?!"
1,B O R I N G,Would have liked to given a rating of 0 stars!Reading this book was a complete waste of time.
1,Every cliche possible in one book. Awful ! Whither Cornwel?,"I will not put a book down unread and that is the only reason I have read this book to completion. Miss Cornwell utilizes every possible anti-Southern, anti-tobacco, anti-Richmond, etc, etc It will be a longtime, if ever, before I line Miss Cornwell's pockets with another purchase. I have read every word she has published but this is the end. Mike Yorke"
1,Her worst book ever.,"I love Ms. Cornwall's Kay Scarpetta and although Hornet's Nest wasn'a favorite of mine, I was willing to give this new one the benefit of the doubt. It's really awful. The characters are all unsympathetic and unlikable, even the one's we're supposed to like and I finally put it down halfway through. It was a waste of money. I'll wait for the next Scarpetta book but not read this series again."
1,"Vulgar, common characters result in dismal book.","Cornwell's former books were entertaining, witty and unoffensive. This book, about predejudice, bizarre, brutal characters and a beleaguered southern city is nothing new, though it borders on boring vulgarity. I am very disappointed in this book and regret even more that I purchased it."
1,Better luck next time!,"Sorry but this book wasn't even close to Ms. Cornwell's previous worse, (I have never read a bad one until this one) so what's up? I live in Harrisonburg, VA and can't believe that everyone in Richmond is that stupid, doesn't anyone there have an average IQ? And also (I know I am alone here) why is there so much profanity in this book, it was repulsive. I grew up around the US Navy in Norfolk, VA for 35 years and never heard this language all day and all night long . . . give it a rest. Of course if the people in Richmond are as ignorant as they are portrayed then their vocabulary is probably like this. And one good note the language mangler was good, she done good working on her, in my opinion the only bright spot, but still not worth reading. Better luck next time!"
2,A time wasting excercise!,This is my first (and last ) Patricia Cornwell read. A trio of policemen and women try to clean up a Southern town populated by psycopaths and rednecks.The characters are completely overdrawn to the point of caricatures.It could possibly be turned into an amusing B-grade movie at best!
3,A delight,"Some people just don't have a sense of humor, Patricia. There were times when I was laughing out loud. You took a pot shot at everybody and hit the mark every time. You even played games with stereotypes (the driver who did not know his way around but could speak English; the prominent citizen who couldn't.) The most important lesson to be learned from this book is that there are too many people out there hearing things that haven't been said and others who do not pay attention at all. I agree with a review that said the narrative got lost at times but I was amazed at how this incredible cast of characters tied together in the end. Sometimes I saw it coming and sometimes I didn't. For people who may be getting a little tired of serial killers, this is a delightful change of pace."
2,Forget the Comparisons to Cornwell's Previous Books,"This novel is just plain weak. Patricia Cornwell's editor should have been braver! I did manage to get through this novel, so it rates two stars instead of one. However, so much of the novel feels inauthentic, with poorly attempted humor. Teenagers come across as having the intellectual and emotional capacity of five-year-olds. A woman with English as her second language jumbles words and mixes metaphors so horribly that maybe, at first, it might be mildly humorous. But the joke goes on way too long. Paragraph after paragraph after paragraph of this minor character's mangled speech becomes excruciating to read. Lastly, getting into the point of view of household pets nearly works but feels utterly out of context."
2,Murder on the Rise,"Cornwell weaves her story of corruption that escalates to murder. Hammer is brought in to clean up the police department. Hammer finds that they do not like her stirring-up trouble. All of this is played out in front of the public. There are to many sub characters that take away from the story. By Ruth Thompson author of ""Natchez Above the River"""
2,Its OK,"Judy hammer, police chief, tries to clean up Richmond, Va., and reorganize the computer system. I like these people but it took me a while to like the book. Murder, compassion, romance, even pets. Some really evil people brings out the rage in the reader. The book comes together very good in the end"
2,Not her best.,"As with the other reviews listed here, I have to agree that this is not Cornwell's best. I enjoy most of her Kay Scarpetta books much more. There was some humor in the book, and Weed's character was amusing and believeable. If you have other books you want to read, put them on top of this one."
2,Can't Have a Winner Every Time -- This is an Example,"I usually enjoy Patricia Cornwell's books because they are intelligent, complex and well-researched. Unfortunately, this book seems to play to an audience who's looking for something a little different. The character names alone are cartoon-ish, at best, and take away from the plot and action. In addition, the quirks so elaborately described have no bearing on the plot or even help explain the characters actions.The crimes and blunders are spelled out up front so there is no mystery as to who-done-it. This format would be ok if something happened to really mix things up and create an intricate plot. Cornwell's way of mixing things up was a very weak link (a garbled phone call).Not a bad book if you don't want to think at all. I, however, am looking for more of her old stuff to keep me interested and playing detective.Better luck next time, Patricia !"
3,"Compared to others, I enjoyed this book.","This book was very ingrossing and enjoyable. I enjoyed the charachters, and the story flowed well and was captivating. Even though it was not as spell binding as some of her other books, it was a good read and well worth the buy."
4,"Cornwell conducts a twentieth century ""siege of Richmond""","Much better than ""Hornet's Nest"", but totally different genre than the Scarpetta series, which I like better. Her satire is very, very rich, with frankly better characterizations than the Scarpetta series, especially of Bubba Fluck and the Police dispatcher. However, I was overwhelmed because I was trying to understand how the three main protagonists could ever function in the total insanity she projects as Richmond, VA. She must have a strong dislike of Richmond..I guess this means that Scarpetta will never go back there, but continue to work out of DC, or where ever."
1,A MAJOR Disappoinment,"I could not believe that Patricia Cornwell could write a book this badly. A novice writer would not have a chance to have such a work published (and justifiably so). There was not one redeeming quality to this novel. Even Niles-the STAR, as far as I was concerned of Hornet's Nest-was relegated to a cartoon role. I am not sure if there could have been any more loose ends at the end. I hope that PC is not becoming bored with her work, or worse, taking her fans for granted. I'd rather she'd subscribe to the ""absence makes the heart grow fonder"" theory of pumping out books rather than ""familiarity breeds contempt."" I will be wary of her next non-Kay book; on the other hand, if there is one, it has got to be better than this one."
1,I could not even finish it,"This was so bad, neither my husband nor I could finish this. A character named Butt Fluck - c'mon. I liked Cornwall's other books, each one a little less, but this is going to be the last one I buy."
1,IT SUCKED,Definitely not worth reading. What was she thinking? It is the worst trash out there!!! She should be totally and utterly embarrassed by this piece of crap! I would find more excitement reading the yellow pages. Never again will i read a non-Scarpetta!!!
1,Dull,"How about no stars? Not sure which is worse, this one or Faye Kellerman's latest, Moon Music. Two of my favorite authors have written boring, dull books. Why not try something different- I did love Michael Lee West's, She Flew the Coop, for instance."
1,I can't finish it........wasted too much time already,"I'm 30 pages from the end....still waiting for a plot. I don't care for the southern characters. I thought I would always buy her books the minute they were released, but now....after Hornet's Nest and this one.....I will wait, read reviews first. She's lost her standing with me............"
1,I was totally disappointed in this one....,"I have waited and waited for this book and I can tell you I thought it was just me, but after reading the rest of the reviews I know I'm not nuts. I hope she goes back to writing Kay Scarpetta stories, because this one does nothing for me. Half the time, I figured I was missing something with the story.Hardly any kind of investigation of any semblance. Come on now, painting a statue with poster paint ohh I am so scared.Anyway,don't waste your time or money. Thank God I got this out of the library. I am stopping trying to read this at page 253. I always try to finish whatever I start, but there are too many good books to waste my time with this one. I just finished an excellent book called CLOUD NINE. You will cry your eyes out with that one."
1,Defines unexceptional,"At some point this gifted writer may have to face that she's not good at satire and she's not meant to write comedy. The satire was half-baked, the humor was low-brow and contrived. The plot was weak, with too much time spent setting up events and jokes that just weren't worth it. The three regulars were insipid and bumbling. One character was ridiculed to death over a ludicrous, made-up accent that got very old very fast, and then annoying. The 'bad guy' was by far the most intriguing aspect of the book. Vile and menacing throughout the book he collapses in an ending that is classic Cornwell ie, rushed and unsatisfying. The 'victim' was a kid so unrealistically drawn as to be saccharin. Had Cornwell just done a dark, hard-hitting look at juvenile crime, letting her strong dialogue provide the humor naturally, Southern Cross would have been an exciting and compelling read. There was probably more detail on coon hunting than juvenile crime."
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT,"I was not able to finish this book. It is unusual for me to start a book that I don't finish. Everyone says if I can't finish a book, they won't even try to read it. I will think twice before I buy a hard cover book of Cornwell's again."
3,I agree with others that this is not a PC great.,"PC should stick with Scarpetta, but if she were to continue the series I would probably buy."
1,"Was a chore to get through, a poor, poor book",This book was so bad its not worth more word than this
4,Entertaining.,"This book was fun to read. I appreciate Ms. Cornwell's willingness to branch out of the typical ""Scarpetta"" mode and display her talents elsewhere."
1,Hiassen wanna-be,"The best I can say is that Cornwell gives a reasonable try to write in Hiassen's inimitable style. But a bizarre continuation of characters introduced in a totally different style in Hornet's Nest. While I laughed out-loud occasionally, it wasn't worth the time to read. Cornwell's much better at the Scarpetta-hard-bitten style."
1,"A ""Cross"" to Bear","This book is torturous, rambling, and a real downer. I made it to page 45 then turned on my television set--which was a REAL mistake; but please understand, I was desperate. Patricia, help!"
1,Stick to Scarpetta,"This is arguably PC's most incoherent novel -- and I thought she'd never beat Hornet's Nest on that count. I didn't care about any of the characters, couldn't follow any of the subplots, and as a Richmond native was highly offended by her portrayal of residents as idiots. Get over it Patsy -- leave the Charlotte characters behind and treat the city where you live with more respect"
1,Worst book she has ever written. Made no sense.,Southern Cross was way below the standards of this author. Perhaps she needs a break. This book made no sense what so ever. There didn't seem to be a plot and it was very amaturish. I was very disappointed and would'nt recommend this to anyone.
1,"dried up story, dried up characters","Cornwell continues the tale of 3 police characters from earlier books. The story has nothing but repugnant characters, even the heros. What's going on in your life, author?"
1,What a disapppointment!!!,"Have editors abrogated their duties? How did this book get published? There is nothing good about it. The characters are cardboard and contrived. The names are contrived and silly. Cornwell has Skarpetta down pat. Judy Hammer lacks a fleshed-out character and is only in this book minimally. I hope I am not reading Cornwell's mind and that she has not placed Hammer in Richmond so that she can bump into Skarpetta and share a book with her. Please NO! Ms. Cornwell, stick with what you do well and that is Dr. Skarpetta."
1,Whining characters have invaded Richmond.,"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's novels. For some reason, through the last several Dr. Kay stories, whining seems to have become the force majeure of the characters. I thought, when I read ""Hornet's Nest"", an excellent story with great characters, that maybe Ms. Cornwell had finally gotten beyond the whining. Well, I guess not. ""Southern Cross"" hadn't even gotten rolling good when the characters start whining. Crying the blues about this and that. Where's the story? Where's the plot?I don't earn a lot of money and my book buying is basically a tight luxury. I don't like wasting money and will waste not another cent OR library time reading any more of Patricia Cornwell's books. Sorry, Pat, but this constant whining of your characters has become more a distraction than character building. My recommendation: David Baldacci."
1,Worst book she ever wrote.,"If this book did not have the name""Patricia Cornwell"" it wouldn't have been published. It was bad!"
2,Where is Kay Scarpetta?,"Why not stick with what we like? Please bring back Kay Scarpetta and her crew!! Although this book was entertaining, I couldn't help wishing Dr. Scarpetta would suddenly appear."
1,Terrible names for the characters!,"I got stopped on about 30 pages into the book by the names of the characters. ""Butner Fluck""?, ""Weed Gardener""?, ""Mr. Pretty""?, ""Cloud"", ""Fan"", ""Fling""?. I love Ms. Cornwall's books, and maybe the plot in this one is good....I can't get that far. The names are too distracting and annoying."
1,Missed the boat,"I have read with excitement, most of Cornwells books, but this ""Southern Cross"" was truly disappointing. I just could not get into the book, and at two or three times put it aside. Due to having nothing else to read, I picked it back up and read a little more, It certainly did not capture my interest like her other books. Beter luck next time."
2,Disappointing...,"I thought that this would be more interesting, but it really wasn't well developed."
1,UGH,"If Patricia Cornwell hadn't written this, it would be on every editors ""z"" list. Stop, already. These characters are unappealing."
1,"Relax, Carl Hiassen","This is such an awful book. CH should sue her for the flagrant copying of his style, but it's okay Carl, don't even bother. The attempt is so laughable. I threw it out half way through. And she should have done so too."
1,Don't bother,"Those expecting the type of story and character portayal we have come to love from Ms. Cornwell through her ""Kay Scarpetta"" series will be VERY disappointed with this book. Ms. Cornwell has missed the mark by a wide margin. Kay Scarpetta, where are you?"
1,Southern Cross,This book is really bad - badly written and plotted and juvenile. I have no idea why it was published. It seems that each book she writes becomes sillier. Sorry to be so negative.
1,A Cross too Hard to Bear,I'm a big Patricia Cornwell fan. But this was absolute drivel. A real disappointment over all the other titles of hers I've read. The story line was stupid and the characters were as tasteless as dishwater. If I wasn't on Christmas vacation with lots of time to kill I would have chucked it after 50 pages.
2,Bubba meets the Keystone cops.,"Patricia Cornwall firmly puts tongue in cheek in this good ole boy version of the Keystone cops. Ready for a little kitsche? Ready for a little high camp? Then join Patricia as she assembles an all-star cast of Southern stereotypes, freshman English style characters, and an out and out escape from the rigors of a Kay Scarpetta novel. After having seen some of the worst of Richmond life myself (I once worked for VCU), I can only say that she really succeeds in bringing comic relief to a depressing situation. Her sense of exageration is a mite week, but she emparts the slightly-off flavor of the oh-so-Southern eccentric. My only regret is that she missed some of my favorite stereotypes. This somewhat Sophomoric read is just pure escapism--and what, I may ask, is wrong with that?"
3,"Had potential, but fizzled out somewhere in between.","I normally LOVE 99% of all Patricia Cornwell's books. I did enjoy Hornest's Nest, and found it refreshing. but I did not like the endeared pets, of the main characters to play such a major role. It took away from the realism of the characters, and story line. Ending came swift, and predictable with no climax, I was very disappointed. Title started off with a bang, and cooled off quicker than my first marriage."
2,An incomplete novel from a master.,"The characters never develop until the last chapter. Weed, a lost youth in today's world of computers and violence, is the only likeable character, but we never get to know him. Patricia Cornwell never gives Brazil, Hammer, and West a reason for their existence in the novel. Too wrapped up in their own personal worlds, they never seem to be able to interact with the other characters in the novel. Cornwell gives her animals the ability to think rationally and with emotion.....perhaps they are the only intelligent beings in the novel. The other characterizations are sketchy at best and the reader never connects with any of them. The one murder scene is described in detail and then dismissed from the plot. A true disappointment from an usually exceptional author."
1,Absolutely terrible,"Not only was the storyline awful, but her choice of character names, animal thoughts, and internet ignorance, were absolutely ridiculous! Not to mention BORING!!!"
1,Glad I only paid a penny!,I got this book through a book club after being an avid fan through all of the Kay Scarpetta books. This book had no plot and the characters were not developed at all. I haven't read Hornet's Nest and won't bother now. Drop these characters and their ridiculous names.
1,"this book could be summed up in one word, boring.","i couldn't follow the plot of this book. in fact after reading it, i wasn't even sure what the plot was. i regret buying this book. it took me forever to finish it. i haven't given up hope for particia cornwell. i agree with her other fans...kay scarpetta is the only way to go."
1,Was this book written by Patricia Cornwell?!?,"I couldn't find anything to like about the characters and the plot was hard to follow. I am a Patricia Cornwell devotee, but Hornet's Nest and Southern Cross are certainly below her caliber."
1,worse than Hornests Nest,"In the lat three months I have read every Kay Scarpetta book and finished all of them in a matter of hours. When I got to Hornets Nest I was very disappointed, so disappointed that I have reservations on buying Southern Cross. Now after reading the reviews I would not spend good money on it, I will wait to get it second hand. PLEASE BRING BACK KAY SCARPETTA PLEASE."
3,Much Potential for more character development!! More please!,"This book shows Cornwell's potential for getting beyond the run of the mill crime drama and going for the broad brush. I am in the minority it seems, but I see much potential here. The police story side of the novel was a little weak, not enough depth, but the other stories show promise. I especially liked the story of Smoke and Weed, the juveniles flirting with disaster. Cornwell should explore more of this kind of writing, with an eye toward the kind of scope of Tom Wolfe's recent ""A Man in Full"". She can do it!"
2,Not at her best,I've read all Ms. Cornwell's novels. This is certainly not her best. It doesn't produce imagery for me at all. I suggest any other books from the author but this one. Maybe Scarpetta could have saved this book!
2,Not at her best,I've read all Ms. Cornwell's novels. This is certainly not her best. It doesn't produce imagery for me at all. I suggest any other books from the autheor but this one. May Scarpetta could have saved this book!
1,SOMEBODY STOP HER!,"A really, REALLY bad book. I forced myself to finish it because I couldn't believe it could stink from start to finish, but it did. The book is a very amateurish writing attempt, a shocker coming from an author I usually like. Plot, characters, events, pacing, humor, nothing clicked for me. And this STOO-PID artificial speech she made up was right out of junior high. QUICK! SOMEBODY STOP CORNWELL BEFORE SHE TRIES TO BE FUNNY AGAIN!"
1,How Does This Happen?,"How can an author who writes such great Scarpetta books, that I can't wait to read, write such terrible books with different characters? I don't understand it. This book and Hornet's Nest were terrible, I could not even finish them. I also notice recently that others authors seem to have the same problem and if they deviate from their regular characters they deviate from a good book. It's like a totally different person wrote the book. What gives? I also think you need a choice of 0 stars, 1 is to high for this book."
1,Disappointing.,"What does it say about the book if you've been stuck on page 52 for the past three months? I love PC's books and usually read them in couple of days or even less, but this one was only disappointing. My hopes were up because I loved Hornet's Nest, but unfortunately this book didn't amount to much. Better luck next time? Or should we say, stop the mass production PC - PLEASE!"
1,Yuck!,"What a disappointment. I pre-ordered this book before I scanned the reveiws and failed to remove it from my shopping cart! What a mistake and a waste of money. Boring, disjointed and a dull read. I am an avid fan of Cornwell, but even I had trouble getting through this one!"
1,Very bad.,The only good thing I can say is that I listened to an abridged version instead of suffering through the complete book. The characters and story are very weak and predictable. Hopefully author will return to previous style.
1,"Terrible, horrible...., don't waste your money",Oh mister publisher just because her name is famous doesn't mean you don't need to read it before you publish it. This must have been what you did though. If you had read it you would never have published it. I can't believe that Patricia Cornwell wrote this terrible rubbish. Her other books are much better. If this is all she can write she'd better quit while she's ahead (behind?).
1,Don't waste your time with this one!,"At the moment I'm in the middle of reading this book and I'm only going to finish it to see whether it can get any worse! Oh, Patricia if this is the best you can do, it's definitely time you got a job!!! There are enough rotten books on the market without this one. What was the publisher thinking of to even publish this dribble!!"
2,Not her best stuff,"After reading all her books, this is off the mark for such an expert writer. Please consider us and write more of the Scarpetta series where there is depth of character and true suspense."
1,What was she thinking???,"As a veracious reader of Patricia Cornwell novels, I cannot believe that yet another has disappointed me. Growing up in Richmond, VA, it was always a thrill for me to follow Kay Scarpetta and her entourage of crime-fighting buddies through the ""mean"" streets which are all familiar to me This novel, however, is a sorry waste of words and a waste of my time. It is disjointed at best, and the plot--if indeed there is one--eludes me. It is sad to think that an author of her caliber is more committed to her large book deal by churning out ""fluff"" than maintaining her journalistic talent and integrity. What was she thinking???"
1,"Satire, or not, this book is bad",A poor attempt at satire. I considered the reading of this book a waste of my time.
1,A Poor Story,"I continued to read this story until the end because of my admiration for Patricia Cornwell. However, the story/plot was uninteresting, the characters too lightly sketched, overall a very dull book. I gave it one star because having lived in Richmond, I enjoyed the recognizable venues."
1,Southern Cross,"I actually want to rate this ZERO stars. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought it. What a waste of time. I was a big P. Cornwell fan, but not any more. The book is badly written, the plot is a mess, and the characters unappealing. Don't bother!"
1,rubbish,"I have always looked forward to the Patricia Cornwell books, but believe this one has broken the 'habit'. 'Scarpetta's Winter Table' was a big disappointment, but Southern Cross? The absolute pits. Gutter talk, ill-defined characters, and so-called plots that go nowhere. I suspect that this was an early Cornwell effort which was turned down at that time. Now, apparently, anything she writes can be published. For shame, Ms Cornwell! Your fans surely deserve better!"
2,"The ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" of detective fiction.","Southern Cross is too ridiculous to be a detective novel, to violent to be a comic novel. This is my first venture into Cornwell. I have been told that her Scarpetta novels are better. I may try one of them one day, but I am too astounded by this book to try another or her soon.Starting with a character named Buttner (called Butt) Fluck, aka Bubba, a blue-blooded southern aristocrat with an Austrian accent who speaks English like Chico Marx, and a thoroughly dislikable bad guy who is a well dressed, well groomed white guy with suspicious eyes, who gets sexually aroused by robbing and later by killing people.When one watches a farce on stage, on knows that all of the characters are going to interact with each other and there will be no outside characters. Southern Cross is just such a farce. The coincidences never stop."
1,It was the worst of times,"After having read this ""novel"", I long for the days of ""All that Remains"" and ""Postmorteum"". The author has attempted to write the worst book she could have written and she has been successful. There is absolutely no plot or anything of interest to hold the viewer's attention. West, Hammer and Brazil were far more interesting in the ""Hornet's Nest"". I will put this implausible puppy aside and wait for Grisham in three weeks. Let us hope that the author returns to Scarpetta next year. It is unfortunate to have go two years for a quality book from an author who has demonstrated such talent. Save you money and wait for the movie."
4,"very entertaining, good reading for those snowed in days","Featured Judy Hammel, West and Brazil again together. No Kay Scarpetta this time, but equally interesting."
1,This was junk!,"I am a huge fan of Patricia Cornwell and have read all her books. This book was one of the worst books that I have ever tried to read. Everything about it was just bad (plot, characters, etc). I can not think of one redeeming factor. My advice is to skip it altogether."
1,What this book needs is a good medical examiner!,Disappointment doesn't cover my feelings for this book. What happened to Patricia Cornwell? Who has kidnapped her and is writing books using her name? Please -- let's pay the ransom and get both her and Scarpetta back! I don't think an autopsy is necessary to determine what made this book stink. It just goes to show that a good book isn't necessary to get a good Amazon ranking.
1,a true disappointmet,"I was curious how other readers thought about the last books of Patricia Cornwall, becaus I found as well Hornest nest as Southern Cross: thin, not interesting and a true, true disappointment. Thanks heaven I did found an older Kay Scarpetta story I did not ""swallow"" before and I am back as delighted Cornwell reader. I hope Patricia Cornwell takes notice of her readers response...."
2,Do we have reason to follow this story-line Patricia?,"Only with ample reason should anyone read this recent release, if Hornet's Nest didn't satisfy you're P.Cornell fix, this will be a complete waste. I'm wandering if this story-line is going somewhere, is she trying to find another identity other than Scarpetta?"
1,Does not even warrant 1 star--not worthy of Cornwell's name.,"As an avid fan of all her books, SOUTHERN CROSS was a huge disappointment. It seemed like it was written by someone else. Characters were poorly developed, the story line was disjointed, and the story provided no sense of closure. How could an author as talented as Patricia Cornwell produce such an embarassingly sloppy novel. It is an insult to her talent and her readers' loyalty."
1,Not any where near her usual standard.,"I loved her Kay Scarpata series. This is not anywhere near the quality of her other books. It moves slowly, is boring. It reads as if it were written for junior high school aged readers. SKIP THIS BOOK!"
2,VERY DISAPPOINTING...A REAL LET DOWN!,"I've enjoyed all of Patricia Cornwell's books except Hornet's Nest and Southern Cross. I continued reading, hoping it would get better... it didn't! Too many characters, very confusing sentences...they didn't make any sense. The characters are boring. I'm sorry I wasted my weekend reading this book...PLEASE bring Dr. Scarpetta back!"
4,Essential REAL punk rock!,"While the Dils' handful of studio recordings are great, I've always felt that their best songs unfortunately never made it on to wax. These bootleg-quality live tracks of ""New Kicks"", ""Before The Law"", ""National Guard"" etc. only remind me of what a crime it was that they never got around to recording a long player, or at least more singles. The Clash influence is pretty obvious, but you also hear the Everly Brothers, Roy Orbison, and 60's pop (among other things) in the Dils' sound. As musicians and songwriters, they were head-and-shoulders above most of their peers."
5,great stuff,"What a great group! Saw them perform in Monterey in 78 (me and about 40 others). Did they ever look cool in just denim jackets and jeans. Also played a Hendrix cover as an encore...can't remember what though. Anyway, this is a good collection of songs from a band that should have been bigger, and probably would have been had they stuck to it a few more years (and lost the hammer-and-sickle tee shirts)."
5,Works like an OEM battery,"I don't know what the problem is when it comes to purchasing non-OEM batteries and electronics. As said many times before, they're all probably from the same manufacturer, just with a different label on them. I use this battery as a back up for my OEM batt., and it works so well that if I don't notice the label, I can't tell which is which. The performance is equal, and I suggest you buy one...or two for yourself."
1,Hell No!!!,"Who the hell said that they could copy and bands name, not only that, but also the name of the bands album too! They need to be ashamed!!!"
1,Trash. This is NOT ORGY. Don't get confused.,"Hey dudes, just so you know, the BAND is Candyass and the ALBUM is called Orgy. It's hella confusing, and Amazon should put some kind of disclaimer there. I'm giving this one star because i can't give it zero. Any band that has to rely on copying another band in ANY form deserves nothing. Although going from the ""What similar items do customers buy"" table on this page, it looks like a lot of people are making the mistake of thinking this is Orgy. The band is probably living off of accidental purchases. I'm sure the band are nice people but wtf! Couldn't you call your album something else?"
1,WHAT THE HELL?,What is this band's problem?? They can't just take Orgy's name as their own...I mean...okay did Orgy sue this band? please say yes. I can't even listen to their sound clip so how do I know this band is good or not...nm I heaerd from other people this sucks.You can't just steal names-totally unfairThe real Orgy kicks your candyass geez
2,Copy of Oracle Applications Documentation,"I ordered this book hoping to get some in dept knowledge on custom alerts, concurrent manager, and custom printing, as well as case studies on things to look out for. This book is basically a copy of Oracle Apps 11i documentation put into one book. If you took Oracle 11i concepts, Oracle Apps Upgrade, Oracle Apps Installation, Maintain Oracle Apps, Oracle Apps System Admin, and Oracle 8i New features you would have this book. There are no in debt examples of things to look out for or examples of the more complex areas of System Admin dealing with concurrent manager, alerts, printer setup and troubleshooting. If you don't want to read through all the Oracle Apps 11i documentation on Technet, but instead want it all ordered nicely in a book then order this book. If you want an in depth book with examples and case studies then save your money."
1,Dont get into any tussle trying to get your hands on it.,"First thought that this book was worht enough to get a copy of regardless of whatever means were used, but to my dissapointment the book turned out to be just another one of those also rans. 90 % Contents are from Oracle Applications Documentation."
1,Book Disappoints,"It really does not discuss financials specific issues - a lot of it is discussing Oracle tuning etc.No screen shots are available either .Most topics are not covered in any depth- Ex Chapter on Open Interfaces mostly explains autonomous transactions, bulk binds and invokers rights - not really open interfaces"
1,Don't waste your money,"Other reviews for this book say that it's just a reprint of the Apps documentation, if only that were true it might be of some value. I'm new to Apps and wanted a book that would give me the basics without having to wade through the App's documentation on-line. However, even at my beginner level this book disappointed. I feel like I've been conned."
3,Good but can randomly break,"We've had these goblets now for 3 years. Around six months ago, the first one broke and we bought an extra set of four goblets to replace the broken one and in the off chance that another one would break. Within the last month we've had two more goblets break and are debating whether or not to continue replacing the goblets or to buy a different set. It seems that there's some defect in the way the glass was blown because they only break when we are setting them in the dishwasher upside down."
2,"Pretty, but break rather easily","I've knocked over my share of glassware in my life. Sometimes they break, other time they don't. Knock one of these guys over and they're sure to break every time. That said, they're GLASS so... duh. It just seems that compared to other glassware, they seem to be a little less durable.That said, they're very nice looking, and are dishwasher safe (see other customer's comment about breaking in dishwasher)."
5,Love them!,These glasses are nice and sturdy. They look really nice and they can still be used by my five year old son without me worrying about them breaking.
2,Beware VERY Narrow cut,"When I compared these to the previous pair of Asics trail running shoes I bought I could actually see close to 1/2"" difference in the width. I have a narrow foot but these shoes are cut super narrow. If you need to put any kind of insert in your shoe (I do sometimes) beware. These shoes are cut so narrow your insert will probably not lay flat. These shoes were supposed to be medium width B. No way do they qualify. I'm very unsatified with this product."
5,"30+YEARS LATER, GURNEY'S NOVEL IS A CHUNK OF OUR HISTORY","This is a classic piece of American history. For those of us who were fortunate to live in the 60's, it will make you cry and it will make you laugh out loud. For younger readers, take a trip with Gurney back to a time when everything of the fertile mind was possible and ""far-out"". My favorite character: ""The Lone Outdoorsman"". Enjoy the ride and arrive alive!"
5,Too bad this book it out of print,"Gantenbein is a fantastic book. The inconsistency of the plot the other reviewer mentioned is intended and part of a certain ideology. Most of us are Gantenbeins, not being able to identify with who we are in reality and dreaming of another existence. I was disappointed when I found out that this fabulous book is not in print anymore, it would have been such a good presentsk"
2,College essay,"I think this book is very boring and I've got a little bit tired with the plot and the characters. I found this book extremely difficult to continue reading. Also the book is full of inconsistencies. But I think there are many good ideas and themes in this book, but they none developed. I don't recommend this book at all. Not only a story unsatisfying, but the writing style is extremely annoying as well."
1,"Grief, not Good Grief","I found this heart-wrenching tale of a a young girl's struggle with cancer, a la Love Story, to be depressing. I wept openly as my young child asked me questions about death, dying, human misery, suffering and the lack of justice in nature. This is better suited for older children, best for those facing an illness in the family."
3,So So Book,This book is poorly organized and poorly written but offers some interesting food for thought. Borrow this book from the library or a friend.
3,Was this my last self-help book?,"I read ""The Last Self-Help Book You'll Ever Need"" several years ago. Much like you, I was lured to it by the promising title as it appeared that all of the great wisdoms of the universe could all be found within this Persall's book--the last one I would ever need on the subject. Really, how could one pass up such a golden opportunity? Yep, I bought it and gobbled it up. It was basically a summary of the ""best of"" self-help suggestions that are out there on the market. Good if you are drawn to magazine style advice. Not so good if you crave details and depth. Overall, I found it an average read. Not great. Not terrible.So, was it the last self-help book that I ever read? Nope! But I'm quite okay with that and won't hold the author accountable for failing to stop my ongoing love of self-growth and personal discovery. If you take the plunge and purhase it, I can't tell you if it will be your last self-help book but it certainly wasn't mine."
1,worthless,"I owned sprayers for years and wish SOMEONE would develop a high quality sprayer that is easy to use and will last. This problem is the biggest reason why people don't take care of their roses as well as they would like to.This particular sprayer does not hold pressure, requiring you to pump the handle WHILE you are spraying, which is not easy unless you have three hands. At least other sprayers allow you to pump and then spray perhaps 5 bushes before you need to pump the pressure again. Poor design. I'm tossing it after this first use."
5,"Good, yet low priced.","I needed a reasonably priced sprayer for use around the house. I found this one to be good enough for general spraying duties. The thing looks and feels cheap, but I am satisfied with its performance so far. I use it with insecticides mostly. For less than $20, it will do the job for you. I recommend highly."
3,Not the best choice,The recipes are complicated and not a good fit for fondue parties nor family friendly. High calorie too...
1,Terrible!,"I barely made it through this. The sound is too loud and annoying, the actors don't ever really feel like they are into it (except Lando- he is fine). I would have much preferred a regular audio book."
5,My Favorite Of All,"in this enstallment we find our usual characters, Luke, Leia, Han & gang in quite an akward situation. in a plan to overthrow the empire and his greatest foe [yes, the emporer returns], Luke Skywalker joins the dark side, but soon finds he has lost control. all in all leia and han make an attempt to save him, but fail the first time, so at the last minute leia returns to convince him to rejoin to the alliance. this the first post Star Wars story i ever, and happens to be my favorite. it's a wonderful twist on Luke Skywalker's character, and i am almost reminded of the storyline of AKIRA, in the fact that someone previously good so can develop into something so evil. the style is very macabre, and the artwork definetly fits the story. i am a very hard consumer to please, so you'll have to trust me that this is an essential read for all SW fans. and don't forget the sequel: Dark Empire II-=-zulumaccamehota-=-"
3,Put the tape down and walk away slowly...,"This review covers the audio cassette book (2 tapes, 2.5 hours). I was pretty excited in getting this audio book, full cast, new sound effects, original music, etc. I just wish the story line would have been better. Perhaps the hard-copy books were good... It did have the feel of being over-edited. Each tape starts off with a cap/re-cap of the story (as if this was originally intended for a mult-week radio broadcast...which it probably was). The story takes place after ""The Last Command"" Thrawn book, and does a good job of filling in a lot of the details prior to ""Jedi Search"". I found it very informative, just wish it hadn't spun through so quick. What I get for an abridged version. Anyway, the acting was decent, and I really like Billy Dee Williams' part. Anyway, consider carefully before buying."
4,Star Wars: Dark Empire I,"This graphic novel provides a fair explanation of Luke Skywalker dabbling with the dark side of the force. But there is not a lot of character development and I really never got the feeling that he was on the dark side of the force, only that he was trying to trick the emperor reborn. The plot is plausible, but not well defined and many questions left unanswered. Now as for the graphics part of this book, they range from outstanding to average, but overall I would say it is a great book for someone who is not a star wars ""purist"" and is a really good read for someone aged 13 or younger."
4,"The best SW comic ever, if that means much...","This book reads like a fan wrote it. Rather than just zoom in on some incredibly miniscule aspect of the old SW movies and thus make as little impact on George Lucas' story as possible, this acts as the next chapter in the SW saga. They bring the Emperor back. This WOULD be awesome, if they didn't do it again in the two sequels to Dark Empire, which seriously cheapens Empire. This is a must read for all SW fans, but to tell the truth it really isn't that great. Mediocre story telling and questionable art is all you'll find here. Not that it matters, anyway. They brought the friggin Emperor back, dude! Just buy it, bite your lip, and read."
3,Wonderful story,"Comic novel, so it automatically loses a star to start off with. I ead this comic novel in about an hour or two. Good, but could not keep my attention considering I was not entirely interested, friend liked it very much though."
2,************************************************************,"The comic book is pretty good except for the fact that the author needs to take an english course, and they need to hire a new artist because the one they have doesn't draw realistic pictures. Other than that, I like it."
2,I expected more from a Star Wars story.,"I'll read any Star Wars, but I didn't like it. I like comic books, and I like the regular books. The plot was too loose, the characters don't look anything like themselves, and I was really disappointed in the end."
3,thats not luke,Some of the worst artistry I have ever seen. I only read these comics because I got tired of the novels kept citing things that happened in these comics. Did Lucas approve of this? He should already be shot for giving us episode 1? We can just add this comic and the first one to his string of offenses against his fan base. And what kind of story is this...? Luke finds trained jedi from the clone wars? I thought Anakin Skywalker was to bring ballance. Two sith - Two jedi (Yoda & Obi-Wan)
1,Not nice.,"This Graphic Novel starts some years after the Return of the Jedi movie. It shows how the empire reacts to the downfall of the emperor, and how a war for power emerges inside the ranks of the empire. Although it starts fairly nice it continues weakly and the reader loses interest. Only for Star Wars Fanatics."
1,BLAAAAAAAAHHHHHH,"First, I'd like to apoligize to the author. I am a writer and I know how it feels to have your work rejected! Secondly, I think someone needs to get me a basin because I am going to hurl. That was one of the WORST Star Wars comics I have EVER read! The only good part was the world devastators. That is what the star is for."
5,Just to clarify...,"Ok, first off, I really enjoyed this book. I've been searching for the Dark Empire series for awhile now and I can't believe I finally found it.Some people may not like this book, seeing as how I've already seen people saying that Anakin is the chosen one and it's stupid how after all he did Palpatine can just come back. Well, what you may not be aware of is that Luke is the chosen one, not Anakin. Luke is the one that destroyed the Daeth Star, redeemed his father from the Dark side, and reestablished the Jedi Order, and ultimately brought balance to the Force.Anyway, the book has a great plot, great description, and it's awesome to see how Luke develops/ I personally loved it. If you're Star Wars fan and you're looking for some new material, Dark Empire is worth it."
4,The best follow up to the Star Wars trilogy,"Veitch does a very good job of continuing the Star Wars saga in a Dark tone. Luke's charcter has grown and developed in a way none of the other Star Wars writers has succeeded in doing. No longer a whining farm boy, he has become an intimidating and foridable charcter. Veitch doesn't seem to know what to do with Han and the subplots invloving him and Leia are less interesting but overall this is a very good story."
4,excellent,This book is an essentail for any true SW fan. Kevin J. Anderson is one of the best star wars authors ever!!!
4,Luke becomes the apprentice of a ressurected Emporer.,"The opening pages of ""Dark Empire"" gripped me instantly, and I wasn't disappointed by the storyline. The characters are familiar and the technology and diversity of aliens, planets, and vehicles are worthy of the ""Star Wars"" name. The only drawback is that the artwork can become a bit confusing and sloppy at times, but a true ""Star Wars"" fan will be able to look past that. In chronology, it and its sequel ""Dark Empire II"" take place between ""The Last Command"" and ""Jedi Search"". It contains a vital chunk of the ""Star Ears"" saga, although this is a comic book with no novelization. Definately worth a look."
4,Excellent,I think this comic was one of the best star wars comics that i have read i have only read a bit up to where Luke meets the emperor but this is definently better than the second
4,List of Movies,"Supernova, Disaster Zone: Volcano In New York, 10.5 ApocalypseCategory 7: The End Of The World"
1,Did Not Fit My Truck With a Radial R4 Compressor,"This hose assembly did not fit my 1979 Chev C/10 pick up with the Radial R4 compressor, it looks like it would fit one with an A6 type compressor. What i had to do in order to make it fit was to carefully re bend the aluminum tubing very carefully to make it fit. It is working on my truck but, its not the correct hose. I was very disappointed with this error but had to make it fit or I would stuck without the a/c."
5,"Fabulous style, all others are bland by comparison.","Outstanding. His style moves you. With each cut, I think, that was great, only to be bowled over by the next. It is a long CD (over an hour, I believe), but I still didn't want it to end."
5,The Most Romantic CD I've Ever Bought,Syme has the formality and chops of a classically trained pianist and the heart and soul of a bar-room entertainer. This is a must have for romantic nites and to create a noticeable atmosphere.
5,Best show ever!,"The team from Saskatchewan has done it again! Corner Gas is an extremely witty and entertaining series that is both geared to adults but is still ""clean"" at the same time. This DVD set is the most user-friendly of them all, allowing the viewer to skip over both the opening and closing credits, as well as watching all of the episodes on the disk without having to go back to the main menu. I'm totally addicted- I can't wait for season 6!"
5,Still great - Season 6 is the big drop off,"Season 6 marks a real drop off in series quality - poor writing and non-committal acting, with a bitter undertone. You may want to avoid it. But this DVD, season year 5, stands up to the very best of the previous seasons. If you like what you've seen of Corner Gas, you should like these episodes."
5,Good intro to the topic,I have been interested in meditation for some time but most of the books offered were too new agey for my taste. I found this a good and easy to understand intro to Taoist Meditation.
2,Abstractions galore,"Four texts are translated. The first, which takes three-fourths of the book, is a series of short sections on abstractions such as Principle, Human Life, Old Age, Sickness, etc -- there must be over fifty such topics. The problem is that the abstractions are described using other abstractions, a series of countless assertions of undefined terms. The approach is completely didactic; very little logic is employed to support the assertions. At times the abstractions come one after another in a stream that is near gibberish. I kept trying, but I couldn't read it.The other three texts have exactly the same structure as the first: short sections on abstract concepts. The thinking is better in these texts, but I would hardly recommend them.I was sorely disappointed. The Tao Te Ching was the most influential book I've ever read. I liked the Chuang-Tzu. This book came highly recommended by a friend who studied Taoism for years. I'm sorry, but I think it's terrible."
1,"our musicals, ourselves",too bad he can't write one it's always the historians and critics who write about something they can't even do i'd be embarrassed to have his job and of course there's always a university too eager to hire someone like him.
1,WHAT WAS PAMELA MORSI THINKING OF?,"I have read (and loved!) all of Pamela Morsi, but ""Matters of the Heart"" proves that even such a master as Morsi cannot make diamonds of some situations. The hero, having recovered from childhood cancer, has hung around the heroine for YEARS, never telling her his feelings for fear of rejection. I suspect that Morsi thought this showed his devotion, but to me, it revealed his weakness. Then, the heroine becomes convinced that the hero is secretly gay. I know that Morsi thought this combination would be light and funny, but with two such tentative, hesitant characters, ""Matters of the Heart"" was doomed. I also read another novella, included in this book, and even though it was last week, I cannot remember one thing about it, except that it was work to finish. I won't read the third. In short, thumbs down on ""Matters of the Heart."""
2,Cheap Sounding.....,"21-May-08I love Chicago and have many old 331/3 albums, 45's, 8 Tracks and CD's... None sound nearly as bad as this set. Even the Live albums and Cd's to which I own are much better recordings.Do not bother with purchasing this set.. I only wish that I could have listened to sample tracks of this before buying. I would not have purchased.As in the discription : Import: A Product Of U.K. Manufactured in European Union... GB206 Noted as ""Gold Box""......................@12:25 PM EDT [ USA ]"
5,Great product at a great price,I bought this to replace a burned out drill and got the impact as a bonus. I got this for the same price as just the drill would have costed me at the HD. I love the impact and use it often. It gets into tight places that the drill can't. The batteries are a nice bonus as well because I have many other tools that they fit. I use the drill almost everyday for my job as an electrician. I recommend it to everyone.
4,How Sweet It Is,Plain and simple this music is inspiring in a haunting way and I play it over and over again while painting scenes from Italy in my studio. It's a must for entertaining and dinner parties. Can't wait for the movie.
1,Terrible!,"I cannot understand these reviews because what I heard was terrible! After looking at the film's site, maybe the filmmakers should find another way to spend their money and spare the world of Sweet Piece!"
4,A nice B movie,"For a B movie this one is very enjoyable. It is a car chase movie with a sci fi plot about a young girl that is a Sender. She has the power to move ships through interestelar space. Like Frank Herbert's Dune navigators but more pretty. So, the big bad government guys want her and the aliens protect her. I give the movie three stars for the entertainment value and five stars for the lovely Shelly Lether who plays the alien girl. She is out of this world."
2,Shelli Leather is the best thing in the movie,"not a great film , but the actress Shelli Leather makes it o.k"
2,Don't waste your money if you already have the yellow book,"If you already have the yellow book ""Questions and Answers to help you past the Real Estate Appraisal Exams"", don't waste your money purchasing the new book that was put out in 2000. It's the same book - just copy written in October of 2000. I made the mistake of thinking that there would be new questions since 1994, or the questions would at least be asked in a different format, but they are not. Word for word they are the same. So save your money if you already have the yellow book and just study it a little bit harder!"
4,Didn't feel like it helped much but I did pass,"I was nervous before this test and I went through and answered every question in the book. The actual test seemed to ask significantly different questions. The result, however, was I passed with over 90 percent. Can you argue with that? It must have helped."
4,Good.....But Short,"Songs included are: My Town, Someone Like You, Shut Up And Leave Me Alone, Fire In The Hole, In Between The Lines, Lover, Somewhere In The Night & He Can't Love You. There are also five demos on this release. Demos included are: In Between The Lines, Night By Night, And If You Love Her, hang Tough & Spanish Nights.Sounds quality is good and there are liner notes by Michael Stanley. The live cuts can also be found on the studio releases. They are considered bonus cuts. This CD is for the true MSB fan and collector."
1,Stay Away From This Product!,"The Pilot neon underbody kit is nothing but a defective product. I ordered a set for a Toyota Tacoma, and the two 48"" tubes in the set would not light! I returned to the store for replacement, and the 2nd set that arrived also had one 48"" tube that would not light! The store now has two junk Pilot sets to ship back, and has refunded my money. It is doubtful based on garbage out of the box that these lights would last for more than a few days should they past the test lighting before install. Don't waste your time on this crappy product. I'll be shopping for something more reliable from a better manufacturer!"
4,sprayer,I purchased item to stain a new fence I recently bought. I liked the fact that it can also be used for garden & lawn operations after the fence project is completed. I have only used it for the fence and it is working out pretty good. I spray the boards but have found I also need to brush it out with a paintbrush to achieve maximum coverage and minimal waste. Just using the sprayer alone isn't an option. Good value overall.
4,"Seems to perform well, even in cold","Contrary to the review below, I've had one of these in my garage remote for over five years. It's just died after a week of -25 tempts (I live in Minnesota) but it's served pretty well prior to that. I'll probably replace it with a name-brand battery this time to see if there's a difference, but I wouldn't hesitate to buy another GP if that was all I could find locally."
1,Dead Batteries,"Do not buy this item from Best Deal, they sell dead batteries.No response from them. Buy from someone else! Amazon did not back me up. Not worth the money to send back."
5,perfect fit,"This battery is used in a scant few devices , so it's very hard to find in most retail stores.It goes in my mailbox alert sensor. I knew that if anybody had it ; it would be Amazon ! Received the product in 3 days , and solved my problem !"
1,Low battery life,These batteries did not last long. I tried this brand because it was cost efficient but ended up not saving money in the end. I will not buy this product again.
3,"This is just one battery, not two",This item included just one battery. I don't know why I didn't notice this before I ordered. Most of the other 23AE batteries here are a package of two. If I had realized this before ordering I may not have bought this item.
5,great,I couldn't find this at any store or anywhere else. It was easy to order and it came very quickly
4,Just what I needed,Product shown is exactly what was sent and in working condition. I don't know how long it will last but so far so good.
3,Ultra Battery,"""Ultra"" in that the battery is labled ""Ultra"" vs. ""Super"" in my car remote. The battery works fine."
2,stylish but out-of-tune playing,"The playing on this disc is pleasingly expressive. Mr. Goilav quite obviously puts genuine feeling into the music. His sound is pleasing, although his vibrato makes me nervous (probably reminds me too much of my own problems on the instrument).In the end, I haven't wanted to play this disc very often because the intonation problems are too much of an obstacle to peaceful listening. Although I'd rather hear expressive but sloppy playing than sterile accuracy, there are plenty of other discs that satisfy both my heart and my ears.If he played in tune, I'd probably give this disc four stars."
2,The ellusive Koussevitzki,"It's not easy to find a recording of Koussevitzki's Double Bass Concerto, and Mr. Goilav plays it with honesty. However, if one was lucky enough to have listened at Maestro Orestes Urfe play it, I think one will never be pleased with any recording one may find."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this product a few months ago and have tried it a few times with the same results. It says that it should clear up within several hours, but it only makes the water more cloudy and never clears up. Whereas the water was cloudy before, after using this product, the water is so cloudy that the only solution is changing the water. Save your money. Crystal Clear works better and is usually less expensive."
1,This was boring,This book was a snore. It was so far fetched yet you could have made a killing by betting someone about what was going to happen next. The characters were quite flat and lacked dimension. Hannah was the most unrealistic and unbelievable.
1,My Intended....blah,"I'm sorry for Hannah's loss but 200+ pages dedicated to her coming to terms with it was depressing. Grieving process was handled in a sleepy state with flashbacks to their life when Drew was alive. I would have stopped reading it but I kept hoping that there would be a lesson in it some where. The Mother and daughter reconnected...supportive friends - that was good, but it just wasn't worth it."
1,Scary Gift,"This book was awful. I gave it as a gift for Mother's Day and have since regretted it. My Mom thought that I was trying to send her a message that I needed help desperately and even tried to make us go to counseling together. Fortunately, I was able to convince my Mom that I hadn't read the book but ordered it in a frenzy right before Mother's Day. She says that it was such a bad book that she couldn't stomach to finish it. I then read some of it and realized why my Mom was so upset. This does not show a nice Mother/Daughter relationship but instead one that should not be there at all. Biological ties does not make a relationship between both people a must."
4,"Engrosing, Touching Storytelling",This complleling story reminds us all of how important it is to tell our loved ones how we feel before it is too late - It gives a accurate picture of the New Jersey landscape and the people who live there - I couldn't put the book down - You need to read this book
3,Suggestting new new topic.,"Although I have never read this novel or any of Brandi's works. I really enjoyed these ""reviews."" I am guessing most of these polarizing comments are made by people reviewing Brandi Mantha's life, not her writing, which must be very colourful indeed......Maybe she should write about that."
1,Dull and Whiny,This novel was very dull and whiny. I read this without reading the reviews- big mistake. This book really stereotypes women in a bad way and even though the plot was boring and simply concocted it took the author a long time to get to it's point. I definitely don't recommend this book.
1,Blah,"I picked this book up for 50 cents and I got what I paid for. Since I've never heard of the author I assume that this is her first book, it shows. The storyline did not seem to flow or captivate which is what a talented author would be able to do. This made a mockery of marriage, just as these reality shows do. The relationships were boring and not well developed. Overall, I didn't find the book moving but rather disturbing."
1,BRANDI?,Were you ever molested as a child?You definately have some issues to come up with this topic! Please- do us all a favor and don't write another book. Please seek professional help!
3,Not her best work but one for your Janis Ian collection,"I was a little bit disappointed in this album since it seemed to lack the heartfelt feeling that Janis has expressed on other albums. However, if you are a Janis Ian fan, this is one you should add to your collection. If you are a new fan of Janis Ian though, I would recommend her classic ""Between The Lines"" or her newer ""Revenge"" album instead of this one."
3,one very good janis song,"i'm a big janis fan, i was disappointed overall but the two versions of one song were worth the cost of the cd. ""getting over you"" is wonderful."
3,"Pretty, but inconsistent manufacture","The glasses are attractive, but it is clear that there is little or no quality control as all four glasses have differing weight and thickness. It's a pity, because the design is nice. I can't help but wonder if this kind of outsourcing will ultimately be Waterford's downfall.They are good enough for everyday use, but they're not at the same standard as their crystal."
3,Mediocre value and indifferent quality -somewhat disappointed,These glasses have an attractive design but at this price point I expected something a bit more impressive. I also found the proportions a bit ungainly compared to the pictures. The examples that I received had numerous random small bubbles in the finish and the bottoms of the glasses had non-concentric rings and variable finish. The overall impression was of a budget product rather than a premium product. They are made in China by the way and not Ireland. Your mileage may vary of course. I returned mine.
5,Great speakers for the $$$,"I would like to write a longer review when I have some more time, but for now:I bought these speakers a year and a half ago. I did my homework on the web and in stores/homes listening to speakers, and although I liked some higher priced speakers more (particularly a pair of Klipsch that would've cost about $1000), I decided on these - a gamble, as I had only read a handful of reviews on the manufactures' website. I've been really happy with them. They look beautiful, they're built very solidly, and the sound very nice. You do not get the exceptional highs of Klipsch or the bass response of some other brands, but paired with a good subwoofer, amp, and turntable or CD player, these speakers sound really excellent.And after over a year and a half of use, I still don't see or hear any wear and tear."
4,"Solid, easy to use log hoop","This item couldn't be easier to put together. The ""hoops"" are connected at the factory at the top, while on the bottom the hoops spread apart and held steady with brackets.Unlike the photo associated with the 20"" model, there is only one bracket on this item. And the bracket connects directly to the bottom of the ""hoops"" and not the floor stand. This is not adversely affect the operation or appearance of the unit. I decided to reinforce the brackets with a couple of black plastic tie wraps to make it sturdier. Not sure it was necessary, but it made me feel more comfortable while loading and unloading the stack.Looks good next to my fireplace. If this design looks like it might work for you, I recommend you consider it."
4,Generic But Pretty,"This is a very pretty holiday album that's best used as background music for those holiday parties. I do prefer George Winston for some reason; maybe I hear a little more depth & spirit, but this one's still OK so it rates four stars in my book. ""Starbright,"" is a lovely song with a decent vocal by Kenny Loggins but it sticks out on this album and would be better suited on a collection with other vocalists, to my ear. Nonetheless, most people who like somewhat generic, pop piano music will like this album."
1,.No longer available,"I never got the product. Had to go through one of your link, company sent e-mail saying got the order, it never showed up. I e-mailed the link, it took forever for them to respond, said they sent it, but couldn't find proof it had been delivered, of course not, I never received it. Finally got a credit to my account. If Amazon doesn't have it, I won't order it from another link."
3,Could be better,"Nothing special here, just your run of the mill assemble yourself furniture. The finish isn't bad but not quality furniture grade. It's not hard to assemble but takes close to 2 hours as the direction are not the best. One note of caution if your trying to match to your existing furniture the finish is about 5 Shades darker than shown in the item decription."
5,Every Christian going off to college should have & read ofte,"I give every young person from our church off to college this book in the hopes it will begin to open their eyes to the truth that will be shortly challenged at most colleges and universities --- absolute truth.Sire does an admirable job of Chris' college life of the temptations and protections against the ""ism's"" of relativism, individualism and pluralism."" One might add consumerism and postmodernism to this list. Maybe Sire will in a rewrite.This book is winsome! Put it into the hands of the college students you know, or get and read it if you're now there."
1,This is garbage!,"I'm yet another victim of the chemicals pouring down the back from this poorly sealed sprayer. I though at first I didn't close the cap properly, or that maybe I caused spillage as I had to lean forward supporting the backpack's weight on my back to pull the cumbersome straps into place, but it's just poor design causing the leakage. The pump stopped working the first use, I took it apart, reassembled, and it stopped again halfway through being emptied. The entire unit tips to the side toward the pump arm and wobbles back and forth. Feels really unstable and takes too much work. A waste of money!"
1,Hudson 63184 Backpack Sprayer,"Bought one of these from the local Atwoods. The second time I used it, the spray cutoff malfunctioned and it would take several seconds after releasing the trigger for the spray to stop. Took it back and got another. After three minimal uses, the check valve went out. Ordered another set of valves and O-rings to the tune of 15.00 from Hudson. Used once and within 10 minutes an O-ring gave way. After replacing O-ring used once and then the check valve was out again. The straps are very uncomfortable and difficult to adjust, which is not really that big of an issue since the thing has rarely worked.Hudson 63184 Suprema Bak-Pak 4 Gallon Sprayer Poly"
2,Short-Lived,This product broke down on the fourth or fifth use - some tubing inside came undone - it is still to be seen whether we can repair it and how much trouble that will be.
3,Not so good!,"After receiving this product, we proceeded to use it and it started leaking all over my husbands back. We promptly packed it up and sent it back for a refund!"
5,great for baby/toddler,"This is my daughter's favorite toy! This is purrrrrfect for any cat lover! What a colorful cutie! Since it contains tons of different colors, it'll help toddlers learn what color is what."
3,A bit of a crisis with the author as well...,"This book was not quite what I expected, as it contained a lot of politics and not as much policing information as I would have liked, but that was the author's decision, so I cannot condemn him for that. But I would like to meet his editor and ask him or her what they were thinking whenever they sent this book to print. I found that it repeated itself way too much, and it seemed that at least a couple of sentences on every page didn't really make any sense, such as big words being used but with the wrong meanings. I did like the personal stories and the interaction that the author had with the mounties, but the history of how the RCMP became like a business wasn't really presented in an interesting manner. But if business info is what you want, then you should definitely pick up a copy of this book, and if it is policing information you are looking for, then this book is still a good buy."
3,Disappointed,"I love the look of the boot, but it didn't fit right. They do run small. Tried 8 and 8 1/2. Neither fit and I normally wear an 8. Sent them back. Decided they were not for me."
5,Best Boot Ever!,"I love my Uggs! I decided to get this particular style because everyone has the original style. I enjoy being different. I wear them with boot cut Levi jeans and they look great. I even wore them to a night club and I received so many compliments. They are very fashionable, if you live in NYC. They are very comfortable and warm as well. 90% of the time I wear them without socks. I wear a size 8 1/2 but I purchased a size 8 because they run a little big. They are worth the money and I can tell they hold up well in snow. Thanks Amazon and Uggs!"
2,Color confusion.,"These boots are cute and comfortable, but the colors are a bit misleading. Black grey shows an image that is black with a grey stripe, but they are actually a mid-light grey with slightly darker grey accents. No black. At all. I have ordered these 2 x. I thought the first time that the supplier sent me the wrong boots, so I ordered from someone else. Same thing arrived on my doorstep. I will be returning these as well."
2,Cute but!!!,These boots are cute and warm but heavy stiff and short in the toe box. Due to construction I don't think they would break in.
5,UGG Women's Adirondack Boot II,"It's been a mild winter, but I did have the opportunity to wear these boots once since ordering them and they were GREAT! After reading other reviews I was glad that I ordered a size 9, though I typically wear an 8 1/2; these boots are very comfortable, but fit snugly.I would definitely recommend them:)"
4,Importing to Spain,"Firstly , I love my adirondacks. However, all the people who said you need a half size bigger than normal are wrong! Mine are slightly too big! Also, I ordered my boots on the 19th of December. They took two days to arrive from the US to Madrid. They then took 28 days to arrive to my house. This was no fault of Amazon. This was the fault of Spanish customs. In order to release my boots I have had to pay a further 110 euros! Bringing the cost from 202 euros Inc shipping to 312 euros! It also involved an unbelievable amount of hassle. So I would just sayto anyone ordering from Spain to just be aware that it is much more complicated and much more expensive than it should be. Amazon give great service at a reasonable price, just a shame about the third world public services here in Spain."
2,Only for beginners,"All tips and tricks covered in this book are way too basic for advanced or even intermediata XP users. It maight be helpful for beginner, but those tips and tricks aren't something you cannot figure out by yourself. I recommand ""Windows XP killer tips"" if you want to learn more about the amazing tips that are hinten in Win XP."
5,Just what I was looking for,This netting was just what I was looking for. We use to keep our dogs from running through the railing on our deck.
5,The Slammin' Car Radio Sequence Song That Nobody Can Find,"A lot of people including me were trying to find that song that was playing during the scene when the police were driving behind Trish and Darry in the car (The rocking Jeepers Creepers song that was playing on the radio). The moment I heard it, I loved it. It was haunting and it rocked. I found it after a bunch of research. The title of the song is Peek-a-Boo and it's performed by Siouxsie Sioux and The Banshees. It's on their album called Peepshow. They were a great punk rock group from the 1980's. I play it over and over again at full blast and drive everybody in my house insane (haha). This is a great soundtrack and a great movie (scared me half to death), but if you want the rock version of the funky Jeepers Creepers (Peek-a-Boo) song check out Siouxsie Sioux and the Banshees. That song is slammin'!..."
4,Question,"I haven't bought the cd for fear that the song that I am looking for will not be on there. Does anyone know if the song that the kids turned to in the car being followed by the cops is on the cd? I really liked that song and when I hear it, I just can't get it out of my head. Please, someone enlighten me."
2,"Not for faint of heart?.....Actually yeah, you could take it","Yeah, I think this movie is by far the most binal horror movie I've seen , very then plot and tons of holes in the scenes. You never really get an idea of what the hell you're supposed to be afraid of and who some of the more important characters are, being the psychic and the brother and sisiter duo. You get info when they feel it's relevant and by that time you're already asleep. I love horror movies and I gave the stars for the effort made and the graphics and scenary, both musically and physically (yes, that was creepy). But overall, I suggest seeing more impacting flicks in that unknown-monster sort of field cause this one just doesn't cut it."
3,The Dark Hour,"It is difficult to judge this film. It is 70 years old, acting and directing methods have changed, the acting may appear to be stiff, it is better than today's talent."
2,What a mess!,"The items inside this set are pretty good...I just wish there were more colored atoms (as a beginner, I needed the colors at each end to be able to visualize the differences, and there just weren't enough of each color). What I really disliked about this product is the packaging...the pieces inside hardly stayed in their spots and the box never stayed closed. This equaled a big mess in my bag every day. I ended up having to use a rubber band to close it, but the pieces inside would still get kind of jumbled. I would not recommend this set, but based on the other reviews, I might have just received a lemon."
2,Impossible to ever re-close the box,"I barely used it. It is not very user friendly. There aren't enough pieces to work through organic chemistry, even though it was recommended. The parts never stay in their respective spots, making it impossible to ever close the box after its originally opened. It wasn't expensive, but it was still a waste of time, money and space."
4,A worthwhile product for the everyday orgo student!,"I was told this was required for my general chem, and orgo chem classes.For gen.chem. it was kind of a waste, since you can memorize shapes without need to visualize them.However, once I started orgo, and began conformations, this was a MAJOR help!There are also plenty of videos online on how to use them (not that you'll need it!)Good required item that I actually used!"
4,Thank you very much!,I am currently taking organic chemistry and I was so relieved when the chem model kit finally came through the mail. It has really helped me out with studying for orgo!
3,not what I was looking to buy,It was only instrumental. I wanted vocals. I have bought similar products and they were vocala and had printed lyrics..
2,Just Don't Buy It....,"I purchased this CD, anticipating deep, soulful Celtic Music, and what I received was a sort of ""Celtic New Age"" brew of elevator/shopping mall music that lacks any authentic depth or soul. If Lisa Lynn had simply recorded a cd of her own harp music, my review would have exceeded five stars. Her own genius is watered down and made tasteless by the lack of melody as well as the amateur sounding arrangements of the other instruments. The rather garish cover art should have been my first red flag. If you buy this one, you can't say that no one warned you..."
4,A GREAT SONG WRITER,I SAW THIS GUITAR PLAYER ON A CHRISTIAN TV PROGRAM AND FELL IN LOVE WITH HIS SONG HE WROTE TO ERIC CLAPTON AND I SEARCHED FOR OVER 9 YRS. TRYING TO FIND THIS SONG OR CD NO CHRISTIAN STORES HAD IT NO BIBLE BOOK STORES HAD IT [I LITERALLY SEARCHED FROM MICH.TO SOUTH CAROLINA] AND NO LUCK BUT THEN ONE DAY I LOGGED ON TO AMAZON AND TYPET IT IN AND TODAY I FINALLY HAVE IT [THE LORD SAYS THAT GOOD THINGS COME TO THOSE WHO WAIT] THANK YOU AMAZON...
3,Liked the concept but was disappointed,"I wanted to like this book--a comedic take on economics and why some places work and some don't. Unfortunately, this book was a little too slow and the jokes were only so-so. However, there were a few gems sprinkled throughout the book. I especially liked the chapters that analyzed the economic condition of Albania, Tanzania, and Hong Kong. If you're brand new to studying economics, this book may be helpful but if you've done some study this book doesn't bring much new to the table. Maybe the problem was that written in 1992, it felt too dated. Not a bad book, but its not a must read. If you want to study economics try Thomas Sowell for starters."
4,"1 part comedy, 1 part economics primer, 1 part travelogue","I expected this book to be funnier, but less informative - the jokes are OK, but PJ makes learning basic economic principles pleasant. If I were teaching an introductory economics course, I would make this required reading. PJ makes himself out to be a pretty radical libertarian, but I think this is at least partially because it makes for more amusing remarks - e.g., he believes that Siberia has too much virgin forest, and he thinks Hong Kong is a near ideal society."
3,"Good, but nowhere near what it claims","A funny, witty and well-written book but lacks the incisiveness it claims. Obviously you are not expecting a treatise on economics. But unless you share the cultural and ideological background of the author, some of his conclusions will appear pretty shallow, even from the point of view of humour. Overall though a good read, that provides you with some memorable anecdotes."
3,"Interesting, but definitely not an Economics Treatise","This is an interesting book, written in a light, readable, and humorous style. It is basically a travel diary containing a multitude of observations and conjectures on the state of various nations' economies, from Cuba to Albania and Honk Kong. While at times I felt the author reinforces many stereotypes, I felt willing to overlook these give the overall humorous tone and interesting subject matter.This book will not answer the mysteries of what represents ""economic value"", or the historical and social reasons for such disparity between many countries. But it does prompt the reader to reflect on some of these issues, and basically makes us feel good to live in North America."
3,"Funny, but not accurate","Quite amusing, but the chapter on Hong Kong reveals how little research was done, and makes me wonder how accurate the other information in this and his other books is. Maybe he just got idle in his old age. Where the facts don't fit his prejudices, he seems conveniently unaware of them. Sad that so many people seem to just accept what he has written, however. The aim of satire is to provoke thought, not mindless acceptance."
2,Economic Sucess...At what cost?,"Americans seem to place all emphasis on a country's GDP as a reflection of its quality of life. But this is a flawed method of evaluation. When the Exxon Valdez spilled its cargo in Alaska, GDP went up. When a holder of several maxed out credit cards gets another one and racks it up, GDP goes up. Over consumption is the disgrace of North America and this book points out that if a country over consumes(U.S.A.) its GDP is greater than a country that doesn't(Sweden)...big deal. Sweden just has cradle to grave health care, education, employment security, free day care, an extremely low crime rate, a civil population and an excellent environmental policy. I'll take that over the so-called ""American Dream"" anyday."
2,Eat the boring and get back to what you can be funny about,"What happened? The rude, brash and very funny author of ""Parliament of whores"" and ""holidays in hell"" goes straight. Fair enough to take a pop at economists, but if you can't be funnier than them then you're in big trouble.A mixture of the uncontroversial-to-obvious - Hong Kong's been a pretty successful economy, Tanzania hasn't - and the very obvious - Albania's a mess. The punchline is that free markets and laws work. Yeah, my sides split too.Most worrying is the tone. OK, you are a libertarian, fellow of the Cato Institute but where are the JOKES? Obviously, not only the PC are po-faced. This book reads like a slightly-more-daring-than-average economics textbook. (that's not very daring). There are about three laugh-out-loud lines in the whole thing vs about that many per page in his earlier books.Finally, claiming that Russia at the moment is anything but a mess is just a joke. But not a funny one. Like the rest of ""Eat the Rich""."
5,"His best since ""Parliament of Whores""","Very funny, even if you don't agree with the economics. If you do agree with the economics, it is great book to loan/recommend to non-libertarian friends for (hopefully) subtle enlightenment."
4,"An excellent read from P.J., as usual","As far as I can tell, the premise of the book, economic navel gazing, is just an excuse for PJ to go to various places and write nasty things about them. Which is fine as far as it goes for us fans of P.J. O'Rourke, but for those familiar with his prior writings there are no surprising conclusions on the subject of political economy. But heck, his stuff is always fun to read, though sometimes the effort involved in tying everything to economics an arrive at the conclusion that free markets are good seems to distract him from the equally, if not more important task of being funny."
5,P.J. is as funny as ever,"I was waiting for the release of O'Rourke's lastest work for a long time and, I am happy to report, I was not disappointed. P.J. pulls off something in this book that I never thought would be possible: he makes learning about economic princples both easy and fun. O'Rourke's sense of humor permeates almost every page of this book and even if you have only a passing interest in economic theory (as I do) you will still enjoy his trademark travel stories and his sharp wit. Overall, a great read. Now I have to start counting the days until his next book comes out..."
5,The Finest Work he has ever done!,"P J tackles the subject of economics, and does so with his own unique view of the world. The net result is this... he has taken a dry-as-dust subject uniformly hated by college sophomores and produced the FINEST teaching text ever written on economics.If you a civilian hoping to gain even a sliver of information from your typical thinkpiece on the IMF or the World Bank, you owe it to yourself to read this book.The combination of side-splitting humor and penetrating insight is unmatched, and I really wish he would try the same combination with other subjects.One final caveat... DO NOT READ THIS BOOK WHILE EATING!!! You may hit the paragraph with the STONE SOUP anecdote and choke to death laughing!"
3,A funny look at someone strenuously arriving at a foregone conclusion,"I enjoyed reading the book; it made me laugh even though much of the humor was too flippant and occasionally annoying when he passed off yet another of his pet opinions as the obvious truth.The major drawback of the book is that it is clear that the author already had his conclusions in mind before he set foot in any of the countries he visited, and he saw everything the way he knew it had to be. I don't even disagree with most of his points, but it bothered me that he was clearly sifting through a mountain of evidence to find the bits that support his point of view. He glossed over many, many ""troublesome"" points -- eg the free market that he holds up as the best thing for humanity ever invented... isn't even very free; he soundly thrashes the strawman of fairness while ignoring stability, invisible costs, and other pesky drawbacks; and he doesn't mention that no truly free market ever manages to stay that way."
3,An interesting but superficial book,"When I read the first few chapters, it seemed funny and authentic. Then, it came to the chapters about Hongkong and Shanghai where I have certain first-hand experience, I doubt if the author had extensive contact with local people or just had a brief tour. I learned that sometimes people look at things in very different views, which made me doubt if the first few chapters I enjoyed a lot were just because I didn't know the subject or I thought it in the same way as the author."
4,"Dated, but still funny","Obviously this book is now quite dated. But O'Rourke is funny enough to make it still a good read. Granted, his political view is naively conservative and not to be taken very seriously, but this is still a worthwhile read for historical perspective and his humor. In fact, the idiocy of much of his conservative thought comes more clearly into focus now that it has had time to play out, which should make it easier to reject like-minded political hacks and the current economic spin. Paul Ryan, anyone?"
1,WARNING: Contains no recipes,"I'm English, so when I hastily misread the subtitle as ""A Treatise on Home Economics"" I thought I'd found the perfect solution to our current economic ills. When the book arrived, I initially I felt foolish, but after reading the chapter on Wall Street I realised that I'd have felt MORE foolish if I'd WRITTEN the book.I read the next chapter, a sneering piss-take of Albania, and then skipped to the last chapter to see if O'Rourke had learned anything. He hadnt. And 14 years later he STILL hasnt learned anything; watch Alan Grayson own him on Maher.Usually I recycle so-so books through GoodWill. This one goes in the town's paper recycling."
3,"Irreverent entertainment, but with useful tidbits.","This is an irreverent look at capitalism in various forms, as much a (not uninteresting) travelogue as an economic critique as he describes his impressions of Wall Street, Albania, Sweden, Cuba, Russia, Tanzania, Hong Kong, and Shanghai. For most of the book O'Rourke sounds flippant and seems to be writing more to hear himself talk than to educate the rest of us.He brings it together in the last chapter, however, which has the same title as the book. He admits that capitalism (free market economies) can work. What differentiates good capitalism from bad is the wisdom in ""the clumsy set-piece speech our parents made in the heart-to-hearts they'd spring on us when we were really high. It's what we heard in capital letters when we brought home grades that looked more like a collection of Baywatch bra cup sizes..."" That is,Hard work.EducationResponsibility.Property rights.Rule of law.Democratic government.Works for me."
4,Travel is broadening,"And it helps you understand that economics cannot be divorced from culture. Equal parts entertaining, due to the author's encounters at the far ends of the earth, and educational, as he explains how conditions developed there as a consequence of cultural forces meeting economic theories."
4,O'Rourke Pulls Through Again!,"A well written piece of work that will keep you laughing the entire way through. It does not, however, explain anything about economics...but then again, he spent the first chapter enlightening the reader about his hazy pot filled college years and that ECON 101 never really did it for him."
1,A massive disappointment,"I was greatly disappointed by this book. If Mr. O'Rourke wants to argue the superiority of the free market, he should at least define it in some meaningful way. His argument that the NYSE is a free market because it cannot be affected by government ignores the obvious effect of things like interest rate policies. This book is not carefully thought out and far below Mr. O'Rourke's usual standard."
5,Shockingly immoral,"P.J. O'Rourke apparently doesn't care about those poor baby seals up in Canada, and he also seems to be shockingly oblivious to the need to think and say things that are morally right. He's very bad for this reason. Other people, like that fine man Chomsky, or his learned collegue Professor Harris at the Common Courage and Higher Morals Press can show us the way to truth and justice, while writers like P.J. lead us only to the moral quagmire, formerly known as classical liberalism. If I say something is bad, what right under God or Collective Values does O'Rourke have to indulge himself??? Besides, ""Steal This Book..."" is MUCH funnier."
2,How to Get Rich: Write a Book that Says Nothing but Makes People Laugh,"P.J. O'Rourke manages to dizzy his audience with a tautological series of stories, comparsions, and self-defacement and then nauseatingly spews empty paragraphs. Don't know what a tautology is? Read this book, you'll figure it out.An author either takes pride in his ignorance or banks on his authority. O'Rourke attempts to do both, the former almost always shining through the latter. Coming away, you'll feel like you learned something. Of course you did! It just took him 10 angles, 5 anecdotes, and 8 less-than-appropriate similes to convey a Macro 101 principle. If you want a good laugh, read this book. If you want someone who knows what they're talking about, keep looking"
2,Sweden's Not So Bad,"I was really surprised how O'Rourke came away from Sweden without ripping their social democratic welfare state to shreds. He seems to have learned a bit about how a humane version of capitalism could work. For that reason alone the book should be required reading for all rah-rah American free marketeers. Much of the rest of the book is immediately forgettable. I was very disappointed with the chapter on Wall Street, a very lazy reporting job, and not at all witty."
2,Don't bother,"Here is the only plus of the recipe book - the illustrations. They is excellent artworks all done in pencil (black, white and greys) but printed on poor paper that makes the black run distorting the pictures.The book tries to give a sample of a few recipes from too many countries and winds up not doing justice to any. She covers Israel, Persia, Turkey, The Fertile Crescent, Armenai, and North of the Sahara in only 136 pages.Some of the ingredients are way too exotic or unusual for a standard American pantry such as tongue and pineapple pate, Moroccan brains, etc. These do not even sound appetizing. There were a few interesting dishes for soup and lamb.The information on the different countries is interesting but there is not enough of any one country.I suggest you discover a Middle Eastern country you are interested in and buy a cookbook specializing on that country alone.I will tear out a few pages in this book and throw the rest away."
2,Too many typos destroy its trustworthiness,"In substance, this is probably a good resource with all of the exercises one has to complete, but I've only gotten to page 18 and I have found 4 typos/errors. As this is (fortunately) a library book, I've reached my breaking point and set the book aside to be returned. If I am finding errors in the intro/review section, how can I trust what is being taught once I get to the more advanced material? Or, if you don't remember (or know) the correct spellings, you're going to pick up some misinformation, or at best, be confused. I am really surprised that the publisher would be so sloppy with its Dummies franchise. Disappointing."
4,Lulu rocks 60's chick to DIVA,From 60's chick to today's DIVA she now is .... absolutely fantastic voice ... we need more dvd's of her videos ... maybe it's time to release a Greatest Hits dvd David
5,poetic and down-to-earth at the same time.,"This book is a welcome relief from the same old England, middle-ages type of fantasy. The book includes wonderful spirits of the Australian outback and a great love story, too. The writing is beautiful and full of wonderful images."
3,"pool great, pump sucks",The pool is great. We had one of the inflatable ring type the past two years and felt like there was a lot of wasted space and water in that. My children (4 age 9-11) get plenty of exercise and have fun. It fits into our small yard. Leveling was difficult and I did it without the help of my perfectionistic husband. The pump/filter doesn't pull the weight for a pool of this size. I've worked all week to get the algae gone. We're dishing out another $300 to get a salination filter and a better pump. I wish I had the pump from last year that came with the inflatable ring pool. That pump would have worked better on this pool than the one that came with it.
2,Be Warned!,"We bought this pool set a few weeks ago and have been really disappointed. When we filled it with water we saw right away that the pool had a pinhole-sized leak. We hadn't let it touch the ground when we were assembling it and were extremely careful to put it down only on the ground cover provided, so I'm all but certain the hole was there when it was delivered to us.Also, the pool cover tore the very first time we tried to use it, and the cleaning kit that comes with the set has just fallen apart after a few weeks of use. It is not worth the money!"
5,Wonderful Weekly Workout!,"I love this workout series. It is a full weeks worth of yoga consisting of 6 discs. The yoga practices are challenging and beautiful, and each practice has a meditation to go along with it. The reason I love it so much is because this is so much more than just a yoga practice. There is a very strong spiritual side to this practice, which is very important to me. I have been doing this practice for about 6 weeks now and I am feeling more and more fit both physically and spiritually. I have many yoga DVD's that I use, but with this practice I am never bored! Namaste"
2,Disapointed,I found that the pose sequences were off. I think he is not preparing the body for some quite difficult and strenuous poses. My body did not feel good after many of the classes.I also don't find the benefit of a 10 minutes meditation when the guy speak 6 minutes out of 10. If at least he could let the music play longer after he speak. I need silence to be able to go deep.
3,hula dancer,"Arrived in time allowed, but not the item ordered. Original more au naturel, somebody decided she needed a top, liked the slightly tacky topless version better, but too much trouble to send it back."
1,Don't waste your time !,"I gave this movie a chance because Zane was in it, what a mistake. Terrible doesn't describe it. I couldn't bring myself to sit through it. This movie should not be be in the $3.99 rental catagory."
3,The impoverished lord receives an unusual bequest...,"Nicholas is a farmer who just happens to be an earl...an impoverished earl who has been working hard for years to pay off the debts of his father and make his estates profitable again. He cannot even think of marriage...until his aunt leaves him a fortune in her will...provided he can teach her parrot to sing again!Serendipity and her sister have been left penniless and homeless as their father's title and estates have gone to a distant cousin, who, far from being willing to help them, has designs on Sera's virtue. Teaching a parrot to sing may be a strange occupation, but it certainly beats the other alternatives!The plot is a little far-fetched and the romance not very convincing, but I find this otherwise to be a very pleasant little story. I do find myself look forward to the next installment of Lord Nightingale's adventures."
5,A delightful read!,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading ""Lord Nightingale's Debut"" and eagerly await the rest of the series. The story was filled with humor and warmth and the main characters were so delightfully human and compassionate. The book had intrigue, but was a lighter story than some of her previous books and I especially enjoyed the ""frog and prince"" references. As always her vivid descriptions of the characters and settings were so well written that I could easily picture them. I would highly recommend this book to my friends and fellow Regency romance readers and it is a ""keeper"" as are all my other books by Judith Lansdowne. I never tire of re-reading them."
3,Lord Nightingales Debut,"Unlike the previous reviewer, I enjoyed reading Lord Nightingale. The characters were likable, the plot moved along briskly and there was the set up of the sequel which hinted at a happy ending for Eugenia, who deserves it. Ms. Landsdowne has a great technique for combining adults, children, (adults who think and act like children) and animals to create stories that entertain and amuse. Bring on more of Nightingale!"
5,Hard to find classic,"Great early Silver with some customarily superb sax playing by the great Hank Mobley. Other big names like Donald Byrd (an inconsistant band leader, but a GREAT side man) Doug Watkins and Art Taylor round out an all star cast. Swings a little less than some silver outings, a little cooler, which will appeal to fans of Miles Davis and John Coltrane's great 50s albums."
2,Bad Original Recording,"I don't know anything about root-kits but it sounded to me like just a bad minor label recording at the dawn of the Hi-Fi 12 inch LP era. Then I heard The Night Has A Thousand Eyes on the radio - same distortion. I think they played it as a warning. With so much Horace Silver on the market, why dampen one's spirit with this one. 6 PIECES OF SILVER is the Blue Note recording with Byrd and Mobley."
5,Makes it easy to find any topic within the cayce readings,Makes it easy to find any topic within the cayce readings.I love the speech feature.
1,The Totally New complete Edgar Cayce Readings.CD ROM,"I don't know why but it will not play on my DVD Player,nor mycomputer"
3,ok,crazy in love is a good enough song to get into the top ten and thats about it. beyonce' as a solo artist can do alot better than this. the wording is ok but it needed a little bit more thought than it had. she is a gourgous and very talented performer with a beautiful and i wish all the best for the future.
4,Highly enjoyable!,"What if you could compete in a reality show for a million dollars? Would you sacrifice your Christian viewpoints to backstab another contestant out of the game? With the world watching and you caught up in an intense survival contest, would your faith stand?This book is intense! I loved the way the characters were brought to life. Jack Forrest is a very believable character, and you really feel drawn into his world of competition. But as the book progresses, you find something even more sinister going on behind the scenes. Why was Jack selected out of all possible candidates?Jacobsen has done a great job with this novel. Sometimes the scenes cut out in parts where you'd like to keep reading, but that just makes you hang in there a little longer to get to that next chapter. An interesting premise done with originality."
1,the ultimate reality show,"I read a book a week and this was easily the worst I've read this year. The characters are predictable and boring. the ""twists"" are obvious and the open-ended conclusion feels unnecessary. I am a big fan of reality shows like survivor. This book was a complete waste of time."
2,Quit in 1 year,"Batteries don't hold a charge anymore and not sure if it is batteries or the charger. No instructions came with it, so don't know what all flashing red lights mean, but I'm assuming it's not good!"
4,moses and the journey to leadership,It is right on for anyone who is a leader or who has been placed into a leadership role. It is excellent for the person who wants to be a leader.Shows you how to deal with the challenges and struggles of being a leader for the first time.
5,I am proud of this record,I thought that this record is the best record I own I love listening to it at any time or in any mood i am in. In almost every song it seems like your learning something. it's like he is teaching you face to face on how life is. I think that he is a great artist and he deserves a lot of respect. His music is very chilling it reaches the part of your body that sometimes does not want to come out and show itself. I think that if any of you out there got the chance to be like him you could achive but he is the best upon everyone. If any of you have any spare change when your walking down a record asle in a store and you see the record. buy it...it's worth your money.
1,"Not Pure at all, Content 83% Alcohol","I am very disappointed by this product. Star Kay White is claiming to sale 4 oz of Pure Peppermint Extract. In fact it is 83% alcohol by volume. when you buy this product you are buying 3.32 oz of alcohol and only .124 oz of peppermint Extract (3.12% as labelled on the bottle). The water must account for 13.8%.The product is weak and diluted, not good for my uses. I don't need the alcohol nor the water. If you call this pure is must be pure 100% or change the label and publish the details on the site to reflect the true content of the product you sale.Thanks for reading.Michel Gerard"
5,different and great,"Farley takes a different tack with this one, and it works well. There is some real suspense in this one! The story is great and Farley adds a great book to his series about the Black. Read it!"
3,The Ghost Kovi,"This review is on The Black Stallion's Ghost, which was written by Walter Farley. A man named Alec is a horse racer and has a horse named the Black. For now he is in a ranch near the Everglades, and is keeping the Black in shape, so when they go to New York they will win the race. But when Alec takes a stroll through the Hammocks he is stopped by another rider. His mount was a stallion, but this man had a mare. The man strangely invited Alec to dine with him, and brought him to a mysterious house. This book tells you how people sometimes believe in anything. You should read this book, it will teach you how to fear your imagination. The author wanted you to get the message that all people have different opinions on their beliefs."
1,Bizarre.,"Along the line of his earlier strange book, ""The Island Stallion Races,"" ""The Black Stallion's Ghost"" is complete with a mad man, an ancient curse, and a mythical monster that terrorizes Native Americans who ride horses while they're in the Everglades. Farley does have to be given credit in that he beautifully reconstructed the atmosphere and feeling of the Floridia Everglades. However the plot and pretext is so outlandish and unbelievable that it prevents the reader from letting themselves slip in the world of the story."
3,A fairly interesting book for more mature readers,"Out of all books in his series I read, this was my least favorite. I don't like hearing how Alec gets all crazed. It sort-of makes the reader lose faith in him. Advice to a disapointed reader: try reading another book out of the series. The rest are really great."
4,great tones,These windchimes have a wonderful tone and I like them very much. However I would recommend getting the larger ones with a deeper or lower tone
3,"Corinthian Bells™ Windchime, 36""","While the Chimes are acceptable the length 36"" inches is not the length of the chimes, it includes the clapper, so the bells are much shorter than thought, my problem, be sure you take this into consideration when ordering Wind-chimes"
3,"Ordered many times, this time did not like it!","I ordered this product for many times, and yesterday I received it again and they changed chemicals which they add to Chlorella, now it contains preservatives and bitter compounds which is not really pleasant to take, I do not know what happened and why they did it, before I liked it, not right now!"
4,it's good for me...,"My health was like bad....and further skin was, too. first time, I didn't know they were serious problems, but it was not going to be good soon... so I thought I need to try for my health..so I changed my food and started exercises...And I chose chlorella... do u guyz know chlorella is the best food for health...that I found out a certain information...because..my health was really kind of suck...so,,, I chose chlorella....frankly, it is little difficult to say that chlorella is the best for me and made my health's going to be good... but I think chlorella help my healthy get back a little.... well~~~~ it needs long times, but actually this is kind of good food ......"
2,Disappointing,"While these rare operatic gems are certainly worth having, the present recordings are a disappointment. No libretti are provided, and the orchestra smothers the singers. The performers are solid, but the sound balance is terrible. Recommended only with strong reservations, until better recordings are available."
3,haunted ghost stories,"I thought this dvd would be more comparable to a ""Rose Red"" or ""Changeling"" styled movie, but in reality it is more like ""Unsolved Mysteries""."
3,Love the illustration,"I love the illustration...the spider is very cute and it is neat the way the bird and cat is peeking through the grass. My only disappointment is that I want to sing the song while turning the pages, but the words are broken up across too many pages. The way it is laid out the pictures go along with the story, but it just does not flow nicely."
3,Book is sideways,"Amazon's service was exceptional, as always, but the book reads sideways, which I find awkward. The illustations are beautiful."
2,Who is Texas Guinan - this book has no answers,"I was excited to see a biography of Texas Guinan available. I love the period of the Roaring 20s, silent film and the characters that populated this fascinating era. I was hoping to get some insight into this woman who epitomized the times. This book, unfortunately, is nothing but a list of dates and occurances. As many times as Texas was married, I never learned of her husbands or her relationships with them. There is scant mention on her friendships and the dynamics of her relationships with the many famous and influential people she knew. In other words, there's no insight into what made Texas tick. Indeed, I came away not knowing Guinan at all. I ended up reading about 3/4 of the book (with great difficulty due to intense boredom) and at last skipping to the end. It was a frustrating waste of time and money."
1,Ironic,"I find it quite ironic that the only person who gave this book a good review is the one married to him, although she uses the last name of her first husband to hide this fact."
1,One-hundred percent heresy.,"Anyone with even a modicum of Bible knowledge will within about ten minutes of reading this book see that it is total heresy. Clearly the author has no training or education in theology or the Bible. The author's basis for what he writes is a ""vision"" tied into a name-brand breakfast cereal. What he says is completely contrary to God's Word. As a Christian with an advanced degree in theology and an undergraduate degree from a highly regarded Christian university, I can say without fear of contradiction ... this book could only come from the mind of a person who is mentally disturbed."
2,not as advertised,"this belt is advertised as being 11 inches wide..it is not..it is barely nine and a half.this belt is also very thin and does not stay in place very well.if you're looking for something nice and sturdy that will offer a good, wide back support, you'll want to look elsewhere."
3,Its Okay!,"I got this belt for my husband to work out at the gym. It seemed rather thin and I thought the shipping was somewhat high. I do not know whether or not he has used it yet, do can't comment on his behalf."
1,cheap crap,"the seller states one size fits all. it was 10 to 11 inches to small to fit around me ,so i sucked my stomach in and it just made it to grab the edge of the 0ther side, well then the top and bottom rolled up so it was just covering a very small area of my belly,so i removed it and then the edge frayed all up with threads all over.and the black rubber inside tore. it is crap and i do not recommend it. spend a little more and get a good one."
4,It works,I didn't buy this to melt inches off my waistline although one could use it for that. My use for it is to keep my lower back warm and flexible in the winter. Works good for that.
3,Beautiful black and white photographs of people of Color,"Some of my favorite pictures and short stories that are included are the ones that show everyday people doing everyday things... Women in church hats, men sitting on street corners and in barber shops, children playing and dancing in the streets, 80 year young woman having fun with a hoopla hoop.There are pictures of famous faces...and the one that sticks out in my mind is the picture of Jesse Jackson and son on graduation day...the father son unconventional kiss.This book shows a historical photography of People of Color. Pictures that make you smile, pictures that touch you, pictures that make you proud and pictures that make you remember. The only reason I do not rate it a 4 or 5 star is because I would have liked to see more."
3,Improbable plot twist ruins otherwise good book,"This book, as with the previous book in this series, Just Desserts, has interesting characters, great descriptions, and good pacing. However, this book was ruined by an improbable plot twist...Without this plot lapse, the book would have been entertaining."
2,Does not fit,"FYI to all: This silicone case does not fit the 80g Zune. Description really does not mention which Zune it fits, so I based my buying decision on the picture (and the price). Pic looks like 80g Zune...but the case is a good 1/2 inch too long and is not snug width-wise either. The case, however, is well made and of a heavy duty silicone that would certainly protect your Zune without getting in the way of buttons.... but perhaps this is case for the 1st gen Zune or the lower GB models.(This issue has since been resolved. Zune size has been added to description.)"
2,another bad amazon download.,Downloaded the mp3 1-9-2012.4 of the songs had bad spots.Unhappy with amazon downloads.This is the second time I have had problems.
4,Great book,The book is well written. Randy Avera made a great job to describe his feeling about the Challenger Tragedy.
5,a must read,"A compelling first-person account of the circumstances surrounding the Challenger tragedy. Randy Avera's role in the investigation gives the reader an insider's perspective and uncovers the real causes. It's a wonder this book wasn't published sooner, considering the importance of what it reveals. A well-written story with stunning implications."
3,book description,"Discover the behind-the-scenes story of the Challenger crash, the people who investigated it, President Reagan and the Teacher-In-Space program, how NASA succeeded in Program Management of complex programs, and about the future of space exploration.Full-color Photo Gallery containing 44 dramatic and rare photos taken by the author and NASA."
1,Great performance and recording of uninteresting music,"I looked forward to hearing the two Liapunov concerti. After I gave them a listen, I removed the CD from the player thinking that I'll never play that music again. The music is very dull and boring, with melodies and harmonies of no interest and no vitality and dynamics. This is too bad because the performance by Milne, the orchestra, and the production are really good. Alas, wasted, nonetheless, on uneventful and dry music that has nowhere to go."
4,A good book for fans of George Will.,"A nice collection of the articles of George Will. If you are a fan of Mr. Will's writing, you will enjoy this book. If you are not familiar with his writing, this book would be a great introduction to his writing.This book contains a cross section of how Mr. Will views America, from it's people to events, from controversies to it's pastimes."
2,Sugar and Spice and NOT everything NICE,"I bought this book with a gift certificate. Half of the information was helpful. Common questions that I had hoped to be anwsered, like how to feed an infant, how to bathe small children, and how to get a baby to fall asleep, (where just a few examples)where not anwsered."
1,Not recommended,I bought this book when I first started sitting. It was too vague and not very helpful.
4,Informative,"""The Babysitter's Handbook"" is a very informative book for beginning babysitters who need to know some first aid, games to keep the kids entertained, and tricks to make them go to bed. Not only that, it explains (with pictures), how to change a baby's diaper, and get them to end their tantrums. It also features tips from young babysitter's like you."
5,Purchased for Maintenance Phase of HCG,I purchased this book when I got on the Maintenance phase of the HCG diet. There are some great ideas in the book. It worked out nicely! Thanks :)
3,Outdated,"We bought this book before our RV trip in 2003 which eventually resulted in our own book, ""99 Days to Panama"" (www.99DaystoPanama.com). We found the info mildly useful but not accurate, e.g. Hotel Guanacoste Travel Lodge in Liberia, Costa Rica, hardly has a ""trailer park"". We recently bought the 6th edition of ""Christopher Howard's"" version with a new cover but it is exactly the same as the 6th edition of Pritchards book we bought three years ago."
1,An Abysmal Guide,"The cover says New Sixth Edition. This means that every few years the edition number is revised, nothing else. The book is littered with references to Karl Malden's ""Don't Leave Home Without It"" American Express ads -- the book is that old. ..."
2,Need opdate,The information's regarding border crossing are just to old (more than 10 years) to be of any valid use today.
2,not to infomative,didnt find the book usefull @ not good information on border crossings.not recomended for budget travellers.no info on dangers . see lonley planet guid. or moon travel. use all your guids you should be fine i am planning a 4 month motorcycle travel of central america with my wife and we will update a travel log/book in detail for those of us that travel on a she string.
3,Its okay,"This book is a little dated. It was printed in 1997 and most of these countries are changing so fast that you probably need something a little more current to suppliment the book. However, it is still interesting reading and does have a lot of tips and information."
3,"I guess it's decent, but have nothing to compare it to","I felt the book was very vague and redundant. However' I've not read another SOA book so perhaps they are all the same. The editing and such seemed good as well. I bought this book to pass IBM exam 664. While I did pass the exam, I think all you need for this objective are the VW003/005 PDF files from IBM, not this book. THE PDFs are far shorter in length and get right to the points you need to pass the exam, without the added fluff that this book has.Overall, decent book if you know nothing of the subject, but a bit too much padding for IBM664/669"
2,"Highly theoretical, very small practical value","I read this book after reading Enterprise SOA: Service-Oriented Architecture Best Practices By Dirk Krafzig; Karl Banke; Dirk Slama. That is the best book on SOA in my opinion. So may be I am a little biased, but following are my comments:1. I found it highly theoretical. It tries to explain a lot of concepts, but does not use practical examples. This is in total contrast to the book I mentioned, which keeps the information interesting and readers can relate to it easily.2. The case studies sections seem to be done hastily and there is no practical knowledge which you can get from them. They seem to be simple applications of web services. The authors use buzzwords like hub centric architecture etc. to make them look different.3. Authors use all available opportunities to promote IBM products."
4,4 STARS,HOLA MINOMBRE ES OFELIA Y QUIERO SABER CUANDO DETENDRAN TANTA BIOLENCIA LAS MA MAS LLANO EDUCAN A SUS HIJOS COMOANTES LO ACIAN AHORA ELLOS ACEN LOQUE LES DE LAGANA
4,excellent source book,"This is an excellent source book, beautifully written and well illustrated. Most helpful to me in my studies."
1,Hey wait a minute....,"So, the track order on this is wrong! I ordered it and it isn't the right track listing shown. It has...Radio editSharam JeyConductor/CowboyVideoI am not happy at all. I wanted the Sonique mix.This sucks."
4,"Unique, striking and provocative erotica","I recently received this book as a gift from a friend who thought it would make a worthy and distinct addition to my collection of erotica. She was so very right!J. De Merlin's FEMMES MACHINES is a black and white collection of fetish photos. The settings and imagery are nothing like what is usually portrayed as ""fetish."" Dungeons and black leather are for the most part absent. Many of the settings are living room and bathroom settings in nature with MANY unusual medial props. However, the most unusual feature of De Merlin's work is that all of the models faces are obscured with enlarged images of facial parts or replaced by masks made of facial pictures.The strong soft-core to hardcore imagery is stunning. Repeated viewings of the pictures reveals subtle details and allows the reader to explore the emotional content behind the applied faces."
5,Wonderful Work,"There is no text in the book. The black and white pictures say all, leaving us speechless. The photographer is a daring artist, showing an extremely erotic work."
3,Good if bears are not around!,"The first time I was hit, the bear knocked it over! Know problem I'll run aircraft cable to 3 trees in a triangle, this will solve the problem! Not, this sow ripped the bottom of the feeder off that throws the feed out! You and I couldn't do this with a crow bar! Now it sits empty. Just something to keep in mind if there bear's in the area."
4,Dieter Moebius - 'Blotch' (Scatch Records),"Good late '90's solo effort by this one-time member of such krautrock ensembles Kluster, (later to become Cluster), Harmonia and Moebius & Roedelius. More in the electronic direction than, say kraut or experimental. Possibly too out-there for some, but still a worthy pick. Tunes that had me sit up and take notice were the inventive ""Meltaway"", ""The Tracker"" and the 12-minute fantastically tripping ""Im Raum"" (worth the admission price alone). A should-have."
4,More originality from an originator,"It's hard to imagine life without the wonderful exploits of Dieter Moebius. He gives humour and style (and more than a little warmth) to a genre that is characterized by its sterility and coldness. Electronic music need not be so, and praise be to Moebius for showing us. His music has always been kind of comical, with funny little bleeps and blurts, quirky and quizical. Childlike, in a way. Obviously, not all of his work is like that. He can do some blindingly non-musical stuff, but that is why we love him in the first place. He takes chances that other musicians quite simply would not. ""Blotch"" doesn't break new ground for Moebius, the artist, but that is not a bad thing at all. It's great to hear him do what he does best, and that is create this humourous, quirky and quite personal music with his feet firmly planted on the soil."
5,Must have !,"I first heard this album from a friend and I tell you, it's an absolute must have. The music is so soothing it allows you to get in touch with your inner self. If you listen under the right circumstances you could even get into a sleepy state that puts you in touch with your subconscious self. Fantastic! Highly recommended!"
5,Wonderful!,"This CD is awesome and a must for anyone, whether you've read the books or not. The music is inspirational and beautiful."
4,Not de Man's best work,"This book is a good introduction to Paul de Man's writing. I'm not unbiased, since he was one of my instructors at Yale in the 70s. I am aware of the controversy surrounding him because of his personal life and collaboration with the Nazis in occupied Belgium, but that is extraneous to this book.The strength of the book is its accessibility. De Man was reaching out to a more general audience than in the works published later in his life and posthumously by his many admirers and students. That having been said, it lacks some of the impact and depth of his other writings. Still, for someone looking to find out what all the fuss is about Deconstruction, this is the place to start."
1,A Boring and Pedantic Book,"by a soulless man. De MAn understands nothing about the texts he reads, adn the reason for this is that it is clear that he has no real love of literature."
3,You could do it but still depending on your knowledge,1. The price of this manual is reasonable.2. Some out-of-date information about procedures and parts.3. Too technical which is not suitable for car owner (who has little knowledge about car) to do maintenance trouble-free.4. Car owner could do approximately 25% out of 100% procedures of the whole manual. Please remember it depends on your car knowledge.5. Haynes publisher do not care to respond their customer's e-mail and phone call for asking more information in the book as they promised to do so.
3,Not all that it's cracked up to be.,"Like everyone else I purchased this manual to aid me in doing the general maintenance on my Civic. The pictures appeared to be a little outdated, but I did not pay much attention to this. The layout of the book is broken down by car system, which is pretty easy to follow. The bottom line is the book is not thorough enough in my mind, even for general maintenance. Key components were missing that were not explained."
2,Skipmpy on details,I was interested more in CR-V manual then Civic. This wasn't extremely helpful in my case. Hopefully book serves better for Civic owners.
3,Fair,"It is not as I expected. It will be great if more pictures come together, say how to change oil filters and picture to show the location, or some basic replacements with more photos. Some of the maintenance schedule is not the same as I found in my 2004 Civic, it may be need to cover the old 2001."
1,Don't Waste your money,"I had an 880 that went bad, then I bought an 880i that went bad (General Error). It is an old machine, I would not pay any amount of money for another. If someone gives you one, expect it to not last long. Buy a new model."
1,EXTREMELY LOUD @SLOW,"This printer should come with ear plugs .Did i mention it was slow ? It also has poor printing quality for the price.I would say if you are going to buy a printer , don't buy this one. BUY A CANNON !!! TWO THUMBS DOWN!"
2,"Disappointing, either sprays a handful or none.","I was pretty disappointed with this. I bought it to spray Sevin dust on my roses, but it is not consistent. You either get none or a big glob that looks like you threw a handful on them. Not worth returning due to shipping, but I can't recommend."
1,Doesn't work at all.,"Bought it a while back and didn't get a chance to use it until recently. It's clear that the one I have was assembled wrong as the pump is pumping air the wrong way. Typically this would be an easy fix, but you can't disassemble it to clean or fix either."
4,Running on empty,Does the job. Only thing I find a bit of a hassle is if the container isn't full it can be a bit of a pain to use. You have to sorta shake the dust into the tube from the container. Over all though it's pretty good.
1,Difficult to fill. Uneven distribution of powders,"I agree with the other reviews about this being an all or nothing duster. It either sprays a heavy layer of powder or nothing at all. In addition to that, it's a mess to fill. They opening needs to be larger. I always ended up with such a mess when I used this. Save your money and buy a different one. Mine is just sitting on a shelf, rusting."
3,_,"324 E. 13th Street No. 7, named after the apartment in which many of these tracks were recorded, chronicles the New Zealand singer/guitarist's progression from treacly, Leonard Cohen-esque ballads in the late '80s to the minimal yet spacier stuff for which he has garnered some acclaim today (see his collaboration with Chris Heaphy, Bardo Pond, Dissolve, etc). Aside from the blips and bloops of later tracks, most of this album is cold enough to form glaciers atop even the most unstable CD players. Check out his especially chilling reading of Wire's ""Used To,"" which would leave Colin Newman clamoring for a good sweater."
2,FWI,"Be advised, this ""collection"" consists of recent RE-RECORDINGS of the group's best known songs; hence the lower price. However, judged on their own merits, these tracks sound good and possess drive and energy. ZABADAK (used as the ""title song) lacks the great athmosphere and dreamy vibe of the 1968 original, but is re-presented here as much more solid and closer to a ""live performance""; less reverb but stronger drums."
5,Thank you Liz. My children were born to this CD. :),"There is something about the way that Captain April begins that is precisely right. Real April begins the same way. This cd is captivating from the very first note. As a whole, I would be hard pressed to say that I have ever listened to an entire CD that has been more compelling. That is quite a statement to make. I am so very glad that heaven has graced earth with Liz Story, and that she has graced us all with her music. Both her perceptiveness and ability are remarkable."
5,Over and Over Again,I have listened to this complete CD more than 20 times and each time I hear something new. The melodies are wonderful. It is great music.
5,Review of 17 Seconds to Anywhere,I really like this album because Liz Story treats jazz piano very differently from most performers and this particular group of musical numbers reminds me of another jazz artist I really like.
3,Sherlock Holmes: Exhumed Client,"Interesting video, starring Ronald Howard. I had never seen this cast of characters before for a Sherlock Holmes movie. Plays like a TV show episode, which it probably was. Quaint English accents, although the fake moustaches are a bit cheesy! All in all a fun view. Plays well as a preview to a full length feature presentation. I enjoyed it. In black and white. I felt like I got my money's worth."
2,Not the same as origionals,I bought these glasses to complete a set I had purchased at Macys. These glasses were made in China. They were heavier thicker and darker in color. This makes me wonder if they are real Waterford. The watermark wasnt even the same. I would have returned them but I bought them for Thanksgiving and they came the day before and I needed to use them. I feel I was ripped off by Amazon.
4,this is great John Tesh music,the previous review says he dislikes the music. that's stupid you can listen to the music you want to buy & if your not sure there's youtube. this is great John Tesh music it's what he does. I love it!
1,Windam Hill cashs in it's credibility,"i was always slighty suspect of the windam hill label, this confirms any suspicions i had that they have no real intent to bring you good music. I guess they have to make money somehow......"
2,Wiz is starting to lose his touch,"Well, I enjoyed the other books in the series, but by the time we get to this book, I just feel like Rick Cook is really stretching his story, leaving a lot of loose ends, and not really giving a whole lot to the reader other than a ""filler book"" for his next book in the series. There just wasn't a lot of meat and potatoes so to speak.Now, that being said, there were some clever references, and it was an enjoyable read. But it was one that I found I could put down throughout and pick up later when I had nothing better to do.I think there are parts of this book that feel like a Robert Asprin ""MYTH"" series with the cutesy demons he starts to roll out with. Overall, the end of the book left me with an unsatisfied feeling where I might try to read the next one, but only if I can find it at the library.If you're a fan and planning on reading the whole series, pick this up for a bargain price or find it at the library. It's not really one of his best works."
1,"Pamphlet, very little value","This is the first ""book"" I have bothered getting about glyconutrients. It is a short pamphlet with about four pages of real information - the rest was filler, only good for those that are completely lacking any nutritional erudition. If you want this much information just do an internet search and you will find more for free."
3,Fame is Flitting,"When I was in grad school I heard about ""American Humor"" but never found my way to it. Now, many years later, I found it, and found it rather unreadable--which may mean nothing. Perhaps its day has come and gone; perhaps a new day will dawn and it will resume its former fame. One never knows."
5,Where sharp technique and beauty meet...,"Although I've owned this CD for quite a few years now, only now did I start to listen to it at a compulsive rate. I bought this album because I'm a big fan of Michael Manring, but ended up finding that every single song in this album is a mini-masterpiece: contributions from some of the best musicians were put together here and the result is an album which transmits lots of good energy, and the music touches your soul through its beauty.A few performances alone would be worth the price of the album, such as Tracy Silverman's flawless version of Vivaldi's ""Summer"" on the electric violin. Or Lisa Lynne's highly touching song. On a lighter side, there are also wonderfull songs, such as the opening title, or Michael Manring and Paul McCandless' joint contribution.Windham Hill has sadly gone out of business a couple of years ago, so I recommend you get this (and other remaining worthwhile albums) quick before they become impossible to find."
4,One of the best of its type.,"This book was riveting and sweet and powerful, and was about the most memorable of the books I have read with this theme (boy/girl in trouble sent away to ""find themselves""). Cosmos/William came to understand a lot about himself without having to lose who he was and what he stood for initially, as did Cherlyn. Both could love each other without giving up self. Refreshing."
2,not what i expected,"I bought this video for my children, in order to introduce to them the fun, wholesome world of boxes. What happened instead was that they just decided to hide away in boxes all the time! I eventually told them ""enough!"" and put the boxes away in the attic, but that didn't stop them! They found it even easier to hide away for long periods because I never thought to look for them up there! It has gotten so bad that I cannot have any boxes around the house at all! Even the smallest boxes! I will sometimes find my youngest curled up in bed with a shoe box on his head, sound asleep, with that tissue paper that comes with the shoes stuck to his lip. It is wrecking my home! I will still be checking out Box Time #2, in case it offers a more healthy view of boxes and box activities."
2,Too Unbelievable,"Too over the top unbelievable for a book that was not meant to be. How can we truly believe that Thea would be allowed to go ""undercover"", find out so much so fast, and then return to ""work"" after her medical problem - just to name a few of the most ridiculous plot points?"
3,UI is horrible,"I got this because it was on sale (elsewhere) for $120, whichwas a good price for 2GB. But the user interface is horrible.I still have trouble getting it to start playing after usingit for 3 months. The friendly button on the front: donthit it! It will starting recording voice or FM radio.Once I get it to start playing, I'm happy with it. (ahh,that is, after I replaced the earbuds with better ones.)"
2,Direct line encoding files skip,"First let me begin by saying that I have the 1GB MP3 player, not the 2GB. Second let me say that I am disappointed by the line-in recording. I have about a million cassettes and don't want to bother buying all their CD equivalents. (In fact, not all the artists I have are even on CD.) Oh, the sound of the recordings is good, but the files skip even when you transfer it to your PC to play them. I'm really ticked off! I'm going to try to find the invoice it came with and ship it back to Tiger Direct. But before that I am going to attempt to upgrade the firmware with the files I found on the PNY site following the instructions in the Adobe Acrobat manual I found there. If it didn't skip, it would be alright. I also have a Creative Zen Nano Plus, but the direct MP3 encoding makes some of the music I record sound really bad. Oh, well, live and learn."
5,Great Overview Of An Underrated Vocalist,"Though it escaped many, UK vocalist Dina Carroll actually released an album stateside back in 1993 called SO CLOSE. This import BEST OF collects most of the tracks from that album, as well as songs from her UK sophomore album ONLY HUMAN and material from an unreleased third album. It's a shame Carroll didn't get more attention than she did, because she possesses a beautiful voice that lends itself well not only to adult pop, but more dance oriented fare as well. Highlights here include'Escaping','The Perfect Year' and 'Living For The Weekend', as well as two terrific covers, one of Dusty Springfield's signature tune 'Son Of A Preacher Man' and an exquisite reading of Van Morrison's 'Someone Like You'. Fans of first-rate adult/dance pop will not want to overlook this collection."
1,"Beware this seller. This is not the original,nor any of the known releases.","""LT 5029."" EAN: 8712273050294 ""Import""This is some random CD from ""Digimode Entertainment"" in the UK. It does not include many of the original songs from ""Sunshine Superman"", rather its an album of smashed together live recordings from who knows where, there is no information about when or where the songs were recorded. The jacket has no information, its a photo of Donovan and inside it lists a bunch of other available LT series CD's. Many of the recordings on the original and otherwise released ""Sunshine Superman"" albums are not even on this CD. The quality is really lousy.Sounds like someone swiped songs from the internet and downloaded a picture and made it in their basement. This will make a great frisbee, not worth sending back, which I'm sure the seller was counting on."
2,"Oh, Come On Now!","Donavan did some delightful, dreamy, and lovable pieces back inthe sixties. Not many appear on this disk. Even the ones that were included are inevitably versions that lack both production value and power. I hope a decent collection of Donavan's music will be made available. This definitely isn't it. Two stars may be generous."
3,Mildly entertaining,"I'm a lover of cozy mysteries, so when I stumbled onto this series, I was hopeful that it would be entertaining. I just finished A Catered Murder and will probably read the next book in the series, but there are a few problems. The dialogue is often confusing. I can't tell which character is speaking. The grammatical errors detract from the story also. It has not really been explained what Sean's medical problem is. All in all, this book is mildly absorbing."
4,A fun series!,This is an enjoyable series. The characters are fun in their own neurotic ways. Definitely a rising new author!
2,Did anyone proofread this book??!?,"It's really a shame, because the idea is there, and the characters are there. However, awkward phrasing, typos, misspellings, and lack of clarity in the dialogues make the story tedious and frustrating to read. I question her editor's judgment...It's too bad."
1,One of those bands that kills modern music even more,"Words can not describe how horrible this band is. How long did that song ""Bodies"" take to write anyway? 2 minutes? But I wouldn't be suprised if they didn't even write it. It probably came from some yuppie record exec. who is programing the music scene despite knowing nothing about it. Buy this cd and you will never get any respect from me or any of my friends.LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR! LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR! LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR! LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR! LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR! LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR! LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR!case closed"
1,...,"[In my opinion], they have no talent at all with the guitars, the riffs sounds basic, boring, and terrible. [I think] the lyrics couldn't really get much worse, either and the songs are extraemely repetitive, meaningless, and cheesy. It is a joke to call them ""hardcore"" or ""heavy metal"". [It seems like] they're just trying to sound like every other metal band of the past 10 years because they certainly don't sound like anything new. It boggles [my] mind why the song ""Bodies"" got so popular. I guess it seems cool to 10 year old kids that watch MTV all day and have no knowledge of good music..."
1,Terrible,"I don't own this CD, but I have heard enough to know this CD is terrible. This band is a typical band that has no orignal guitars, vocals, nothing. I like SOME of the Nu Metal bands but this is just not good. Don't get this CD please, dont contribute to a band that has lyrics such as...""let the bodies hit the floor.."" Please..."
2,Drown these fools,"Simply put, the production is horrible. This album sounds heavy not because of the riffs or drumming, but because the mixing is really poor. It sounds like you are listening to the music through a solid wall. This album is just an angrier, stupider version of godsmack. Actually, godsmack look like pioneers next to these guys. I can't believe dimebag vouched for these guys in guitar world recently. i guess it is the texas connection. The guitarist uses the same bag of tricks throughout the album, a little bit of wah, simple chord progressions. the lyrics are unbelievably mundane. Unless you are looking for this sort of ""run-of-the-mill"" metal, you would do well to pass on this artist."
1,hardly metal,"Drowning Pool seems to be following today's style of ""nu""-metal and keeps the trend going with this album. The songs seem dull and flavorless and the voice of the band seems to be mimicking that of its predesesors. With one hit, ""Bodies"" and no others to show for it, this album lacks what it takes to be even catagorized as metal. If you are a metal fan and looking to purchase something worthwhile and worth your buck, pick up any Machine Head cd or Sepultura cd. In order to get the best you have to go back to the beginning....."
1,The cover is nice . . .,". . . But that's about all. While I consider myself to have extremely broad taste in music, this CD simply lacks the skill and tallent to effectively qualify as, well, ""popular music"". This recording is selling on the basis of nothing more than extremely angry and quite dull lyrics. The music is average and the frequent screaming is annoying. Wind-up, in an attempt to break the culture mold once again, as they did with Creed, has signed a very average band with worthless songs. Buy at your own risk."
4,drowed in good music,"Drowning Pool comes out with there debute CD and is full of 11 Heavy Metal songs. They sound a lot like Korn, System of a Down and rock bands that have an electronic feel to them. I think this CD is a must-have for those kinds of music fans. I think the songs could be longer. I also feel very sorry for the friends and family of Dave Williams(singer)who died on August 14."
5,dp,"Strange, isn't it, that in reactionary, religious, right wing America all things rock are suddenly big. The latest rising stars are Drowning Pool, named after the film that was playing, oddly enough, when bassist Stevie Benton lost his virginity. Now platinum over there, and with the single 'Bodies' familiar as the theme to WWF Summer Slam 2001, the Texan quartet have their sights set on the metal hordes over here. It's a familiar format, crunching guitars churning out minor-key riffs over a thundering bass and drum assault, and the vocals of Dave Williams taking in all stops between plaintive wail and subhuman grunt. Their palette takes in the distorted melodicism of Deftones ('Tear Away') and the furious aural evil of Sepultura and Slipknot ('Bodies') while injecting an air of originality, a neat trick in such a notoriously derivative, cliché-ridden genre. Those disillusioned by the dominance of Limp Bizkit and Korn will find much here to admire."
3,All the Same Words,This Cd has some great songs when you first listen to it. But as you listen to it for the third or forth time you notice all the songs have poor word structure. The riffs are great but the band repeats the words over and over. LIsten to the words of Bodies. A great song but their are not many words to it. They are just repeated over and over. Typical for the whole cd. It gets boring.
1,why.....why...why,"sigh.....Why is it that most nu nu metal bands are completly talentless? We have our angry young male Shuvels, our completly annoying Boy Hits Cars, and worst of all we have our Goth wannabe (or you could call them Coal Chamber lite) Drowning Pools. Not one hint of originality in any song in this album. It's ALL filth, It's ALL trash, and It's ALL been done before. If you want GOOD metal buy Vision of Disorders new album From Bliss To Devistation. It blows this album apart."
5,ONE OF THE BEST,"This album is one of the best albums this year. If you like Slipknot or Static X then you'll love Drowning Pool. When I first heard Bodies I could not get the song out of my head. After that I was on a quest to find out who made it. When I found out it was Drowning Pool, I rushed to my local Music store to by this album. It's the greatest."
1,He Touched Lives....,"Sure, it doesn't matter wether Drowning Pool made good music or not, because I have an excuse. Dave Williams died, so that means I can give this album a positive review because of his dumb mistake. When the man said ""Raise your hand, your a sinner,"" He touched a place in my heart that I didn't even know was there. When he said God didn't exist, it gave me a really positive outlook on life.R.I.P. Dave Williams (Yeah Right, the man even said himself he hated God, we all know where he's going...)"
1,This proves it....,"that anything you call buzzworthy on MTV all the little sheeps are going to go running for it just to try and be cool. Nothing on this album is good at all. They are boring as hell. If they played at a real metal show they would get laughed off the stage (or beat up). That song Bodies is the worst song I've ever heard. Well at least they can count to 4 in the song. Well look for my new album of me singing in the shower cause MTV is going to make it buzzworthy and all the studid kids will go out and buy it and tell me how deep the lyrical content on it is. ""And when you dropped the soap that was so intense, you're music is so meaningful"". Catch my drift folks? Please have original thoughts and stay away from this album. Go buy Lamb of God if you want a good metal album"
2,"Good artist, bad songs","For everyone interested in buying this CD just because it has 'Bodies' and is wondering weather or not the other songs on this album or as good, let me save you the trouble and tell you right here and now that the other songs suck. Big time. They're just simply boring."
1,curse you all men,"why do you people buy this? why do you give these bands the time of day? how many korns do we need? there is ONE korn and ONE is enough for anyone. this is sickening. i'm going to start a pop band some day and the first album is going to be called 'take the money and run'. just like these guys! by the way they sound like a cross between korn and static-x but they didn't get lucky in the crossover. mediocre, boring, uninspired music. another part in this generation's hair band movement. do not buy. and say no to staind."
2,Counting Can Be Fun! (end sarcasm),"...The only worthwile songs are ""Sinner"", ""Bodies"" (I said it was nonsense, not bad), and ""Pity"" (There's that irony again...) ..."
3,I am a Sinner,"""Sinner"" by Drowning Pool is an alright album to listen to. I think that the first 4 or 5 songs are what help keep the album afloat, after that you may find yourself fast fowarding them. The lyrics are simple and repetitive and the music sounds alot like what is out there right now. Well that is not a bad thing, if the band wants to have a future they will need to come up with a distinctive sound of their own. If they can accomplish this, I think that they may have a future, if not, we might be watching them on VH-1 one hit wonders countdown or something like that. Like I said after the firts 4 or 5 songs it becomes a very average disc."
2,BAD!incredibly unoriginal even for nu metal,"I know I gave this a whole two stars but that's only because i kind of like ""sinner"" and ""sermon"" (im atheist) not that ""sinne""r has anything to do with that. I liked bodies when it first came out but then i realized how incredibly senseless that song was. how stupid is some guy who debues in a video on mtv shouting ""let the bodies hit the floor."" all of the songs sound amazingly alike and all of the lyrics are totaly pointless. This might as well be bacstreet boys, all their songs sound the same, are about the same thing, and they can't sing."
5,Critics,"Everyone wants to be a freakin music critic. You either like the sound of a band or you don't, or you have more important things in life to worry about. Seems like there are a lot of bitter people in the world who hate to see anyone have success. What I can about Drowning Pools ""Sinner"" is that it is the first record in a long time I did not skip through to hear only 4 or 5 songs. Drowning Pool keeps this record simple and to the point, and they rock. Thats all there is too it. It is a record to rock too and enjoy. For those of you that are that hung up on bashing bands, well mabye you should just get some once in a while."
2,another terrible new band...,"if you honestly think Drowning Pool is a good band, then you definately havent heard good music. The song ""Bodies"" is a terrible song, one of the worst ive heard in awhile. The only highlights on this cd are ""Follow"" and ""Tear Away"". Those songs actually have some good melody and chorus'. If you want some good new bands to check out, i suggest nonpoint, dry kill logic, or perhaps No One and Ill Nino(their cds are coming out soon!). Stay away from this album. The only reason its selling is cause of mtv..."
2,"This CD is ok, yet...","I am deeply saddened by news of DP's frontman Dave's death. Though I must say I did not truly enjoy this band, it is always sad when one passes. Drowning Pool were a small fraction of my first heavy metal concert of my 13 years on this earth- Ozzfest 2002 in Atlanta, Georgia. The excitement I felt that day will never be equaled. I enjoyed each and every band that day to absolute max; even bands I truly disliked had something over me...just the unity and energy of that place overwhelmed me. DP even played a decent cover of Metallica's 'Creeping Death.' I feel for the other bandmembers and all of their true die hard fans."
2,Failed!,"Well, in February 2002 when new metal was at a peak, I bought this CD for a tenner cos there was all this hype that they were a good band. OK, the first 3 tracks on the album are average, but then the rest of the album just goes off on a tangent, and it's crap! True, 'Bodies' was awesome the first time I heard it, but now...AAAAAAH! Boring, stop playing it you rock night DJs! I ended up giving this CD to one of my best mates, and I said 'keep it!'"
1,booooo,"I figured I may as well give this album a shot just to see what the buzz was about, big mistake. Never really a fan of ""Bodies"" I kind of was interested in Drowning Pool because of all they attention they were getting, while I forgot all the other... mainstream media gobbles up. This cd is terrible. If you're an MTV you'll love it, just like MTV...does, anything that has any kind of ""edge"" in any way combined with generic sounds and lyrics they will eat up. Don't let other reviews fool you, this band has no dark side and is simply posing as something they're not. Death metal, no, metal, no, not even hard rock. This is mediocre radio friendly alternative rock and you can just listen to the radio and find dozens of other bands who sound the exact same. This is a terrible cd and should be smashed by anyone who considers themself a real rock fan."
1,Drowning in a pool of mediocore copy cat bands,"I liked the song ""Bodies"" when I heard it, but that got old real fast. I thought that MAYBE by some miracle this CD (which sounds like the same thing that everyone is doing) would be able to offer something new and innovative to the mix. BUT, I was wrong. I am very very angry that I'm out the 8 or 9 dollars I paid for this CD, and wish I could get it off my hands. The songs, the style, the music...it's all been done before...WAY better than this. For your own sake, DO NOT BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!I warned you."
1,Unbelievable,"How is this group getting 5 star ratings? Are these people deaf or have they just never heard decent music? And the Amazon reviewer at the top called the lyrics smart? Whoever that is needs to be fired. A song consisting of the line ""let the bodies hit the floor"" repeated over and over by the worst voice I have ever heard is not smart. It is beyond dumb. The whole cd is beyond dumb, not that I bought it. I listened to my friend's copy for about seven minutes before I couldn't take the torture anymore. He gave it to me b/c he hated it. Well I hated it too, so I gave it back to him and it is now laying somewhere in the woods by his house, hopefully with deer turds and flies all over it, after it ""accidently"" fell out of his bedroom window. This group is extremely bad."
1,Mistake: 0 stars,"Let me laugh! This has to be one of the saddest things I have ever heard of life. If you don't know what I'm talking about, let me fill you in. According to Rollin Stone magazine, the drowning pool singer had been in 9 other bands before joining drownin pool. What do you make of that. A singer so bad that each bands kicks him out.... Anyway. The guitar are all similar and the singer just repeats himself. ""let the bodies hit the floor"" ""one, am i going insane, two am i going insane"" He repeats that till he gets to five. The singer constantly sounds like he's out of breath and man, don't even get me started about the drummer. Alot of people will argue, that the guitarists(or bassists I'm not sure) dreds are amazing. But no. If you want to see real dreds get some pics of Kevin Jardine, the Slaves ON dope guitarist. If you actually want to spend money I would recommend you forget about Drowning pool and you try a more original band like Spineshank or Slaves On Dope."
2,Believe me you could pull a better album out your A**,"Okay this is what always happens , some cruddy band has one good track ( in this case 'bodies') and some chump ( me ) buys the album and finds that all the other tracks bite .The other tracks don't even have the same style of 'bodies' - the lyrics of the tracks are so bad it'll make you laugh . Notice how there aren't many lyrics in bodies ?So one star for bodies and another one for the comedy value of the lyrics .Seriously do not be fooled if you like bodies , get the single , this album is presently a coaster ."
3,ok...but there is a whole lot better out there,"I read alot of reviews on drowning pool before i bought it i got mixed feelings some people said it was good others bad so i decided to go find out for myself. I only payed $7.99 for it and thats just about all i would pay after i listend. It has a few good songs like ""bodies"" and ""tear away"" but overal not to good. if you want a ""real"" heavy metal band go and check out Nothingface"
3,Could have used some major lyrical work,"My first impression of the CD was, ""Finally a good band that understands the genre of metal and hardcore"". Then I listened to it again. I looked at the lyrics and took a guess that a 5 year old wrote them. Come on, counting and saying ""nothing wrong with me"" 4 times is supposed to fill the void? Most of the stuff on the CD repeats, over and over and over. When you hear a chorus, get ready to hear it many many times. The CD brings a scary feel for 5 minutes then it fizzles and pops and finally burns out. The only way it saves face is because it has some promising vocals and instrumental power. If you want a better source of metal, stick with Steromud, Mudvayne, and Flybanger. If babbling about having nothing wrong with you is your game, pick this up and jump into the preschool class so you can count with the best of them."
2,More Corporate Rock anyone?,"The CD started out strong w/ ""Bodies"", but soon wimps out after that. Once again we have some Corporate Co. trying to cash in on the Hard Rock Machine, no wonder they are on the Oz Fest tour. I couldn't even finish the CD it was that wimpy. They should play the ""Lilith Fair""."
3,"Boring, but good live performance","i bought this cd with hope that it would good, i was wrong. it is very boring and repetitive. the choruses of all the songs are just the same 3 or 4 words repeated over and over too the point of severe annoyince. all those people complimenting them on great guitar, bass,listen to Morbid Angel,Cryptopsy,In Flames or some other music that has talent. if you are just looking for a good nu metal band listen to somthing good like No One, Drykill Logic, or Spineshank. I would have given this cd 1 star but DPs live performance is pretty good"
3,Don't hate this so fast!,"It's very easy for metal fans to dislike a band that makes it on MTV with their debut album. This is a solid first effort and cannot be compared to the junk(I would like to use a stronger word)that Limp Bizcut is putting out now. I'm referring to the reviewer that had trouble spelling the word ""ridiculous"". Anyway, just because a band gets some exposure does not mean that they are sellouts. This album has 11 original heavy metal songs(well ok the chorus of ""Told You So"" is kind of like the Deftone's ""7 words"". Unlike Bizcut, this CD is not trying to appeal to hip hop, alternative, and metal fans. It is consistent and genuine and lacks phoney urban slang, sorry Fred. Don't jump on the bandwagon and hate everything that Carson Daly is paid alot of money to like."
2,"Unfortunately, somewhat of a one hit wonder","Like many others, I bought this CD to get the song 'Bodies', which is angry, extremely energetic, and has a moderately fast beat.The remaining songs on the CD have a similar style of guitar and vocals, and the angry themes. But (in my opinion) not a single song aside from Bodies had nearly its level of energy. They're all slower. Most have great introductions, but then the chorus and main 'riff' just doesn't stir your pulse at all.Unless you absolutely have to own 'Bodies', I would skip it."
1,torturer,"This music is so bad it has been used to torture detainees in Iraq. The band is cool with it from what I hear. Idiot thinks their music might ""prevent another 9-11"". Nu-metal is dumb music and if played at high volumes it will break your mind, leaving you unable to ever suck less than you already do for listening to this inferior puke music."
2,Dont ever buy this,"Yeah the singer died but i'm not going to lie about the music just cuz i feel bad about that. The truth is this album DOES have 3 really great songs and 1 decent song,BUT every other song on here is a filler and some trash and this album is not worth buying.With that said, buy thier album Desensitized with the new singer, I am shocked and amazed at how they came back from an over rated bad album to a really great album like Desensitized. All I do is speak the truth and i am not biased in any way."
1,More dump bin metal scrap. Not good.,"Come on folks this is RUBBISH! It's dated, not very well produced and plain dull. Cliche after cliche. The same as a hundred other grubby metal bands waiting for their moment in the sale price dump bin. Don't bother."
4,Nice C,"I first heard of this band on Thursday night. I was up late watching MTV, and the BODIES video came on. My brother is in an Atlanta based Metal band himself, so I have become to like some of this music. I loved his song, since the first time I watched it. Luckily I had a tape still in his VCR b/c I was taping something else, and taped most of the video. It was the first he had heard it also...he thought it was pretty good, and now my whole family loves BODIES and i got the cd today."
5,"Drowning Pool Drown The World With Their Debut, ""Sinner""!","Drowning Pool have unleashed an onslaught of music upon us with their major label debut, ""Sinner"". Although the music its self isn't the most original thing to come off the plate of rock music, is surprisingly good. Their singer, Dave Williams, has a pretty good voice and can sing AND scream his way into your mind with songs like the first single ""Bodies"" and the song ""Tear Away"", the latter actually having radio success before the band was signed onto a major label. If you like bands like sevendust and coal chamber, you should check these guys out. You won't be dissapointed."
3,"not original, but still good","I heard these guys on the radio and thought I'd give'em a try. The first single is very catchy and heavy, but it really doesn't show anything new. This goes for the rest of the CD as well. If you're looking for something heavy to fill the void then give Drowning Pool a listen. If you want something really good get Static-x or Rammstein."
3,Not Bad BUT.........,i think that drowning pool has a good sound......BUT to me their sound is very monotinous. And the setup is too simplified. But it may just seem that way because i use the same amp as their guitarist. So my opinion shouldnt really be held in contrast with the albums real value. Im not denouncing them or up-lifting them. Im simply stating what i think.
3,It's ok...,"The music is ok, they sound a LOT like Godsmack. Their lyrics tend towards repeating a single line for most of the song. I give them 3 stars because I like the Godsmack sound they're emulating, but can't give them more because they aren't very original or interesting."
4,"""Let the Bodies Hit the Floor!!!""","Six years ago, I heard the song, 'Bodies' play over the Jason X preview. Until last year, I finally found out the name of it, because my ex-girlfriend was singing it. (This was back when I was in high school.) A friend of mine got me this CD. My favorite song is Bodies! I highly recommend SINNER!!!"
5,Sinners!,"This is a fun great CD. Very addicting, actually. I noticed that the reviews are either 5 stars or 1 star - people either love it or hate it. If you like what you've heard on the radio so far, it only gets better! PLEASE NOTE: THERE IS NO RAP ON THIS CD!It is DP's first release, and it has gotten great reviews from most publications. Sorry to Amazon, but check your local stores first. The CD was released for under $..., as some type of 'new artist' discount. But if anything happens to my copy, I would easily go out and pay full price for Sinner."
1,"Ooooh, I'm scared!...","I'm judging this CD based on the song and video for ""Bodies."" The lyrics attempt to be intimidating, and the guy in the psycho ward miserably fails to copy Metallica's creepy Sandman (even though that may not have been Drowning Pool's intention.) It's unoriginal, tries too hard to be ""evil"" and they give a bad name to good Heavy Metal music."
1,I'd Rather Listen To The Chimpmunks....,"You know it's going to be an awful CD when the first single is comprised of 10 words. ""Let the bodies hit the floor"" has to be the worst chorus line in the history of man. What are they writing about or implying? There is no direction in their music. If I would bought this CD I'd throw it out the window of the local interstate and watch a Mac trunk run over it. Wait, that's too harsh, why would we want to degrade the Mac truck. Just burn the cd."
4,Awesome CD,"Having gone to high school with Dave Williams, I may be a bit biased, but I definitely think this is the best band he has ever been with. I'm not a huge fan of heavy rock music, but I love this CD. I can't get ""Bodies"" out of my head, probably because it's played on MTV or M2 constantly, but it is really a great catchy track. The CD is just a bit too short. I wanted to hear more!"
1,Overweight morons rejoice!,"I'm a fat songwriter and this band opened the door for me in SOOOOOO many ways. I mean, Fear Factory did it for fat guitarists, and now whole bands can be fat! I mean, i eat so much food. It's obvious that the front man of this band was eating when he wrote all the songs. His lyrics are so insightful and they really speak to me!!!! Let the bodies hit the floor is such a versitile statement! I might even be about sandwiches! IN GUT WE TRUST!"
1,What Happened?,"I remember back when this review was worth 3 stars and everybody thought it was the biggest piece of crap this side of Montana. The lead singer dies of heart failure (supposedly drug related) and everybody gets all butt-hurt and starts calling Drowning Pool the greatest band on the face of the earth.So what's gonna happen when Britney Spears dies of Menengitis or Barbara Streisand gets eaten alive by a pack of wolves? Are you all going to build decorative shrines and 50 foot monuments in your back yards?Give me a break. Drowning Pool would have died out with all of the other Nu-Metal bands that nobody hears of or listens to anymore, regardless."
1,they suck,"all-right so called metal-heads, Choking Tub(drowning pool) is total ... Dont waste your money, cause they ... terribly. they all ways sing there girly song over and over just to make it more than 2 long bad music minutes. ..."
2,2 and 1/2 stars= Almost prety good.,"I kept hearing about this band and how great they are so I picked up this CD.This band is not as good as everyone is saying they are.Their record label is Doing alot to promote their record but this band is not living up to expectations.There are 11 trax on the CD but there are very few good songs to speak of.""Bodys"" is the song everyone hears on the radio and it's the best song.""Told you so"" and ""Pity"" are prety good too,but thats about it.Alot of the songs sound the same,and The drummer cant play.The lyrics are not bad on some songs,but on others they are down right stupid.But hey....At least they dont try to rap.the good songs I talked about before are worth listening to every now and then.This Band could have done alot better.They are 4 good songs and a new drummer away from being a prety good band.I am willing to give them a second chance when they release the next record."
2,Mr.Censored is right,"Instead of following the extreme overhype of this album, go buy New Killer America by Skrape or Anarchists of a Good Taste by Dog Fashion Disco. Something new and fresh to the ears. Unlike this band which sounds like something from Coal Chambers self-titled with David Draiman singing over it."
1,Pushover metal/nu-metal. Absolutely lame.,"Firstly, I'd like to mention that there is a good song on this album, Bodies. Secondly, I'd like to mention that it is the ONLY good song. If you have heard this song (which you have--LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR! LET THE BODIES HIT THE FLOOR!) and liked it, putting it in only a slightly lower category than actual death metal artists like Slipknot and Manson, then you won't like the rest of the album. However, if you like the lame, wannabe rock music like Sevendust, 3 Days Grace, Linkin Park, and Korn, then this will be just your thing. If you are not that much of a loser, I strongly suggesst that you DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!All the songs are sung in that annoying, whiney nu-metal voice, where the singer is trying to make it emotional by actually singing, except he can't sing. This is the stuff that's all over ""Hard Rock"" radio these days.ROCK IS DEADER THAN DEAD!-Marilyn Manson"
1,one hit wonder,"We- eeelllll...not much to say. Just a stupid one hit wonder band. ''Bodies'' was their one, big time hit. After ''Bodies''...nothing. All that stupid, poser, wannabe hardass song is good for is for stupid, overly cafenated15 year olds to make InuYasha, Elfen Lied, and The Ring AMV's to. And if you don't believe me, go to youtube.My cousin emails me stuff like that every day. Only idiots who like poser punk, and Elfen Lied (the most failed atempt at gore ever) will love this, and be uploading ''LUCY - LET DA BODIEEZ HIT DA FLOOR!!!'' as fast as this *snaps fingers*"
2,Oh Please...,"I've noticed the average rating had gone up for this album and I knew I had to say something. I'm sorry Dave Williams passed away, I really am! But that doesn't change the fact that this album flat out stinks. The rating on this album has only gone up because of the fact that all you people feel sorry that Dave Williams died. Give credit for what the album is worth, not just because of Dave Williams."
4,Great to listen to...,"...while I'm running around in a thunderstorm with a medal pole in the air. Though this album sounds like one long demo tape, it's still fun to listen to.Sinner - 8/10Bodies - 9/10 - I like this version over any remix.Tear Away - 7/10All Over Me - 9/10Reminded - 7/10Pity - 8/10Mute - 7/10I Am - 8/10Follow - 9/10Told You So - 9/10Sermon - 5/10This group seemed to always sound like a garage band that was signed on too early. They needed to incubate and find a sound of their own. But, anyways, they had a few good songs.86/100, not that bad."
2,Corperate Rock at its Hardest!,"Anyone who thinks Drowning pool is hardcore needs to listen to some real music. Listen to something actually hard like Coalesce, Snapcase, Poison the Well or Dillinger Escape Plan. Bodies gets annoying after two listens and the rest of the album is weak sauce. Do me a favor...spend your money on something that you wont be embarrased to listen to."
1,NOT GOOD ITEM,I BOUGHT THIS ITEM FEW MONTHS EGO. IT WAS DAMAGE FROM THE BEGINNING. I WAS TRYING TO COMUNICATE WITH THE SELLER FOR EXCHANGE IT BUT I NEVER GOT ANSWER.
1,Buy them individually,"I don't own any of these, although they are all great flicks. Unfortunately, this collection isn't a great deal compared to buying them individually. It doesn't offer any substance beyond the individual DVDs, only the convenience of buying them all at once.My suggestion would be to mix and match your own Arnie favorites rather than buying this collection. This collection leaves out the Terminator series, the Conans, Raw Deal, et al."
4,Nice book,This book offers some valuable insight to some of the major religions of the world. Some of the things I read about my religion were pretty interesting; even I was unaware of some of the information. I suggest everyone should read this title so you could understand people from other religions and their history better. It would make you more respectful to them too.
3,Great transaction!,"The Cambridge Illustrated History of Religions (Cambridge Illustrated Histories)Hassle-free transaction at a great price. The book was neatly wrapped for protection, thank you for that. I hope to do business with you again!"
1,An embarassment!!,"Amazon should be embarassed for offering this crap to innocent members of the public.This isn't even bad good, it's bad atrocious.Everyone involved with this movie should go find a rock and crawl under it. Hang your head in shame Amazon.com!!"
1,This movie is not a cult classic....,"I don't know why people think this movie is even worth wasting your time on. I thought that surely all these people who have seen it and gave it good reviews couldn't be wrong. But this doesn't fall into the ""so-bad-it's-good"" category, it's in the ""so-bad-it's-a-painful-experience"" category. Bad acting, bad film quality, lack of plot, and sad excuses for special effects are all fine and acceptable - when the movie is still good because of it. If you like zombie movies, then don't watch this. This isn't a zombie movie. It's a couple of idiots who got a video camera and found some air-head girls to frolic about in tight T-shirts. These things do not make a good horror film. Watch it if you like, but I will never expose myself to this pitiful excuse for a ""cult classic"" again."
4,Partially works,"Works fine in normal mode on my iMac, but not with the recommended ""Advanced Driver"" mode."
2,"Love B&S, very dissapointed with Storytelling","Very weak, borying, stale, and just plain dissapointing. After listening to this album several times, I'm embarrassed to say that B&S has been my favorite band for some time. Actually, they've released a few good singles over the past year or two, but the last two full-lengths are clearly not their best work."
2,B.S. B&S,"2 1/2Light offering of c-sides from these popular boys and girls takes advantage of sketchbook soundtrack-isms a little too heavily to be very memorable. Heavily orchestrated, the band rarely reeks of schmaltz, though hardly puts out any real sincerity either."
2,three degrees DIRTY OL' MAN like the group name a little chilly,"i love the three degrees but this cd is poorley recorded the songs arequite differnt then the 12"" singles i have also the sound is pooralso i really wanted the albun titled ""THREE DEGREES-THREE D, but is nowhere to be found a lot of the songs are re-mixed and excellent.also my favorite is DIRTY OL' MAN which i cannot find the 12"" mix which isawesome"
4,A book that spurred a love affair with baseball statistics,"I read this at the public library when I was in 9th grade. It was old, yet way ahead of its time and if I knew then what I know now -- that the very thing I was into at that time could've led to the job I wanted then -- I would've been a much more diligent student. But teachers mostly passed off my interest in these kinds of statistics despite their foundations in math because it was over their heads and beyond their interest.As it's been said, this book has been surpassed by other books in the sabermetric realm these days, but it doesn't matter. The fact is, if you're trying to get immersed into the field, want to understand what they're talking about and don't want to get confused by higher order math especially as a kid, this was a fabulous gateway drug. I bet a lot of public libraries might have it, which could make the search for it easier.An absolutely trendsetting book that was way ahead of its time."
3,Statistics without a foundation,"I have not read this book, but as a chess fan I would like to say that you need to have a large sample size before you can pass judgement using statistics. This is how Professor Arpad Elo (inventor of the Gaussian Elo distribution in chess) made chess a highly predictable encounter. With Sabermetrics and the A's, Bluejays, etc, perhaps the same will happen in baseball as in chess. But you need to have a large sample size, and the problem with baseball is physical injuries can make stats obsolete overnight (not as true in mind games, although chess players on occasion do go insane, and age is a factor even in chess). So there is always the element of chance in sport. But professional management is long overdue, considering how much money is spent in this sport.All in all a good book. I might even read it; also I recommend Michael Lewis' Moneyball."
1,Don't waste your money.,"This is by far the worst game I have ever played. The designers spent at least 90% of their time on the ""Pro Shop"" where you are supposed to pick out your gear--only you don't pick anything. You merely look at pictures of real products that appear to be cut from catalogs. The entire game is an advertisement for the sponsors. When you finally begin to play, you realize that the gameplay and graphics are at best equal to an 8-bit Nintendo system. I will never again buy any game in this series, (Extreme Headgames) as I prefer my advertisement free, and my games playable."
1,Extreme Watersports,"If this game had been shareware it still wouldn't have been worth the time & diskspace to download. Unplayable even by an experienced ""gamer"" who regularly runs 35 off. Save your money, you'll get more entertainment out of the free equipment catalogs. Antiquated, graphics & VERY choppy video even with a computer that far exceeds the minimum requirements of the software."
3,Didn't like it,OK but could be better. Was going to leeve it at that but need the words so I won't buy again.
4,Does the job!!,"I washed each of my dogs and then brought them back into my bathroom for the final dip.Pros: easy to mix, not too bad smelling, Was able to mix up one batch and use it on 2 dogs that weigh about 50 pounds each, watched the fleas falling off of themCons: Messy, must wear gloves due to its a pesticide, Dog shook it off all over bathroom, me, living room and etc.I would use it again, I just need to plan this out better by putting the a dog crate in the bathroom with a towel over it until the dog dries."
4,A good buy,I would have to recommend this cd to all the BT fans out there. Its a great double cd that has some old songs from before but are mixed okay. The first cd i would have to say is better than the second but still both put out a great voyage into trance.
5,THE BEST WORK OF BT,"I've been a fan of BT since i bought ""Movement in Still Life"" and did like that CD but his new work is much better because it contains some of his best remixes, so i recomend this Cd go and buy it"
3,Rehashes and Recylings,"BT is a good engineer, but only a mediocre producer. I was very diapppointed by ""Movement in Still Life"" from 2000. This is a far better release. ""Movement"" featured only a couple of interesting songs, and a whole lot of filler. Most of the material here on ""R & R"" is average and tepid to begin with, so all the remixing does is highlight how lame some of the originals were.There is nothing particularly rare here, and while most of the remixes start out well, the songs are so one dimensional, that the overall impact is actually boring.The DJ/re-mix concept has run its course. If BT (like many others who have tried to build careers by playing other peoples' music) wants to continue to release CD's under his own name, he needs to start CREATING new material, not just rehashing or recycling whatever he can scrape up from other people."
2,Barely New Songs...,"Is BT cool? Well,the thing is if you are either listening to a extreme creative band (For example:Kraftwerk) or listening to a less than the long well known Kraftwerk band or others who just have good music then you can slide this album and think--A:Is this good? B:Is this BAD??? this dosen't have a bunch of new songs. Period."
3,Decent.,"I enjoyed my first few listenings of the CD, but a few of the tracks feel a little stale compared to the work on other CD's. I have a few of his others and thought that a compilation would be a good way to sample a broad spectrum of his work. Maybe not.Although I'm not planning on selling the disks, they sit unlistened to in the door of my car while the others are in my visor case and slide in the player at least weekly.Buy this if you're a big fan and want a complete collection. Otherwise, stick to the other CD's."
4,impressive,"I do have to say, I hold BT to a higher standard than I would do to other musicians. I expect the best from him, and I would have to say he has consistently met my request.This CD is more or less exactly what I expected. I am satisfied with every song on here. However, I do have to admit sometimes it can lag. The best part of the cd could possibly be his remix of Remember. The songs with Tori Amos,Seal, and Grace are all extrodinary. I would believe it hard to remix his own songs and make them better (especially from his ""movement in still life"" CD), but he accomplishes this feat with Dreaming. I've heard 4 separate versions of this song now, and this one is definetely the best. It's definetely one for the collection."
4,Buy carefully,"If you are a chemical engineer, this may not be the best book to buy. There is really CD ROM with sample exams, but for only four disciplines. THERE IS NO SAMPLE EXAM FOR ChemE!"
1,FE/EIT Discipline Review by Potter,"I found the Civil Review lacking for test preparation. The geothecnical portion was OK, but the rest didn't help much."
4,Project Justice,"The game has great background graphics and the characters don't look that bad either. The combos are pretty easy to learn if you've played games like marvel vs. capcom. The game has hilarious team combos. The best feeling is when you finish off a character with a triple combo. A great deal for twenty bucks. I have never played the previous rival school games, but I can tell you that this game is perhaps the best of them."
5,Cozy and Warm Perfect for a night at the Garden!,"Perfect for sitting at MSG and watching the Boys in Blue. This is a great fleece I bought for my husband. Its lightweight but very warm. He wears it most days in the winter as his winter coat. The size runs a tad large, but nothing a wash and dry did not fix."
3,serviceable,"The focus of this book is to encourage activism. It begins with twenty pages of explanation about homelessness as an issue, and the rest of the book is about how young people can volunteer to organize fundraisers to assist the homeless. It presents several fictional stories about volunteers (another nearly twenty pages-all printed in italics) and follows with suggestions on how to help. The appendix includes examples of a flyer, petition, and letter.The large text size, the simplistic sentence structure, and the words in the glossary make this title most appropriate for upper elementary students: fourth or fifth grade. This title may help with reports about homelessness, but it would be most helpful in encouraging activism.Be aware that there are several grammatical errors."
2,After taste,"This is my first experience with Selenium Yeast capsules. This may be a characteristic of them all, however the aftertaste is a turnoff. I will try another brand to see if it goes away."
4,Really another book-the balance wheel,"This was a very good book by Taylor Caldwell, but I feel it needs to be stated that it is simply ""The Balance Wheel"", another of her books, or rather the same one, but with a different title."
1,Do Not Buy This!!,"My machine is broken once again. The display screen keeps going out. The first time I was told it was not under warranty. So I bit the bullet and paid for it. The second time it broke I explained to them that they had already replaced that part once at my expense, and it is broken AGAIN!! They still refused to pay for it until I showed them a ""service bulletin"" that one of their dealers posted online about defective displays(can't find it now-I'm sure they had that dealer take it off his website) and they begrudgingly agreed to fix it at their cost, but I had to pay for shipping. And today I look at it and it's broken AGAIN!! It's going in the trash as I can't bear to think about calling those rude ""customer service"" agents once again.BTW-I've only had the unit 2.5 years."
1,Freq repairs & horrible customer service,My product has broken several times. You cannot call them but must contact only through email. Customer service reps are rude and hang up on you. Do not buy this product.
1,Ozone is harmful and ineffective at controlling air pollution,"According to the most credible body of scientific evidence available:-Whether in its pure form or mixed with other chemicals, ozone can be harmful to health-At concentrations that do not exceed public health standards, ozone has little potential to remove indoor air contaminants, odor-causing chemicals, and viruses, bacteria, mold, or other biological pollutants-Some studies show that ozone concentrations produced by ozone generators can exceed health standards even when one follows manufacturer's instructionsFor the full report by the EPA, see here:[...]"
1,Not worth the risks,"I have tried the product and determined that its just not worth the risks for me and my family. Ozone (03) is a has is a irritant to humans and their pets. The unstable molecules will cause a burning sensation to eyes and throat. My best advises to research. Every sales person has one at home and they love it, and they will dismiss the unhealthy claims. There is plenty of info available at the epa's website that warns of ozone generating air purifiers. Also these are slated to be banned for sale in California later this year. Check out the details for yourself and decide for yourself. My goal was to improve the indoor air quality for my family and this product did not fit the bill. The site lists the 60 top offending products as well as some that meet the regulation today. One other note on the company itself who has changed its name 3 times....hmmm[...]Good Luck"
5,EcoQuest Air Purifier,"A friend of mine recommended this purifier. She was on medications for allergies to the dog and bird she has in the home. Her grandson, who lives with her, always had red eyes and sniffles. Since she got the purifier, she no longer needs meds and the boy is 100% healthy! It's a great product."
5,Good Fence for the Money,"For under 100.00 this does the job. Easy to install, instructions are clear. Fence ""perimeter"" is adjustable. I would not suggest this for anyone with a high energy dog that does not listen well. If a dog bolts towards something they can and will run through the fence. I have a 70 lb chocolate lab, once he learned WHERE is was, he is now more cautious and I do not worry about him getting through it.Overall a good product for the price."
3,Limitations on Installation,"I bought this and returned it after reading installation instructions and cautions. Wire must make a continuous loop with return wire at least 6 feet from outgoing wire. Wire must be 10 feet away from buried cable and electrical cables. Reception range is up to 6 feet from buried wire to dog collar. My property line is only 8 feet from my house. Between avoiding buried cables, and keeping the boundary wire on my own property, and finding a path to loop the wire back to the power source, the system ends up giving the dog much less space than I had originally anticipated. Also, I have a small 15 pound schnouzer, and the requirement for skin contact of the collar probes, and suggested cutting/shaving of the hair in the neck area, is just not acceptable to me. Since I never installed and used the product, I can only rate it on basis of comments above and appearance of the product parts (very nice)."
5,it's working great!,"Our super smart Siberian Husky, Zorro, has kept us busy since day one! My husband and I adopted him from another family who couldn't take care of him anymore, he is about three years old, and is the best dog I have ever had. BUT he gets bored while we are gone during the day and either jumps the fence or digs under it. I felt terrible about having to get something like this, but we had tried everything else under the sun, and living in the city, there is just too much that could happen to him and consequences for him getting out every day, that we decided to give this a try. I am happy to report that he responded very well in just a couple of days. Now, a few weeks later, I am constantly pleased to see him right where I left him each time I get home. (he is inside whenever anyone is home, but when no one is home, he is outside in the backyard)This was the best dog training investment ever!"
2,Dog learned that the shock doesn't hurt,"Our pointer pup was trained at about 6 months old on my parents' system (petsafe, I think). When we moved, we installed this system in the yard at our new house, and he understood the new boundary in a matter of minutes. The fence worked for awhile, but he has now come to realize that the shock doesn't hurt very much and the system no longer contains him.Bottom line: The shock isn't strong. If you have a dog that isn't a wimp, and who has a little bit of motivation to get to the other side of the fence, you'll have a loose dog. I give it two stars because virtually everything else works except for the strength of the shock."
4,WORKS WELL ENOUGH,IT DOES THE TRICK. EASY INSTALL. I HAVE NICE BEACH SAND IN MY YARD AND A VISITING DOG TAUGHT MY DOG HOW TO POOP IN IT AND PEE TOO. SO I PUT THIS IN AND SHE HERES THE BEEP AND STAYS AWAY. SHE IS A 65LB LAB.
1,ineffective,My 30 pound Puggle has no problem walking across the wire. I have tried it on myself and the product works but not with strength to stop a small/medium size dog.
1,Swap meet reject,"This is the first item I have ever returned to Amazon. When I got the product the box was beat up and looked like it had been opened before. The cable spool was in pieces, the AC adapter case was broken and had to be glued to stay on, the battery for the collar was dead, and the instructions were soiled. I don't know if this product came straight from Amazon or one of their vendors, but it was in horrible shape, something you would find at a swap meet or a garage sale. I have no idea if this product works or not because I never actually got it to turn on since the battery was dead. After I returned this I went to Bass Pro Shop and bought a remote shock collar that works beautifully."
2,Good points and Pretty Bad Points,"We have one of these fences. It was good for establishing a boundary in our backyard and far away from the street that the dogs quickly learned to respect, but, then we built a real fence and disconnected this one. The problem was neighbors' free-roaming dogs coming into our yard.The very worst thing about electronic fences is that, when you walk by others' homes where there are these invisible fences, the dogs come charging out to the boundary line. it scares you to death. You don't see the dog or know there's an invisible fence until you see or hear the dog come charging. Sometimes the dogs stop a few feet away, but sometimes they cross over the curb. These fences ought not be used in city settings."
3,Works but Rude Customer Service,"The Good: The system worked great: My dog ran after an ATV, under our gate and being zapped was enough to teach him to stay away from the gate. Now a collar is not even necessary but we put it on him anyway.The Bad: The box doesn't come with everything recommended. i.e. it does NOT come with the shielded wire needed to connect the ""fence"" with the unit. When customer service was called, he was rude and condescending."
4,In Ground Dog Fence by Innotek,This is a fantastic product. In 2 homes we've owned several. And decided to buy new when we were expanding our footprint and then again when we got another dog. LLBean sold us our first one. Sorry Amazon but if LLBEAN stands behind it that says quite a bit. No issues and no problems with the INNOTEK fences.
2,Not work on my dog,"Okay, I admit I didn't have enough patience to follow all the instructions on the DVD, which require methodological step-by-step training of the dog.It worked on my dog for the first few weeks, but somehow she figured out she can jump the fence by taking a little bit electric shock. Once this happened I couldn't figure out how to reestablish her respect to the fence. Of course I could increase the signal intensity, but the fence would become much wider and it would limit my dog's activity to a very small area, both indoor and outdoor (I wired the fence around my house).I think I am going to sell this on craigslist."
2,good item poor durability,within a week my dog would go over the wire with no problems it was still shocking her but it was such a weak shock it did not affect her and i even put new batteries.
2,Too much of a pain!,"Instructions aren't bad. DVD training video though looks like more trouble than my 77 year old Mom can deal with. She needed a sure fire manner to prevent her Mini Pin from digging out to go play with the two dogs next door and she had heard these work great and they probably do. But if you are a widow/divorced/single older woman or man that just can't get out for an hour every day for about 5-6 weeks to train your pooch with this system like my Mom, it just isn't going to work out. We are just going to spend additional money to sink some additional plastic fencing in below the ground line to create a bigger digging barrier. A real shame, if she had lived closer, we could help out with the training, but she moved to Florida to retire, we didn't. So we will get an RA# and ship this back!"
5,How to install on Florida grass (like Floratam),"Run your wire pattern first, test it, then get a rough cut wood saw. Cut through the grass to about a 2 inch depth, leave blade of saw imbedded to this depth, bend blade to one side and force wire down into earth/grass shoots. Work along only as you are cutting and burying wire. Takes a while to do, but seems to be the only way to get under this type of lawn!"
3,Zap!,Wow this thing has a powerful boot! This isn't some unpleasant little tickle. Our little miniature schnauzer took two massive boots from it trying to squeeze through the fence and yelped both times. It gives hardly any warning before it does so too. The bad thing is that because of the two boots it got to the point where she was just afraid to go outside with the collar on so in order to get her confidence back we took it off for awhile. We then put the plastic nodes back on so the good thing though is that since then she hasn't even tried to wriggle through the fence. The moment she hears the beeps she's already running for her life...I wish you could just dial back the power of the collar. Seems quite excessive for small dogs.
4,Works great but can not create a dead zone,It was easy to install and works great except for creating dead zone into the house. I followed the directions and spoke to 2 customer service reps. but after several different twisted wires hook ups I tired I still could not get the twist wire to create a dead zone so the dog can come into the house. Therefore everytime my dogs comes in to the house I have to turn whole system off or it will shock him. Customer service represetative was rude and just stated the same thing as the instruction stated with no other options for creating a dead zone.
5,One time that's all,"No way I was going to walk this dog around pointing to the flags and saying no-no for three days. Where I had to run the wire no way I was going to bury it under ground.What I did run the wire on the ground, place flags and put the collar on her and took her outside and pointed to the flags and said no and then I turned her loose. It did not take long to learn the word no.Now I am not chasing this dog and I Love it!"
5,Simple hook up and works,I have a 55 pound black lab. I installed the fence and followed the training outlined in the owners manual and it only took my dog getting shocked 4 times before learning the boundaries. He now has the training probes on ( they wont shock him but still beeps when he gets close to the line) and he hasn't even tried to get out of the yard. We have had other dogs and even deer come come to the invisible fence and he hasn't been tempted enough to test the line. Very easy to hook up although not a lot of wire was included. I had to purchase an additional 500' to complete the job. I have recommended this product to several friends since I have installed this.
3,Collar,"Collar was as advertised, but too small to accomodate a large dog. The collar will be OK as a spare for our smaller dog but can not be used on a Doberman."
4,"Good, Simple Dog Fence","Simple and inexpensive. Works well.Installation tips: Layout the wire where it is to be installed and test this. Next, using a flat-blade spade shovel, have the lead person step on the shovel a couple inches into the ground and pull it back towards them. This creates a wedge opening. The person a few feet behind them tucks the wire in and steps on the ground closing the opening.Easy to install."
2,"Works great, but you'll need to replace at the end of 1yr warranty.","The fence worked great. Bought in Dec 2009. Installed in Jul 2010. Had to replace collar battery in Apr 2011. Never worked again. A professional electrician checked the system and everything (transmitter, ground wire, ac adapter, collar battery) tested ok. Also, did the 10' loop test. The manual says this meant the collar was bad. Customer service was friendly, and charged about $30 for a replacement collar since it was out of the 1-yr (that's what 'limited-lifetime' means) warranty. The new collar came, but didn't work. The ac adapter had now failed. I replaced that. Then the transmitter failed."
1,Expensive Junk,"This product is plagued by breakdowns. The collar has broken 3 times in the first 6 months. First, the probes in the collar fell off. New collar, $56.00, long prongs, $9.95, overnight shipping, $15.00. Then our dog pulled the reciever off of the collar. New collar, $56.00, long prongs, $9.95, overnight shipping, $15.00. Then the cap on the battery came off. New cap, $9.95, new battery, $8.95, $15.95 for overnight shipping. If you have a long haired dog like I do, you have to buy the longer probes extra every time you replace the collar. The product was expensive enough to begin with without paying an extra $40-$50 dollars every time you turn around. I would try a different manufacturer next time, maybe invisa-fence. Even if it is more expensive up front, it would probably be cheaper in the long run."
2,It gets two stars for working for two days,"I have an English Bulldog who absolutely loves to eat our privacy fence so that she can say hello to our two neighbors' dogs. After about a year of cage training, yelling, and irritation over chunks of fence being torn apart, I decided to purchase this fence for the affordable price. Bad idea...I spent about two hours installing it and once complete I tested the collar and it worked! My dog got a taste of the zap for two days and by the third day she was used to it and now she passes through as if nothing were happening. I love my dog to death but no offense...I need a product that is going to give her a zap she wont forget.So if you read all of the other reviews that gave five stars because their fence worked for their 3 lb lap dog than know that that's the product's limit."
1,Junk,"Collar failed within two years, rarely used after dog was trained. Remote activator failed in second year, and used maybe twice. There is no excuse for making electronics that fail this quickly.Warranty is only for one year. They must know what they doing."
3,Happy with system,We are very happy with this system. The only comment I have is that the manual and instructional DVD do not clearly tell you what the range settings mean.
2,Good product - IN THEORY,"After researching the best way to keep my stupid dog off our lawn I went with the Innotek SD-2000. Followed the directions to the letter. Works great the first day but went through a battery. When I called in I was told that's common for the first couple batteries as the stupid dog is learning the boundaries. On the 3rd day the collar did not beep at all... 2 weeks later I had gone through 10 batteries, yes 10. So all in all it may be a good product for really large yards (1/2 acre +) but I can't imagine this works well otherwise..."
3,Good worked colar weak,weak strength. Worked but nt strong eonoph dog donsnt a a aa aamind it at all a a a a
4,Replacement motor for older stove.,This motor worked great for repairing an older stove convection blower. The mounting bolts and shaft had to be custom cut for the model I repaired.
4,Particle nuclear physics for the layperson,"A most enjoyable read and understandable, for the most part, for this non-physicist. The author communicates well the ""Wonder"" of the world of subatomic particles. For the first time I have some vague inkling how, on a very basic level, it all works together. Bravo Professor Kane! His excitement about extending the standard theory most likely with super symmetry is infectious. His dismay and disappointment at the cancellation by the US government of the super conducting super collider was apparent but not overstated. The glossary and index are really helpful so you can quickly look up a particular particle, force, etc. I would have liked to have seen more (simplified) diagrams of the particle collisions that lead to confirmation of various particles.Spoiler Alert of sorts!!!!This book was written before the confirmation/discovery of the Higgs Boson at the Large Hadron Collider."
3,What do you expect?,"For a sub $10 pair of ear buds, you can't complain too much. They have lasted longer than my Sony, have better sensitivity, but the absence of bass is driving to larger and more costly solutions.For sub $10 and if you don't care to get a large amount of trouble with little bass, this is your pair."
2,good sound but bad lasting quality,sounded really good but lasted me 2 months! left ear stopped working after that!
5,What a tragedy that this is out of print!!,"There are cooking cookbooks and reading cookbooks, and this is my all-time favorite reading cookbook. This is the kind of cookbook that it's fun to curl up with on a cold night, just to soak in all that good comfort food. Of course, there are many wonderful cookable recipes - the Cincinnati Chili, for example, is absolutely outstanding, and authentic. The roast pork with sinner stuffing is also superb. This is the antithesis to 90's low-fat nouvelle cuisine and other overly fussy fare. Fun illustrations, too."
4,Nice selection of Quotes,"This is a small, easily read book of quotes. There were several inspiring quotes and several famous quotes. Sometimes it seemed as though there were repeats of quotes or they were stuck on a theme. I wish the book was longer and referenced more outstanding speakers/thinkers. OVERALL... I am very satisified. I purchased this book as a resource for students it will fit well in the classroom."
2,Dissapointed,"I bought this book because the cover made my mouth water. I ordered it for a really good price and anxiously awaited it's arrival. Well, when it came I was extremley dissapointed. I do not recognize some of the ingredients in the cakes that I was interested in and alot of things seem geared toward experienced bakers. But the majority of the cakes in this book I would not even try. The cover is still beautiful though."
4,Inu-Yasha is Amazing,"This dvd contains the episodes 49 Kohaku's Lost Memory, 50 That Unforgettable Face, and 51 Inu-Yasha's Soul, Devoured. I like this dvd so much because through the three episodes it can be seen how much Sango truely and deeply cares and loves her brother Kohaku by the fact that she goes to great lengths to protect him from Naraku. This dvd is also great for giving for insight into many of the main characters of Inu-Yasha. For example Naraku's greatest power is using the feelings of others is shown, Miroku's bravery is shown, and lastly farther facts about how Inu-Yasha is conected with his sword, Tetsusaiga is revealed. The only down side to this dvd is that Sango's problems side tack slightly from the central plot of the developement of Inu-Yasha's character and his relationship with Kagome. But I would recomand this dvd for sure because it is a part for what makes Inu-Yasha so good."
5,You must have it,If the review stink I am sorry but I will do my best.It began that Kohaku (Sango Brother) was whis some old people Kohaku lost his memory by Naraku .The gang was looking for Naraku's castle but the casttle has a barrier so the can't find it.Mean while Naraku was looking for Kohaku becuase he ran away from the casttle so he ran away Sango found him Naraku summin alot of youkai to find him Inu- Yasha toll Kagome to stay with Kohaku in a tree .Naraku started controling Kohaku and he was going to attack kagome and the next episode started Sango started to fight with kohaku but kohaku still controled by naraku was his brother so she started to cry :( and let him escape .Next episode .The gang was still looking for naraku (too kill him dud)Inu smell human blood so they went to see .Im not goig to tell you this part so buy it but at the it so romantic Kagome was lian on Inu shoulder. (...)
4,curls,"I tried this product for the first time and I liked it. It created and held my curls without them feeling hard, crunchy and looking wet."
5,Keep my Curls,Great product and fast service. Can;t live without or my curls die :( Will definitely buy from this merchant again!
1,Why ?,"Why would someone do that to Destiny's Child ? I've been a big fan of Destiny's Child since No No No and hearing this just made me feel pain I feel sorry for DC I know they are sitting thinking why would they even put this on disc for distribution ? Truthfully I would like to know did anybody actually buy this, because if you did I would get a refund as soon as possible. Another before I leave what crack head did they have singing the remakes of the songs NO ! Just horrible it doesnt even deserve a one I think it deserves a 0-."
1,Let's Be Honest....,"Let me be honest, I don't own this cd, but after hearing the previews, I HAVE to give this cd 1 star, and that star is for them having the courage to make and actually sell this cd. I'm sure thier motive for making a tribute cd for Destiny's Child was right, BUT the result is quite HORRID. The Destiny's Child songs they chose to do have been butchered, and sound like a drunk singing at a karaoke bar. If you choose to buy this cd, I hope you enjoy it, but.....just go buy the REAL Destiny's Child cds, you'll be MUCH happier."
1,So Awful,This singer sounds terrible and kind of drunk. I don't know why someone would try selling this or calling it a tribute. This won't flatter the girls of Destiny's Child at all. They will be offended.
1,who is mixing this,pass this one by just somebody trying to cash in make some sorry songs and sell them cause they know somebody will buy it you can do this yourself and sell it to any gullible person who is into the lovely miss beyonce.
3,Decent review of American History,"We used this book for my AP US history class. It is a decent text, but it often focuses on off topic things such as the color of a president's eyes or the geneology of his wife. (And I mean for the not so important wives, not like JFK's.) Also, Garraty's obsession with Keneysian economics becomes apparent starting in chapter 20. It is a descent text, rather bland as most texts come, but it drove me nuts to read it as I began. His liberal standpoint is obvious if you overlook the extreme brevity of his coverage of the Trail of Tears and the lack of content based on slavery. (There is a lot but not as much as demanded on the AP US test.)"
2,I've had more stability with a $10 joystick,"The only redeeming parts of this joystick is that it has a rudder control built right into the stick itself and the joystick resistance knob underneath the base. The joystick is very unstable. In the ""Top Gun Fox 2 Pro properties"", you can see the red lines move up and down without you even touching the joystick. I'd rather keep using my old ""Thrustmaster Top Gun USB Version"" than this one with all the cooler features. The TTGUV is much tighter and has a lot more stability."
5,You have to love ham,"Most ham is the U.S. is barely edible. There are exceptional country hams put up in the South, but these are seldom available to the casual shopper. If you do love ham, you just have to try the Pure Bellota Iberian ham from Spain.Now what this book does is illustrate, educate, and sharpen you taste buds for the incredible delight of eating great ham. There are taste matches made by the Creator: Iberian Pure Bellota ham with an ice-cold glass of Fino Sherry is one of them."
5,All I wished for!,I got this as a present for myself remembering how much I loved it as a teenager. It was all I remembered and more! Fantastic fiction for teenagers and beyond. Even my husband liked it! The book was in really good condition for a second hand library book. I'm very happy!
4,Really great read,"I remember, when I was a teen, loving Margaret Mahy's books. This one and The Tricksters were my favorites. I could still go back to them today and love them. Mahy's a phenomenal writer. She really draws you into the characters' lives and makes you want to be them or help them as much as you can. In this book, The Changeover, a young girl must battle an evil sorcerer-type man who is sucking the soul of her young brother. The scariest thing about this book is how real it felt. It takes place in New Zealand or Australia (I forget, it's been a while), so the customs and local signposts are different, but the feel of fear for a sibling; or when one knows s/he's done something against one's parent's wishes... It's universal. It's a really great read."
5,An interesting book,"I love just about everything Lundwall produced. This book is no exception. The book is composed of the dedicatory prayers of all the temples up to the time of printing the book. Along with the prayers it includes brief histories of each temple of this deispensation and has some very interesting goodies. After the prayers and temple histories it moves on to discourses and excerpts from modern day prophets explaining the temple ordinances, spirits, encouters etc... and is very good. One of the reasons I like Lundwall so much is that he doesnt beat around the bush when it comes to things like that as many authors do. He quotes directly from the most profound source he can find and doesnt mince words.The prayers and histories can be somewhat repetetive but once you finish it the book goes from good to excelent. I would recomend this book to anyone who wants to learn a little about the temples. It is in no way an exhaustive history on any temple, but does get you started fairly well."
3,Not Bright Enough.,"I started with the 50mm 1.8 and f1.4. Then got this 28mm f2.8. Almost all of my night photos were blurry. 2.8 is just not bright enough. I was spoiled by my 1.8 and 1.4. Also, it seems kind of bad wide open, so you have to mostly use it in reasonable light, and stopped down. Not for night photos.Someone suggested 28mm for street photography, but I think they meant on full framed cameras. It's okay for street photos, but I'm thinking 24mm on DX might be better, especially with hyper focal distance and getting closer. Because on DX, 24mm is more like 36mm.And I would not recommend 28mm for portraits. There's a lot of face distortion. Fitting the whole person in the frame might be ok, especially with street work, but it's not really for close-ups of faces, unless you're aiming for the distorted look."
3,This item is NOT 'Like New',"I brought this item and it was described 'Like New'. When I got this item, I was a little bit disappointed. The appearance of this lens is a little bit old and the UV of this lens is not clean (and cannot be cleaned up). Also there's nick on the lens. The front and back lens also has dust. I think, from appearance, this should NOT be 'Like New', should be 'Acceptable'. Also, No box, No instruction papers.The good point is the function of this 'old' lens is OK. I didn't find something wrong so far."
5,"Extremely Sharp Lens, Well Built - Smooth/Damped Focusing","This is probably one of Nikons underappreciated lenses. For those looking for an affordable 28mm wide angle lens that is very sharp, this is it. It is well built (Made in Japan) with very good IQ."
3,"Good for DX format, okay for FX","DX side:I wanted a nice normal, prime, fast lens for my DX-format camera. This was a strong contender due to a 42mm effective focal length with 1.5x crop factor. Turned out to be a decent performer. Provides good color saturation and good FOV. Performs better outdoors.This lens lives on my Nion D70 now for the most part, but that's only because I have only one 50mm f/1.8 lens and I don't like changing out lenses too often.FX side:I figured I could use this with my film cameras as a wide angle for outdoor use. It works okay, but there's pronounced pincushion distorion at the edges of the frame through most apertures. I'm sure this can be corrected easily with Photoshop, but I prefer images to come out of the camera closer to the final product.Overall - okay for DX format, not good for FX format."
5,A GREAT MOVIE,I LOVED THIS ORIGINAL MOVIE AND ITS GREAT MUSIC. RUBEN BLADES AND DIRECTOR LEON ICHASO DESERVE HIGH PRAISEON SUCH A POIGNANT AND TRUE STORY.
1,Amatuerish film with wooden acting,"Yes, Salsa is very seductive but as a person who grew up in the culture, it is clear that neither Blades nor Ichaso have a grip on the reality. Buy it for the sake of having Blades entre film.But this film isn't even good enough for HBO."
3,consistently inconsistent...,"This is a pretty good item overall. The remote is a bit of a joke, and I also notice a clicking noise between tracks. Further, it sometimes cuts out for a split second when the rhythm of the music is too sharp. This was particularly bad for several Indian music tracks I have - it was so bad, I thought the tracks were skipping. However, when I listened to them with my headphones, they were fine. Also, I can't leave the ipod docked in the speaker for more than a couple hours or it just arbitrarily turns itself on - quite annoying when I'm trying to sleep and I am suddenly awoken by blaring guitars at 2:00 in the morning!Again, not bad for the price range, but if you can afford it, you're probably better off investing in something that will give you a bit more bang for your buck."
5,Fine sound and good quality for the price.,"Just brought this nice little system home and I'm very satisfied with it. The price was right and the sound quality is better than I expected. No, it's not like a concert hall, but for ordinary listening music sounds like it's coming from a much larger system. All the components work well and it's a nice design."
4,Excellent but...,"I recieved this as a Christmas present and it works very well with my iPod mini. The sound is crisp and clear,and it's amazing how loud it gets for such a little device. I am very satisfied with it in that sense, However: I am considering upgrading to an iPod Nano, and yes, the Nano is listed as a compatible iPod, but I am questioning this. The iBass requires plugging the ipod into it's dock and another cord through the headphone jack. But if the Nano's headphone jack is on the bottom, how can the iPod be docked and connected via headphone jack simaltaneously? Any suggestions?"
3,I want the original Vol. 2!,"I want the original Volume 2 from back in the day, before they redid all the volumes! There are still good songs on here but a lot of great songs are missing!"
2,Not so helpful for understanding the Ketamine Abuse and its treatment,This book should be one of a series and it contains many standard information. It is quite disappointing to read it after reading books like: Ketamine-Dreams and Realities or A Little Book on Ketamine.
2,As I Remember it..,"This comic book wasn't anything special. I read it in 2002 sometime soon after it came out. It's the simpsons.. its a comic book..... so? I'm a big fan of this show, and i don't regret buying it, but it's not like the show at all..."
5,I'd really recommend buying this book,"This an excellent book. I really like it. It helped me a lot to achieve my ccnp certification and at my job.Although it lacks some important details, for example, in STA and MLS, that makes me search a lot to find out some answers I had, it covers all the fundamentals necessary to configure switches properly and to do a great test.I like also the cd that comes with the book. First because I could print the exercises and write anything on the printed sheet, whithout writing on the book. Second, the test session is excellent and we have a lot of material."
4,Worth to buy,"This book is intensive (compared to sybex, I read that too) but easy to read.I did not give 5 stars because of two reasons:1)It includes ATM LANE and Token ring chapters which are not one of the exam topics mentioned in cisco's site (that means they are not included in the exam!) 2)I encountered many questions that I had no idea, never mentioned in the book (I knew every inch of that book, thats for sure)The latter made me uncomfortable during the exam. I thought I was going to fail. Well, not so high but I scored 901 (passing was 776). Thanks to this book.By the way, you should definitely use Clark/Hamilton book for switching. I had this one so I read it but this is just an alternative for Clark/Hamilton book. That one is the ""Bible"".Good luck on the exam,Can Zulaloglu"
5,A Wonderful Book,"Compared with CCNP Routing Certification Guide this book is a success. You can see careful writing, good organization and more importantly, clear and accurate description of the knowledge, all from hard work of the authors. Q & A part and attached CD-ROM are helpful too. This book reflects the high Cisco standard. This IS like a book from Cisco Press."
1,Worst stylus that looks good,Sent this back. The rubber tip wiggled so is very imprecise. Unusable. I prefer the Griffin or Rocketfisf brands. This model looks great and is slim and long but works very poorly
1,Aww!!,Didn't even have this stylus for a month and the tip tore already. I thought it would be a better stylus seeing as though 1 of this brand cost as much as 3pack of another brand.
2,Not sensitive enough,I bought this for the new iPad and discovered that you have to press pretty hard to get it to register. Bought the AmazonBasics one to replace it and that one works very well. Don't get this one.
3,So-so,"While I like the dimensions of the stylus, the clip came off the first time it was used. I'm not sure how I'm going to keep the stylus with my Kindle Touch.I'm writing this review on an iPad, with the (clipless) stylus. It works well."
2,Fair Stylus,"I ordered 2 of these for Christmas. My daughter's tip broke off already (less than 1 month). She is young and maybe a bit rough with it, but mine is showing wear already also. I love the size and thinness, but the tip needs to last longer for the price."
1,o.k. if you like musak meets elctronica,"I was very disappointed in this release. Rather than being a traditional tribute, it's more electronicly oriented than the other tributes out there which keep it to the traditional ""real"" instruments played. Drum machines and samples aside, the singers are terrible. They sound like lounge singers or somthing you'ld hear in an elevator. I'd give this a minus rating if I could. I've loved Deep Purple's music for over 15 years now, and it's because of my love of that band that I tend to be a bit harsher on other peoples versions of these great classic songs. My suggestion, save your money for the real deal, this is truly a waste."
4,"good quality, but not singles","i thought i was buying single lashes, but these are bunch of lashes in one piece. a bit longer than you expect, but definitely usable."
3,Difficult,It's probably not a bad product. Im giving it a neutral rating because its kind of a pain to put on and comes off quicker than the cluster eyelashes. Its C shaped so sometimes when the glue is drying the lash kinda tips and sets crooked.
4,Not too shabby!,"So i received a suggestion from Amazon.com to purchase this cd, and I did. Pretty impressed. The guitar playing is excellent and the band gives off a funky vibe."
3,Sad day for Liberty,The Rise of the Far-right is not a sad day for liberty but a sad day for people wanting to learn the truth. Mr Roxburgh follows the growth and rise of the far-right throughout europe and proceeds to explain in quite good detail each one of these parties. Unfortunately the problem is the biased look from Mr Roxburgh who seems to allow his biased to soak into each page of his book. He does not attempt to show any impartiality and to make it worse he even applauds the other parties who form coaltions to prevent the far-right parties from having any power within the administrations even though the people voted for them.
3,cheap switches,"I've used it less than a month and solely for MS Flight Simulator. I'm a 49 year old private pilot using it as a cheap way to get an intro to IFR so I'm not exactly beating it to death battling klingons. The hat switch and #4 button occaisionally stop working. I have to take the stick apart, fiddle with them a bit, and then they work. For a while. Of course I've tossed the box so no exchange here. I'll tolerate it for a while and buy something else.Next time I'll try the MS stuff or save a few bucks and get the quality I'm paying for."
3,good all round joystick,I got this joystick and my first impressions was yeah looks nice and i love the idea of a full size throttle. When i first got it being USB ther was no problems with delays so playing flight sims were no problem. I have had it for about a year now n the performance has decreased for the price I am considering getting another one. I have noticed that the joysticks wears very easily so after about 6-7 months of use it started to not turn properly. This might be because it was my first serious joystick and i was heavy handed but all round an excerlant joystick
1,Not a true documentary...,"...this production consists largely of home video footage shot with cell phones and camcorders, complete with running narration from the ""cameramen"" - mainly folks who ignored the evacuation orders and stayed behind to watch. Some of this commentary is interesting, but much of it is just inane.It is shocking to find National Geographic producing glop of this kind."
3,"Good read, terrible publishing","Let me start off by saying the book has very interesting information. However, the publishing part of it was very poor. There are grammatical errors, typos, missing spaces, etc. I am not sure if I got a preliminary version or what but it is just awful.The book does miss a key idea on the bunting chapter. It does not differentiate between sac bunts and bunts for base hits. Some of the information is a little redundant. I recommend ""Baseball Between the Numbers"" if you want to keep reading about interesting baseball stats.Also, the information on this book is a little outdated. It would be interesting to see ""The Book 2"" or something with more recent numbers"
5,Awesome book on baseball and statistics,"If you are a baseball junkie (check) and interested in data analysis (check) this is a GREAT book. The book walks you through the analysis of the game of baseball using various statistical methods and a recent dataset.The writing style is a little odd (but I got used to it), but the charts are fantastic and easy to understand. The material is broken down in such a way that it is very easy to follow the logic of the authors and examines each decision a manager would have to make when managing a baseball game. Lineup, steals, bunts, and streaks are all covered.A fun, fun book with a huge amount of insight into the game. Now I am second guessing my home team manager's line up. I could do it better, couldn't I????"
2,I Just Don't Get the Hype,"I've been devouring sabermetrics, at least of the mass variety, since I first started reading Bill James in the 80s. The Number 1 thing I learned from Bill is to ask useful questions, then define the parameters, then do the research and find the conclusions. While ""The Book"" is set up to appear to follow that thread, the questions are stilted, the parameters are (mostly) asinine, and so the conclusions - although the research is fabulously thorough - are fatuous and irrelevant. It has taken me weeks to slog my way through this book, because every time I pick it up the presumptions tick me off.The 2 stars are for the research. If there had only been the research without the silly conceit, I probably would have awarded 4 stars. The parameters of the research would still limit their usefulness. Save your money."
3,There are better G.H's out there,Thought I was getting the LP of same title.This is cheap hits comp that hits numbers but for that look for the Polydor releases 1&2.Chazz
2,Clumsy,"This is a very clumsy controller. Although it comes at a very appetizing price, the quality reflects that low price. The wing controls often get in the way because they are so thick and the buttons don't always respond well because there's too much space between the control board inside and where the buttons are. Got with teh Wingman Gamepad instead, it's a bit more expensive, but the quality is 100x better."
2,Not a compelling romance....,"Six of the seven sisters need husbands, although Lady Margaret, the youngest, is interested only in the pursuit of insects, not gentlemen, and certainly not the boring Captain Hawksby who has been assigned to keep her out of trouble in her brother's absence.Hawksby himself is more interested in the pursuit of a lovely actress, but is obligated to agree to the difficult task of keeping an eye on the rambunctious Maggie.Frankly, the romance seems to be missing from this tale. Hawksby (would anyone call him Bixworth?) is obsessed far too long with his divine mistress...I wonder if he would have given her up at all if she hadn't pre-empted him...and there doesn't seem to be a lot of romantic feeling coming from Maggie, either. I really can't blame her...Hawksby just doesn't make it as a romantic hero, and not just because of the mistress."
5,Another Great Read From Paula!,"""The Seventh Sister"" is a perfect example of what a Regency Romance should be. There's a strong heroine who knows her own mind and she doesn't fit into the sometimes silly Regency mold. Some would call her a ""bluestocking."" I call her delightful. Is it any wonder that her strong independence and winning ways end up capturing her gentleman's heart?A Season in London in Regency times contains lots of excitement. Paula Tanner Girard takes us there and provides all the color of the period. There's an authenticity to every scene -- you'll actually feel as if you're there -- and this delightful book is filled with romance, humor, and real emotion. If you want a glimpse of Regency life from an author who's given us many hours of enjoyable reading in the past, you simply have to read ""The Seventh Sister."""
2,L-E-T-D-O-W-N,"After Endorsed By You, i couldn't wait to get this CD, and when i got it was a huge dissapointment. It isn't even that it's just not up to the Gamit's standards, it's just a terrible album. Get Endorsed By You, or even This Is My Boomstick before you buy this. And then, if you really liked those two, still don't by this album."
5,Very informative,This book is loaded with useful I formation about SCWT. I bought it because I wanted to learn more about the breed and it definitely gave me an abundance of information from how to train SCWT puppies to grooming and more!
3,"Decent, but outdated","I had to purchase this book for a globalization issues of the twentieth century class, and this selection of articles was just okay. Many of the subjects discussed seem a bit outdated, so the relevance to the state of globalization in the twenty first century is missing. However, many of the articles are interesting, and the articles display a range of views and opinions on globalization."
2,Brush falls apart,Thought this brush was great when first got it but IT'S FALLING APART. The head plastic is actually cracking and the bristles are falling out. It's bad enough that toothbrushes go wimpy but to actually break? Ugh!
3,A purely synchronic presentation,"A SHORT GRAMMAR OF LITHUANIAN by Terje Mathiassen is exactly what its title suggests, a lightweight overview of the phonology, morphology, and syntax of Lithuanian. It is similar to an installment in Routledge's ""Essential Grammar"" line.Unfortunately, the grammar is nearly entirely synchronic. I would imagine that most people in need of a Lithuanian grammar, especially one published by Slavica, are Indo-Europeanists who are interested in the historical development of Lithuanian. While Mathiassen's grammar occasionally mentions IE topics, they are essentially footnotes. So, beware, if you are into comparative Indo-European linguistics, this will not serve your needs. The typesetting is also poor, but one comes to accept this from Slavica publications.As a simple grammar for students of the modern language, however, it is one of the few resources available. The presentation of the accent and ablaut is admirable"
2,Eh....I'm a little disappointed....,"As much as I hate to say it, I'm a little disappointed in the Juliana Theory's latest cd, ""Music From Another Room."" Granted, this is more of a collection of b-sides than anything, but that's still no excuse for it. I've really enjoyed ""Understand This is a Dream"" and ""Emotion is Dead"", but I just cannot seem to get into this EP at all. The opening tune seems to drag on and on, and really is quite annoying. The only song that I thoroughly enjoy from listen to listen is the EP's closer, ""Piano Song."" And even that song is not all that amazing. I just am not too pleased with the direction these guys are headed in, but that's just my opinion. I really expected a lot more from this, and perhaps that was my own mistake. I still love TJT and I'd recommend them to anyone, just not this particular cd."
4,eclectic but still awesome ...,"tjt are one of my favorite bands in the last few years and i still think ""understanding..."" and ""emotion..."" are better complete projects . but given that this is a collection of previously unreleased tracks -->its a great cd to get if youre into the band . and if youre curious too . why not? everything they write is worth hearing ."
3,"okay for a hamper or 2 shelves, but don't go for 3","one of the pics i saw of this item showed a stack 3 boxes high. that was how much storage i needed, and the item was on sale and free shipping, so i went for it. not long after i took it out of the box, the buyer's remorse set in. i have too many tshirts to fit in the dressers i have, and i had just recently moved, and was losing closet shelf space. i saw, i bought, i regret. i think the system would work well for a hamper, or when going on a trip where space was important, but when you got to where you're going, you have some room. good idea for a hamper, but not great for anything heavy (the lock system is good once you get the hang of it, but the way i had to set it up to get 3 rows was to remove a panel from each level, which makes it quite flimsy). the inginuity of the snap lock system is quite novel, but as we know, novelty wears off and now i wish i took my $40 and put it towards a real piece of furniture."
1,buying a pig in a poke,"This isn't the best of Jimi Hendrix and not even close. No adequate mastering or mixing on the 3 cd's, just a goofy compilation of recordings you won't find on a normal release for a good reason. If you like Jimi Hendrix then DON'T buy this one."
1,Don't bother,If you are a big Hendrix fan you will recognize this for what it is: a repackaging of the same old bootleg stuff that has been floating around for years. The first disc is mostly made up of the Royal Albert Hall concert. The other two discs are nothing more than some tracks Jimi may or may not have played on in the early to mid-60's. You've been warned...
3,OK,"When i first got this Cd, I did not know if it would be good or not. It was ok,but not great.Pros:lots of vocies,good lyrics. Cons:silly, not good after you listen to it a few times."
3,Is Okay,"I just got this single, I really actually just like the chorus part, to me its not as good as that first time that I heard it, but thats just me!"
3,"Good plotline, semi-bad acting","I had already heard this wasn't gonna be a good movie, but I gave it a chance.The storyline is VERY good, the main thing to watch the movie for and would teach teenagers some good views. BUT the actors aren't that great. It reminds me of the 80s-90s after school tv specials, but with this they took it a bit further by adding nudity and cursing.The main reason I even watched this film is because Marlon Jackson was in it. He did very good actually, but was a believable teenager.I think this would be good to show in school, but would need parent consent due to the one scene of nudity."
4,Studen Confidential,"Student ConfidentialNot a bad movie for the price. I enjoyed it, its not one of Tromas' best movies but its not a bad movie at all. I think this movie is a weird Troma movie because it is a serious movie. I do recommend it though."
5,Calling all Baby Boomers,"I have been an avid exerciser for 15 years, doing a lot of the Firm Videos. As I'm getting older, and my joints are getting more sensitive, I've been looking for a tape to get my heart rate up and really provide a good workout. This one is it! The Cardio is excellent and well cued and the balance and core work along with a little yoga thrown in is a great bonus. I can't recommend this tape strongly enough. Good going Petra!"
4,Respectable sweat,"This DVD is fun, a pretty decent workout (advanced beginner - intermediate) and a good time (40 mins) for days when you don't have an hour or so to spare. I really liked the trainer, though you need to know something of form yourself as she doesn't say much about it, and the workout is over before you know it. I didn't find it confusing, but then I work out to DVDs every day - I just enjoyed myself. I have to say, I have NO IDEA what the weights parts are doing there: they are far, far too short to do anything really except give more variety to the moves - which I guess is okay. I liked the 10 minute bonus DVD feature of a Baron Baptiste yoga workout too; of course, I know it's really an advert but it provides a nice stretch for after this workout. I'm English, and don't like the over-peppiness of some American programmes - this verges on the annoying but doesn't get there as Petra is really likeable. Recommended."
4,"Love Petra, like the video","I had a lot of Petra's VHS and just love her (Dance Step should be put on DVD, by the way). She is easy to follow, encouraging and positive, but not annoying. The program definitely gives you a good workout - and you can vary how intense you want to go. Although I am not an exercise fanatic (age 38, working mother) I would have liked more weight training. Overall, I like it."
2,inspirational story of the power of persisitence in black family,"the story was really interesting, just too long. It details a black family's struggle from poverty to medical professions. A really encouraging book for a young black girl. i did feel the father was too controlling, but everyone turned out wonderfully, so who am i to judge."
3,"An ugly, but good arcade shooter.","If you like the type of arcade shooters that fill the screen up with bullets and are impossibly hard, you'll probably like Mars Matrix a lot. I don't think it's quite on the level of the games made by Cave, like DoDonPachi, ESP, or Guwange, but it plays very smoothly. The graphics are more than a bit of a throwback though. The pixels seem big, and the special effects are unimpressive to say the least. Mars Matrix is fun, but it is not a cutting edge shooter. If you are into these types of games, you should have Ikaruga, Mars Matrix is a bit second rate."
5,Perfect Chamber Music,This is the ultimate in musicianship and exploring the emotion of French Music. Truly a joy to listen too.
2,Another useless book typical of this emerging genre . . .,"It is obvious that Brian has been doing a lot of reading over the past decade -- reading which has brought about a notable shift in his understanding of ""the church."" But that's just it: his vision for ""doing ministry in the postmodern matrix"" is an eclectic soup of strategies borrowed from almost every conceivable field of study making its way into the new century. His reading has incited a revolution in HIS mind . . . but he has failed to consult the most important source we have for truly revolutionary ideas:THE BIBLE.Brian never engages the Bible to see what it might say about ""doing ministry."" There is, therefore, no ""word from God"" here -- rendering the book ""weightless"" in terms of its ultimate trajectory. And not worth reading, really. All in all, it is another useless book which is, sadly, typical of this ""emerging genre"" of Christian books"
4,Tremendous cultural insight,"While much of McLaren's work has an aire of pluralism, his insight into culture and how the church should respond to it is tremendous. This book in particular is practical, accessable, and explores process rather than a cookie-cutter approach to how every church should look and act. Well worth reading for the contemporary church planter."
1,guitar for dummies,i ordered this book came with a broke cd and i cannot get amazon to do any thing about it
1,Guitar for Dummies,"I should have known better than ordering another worthless guitar instruction book. I have been trying to learn how to play the guitar for over 50 years now and I have yet to find an instruction book that tells you how really to play more than simple chords and strumming. I have stacks of such books that have not helped me at all. It seems to me that there in a conspiracy to try to keep people from learning what all the great guitar players know. Even the private instructors keep you taking lessons for years without really teaching you anything of value. When I learned to play wind instruments the lessons were concise and they followed a definate pattern to help you achieve a high level of ability. All the guitar books I've seen so far start somewhere in the middle and go nowhere. It is my firm belief that a person is born to be a real, all around, good guitar player and if he isn't there is very little anyone can do to teach you."
3,Not The Best...Not the Worst,"This book is great as an introduction, it teaches a couple of chords and basically describes techniques. If you want to learn how to read notes(a VERY important skill), you'll have to buy another book to practice. You'll also have to buy a guitar picture chord book b/c a truncated chart of chords in songs is all this book offers."
2,"Good introduction, not systemetic enough","Bought this book in a hope to learn as a complete dummy. It got me started, but that was about it. It gave me a good overview and a good introduction, but it does not have a systemetic approach so that I could go to the next stage. It probably jumps around too much. So I ended up going to a guitar teacher who started me from scratch. If you want to start from scratch, you might want to consider another book."
3,Guitar Basics,I thought the book was great but the CD was a little hard to listen to. It was hard to play with the CD because the background music was too over powering. If it was just the guitar strings being played it would have been a five star review.
2,Beginners Need More Than This Book To Start Playing Guitar,"This book is certainly not comprehensive enough for someone with no musical background to start playing - beginners WILL get stuck if they only rely on this book (starting from Part 1, Chapter 3). However, I would recommend using this book as a complement to guitar lessons from an instructor."
2,Not for the visual learner,"Well this must be a decent book, with all the praise it receives; however it didn't do much for me when I began playing guitar. I only had this to learn from, and I gave up guitar in frustration.I just got the ambition to try guitar again, but this time I bought eMedia Guitar Method computer software, and I've gotten farther in two days with that than I did the two weeks with Guitar for Dummies book.It seems they do have a Guitar for Dummies DVD out with instruction, that probably would be something you'd want to get in conjunction with this book to help you learn better.I believe that this book cannot stand on it's own as a good learning tool for the beginner."
5,It works!,"I got this book two weeks before Christmas and spent about an hour a day with it and my mom's guitar. Within a week, I knew enough to play a bunch of Christmas songs, and I felt confident and amazed with how fast I had learned. I had absolutely no previous experience playing the guitar, but this book made it easy and accessible. It works!"
2,Far from the best beginner's book - frustrating!,"I purchased this book hoping it would establish a sound foundation for guitar playing and lead the reader in a systematic organized method to learn the guitar. This book tries to cover way too much material. It really never goes into any depth on anything but instead glosses over the subject.It is disorganized and frustrating to use.I also purchased this book because it advertised learning how to play the guitar without needing to learn how to read music. Well, that's great but the songs are your worst nightmare from a '70's Mel Bay method book - ""Turkey In the Straw"", ""Aura Lee"", geez.This book is not a beginner's best choice."
1,Missing CD,Book was suppose to contain a CD which goes along with the instructions in the book. CD was missing from book.
2,Too Much Information,"Just got this today and started reading it, has a lot of information that really has nothing to do about actually playing a guitar, so right now I would say that this was a waste of my money. Also the disc that comes with it is a cd disc(audio only) I was looking for something more along the lines of a show and tell presentation. Personally if I had gone to a book store or library and visually inspected this book first, it would still be on their shelf."
3,Guitar for dummies,"youc ant learn a instrument overnight and need to have the time a patcince of a saint. I found this book good as i already have musical knoweleg for playing the paino for so many years - however if your a first timmer on the guitar it kinda goes straight from easy to intermidiate, be warned can get very very frustarting!"
5,guitar for dummies,"Thank you so much, book was in perfect condition and saved a lot of money. Excellent and will buy from you again."
5,Great Book for the Beginning Guitarist,This is a great book for beginning guitarists. I was a bit apprehensive about buying a guitar book from the Dummies series but boy was I wrong. I recently bought a guitar with the help of the book. I have also learned how to read tabs and play a couple of chords. The pictures show you exact finger positioning for each chord. This is a great book. My advice is to go check it out at a local bookstore and see if it is right for you.
3,Beware - electronic version over print,"Take note, the kindle version (and other electronic versions) don't include the CD you get with the print version. The CD makes the print version much more valuable. That being said, I give the book 4 stars. Also look for expanded book which includes other Dummies books related to the guitar for only a small increase in price (this expanded version not currently available in electronic format)."
3,good book but dont use it much,"this book is nice and I learned some stuff from it, but i really dont use it that much."
1,This book was not detailed enough,I learned nothing except the chords and differences between each guitar
2,should be simpler,"Well, the book is not bad and definately covers a wide range of topics. The thing is that I don't think that a person who never played a guitar before will end up knowing to play by reading this book. The book tends to touch on some basic notions and then immediately integrate these notions into music theories. So the person who has no prior knowledge is stuck. If you have some background in playing then this book should help you out. If you are just starting off then this book will probably be too much too soon. Better off looking for another simpler (and cheaper) book. If this is guitar for dummies then I must need guitar for light-bulbs."
3,A great refrence book,"Basically I use this as a refrence book, unfornately a lot of these books show the classical guitar style. For example, how to play mary had a little lamb and old mc donald. Aside from the cheesy old song the cd doesn't really sound like the song your playing. I've been playing for a while and the chords don't sound right. Although this book can tell you alot about guitars: how they work and history. It is long and boring in my opinion and is best used as a refrence book."
2,Not Worth Purchase Price,"This book is only useful if youve never even picked up a guitar. Ive only been playing for a year and it was too basic even for me and Im an absolute novice. I feel it should have covered theory a lot more than it did. Dont get me wrong, it has good info in there AT TIMES but as I said, absolute basic. You cant learn how to play a guitar by reading a book. But you can learn theory, warm up excersises (not even included) etc. I would not recommend this book to anyone that has ever played a guitar for longer than a week."
1,No cd or electronic music files w/ this version,"I am a beginner and need to hear what the music is supposed to sound like, the publisher has not bothered to include the music with the electronic version of this book, returned to amazon the next day and went down to my local bookstore to purchase a hard copy with cd!!"
3,how can I get the CD?,"I bought the kindle version, after reading the book, I found there should be CD for the book, but isn't included in Kindle version.It becomes difficult for me in many cases when reading the book without the CD.How can I get the CD??????"
4,More than I expected,"I'm a self-taught guitar player who's been playing for over 10 years. Unfortunately, all I've managed to teach myself is basic chords. This is the first book I've gotten my hands on that's showed me how to play basic scales and fake my way through some basic blues solos, etc. I also appreciated the equipment discussions. Though I skipped over a lot of the chapters that covered ground I already knew, I learned a fair amount from the rest of the book. Definitely better than those old Mel Bay books I used to have that made no sense whatsoever."
3,"A Good Start, But...","I concur with those who found the book useful, but not comprehensive enough. Its strengths lie in teaching how to strum early on, and how to use the basic patterns of different styles right away. I was certainly not bored, and some of the material (especially near the end, with the section on classical playing) is very challening. The CD is definitely a plus, and the ability to block out the accompaniment (by selecting a specific stereo channel) allows you to follow along and build playing strength. However, there is no chart of chords beyond those that are used in the songs, and the attempt at learning music notation is very meager. I used this book in conjunction with another. The other book used notation only, and I found that you can read time much easier with notation than with tablature (the latter being emphasized in this book). In short, the book gave me confidence that I could learn if I applied myself, but other manuals were necessary."
5,Classic!,"I can watch ALL of the season or skip right to my favorites! And now as an adult, I get the humor/jokes and laugh even harder then I did in the '80's!"
4,Not one of the best Three's Company,"Three's Company is my all time favorite show so I am collecting all the DVD's. They were weeding Chrissy out of these shows and only show her as making ""phone calls"" to Janet at the end of the shows. Although I love Jack and Janet, the show just wasn't the same without Chrissy. That said if you are a big time Three's Company fan then get this DVD. My opinion is season 2 is the best."
4,Love this show,I'm happy with my purchase. DVD's play fine. For the price and the timely matter of receiving this I would purchase from the buyer again.
2,Cheap.,"This is not a high quality, or medium quality flag. It's printed on nylon, which was expected, but the hems are poor and the printing is poor. There are stripes that are not straight and fuzzy printing lines. You get what you pay for."
3,Like a scarf,"This flag is okay, a printed fabric, not really as nice as other VF flags that I have owned... But okay for price. It's like a scarf really."
1,Obsolete!,I wonder where to use this lens with the new and better lens in 14-24mm F2.8.....this is an obsolete lens by my definition!
1,"less like terror, more like suspeeeeeennnnsse","Veronica Murray's father has died under suspicious circumstances and warns his daughter to leave New York and marry the Italian duke, Pietro, in order to stay safe.Veronica marries Pietro and inherits her father's jewelry empire, of which Pietro is in charge of the Italian branch. There are attempts on Veroncia's life --- who could it be? Veronica's relatives? Pietro's relatives? Pietro himself?This was a short book, but the suspense was long. Far from terror, I felt rather bored and barely finished the story to discover who the murderer was."
1,One word: No,"I recieved this product on X-mas '01. By May of 2002 all of the buttons except the 4 center buttons broke. Including both of the pedals, shifter, etc. Don't Waste your money on this cheaply made wheel. I am no longer buying Thrustmaster products. I would recomend a Microsoft Sidewinder or a wheel made by Logitech called MOMO. Also the pedals feel sloppy and they slide all over a carpet, which makes it very uncomfortable and hard to control... The NASCAR Pro Digital 2 is a horrible buy. I thought that NASCAR would put their name on a GOOD product, not this...thing. This might sound harsh, but I am a real race fan, and I know what a good wheel should be like, and it is not like this."
1,Terrible,"This is the only wheel i have ever used and it is terrible. The right shifter paddle and the gas pedal broke, so i returned it. A week after i got the new one, the paddle broke again. All i have to say is this is a terrible wheel, go with Logitech."
1,Hate it!,"I am not a full-time gamer, but if it takes hours to try to get a wheel to work...I don't want it. What's the deal with this wheel?"
3,"Decent wheel, but nothing outstanding","I recently purchased this wheel for my 12 year old nephew, and he is thoroughly delighted with the wheel. The only complaint I have is that by not being a force feedback design, it gives a totally dead feel for the user. It works great with the Need For Speed series of games, and also does well with the Sierra NASCAR Racing games."
2,local no-wave wannabes turned industry lapdogs,"this sucks slightly less than their older stuff but it also seems like a bizarre sellout move. this band used to be defined by their raw garageyness and they completely sucked at music, now they suck slightly less due to the production but sound like another brick in the interpol/bloc party wall. the best example i can give is if nirvana started sounding like creed. it sucks either way but these guys sound like they became puppets. a lot more professional, a little less interesting, equally uncatchy and insubstancial tunes"
1,Seeing cool reality through a crappy mirror ...,"This book is about two reconnaisance pilots who get shot down, then have to come to terms with their rustic desert surroundings -- and themselves.I consider myself well-read and open to a variety of genres. This book is the internal reflections of the two pilots. While you occasionally will read about the activities of the pilots, mostly you get a stream-of-thought that mixes their individual histories, fantasies, and a little reality.The best analogy would be buying a great DVD, but then instead of being able to watch it, you learn about what technically happens inside the DVD player as the cool DVD is playing. Sure, sometimes you might catch a glimpse of a cool activity. But most of the rest is unintelligible and meaningless.Another example -- one PARAGRAPH lasts 8 pages. Eight pages of run-on sentences in one paragraph.This is probably the worst book I've ever read. I don't blame the author -- I just can't believe a publisher would pay for it."
3,Silly light fiction,"Personally, I don't have much patience with Patty. I suppose it is good escapist fiction, but reading about such a spoiled, rich little flirt gives the feeling of eating too much candied fruit. Bilious. There are much more satisfying reads out there. Give me Edna Ferber anyday!"
2,Informative and Inspirational,"This book will delight both the angler and scientist. He talks about the ecology of streams, the setting, types of fish and the challenges facing rivers today. He also, in a series of Sketches, explores river lore. This book fosters an understanding and appreciation for rivers and is useful for high school biology students to postgraduates. An excellent book for those who love rivers."
4,Solid 4/5 title worth trying,"Just like the other reviewers, my son enjoyed this game a lot, but it doesn't have the long-term oomph of other top-rated titles. For the price, this is a good value and most kids will enjoy it, including the multiplay, but eventually grow tired of it and resell it for something else. My son (9) liked it quite a bit, so give it a try."
3,Fun but..,This game is fun except you have to mash a lot of you DS buttons and its hard to get combos that are critical for the game...Otherwise this is a nice game.
4,Good old times.,"When I saw this product on Amazon, I was thrilled. I loved the original Custom Robo on the Nintendo Gamecube, so I hoped maybe I could have the fun of my favorite Gamcube game on-the-go. Well, for the most part, I was not disappointed. The gameplay is just about as good as the original, with no added touch screen gimmicky bullcrap. The story mode story content is kinda lame (silly shenanigans at school LOL)and you being an irritatingly silent protagonist, but at least it's not like the original which was RIDDLED with infectiously UNLIKABLE and extremely MURDER-ABLE characters and occasional HORRIFICALLY DIFFICULT boss battles.Adding money and shops as well as repeatable battles for money and worthless experience points, whereas the original had you only do story battles is a nice change of pace.Regardless, both are fun and I personally was able to get a good deal on this product. I would recommend it to those who enjoyed--even if only slightly--the original Gamecube game."
5,Money well spent,"Despite some bad reviews for this game I am shocked that this game sells for just $12. Ive played alot of crappy ds games and this isnt one of them. In this game you get 3d battles with great customization. people lacking in skill wont be able to preform some of the simple combos and the story line isnt amazing but its definitely not bad in any way. great replay value with online and special battles after the story line is complete. the areas are sized well so that its not too small and dosent leave you stranded long. five stars for great gameplay, a side story where you battle criminals and instant fun when you want to jump right into fights."
5,Glad I Found it !!,"Well, my son played and loved this game when the Gamecube was all the rage. Sadly, the Gamecube died and my son has spoken to me often of the shameful beatings that he inflicted in this game on his siblings and cousins. We both spoke of great games that were just made for portables and Custom Robo came up. I could not begin to tell you how pleased I was at finding that, indeed, this fun little game had been imported to the DS format. Now I would really like to tell you that my son was thrilled receiving this gift, but I cannot as it is intended as part of a Xmas package. But I had a bit of fun with it, even my wife did. I think that the game is great and with the DS the two player capability is fantastic. I like this version of the game so much that I mentioned it to my ""little"" brother."
3,Custom robo arena,"Custom Robo ArenaThe weak story leads you by the hand, leaving no room for individual thought. If your looking for a game to mindlessly fight in, good this is for you."
5,FOR TURF HERDERS EVERYWHERE,"CAPTAIN SATURDAY is Bob Inman's most fully realized novel to date. A reader of his previous novels will recognize character types from past books. But CS does not rely on the intentions or attention of quirky southern personalities. Instead, at its heart is its protagonist, Will Bagget. CS becomes an outstanding study of a dynamic character. Along the way, the book touches on the themes of relationships, loyalty, and ethical choices.Inman tests his own nerve as a writer here, taking risks, layer-by-layer revealing the story, all the way to the bone. CAPTAIN SATURDAY captures emotional lightning and gives it back to the lucky reader."
1,THE WORST HUNTING GAME EVER MADE,THIS GAME HAS TO BE THE WORST HUNTING GAME EVER MADE. YOU CAN AIM RIGHT AT THE ANIMAL AND THE DAMN GAME SAYS YOU MISSED. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS STUPID GAME.
5,THE BEST GAME EVER!!!,THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER. This game is much better than battlezone 1 and more fun. If you want a VERY good game then get this game. This game is worth $35 not $10. This game is very fun on single player and multiplayer. Its alot more fun to play if you know the story (battlezone 1 is very important in the story). On single player you play on a side (ISDF) and later on in the missions you can choose to stay on the good guys side or to go to bad guys side. Multiplayer is REALLY fun. you can choose maps to play join games. Battlezone 2 on the internet is a chat room with ALOT of FUN. I play battlezone 2 any time I have the chance which is maybe 3 or 4 hours a day (because i go to school). NOTE: THIS IS THE BEST GAME IN THE UNIVERSE SO GET IT NOW!!! trust me.
4,Trip down memory lane,"I haven't played a game like this for years, the combination of genres was revolutionary back then, not that many games followed suite, but it was an epic experience non-the-less. I ordered this so I could relive those moments, the fun factor is still there, but the delivery and smoothness of games has evolved so much that it was far too noticeable to really immerse myself in this game like I did back in the day. Fun game, just don't expect to be wowed like when you were a kid."
5,This game is worth $50 not $10.,"I only have the demo and that only has the first three levels, but so far it os the BEST game i have ever played. I've been trying to get my parents to get the full game for me for a long time, but they want to wait till christmas."
3,Could Have Been Much Better..,"The first Battlezone is an amazingly fun game. That is high praise coming from me since I rarely play RTS type games. I love the resource management system and the user interface of the first game.So what happened to Battlezone 2? Those elements are still in this version but alot of the fun is missing. This game had very few thrills in it. The ability to call in airstrikes was fun, squad-based tank combat is always a good time but the game did'nt meet my expectations. Also, the 3D accellerated graphics in the game are wasted; it makes alot of things look fake or just plain goofy looking, especially the enemy vehicles.The developers were too quick to jump on the 3D bandwagon when they had no ""new"" game to sell. The first Battlezone is still better. My opinion: it is worth about 10 bucks, don't pay anymore and don't expect to be playing it for a long time."
2,A game that is not a game!,"...This game starts exciting at the beginning with aliensattacking your one and only military base, when suddenly you kill thealiens! But then, there aren't anymore enemies to kill. You'll bespending the whole time cruising about in your tank or spacecraftfiring missiles at trees or icebergs instead of the enemies!...Thisgame might be cool at the beginning but then will become veryuseless. As the people say, it's futile!"
5,I highly recommend this product!,"My family and I are avid drag racing fans and during the warm months we tailgate at the track practically every weekend. We do own an RV and we take it to the track whenever we go but who wants to be inside cooking when everyone else is outside having fun. I want the convenience of being able to cook outside the RV so that I can enjoy my family & friends instead of being stuck inside cooking. Only used it once since for 20 minutes but so far so good! I haven't had any problems at all and I am very, very pleased with this product. And with the cost being so affordable, I would highly recommend this product!"
5,Great customer service,"I purchased this as a gift for my husband for Christmas, I opened it when it arrived to inspect it. The stove works great but I ran into an issue with a latch on the case. After I post my review stating the case had latches that were defective Toolprice contacted me via e-mail asking if I would accept a new case shipped to me at their cost. I of course was more than happy to receive the new case which arrived yesterday and it is tip top condition. On top of sending a new case they refunded my shipping cost which they didn't have to do but I found to be a great juster on their part to make me a happy customer, and it worked. I would recommend this seller they are very fair in price and the customer service is top notch."
4,Camp stove,"GREAT addition to my camp gear . I am a master of campfire cooking & decided to convenience myself this year & now wonder why it took me so long . awesome bargain , great function , though did not handle low flame in any to no wind ."
1,NOT FOR INDOOR USE!!,"The Instruction Manual clearly states on the cover ""For indoor use in restaurants and for outdoor use as a campstove. NOT FOR HOUSEHOLD USE. CARBON MONOXIDE HAZARD. Never use this appliance in an enclosed space such as a camper, tent, car or home."" Since that is what I purchased it for I have to return it and find something else to use. Just a word of warning."
2,Buying a Cheap Product Will Come Back to Haunt You,"I purchased three of these portable butane stoves for an event I was catering. When I tried them out, one of the three did not light properly. I received a replacement, and all seemed well.At the event, I could not get two of the burners to work, and had to scramble to find at least one portable burner from a friend. During the event, the flames would shoot out of the unit, and at one point I burned my hand. Then the flame would get very low and did not keep the heat at a uniform temperature. I ended up returing a total of four of these units.I strongly recommend you spend more money and get a more reliable product. This is a cheap stove that will not go the distance."
3,Self-ignitor faulty,Buy the stove with the push-button ignitor. The self ignitor mechanism on this stove is a tab on the back of the knob. The plastic is not terribly strong and breaks off fairly easily. I have had this happen to two of my stoves so far. It is well worth pushing an ignitor button in order to have a more reliable stove.
1,Poor purchase,"We could never get this to light (directions say not to light it manually) and got absolutely no help from the distributor that Amazon referred us to. We went round in circles for far too much time to finally be told that it was made in China and they didn't have any information on it. They also clearly didn't care. We'll definitely stay away from anything like that. The stove seems like a good one, but not being able to light it wipes that out. It was quite a while before we needed to use it, so probably too late to return it by the time we tracked down any response."
5,Good compilation of essays on the process.,"The essays in this book, though some are better than others, are in totality useful in studying and understanding the election process during this crucial election year. I highly recommend it, not only for the political scientist (the primary targeted audience), but also for the layman interested in detailed but still very readable analyses of primaries, campaign financing and many other issues."
1,just Don't buy this book!,"I bought 3 vocabulary books for study during summer. Among those 3, this book has the worst quality. the words in this book are too old (1950s) Maybe my grand father found this book was useful in that days. But not now!. And the examples and explanations are so weak that these words don't make any chunk as they insist! Moreover, this book has unreasonable higher price than other vocablary books. the paper is so low quality . And the letters are too small to percieve. You might regret if you buy this low quality book. I recommend to buy ""1100 words you need to know"". That was really helpful."
1,Peels off after 15 minutes...,"We bought this border because of the other great reviews and liked the idea of sticking it up and being able to take it down later. We put the border up easy enough, but 15 minutes later, we walked into a jumbled mess on the floor. And to top it off, it sticks to itself better than it sticks to the wall. So when we attempted to peel it apart, it would rip.If you want to waste your money to try it out feel free, but I would suggest using an additional glue like wallpaper adhesive or something to keep it from peeling off."
1,Cars Border,"This border was even better than I expected! I decided to paint my son's room grey and this border brought out the blue hues in the paint and it looks awesome. It is very eyecatching, but not to busy. It blends very well with the bedding and other ""Disney Cars"" items in his room. This room remodel is his bday surprise! He is going to love it!"
4,Clear but now dated,"This book assumes little knowledge of C# and zero knowledge of .NET or remoting. It takes you through simple examples that you can build and run on a PC. (You will need Visual Studio.) I found this very helpful.Unfortunately the material is now a bit dated. .NET 4.0 and Visual Studio 2010 make some directions obsolete. Some methods used in the book are now deprecated.It would be a great help for beginners if the author, or someone else, updated this useful introduction."
5,Zombies + Typing = FUN!,"There's nothing like zombies coming at you to motivate your typing speed!!!Most of the reviews say it in here, but this game is a LOT of fun. Though it doesn't track your typing speed (WPM), it does test and tell you strengths and weaknesses, including accuracy, reaction time, and decision making. However, not only did it help me increase my typing accuracy, it most definitely increased my typing speed.I was pretty fast to begin with, but typing faster is always a plus. I timed myself prior to playing the game and clocked in at an average of 63 WPM. A week later (playing the game about 1 hour per day), I timed in at 74 WPM. Nice improvement! However, I needed a massage to work out the knots in my neck from stressing out about the incoming monsters! ;)I highly recommend this for anyone looking to improve their typing skills across the board.That's my two pence...Arial ;)"
4,Who knew zombies were educational?,"This is a great game especially for those of us who are video game challenged. I've never been great at video games, but I can type with the best. So when a friend introduced me to (read in your scary zombie voice) The Typing of the Dead I was blown away. Sure its not the most challenging game in the world and it could use a few more levels, but its great fun. As far as actually teaching you to type, well... that's debatable. See you don't have to hit the space bar or capitalize anything. But overall I love this game."
5,Best lens in the bag,I bought this lens for doing Wedding photography. I use it almost as much as my 80-200 zoom for Weddings. I also use it a lot for Church Directory photos and Seniors. It is a Great lens.
5,Photography student,Excellent lens! I really like this lens and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a new lens. I showed it to many of my photo teachers and friends and they love it too. This is a great piece of glass!
4,Nice bright lens and an affordable price,I haven't had a lot of time to use this lens but from what I have done it seems like a good lens. I bought it for its macro and it works well in macro. I have a lot of all purpose lenses and this has the potential to be one of my favorites.
1,Awful lens,"Spend your money an buy a better lens than this one. Was slow, unresponsive and I switch it out after taking 2 pictures at a wedding. You get what you pay for people."
5,Great All-Purpose Lens for FX DSLRs,"I bought this lens new about six months ago to use on my D3, and have used it now for four weddings.It is not quite as sharp as my 24-70mm f/2.8, when wide open, but when stopped down one stop, it is tach sharp. It is also much lighter which helps a lot at a long event, and it has more reach, making it great for parties and receptions.It autofocuses very quickly with the screw drive in the camera, and I never miss any action shots due to focus lag. It won't focus on some of the low-end Nikon DSLRs because they lack the drive screw.I don't recommend this lens for DX cameras, because 24mm is not usually wide enough on DX for many reception and party shots. In my opinion, the 16-85mm VR DX or even the 18-70 DX lens would be a better choice for a DX camera.The 24-85mm is also a very nice light weight travel lens for an FX camera."
5,BEST PROSUMER LENS OF THEM ALL,"I HAVE HAD THIS LENS ON MY NIKON D300 AND IT IS THE BEST ALL AROUND LENS THAT I'VE EVER USED IN 30 YEARS. YOU CAN JUST LEAVE IT ON THE CAMERA AS IT HANDLES MOST OF YOU PICTURES FROM CLOSE UP MACRO WORK (WITH A FLIP OF A SWITCH) TO FULL BODY PORTRAITS TO LANDSCAPES. I PERSONALLY THINK THE BUILD QUALITY IS EXCELLENT WITHOUT GOING OVERBOARD. AT 20 OUNCES IT'S LIGHT ENOUGH TO CARRY AND STRONG ENOUGH TO LAST FOR YEARS. IT LOOKS LIKE A PRO LENS AND IT WORKS LIKE A PRO LENS AT LESS THAN HALF THE PRICE. WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FROM A LENS THAN FAST FOCUS, TACK SHARP, GREAT LOOKING, EASY TO USE, WELL BUILT AND PROPERLY PRICED. I'VE HAD THEM ALL, 18-55 AFS VR, 28-70 F/3.5-4.5 D, 28-85 F/3.5-4.5, AND THE EXCELLENT 24-85 F3.5-4.5 AFS G, 35 F1.8, 50 F1.4, 60 AFS G F/2.8 AND THIS IS THE BEST PROSUMER LENS OF THEM ALL. STOP READING ABOUT IT AND START SHOOTING WITH IT. YOU'LL BE THRILLED WITH THE PICTURES!!!"
5,This Lens Performs As Anticipated,"This lens received mixed revews everywhere I checked. Having used Nikon products for the past 37 years, and owning three Nikon lenses for my D80, I ordered it. Beach Camera's service was excellent and the lens arrived in factory fresh condition. In the past month I have used this lens shooting several indoor events, both available light and with my SB-600, with excellent results. Its performance as a Macro lens is also outstanding. For those of you who want to take this lens to a lab to find fault, have at it! It works for me!"
4,Great all purpose lens,"I have used this lens for over 3000 photographs and it is sharp but...I use it on a Nikon D200 and the four auto focus sensors can cause much frustration--desired objects out of focus!-- when having to shoot moving objects, say in a parade especially under low light conditions. I am still thinking it is me so I continue to practice hoping to figure out which setting on the d200 to use. However, when the subject is not moving it works great. It is heavy but that is what you pay for to own a good quality lens. See Ken Rockwell's review for more technical aspects. I also concur that the lens hood, although it gives that pro look, does not seat well on the lens. Overall, I highly recommend it."
3,Sinatra and Elvis,"While I only rated this DVD a 3 out of 5 stars please recognize that this is only because of the relatively poor video quality. For any true fan of Sinatra, the Rat Pack or Elvis ownership of this DVD is a must. The commercials alone are worth the price of admission. It really is a hoot to watch Elvis flub his lines when singing the Sinatra hit ""Witchcraft""."
1,Superficial and useless for the real work,"This book tries to summarize too many arguments in once and the result is a completely useless book. Every argument is roughly touched and misses totally the problem solving part. Many chapters, like the one related to the C language or TCL, could be avoided in favour to a deeper report on other issues like networking installation. The book uses and abuses of the suggestion to read the HOWTO and the MAN pages, but this information is already available and free and we don't see the point to buy a book to receive this suggestion!"
1,Vague and superficial. Does not deserve your attention.,"Extremely generic, bases all the detail description referring to the HOWTO and the MAN pages. Do not worth neither one third of its price. By far better the Naba Barkakati book ""Red Hat Linux Secrets"" that, on the contrary, guides you into the details without loosing the overall concept. A last remark: don't write to the autors of Linux Unleashed, they will simply ignore your mail."
3,initially helpful but lacking in depth,"Combined with online HOWTOs and FAQs this book was helpful for installing and performing basic operations. However despite being over 1000 pages I was disappointed at the lack of depth and the amount of useless padding, e.g. chapters which could just be summarised to ""Perl is a language, you can do cool stuff with it, why not buy a book on it?"". Better to try to cover less stuff and do it in depth than provide lacking information on everything."
1,"If you know Linux DON'T BUY IT, otherwise DON'T BUY IT!","Poor book, really superficial and by far below the usual quality standards of the ""Unleashed"" serie. Almost completely useless if you want to do something more difficult than listing the directory content, the book makes a temptative to be a ""Bible"" of Linux but succedes only to be a BIG INDEX. Strangely a considerable part of the book is dedicated to the games that come with Linux! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY WITH IT!!! When an argument becomes more specific, the autor writes: look at the man pages, or look at the HOWTO, or ""because of the relative scarcity of INN and its suitability to larger networks only, we'll concentrate on nntpd""!!! So why don't you look at those info straight now and save your money? P.S. Don't write to the editor, your e-mail will be purely ignored."
2,"it' just doesn't cut it,","this is a decient book, but it pales to o'relly standereds, the book never really gets the point accrossbeing a hardened linux vetrian, I expected to find some original information in this book.. nothing it was a letdown"
3,This is good book for a very general introduction to Linux,"If you want to learn very little about many topic in Linux, then this is a good book. But if you want to learn about specific topics, don't even bother buying this book."
1,Not a good book at all.,"I don't suppose you really need another review telling you that this is NOT a good book. It tries to cover everything, and ends up covering nothing. Please do not repeat my mistake! Buy something else (I wish I knew what though...)"
3,"Poorly thought out organization, but still useful","Do not order this book if you are looking for Red Hat 5.2. Although I have seen this book for sale in bookstores with 5.2, this book comes with 5.1. Also, don't assume that the book refers to the version on the cd-rom. Many of the examples and information do NOT apply to Red Hat 5.1. I have (unfortunately) found myself going to the HOW-TO's to figure out what the book was trying to explain. The book is a good source of basic info, even though it (unbelievably) doesn't contain a section on SAMBA."
3,Great book but bundled software was useless,"Like the title says, the book is great with plenty of insights and is fairly easy to navigate when you're looking for something specific. However it comes bundled with Red Hat 5.1 which, in and of itself, is fine but most of the commands that the book mentions don't work with Red Hat! I found that when I obtained a copy of Slackware 3.6 that the book was an excellent resource. Red Hat's version of Linux is so proprietary that I don't understand why they (the publisher) shipped it with this book. The book would easily have a 4 star rating but since part of the reason I bought it was to get a copy of Linux, I'd have to give it a 3."
2,Not for the beginner!!!,"This book is for the more experienced user of Unix or Linux. The installation chapter was very generic, and to the beginner, was just not in depth enough. Also, the book does not explain things so that the beginner will understand very well. This would be a good reference book though for someone who knows a little about Linux or Unix. For a good installation book of Linux, for Linux 4.2, I do recommend ""Discover Linux"". It is step by step and easy to understand."
2,A large book with alot of substance,"i am new to linux and figured a book of over 1000 pages would have alot more depth. I found i cound find out the very basics but not much more. Example: i could not find out how to mount a cdrom to read the cd included. It seems to say you can do this, this and this with linux but when i said yeah this is really neat now how do you do that i found very minimal explanation."
3,Fair.,"This book can be used in addition to the HOWTO/mini HOWTO.But I would stick with the Linux Documentation Project or those HOWTO first before consulting this book.This book does gives many instructions on how to do this and that, but I would say at least 50% of the stuff you can find it in the HOWTOs or the Net, so unless you have some extra money to spend, save it for something else.If you want to learn Linux, I think the best way is to go to web and find what you need"
5,A must read as a linux reference.,"This book is ragged and torn from the not constant pawing it has recieved, rather it is the urgency with which it has been pawed. This book has never failed me in last minute refernces. It does not treat each topic in depth but often it bridges the gap between getting started on a new topic or being frustrated by a specialized text written for peers and not learners. This book will get you going, and the direction you take from it will be your own chioce, but with a solid foundation. Get this book if you want to learn Linux"
1,Crummy Book!,"As was said by others reviewing this book, it is a waste of money. You get Red Hat 5.1 but the book basically talks about Slackware. The author apparently was not informed that Sams was including the Red Hat cds.A better book is Red Hat Linux Unleashed by David Pitts, et al... It contains Red Hat 5.2 and even talks about it...."
3,"not too useful, don't bother","the book is very superficial and won't help if you run into any problems, that is why i dont recommend it to even novices."
2,Just a generic overview of Linux,"The only good thing about this book is that it comes with Linux. It provides only a general overview of Linux and a cursory section on setting it up. There's no troubleshooting hints or tips. Pretty lame for beginners, not enough for experienced users. It doesn't even have a section for Samba."
2,Prayer?,"If you do not want to be insired in prayer. If all you are looking for is pure theology on prayer without help in your own prayer life, than buy this book. It was a total bore. I only got half through and had to put it down."
4,A good example of Erte's work.,"With this book you get a glimpse into the master's mind at the birth of Art Deco and beyond. Erte's designs flourished in the mid-20's, when the Deco age was new, but you can still sense a taste for the noveau and baroque ages in his art and gorgeous designs. Erte was a pioneer artist untill his death and anyone seeking to learn true fashion design will benefit from the vision of Erte."
2,"This lens is ""OK""","The quality of the lens is pretty good. Image is clear and sharp.One thing I don't like the lens is the ""focusing""... it take long time to focus on the image and the motor is noisy. Sometime the ""image"" is lost and will go back and forth to get the image focus. I have set it correctly on the lens (for those of you who own the lens, you know what I am talking about).After using it for a few years, I had to sell it on Ebay and take a lost.I am now using the new Nikon 70-210/2.8 which is much nicer/faster focus (but cost slightly more)."
5,Great lens,I love the lens. It's very sharp. The construction is strong and solid. I orders from amazon.Because it was the best Price I could find. Very happy with the purchase.
2,Glasser again,Yes I bought all of Glasser's books so I could learn about his theories and their results. I think Reality Therapy is a good thing ... especially when working with minimal issues in brief therapy.
5,Very Cute and Fun,"This is another one of my favorite Melissa and Doug products. I bought this after I bought there picnic basket which is also plush. That was so cute I decided to buy a set for my mom's house and came across this one. My 10 month old daughter loves this. The ""candy"" does different things.The candies wrinkle and the lollipop is like a rattle. Her favorite is the lollipop and gingerbread man(just soft).I also love these products because they are so durable. These are washable to. That is always a plus."
3,Okay...,"The light is okay. First of all, it is very heavy and just barely holds in the USB port. Secondly, it is very weak and will come out of shape easily, and sink into a position that is in your way.Lack of an on/off switch does not bother me, but it would have been nice, I suppose. Other similar lights have an on/off switch.I recommend one made by belkin that clips onto the top of the screen, and has a coiled wire that stretches pretty far. It won't come out of position."
4,Good product,"Just got it today. Its bright, and doesnt run hot. The holder is a little weak... which makes it want to droop, but all in all its a good light"
3,Sophomore Jinx,"The initial Mizell release, Blacks and Blues, was a very strong effort that I rate at five stars. This release, Satin Doll, is not nearly as strong. It sounds like the Mizell brothers were running out of ideas after all of the Donald Byrd albums and Blacks and Blues.Satin Doll is a cover that is barely passable. My Little Girl, Rain Again and You are the Sunshine of my life are truly forgettable. The other cuts are OK listening. I owned this album on vinyl and it became forgettable really fast. If you buy this, don't get the whole album. Just buy the nice cuts on MP3 only.Fancy Dancer is worse than this offering."
3,Nikon SD-8a battery,Provides faster recycle times and longer flash life without need of changing batteries. I shoot weddings - the key with the SD-8A is catching more shots without the longer recycle period. I have had a flash shut down because it got too hot - SB800. It did not blow out the flash - other battery packs could blow out your flash - but not the SD-8A.
1,This Game is CRAP!,"This game is total crap. Think twice before you buy this. It is one of the worse games ever made. Trust me. The game is barely playable. The AI in the game is horrible. Your team mates are not helpful at all. Most of the time your team gets stuck to the wall. I bought this game and please learn from my mistakes. It doesn't even deserve the 1 star, but I can't submit it with out one."
1,this game is horrible,"I actually never got it but i thought about getting it. The first time i ever saw this abdomination was at one of my friends houses, he got it from his parents. He had to instal it a total of 3 times, so he had three copies of it. The first time we started the game half of the people on all the times went strait in to a corner of the battelfield, and most of the gun fire came from the guys facing the corner so you could see the paintballs coming from either the top of their head or thier back. If you dont belive me you can probably find a demo of this game to download."
2,Wouldn't buy again.,"This game was kinda fun, but there were too many glitches. The worst part is is that it is TOO EASY. I buy all my players the cheapest guns and I can still win the entire season mode buy myself, the other players don't do anything and move too slowly so I am always by myself. In two different fields, every player from the other team comes out of the same passasge. It is like shooting fish in a barrel. I wouldn't buy it again."
2,Awful Game...GREAT MUSIC!,"I don't care what anyone says. The Music in this game is amazing. Vivaldi's Spring with 4 electric guitars?!?!? How could you not like this??? If any of you know anything about music then you would know that this is good. Now the game is terrible. No doubt about that. Guns suck, Artificial Retardation. Maps worst ever. Very easy. BUT the music makes it all worth it. When I find out who arranged this I can die happy."
2,"Well, the Price is right...","Graphics are horrible, sound makes me want to remove my sound card, music is like Euro-Tecno-Pop on meth, and the AI is laughable. I never bought this game, but have played it many times at friends' houses just to laugh at the computer players runing into walls and such. People who are thinking, ""It's DOS, what the heck did you expect?"" have no idea what they are dealing with. The only reason I can give this an overall rating of 2 stars is because the price of $0.29 makes is worthwhile to buy just for those fun air pillows that come in the packaging."
1,Extreme PaitBrawl,"Terrible did not work at all. Major glitch, that would not install with the auto-install. Once I got it installed it was trying to run out of Ms-Dos. I would save my money and by PaintBrawl 2."
5,Extreme Paintbrawl!,"This game rules! If you want a true paintball experience, get PaintBrawl! Great graphics, awsome weapons(eight to choose from), HUGE battlefeilds(five to choose from), and lots 'o fun!"
5,WOO HOO!,"SUPERB!! Every song on here is a treasure trove of hidden subtleties and artsy bliss. Starts off with the most amazing opener ever...pattern recognition. If you've liked the latest sonic youth releases(especially A Thousand Leaves), then this is absolutely essential, my friends. Just amazing..."
4,Peace prevails,"Thumbing through the reviews here is interesting, as we see comparisons between Sonic Nurse and Goo, Dirty, Daydream Nation, Evol, Murray Street, NYC Ghosts & Flowers, the early work from the 1980's ... pretty much the band's entire oeuvre. And I agree, it bears favorable comparison with all of the above and more.Whether this is SY's ""best album ever"" is another matter, and ultimately a trivial one. This record should attract more listeners and inspire interest in their previous work, and surely that's praise enough.What stands out is how the band has truly collaborated here in a way they have not always done. It's hard to hear the lines between the ""Kim songs,"" the ""Thurston songs,"" the ""Lee songs."" This is more blended, more -- dare I say the word -- mature effort.Yes, it's a little bit languid in parts, but how long can we reasonably expect the band to keep rocking out like they're 20?This is a great album for SY fans, and a good starting point for newcomers."
3,"Worthy, if predictable summation of largely influential noise-rock band","3 1/2As proven with one of their most solid singles to date (Unmade Bed), Sonic Youth continued their late career refinement with this virtual compilation and culmination of the many sounds we have seen this band evolve through ever since the mid 80's. Most of these songs do not break much new ground, but the entire album flows solidly nonetheless. Even Kim Gordon's obligatory horse-vocaled contributions (often entirely too self-consciously ugly for her own good) work well in the context of this easily digestible compendium."
4,Still relevant,"The Sonic not-so-Youth are still relevant. ""Mature"" isn't the right word, as they hit the ground running eons ago; ""refined"" is more accurate here. With the exception of ""Kim Gordon and the Arthur Doyle Hand Cream,"" this album is even and mid-tempo, with the usual SY signatures: alternate tunings, controlled feedback, the occasional tribal tattoo. Some of the earlier cuts, particularly the gorgeous ""Unmade Bed,"" bear a curious resemblance to Neil Young (or is it Neil Young that sounds like Sonic Youth?) Kim Gordon's mewling on the aforementioned clunker would have been more appropriate on earlier albums. But Sonic Youth aren't about teenage riots anymore. Here they're just being themselves, and that's a good thing."
4,A great return for Sonic Youth,"Ill start of this review by saying that album is really good and easily is one of sonic youths top 5 or 6 albums. It features many great songs such as unmade bed, dripping dream, stones, new hampshire (my home state!), paper cup exit, and peace attack. They are all filled with sonic youths signature trademark meaning they are wierd, quirky (in a good way)and feature layers of feedback and often go off on long and great instrumental jams. A big question i have been hearing is that it is as good as Murray Street. I would say no cuz all of kim gordons songs suck (like ussuall) and Murray street only features two of her songs where there is about 5 on here. Well all in all this is a good album and worth its purchase"
1,This disc MIGHT NOT PLAY in your CD player,"This disc is a corrupted, or copy-protected, disc and does not play in many CD players. Meaning: it doesn't meet the (Red Book) standards of a CD. Don't buy it and don't support Universal, who uses hard-working, paying consumers to test what copy-protection method works and what doesn't.I also heard this album is rather formulatic."
2,sorry--tarnishing the legacy,"everyone, it seems, agrees that Daydream Nation is the pinnacle of what Sonic Youth can do--that was more than 15 years ago. Murray Street, NYC Ghosts and Flowers, Experimental Jet Set--these are the nadirs: absolutely worthless exercises ispastiche/collage guitarscapes/ ""Poetry""...there are 2 good songsthat remind one of the early Youth (if you don't know EVOL or Sister--get them!): ""peace attack"" and ""new Hampshire"" the rest of this, after 3 listens, is, i think, cack!!! avoid. a waste of money. i was ripped off! come to think of it, i am pretty peeved! happy i bought some good records this week: BLACK WATCH, ""the innercity garden EP,"" and BLOC PARTY (well, it's ok)..."
2,I WANT MY MONEY BACK,"SONIC NURSE LIKE THE LAST TWO PREVIOUS ALBUMS SUCK. WHAT HAPPENED TO SONIC YOUTH.I WILL NO LONGER BUY ANY OF THERE NEW MATERIAL. THEY SOUND OUT OF ENERGY. WHERE'S THE EDGE, IT'S BORING."
1,Huh?,"Jee-zus. I am having the strongest ""Emperor's New Clothes"" experience here. I borrowed a copy of ""Sonic Nurse"" -- I'd heard of the band and I was curious as to what they sounded like. Apparently fan loyalty trumps aesthetics again. These guys work in unpleasantness the way Thomas Kincaid works in paint. God, what a pointless exercise. Thumbs down."
5,"Enchanting, beautiful, soulful",Zafa's voice is absolutely beautiful and the music is soulful and danceable! If you love world music you will love this! I highly reccommend this CD!Sarai
5,Easy and Fast Read.,This book is no-nonsense and is very motivational. I picked this book up on a whim and got through it in one evening. It was a very fast read and made a lot of sense. The author seems to be a person that actually gets the whole picture on fitness. America needs to listen to this guy because it's not about Atkins or Dr. Phil....it's about common sense!
4,my favorite prize for students,"Grandpa Po's Originals are my students' favorite prize for the classroom. Our school district has banned junk food for incentives for kids so Grandpa Po's is a perfect fit. The kids get a bag when they complete all of their assignments for the month. They love the snack and they work hard to get all their work done. Their parents love the reward too and many students come back to buy more to take home to the family. Thanks, Grandpa Po for your ""better than food"" snack!"
1,Buyer beware!!,"Everyone should be aware that this album is just an import version of Accepted Eclectic with the exact same track listing. It doesn't even have any remixes. It's still a great album, but don't get this one, its just more expensive."
5,The Best Rapper You've Never Heard,"Rap has been riding the themes of sex, alcohol, and marijuanna a bit hard lately and Aceyalone provides a ready antidote for what's ailing the intellectual hip-hop fan. Steering clear of proclaiming his bank balance or choice of beverage, this master lyricist pieces together one of the finest hip hop albums of the past 5 years. From Golden Mic to I Never Knew, Aceyalone covers the spectrum of life, speaking on everything from the growth and maturation process to the role music has played in his life. Innovative beats from master DJ Fat Jack lay the groundwork for Acey to spit some of the wittiest rap lyrics in years. Aceyalone is not hung up on his background, his peeps, his jewlery, or his women. He's hung up on making great great rap music."
3,Aceyalone - Accepted Eclectic,"As my first taste of Aceyalone, I have to say that Accepted Eclectic did impress me. However, I doubt that Ace-One would be one of the greatest rappers out there. If you're looking for the next level, try listening to MC Common. While I won't deny that Ace-1's beats and instrument usage adds a dimension SORELY missing from most hiphop albums, I find his lyrics missing the wordplay of a Talib Kweli, Mos Def, or a Common: That is, he's missing that playful sensibility, and despite some of the smiles that AE gave me, it becomes harder and harder to listen to repeatedly. So, in conclusion, I think Ace-1 is a good introduction to the non-mainstream rap, but it's a stepping stone. Try listening to Common, or Mos Def, or even Talib Kweli once this album becomes boring."
5,This is Tight!,"Aceyalone tears it up on this album. His beats are phat, and his flows are too smooth to even describe"
3,Rappers Rappers Rappers,"Dissing ""Hello Kitty Rappers"" and bragging that he's ""cursin' like a sailor with a bottle fulla Jagermeister,"" he makes up with his mouth what he lacks in street cred. He's old school in that his samples are scratchy and offbeat (y'know, classical strings, woodwinds, noize) and his many boasts concern mc skills, not trouser bulge. So, sixteen solid tracks, no stinkers, well done. But nothing sticks out, either - no obvious selection for a mix tape. Rather than play the fool a la Del the Funky Homosapian, he takes the safer route and remains rigid, uptight, kind of banal. In other words, the album's not much fun. But it's still morally (even aesthetically?) preferable to any thug anthem currently booming fron yonder frat house or SUV."
2,Don't bother with this one,"I've been a huge fan of the Bad Brains/Soul Brains for almost 20 years. I saw them on the reunion tour in Montreal, and they were really uninspired. This CD, recorded in San Francisco, is sadly, just as mediocre as that Montreal show.The mix is a little tinny, and the liner notes don't even have all the facts straight.The playing is brilliant, but HR really sounds bored. If you want some powerful Brains tunes, check out ""The Youth Are Getting Restless"" on Caroline, or even ""Live"" on SST Records. This ""Live at Maritime Hall"" is pretty mediocre in comparison to their other live albums."
3,Good for fans but not so great overall,"I love love love love love this band. Can't get enough of them so I'll always buy whatever they have for sale. But I am not sure what's going on with HR. Part of his style was a very aggressive, frantic sound which he has abandoned. A lot of the songs on the CD don't sound so great without that. Although this has nothing to do with this record, he also stands motionless during the performances - another shift from the days of stage diving and leaping around.The mix is not great but not terrible. The band sounds excellent! I wish there was more music from ""Quickness."" ""Soul Craft"" doesn't have the same feel as it did on the record, where Mackie replaced Earl. But on ""Re-ignition,"" Earl sounds killing! Especially on the bridge. He kills that sh#t! Generally, the ""I Against I"" material sounds the best, I think.This wouldn't make a very good introduction to the group but if you are a fanatic like me, it's worth it."
4,Take it easy on the Brains!!,"I think the reunion concert on this cd started off slow but they got going pretty good after about the 5th tract. I read that people are complaining about HR and the band but can u imagine how much HR can only punch out now at his age,the decibels coming outta his throat all these years,the drugs,the arrests,the fights and everyone expects him to sing like he did on the "" Lightning Striking the White House"" cd as sum have put it.I thought the album was good despite the fact that these guys have been around for a couple of decades and they also have influenced alotta other bands....Take it easy on the Brains!!"
2,"taste good, but in pieces","I would recommend you buy these cookies from the store, not from this site. Only one cookie wasn't in a bunch of pieces. They taste good, but they didn't ship them well. I sent an e-mail to see what Amazon could do about it, but never got a response. They're yummy, but buy them at the store unless you don't mind eating crumbs."
3,"Arrived out of date, but Amazon refunded the price","Some of the cookies were broken (not a big deal to me), they still tasted marvelous.However, after I ate one I realized they were out of date by 3 weeks.I called Amazon and they refunded my purchase price.I think Amazon has great customer service.There was no way Amazon could have known the sell by date, as the cookies were sealed in a Wild Oats box."
3,Iggy Pop - 'Live In NYC' (King Biscuit Flower Hour),"'Live In NYC' was recorded at the Ritz in November, 1986. Not as good as his 'King Biscuit' CD from Boston's The Channel (see my review). Overall, this is 'okay' for a live release.T he sound mix is a bit too tame for me, however Iggy's vocals are fine. Counted just three Stooges (no pun intended) tunes here, ""I Got A Right"", ""Gimme Danger"" and the bonus track ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"". Other worthy tracks are the full throttle rocker ""Real Wild Child"", ""Sister Midnight"", ""Lust For Life"", ""Night Clubbing"" and the Igster's classic / anthem ""Five Foot One"". Check it out."
5,Amazing guide and resource,"This is one of the best guides for structuring guided reading group lessons. The structure incorporates all of the different aspects of literacy; Vocabulary, Fluency, Phonics, Phonemic Awareness, and Comprehension in a way that ties it all together. The best part is the predictable pattern, my students thrive off of it."
5,Primer on the ACW in the Southwest US,"This was the second book I had found on the American Civil War in the Southwest United States. I wish I had discovered it when I was in grade school when it was originally published, and I lived in Albuquerque.Of the various books I own on the subject, I recommend this one as the most concise over-view of the little discussed battles in Arizona and New Mexico. While not the easiest read, it is the best of its weight.He covers not just the actions against the Confederates, but also against the American Indians who took advantage of the displaced regular army units pulled back east to cause some havoc. This book covers the major battles, and touches on the associated skirmishes. It does not delve into too many of the personalities and their reasons, but it does address a number of them. Nor does it cover the variety of ethnic issues that were present in this campaign."
5,good book,"I used this book to write a paper for a Civil War class. I only got a B-, but that was no fault of the book. It contained excellent detail, and was a great tool to me as i worked on this history paper. I would def recommend to anyone interested in that chapter of the civil war."
5,Very clear explanation,"I came from Indonesia, ""tempeh country"". For me tempeh is my food, I ate since maybe I could eat solid food. Very common, people never thought how to make tempeh. You always can buy anytime and cheap. When I moved to America, I didn't find tempeh like I always ate and fresh..with the smell so nostalgic. My husband found in library THE BOOK OF TEMPEH (same author)and I learned how to make tempeh from that book. I did...then now, I confident enough to say, my tempeh is really good. Because all my friends in here says...my tempeh different and taste better. Thanks Bill !!!!!So, we have plan...in our retire live in Mainland (maybe countryside PA) we will make tempeh company. I bought this book and my husband said, very clear the explanation about machine, room, etc.Recommended if you want to make your tempeh store."
2,Don't Be Shortchanged By This Book!,"The first edition of this book is a hardcover with 245 pages. The words ""Professional Edition"" are on the front of the dustjacket. This second (paperback) edition has 64 pages missing from the first edition, specifically, Appendixes C through H. While much useful information has been deleted, nothing new has been added. New editions should improve on old editions, not detract from them. I suppose the publisher wanted to make a higher profit on the sale of this book by printing fewer pages per book. Seek out the first, hardcover editionThe book of tempehif you want the whole (Tempeh) enchilada."
5,i love this classic game.,"Really enjoyed this classic FPS. Hardcore gamers wont be disappointed. i highly recommend purchasing. Graphics are great, story-line is solid (and not so short) , audio is excellent and the price is right."
1,Awful book,"This was probably the worst Bette Davis book I've ever read. Every man in it comes off as either a womanizer or gay; and I feel the author spent WAY too much time exploring the sexuality of other men in Hollywood. Really, does Clark Gable's or Tyrone Power's sexuality have ANYTHING to do with Bette Davis? Mr. Quirk comes off as obsessed with who is or isn't gay in Hollywood, and the men in Bette's life's sexual habits than he is in Ms. Davis. This book was truly awful. Giving it 1 star because there are no negative star ratings."
1,Pass on this one,"This book is not for the serious beer cook. A typical ingredient is ""1 can beer"". Real beer has styles and rarely comes in a can. Need I say more?Walk, no run, away from this one."
5,What you are looking through,The apperature opens about the size of a silver dolar.This is another lens that I bought to substitute the 18-70mm lens that I had for a year. For about the same price you can ditch the 18-70mm middle of the road lens and pick up the 50mm 1.4/f and this 85mm 1.8/f. It will make you happy.This lens is ideal for portraiture for two main reasons. Its focal length and its apperature. The focal length not only gets rid of distortion but also allows you to get a nice portrait without being right up in the person's face. The apperature allows you to get a shallow enough depth of field (how far is in focus) that background distractions are blurred out. It also allows you to shoot in low light conditions.All around a great lens.
5,Great Nikon prime lens!,"The 85mm f1.8 AF-D lens is a great choice for Nikon dSLR users looking for a good portrait lens, and a much cheaper alternative to the f1.4 AFD.Construction quality is top notch and comes with a screw-on metal petal hood, unlike most other lenses coming with a plastic hood. Since it is screw on, I found I've left the hood on all the time.Being an older AF-D lens, you won't get AF with newer low-end Nikon dSLRs that lack a built-in AF motor, so if you want AF action, then avoid using with cameras like the D40/60/3000/3100/5000. Older or newer high end SLRs with the screw drive motor, you're all set. AF is fast and responsive, if slightly noisyImage quality is great on this lens with a nice smooth bokeh when shot wide open. I haven't noticed any significant distortion or excess softening in the corners.A great choice of prime lens to add to your shooting armamentum and a nice change from the usual 35 or 50mm lengths most people use."
2,Not that good,Lens is not that much good in quality.I mean to say it is good but the condition of the lens is not good as I bought it as used.I am looking to resale it.. and go for a new one.
1,not even close to description,Item description was fabrication from stock photo used(not product being sold)and actual condition of product not even close to what was shipped to me. May the buyer beware.Nikon 85mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras
5,Great Lens,"I like to use prime lenses at times, and this is perfect for portraits when used for film or digital cameras. The sharpness is great and I enjoy using it at large apertures which puts the background nicely out of focus. The auto-focus works well and rapidly. The cost is less than the 85mm 1.4 lens which would be my second choice. I find that I use this more and more instead of the heavy 80-200mm 2.8 lens."
1,I have seen everything now,"Two things pop into my mind when I read this book. 1) Since when did dogs care about feng shui? and 2) People who buy this book either buy it for a laugh (like me) or because they are nuttier then shirley maclaine. I would like to say this book was done in good humor...unfortunately the tone is serious...the author wants us dog owners to know that dogs want feng shui...after all, the owner's dog is the primary author in the first place. Duh! Well folks, I think all that Fido cares about is that he is loved and taken care of, not if the wind chimes are facing south and the mirror is facing north."
2,"Good for energy, but nothing else.","I have taken other maca products that did give a lift to my libido, but these did not. I did have a little more energy than usual, but that's it. The maca powder is your best bet and you can find great recipes to use it with if you do some online searches. It tastes good with cocoa powder, mesquite meal powder, almond milk, and agave nectar.A good brand in the capsules is lifetime brand? I believe that's the brand. Each capsule is 750 mg. each."
1,It performs very poorly and is poorly supported.,"I am returning the one I bought right now. If you are expecting to use this gamepad with games that use mouse/keyboard combination controls, do NOT buy it. The mouse function is slow and choppy and impossible to control. It's so poor you'll go back to the mouse and keyboard.My system is only 6 mos. old: Dell PIII 1Ghz system w/256 MB RAM, so it's not the computer, and I followed the instructions packaged w/the gamepad to upgrade to their newest drivers and the newest patch (took forever - their ftp site is also slooooow).I experimented with different setups and different games, hoping I could get things going, to no avail. In addition - I see no mention about this ""force feedback"" anywhere in their software or on their support page...if you want to use that feature.I'm really upset that I will end up paying 1/3 what this item costs just for shipping and I end up with nothing!"
3,Layout & DOA Button,"This gamepad is nice and works well with some games.However, after much research, it is difficult to find and locate a good layout for sports games such as Madden 2002.One of the buttons, button 6, was DOA.A comparison layout with PS, N64, and other control would be helpful. (Button X = Button 1, and so on.)"
4,Very Good But Not Perfect,"The pad is very comfortable to hold, and the buttons are well placed. The biggest problem is the buttons are not labled for easy referance (1,2..etc). It takes some time to figure this out. It is very responsive though, and the rumble feature works well. The pad is well made and can take a beating, from the occational drop to the button mashing of fighting games. A good addition to your gaming arsenal."
2,Tried to do too much in one title,"This let me down. It is an ambious title and I like this author's other work but this falls flat. Supposed to cover British Cavalry gear from The Napoleaonic period through early WW2 it really spends most of it's energy on Chapell's strong point, the Victorian era. All well and good but if that's what you're doing, call it that and don't make buyers think you're doing much more.If you want Victorian and that is what his name draws you too, then it's fine but if you want earlier or later stuff, resist the urge and pass this by. It doesn't live up to the hope."
3,"If you are looking for the quintessential Roth, skip this one","The idea for this book is a good one - the bitter confessions of a Czarist spy and illegitimate son of a Russian noble serving as a hook for deeper reflections on identity, displacement and loss. These are familiar themes for Roth and with his epigrammatic style he has produced other literary gems building on similarly fantastical foundations. Not this time however. By the time he wrote Confession of a Murderer, Joseph Roth was ill, living in exile in Paris and clearly under pressure to write to help make ends meet. The result is a sorry mess of a story, with too much repitition, unlikely co-incidences and unconvincing characters. Occasionally flashes of the old Roth shine through but the book is far from being as the narrator describes it a story that is ""neither short nor commonplace"", instead it is just plain boring."
3,shaw carpet stain remover,"What is product has going for it is, that it does not smell bad like some cleaners and it leaves little to no residue. It seems to work ok on fresh stains. The reason I bought it was to remove some set in marker stains. It failed at that."
5,Shaw carpet spot cleaner,"This has worked well on our Shaw carpet. Leaves no odor, and removes the odor from pet stains, with a little work."
2,Dissapointed,"I don't know if it was my cable company, or the modem, but the second I had this modem up and running, I had flaws uploading, I could no longer email anything with an attatchment, and it wasnt a software problem, anyways I purchased a different modem and it worked fine, so I dont know if its not compatible or what, but I don't find it reliable, and others I have spoken to have had similar problems."
1,Unreliable hardware,"Initial setup & perfomance were excellent.However, the modem only worked for about 1 week (24 hours/day). The symptom was the missing green ""cable"" light, indicating that the cable signal was not reaching the modem. In troubleshooting, I went through the following hassles:- Visit from AT&T technician, who identified the problem down to the faulty modem. (will charge for the visit, if the problem is on your side.)- Modem switching fee, when you register your replacement modem. (This is in addition to the initial switching fee for putting the Best Data modem in service.)Given the difficulty in identifying hardware failures and subsequent hassles, I do not recommend this unreliable hardware."
3,Save money buy instead of lease,"I purchased this modem,hooked to my system and called AT&T.had it up and running in under 10 minutes,Glad I didn't believe some of the reviews here.The speed is great,and I am now saving [money every] month I highly recommend this modem."
4,It works as advertise.,(...)it connects faster at power-up then the old LandCity (sp) I was paying (price)for. I think it remembers the last connection settings and start the hunt from there. I would say that the download speed is the same as the old modem.(...)
1,SLOW!,"This modem was recommend by my ISP cox.net to replace the old Motorola unit I had been renting. This Best Data ""high-speed"" modem ran about 10 times slower than the Motorola unit. I checked some speed test web sites and was getting about 100 to 200 kbps. I hooked the Motorola unit back up and got 1.7 Mbps. The tech support guy at Cox suggested a Toshiba 1100. Maybe I received a defective unit, but I've returned it and will purchase the Toshiba."
3,Rebate from the manufacturer is a gimmck,"...The modem works o.k.,but the promised rebate has not been received from the manufacturer even though I followed the instructions to the letter to get the rebate. The rebate is a gimmick and trying to get it is a headache. If you do not mind getting the rebate, just go for it. Otherwise, you have to call the manufacturer and spend all the time waiting in vain for the rebate."
5,Works great! It's time to stop renting and buy this...,"This modem works great on the COX network. Hooked it up - all of 2 minutes, called the cable company with the included MAC address and I was off and running. It's quicker than the Motorola modem I was renting at ...a month! With the great price from Amazon my purchase will pay for itself in only 9 months. One other thing, the power consumption is low at 8 Watts or less, about as much as a nightlight.This is a very sensible investment, unless you like donating to the cable companies!"
3,Easy to setup. No On/Off button. Holds the old RAS.,"Very easy to set it up, good operation, and no overheating. Supported by Cox. As it was already pointed out in another review it doesn't have an On/Off button. Also it holds to the old RAS in memory and if you would like to connect a different machine, DHCP process would fail and you won't be able to get an IP, unless you cycle it off -- by unplugging the cord since there is no On/Off button."
3,"fast, but had trouble (modem failure)","I bought this CMX110 to replace my rented RCA cable modem from ATTBI. I had no problems getting ATTBI to enter it into their system (just a quick visit to the local ATTBI office).Yes, it was fast, although I'm not sure if it was faster than the RCA device was. My service is 1500 kbps down/320 kbps up and the modem handled that just fine (187KB/sec was seem often enough). Unfortunately the modem just died yesterday with the yellow test lamp on. BestData's tech support number (long distance mind you) had me in queue for about 20-25 minutes, and couldn't do advance replacement (using credit card as collateral)..."
5,Great Product,"I replaced the modem supplied by the cable company with this Best Data model. Installation was simple and one call to the cable company to give them the MAC address and Serial Number of the modem was all I needed to do to transfer my service to the new modem (although it took several hours for it to make it through the ATT cable system computers).I have had it in service for about 3 months, on line 24 hours a day without any disconnects or lockups. My download speeds are 1500 KBits/sec which is about twice what the old modem delivered."
3,Some dangerous stuff there,"I read through the book several years ago. One thing that is dangerously wrong is his advice not to wash strawberries, they do not come pre-washed and will (not may: WILL) need to be washed for safety reasons, there were a few other minor things but that type of advice will get people killed. If you are too lazy to wash and dry the strawberries before dipping you should not be making food for other people."
1,Definitely not for Dummies,"I am an adult up in years and certainly do not considermyself a dummy. However I have been for years one ofthose people who are very timid about making candyespecially as several times I have made, never fail fudgeand guess what it was a mess. This book in my estimationis for t hose people who are advanced in candy making.The directions were definitely not for dummies. in makingpeanut butter balls it states to temper the chocolate go tochapter 14 (most dummies would like the chocolate coatingto be in same place as the peanut butter) then figure outfirst what tempering means; oh yes there is a definitionbut again it is definitely not for dummies. Findingrecipies was a pain in the neck. I'd seen the otherreviews about how it is obviously the most marvelous bookever written on making candy and that probably a 5year old could do it. We must have been reading differentbooks."
1,Don't use the book,"I bought this book in September 2006 and In November, tried the Simple Microwave Fudge (page 112). Made a notation saying:""Don't make again. Kept in freezer - too soft."" I wrote to David Jones, President of Hansel & Gretel Candy Kitchen, and he e-mailedsaying that ""The softness you describe comes from the moisture in the fudge. As you microwave, you remove some of that moisture and proper firmness is achieved through executing this process the proper amount of time. Try heating 30 seconds longer and see if that makes a difference. It may require more than one trial but you will find success.""Sorry, but I am not about to waste my time and costly ingredients experimenting by trial and error. Either write a book with the correct directions or don't. I didn't find success with this book, I just found that I wasted $20 on a book."
2,"techniques valid, recipes suck","The overall techniques in the book, such as tools you need, how to temper chocolate, the science behind candy making are good and presented in a way that is enjoyable. The recipes are where this book falls very, very short. I have made 3 of them now and they all were bad. The caramels never set, the jellies are way too soft and the cherry creme centers are also to wet and too soft and softened in the tempered chocolate. The ingredients you need to make candy are far too expensive to be wasting. All these recipes should have been tested, how do you publish a cookbook without testing recipes?I'm very disappointed in my purchase. Would be home candy makers would be better served getting their recipes off the internet. Of course while your scouring the web for recipes you can learn the techniques you need making this purchase completely unnecessary."
1,One of the worst movies ever...possibly the worst,"First of all, this movie really isn't about Bigfoot. It's about two people who hunt bigfoot. Their ""proof"" is a bunch of hard-to-see photos. I felt bad watching this movie because I believe it exploits a couple of men who are down on their luck and have questionable mental aptitude."
2,A Disappointment,"Not Your Typical Bigfoot Movie is a documentary that follows two ""underachievers"" from Portsmouth, Ohio, named Dallas and Wayne. The two became obsessive Bigfoot ""researchers"" as a way to pass the time.There is nothing in this movie to ""grab"" the viewer. Dallas doesn't really believe in Bigfoot - in fact, he fakes the evidence that he presents on radio shows. Wayne appears to be clinically depressed at his lot in life.At the end of this movie, my wife and I agreed that the film was a waste of time. Don't make the same mistake that we did - skip this one."
2,"May be plausible, but language stopped me cold.","The story line of friendship was somewhat attractive, but the language stopped me cold. Do not buy it if you have children, I wish I had thoroughly read all the reviews before I purchased it. I am from Portsmouth and know the poverty issues they deal with in Scioto county, and they were accurately portrayed. The bigfoot pictures were interesting and thought-provoking, if you lean towards a belief in Sasquatch anyway. I do wonder if this was a money-making ploy, though. All in all, I wouldn't buy it again."
5,Real...,"I felt that this doc captured the plight of the Appalachian man perfectly. I thought that the men showed a real love for Bigfoot, and are dead set on proving its existence. It is not your typical Bigfoot movie. Don't expect your mind to be changed about the existence of Bigfoot by this movie, perhaps though your mind will be changed about the plight of the poor. Don't listen to me though just go watch it."
1,Warning! Not an instrumental CD!,"I too was disappointed with this CD. I didn't realize these songs are actually sung by the ""piano men"", as they call themselves on the CD. Although the guy's voice does remotely sound like Billy Joel's with some massive reverb, I'm not sure why anyone would want to listen to anything but the origninal recordings.If you are looking for a REALLY GOOD tribute CD, the one called Piano Man, A Tribute to Billy Joel by Jeff Michaels is in fact all instrumental and I believe that's the CD the reviewer below was saying is great. It has some really nice versions of his songs on solo piano, and then some with violin and an English horn. And it's got all of Billy's classics on there - including Scenes From An Italian Restaurant - my personal favorite!"
4,Used Earth Basketry,"I received this item promptly, at a good price. It is in good, usable condition and will get a lot of use."
3,Beginners Pilates,"I think this is a great beginners Pilates video. It's great for someone on the run its just 15 minutes including warm up and cool down. I am out of my home 12 hours a day so this fits perfectly in my schedule before I leave for work until I get home, and then I do it before I go to bed. Its very easy to fit into your schedule. And its not one of those crazy do a million situps in 5 minutes ordeal, its easy relaxing yet you can still fell as though your getting something out of it."
3,"This is the bonus workout from ""AM PM Pilates Mat Workout""","""Energy Boost Pilates"" is the 15-minute bonus workout on ""AM PM Pilates Mat Workout"" with Jillian Hessel and Ana Caban.Ana is outside, alone, next to a large pond with lots of plants and trees surrounding her. The setting is very pretty and the music is soft. Ana cues in voice over. Ana starts with standing stretches and then adds jogging, rope jumping and front to back leg lunges for ""energy boost"". Afterwards, she moves onto the mat and does pilates (the 100s, roll ups, leg stretches, the tree, shoulder bridge, the mermaid, etc.) .There are no modifications and not much instructions (the workout is only 15 minutes!) on proper form and execution of moves for those new to pilates. Ana expects you to know the poses."
4,SWEET YET HARDCORE,"i really enjoyed this compilation, almost all female vocalists and its nice to hear different obscure singers and bands. on the first cd, i am in love with prolapse's ""chill blown"" and nina simone's ""my baby just cares for me"" is quite lovely. on the second cd, i'm really diggin brix e. smith's ""oringina"" and rita lynch's ""call me your girlfriend"" is by far the sexiest lesbian love song ever! on the third cd, ""teenile dementia"" by the morgan is real wild to listen to and ""strange fruit"" by billy holiday is a pure classic. all in love, delicious and wonderful compilation!"
1,Not Worldview so much as Christian View,"I've enjoyed several of the books in this ongoing series of culture and philosophy. I have to say that thus far this is my least favorite of the series. Most of the essays are Christian philosophy rather than ecumenical, a disappointment to anyone who has read any of the other books. While I realize that the Narnia books are deeply Christian, there are different ways of looking at the series over all, as Karin Fry's essay in this book proves. Unfortunately, her essay is the exception to this poorly edited volume in what is otherwise a good series. If you are a Christian, you will likely enjoy this book. If you are a Christian looking to learn more about other schools of philosophy other than theist, you should look elsewhere. If you are not a Christian and find ecumenical discussion tedious or boring, don't even bother with this book. There are too many other books on philosophy out there to bother reading this one."
2,Classic Book for anyone who wants to study Botany.......BUT,"Asa Gray was a pioneer in North American Botany, especially in taxonomy (plant identification). This book is a classic and is just as useful now as it was in the mid 1800's. The problem is that in the Kindle version, all the drawings have been left out, making the book useless. I recommend the printed version."
4,Surprisingly decent,The movie was actually pretty good. The story existed and had a few twists that made it better. No complaints for the few bucks I spent.
4,Restraint,The movie was in as good a condition as advertised. Arrived on time and in great condition. The movie was ok but I guess I had higher expectation.
4,"I like it, but only once.","Good to watch once. The story line was all over the place, and the events were a little far fetched as to how they interacted with each other, but if you're not a detail freak then it's a good thriller for a time waster. The ending left a lot of loose ends which just seemed like a good spot to end so they didn't have to figure out how to resolve anything. More like 3.5 out of 5."
3,This must be a remake of a movie I have seen before.,"I remeber seening a movie with this story line before, so it was just okay, nothing I would recommend. So if I had known this scenario was as such I probably would have passed it by."
4,Fantastic Aussie Thriller~,"Just when you think you've got it all sorted out.....You realize you don't! Nice acting, editing and cinematography! True Blood fans will love the character ""Andrew"" as well!!"
3,Interesting twists,"Decent plot, keeps you guessing where this will end up... all the way through the end. Some pieces were less developed. Towns people behavior seems made to fit what is going on in the story at the time rather than helping to shape it."
4,Surprised!,"No fancy computer graphics, no big production, not many stars come to think of it BUT what a simple and tight storyline. The acting is excellent and Teresa Palmer is just gorgeous!A enjoyable movie overall."
4,Useful if somewhat limited book,"Mark Wilson is certainly a name in magic and has been around for a very long time. It was on the strength of that name alone that I bought this book, but it wasn't really as comprehensive as I would have liked. Many of the presentations are useful to beginning and intermediate performers as they are. A full time professional like me can fall back on these presentations as well, but over all this is second string material for me.[...]"
4,Fascinating projects,"I have not made anything from this book yet, but it has some fascinating projects. I would not have a child do any of them, though, unless careful hands-on supervision by an adult. The projects involve things like making jewelry from stones (involves drilling holes with high-power drills), making cement tiles with stone decorations, and constructing stick furniture. One of the easiest involves painting delicate pictures in black and white paint on rocks, and the results are stunning, though perhaps beyond the capabilities of many crafters. Nevertheless I find the book very inspirational and quite charming."
4,Varied range of selections,"This CD collection includes a dozen artists doing a dozen songs. The track list is as follows:Christmas Cometh Caroling - Kenny LogginsGrown Up Christmas List - Natalie ColeAve Maria - Barry ManilowO Come All Ye Faithful - Air SupplyIt Came Upon a Midnight Clear - Tony OrlandoJoy To The World - The SupremesHark The Herald Angels Sing - AmericaGod Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen - Bobby VintonAway in a Manger - Olivia Newton-JohnChristmas Spirit - Donna SummerLittle Drummer Boy - Jackson FiveSilent Night - Melissa ManchesterA portion of the proceeds for this CD go to the Children's Miracle Network and the City of Hope foundations. It's a nice selection with a little bit of rock, soul and mellow sounds. I never heard the cuts by Olivia and Melissa before. Well known artists singing sounds for the holidays on a CD where some of the proceeds goes to charity. Sort of what Christmas is all about."
3,Not very good,"I purchased this product with high hopes, but my computer thought it was a joystick. I could not convince the computer it was a racing wheel, so it kind of screwed things up. And I have a brand-new computer with the latest edition of Windows XP. But it is a good racing wheel, and if it worked right, then I would definately give it five stars."

4,Smooth Disco,"For fans of the disco era, these re-recordings by the Marvelettes are sure to please. 18 sensual tracks in smooth rythms."
3,not for me .,"examples are not great.they need to be more practical.book seems to be written for people with COM experience.lingo used throughout the book assumes you have been ""OOP-ing"" in another language.C++ coders wanting to transition to VB.NET would appreciate this book."
3,Very Durable Hearing Protection - Recommended,"The Silencio ""Original Earmuff"" are decent hearing protectors and have held up well with fairly heavy usage over several years. Here are my observations:* These are a little heavy for extended wearing, but just fine for use at the range* The sound attenuation is good for even the largest calibers* There are better models available now, likeSilencio Black Earmuffs w/Liquid Filled Cushion For Added Comfort Md: 3010460 .Recommended, but do checkout the newer models.CFH"
2,Find a different book.,If you are like me and learn from example this book is not for you. It gives you some of the code but leaves the more pieces out forcing you to go online and hope you can find what you need. Overall I found this book to be a waste of my money.
1,"No examples, way too wordy, I'd pass on this one","This book is fantastic at going over topics in verbose and excruciating detail, but never shows you how to put the pieces together and use them. I'm on the linked list section, I understand everything perfectly, but to put it together and write a program with the material? I just don't know where to start. This book is too wordy and contains no examples, (well there are code snippets but these are worthless.).I love how all the positive reviews are from people who already know this stuff, they don't understand how crappy this book for someone without prior knowledge of the book's material.why is it so hard to just have one complete SIMPLE program with using a linked list and manipulating the nodes (I mean all class) so the reader can see, OH SO THIS IS HOW YOU IMPLEMENT IT! Waste of money, better books out there.Also loved how an author came in and gave it 5 stars to offset the bad reviews while announcing it, real classy pal."
1,yiddish: learn the most favorite expressions,"Howard Kaplan can't speak Yiddish, the accent is awful, and the delivery is flat, what's next a hip hop project for dummies? This one is going back."
5,Brilliant lens,"(purchased Jan 2003) I bought this lens to use for ""candid portrait"" photography, and have captured brilliant images of my two fast-moving sons. The wide maximum aperature (f 1.4) and nine-blade aperature mechanism draw attention to the subject of the photographs by causing things that are not in focus to be blurred nicely. More importantly, this lens is extremely sharp. Its images are very detailed and the color contrast is excellent. I have not had trouble with flare, but when the sun strikes the front element, image contrast suffers. Therefore, keep the large lens shade on when shooting outside. The focus is very fast on a Nikon F100.The only downsides? Closest focus is not great, and the cost!"
5,The lens my D700 has been waiting for!,"I have a variety of Nikon and Sigma lenses and the 85mm 1.4 surpasses them all. The previous reviewers are not wrong: the sharpness and bokeh are things you must see to believe. The saturation and contrast must also not be forgotten: I do very little post-processing on photos shot with this lens. I hesitated for a long time because of the price, but now that it's in my hands, I have no regrets!"
5,Fantastic Wide-Angle Lens,"This lens is a superb addition to my growing lens collection. Combined with my 70-300mm VR lens, I have a ton of capability in a small package. This lens is a great value for me. I suppose someday I'll move up to a more expensive wide-angle, but I'll have to REALLY need to.Pros: Great value, light-weight, sturdy. Feels solid and comfortable when shooting manually.Cons: Focus ring is very touchy and just a slight touch will spin it."
3,Very light but poor optical quality,Very soft in corners when wide open. The only advantage is its weight - it is a very light lens.
2,Lens flare,"There is nothing else to say: lots of lens flare, CA, strong distortion, even for a wide angle lens. Not worth the price, even if it is the cheapest wide angle lens from Nikon."
5,Way overpriced piece of plastic,"Does its job. Works great.Just cannot figure out why it's so expensive. Maybe if it said Leica on it. But Nikon?Seems that if Nikon truly cared about us, it would come standard with the lens."
5,"One of my ""desert island"" cookbooks","I've owned a copy of this book for years and years, and purchased many more to give to friends and family as gifts. The stories in this book are excellent, but the recipes are even better. The recipe in this book for Tuna Salad is, in my humble opinion, the best in the world, and I wish that it would be more widely adopted (it's a little different - tart, not sweet). Other fabulous recipes are the recipe for a very garlicky hummus, the greek salad, the recipe for tabbouleh, the pasta dishes, the sandwiches, and a way to make your own homemade ginger ale.I very highly recommend this book. I have tons of cookbooks, and this is one of my top five.Also, I don't eat beef or chicken, and there's still plenty of recipes that I can make and love."
5,"Usable, yummy recipes with stories that add extra.","This is one of my most favorite cookbooks, with easy-to-prepare, unique recipes such as tasso sandwiches and cream of watercress soup that are fun to make and delightful to eat. Stories that accompany the recipes give an added special flavor to each one."
5,"Great cookbook, great message","There are billions of recipe books out there, and if you have a reliable internet connection, you could get any recipe you wanted with a simple web search. Sacramental Magic In A Small-town Cafe reminds us of why food is more than just a list of ingredients. It is about the meaning behind the food, about the story behind the restaurant.Written by a couple who worked for a Jesuit-based ministry, they were about feeding peoples' souls as well as their stomachs. They did research and testing into their recipes, trying out ancient recipes and new ones, looking to see what felt comforting and what was nutritious. They tell fascinating background stories about what they cooked, what worked, why people reacted the way they did.Food is the way we connect with others, nourish ourselves for another day, This book is an awesome way to get that message.Well recommended."
3,Serving Food with a spirit,"Catholic order operates restaurants all over the world under name of Franciscan mond named Brother Juniper.Here is little selection of everything from soup to dessert, and between. Some caught my attention that are delicious: Lemon Walnut Muffins, Tuna Cheese Grinder,Spanish Lentil and Sausage Soup,.Received free. Likely would not have paid for it. Interesting tales with recipes."
1,Listening to this album is painful,"I've heard nails scraped on chalkboard that sound better than the vocals in this band's version of Stairway to Heaven.Led Zeppelin not only wrote beautiful songs, they also played them with a virtuosity that no other band can ever come close to recreating. What's the point of trying to make covers of Zeppelin songs when it is impossible to do anything but detract badly -- very badly -- from the song?Trust me, this isn't like Jimi Hendrix ripping off a Dylan song and improving the dynamic and the engergy of the song ala ""All along the watchtower."""
1,Horrible,This is the worst music I have ever heard. It is a horrible idea to take classic rock songs and remake them with what sounds like a keyboard and a horrible singer.
2,"Not terrible at all, just rather pointless","Contrary to the rather hysterical ""this is the worst music ever created"" reviews that I have seen here, this so called ""tribute album"" to Led Zeppelin is, musically, actually reasonably listenable in a rather dull ""music they play in the background in the supermarket"" type way. It certainly isn't terrible, but it is all rather pointless because you may as well just listen to Led Zeppelin.Having said that, it is no more pointless than anything you will see on ""The X Factor""."
1,Can you say garbage?,This has to be the worst CD i have ever purchased! Not one good track. Definetly not worth even a pennie! Dont waste your time
1,Wrong picture for item,"I'm not sure what I would be buying, the picture displayed shows different sizes than advertised? Clarification of this is mandatory before purchasing.Thanks"
2,A biased look at a real social problem,"Anticipating an objective account of a serious social issue, I found instead in _Runaway kids and teenage prostitution_ a curious mix of scientific research, media sensationalism, and conservative Christian moralizing. The cautious reader must diligently check the ""facts"" reported in this work against their sources as listed in the extensive endnotes. While some of the book is grounded in solid social science research, its weakness is that it juxtaposes this with pseudo-science and claims made by the Christian right. Far too many of Mr. Flowers' child prostitution ""experts"" are journalists concerned more about appealing to a mass market than conducting objective research. A thorough critique of this approach is provided by Dr. Philip Jenkins in his book, _Moral panic: Changing concepts of the child molester in modern America_ (1998, Yale University Press)."
2,stupid,It was so stupid! I quit reading two-thirds into the book because I was afraid my IQ would plummet reading this piece of junk. You're better reading a stupid comic book.
4,"Hardware potential is there, drivers may not be.","Given that most people who look for a video card that can run their 3D games, I was surprised that the Radeon would be able to run up to par with the Nvidia's GeForce2 (of course, not beating it all the time). Though, 3D is not everything. The ATI Radeon has superb 2D quality, which can only be topped by Matrox. Their DVD playback/decoder is one of the best in the industry. So for overall performance, the ATI Radeon is a card that can satisfy you in all areas.Though, there is only one nagging thing about this video card. In history, ATI has a lot of trouble releasing good performing drivers. This may be important since we are going to have different OS's every two years or so. Though, the hardware potential is there. If ATI would get their driver development straight, I would have given this card 5 stars.So, if you are looking for speed for your 3D games, buy another 3D card. If you want the whole package, this is the card for you."
5,Excellent Product from ATI,"I am avid computer upgrade geek formerly loyal to S3 and 3DFX. Now that they are both out of business I looked to ATI for my graphics needs. For some reason I hate Nvidia, same reason why I use AMD and hate Intel.This video card just works perfect with my Via KT133A and Athlon 1000Mhz CPU. You just need to install Via's 4-in-1 drivers and DirectX 8. It should work fine afterwards. People shouldn't bash this card without trying to fix the problem.The best feature that this card has that Nvidia GeForce2 lacks is DVD playback. This thing plays DVDs better than any software based solution. It also plays Counter-Strike and other games with great quality and speed.I give this video card a perfect score. But I really need to get a new monitor, that has been screwing things up for me."
4,second best darkthrone release!!!,"This is a great black metal album (second best Darkthrone release after Blaze in th....) though it is not for every one. If you're new to black metal get something by Immortal, Dimmu Borgir or one of the first three releases of Cradle Of Filth but otherwise get this raw, dark, haunting piece of art!!!!!"
1,dont buy this,"this cd is pure [junk]. it doesnt even deserve 1 star. if u like the pop filled cradle of filth or dimmu borgirs poser releases u mite like this cd or think of it as talented. this is raw, poorly recorded, untalented metal. the drums sound horrible, is there even a bass? but if u want real black metal look for anthems to the welkin at dusk."
5,Everyday Use puts a spoiled child in her place..,"I think this book's imagery is amazing, and really gives you the perfect picture of the characters. Alice Walker did a great job ""weaving"" this story and showing us different kinds of African Americans and the heritage that is passed down with family traditions and quilts. This is definitely worth a read to all people, African American or not because we all can relate to the emotions the characters feel. This story is about a mother who was always torn between her two daughters and finally learns how to take a stand. Read it and enjoy!"
5,An excellent book,"This book was an excellent book. It clearly maps out the life story of a man who over came a rough childhood and acheived greatness through God, family, and his love of flying. This man is no other than my Grandfather, Jack Schweibold, I love you grandpa.Steven"
5,The Oxford book of Death,beautiful book for those who ponder the realms and possibilities of death. Opens the mind to intense thought and imagination.
3,Mediocre product - fair price,"I like this slicer, and it works fine for most stuff, but I have to say that the slicer does NOT work well for harder stuff. For example, the German-style bread (which means that the crust is very hard and the bread is very havy) I bake can not be cut very well with this slicer. Furthermore, because of the hard crust and the faulty design of the slicer, the bread gets stuck when it is cut, that is, you can cut only about 1 1/2 inches into the bread because it gets stuck because the crust is too hard - oh, well! Anyway, other than that I really like this product - it is good for slicing your own pork loin rosts into nice pork chops!!!!! Overall, it was a fair price for an unfortunatly only mediocre product...maybe in this case more money will get you a better deal ?!?!?"
1,Extremely poor quality,"I had this safe for 2 years. Apart from the poor quality (will get to it shortly), the safe really didn't have much space to hold anything. For what it was worth, I used it (open/close) rarely for 2 years and one day the when I was trying to open the safe, the handle broke right off. I accidentally closed the door and that was it. There was no way for me to open it again. I had to use a screwdriver, pry open the area around the handle, push the small lever inside that the handle would otherwise have pushed to open the safe, removed the screws and threw the safe in the trash. A piece of junk really...save yourself a few bucks...don't buy this safe."
1,Poor Quality,"It was a poorly made piece of junk made in China. The welding was very unfinished and alignment of the hinges was so bad the door didn't close properly. If that wasn't bad enought, the space inside was very limited, and not all of the shelves are movable. Save your money."
2,not so much safe,"There is no interior space in this safe due to the electronic lock mechanism. A shame really, but if all you need is a wall safe to store a few papers than ok but nothing like a fire arm or anything will fit. Product returned."
4,Wall Safe,Like the safe but the screws that come with it are not long enough to be secure. If you purchase longer screws (at least in our case) you will be satisfied.
2,No Room At All,"This is a neat safe for storing a few small valuables that you may not want to keep lying around. The key words are small and few, as the previous poster stated this safe has very little inside room. There is no room for any type of firearm, document binder etc... Save your money do not buy if you need more than .25 cubic feet.The locking mechanism is solid but the interior is poorly made with thin sheet metal."
1,Quality assurance,"The box was not damaged, but the safe was bent, the code didn't work, and the key over-ride did work. Some one must have just thrown this package together without even testing if it opened with the code or key.We called support and they told us to do everything we had already done. There final comment was to ship it back.We arranged for a replacement, but instead our money was refunded."
5,"great story, but not same author as ""policeman small""","We really enjoy this book. It's not realistic about firefighting in any sense. All the characters, except fireman small, are animals. Kids who are into the vocabulary and mechanics of firefighting won't find much here; this story is about helping friends and neighbors and being selfless. I have read this book to my 2 1/2 year old son at least 100 times, at least 5x in a row on occasion.I initially bought it because we enjoyed Policeman Small by Lois Lenski. This is a different character and a different author. The corresponding fireman book for Policeman Small is The Little Fire Engine (which has surprising story line where a family moves their furniture out when house on fire, and back in when fire is out ... not the safest message to send kids about fires!)"
4,Really cute,"This is a very cute story of a fireman (the only firefighter this side of the bay!) who deals with a series of escalating problems alone: Rescuing a kitty from a tree, a child from a well, and finally putting out a fire!The use of rhythm is terrific, and the illustrations are great.I will note that it's unrealistic. Real firefighters work in teams utilizing the buddy system, and a child who is *really* obsessed with firefighters will know that."
4,Tremendous impact in French Beethoven recording,"I took a chance on this 3 CD recording of Beethoven's ten sonatas for violin and piano, and was pleasantly surprised.Sonatas 1-4 are on disc one, sonatas 5-7 on disc two, and sonatas 8-10 on disc three. Since I haven't heard more than excerpts from the sonatas before, I don't have a lot to compare these with, but my impression is that they are a very fine recording of the Sonatas at a very reasonable price. The liner notes, in French and English, of course, are also very helpful. Highly recommended.Diane CarderFerndale, WA"
1,What the Heck?,"I will admit, there is a ton of very interesting information in this book.I was blown away by the shortage of photographs. There are many, many very important and impressive buildings without a photograph.Actually most of the buildings described do not have photos. It is like a book on dog breeds that just describes what a Beagle looks like.I realize there are ""rights"" issues with photographs, but please. Shame on the publisher and the West Virginia Humanities Council for notpulling the needed photos. Very disappointed."
3,lips like morphone,"Lips like morphone is by far the best part of this CD, but it is not the end all either. There are other good tracks, but that is the best."
5,kill hannah new cd <3333333,this is by far my favorite cd by kill hannah when you listen to the songs my favorite song is blakc poison blood and when you start listening to it it just grabs you <3 i saw kill hannah live and they are by far the best band ive ever seen :]
5,"Chitown's finest....no, seriously.","So, if you're wondering whether or not you should pick up Kill Hannah's sophomore album, GO FOR IT. The new CD mixes old with new, blending tons of melodic piano pieces with some hardcore shredding on guitar. The first and last songs are almost identical in structure, but convey a very different message. ""Believer"", track 2 on the album, gives every fan a sense of hope. A sense that this band will be around forever...and for an old fan of many years to hear the lines, ""Until there's nothing left of us,"" it is a very sentimental thing. Each song isn't as drug-related or as wild as Kill Hannah's previous plays, but we've been asking for more of a ""real life"" performance packed into a single CD, and the band has achieved that exactly. You feel like you're hearing the boys live. So, pick up Kill Hannah's new album ""Until There's Nothing Left of Us"". You will NOT be disappointed."
3,ok,A tepid CD. Its ok even good. Not exactly my speed. Decide for yourself here because this is not horrible music at all.
3,Decent but not amazing,"I got this CD simply because a family member gave me some sum of dollars to purchase amazon MP3s and I loved the song Lips Like Morphine aaand that's about where my liking for this CD ended, Under the Milky Way is the only other song on this CD I liked. The CD as a whole wasn't bad but it wasn't great either."
2,"ok, but covers way too many years and models",I have a 1989 240 and find this manual not specific enough because it covers 18 years and many different models. Example: I wanted to remove my radio and the only radio featured was for a completely different model. I also purchased the 240 specific manual (blue cover) and found it much better because it covers just 240's.
1,Save a Tree,"This book won't be very helpful; it attempts to cover far too much material. The editing is shoddy also, with quite a few errors, such as listing the crankshaft dimensions of the B23 and B230 engines as identical."
3,"In response to ""A reader from San Diego, California""s review","Actually, reader, there is no such thing as a ""240 proper."" This may be the source of your trouble. The cover of the book lists 242s, 244s, and 245s. Think you don't have one of these? Try counting the doors on your 240. If you have two doors, that's a 242, four doors is a 244 and a 5 door wagon is a 245. Volvo named all of their models by series, cylinder, and number of doors, thus a 262 is a two-hundred series (like the 240) with a six cylinder engine and two doors. I do not own this book so i cannot fairly review it, but it seems like the biggest problem you had with it is due to your own fault."
2,Worked fine...for two days!,"I installed the product on an older model door and choose this keypad because it was the least expensive I could find anywhere. I suppose you get what you pay for because two days after installation, the product stopped working properly and would keep trying to open the door after it was already opened making terrible loud noises. I disconnected the product and now the door works fine again. I would recommend spending a bit more on a better quality product."
1,Don't Bother!,"Don't bother getting this book. Several of the things it says to do are illegal, like go do Graffiti, & get arrested, Other's most people will not able to do such as get a painting in a gallery or write a great American novel.If your want to do something fun and new save your money use Google, & take the money you saved & buy something fun."
2,Ugh,"I gave two stars just for effort. This book has some good things to do...reading books, watching movies, getting married in an unusual way. But there are some that are downright awful. Getting arrested? Participating in a threesome? ""Getting off"" with a rock star? This book is not suitable for people who have any sort of morals, whatsoever. Please do not buy this book unless you intend to do some pretty crazy, immoral things."
2,don't waist your money...,"This book is ok at best... some of the things it suggests are kinda dumb and not very realistic. Also, it doesn't really give you much advice on HOW to go about doing some of these things..."
3,Ok.... but got old,"I read this book about 3 years ago and every so often I pull it off my shelf and get a kick out of reading it. The ideas are more for ""entertainment"" purposes.. if you want to change your life call a hospital and volunteer or a soup kitchen.. this will not help"
1,101 Things to Do Before You Die,"I was looking for a book to encourage me to get out and live life to its fullest. This book is a disgrace to humanity. 85% of its suggestions of things to do before you die are either illegal or immoral. I didn't want to waste the money to send it back and I refuse to give it to anyone. The solid waste dump seemed most appropriate, so that's where I put it."
1,Nice star stickers and burns good too,"This book is completly useless even to those who may be interested in the topic. It's list of things to do are so varied and scrambled that it doesn't fit any single target audience. It lists things like 'Get Arrested' and 'Get Off With a Rock Star'. And yes, they do mean 'get off' in that way. Do I recomend this book to anyone? Absolutely not. Given the types of things listed in the book, it's not likely you'd want to share it with your children or loved ones; because really, what family member really needs to know all the sexual positions you've accomplished?"
2,How 'bout them Dawgs!,"WOOO, WOOO, WOOO, WOOO, WOOO! Being a Mississippi State fan, I've been letting them dawgs out for awhile! This version is pretty good, but not as energetic and catchy as the Chuck Smooth version."
4,Great Lens,"This lens is the BEST! I can get about 2 inches from my subject and still focus! the auto focus doesn't work with the Nikon D40 because it needs AF-S, but I am fine with using manual focus. Truly, I don't care about the inability to zoom. Overall a great lens."
5,Nikon 60mm f2.8AF,"If you are looking for a close up lens, this is it. Its 1:1 life size reproduction will make the subject jump out at you. The lens is fast enough (f2.8)so that operation in auto mode will produce quality pictures even if the subject moves on you. And of course, it's a Nikon, which means it is the highest quality of lenses. Blow ups should be ""picture Perfect"". I bought this lens for close up model railroad work, which means at times, I'm looking for a lot of depth of field. For this, I will be using the manual mode, a tripod, lots of light and time exposure, stopping the lens down as far as possible (f32, if needed). This is to make the picture as life like as possible. As a 1:1 macro, the lens should be able to handle this well."
5,Happy Camper,I am very happy with this lens. It increases my range of photography and is easy to use.
4,Nikon 60mm f2.8D AF -Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras.,"Lens is awesome. Everything I expected. However Amazon's packaging left much to be desired. This expensive lens came in a cardboard box with one inflated air pillow. What you would expect if you were buying a hardcover book -- not a precision piece of glass. Fortunately, it was undamaged upon arrival. However, if the price is close I'd buy from one of the photo store vendors that Amazon features just to get decent packaging."
1,NOT compatible with D40,"Yes, yes -- of course it's a great piece of glass but Nikon D40 needs an AF-S lens and NOT just AF.Returned it for a refund. The AF-S macro is $780. Great. I switched over to Olympus E510 camera which I feel is a much better buy, a much better system. Nikon is an icon for people who either want to burn money or demanding professionals who understand that a *professional quality* lens costs thousands of dollars--not hundreds.Nikon has lenses that sell for $4,000 to $20,000. THAT is professional. But for a Macro, the 60mm is a huge, fast, sharp piece of glass if you have a non AF-S camera body."
5,Stands up to toughest test.,"My 50 mm Sigma macro was stolen, so I bought this (60mm micro-nikkor) as a replacement. I was completely satisfied with the Sigma (which is much less expensive), but this is a better lens. I've been shooting ice formations and crystals all winter (with a D300), often in bright sunlight, which will show any, and all aberrations. There are none, that I can detect. The only complaint (and this would be true, to some extent, with any af lens): With the low levels of contrast in ice photography, the af spends a lot of time on the road. Manual focus is easy to get to, and works just fine. All in all, a superb lens."
2,Great inside stuff hurt by poor writing,"This look at an important if obscure aspect of American literary history of the postwar era is marred by the poor, dry writing style of author Bonn. He does a better job as a librarian and archivist, retrieving lots of intriguing memoes and production files regarding the paperback publication of significant writers of the 40s-50s."
2,Not a must read,"Armed with the work of one professor on the legends of a group of psychic warriors in Northern Italy and an extremely free definition of ""shaman"" the author wends his unsubstantiated way through the real and pseudo history of Witchcraft in Europe."
2,I thought these games were way cool when I was 10,"Now I'm 30. I thought it would be cool to have Pitfall and River Raid (and it is) but the problem comes with having to control everything on your keyboard. There is probably a way to hook a joystick up but I could not get it to work. I gave up since I had such a time installing it on Windows XP (major compatibility problems). I eventually got it to work but it did not work with my sound card. Be sure you have Windows 95 or 98 with the proper soundcard (they should be listed somewhere). Sure it's a blast from the past but it's not like playing it on your 2600. Best games: Pitfall, Barnstorming, Seaquest, and Grand Prix. Many games were to hard to play or figure out."
2,Major compatibility issues,"This title has major compatibility issues: I could not get it to run on Windows 2000, and I suspect Windows XP and WinNT would have similar issues. I *WAS* able to get it working under Windows 98, but it crashes on startup if you don't *EXPLICITLY* set your desktop to 256 colors before launching it."
2,Watch for system requirements,"The product arrived in great shape and very quickly (very good vendor). The problem I had is that to run this software you need some old system componets that even my 5 year old computer did not have. I got the video issue resolved (must run in low resolution, 256 color mode) but I could not resolve the FM sound card issue. The game is playable but without the sounds a lot of the experience is lost."
2,no 2600,These are great titles but lets face it its not the 2600 experience. You dont get the feel of an atari joystick or the classic look while playing it on your big screen with the ole atari system next to you while you jump over gators in pitfall or when you are riding down a river shoting things in river raid.
5,Very readable,"Great info and easily readable. Lots of good points and very honest about gambling as a losing proposition. Helped me feel comfortable as I approached the tables, and gave me confidence - not that I would win, but that I would not embarass myself by not knowing the rules and etiquette of the games. Tells you what the games are with the lowest casino edge (there are none with a players edge), and what the real sucker bets are. Tells it like it is - no hype and drama."
3,Casino Gambling,"OK book, delivered as expected, not out of this world on the text or techniques on casino gambling, I did not see a good trick to play but it is OK"
4,easy to read,"I liked reading this book, it explained the games well but i haven't had a chance to actually play for real to know if I learned anything from the book."
3,wish I bought the physical book.,"I wish, in retrospect that I would have ordered the book rather than downloading it to my kindle.The content was OK but disappointing."
4,GOOD BOOK TO HAVE AND REFRESH,GOOD TOOL TO HAVE AND READ TO LEARN AND REFRESH BEFORE GOING TO ACTUAL CASINOS. THIS BOOK WILL HELP TO LEARN THE FUNCTIONS OF A CASION AS WELL. GOOD INSIDE KNOWLEDGE.
2,Letdown,Got to be a better book on coming up on the casinos small info on all games u get the basics but little more do your homework search for a more in depth book.
1,Junk!,This product is not worth buying. I purchased one and it stopped working within weeks of bying it. After contacting the supplier they sent a second unit. It worked for a while and one zone failed in the open mode. I'm not sure how long the water was on before I discovered it was permanently on.Don't buy this. The other reviews are right...it's junk!
1,Don't buy this one,"Another rainbird product that failed quickly. The rainbird timers (possibly those from Home Depot), including this one, work for about 1 to 2 weeks. They fill with water and shortcircuit the electronics. Once the units are opened and dried they perform only until they again fill with water. The seals appear to be intact yet they still leak. This timer only worked tempoarily on the first timer stage but not the second. The timer on the second never worked and only allowed the valve to remain ""on"". I attempted to contact rainbird, but have not at this time received a return call."
1,Don't buy this...,"Returning my 2nd R682CP in the past two weeks as the Zone 2 shut off does not work. The first one turned on when it should have been turned off, this one the Zone 2 does not shut off completely resulting in water waste. Two strikes and you're out for me!!!"
1,Raindrip dual timer failed in less than 2 years,"I purchased this timer less than 2 years ago and I am already shopping for a replacement. I do not know what part of the mechanism broke. I do know however that the battery compartment constantly let water in, including when I tried to insulate it with additional layer of silicone. This would kill the 9v battery and the device would go out of commission. I would only notice when the plants started to look half-dead. Overall, it is a garbage product. If I could, I would replace it with another product."
1,Don't buy this Timer (or maybe any Rain Drip stuff),"Have had 4 different timers and this Rain Drip Dual Station is the worst ever..Worked 2 weeks and must have internal short (water leaking?) as batteries go dead in a day. Threaded coupling for hoses is not deep enough and some hoses pop out. Unbelievably, battery compartment isn't sealed and leaks water in. Based on what I have seen and the other reviews here it would be a mistake to buy any Rain Drip product as their standards for product quality seem very low."
3,Too much verbage,"The title is misleading. It doesn't address anthropology as I thought it would, but rather goes in depth about salvation. I was looking for material about science and the existence of God and instead I found it was a collection of articles about Lapsley .Is it a Christian book, or is it secular? There's so much verbage in this book that it's hard to tell what they're saying half the time. The most confusing parts are when they're using all those five dollar words to describe salvation, and when they equivocate on the meaning of salvation and other related terms.It seems that, in order to read this book, you must also be familiar with some obscure article written by Lapsley on salvation.After a bit of sifting, you may, as I have, been able to find some enlightening spiritual truths, and it is one of the few sources I have found discussing Martin Luther and bodily functions.Students at seminary may enjoy this type of academic material, but I found little use for it."
5,works!!,"must have , more reliable syncing if the flash is expected to be relatively close to you. no batteries required, works!"
5,Very nice vest!,I bought this for use as a Halloween costume. I didn't want to buy a $5 vest and throw it away after the parties so I figured I'd invest a little more and put it in my truck afterwards. I got the vest quick and it worked great. It's comfortable with the adjustable side straps and the inside pocket was handy to hold the wife's chapstick. <grin> No complaints.
2,"Weak vocals, and a tad off-key","I purchased both this CD and the 'One Size Fits All' album. Although all the songs were interesting and fun to listen to, the vocals on 'The Nylons' were weak and a little bit off-key. I was disappointed with the album. BUT, the 'One Size Fits All' album was much crisper and the voices were much better blended and in-tune on all the songs. Given a choice between these two, the 'One Size' album obviously 'Fits All' I expect in vocals and a cappela singing...I'd suggest you consider that one before this one."
2,hard to start book,"i have read a couple of his other books and loved them ""the Good Book"" and ""The Scandalous Gospel of Jesus Christ"", however this one i'm having a hard time getting into and i'm not sure why."
3,different fit from the old days,"I was SOOOO excited to get my Docs but when I put them on, this UK 7 was NOT the same as my old UK 7 from over 10 years ago. They fit more like what I would consider a UK 6.5, even though there is no such thing. I can only figure that this is because these are made in China and not England like my originals. I got the pink tartan, and while I do like them they look a bit like wellies (rain boots). They are really really stiff, whereas my old Docs did not have any break-in period. I have yet to decide if I am keeping them, because I fear the UK 8 will be too big. Just for reference, I am a women's 9.5-10 (US men's 8) and a solid 41 Euro size. I wish these were more like a standard Euro 41 than a bit smaller than that."
5,Love them!,"I had to go over a year without my black Doc's. It was agony, I love these boots. Once they are broken in, they fit like a glove. They last for years, unless your dog gets ahold of the ones you bought 6 months ago. The boots are sturdy and well made. Great for hospitality work unless you need non skids."
1,"Made in China, pity!","I have worn Docs for about 20 years, with a long pause in which the boot manufacturing was outsourced to fricking China. Do not believe the apologists who say that the quality has not changed - it has! Imagine a piece of cardboard that has some thin, cheap leather glued to the surface and you can imagine what wearing a pair of these new boots are like. I bought a pair off the internet, and as I was not able to feel them beforehand, was sorely disappointed with them and even more so when the leather cracked after the first month of winter and allowed water to seep in.Nostalgia aside, I did wear the boots long enough to remember the feel and texture of the leather when they where made in England, and it is nothing like the 'leather' used now. Such is the way of the world now - pay more and get less, and have absolutely zero say about it. Sad."
4,Dr. Martens,These boots are so cool and go great with Cargos. They go amazing with snapbacks and skullies. They also go outstanding with and vests and any color beats by Dr.Dres. You can rock them with birthstone necklaces.These boots are so stylish and swaggy.
1,poor substitute,The new Dr. Martens are not worth the money.I got a pair as a present and within three months they fell apart literallyThe stitching came apart and the air sole leaked.Very poorly made product but what can you expect in this new age of profit over quality.I ended up ordering a pair of 8 eyelet solovair's from England and couldn't be happier.The order was processed quickly and the customer service people were in constant contact until I recieved the boots.Be aware that the break in time is considerably longer as it should be.Be prepared to pay for quality and you won't be disappointed.
1,Poor quality,I have ordered this boot several times and for some reason the ones I just got are already falling apart. The sole on one of them is splitting. I don't know if it is just defective but I have emailed Shoemania and are hoping they will replace it with a new pair. I have always been please with Dr. Martens quality in the past but I am very disapointed this time. My husband wears these to work and has for at least the last ten years. Hopefully this is just an isolated incident.
1,Avoid!,"My first pair of 1460s lasted 8 years of near constant abuse. Heck they are still wearable, but the leather is looking really worn, and they aren't as comfortable as they once were. Two years ago, I picked up a new asian-manufactured pair and wore them only intermittently, maybe a couple times a week to a couple times a month. They did not become attached to my feet like my first pair. I rarely wore them in the winter this year. After two years of minimal wear, the weld cracked, causing the outsole to pop off between the heel and the balls of the feet. Whatever happened to their touted goodyear welding? This is unacceptable, and Dr. Marten lost a customer until their manufacturing standards return. There are better shoes out there you can spend your $100+ on.I heard Solovair makes what these guys forgot to make in the quest for the almighty GBP/$. I will check them out the next time I got some cash to spend on boots."
2,Great if you want the classic DM look...,"however, if you are looking for the original ""Made in England"" Docs these are not it. I just received my Made in England Docs today and let me tell you, they are far better constructed. The leather actually feels like leather, it is stiff but with a little break in I'm sure this will subside. I have always owned the Made in China version before this and they serve their purpose of about 1 to 2 years of life and then throw them away. If you are looking for a boot that will last, spend a little extra money (only about $50) and get the real thing."
3,"Crappy quality, nice design","These boots are alright. But for the price point they have terrible construction. The product description states that the sole is stitched to the upper, which is just not true. I had these for about a year when the sole became unglued from the upper. A good quality leather boot should last more than a year. They are stylish and comfortable, though."
2,Not thesame as they were,These boots look like Dr martens but the are not the same as they were.To get the real quality dr martens make sure they are made in England.The ones that are not are not comfortable and easily broke apart in7-8 months of wear.
1,DMs are no longer DMs get Solovair,"I have worn DMs for years but no longer. I bought a couple of pairs three years ago and later discovered that they are now made in various locations in the East and as a result they are without question sub standard. Further to this, surely it isn't ethical for an English standard like DMs to be taken away from the people who made it great, but then that's business...isn't it? I now wear Solovair 8 eyelet boots. These are made in Northampton, England by one of the companies that made the original Air Cushioned Soles for DMs, they also have the fully welted soles which DMs do not. In a nutshell, if you want honest, best quality made in England air cushioned soled boots like the original ones you can remember, then you need to buy Solovair."
1,Awful,"These boots are not what they used to be.If you want a comfortable, durable, work boot then do not buy Dr. Martens. Now that they are made in China, they are uncomfortable, especially if you are standing on concrete all day. They are made from cheap leather that wears and scuffs quickly and easily. They are also over priced.However, if you are into spending a lot of money for a fashion accessory, maybe these boots are for you."
1,Insole WILL NOT last,"Ok, whether or not these are now made in China (doesn't surprise me), even when they weren't, the insole did not last. Every pair I owned (at least 5 different pairs/styles) the insole rapidly deteriorated, separated from the shoe, and collapsed into the ""air"" sole, revealing the small edge of the inside of the outer sole. This edge protruded into the shoe. It was quite painful to walk with this rubbing against your toe. Shoes were great as long as the insole held together, which was about 10-30 days."
3,Lost the painted flowers,The boots was beautiful but in few days they lost their painted flowers in the ankle showing a white surface
4,The Toes of these Hose are roomy. Color choice depends on size.,"I have purchased other brands of support pantyhose and am happy with this brand. The toe material allows for wiggle room. That may not be what you are looking for if your sandal strap doesn't line up with where the toe texture line changes. The graduated support is firmly present, including at the thigh. I do wish Futura, related to 3M, would return to a former waist band material which was taller and more generous. Bending over for exercise should be encouraged not confining. Also, in size ""Large,"" only one color is available.That color is ""Nude"" not ""Beige."" I know about color choice because I called the manufacturer. Nude is considerably darker than beige and does NOT look like it will lighten up with each laundering. Size Medium does come in Beige."
3,Elegant but ...,"These shoes are really something, the design is certainly different and unique, but I'm not fascinated by the materials and also it runs small, up to one size smaller than normal."
5,great workout,This work out is fun and easy to do. There are no funky dance steps or confusing steps. I truly enjoy it
4,Great Workout CD,"I love this workout. I lost my old one and I was glad to see they still sell it. I lost 20 pounds in about a month (diet and exercise). Karen created a workout that uses every part of your body, and I never felt healthier afterwards. In two weeks, I was addicted and I can't wait for my dvd to arrive so I can start again. My abs, arms, and legs looked amazing. Best of all, Karen isn't annoying and perky and doesn't have that annoying techno music, so if you are into that, then this video will not appeal to you. However, if you just want someone to kick your butt, it is."
5,It works...,"I got this tape in 1995, then moved overseas and it got lost. I couldn't find it in the shops and am delighted to find it on-line, hurrah! The bottom line is; this tape works."
3,This video is not very tough!,"Karen Voight is the one that makes this video worth it. Elle Macpherson doesn't look very gymnastic... And the video is just for those who want to start with some excercise, but after 2 weeks, you need something harder!"
2,Solid tape but Elle ruins it.,The workout is okay but I immediately urned off the the stupid comments by Elle MacPherson. The workout gets boring after just a few uses. I thought it was highly overrated.
5,My Favorite Tape,"I love this Tape! I find Elle McPherson and Karen Voigt to be very motivating - the sets are incredible and Because of the lengths of the intervals I can always tell myself, It will only be a minute more if I get too tired. I have had this video for 2 years now and It is one of the few video's I can always get myself to start and finish - Plus it includes individual sections to tone each part of the body. This video may be to light for people who like to work at advanced cardio levels"
4,Good to change the pace,"Karen Voight really makes this tape. I bought this tape because of all of the hype that was surrounding Elle Macpherson and all reviews saying that this wasa a good workout. I find this tape is excellent for easing back into working out. Don't get me wrong, it is a challenge but after I while it gets a bit easier. The tape has Karen Voight leading Elle through a circuit of cardio and toning.The sections vary between cardio and toning and the exercises are easy and fun, things that don't require a bunch of equipment.Elle Macpherson is a pain in the behind. Her comments were irritating and distracting and I wanted to reach into the televison and smack her silly. At times I thought I saw Karen Voight roll her eyes at her. If you can ignore Elle then this is a good one to own for lazy days."
3,A good book.,"is a product worth buying.Found nothing to discredit the purchase. It was exactly what I expected.Yes I recommend to anyone who likes the same kind of activity I do.Sportsman, rocker and good about life.A good book. Although there are other more complete."
3,Brian from Hull,"This book is generally designed to help a beginner for Biblical Hebrew grammar and syntax. Although it may be intended to reduce a time for researching all Hebrew reference grammar and syntax, the its usefulness can be questioned. Firstly, it is not an exhaustive index. It covers only 14 references before 1996 including 7 English written references such as GKC (Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar 1910) and IBHS (Bruce K. Waltke and M.O'Connor. An Introduction to Biblical Hebrew Syntax 1990),which excludes 'A Biblical Hebrew Reference Grammar by Merwe, Naude and Kroeze in 1999.' Secondly, it only has an index of Biblical passages, not an index of subject or Hebrew word which is useful in Biblical word studies and exegesis. Therefore this index may be for a first-year Hebrew grammar student but certainly not for a postgraduate student who need a serious comparative research training."
3,Not good enough!,Paul Kimmage has made himself the protector of cycling values. The book is well written with a lot of background info on cycling and the tour de France from a cyclist that was there. A good read throughout.However i think Mr Kimmage was just never any good as a cyclist and even his use of doping products did not make him any good. He then stops cycling and in pursuit of his career in journalism proclaims himself the Knight of cycling virtues. He was also a doper but cant forgive any others who confessed to doping. I think Mr Kimmage is unfair in his condemnation!
4,Understand the pain & suffering of professional bike racing.,"Written in an easy to read, conversational style, Rough Ride highlights the experiences of one Irish rider as he joins the professional peloton. Although written in the 80's (with a recently added epilogue) the book is still topical, as he covers the temptations of doping to enhance performance."
1,"terrible, negative book","...this author is so negative; yes, a doping problem exists in cycling. No, we don't need this sour apple to spell it out for us. Every sentence in the book is bleak, painting a terrible picture of professional cycling. I kept asking myself, if he sucks so much in racing or hates it, why does he continue? No wonder no other teams would give this droll, morbid guy a chance. Reading it made me feel dirty and hopeless, losing all confidence in the sport. Have the author's efforts helped the sport any? Of course not. Armchair criticism and whining does nothing to improve anything. Just what does runny diarrhea down Greg Lemond's leg have to do with the story? He should be ashamed of himself (Paul Kimmage)."
1,Paul - Shame on you!,"Reader and potential reader of this book, please note the following:From Feb 13, 2009 Los Angeles Times:""In a strongly-worded radio interview last September, Kimmage said the sport that welcomed back Armstrong was heading backward and took a swipe at cancer survivor Armstrong's passion for the cause of raising money for cancer research.'This guy, any other way but his bullying and intimidation wrapped up in this great cloak, the great cancer martyr . . . this is what he hides behind all the time. The great man who conquered cancer. Well he is the cancer in this sport. And for four years this sport has been in remission. And now the cancer's back.' ""Paul, your pettiness and hatefulness is pathetic. Next to Lance you are nothing. As a cancer survivor I proudly were my yellow and continue to be inspired by Lance everyday - guess that' s too much for you to understand."
3,"Not bad, a little dated","If you enjoy the sport of cycling this is a brief look into it. I enjoyed the sections about the not-so-classic races that decent pros need to ride to earn a living; too often we only hear about the Tour or the Giro. If you are expecting great, edge of your seat writing, it won't be found here, you'd be better off with ""The Rider"" for that."
5,Incredible and captivating read!,"Incredible read from a middle pack world class rider.Paul lends great perspective to all aspects of the doping issue along with self assessment, challenges, and realizations.If you want to comprehend the pack mentality not the super star this is a well written perspective.Kudos to Paul as this book would not be a well received nor accepted admission in his elite world of cycling."
3,"A good try, but use this book with caution.","Based on my 20 years as a medical oncologist/university faculty member, I find this guide acceptable with reservations. For example, this book was partly out of date on some treatment issues the minute it reached bookstores -- a common problem in medical publishing -- and now is even more out of date. The book is OK as a dictionary of medical terms, a tolerable overview of treatments and basic cancer concepts, and a reasonable quide to other information resources. I disagree with some of its tips for dealing with chemotherapy and radiation and, in several areas, the book made recommendations that I consider unwise. Unless you really are a ""complete idiot,"" double check information with your oncologist."
5,Tomb Raider Covered in Dust,"Heretic 2 leaves all other third person and first person shotters/action games in the dust. Heretic two has great graphics and gameplay. The enviroments and people are also verry interactive. By the way the system requirements are wrong, you NEED a pent 166 w/ hardware acc(2meg),pent200 reccomended and 32 megs of ram, 64recc"
2,Limited game play.,I don't know. Perhaps the Heretic II I've purchased is a prototype. I ran around on the scene. I removed the opposition. That was 'bout it. I couldn't leave the initial scene.Honestly: I don't think the game contains any more. BOO!
4,A touching tale,"For a grown man it's almost embarrasing to admit it, but I sometimes had a hard time holding back the tears while reading this book. A very touching tale indeed.This is the story about a girl born in a time very different from now. The family lived a life with much struggle and hardship, but they also seemed able to enjoy the good things in life with more sincerity than most people nowadays.A recommendable book, and a good reminder of what really matters in life."
3,It Was OK,"I liked reading about his life and the journey it took him to get where he is today. It's hard to believe what black people had/have to go thru because of the color of their skin. But, after saying that, I didn't get any inspiration from the book. I think people love Ophrah so much that they will love any book she does. It is a fast easy book to read, though, and I did like it."
3,Disappointed,"I don't care for this man's view of life. I was a bit surprised at some of the things he said in this book. I much preferred ""Kahala, Growing Up in Hawaii"" by Laurie Birnsteel to Poitier's autobiography."
1,The Measure of A Man - A Spiritual Journey,"Mr. Poritier star shines brighter for me after reading this very well written book.His words and thoughts came together into a sincere tribute to his parents, his own moral fiber he brought to his craft, his strong will, and that character does count. I sincerely believe that the world is a better place because of men like Mr. Poritier -- with a voice that speaks softly and loud enough to form a message that translates univerisally.I liked this book so much that a purchased a few copies of the audio version for friends. Sincerely Susan Hutton"
4,Behind the Mystery,"I was intrigued to read that Sydney Poitier was almost illiterate. He explains that he is a self-made person, which clarifies why Mr. Poitier stands heads above his fellow actors. The lesson he learned from his father that ""the measure of a man is in how he treats his family,"" is deep yet simple to understand. It is a lesson both sexes could learn from. A good read for a soulful glimpse of the mystery behind Sydney Poitier."
3,A little difficult to follow at times,"I enjoyed the first third of the book, but at times found it difficult to stay with it til the end. While I applaud Mr. Poitier's spirituality, his writing technique seemed a little over my head. I was unaware of his background so I found that part of the book to be the best."
3,"An ""okayish"" book","I had high expectations when I picked this book. Quite frankly, I am dissapointed because I didnt get the story of a man I have admired for breaking through Hollywood at a time when it was not easy for black men to make it in the film industry.However, I do totally agree with his assertions about the measure of a man."
2,"Nice man, wandering story...","I had to force myself to finish this book, simply because I didn't want to waste my money by leaving it when I was tempted to. It was interesting to realize that an actor whose work I had appreciated came from such a spare beginning, but by halfway through the book, the continuous wandering asides and disclaimers of the author so overwhelmed the narrative that I could barely tolerate it. It seems to me that the story could have been told to greater effect with half the words!"
3,Good insight into the human psyche as well as Poitier's thoughts,"I enjoyed most of this book just because Poitier had such a simple life as a child. I respect his work as an actor so it was interesting to compare his roles with what I expected of him as a person, and adding a little bit of knowledge about his young life. Loved the sound of his book as it was reflective of the personality that I have seen interviewed. I especially enjoyed his general comments about human relationships, growth, and belief systems. I could relate to all of that quite well. Thanks for your insights, Mr. Poitier. A book worth taking in!"
1,disappointing,"I actually bought three copies of this book. The book wasn't holding my interest from the start. I never put a good book down. It was also strange that Mr. Poitier felt the need to use so much foul language. Although I admire Mr. Poitier so much, I couldn't seem to get what the purpose of the book was about. This is only my opinion. He is more than obviously a phenomenal actor. I have always had an extremely high opinion of him. For me, I just didn't gel with this book.And I feel sorry that I sent the book to others as a gift, without reading it first."
2,Great man; poorly written account of his life,"I could not finish it, and, with all of Oprah's hype, I thought it would be so inspiring. I read about 1/3 of the way through it, and the story jumped from idea to idea with no substance in between. Big spans of time were jumped over with little explanation of how he got from one point in his life to another. He was a dishwasher, and then he owned a restaurant and was married with two children. He hints at interesting topics, but never develops them, such as his reference to meeting with the army pyschiatrist and the event that led up to it. Neither topic was developed. I never even understood the little story of why he tried to get himself killed in the ditch that was near his childhood home. Maybe the book just needed a better editor!"
3,"A little disappointing, but also inspirational","Before reading this book I had a lot of admiration for Sidney Pottier. My respect and admiration for him has grown as a result of this book, but overall I expected more. At times I found this to be a little slow, but I would still recommend it to people who want to know more about this historical figure who has been the focus of both controversy and praise. He has certainly overcome some tremendous odds!"
3,MEASURE OF A MAN does not measure up,"Wow, a book about Sidney Poitier. An outstanding actor with a book that just does not give him true justice. The reading tends to be dry and lacks substance. His life struggles could have been the story of any man or woman, black or white. The writing and editing are weak in some sections.You should rent or buy one of Poitier's movies instead. His movie roles show his true skills."
4,A good read,"It was an enjoyable read. This book is really down to earth and written in an honest fashion. I would recommend this book, and have recommended it to others already and their opinion was the same. The book is worth buying."
3,The Measure of a Man,"Although not very exciting, the book is a very interesting read. I was surprised to know that Sidney Poitier did not have much formal education, but he still found the strenght to want the most out of life."
3,A Long Read (Listen),"My husband and I listened to the CD version of this book during a long car trip. I am a fan of Mr. Poitier's work, so I was excited to listen to it. The first several chapters were fairly interesting as Mr. Poitier discussed his early life. Then he goes on to discuss his points of view on things, in relation to his experiences. After that, the topics became repititious and long-winded. By the last several chapters, I couldn't wait for it to be over."
3,Good context but not well written,"I enjoyed the anecdotes Poitier offers of his life, but I had a difficult time reading his writing. Most of the time I felt like I was muddling through it and trying to pick out his ""spiritual"" contemplations. His points were not always clear and I felt that sometimes he rambled. Other than that, it was an interesting read."
2,A Spiritual Auto,I thought the content of this book was much less than I anticipated---a very superficial book
3,disappointing,I love Sidney Poitier. I think he is an amazing man and actor. I expected to be underlining passages in the book to read again later. I don't know if I was expected too much or what but I thought the book was very dry in places. I had a hard time finishing it.
2,Found it rather hypocritical in prose,"The book states on the cover that is is a spiritual autobiography. Mr. Poitier speaks of his high values and morals, while at the same time using offensive languange throughout. I felt that Mr. Portier's life experiences where based upon strict family pride, I could not see any outstanding spirtuality other than a man trying to do his best in making life choices as most of us attempt to do. I did not find this book remarkable or extraordinary; lest spritual. It was a fast read, yet not due to it's excitement or interest. I just wanted to get to the point that gave it the title of ""New York Times Bestseller"" - Possibly because it was recommended by Oprah Winfrey? It's very disheartening to spend the money on a highly recommended book that turns out to be untouchable to the soul."
1,Not the page-turner I'd hoped for...,"I stopped reading less than half-way through. I get it,Mr. Poitier,you were a victim of racism! There was little else this book had to offer and I got bored silly once I realized it was going nowhere other than racial issues. How in the world does Oprah pick her book selections? This is the second time I've been thoroughly disappointed by one of hers. From now on, if it says ""Oprah's Book Club"" on it, it's going to alert me to select something else. Like at least one of the other reviewers, I was totally put off by the author's use of ""ya know?"". It just seemed, ya know, so ridiculous."
3,I expected more....,With all the hoopla about this book I expected more. This was pretty mediocre as far as I was concerned.
3,Only skims the surface,"Because of my long-standing admiration of Mr. Poitier on- and off-screen, I purchased this book ""review unseen."" I wish I hadn't. Mr. Poitier's observations about his life seem superficial, or perhaps his self-admitted lack of education prevents him from articulating his beliefs fully. Therefore, it comes off as another platitudinous New Age call for accepting the spiritual in one own's life, without really sharing the rigorous sef-inquiry this demands.I did find interesting Mr. Poitier's deep attachment to the lessons of his childhood. Although they come from very different climates and backgrounds, Mr. Poitier's and actor Peter O'Toole's autobiographies share the same reverence for being of a certain place, and of being shaped by that place and its values.As compared to the O'Toole books, however, Mr. Poitier shows he was fortunate to have writers to create his words for him when performing."
5,Fascinating life!,This book tells about the unbelievable life of a great person who overcame many obstacles on his way to success. It is really worth reading.
5,A Poignant & Spiritual Autobiography...,"""When childhood is aborted, it's like aborted grief. In both cases, if you don't go through all the stages, giving each its due, the job never gets completed.""Sidney Poitier's autobiography is one of the best autobiographies I've ever read. It has a gentle, lilting quality to its prose - but a powerful impact. His life is a true testament to the worth of God in your heart, goodness in your soul and the will to persevere. I recommend it to everyone!"
3,A Hard Read for me,"I had a hard time reading Measure of a Man. Yes, I know it's one of Oprah's favorites, but I can only say what I feel. I like Sidney Poitier very much, always have and always will. I just got the feeling that he might of written the beginning and the end and somewhere in the middle someone else wrote it. I didn't find the need for the oversized words that were used in the middle, this is why I have this feeling. When he wrote of how he grew up, it was written in simple language, and the ending I felt the same. The saying he wrote of: Prepare for the worst and hope for the best, I wish I had read years ago. I guess, living my own life, I always hoped for the best first and now at the age of 65 am having a hard time making ends meet to live on.I wish someone could answer my question. Did he really write the whole book? Or was there a ghost writer somewhere in the middle?Thank you.Rm Lamatt"
4,The measure of the man,This book is a transcendent experience... Sidney manages to take the reader/listener back in time and grants one the ability to see life through his eyes.namaste!
4,Candid Autobiography by an Icon,"I found this to be a very candid autobiography by this icon. He was open about his heritage and about the injustices that were meted out to him by a restrictive and racist society.I enjoyed the stories about life in Cat Island, Nassau, Miami, New York and Hollywood. A great portion of the book is very introspective. On the subject of children Poitier writes about a post war generation raised on the pleasure principle, and finding themselves bored, resorted to sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. (177). He makes an interesting point that children take pride in knowing that they are contributing - they need a sense of pulling their own weight(179). Don't we often see this depicted in the Nanny shows on TV?Although he felt the rage inflicted by society, he found alternative ways of dealing with it, which were not self-destructive. Today many in the acting business can stand on his shoulders as he certainly stood on the shoulders of those before him.Thank you, Brother!"
3,LOVE THE MAN; THE STORY LACKS PASSION,"I got the feeling that Sidney was holding out on us in this book. He states some of the facts of his life and tells us some of the facts about his family and moves us along as he discovers the world is not always ""fair"" ~~ He tells us things but I never got the sense that he was really ""sharing"" his heart; in fact, felt he was protecting throughout. I never felt any passion in the words and turned the pages just to see if maybe the passion was in the next chapter. Mr. Poitier commands my respect for what he has been able to give me with his talents and I will appreciate him always for that. I just want him to know it is okay to share your heart. It is really all we ever have to share with each other and when we hold it back for any reason, the person it is held back from just knows on that level deep inside. Doesn't mean I don't appreciate him."
2,"Um, what??","I found this book to be incoherent, rambling, and generally incomprehensible. It's the kind of book where one can read a paragraph several times and not have the slightest idea what the point was. Although Poitier's life story is certainly interesting and inspiring, he is ultimately an actor and NOT a writer."
2,Disappointed,"I am toward the end of ""The Measure of a Man"" by Sidney Poitier. As much as I love Mr. Poitier, I am disappointed with this book. I agree with Diane24, Mr. Poitier is holding back. I've gone from page to page hoping that he will reveal more of his experiences as an adult and child on a more personal level. He has left out some important things that his fans want to know. I'm sure he did that intentionally. I hope that in the future there will be a book that will reveal more of who he was as a struggling actor, as a husband, a father, etc. I still haven't finished the book, but I am close enough to the end to know that I am disappointed that Mr. Poitier didn't go in to more detail about his actual life. I thought the book would be more revealing. Instead he analyzes and summarizes everything and everybody else. I still have great admiration and respect for him. He is an amazing man, nevertheless."
5,Service,Customer service is very important to me. The merchandise arrived timely and in excellant condition. Thanks
3,Disappointed,"I was quite disappointed in this highly touted book. I tend to judge a book by asking myself two questions: Did I learn something worthwhile? Was the book memorable..will I remember it long after I've read it? I did learn about life in the Bahamas during the time of Mr. Poitier's childhood, and that was the most interesting part of the book for me. But then I kept looking for the gems of wisdom and advice that I thought the book contained, and found nothing new here. Work hard, follow your dream, don't give up hope, provide well for your children, respect your parents, etc. are themes most of us are familiar with. While I admire Sidney Poitier as a talented actor, I found his writing to be average. Thus, the book will not be one that I remember well."
2,Was not allowed in facility,"The book was a great book (had read it previously), but the place it was mailed from was not allowed in the facility that it was sent to. They have approved vendors and sadly that vendor wasn't one of them. So it was never received by the person I ordered it for."
2,Total Disappointment,"I didn't find any ""spiritual"" revelations in this book. There are many four letter words that I wouldn't expect to find in a ""spiritual"" book. He only skirted on his early years and hardships as a child. Poitier has been one of my idols. I have seen every movie mentioned in the book. I liked him much better before I read the autobiography. I bought it because it was Oprah's suggested reading. I would say ""save your money"" and enjoy him as the actor he is."
2,disappointing,"While the title of this book appears to be an uplifting story of a poor black man from the Bahamas, it truly is a story of a man who is still carrying a grudge over the racism of the 50's and 60's. He is a wonderful actor and accomplished much in spite of the state of our country during those turbulent times. However, he has made a wonderful living in our capitalistic society and should take pride in our country and his fulfillment of the ""American Dream."" As for taking care of his family (his words to describe the true measure of a man) I was disappointed to learn that he left these beautiful children and their mother for another woman. There's the true measure of some men!"
5,A most excellent read!,"I love Mr. Poitier's style of writing and loved the fact that he actually shared his innermost feelings and his spirituality with me. That's a very personal thing. This is a most excellent read and even though I haven't finished the book as yet, I already plan to re-read it. Thank you, Mr. Poitier, for sharing your life with us!"
3,Reflection...,"Sidney Poitier has written his autobiography, which made the New York Times Bestseller list and Oprah's Book Club. I am a huge fan of the actor, Mr. Poitier whose movies I watch over and over again...never tiring of his superior acting. However, I liked the book...but it was not a page turner for me.I am glad that Mr. Poitier lived to the age that is typical of reflection. Reflecting upon his life and legacy and being able to share with the world in his own words. The most memorable sentence that will remain with me long after reading this book is on page 181, ""The measure of a man is how well he provides for his children"". That one profound statement is one that I agree with 100%.If you are a fan of this respected actor, I encourage you to support this book. As I stated previously, I liked the book even though it is not a page turner."
3,Measure of a Man,"I read the book. Not impressed. Sidney spends an uncomfortable amount of time bashing American society. Yes, the 50's & 60's had alot of prejudice and bigotry. That was to our shame and disgrace. But, let's not forget, Sid, that YOU LEFT that 3rd world dump you hailed from because there was no opportunity beyond water carrier on the entire island. YOU LEFT Cat Island because YOU WANTED better than what it had to offer. Where o' where did you go?? HERE!!!! AMERICA!!! THAT'S WHERE!!! America, predominantly white America gave you a life of fame & fortune. A life that could only be imagined from the view of Cat Island. Let's remember that, ok? Did America also make you feel unloved and disrespected? Yes. Again, that is to our shame as a nation. I think, however, the blessings you've received from this ""hateful place"" FAR out weigh the negative parts. Don't you agree??"
4,spiritual journey,Mr Poiter was mesmerizing...I could almost hear him reading the text to me. His spiritual journey and his life experiences made me think about my own journey. It was most interesting to see his some of his more famous films put into the context of his life. Not your ordinary autobiography.
2,try being humble,Very disappointed in this book. He was a favorite of mine. I wanted to say boohoo all through this book.
3,Great actor,What a life this man has had. Seemed more like he was writing it for therapy than for me to understand him.
3,Interesting,"This book offered a lot of insight into a person I was not too familiar with, but interested in, at any rate."
4,Sidney Poitier...awesome man!,"I have loved Sindey Poitier's work ever since I seen him in ""To Sir With Love"", when I was a teenager living in North Dakota! It has been exciting to read his book. To be able to read about how he grew up as a child, with loving parents, to his adventures coming to the states as a very young man has been exciting. The trials he has gone through all of his life were hard, but yet all of the experiences that he and his family have had will always be remembered by them; and by all of us who read his book. I am sure that even though times were tough he and his family are stonger and happier because of them; as they have brought them to where they are today, together living happily in this wonderful land that many of us take for granted. God Bless Sidney Poitier and his family!I would have given this book five stars, but because of a word that was used in the book a few times I chose to give it a four."
4,A Glimpse Into Life of Poitier,"The Measure of a Man: A Spiritual Autobiography, by Sidney Poitier is a wonderful look at his life over the years. Coming from poverty, Poitier became one of the most well-known and well-loved actors in the world.Poitier describes his early years and family life, and how that helped to shape him into the man he is. His father told him that they measure of a man is how he provides for his family. When Poitier came to America and decided to pursue his dream of acting, he had to go through a lot of racism and persecution. Even from those he worked with. He details how he dealt with it and how his upbringing affected his outlook. Poitier had tremendous integrity when choosing his roles and didn't compromise his values.The Measure of a Man: A Spiritual Autobiography is a powerful look at Poitier as he shares his beliefs and convictions that he continues to attribute to his parents. As one of my favorite actors, Poitier provides an interesting account of his life."
2,A Little Boring...,"I bought this book with the best intentions of loving it because I have really enjoyed Sidney Poitier over the years. Unfortunately, the book isn't as fascinating as the movies he stars in. There are moments in the book when you think, okay... here is a story but then it falls flat. The book has a feel of your grandfather telling you a story and then forgetting halfway through what the point was or even the rest of the story.I have only read half the book because I can't find a reason to spend anymore of my time to read it. I might not like the book, but I still love Sidney Poitier!"
5,Brilliant story of a wonderful person,"This brilliant story of a hard and amazing life of Sydney Poitier is one of the great stories of American culture in the 20th century. A brilliant story of one mans sturggle with race and Hollywood in the formative years of the country, through the 1960s and 1970s activism and controversy into the 1980s where he became sort of an 'elder statesman' of African-American actors. Poitier has been in too many films to mention but is best remembered for his role in 'Guess whose coming to dinner' and Mississippi Masala as well as 'Sneakers'. A brilliant and wonderful read that will warm the heart and bring tears to the eyes.Seth J. Frantzman"
4,Poitier - American Dream,"""Measure of a Man"" not only tells about the life of Sidney Poitier, it reminds readers about the importance of following dreams. Anything can be accomplished by anybody. If you think the cards are stacked aginst you in life and there are obstacles in your way on the road to achieving success then maybe you need a little inspiration from Mr. Poitier who most likely had a much tougher mountain to climb than you do. The book comes across as honest and genuine. You don't feel like you're reading about someone who was famous, just someone who struggled to find his place in the world, just like the rest of us."
4,a man comfortable in his own skin...,"a fascinating review of Sidney Poiter's life from his own perspective..a spiritual journey revealed almost as the man is sitting across from you telling his story in a slowly, revealing story..peeling off layer by layer, as an actor would in developing a role, Mr Poitier reveals that the true test of a man is in the devlopment of his character and not letting life dictate to you what or who you are.."
2,"Good, but some serious problems","The game play was good, but there were some serious gaffs. For instance, if you shoot both of a mech's legs out, it should fall over, not blow up. Also, if you disable a mech by knocking it down, the game should not force you do totally destroy it before the scenario is over. You can't get any salvage from something that explodes. And salvage, for a mercenary, is highly important. The original version of MechWarrior knew about this, why not in this version? Some other ""fun"" problems are where it doesn't let you decide how many mechs you can take on a mission. If you are the Merc company commander, you should bloody well be able to decide how many you want to bring along. There are also some scenarios that automatically destroy the legs on your lance mates before they even move. All in all I stopped playing the game due to the problems and felt that it wasn't worth the money I spent on it."
2,ok for tarot,"this book is a little hard to understand if you are buying it simply for better tarot understanding. quite frankly i wouldn't recommend it and regret buying it. it's not bad, but it's almost useless."
2,Good source but a little dated...,"Most of of this book will go right over your head unless you already have a good working knowledge of Egyptian & Greek mythology, magic and esoteric lore of both the East and West. If not, it's a good source for finding out what you DON'T know!It has become dated to a certain extent, but it's still probably the best source if you are serious about the Thoth Tarot. Some of Crowley's information is faulty, due probably to the limitations of the time in which he lived but also to his own ignorance. Furthermore, Crowley writes with an air of authority and certitude that only serves to complicate matters if you aren't able to sort out fact from fiction.To me this book does not reveal anything close to genius as some have suggested. While it does contain a vast amount of information on a lot of different subjects, many of its ideas are not that organized or very well thought out."
4,Consider both books,"Unless you're an expert Crowley reader, you might also appreciate Lon Milo Duquette's Book of Thoth, which aggregates the tables better and explains Crowley's writing in Duquette language -- a definite plus for one not completely attuned to Crowley's prose. But you really might consider ordering both together -- you'll appreciate from time to time looking at Crowley's original explanation which Duquette references."
5,Highly recommend,"One of the best books I've come across explaining what a food is good for such as it's nutritional value and how to use it. I am new to eating organic and this is helpful in learning what to look for in everything from nuts, grains and herbs to fruits and vegetable. Highly recommend for anyone interested in organic eating."
3,Very Informative,"Over the last few years, I've slowly become more and more organic. I've made the transition and I feel great! This book was one of the key elements that allowed my transition period to go smoothly. It's very informative and also a makes a great gift to a loved one, or friend."
4,Das gekaufte Buch ist in der angegebenen Zustand angekommen,"Das Buch war in gutem Zustand, so wie in der Werbung geschrieben war. Ich bin zufrieden."
3,It needs UPDATE!,"This was a very nice book, however, written in 1997. In a rapid progressive space like optical network, this book quickly fells into legacy and can only be rendered as college entry-level textbook in said subject. Many new initiatives and tests have been launches and reviewed. Even Rajiv's new exciting micro-mirror technology (of Xeros) is not covered, not mentioning tunable laser application in mesh architecture. It was a five-star book until mid-1999. In spring 2000, I can only give a honost three-star rating as an encouragement for the author to update his book. It is overdue!"
3,Playin' It Cool Timothy B. Schmitt,"I purchased this CD, Playin' It Cool by Timothy B. Schmitt to listen to him play some music that he writes and performs. I offers some older contributions, but is not all that cool."
3,One good song and the rest filler.,"There is one good song on the whole CD. I bought it because i wanted a clear copy of ""Playin it Cool"". If you want that song then buy the CD, otherwise don't bother. His first CD was his last because, well, one good song."
1,lost in trans,"after purchasing this product, i was never contacted about when or if it was shipped. i was sending it to a relative as a surprise so i couldn't ask if they had received it. i still have no idea what happened to it. i can only assume since i was asked to rate it that it did finally arrive. but, who knows!? needless to say, i will not order from this seller again."
3,"Not very ""User Friendly""","I have been using this product for about two weeks now and I do enjoy the information that it contains. However, I must admit, that I am not very computer savy, so therefore this product is a little difficult to learn how to navigate. The ""help"" fuction does not assit me that well, but it could be due to ""user error."" I would reccomend it to someone that is more computer literate than I, however, to others, I would not. The good ole reliable paper Bible is the best source for me."
2,Do not waste your money!,I thought this product would be great due to it's many options but i was mistaken. The plastic (purple) attachments are so flimsy that you feel like you might break them by putting then on and taking them off. The mini shaver only works with longer hair. The other two trimming attachments do not trim well...they are too dull...even many tries at the same area does not work.Do not waste your time or money on this!
1,Always Breaks,I have purchased this item 3 TIMES. It always breaks! I only use it for the bikini trimmer attachment.. nothing else! The last time i charged it and it just didn't turn back on. I only used it 3 times. I would recommend the Remington Trimmer that is just a bikini trimmer. But then again this one will only last about a year. UGH. ITEM SUCKS!!
5,Remington razor,I am pleased with the timely arrival of the razor. This was a replacement item which I could not find locally. I was pleased to have found it on Amazon.
1,"Was once a good product, not sure what happened","I bought this trimmer 4 years ago and used it almost weekly until it finally died on me. For the majority of the time I had it, I could use it 3 or 4 times before needed to re-charge it. It was a low-hassle product and I expected nothing less in puchasing a replacement.I went to the store to purchase another, which worked once, then wouldn't charge or work again after that. I figured it was a fluke and brought it back to the store to exchange for another. It worked on and off for the last couple months... I think I've maybe used it 5 or 6 times (having to charge it after each time) and now it won't charge at all. Bummer. Good thing I've recently started waxing... an expensive option, but I won't be buying another one of these trimmers to waste my money on."
1,I HATE THIS THING!,"The worst thing about this product is that you have to charge it for hours just to get it to work a few minutes. They could have at least made it so that it would work when it was plugged in, like most other electric products. This will only work if it's fully charged, which takes forever.I used to have one of those trimmers that cost about $10 at Walgreens, it ran on one AA battery.....I think I'm going back to that.Save yourself the aggravation and stay away from this product."
3,short-term shaver,"I've had this for over a year or so, and it's now dead. It stopped recharging completely and the motor has slowly been dying for a few months now. It served its purpose up until recently, trimming well enough for what I wanted. I never bothered switching the attachments, although I did try the shaver once (useless!!). I'd really give it a 2.5 if I could, but I have it the benefit of the doubt and rounded up."
4,Looking forward to the next edition,"I like the book, the layout, the typeface, the structure, the organisation, the extensive index and especially the command lists inside the front and back covers.So why only four stars?The book actually contains a lot of mistakes and although generally very good there are areas where there are obvious errors which have not been corrected.In some sections the logical flow of the material is broken and we seem to fall from one command into the middle of another. As bedtime reading this made it very hard work. As a reference manual it has already helped me sort out some problems."
1,Picture is deceiving,"I ordered this and paid for expedited shipping. It came in a very timely manner. However, I was surprised to find out it does not contain the actual flags. I realize the product description states ""Flag Football Belts"", but am not sure what good the belt is without the flags. The pictured showed flags, so I thought that was what I was purchasing. It would be better to put a note ""Does not include flags"".I don't see an issue in returning them, but wanted to at least provide a review so others don't make the same mistake. Thanks"
1,Buy anything but this book,"Neil Wilson's book is unbelievably boring, redundant, and lacking of useful information beyond a few paragraphs. I have read other books that condense the useful navigation information in this book into a single chapter. Just pick up any Hiking & Backpacking guide and you'll see what I mean. And with only one chapter in this book dedicated to tracking, I hardly see how this book got it's title. Please don't buy this book!"
2,There's just not much here,"In fact, there's only a single chapter on tracking, so let's just call this a navigation handbook. Okay, and the navigation info is very dryly presented and repeated. So I'm not saying this is a worthless book, but it's not all that great. (And for a final point, it's also bizarrely organized.)"
2,"Apple's flagship 15"" notebook with a $20 LCD display","Before you purchase this notebook online, you really owe it to yourself to walk into the nearest AppleCentre to see if you can tolerate the LCD panels used on this system. In contrast to the 17"" model of the Macbook Pro, the Macbook, as well as numerous PC laptops, the 15"" Macbook Pro comes with a LCD panel that exhibits very visible ""grain"". This ""grain"" is especially visible on solid colours and when viewing photos. Both the 15"" and 17"" Macbook Pros have also been found to come with LCD panels that are only capable of displaying 6 bits of colour (certainly not in the ""millions"").If you are happy with spending $2.5 grand on a laptop with a display that is par for a $900 Dell, this laptop is meant for you, but if you do need a good display for your work, you would be better served switching back to Windows and buying a PC laptop instead."
1,danger- prepare for trouble ahead,"i am actually writing about the powerbook 17"" models made in the W8 shanghai factory, which are experiencing a major screen malfunction about 14 months after purchase. there may be no evidence yet that your macbook pro will develop a problem, but apple is clearly not making the quality products i have known and loved since the 80's.worse, they are refusing to acknowledge the problem hundreds of us are experiencing (to see images of our screens, visit www.crosspond.com) and just deleted most of our posts on the apple discussion boards. those who can afford the $800+ repair are even experiencing defective replacement screens.presumably you will be safe- i think apple won't consider a recall because they no longer sell powerbooks- and i don't want to rain on anybody's parade, but at least buy extended coverage and check to see where the product was made. good luck!"

1,Item received other than ordered,The Apple MacBook Pro was advertised as refurbished and with Microsoft Office. It did not contain Microsoft Office and had to be taken to an Apple service center to be repaired. I returned it for credit two weeks ago and have not heard from Amazon.
2,"so much potential, such bad acting","what a disappointment. this film has a lot of potential - lesbian filmmakers, lesbian actors, good concept, passable script, artful black and white - but just can't deliver in the acting and editing departments. while it's wonderful to see women like us positively depicted onscreen - and there should be more of this - it would be great if they could act, too. the script's witty dialogue, while sometimes a little too preachy and unrealistic, is decimated by the actors' lack of skill. the actors' obvious awareness of the camera is also a big problem, as are the confusing, artsy segues between scenes. the editing also leaves a lot to be desired - many transitions are awkward, making the story feel disjointed. if you wish to support lesbian filmmakers - and you should - purchase or rent this film. but don't expect award-winning or even good performances."
3,Check Amazon.de,For those considering this translation: you can get this same work in the original language vastly cheaper at Amazon.de.
1,At What Cost,$83.20 No Thanks. The author probably kept wonderful records of great value to the Duetche U-Boot Museum. Hopefuly any (?) proceeds get routed to a good cause.
1,Piece of Junk,"I paid that much money for a piece of cardboard and some sticky aluminum foil. The instructions didn't tell you exactly how to fold it. it did not tell you how to attach it to the kite. I can't believe it has the Smithsonian Institutes name on it.Seriously, this is not an exaggeration. All it is is a thin piece of cardboard and a shinny sticker to stick to it."
1,Disappointing,"I ordered this book because I had very much enjoyed the author's book, ""Spider's House"" and expected something along the same lines as another psycho-thriller/mystery. ""The Beach Road"" was terrible. The chapters were way too short and the overall story and characters extremely depressing. It was annoying to try and follow the characters as the story jumped from each terse chapter to the next to a completely predictable ending. I had to struggle to finish this book and hoped the story would improve, which never did. In all fairness, I understand this was the author's first published novel and Spider'S House came along later. Read Spider's House instead. Hopefully more of her books are more like that one."
1,I Hated This Book. I would not Recommend it to Anybody.,"The majority of this book was boring. With the exception of one incident on holiday, it started off slowly and concentrated on school yard bullying and family problems until a (very) brief bout of excitement at the end. I do not recommend this book."
2,Tales of Hoffmann,"Another dance picture, which I collect. I really don't like the film, although the reproduction is fine and has some good moments. DVD arrived promptly and as advertised. No complaints there."
5,Tales of Hoffmann,"Truly worth the premium price, this is a gorgeous recreation of a fascinating movie I had not seen for over fifty years. The restoration and transfer are beyond reproach, and the movie itself is even more interesting and engaging than I remembered. Extras are first-rate, and this is a welcome addition to the Powell and Pressburger Technicolor collection - did any producers do better and more pioneering colour work on such modest budgets. It might even be worthwhile seeking out ""The Elusive Pimpernel"" and ""Gone to Earth"", which I have never seen..."
3,Offenbach's opera on the big screen,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Tales of Hoffman directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, is based on Jacques Offenbach's opera of the same name. It is about a poet who reminisces about three women who he was in love with.The film is adapted from the opera very well and has some great scenes.The Criterion DVD has some fine special features also.There is audio commentary by Martin Scorsese and Bruce Eder, an interview with director George A. Romero who talks about how seeing this film with his grandparents as a child inspired him to make movies, a short film adaptation of The Sorcerer's Apprentice directed by Powell, a photo gallery of production designer, Hein Heckroth's drawings, a gallery of production and publicity photos, and a theatrical trailer.This a great DVD edition and I recommend it."
1,Buy this if you like 1930's opera productions,"The production values in this are circa 1930's. It's almost a joke it's so bad. The lead tenor sings flat, the lighting is like something from a horror movie, the sound is ""enhanced"" monophonic, and it's not worth the $12. Skip this and buy something else. What a disappointment."
1,Terrible quality sound,"Tales of Hoffman. Purchased one copy with poor sound. Then bought a second copy with terrible sound. Returned them both and I'm still waitingfor my refund. Have you ever heard of something called ""Qualiity Control""?"
4,"good, but expensive","It is a good purchase, but if you add the cost of shipping, taxes, conversion to region 4 and the product itself, I payed about 100 dollars for it."
5,This is awesome!!!,"This book is full of creative, imaginative ideas! For anyone who wants their grandkids to do more than just watch tv and play video games, you must get this book!"
3,OK book but seen better,"It has good ideas and variety. I found it to be to wordy before and mixed in with the how to parts. Also, some ideas referred to a previous one, which was good, but would have been better if added as a continuation or a variant instead of several pages apart. I will probably redo the ideas for my own personal use and easier reference. This book has stimulated memories and ideas. It is worth having. Those wordy fillers are useful too."
2,"yeah, no","i have to disagree with the previous reviewer who thought this was a great compilation, and have to be honest saying i'm not a big fan of concord jazz recordings. i thought this comp would change my mind, but didn't. artists include: jack mcduff, poncho sanchez, mongo santamaria, jeff linsky, and gary burton to name a few. burton's Poinciana is the strongest track in my opinion. the rest of the performers i would consider ""middle-of-the-road"" performers. blue note and 32 jazz recordings have stronger compilations that will get ya goin' in the morning. and the cover, it looks like the model is posing in a furniture sales room. and who puts on their shoes while holding a cup off coffee!"
1,Material is based on SMS 1.2 very little 2.0 material,"Screen shots, and technical details are primarily based on SMS 1.2, very little SMS 2.0 detail and content. I am very disappointed, the title of this book misrepresents the content. I would not recomend this book."
1,Thanks for all the online reviews. Saved me some money.,"After reading all of these reviews, I believe I will wait for the MS Press SMS 2.0 Training Kit. I don't want to learn SMS 1.2 and it sounds like that is mainly what this book is all about.Thanks readers and keep on reviewing."
1,Study Guide? Don't waste your time.,"I would return it if I could, but the book was bought for me to read before we owned SMS 2.0. Now that we have it I am amazed at how many of the screen shots in the book are from SMS 1.2 and have nothing to do with the newer version. How can I trust anything in this book?"
1,Don't Buy This Book,"If you have money to waste and want to learn about SMS 1.2, then buy this book. It promises to have CBT on the enclosed CD and the CBT is for SMS 1.2. IN addition, the ""interactive"" website that ""has"" all the practice questions is still under construction or does not exist as far as I can tell. Please don't waste your money - especially if you are looking to learn SMS 2.0. They are very different."
1,Do NOT buy this book.,Unless you want to see screen shots that do not match up with the real product. I am sending my copy back.
1,Do Not Buy!!!,"If they only had a 0 star rating!!!! This book is a fraud, it claims to prepare you for SMS 2.0 and the certification exam, but consistently bounces between 1.2 and 2.0 features with know documentation on which is being discussed. Even when it appears that SMS 2.0 is being discussed the facts are not correct, even for Beta 2."
1,The Worst Misrepresentation Of A Subject I Have Ever Seen,"This book has almost nothing to do with SMS 2.0. MAKE NO MISTAKE. If you are looking for a book on SMS 2.0, this is not it. If you are looking for a book on SMS 1.2, this book is still not what you want. Why, you may ask? Well, now that SMS 2.0 is released, books on SMS 1.2 are going to be much cheaper that this book is. I am going to call the publisher as well as Amazon.com to let them know that their attempt to be the first to offer a book on SMS 2.0 can be misconstrued as FRAUD. I am assuming that this was just an error in judgement and not an attempt to make a quick buck at the expense of professional people who depend on the written word to advance themselves and their industry in whatever particular field of expertise they are in."
1,This book is a joke,This book is NOT I Repeat NOT about SMS 2.0 most of the screen captures are of SMS 1.2 as well as the the information. I can not belive someone would publish this trash.. Check the SMS sites and you will see I am not alone in the review of this book.Even the info on SMS 1.2 is weak..I wish I could give this joke a rating of No Stars
2,It's not what you expect,This book (based on the Beta version from SMS 2.0) don't cover what you want. First manny things are still based on the 1.2 version of SMS and the pictures in the book are 90% from SMS 1.2. I have read this book and have waste my monney.
2,New to 2.0,"I have never worked with 1.2, and am implementing 2.0. Eager to find 2.0 resources, I bought this book. Although it is a little help with the overall concepts, I am unable to apply many of the commands and techniques - they are for 1.2. I plan to continue looking for another 2.0 book."
1,I agree to be careful with this one.,This books seems to be a great study guide until you actually see a copy of SMS 2.0. This books has alot of illustrations and examples of how SMS 1.2 works rather than 2.0. I don't feel this book is worth it for the 2.0 exam.
1,This Book is Bogus,This book was written with SMS 2.0 Beta 1 or earlier. The retail product is nothing like what is described in this book.
1,I feel cheated,"This book claims help you prepare for exam 70-086, and to allow you to support SMS 2.0. This is a false statement because a majority of the screen shots come from version 1.2 and there are inconsistencies in the writing.I bought the book because it was the first one out, but realize now what a mistake that was."
1,"Should be called ""SMS for Dummies""","...because only morons would buy it. SMS 2.0 comes with a book on SMS 2.0, and it was written by the people who made SMS."
5,Gives good insight into the realm of Microsoft Systems mgmt.,Gives good insight into the realm of Microsoft Systems management. A very strong perspective on this kind of software.
4,A good starting place,This book is a good starting place for those who need to develop and in-depth understanding of a complex product set. It sets a foundation of understanding of concepts and processes and provides good examples of how to best use complex functionality.
5,What's all the fuss?,"I actually read past Chapter 1. It appears that the author was writing about a version of SMS between 1.2 and 2.0 Beta 2. There are references in every chapter of the book that indicate that this is the case. It's quite obvious that this is not an SMS 2.0 book, since the final release of SMS 2.0 took place two to three weeks prior to the book being published. It's also quite obvious that Microsoft changed most of their screen shots with the final release of SMS 2.0. Probably unknown to the author, publisher and Microsoft reviewers (who reviewed and certified the book) that this had happened, it was too late to do anything about it. So what's all the fuss about? I understand that this happens in the trade book publishing world all the time. I applaud author, publisher and Microsoft reviewers who appeared to have made a valiant effort to publish the latest information on SMS that was available at the time this book was written!"
3,Cleans but does not remove film,"This is average cleanser for Shaw laminated floor but once it has film build up, we don't know how to remove it. No one told us about this film when we were buying."
3,Good but,"Need good pressure on the line to full make use of them, they dont wheart so well well have to repalce the in a year or 2 and I only use them during the summer/spring to boot.."
5,Very solid hardware,"I have Rain Bird impact sprinklers and in ground rotary sprinklers that have been in service for 18 years running on lake water and they are still going strong! These brass impact sprinklers work great and are hard to kill. I run my sprinkler pump at 30-40 pounds and I get plenty of coverage. My 18 year old impacts and my new ones look about the same and they work the same! Thanks, Rain Bird."
3,Shania's Start,"I think this CD was a really good CD for Shania Twain to put out as her first CD. It shows her in a different light. I now know that she has a wonderful voice without it having to be edited. If you get to here this CD I think it will make a huge impact on you, showing you Shania's true and talented voice."
1,Not for country fans at all,"I was very disappointed with this cd. All the songs are 80s pop-type tunes. When I purchased this cd, I bought it on the assumption that it was advertised as ""For Shania Lovers, Complete Your Collection."" Hello? It's not even in the same genre as her current musical style which is Country or Country Pop. I am kicking myself for buying this cd and now I can't even give it away - no one wants it!"
3,Shania rocks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I was pleasantly surprised by this CD. I was expecting to hear cheap sounding songs but they're not. My favorite cuts are ""Its Alright"" and ""For the Love"". The rest are ok but I'm still glad I added this to my Shania collection along with her 3 other albums.At least these ""demo songs"" have been remastered and cleaned up. I bet more artists would allow their earlier stuff to be released if they were assured it would sound good. I'm just glad that Shania went with country pop instead of the dance/lite pop she performs on this CD."
1,Pretty bad.,"It's funny how Shania's career has come full circle, as we can hear in these super-cheesy, independently produced, demo-tape-y synth-pop tunes, recorded in the late 1980s, when it seemed her greatest aspiration was to be the next Tiffany or Sheena Easton. Well, a decade or so later, that dream came true, as the post-millennial Twain returned to her prefab pop roots. Anyone who thought Shania had ""sold out"" by ""going pop"" owes it to themselves to check out these early tracks, where nary a twang is to be heard. It ain't country, but then again, neither was she."
5,Cheesy but hints of the future are here too,"I have to wonder if there's videos to a few of these songs..This is one of those CDs that people who have Y Kant Tori Read and Alanis' pre Jagged Little Pill CDs in Canada, but my opinion is for a demo is that it's above average. Shania and pre-fame collectors will love this.You have to keep in mind with late 80s what was on top 40 radio was Expose, Taylor Dayne, Heart, and Whitney Houston, there's little hint that she would go country, but the ballads and a couple of cuts do give clues into the future."
3,Great Stuff!,"I bought this cd expecting it to be awful, but I actually really enjoy over half of the songs. It's nice to hear a more raw sounding Shania, and I think some of these songs really show how powerful her voice can be. So if your open to a different sound from a different time but with a familiar voice, than this cd is for you."
3,Early Recordings,"Serious fans are only recommended to buy this album only if they'd like to hear shania's sound before she became famous.This cd was not formally released by shania herself but rather with the old record company who had these songs.I can honestly give it 3 1/2-4 stars solely on the basis that this was shania's early writing days and she was just working at what she liked best:songwritter. But for those people that have heard her multi-million selling albums, don't expect to hear a sound close to any of that which you'd find in her 1990's album releases. But if you ask my opinion, my favorite song on here is ""It's Alright"", the club mix. As a serious fan, i had to get this release just to hear earlier recordings. So like mentioned before, this is not new material and is not to be compared to Madonna (or let alone, another artist) as one reviewer did."
1,The rating scale does not go low enough,"The rating scale does not go low enough, so I gave it 1 star. Vocals are horrible! I read someone else comment that she did not authorize the release of this CD. So? What's the point? The fact is, This is Shania's actual non-enhanced voice. Save yourself some money and pass on this one. If you want a recording of bad vocals go to your local elementary school and tape the school recital."
4,"Enjoyed it, want to read sequel","Never read anything from this author before, but I have to say I liked the style of this book. Main character drew you in and you just liked the guy, felt his pain and were cheering for him in the end. Interesting characters, a little suspense and a little romance."
2,Our hero is not so bright,"But he shares traits with early Chandler/Hammett types. Suckers for a woman. Not terribly honorable. Flexible morality. No real good guys. The author can write, but do I want to read more of this guy Davoren?"
5,Enchanting,"This book whispered and sang about her life. One could smell the rooms in the houses shown and touch the fine furniture, feel the wind on one's face and Rosamunds love for the world she lives in."
2,No Certain Rest,"Never having read Mr. Lehrer but being an admirer of his work on Public Television I had looked forward to this read. Alas, it proved to be a disappointment.This is an uninspiring look at the battle of Antietam and the search for the identity of a fictional officer who died in the battle. Mr. Lehrer's writing is flat and leaden, his tale predictable, and his characters either too obvious to be interesting (Spaniel) or too far-fetched to be believable (the modern Albritten). Though he writes in the third person, he uses his characters to carry the burden of describing the battle, the history and the surroundings in dialog. This results in ""speechy"" prose and wooden characters. Situations move slowly and seem contrived. By the end I was far less moved by what seemed to be a subject of real interest of Mr. Lehrer than I would have been by a straight reading of history, or a book like ""Unto This Hour"" by Tom Wicker."
2,Disappointed,"I wonder if Mr. Lehrer thought about the implications of the ending of his story. I enjoyed the modern parts of it with its descriptive forensic analysis, but the supposedly old part didn't sound old. He didn't catch the nuances of 19th Century prose. And the ending was disappointing. Is he saying that the proclivity to murder is an inherited trait?"
1,A Weak Book At Best,"This book is weak in every aspect. The characters are are shallow, the prose terrible and the story line predictable. It will have you wanting to read ahead so you can put it down that much faster. The main character in fact, figures out none of the mystery. He is terrifically wonderful at confirming all that is revealed to him however. As I was reading this I was astonished that something this bad would be published. Honestly, the writing style is simplistic at best. If you must read this, visit the library!"
1,No Certain Rest,"When I first heard of the storyline I rushed out to find the book. Being a smalltime civil war buff and a heavy mystery and intrigue reader, I thought the book would be perfect. I finished the book very disappointed. The historical angle was weak and the current day drama was very poorly developed. I will use his words...""it never should have ended this way..."""
1,High school character development,The characters were totally fake. I'm glad I read this as a library book because (sorry Amazon) I would not pay for it.You could see the end coming a mile off. I am sorry I wasted time.
2,Cruel surprises,"Lehrer presents two parallel stories, a contemporary American Civil War description of battle events and a modern archaeologist's attempt to decipher those events. (This is a technique also used to much more spine-tingling effect by Beverly Connors in her archaeological mystery stories.) Unfortunately the archy character is an excitable scatterbrain and mere day-dreamer, whose pursuit of the past leads to a cruel modern tragedy. There are passages of incantory violence found in an ""original"" soldier's confessional narrative.Lehrer knows how to plot and has a good premise here, but his prose is jarringly rough, wheezy, and simplistic (e.g., he concludes far too many descriptions with the incredibly lazy phrase ""and whatever""). Of the old McNeil-Lehrer PBS News duo, McNeil is the better writer of fiction. This could have made a chilling short story but it went long and whatever."
4,"Not Just a Civil War Novel, but a Darn Good Read","This is a very interesting novel that captures both the ferocity of the Battle of Antietam and intensity of feelings that people have about the Civil War. Although at times No Certain Rest feels like it was written by an intellectual news commentator for PBS (which Lehrer is), the book is easy to read and the story becomes increasingly intense as the protagonist gets closer to his conclusion. The ending also catches you by surprise. You don't have to be a Civil War buff (I'm not) to enjoy this book, merely a fan of well-written mystery/suspense novels."
5,Wide Open Spaces ain't the only song Susan Gibson wrote,"They have a bunch, CD is just another example of popular music's best kept secret, outside of Texas. Texas Music. It's the best and I'm from Illinois"
2,Not So Much,"Previously, I've purchased other Special Effects hair dye and have been absolutely pleased. Cupcake pink did not live up to my expectations. This color is very pale on my naturally dirty-blonde (now bleached) hair. The color came out like a baby girl pink and quickly fades. Not much rinses out in the prelim rinse which gave me hope, and it didn't stain my skin as other colors have. Unfortunately, I find I have to redye it every week to hold any color.If you are looking for a vivid pink that lasts - use Atomic Pink. If you are using this on bleached hair, I recommend bleaching down to pure white otherwise any blonde or brassy undertones will take over. It was also not strong enough a color to go over my natural roots on the retouches."
3,Blah,"This item is okay. The intensity lasted about two days then faded fast, even though I used a shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair."
3,Cupcake Pink Turns Salmon!,"Cupcake does turn a salmon color if your hair is not bleached far enough out and you don't keep reapplying. Bought atomic pink, diluted it and it has much better1. Staying power2. Pink pigment3. ECONOMICAL"
3,"Not too bad, not too great.","I thought this color would be perfect for me, and it was, so no complaints there. It was simple, easy, and harsh chemical free so I was happy.HOWEVER;It took multiple tries to apply it over my already bleached hair. It took a total of three tries, even then the color didn't take, so, I am not fully satisfied with my purchese."
1,this is the worst piece of junk I have ever bought,I've NEVER given a bad review on Amazon - ever - but do NOT buy this item - it was COMPLETELY overpriced - it looked large in the photo - it fit in my hand and it broke the very second we tried to use it - the people who sold it asked how it was and I just didn't have the heart or the time to tell them what I really thought as their shipping was very quick and they were nice but the toy itself was a joke - I wouldn't even call it a toy it was pure garbage...and I've been with amazon 10 years - never a bad review but this toy = BUYER BEWARE - Hasboro should be ashamed of themselves.
2,Too idealistic for a practical peace,I was expecting more. McNamara uses his personal experiences especially during the Kennedy and Vietnam era as an argument for a lot of his arguments. While these serve to give a first hand view of the problems they add little to the arguments presented. The problem lies not as much with the overly idealistic and optimistic desires of the authors but with the lack of any constructive method to reach those ideals. The fact that you want peace and think that if everybody else would commit to wanting peace too then that would solve the problem does not make for a serious discussion of how to bring peace about. In the beginning of the book McNamara says the ideas presented are to spark discussion and debate to bring about a change for a more peaceful world. I don't know if this book adds much to the discussion other than an idealistic desire. I give the book a C- on the StuPage Book Reviews.
5,Pia Toya: A Goshute Legend,"Every child will want to experience the creation story of the Goshute Mountains time and again, and every adult will want to display the simple, yet elegant water colors associated with this story. The story is made more powerful with a description of the small community defining the Goshute Tribe of today and their dedication to natural resources. Readers will find this book to be delightful in presentation, storyline, and purpose."
2,Rating applies to this kindle ebook version only,I've long had and valued a copy of this book. I've been trying to reduce my shelf space by replacing paper copies with electronic versions for my kindle. This appears to be more of an OCR'd version of the book with all the flaws that can come with it. Even the table of contents has numerous random characters and add passages with single characters on a line. Hopefully someone will come out with the digital version of this work that it deserves.
1,WWII B-Movie Propaganda Film,"If B-Movies are your thing don't past this one by. Everything about this film screams made-in-a-hurry, low buget, no name actors, poor story line, etc.... BUT, it is still worth seeing just for the historical aspect - 1943 - in the thick of the war which was still far from certain who'd win."
3,A Mixed Bag,"Petersen's book is a mixed bag. The informaton is very good but, in places, the writing is clunky and breaks from commonly accepted standards (Petersen repeatedly refers to Edward Abbey as ""Ed,"" which grated me.) He has a number of good observations and also brings in some good examples, but, as a previous reviewer pointed out, the book is far from flawless.Peterson conveys an attitude in this book of being 100% right, which is important in an instructional book. In places, however, divergant opinions are just as valid as Petersen's.Basically, if you have an idea about nature (or any type) of writing and want some additional keen insights, get this book. But, when reading it, be prepared to hold on to the ideas of yours which you feel are more apt than Petersen's."
2,Don't waste your money!,"This one was a huge disappointment. I've read Petersen's essays and they're not bad. But in Writing Naturally the prose is clumsy and cliched; the chapters focus on the most elementary writing topics. He makes absurd and insulting suggestions. For example, he advises readers to avoid Thoreau because the ""archaic"" prose is ""a tough row to hoe."" I expected content on how to use natrual imagery for metaphic purpose, or techniques on observation and description. Instead I got a chapter on tense and point of view. He puts down other authors who load their writing books with their own writing, then he does exactly that himself! If you are a beginning writer who needs good, concrete information, I suggest you spend your money on a subscription to Writer's Digest or another monthly magazine that deals with the basics. You'll get much more value for your money!"
3,"Not strong, not fast-paced but actually lovely and entertaining.","If you like crossdressing, you will enjoy the soft Transgenderism presented in this film...Also the film is in good taste and funny."
1,Not at All,"So i am a huge fan of low budget movies, i really am. however i couldnt even watch this all through though.. and i am a VERY big fan of britney so i figured i would love it... yes i took a chance and bought it and its not that i regret it or anything, this movie just wasnt good... the action was horrible and the whole ""documentary"" was very sloppy..and there were only three different costume changes, wtf! i was extremly dissatisfied with this movie...and i recommend NOT wasting you time"
2,A predictable Rock song,"Don't get fooled. This song hasn't anything to do with the rest of the album. The album isn't Rock. Melodies are decent, but Bono... That makes me give no more than 2 stars to this hype.3 Annoying things:1- Mix: Drums are tad low on the mix, lacking power. Overall sound is flat. Jacknife remix sounds better and more interesting.2- Bono: he's really annoying with his ""high"" singing.3- What's the point with this song ?: this tune goes nowhere, lyrics are shameful. What the hell are those yeah yeah yeah ?Listen City Of Blinding Lights instead and throw away this one !!"
1,time for commercial announcements,"a song for sponsors. The whole album is stuff for sponsors. U2 doesn't go somewhere with this song, is a shame to see how U2 has falled musically at the lowest level, something really annoying."
1,YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH,"does anyone rememer who were U2 ? at least the clowns acting and pretending to play like 80's U2 with this ""Vertigo"", NO."
4,"Decent single, but was overplayed.","I loved this song when it came it out back in November, but then the Radio got ahold of it, and it became overplayed. It is is a very good song, it has good lyrics by Bono, semi-great guitar-playing by The Edge, and a cool enterance into the song with the uno, dos, tres. I feel that U2 is one of the founding fathers of Rock/Alternitive, and they are still holding up today. I do not expect them to be in a retirement home anytime soon."
1,A silly song for grammy awards and radio stations,"Honestly, this song is so ridiculous. This song is so empty and snappy simple that is so annoying. U2 have nothing but a wish to buy a new grammy, make much money, to put U2 in MTV once more and be a excuse to continue living of which U2 wsa in the 90's. For worse, many fans keep and will keep eating this excrement, like a fundamentalist do with his/her Gods.Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah..."
2,En un principio puede parecer buena pero...,"esta canción molesta por la sencilla razón que es tan comercial que parece que fuera de todas esas bandas estúpidas de EEUU como Blink 182, Sum 41, etc. Esta canción perfectamente puede ser el soundtrack para películas como American Pie o semejantes.Bono se esfuerza incomprensible e infantilmente en tratar de demostrarnos que puede cantar aaaaaaaaaalto como lo hacía en Unforgettable Fire, con miles de cigarrillos y miles de copas encima del cuerpo. The Edge crea un riff patético, y Adam sólo se limita a seguirlo. Larry Mullen está más preocupado de usar sus nuevos lentes de sol que tocar la batería. El sonidista hizo una labor deplorable, dejando en evidencia que con un poco de talento y mayor audacia musical ( Jacknife Club Remix ) esta canción pudo haber llegado mucho más lejos. Pero no, Bono y sus chicos se conformaron con esta sopa instantánea. De verdad esta canción es basura, sorry U2, los amo, pero no de este modo yeah yeah."
3,Hola,"Sadly, U2 no longer releases singles in the US. And in the UK and Europe, they have this fantastic practice of releasing two different versions of a single because they can't fit it all on one disc. It's wonderful--you get to pay most of the cost of an album to get those two extra songs, a torture for completists.This single isn't bad, and it's a bit cheaper than previous ones, depending on where you get it. Vertigo is a very good single, and brilliantly (and shamelessly) used to market the new U2 iPod, a real pinnacle of corporate brilliance. The song is a bit overproduced, but at least U2 is trying. The cover of Neon Lights is totally random, as they lend the Kraftwerk tune some nice ambience, but it's not essential."
3,Really only worth purchasing for one song,"This CD is of interest mainly because of the Kratwerk cover, Neon Lights. It's a nice atmoshperic song, consisting of a single verse repeated a few times. A good B-side, though, and it's not available on The Complete U2 box set. The first track, Vertigo, is the same as the album version. The Jacknife Lee 10"" Version is a good track, but it's only a shortened version of the 12"" version, which IS available on The Complete U2 box set from iTunes. Compare the running times. The 10"" version runs over 4 minutes while the 12"" version clocks in at 5:36. If you must have every song that U2 has ever done, then buy this. If you are searching for good U2 B-sides, buy this. Otherwise, it may not be worth all the money."
4,"Not Perfect, But A Nice Statement of Purpose","As usual, U2 brings out the passion in people, for better or worse. I think that, like ""The Fly"" and like ""Beautiful Day,"" this is a great declaration of intent. It's not the best song off HTDAAB (wait 'til ""Love and Peace or Else"" and ""Miracle Drug"" for that), but it's loud and ferocious. Bono's in great voice here, and the whole sound is very dynamic and uncompromising. You can nitpick the little touches, but just remember that the Beatles had some odd little squiggles and touches on their songs, too.I like the remix of ""Vertigo,"" for the record. I'm sure I'll be hearing it in my local gym non-stop all winter."
2,Beware of track listing,"First of all, in actuality, Vertigo #2 (at least the one I received) does not have the b-side ""Are You Gonna Wait Forever?"" (which is, by the way, a pretty good song), so make sure that you are getting what . . . uh . . . you are looking for.That said, if you have not heard ""Vertigo"", then you are living under a rock. (Can you say, ""Elevation-Part Dos""?) The Jacknife Lee remix of ""Vertigo"" is OK, as far as remixes go, but is nothing earth-shattering. Finally, the cover version of the Kraftwerk tune, ""Neon Lights"", is atmospheric, but a bit droll."
5,The region FREE DVD will not play on American/canadian DVD players,The reviewer below claims there is a region Free dvd available on Amazonuk. Don't be fooled. It's still in the PAL format and will not play on American/Canadian DVD players. The poor quality VHS is the only way you'll see this film until someone releases it on DVD in this country. Region O in the Pal format still means it's a PAL DVD. Don't waste your money like I did. It must say Region free ALL regions!!!
1,can't work for a living,here is a guy who will not work for a living but can find women who can support him!!! this is not romance. new world away from minethis shows todays america. it is just true and very sad.
2,Why the positive reviews?,"I have seen several hundreds of movies throughout my life and just a few seemed ""low budget"" and linear, with amateur taste taste to it. This is one of those movies.Basically any movie has better anything... Watched it because of the positive reviews...If you have nothing else to watch, this movie will kill your time, but nothing else..."
3,Quirky Movie About What is Really Important,"The movie touches on topics such as what is important in life, understanding other people, and love. It is cute and quirky."
4,cute,"cute movie, kind of a romantic indie film similar to garden state but not as good. good actors and plot but nothing special."
4,"Lovely, indie romance","I decided to give this movie a chance after watching two other Tribeca films, Newlyweds and A Fitzgerald Family Christmas, and noticing the high rating from others. It didn't disappoint. For fans of indie film, cool music, and realistic romance."
2,Didn't meet expectations,This movie was predictable in the worst way. The characters all fell short and the storyline was amateur at best. Random holes throughout the whole thing. Not worth watching.
5,A bit different,This is a good movie. It's a bit different from most love stories and that difference is what makes it worth watching. It's one I'd watch again.
1,Anguished failure,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Hackneyed crap that aims at poignancy and misses, which is too bad, because you get the sense that everyone's heart was sort of in the right place making it, but it's just painfully, painfully bad."
2,No Cigar,"It's like an indie movie by someone who doesn't quite get indie movies.I can't quite suggest it's a spoof of indie movies, because a good spoof can only be made by someone who really gets the target of the spoof. It's more like an embarrassingly bad knock off of a Louie Vuitton handbag. Or a counterfeit $100 bill with a portrait of Donald Trump on it.I wanted to like this movie, I really did. Good actors, great music, solid cinematography. But every dialog fell flat, and the movie just didn't deliver. A waste of 90 minutes."
4,This Giant Mechanical Man has a big heart,"This is a really wonderful story and while not perfect it is for anyone who has ever struggled with not feeling normal, fitting in or feeling alone. The moments that movie allows Chris Messina to inhabit the Mechanical Man are magic. I heard David Russell director of Silver Linings Playbook become indignant when the interviewer called SLP a RomCom. If RomComs were defined by movies like this one (and his) he would accept the definition as the compliment it was meant to be. Loved this movie."
4,Thought provoking and inspirational,"This movie was an excellent pick. It explores the themes of isolation and loneliness that so many people feel in our modern age of materialism and technology. When we focus on acquiring ""things"" and accept the modern false promises and definitions of success, we lose touch with who we are. This movie reminds us of what is real - love, genuine friendship, encouragement, and productive work that gives meaning."
3,Good storyline,"Although the movie had a good story to tell, it was slow in telling it. I wouldn't put it at the top of my ""To Watch"" list."
2,boring and depressing,this movie was listed as a romantic comedy. there was nothing funny about it. It was a dark and depressing movie about to 30 something slackers
