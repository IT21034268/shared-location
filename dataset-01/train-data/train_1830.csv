5,Great DC FUSE for battery system,"I bought this to be a fuse between a set of batteries and my inverter that powers a subpanel at my house for back-up capabilities. The casing and ANL fuse holder worked as intended. I was using 2 guage welder cable with a large 1/2"" ring adapter. The fuse holder had no problems closing down over the connector and wire. It is nice beign able to see the fuse indicator as well to see if I had a problem or surge. This device gives me a peace of mind when it comes to saving my very expensive xantex prosine 2.5 from overloading on the DC side.The cost is low and the feeling of safety is great. The plastic didnt' seem overly cheap and the stainless nuts and washers seemed quality. Very happy with the purchase."
3,Works okay,"I have two of these. They work okay but the covers come off too easily. All it takes is a slight knock and the cover comes loose. Both of mine are ""portable"", inline with power inverter cables and not mounted. I wrap a velcro strap around each to ensure a disaster does not happen."
3,A little weak,"Theses fuse holders are ""ok"" but the cover barely stays on - a breeze like blowing out candles on a cake would likely knock it off."
5,Sturdy,"bought this to use on a 1200 watt power inverter, does what it is supposed to do as far as I can tell as I have not overloaded it (yet)"
1,"Misleading Photo, fuse is not included, flimsy cover","First off, I have to say that I liked what I saw on the listing on Amazon. It looked just like the one I bought as a kit from Crutchfield. When I received it however, I was sorely disappointed. Fuse was not included and, the plastic cover is easily popped off. And it's a thin plastic that seems like it can easily crack with heat underneath the hood (hot/cold/hot/cold etc.)For the cost of buying a separate fuse and going through all the hassle looking for it, I just opted not install one until I see a decent priced one at WalMart or elsewhere. Save the disappoint and go with something else."
1,Left wanting,"I thought this came with an ANL fuse like it shows in the picture. If you order this, be sure to order the ANL fuses you require."
2,do not need for inevrter,If your mounting indoors or a area that is free of water I guess this would be okay However offering it with an inverter is ridiculas as it has to be mounted near your battery box like for us truck drivers. It is better to use a marine grade circuit breaker this way you do not have to worry about the weather
5,Nice design,I used 4 of these in a RV House Battery/ Charging system ....they are very nice and can be tie wrapped to secure the covers better.
5,SCHSCHE EWFH Single ANL fuse Holder,Good quality item and serves it's purpose well. The fuse holder and Raptor ANL fuses were a perfect pair for my application. The fuse holder was small enough to be mounted in my limited space and the connectors large enough to handle to 2 guage cable I used.
1,dont buy from this seller,"I purchased this for over 300$.Translator broke 2 days later.When I tried to contact seller never got anyone to return my calls.DONT BUY FROM THEM. GO to direct website, they are offering good deals.thanks"
2,Not a stroller for jogging,"The Good-~The handle bars adjust so you can find a comfortable height.~The canopy has a large window to keep an eye on the child.~It fully reclines and has a 5 point harness.~The front wheel can lock if you want it to only go straight.The Bad-~When the front wheel is unlocked to turn, it does not turn very smoothly. We have to use firm hands to maneuver it.~The 5 point harness is confusing and takes a long time to do. It takes up to 4 different buckles and hooks to get the little guy in.~It is very bulky and cumbersome to move when folded up.The Ugly-This is NOT a jogging stroller. In the manual it clearly states it is for walking purposes only. If we had known this we would have spent the same amount of money on a stroller that we could also jog with.Too bad hubby threw the box away :P."
4,Great for teaching young children about self protection.,This book was a fantastic way to introduce the idea of self protection to young children. Squeakers is a young sqirrel who is made to feel uncomfortable and threatened by a mole. It is very low key but gets across the message that it is OK to say no to adults sometimes and to tell an adult if someone molests or threatens you.My children love this book and it has inspired many conversations about stranger danger etc.A valuable book to own if you have young children.
5,Looking Forever,My mom and Dad gave me this book when I was about five years old and to this day I remember how much it meant to me. I understood the message even though I had never experienced any form of abuse. I think this is a book all parents should get for their children - it is a great way to let them know they can come to you no matter what and to approach a very disturbing topic - This book has never left me I am so glad I found it again!!
4,Good sound quality,These speakers look nice and have good sound quality. Gave four stars because requires too many batteries.
2,No AC adapter plug! Only runs on batteries!,"Everything I have read about this product on the Amazon and the Philips websites state that the AC adapter is not included but is an option. the Philips website for this exact model number even shows a connector to plug in the AC adapter. HOWEVER, the product I received with exactly the same model number DOES NOT have an AC adapter connector and clearly states that it runs only on batteries! So if you really want to plug your speakers in while travelling (car, hotel etc), don't buy these ones...I returned mine."
2,worked great for a short time only,"I loved this item when I first got it but then it started giving me different readings each time I would weigh the same item (Not Accurate). I would bring it to the post office only to find out that it was a completely different weight than ANY of the weights it gave me! Finally, it got to the point where the Digital Numbers started to FADE AWAY and become unreadable. What a disappointment this scale became to me."
1,Digiweigh postal scale,"Please do your research before purchasing a scale from this company. Many folks, including myself, have had numerous problems and the company is not much help."
5,A Creepy soundtrack to a good movie,This soundtrack is really good. the most spookiest superhero soundtrack i heard. It really fits in with the whole vampier scary movie thing. Make sure you get to check out Blade The lyric soundtrack
1,Looking for a Song from the movie,Does anyone know the name of the song that plays after Blade emerges from the pool of blood in the last few minutes of the movie when he begins attacking all the security guards in Blade 2?
3,A little repetitive,The score was actually allright. Most of the tracks sounded the same but there were some cool beats. Those of you looking for the blood bath music in the beginning aren't gonna find it here.
4,"This is the Film Score, not the Pop Soundtrack [20 bit HDCD]","To all those who are using your reviews as bulletin board messages to find the pop songs from the film: GO COMPLAIN ON THE ""POP SOUNDTRACK"" PAGE, NOT HERE. THIS IS THE SCORE. To everyone else: this is a unique, neo-gothic electronic/symphonic film score. I've never really heard anything quite like it, and it was perfect for the film. My only complaint is it could have been longer with more variation. Most scores are actually much longer than what's used on the film, so I suspect there was plenty of written material that simply wasn't fully produced. Isham should have added some extras for this release."
2,Don't Believe Review # 1 !!!,"Actually, whoever wrote review # 1 is a bit confused. The CD does not contain any of the ""songs"" from the movie! What it does contain is the music that takes place in between the ""songs"". You know- dark, moody sounds, etc. There are no lyrics on the CD, and certainly none of the thumping techno you may be looking for. If you want some moody stuff that played in the background of Blade, this is for you, if you want the more lively stuff, you are better served by going to the ""other"" Blade CD. On that one, I must agree W/ the reviews that state ""don't buy it for the techno"", as only the last 4 songs ARE techno. The bulk of the CD is hip-hop & rap. But I bought it anyway, because the New Order remix of Confusion is so delicious that its worth the price of admission alone. Makes me want to go kill a vampire or two myself! (But please note, you can get the same track on a New Order remix CD W/O and of the other stuff, & I believe its even longer too!). Peace."
3,I seriously need help,"hi, sorry for not writing a review, but I'm getting a little desperate here. See, the thing is, I'm looking for the hardhouse/techno song from the movie, remember the one in the house of pain-club?if someone could help me, please..thanks"
1,They did it to us again.,"Remember all the bumpin jams from the last movie that didn't seem to make it onto the soundtrack? Well, it's the same with this soundtrack. I too was interested in the songs from the 'House of Pain' scene. The good news is that I found them. (That's right, there are two songs in that scene.) The first one--the one with lyrics that begins right when they show all the vampires dancing--is ""Tao of the Machine"" by BT, and The Roots. Run a search on google, I found a downloadable mp3 from some foreign site. The second song, the techno music without lyrics, is ""Blood is Pumping"" by Voodoo and Serano. I hope this helps everyone looking for the GOOD music from the movie. As far as a review of this CD, take a listen to the samples below and see if it's what your looking for, it wasn't what I wanted."
1,THE SONG I WANTED HAS BEEN FOUND,"I wrote an earlier ""review"" about how I was not impressed that the song Frost was listening to on his walkman in the library, was not on the soundtracl or original score. And I was looking for the song, well I received a couple of emails of people who were looking for the same thing, and I couldn't help them, well one of those emailers found the song!! It is ""CALL AND RESPONSE"" by Source Direct. SO if anyone wants to know, there you go!!!!"
3,I purchased the wrong Disc,"I was looking for the music inspired by the movie, not it's actual soundtrack. the songs are OK, but I was trying to buy my girlfriend the other CD, it was one she had and she mentioned she had regretted losing and I tried to do something nice for her and ended up getting the wrong thing. That's not the seller's or the CD's fault so I gave it 3 stars."
3,This wasn't too bad!,"This soundtrack was okay, but the other Blade soundtrack is way better!! For those of you asking about the ""bloodbath music"" it's on the other Blade soundtrack. It's called ""Confusion"" and is about 12 minutes long! It's really awesome!"
3,BackGround Music.,"All right, I enjoyed it because I liked the erie music and the theme. But I was looking for .... the musicor a few songs. What I want to know is .. In the China Town in the bar what were the girls singing and the endin music when the when credits are rolling and they have the BLADE theme music with a tecno mix?? Where are they??"
3,"It's theSCORE, not the SOUNDTRACK, morons!","I'm tired of reading all these so-called ""reviews"" that complain that this is ""not a soundtrack, but a score."" DUH! Look on the front of the CD! Why do you think it says ""ORIGINAL SCORE"" on it? C'mon, try to THINK! All the techno stuff is on the other CD, which is good, but this CD is really good too. It's really moody, scary, and haunting. It's great except for the last couple of tracks which I thought were a bit overdone. It's worth the money if you really liked the movie, but if you're looking for more faster stuff, by the SOUNDTRACK. Got it? SOUNDTRACK."
1,Made in China,"Krups FME2 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker with Glass Carafe, WhiteI've had many Germany manufactured coffee makers over the last 40 years and had no complaints until now. This machine lasted only 3 months before the heating element went haywire. Also have to say that programming is a nightmare and was used only once before I decided it's easier to manually turn the machine on each morning. When Krups decided to have their machines made in China, they apparently outsourced the quality control also. This is my last Krups."
2,Krups Coffeemaker,I should have listened to the other reviews. I also have had many great Krups coffeemakers in the past but this one just doesn't cut it. I am really sorry I purchased it.
1,Very Disappointing!,Very disappointing. We purchased this thing because others in the house are more into coffee than I am and the reviews seemed to be good. The coffee machine never worked correctly from the very first day. It poured hot water every day onto the counter (mixed with coffee yuck! So we took it back thinking it was faulty. The next one did the same thing. We tried different filters than the recommended ones and still the same result and ooey gooey yucky mess.
2,Don't bother,"We swithched from a Braun that died after many years. I had read the reviews talking about the ""bubble"" problem, but didn't understand what that was about. After 6 months of fighting with the small water opening, the bubble in the water measurement chamber and the difficulty of the auto timer feature, I can say positively I will not buy another Krups!Krups FME2 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker with Glass Carafe, White"
2,"This is not the best coffee maker, that's for sure","Drips terrible when you pour, the glass viewing piece that shows the water levels leaks. I don't recommend this one. It's the second one I had, and I just think they are lousy. Wish I had not bought this one. Hard to set the times and clock as well.I'd return it if I could."
1,Toxic plastic smell,This machine was a huge disappointment as a replacement for our trusty ten-year-old Krups. The new one reeked of plastic and made awful coffee. Am currently awaiting delivery of a red Hamilton-Beach coffee maker with nothing but good reviews. Fingers crossed!
1,toxic odor,"I noticed a strong, toxic smell when I first took it out of the box. After washing all the non-electrical components and running a full carafe of water through it, I made coffee with my brand new Krups. The coffee seemed fine...a few minutes later I started feeling sick to my stomach.I'm not a hypochondriac. I really want this coffeemaker to work out. But, is it worth drinking toxic poison every morning?So, I washed all the removable parts again and ran at least 10 tanks of water through to see if the odor would subside. It seemed fine until I turned it on, when the hot steam seemed to coax out the plastic aroma. I'm drinking another cup of carcinogen...I mean coffee...right now. We'll see how it goes."
4,hard to program,This is a great buy and I like the looks of it on my counter. We have one in yellow for tea also. I never use the auto because it is too confusing. The bells are okay not bothersome. No trouble with the handle either. The yellow one does have an extra band to go around with the handle.
2,Air Bubbles in the Water Level Glass,"I purchased this to replace my old Krups. Almost every time I add water, I get air bubbles in the water level glass. This is certainly not as well made as my last two Krups coffee makers."
5,Works Great,"No problems, nice looking, great coffee. Very easy to program, even if the power has been lost for a short time."
2,Krups FME2 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker Difficult to Program,"We had a Krups 12 cup ProAroma, which we really liked. After it died, we decided to try the Krups FME2 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker with Glass Carafe. The Krups FME2 was very difficult to program. The timer was not too bad, but it was definitely more difficult than the Krups ProAroma timer had been. It was hard to determine whether the timer was set to ""On"" or ""Off"". It was almost impossible to set the length of time that we wanted the coffee pot to remain on. It made a good cup of coffee. And the glass carafe was easy to pour and did not drip. But we were still unable to use the coffeemaker for the purposes for which we intended it. We returned the Krups FME2 12-Cup Programmable Coffeemaker"
3,Krups - not as good as it used to be,"I had a KRUPS for years and loved it. So when I changed colors in my kitchen, I decided to buy another KRUPS. At first it looked cool but the white gets stained easy and the quality isn't as good. The glass carafe used to have a metal band around it with a removeable lid. Now the handle is glued on and the lid is attached which makes it hard to put in the dishwasher. The coffeemaker is all right, but if I had to do it over again I would pick something else."
1,Disaster,"I too replaced a wonderful Krups 12 cup coffee maker we had for many years after its recent death from old age. So we bought a FRM2 and it proceeded to leak all over the counter. We figured that the leak had to be a unique problem (We should have heeded an earlier review) and traded for another new one. This one leaked just as badly and for a bonus, the program wouldn't set properly. I have now purchased a Cuisinart DCC-1000 at a comparabele price. It is in my opinion a much sturdier machine"
1,Krups has gone downhill,"Bought this coffeemaker to replace a previous model that was about 6 years old. The FME2-12 was a huge disappointment and I have returned it. Everything about this coffeepot was lighter weight and very flimsy compared to the older model. The carafe on this model (which is the same as most other Krups models) was made of such thin glass that it is at risk to crack or break every time one handles it.I ordered a comparable Braun unit and found it to be much more substantial. From what I have seen most other brands, including Mr. Coffee, are better made then the present line of Krups products."
1,Never even received it!!!!! Pissed off!!!,I ordered this and waited and waited and never even received what I paid for I still want it or I want my damn mOney back!! I'm pissed to the extreme I hate when I pay my hard earned money and I get ripped off !! How f****in rude!!!!
1,"Haven't read it, but this info is readily available and free","The mind boggles at the audacity of this author - how do you turn two paragraphs of readily available consumer information into a 97-page book and actually charge people money for it?If this book helps curb the plague that is telemarketing, then I think it's a good thing, but please be an informed consumer and know that you don't need to pay for this information, nor search far and wide for it.Just type 'telemarketer' in your internet search engine, and all you need to know - a page's worth - will come up free."
5,Breaking Free...,This is a book that everyone who is not enjoying a truly happy and successful life should read. It takes a fascinating look at the dynamics of what makes people successful or not. The correlation between positive and negative executive behavior vs. criminal behavior is intriguing and very well developed. Wareham constantly draws on real characters and real circumstances to make his points with great wit and warmth. I doubt if there is anything out there that even begins to compare to the unique subject matter of this book.
4,A pleasant surprise....a well-crafted 'B' movie!,"This film, despite a garish cover, is really a well-made, well-hidden gem! It begins with the lead character, a vampire named Boya, crawling into a bag in the crawlspace of an apartment building when he reads the news about the moon landing. Twenty-five years later, the demolition of the building wakes him once more.He comes to be friends with a hysterically funny cabbie, whose dreams far exceed his reach, and the lovely waitress at a local coffee shop in a bad part of town.The character studies are exquisite, and the movie, though funny, is tinged with a palpable melancholy, as it follows the lives of people on their way down.Look for David Cronenberg in a cameo role as the local crime boss.Well worth the ten bucks they're charging."
2,"This Vampire movie ""sucks""","one of the worst vamp movies I have seen. It is a complete waste of money. The Story line and acting is just plain dumb. This is probably the 3rd worst VAMP movie I've ever seen (just behind ""I was a teenage vampire."" and the new ""Modern Vampires."" SAVE YOUR MONEY! DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS ONE."
5,Excellent & off-beat vampire film,"Not your typical vampire film. A romantic & conflicted vampire awakens after 25 years and encounters some off-beat, but realistic characters, each with their own foibles and circumstances that are each affected by his presence. Without the vampire, this film would've been different but just as interesting because of the characters that populate it. This movie is, strange to say, almost heartwarming. Well plotted & executed. Fantastic."
4,"The ""Repo Man"" of vampire flicks.","I found this movie extremely entertaining. It was funny and had a strange creepiness to it. Though more of a humorous, than scary movie. It's lots of weird fun. Some of the reviews I read, obviously took it too seriously. I thought it worth watching, with tongue in cheek and an eye for the artsy."
3,A good Game,It's a good game . It's like Pokémon except you collect part to improve your medabot better. I like the Rokusho version better because it use close range fighting .The games OK. I would give it a 3.5 actually. If you just got a Gameboy Advance it's better to order a Megaman Battle Network 1 or 2. Or Pre-order the coolest game ever MEGAMAN ZERO !!!
4,"Good Quality, Great Price","I purchased this dash kit for my Taurus. It was more complex of an install versus some other cars and trucks iv put decks in, but nothing too bad. This is a great quality product with 1 exception, The rear defrost light is bright at night! Once the kit is in, its in. Very solid and good looking. If you need a dash kit, get this one! Iv seen this comparable model at other stores going for over $90!"
5,Perfect Fit,"I installed this today in my Ford Taurus 1997, the only issue I had was that the receiver in this model of car is in the trunk so I had to have all the wires run from the trunk to the dash board for my CD player. Which was rather time consuming but well worth the effort. Other than that it was great and fit perfectly in my car."
5,great product,"this product worked get for a aftermarket installation, very easy to use all pulgs into factory wires and it worked great . highly recommend."
3,Just so-so,"This is just an okay unit. Switches did not transfer perfectly--had to slightly modify fan switch to get it to fit this Scosche unit. The electrical crimped connections were rather poor also--one had come undone already. So I ended up cutting off the crimped connections and soldering all the splices to make sure there would be no connectivity issues. Also, the trim piece (the square piece) did not fit the radio I had bought--wish they would offer more pieces/options to fit a wider range of radios. However, it ended up looking okay. Fyi, I installed this on a 99 Ford Taurus with manual knobs. I recommend buying the din radio removal tools--made it very easy. And just so you know, to do the wiring correctly (since you have plug in the wire harness back at the rcu unit connection in the trunk, it is necessary to remove the back seat and the trim along the left front and rear sides to route it out of the way and hidden, so it's not just an easy r&r job unfortunately."
5,The Best,"The year is 1978. Yeah, you know what that means in terms of music. Disco and all that and real soft pop. Then... comes ""Hearts of Stone"". No airplay to speak of. Johnny breaks his arm right before the Jukes begin the tour behind the album and it sinks. But friends, believe me. This is the best. This is Johnny and the Jukes the way they were meant to be heard (ok except for live in a bar). Essential!!"
5,Rediscovered Treasure.,"It amazes me that this record didn't solidify Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes as a prominent rock & roll / rhythm & blues band.The essence of the New Jersey sound, with a more consistent cover-to-cover swing than Springsteen ever maintained in a single LP.Miami Steve has written a handful of R&B tunes as good as any I've heard, but ""This Time Baby's Gone For Good"" may be the best of them. And the title cut (written by Springsteen) is its equal.The band itself is confident, tight and attacks whenever it needs to. Great horn section, and a better-than-average job by the Jukes guitar players.There's not a weak song on the record.... I can't believe it is so overlooked."
5,outstanding,This is one of the greatest albums I have ever heard. Southside and the Jukes at the top of their game. It will break your heart and make you feel things that you didn't know you could feel anymore.
1,once again wwe stretches the truth the best of the wwf 12,yet another ok volume of the best of set i think the dark match kamala vs santana is good good way to get the fans into actually buying the volumes and the other matches i kind of like orndorff vs george steele and brutus debuting his barber gimmicks against long time former manager i think i used the wrong context for that also the machines vs the heenan family is interesting i always like the concept of the masked men.
3,For the hardcore Fans ONLY !,"This is a great cd , IF you only want some interviews and additional history on Prince and his music. I don't know What another reviewer was thinking when he started comparing the background music on this cd to actual Prince songs when it sounds Nothing like Prince and besides it's all instrumental. NO New or Unreleased songs here!Like I said hardcore fans ONLY>"
1,Should have read the 'dont' be scammed' review first!!!!,"Okay, I too fell for this.....I was under the impression that this CD contained PRINCE music tracks.....NOT just a spoken word, unauthorized audio biography!! Amazon's description should have made this clear, and I would not have purchased this item."
4,Nice product/different finish,"We really like the table, but be aware that the finish is different from the other Bainbridge products even though it's advertised like it's part of a set. It has a silvery metalic paint brushed all over it, so it doesn't look black and coppery like the other pieces. It doesn't look bad, but if you are real picky you might have a problem with it. I have it between two of the chaise lounge chairs with cusions, so it works fine."
4,The Naked Church,"If one has the courage to read while allowing the spirit of God to ""plant"" in your spirit you will say many ""aha's"", you will be saddened re:the evolution of what was begun so gloriously,relationally and with great commitment to a form and fashion that has produced nothing and yet by seeing in black and white, will be encouraged to realize it does not have to be this way. God-help us to be ""quite simply"" just what you've modeled for us to be. Nothing more-nothing less!"
4,Good introductory book to doing church in a relational way,"As I write my own book, Close Your Church for Good I am trying to read several other books that seem to have similar content and themes.The Naked Church by Wayne Jacobsen was one of those books.The book is relatively easy to read, and Wayne had many great things to say about how church has become the way it is today, and what sorts of changes we can make to return to the friendship with Jesus Christ and with each other that should be central to a living and vibrant church.Much of the material was helpful, though I did not agree with everything, especially his sections on miracles and spiritual gifts. However, I really appreciated his chapters on Restoring a Personal Touch (chapters 15-16) as these seem to be some of the main areas where churches today are lacking.If you are looking for a good, introductory book to help you think about how to ""do church"" in a different way, this book by Wayne Jacobsen might be a good place to start."
2,Glenn Y All Time Favorites,Not so good. This album could have been done by any singer; it is not the sort of music that has the eclectic quality of most of GY's work. I only listened to it once and it is back in its case where it will most likely remain.
1,garbage!,"My tiny little Yorkie was able to chew through these treats in MINUTES. AND they make a HUGE mess. I'd give NO stars if that were an option, really. Everlasting my behind, ugh! For what they cost, they should last longer than that, and not make a huge mess."
3,Okay Season 1 Episode Along With The Worst Babylon 5 Episode,"""Born to the Purple"" is an intriguing episode which shows Londo Mollari's (Peter Jurasik) tender side, introducing us to his great love, Adira. Clive Revill is deliciously slimy as the villain Trakis who owns Adira, ordering her to obtain valuable secrets on the Centauri Republic's leading families from Londo. Unfortunately, it is coupled with ""Infection"", a monster of the week episode in classic ""Star Trek"" mode. What redeems it from being as bad as the worst ""Star Trek"" is Commander Sinclair's (Michael O'Hare) philosophical musings on racism and hatred as he and his crew hunt down the alien warrior from a long vanished civilization."
2,"One average, one terrible episode","Born to the Purple is just an average episode, featuring Londo and a rather pretty slave girl who is part of a plot. Its an ok episode. Not great.Infection however, this is a bad one. One of the worst of Season 1. Terrible plot, very obvious Star Trek influences on this one (bad machine reactivates and the Captain out reasons it to destroy it). Remind you of the ""Nomad"" episode? Infection is right down at the bottom of episodes along with ""Grail"". There are many better B5 episodes than this one."
2,I cook for a livin'...,"I bought one of these to travel with 'cause it's light...that is it's downfall. The concept is great but the exchangable blades and cutting blade flex under pressure when you try to cut/julienne big,dense veggies...like myself. This is fine for thin slices and waffle cutz tho.This is a NORPRO so you can pick one up just about anywhere for this pice.I bought a steel mandoline instead of depending on this lightweight.sorry, only 2 measely mojo*z for dis looozer."
2,Not among the best of Ringo Starr's albums,"Ringo Starr's BAD BOY offers three worthwhile songs: ""Hard Times,"" a solid rocker; ""Heart On My Sleeve,"" a from-the-heart pop tune; and ""Tonight,"" in which Ringo delivers an affecting vocal about new love. Beyond that, it varies from so-so to so-what. The production value on ""Who Needs A Heart"" and ""Monkey-See, Monkey-Do"" grew on me through the years, although I wouldn't include either on a best-of collection (and Ringo hasn't asked me to compile one). Ringo Starr's BAD BOY is for the fan who wants to have everything. Those who would like to hear one of his best albums should try TIME TAKES TIME, RINGO, or GOODNIGHT VIENNA; the latter two now include superb CD bonus tracks."
3,Ringo Maniac,As a person who has every one of ringo's albums this one is defenitly not his strongest but it is good for not having any other stars on it (no pun intended) it has a couple good not great but solid songs on it even though ''A Man Like Me'' is simpley the song ''A Mouse Like Me'' from his children's album with the lyric ''mouse'' replaced with ''man'' overall though agood album not 5 stars but definetly not 1 or 2 stars not his best but pretty good.
2,Buy it only if you've got every other Ringo albums,"Giving this CD five stars is pure madness. How many millions stars would you give to the Beatles' albums then ? Really, I'm a hardcore Beatles fan but I've got to admit this album is not the best Ringo made, to say the least. I love ""Lipstick Traces"" and I enjoy some other songs on the album, but what about this ugly disco cover of ""Where did our love go"" ? And boring and overlush songs like ""A man like me"" ? Ringo has done so much better before and since ! Buy ""Ringo"" (1973) and/or ""Vertical Man"" (1998) instead !"
1,The most forgettable Ringo album,"One does not listen to Ringo albums for seering emotion (one would instead listen to John Lennon) or pop craftsmanship (one would instead listen to Paul McCartney), but for fun. Ringo's albums are generally fun. But this album, along with ""Ringo's Rotogravure"" and ""Stop and Smell the Roses"" are dreadful and more boring than George Harrison's post ""All things Must Pass"" albums. Can't even remember a song off it. Either get ""Ringo"" or ""VH1 Storytellers"""
1,dont work with 3500 ram bad solder connections,this might work with gas models but wont work with my 1997 3500 dsl plug for the cruse isnt the right one and the airbag connection had a bad solder in one of the plugs had to repair the bad solder issue and then had to figure out which wires had to go where b4 i could hook up the cruse and in the process i found a shorted connection between 2 wires that i had to fix very disapionted with this product at this time
5,This is a great feeder!,"Have had a plastic tube feeder for Sunflower seeds and I dropped and broke it so was looking for a replacement. I wanted something bigger as I was refilling the plastic tube 1 or 2 times a day. Bought this and it is just the ticket! Loads very easily, holds 5+ days of feed and the birds love it. It took a while as the birds are weary of change but as each hour passed they returned en mass. It is not unusual for us to have 50 birds feeding on the ground, on this feeder, a nijer feeder and suet. I have only had for a week but believe this will last as it is very well constructed. I must say I do not have a squirel probem as there are a number of black walnut trees around they feed on. Highly reccomended as it works perfectly and will not have to clean them at years end, just collapse and put away......perfect!"
1,Absolute waste of money!,"I would not recommend this product to anyone! Within five months, the tv was shutting itself off and on several times a day. The manufacturer told us to upload new software from their site. We did, and the set would no longer turn on at all. We asked them for a replacement set. They said they would send a refurbished or out of the box replacement. (The 1 year warranty wouldn't start over, either.) We weren't too happy about that, but thought it was better than nothing. Three weeks, and a dozen phone calls later, and we still don't have a tv. Customer service has been quite rude and unhelpful, and will only refund our purchase at a prorated rate. You have got to be kidding! ~ I wish we had checked out The Better Business Bureau on this company before purchasing."
1,Quintessential Hypocrite,"Price's rant against white racism (brought on by Kenneth Hagin, Jr.'s silly comments on ""mixed marriages"") has revealed his own bigotry. While watching his weekly TV program, I saw how Price lambasted the white members of his church as guilty collaborators of America's treatment of blacks. This is the same thing as blaming Japanese-Americans for the attack on Pearl Harbor. If the white members of Price's church were bigots, then why were they attending in the first place? The following week's broadcast showed Price chastising his black attendees for harassing white attenders as they left services the week prior! Price continued his tantrums for many weeks--which now constitutes this book. This whole episode demonstrates how Hagin and Price are more alike than different. Ignore the book as you should these two undisciplined, self-righteous teachers."
4,following old scripts,as far as historical content the book is above reproach. Its his plan to correct the problem that i have a problem with. He's just sitting around waiting for them to give us something. He even says the white people of america are the only ones that can correct the problem. He thinks that they are just going to get up and say alright here's the reparations you wanted. I don't think so. He has to be prepared to get up and do something dramatic like run for president or open businesses that black people could run. I'm waiting to see what's he really willing to do when he sees that they're not going to just give us our money without a fight? I believe he would be very successful if he ran for president. Come on Fred go for it! We'll support you.
2,Not Worth the Trouble,"Although I did not go through Amazon for this company, I did order direct from them and found the service awful. First order was lost,2nd order had a wrong item and then no response to my e-mails about the error. Just not worth it. The actual product was fine, service terrible. Maybe going through Amazon would had afforded me better service."
4,Great read for anyone who loves mountains.,"Most ski writers are middle-aged-plus travel hacks more interested in the hotel than the hill. Not Finkel. Almost uniquely among widely-published ski journalists, he's more interested in descents than dinner, and it's fun to travel vicariously through his work.Alpine Circus is essentially a compendium of columns originally published in SKIING magazine. All are interesting. Most are funny. One -- the piece on Sarajevo -- is intensely moving.Four stars out of five. While very enjoyable, the book doesn't fully display Finkel's remarkable talent as a writer. Hopefully, future collections will. You'll see a lot more of his work... he's still a mere sprat."
3,a classic in a ugly new suit,"I had seen an early version of this book, and I thought that newer might be better: it is not. Small print, pink ink on white paper make it very hard to read. Useless large margin make the book much bulkier than it needs to be.The content are good, this book is a classic, but I am disappointed by the new edition."
4,An Overlooked Album,"Many regard this as one of Barbra's forgettable '70s albums, but I think it's a good album of eclectic material. Barbra is in extremely good voice, and many of the songs are quite enjoyable. Who else could turn the annoying ""Tomorrow"" into a sunny and charming vocal but Barbra? Her voice overlays/overdubbing and guitar arrangement are both captivating on this track. Perhaps not the best of '70s Barbra, but definitely worth a listen.(The cover photo/design, however, remains one of least memorable of the album art from her music catalog.)"
1,to be avoided absolutely,"the only listenable songs on this album are the bookends: barbra's delivery of 'tomorrow' is splendid, and the title track, not much of song to begin with, is spared the butchering treatment given the rest; it simply defies comprehension why streisand chose such third-rate material, and then, to add insult to injury, decided not to sing but scream them at the top of her lungs; she is the most beautiful white voice of this century, and i wonder what is it that makes such great voices have to prove they can hit every octave or whatever it's called - understatement is a great thing - just listen to karen carpenter; this, however, is absolutely dreadful, and the cover is horrible too"
3,Simple Speakers,I liked the simple design of these speakers and the way they packed away for picnics and camping. The sound isn't that great. Tinny and muffled so I only gave it 3 stars for that. They're loud enough for casual music since they're battery powered. But don't expect to blast them and have a big party around these little guys.
4,"Great System, but no power input","I bought these after buying a few diffrent travel speakers. these can be used with or without the amp. With or without the amp they are great. These are much better (without amp) than my pair of Sony passive travel speakers, that I just bought. I have tried the plugging my other passive speakers into the amp and it realy gives them a boost. Sound of this system is great for their size. Best I have tried sofar. Major problem is that there is no external power input."
4,Very good sound and value for the $.,"I picked these up at a local 'big box retailer' for about twenty dollars the pair. I needed much better sound for my notebook PC, and man do these deliver! Both spoken sound and music sound very full bodied and clear, and bass is there in good amounts as well. My only gripe would be that when you turn them up loud, the bass starts to distort and clip. But, this is true of most smaller iPOD/notebook PC speakers like these Philips. The unit takes 3 'AAA' cells, which last a long time (I got a few weeks out of mine being on my PC hours a day). All in all, these speakers are quite cute and attractive, and a good value."
1,Can't understand why this got so many good reviews,"I bought these for a friend who watches DVDs on her laptop, but these little speakers go into overload distortion at ridiculously low volume. I wasn't expecting great quality -- these are powered by AAA batteries, after all -- but this is ridiculous. Back they go."
3,Sound and Quality,"These speakers are well for indoors, but outdoors requires more volume. Turning up the volume to max on these speakers decreases their quality. Thus they have the best quality at mid range volume, aka not a stereo replacement item. As far as ease of use and durability it is proficient."
5,Great sound - nice and loud,"These Phillips speakers are a great little set. I can plug them into my laptop in the livingroom and hear great quality sound while I am out on my patio. I actually turned them down because I thought I might be annoying the neighbors. People have complained that there is no AC plug - only a battery. Not a problem if you use rechargeable batteries with the speaker set.I had also purchased the similar Sony SRS P11Q and found them to be awful. I can crank the volume up all the way and still barely hear the Sony speakers. The Phillips are far, far better."
4,"Great little speakers, work without batteries even!","I bought these as something cheap to take outside on nice spring days. I thought they might not be the best, but I've been pleasantly surprised. With the booster on, they get a lot louder than I think I'd ever need them, but without batteries in, they are just fine for most purposes. There is some distortion at loud volumes, but really, for twenty bucks, they are A LOT more than I expected."
2,Can't handle high volume.,"These speakers are nice in that they are portable and easy to carry around, but the sound quality is terrible. You cant turn them up very high because of the distortion. They cannot handle any bass at all."
4,Incorrect Product Description,"I'm not an audiophile, so I can't really comment on the quality of these speakers, but they sound fine to me. However, they do NOT have a ""wall plug for extra power"" as stated in the product description. The only power comes from three AAA batteries. I was looking for something that wouldn't require me to carry batteries around, so this was disappointing. The speakers and power pod do pack together into an ostrich-egg sized unit, so the whole thing can tuck into an odd corner of my duffle bag."
5,Great Overall,"These speakers work very well. I took them to work and the sound fills the medium-sized office, even over the equipment noise. For tiny speakers, the sound quality is excellent. If I didn't like theese speakers so much, I'd give them only 4 stars because they're kind of bulky for carrying around with you everywhere, even in the ""egg"" shape - you can't just throw them in your purse.The battery life is at least 16-20 hours (I haven't had them very long, but the batteries haven't worn out yet) and potentially much longer. As an added bonus, the rubber around the battery compartment even keeps my iPod from moving when I switch tracks or adjust the volume.Overall, I highly recommend these speakers."
4,Nice external speakers for mp3 players,"I bought this item along with a couple of other external speakers in an effort to find a good set to use in my elderly car (speaker system died). This set is not my preferred to use in my car (I use the JBL On Tour - great sound for a small, compact speaker), but I was very impressed with the Phillip speaker sound and use them very regularly around the house. For the price, the sound is great and their portability (pack down to a large egg-shape) is quite good. You can't go wrong with these if what you are looking for is a good sound in a small package!"
1,"fotografy? Come on Kelsey, spell it right.","Kelsey's books can be helpful but his maps are pretty bad, hard to read, and why does he always spell the word photography, fotography? Why not fotografy? Why not just spell the word corrrectly? I would love to know the reasoning behind this, it would be good for a laugh or two around the campfire."
4,A complete reference of an obsolete GUI,"This official set of guidelines for creating Windows-compliant user interfaces was published in 1995, and explains in depth then just released Windows 95. Profusely illustrated and nicely printed on a good quality paper, it seems to cover all the necessary bases on its 550+ pages. It might not be the best lecture ever -- the text is rather dry and gets boring after a while -- but for a reference book that it is, it's hard to point out any serious problems. Even when Windows 95-like interface will be long but obsolete, the book might be a joy to riffle through. International word lists, presenting Windows terms translated to 25 languages, are a nice addition."
2,Interface design advice from Microsoft?,"If you're into following guidelines, this book will suit you. However, since Microsoft isn't especially good at following them, especially their own, take this with a grain of salt. They're the last ones to be giving interface design advice.This book is intended as a reference to programmers who don't want to take the time to familiarize themselves with Windows. I'd suggest spending some time with Windows, and then designing something good. Forget the book."
5,Good reading for everyday.,"Excellent book if you have made Marian Pilgrimage or belong to the Legion of Mary Catholic organization. It helps me remember places I have been to and I am very thankful. Our Lady, Mother of God, plays an important role for everyone. She is our model. Our Lady trusts without hesistation. I also love how all people of the world revere her. She does an excellent job in bringing me closer to her son, Jesus Christ."
2,Confusing and Vague,"Well...MOST of the information is there but you have to hunt to find it as it it very poorly organized. They use some vary strange comparisons to illustrate pronunciation, so if you can't speak German of French you'll just have to guess. Many of the passages are worded so strangely that they need to be reread 3 or 4 times."
5,Great book. . .,"I'm usually not into novels, but this was really a great book. It is beautifully written, and a great story of a family through multiple generations. The perspective of the years leading up to WWII from the point of view of ordinary Japanese citizens was really cool and different. This book is intense and will give you chills and tears...It captures the bitter sweet nature of life and death, the beautiful and ugly sides of humanity, and impermanence. Highly recommended."
5,Beautiful,"What a masterpiece!I read a quarter of the way through, and knew I was on to a sure thing. Hiroko Sherwin, please write more books for us!!!I won't tell you the plot, or give you the full story, you can find it in other reviews. I love learning about Japanese culture, and reading Japanese authors. This is by far and away the best book I've ever read."
3,good book - poor description on cover,"I enjoyed reading this book and appreciated a different perspective on WWII. I was drawn into the characters and it kept me up past my bed time. However, I feel compelled to warn future readers that the description on the back cover is extremely inaccurate. It would lead you to believe that this book follows the ""poignant journey of self-definition"" one one woman. Not true. It starts there, but then quickly moves on to the next generation, and the one after that."
3,Enjoyable!,This book had just the right amount of story and steam. I enjoyed this book and will definitely read more by this author.
1,OUCH!,"The Asics Gel Cumulus VII is the worst running shoe I have had in over 30 years of running. I wear a size 10 street shoe and have always used 10.5 for running. The Gel CumulusVII 10.5 is too small. I have blisters on top of my toes on both feet. I have never had blisters in over 30yrs. I have a pair of Asics 2090 and NB 991 both 10.5 and I use a sorbothane insole in both and very good results. The cumulusVII is too small without an insole. I bought them because they are supposed to be a ""cushion"" shoe, but they provide very little cushioning. They are just all around uncomfortable and I will probably give them away."
3,"brisk pace, vivid descriptions, includes glossary",Humans have an alarming tendancy to involve themselves with powers they don't entirely comprehend. The opening of a massive extention of a mass transit system may cause both it's destructionas well as that of the human race. In steps the Doctor to save the human race from it's ignorance... again
2,Not so great...,"The music was awesome, but the plot really wasn't too exciting and was hard to follow...."
2,Paul is fun to watch...,"Paul is graceful. I hear something good in him all the time.Ringo is explosive but well kept in his drumming scenes most especiallyin ""Not Such A Bad Boy"". I enjoy seeing Linda McCartney in the scenes where she's playing keyboard. I feel a wonderful relationship with the crew and other members of the band as they ride thru each song.Paul is mojo and in typical good form as he sings ""Wanderlust"" then tags at our heart with ""Here, There and Everywhere"".Calm and well kept, I got my own meaning from it. I'll watch it again."
3,He's Paul McCartney and he can afford to do it!,"Let's face it, this really isen't a movie. It's a collection of videos held togeather loosly with a impossible plot. That being said, I like it. The ""Ballroom dancing"" and ""not such a bad boy"" and the sureal ""Elinor Rigby"" video adaptation is worth the ten bucks right there. You should be a die-hard Paul or Beatles fan to enjoy the ""movie"". Not for the fair weather fan."
2,Not such a bad film,"Your new album is due at the record company but the messenger carrying the master tapes is missing. What do you do? Why, sing a few numbers, of course! Sure, Paul McCartney's GIVE MY REGARDS TO BROAD STREET basically kills time between songs. And melody master Paul McCartney turns in a wooden performance, although that kind of acting hasn't stopped Keanu Reeves, to name one stiff actor, from a movie career. But what great songs! How did McCartney choose from so many superb Beatles and solo tunes he had composed? GIVE MY REGARDS TO BROAD STREET's at least worth a look on cable TV."
2,Especially Disappointing in Philadelphia,"Here in Philadelphia, there could have been a slightly ironic pleasure in the name of our town's imposing main drag being substituted with a perfectly straight face for 'Broadway'. We would never have done it ourselves, but having the little play on words come from out of town would have been fun.Unfortunately, the movie is a stinker. Even for a music movie it lacks a credible plot. That old movie standby 'continuity' seems to have taken the day off as well and the less said about the camera work, the better. The music isn't bad-in fact sometimes it's lovely-but I already own this music in other forms and if you're reading this review, I expect that you do too.You'll notice that there are lots of very cheap used copies of this around. That should tell you something right there.Lynn Hoffman, author of the Philadelphian bang BANG: A Novel"
2,It all depends on what you expect,"Broad Street is a relatively obscure project by now, at least by ex-Beatle standards. But in a way that is just as well, since the people who will enjoy this movie are specifically fans of the music of Mccartney and the Beatles, rather than a general movie audience. Taken as a film Broad Street is pretty dull, but so was the Beatles film Magical Mystery Tour. What Magical Mystery Tour did have going for it was great songs with fun psychedelic videos to go with them. Broad Street does not have songs as great as the ones in Magical Mystery Tour (what does?), but the songs that are here are mostly good fun. Even a few Beatles tunes are covered by Mccartney with a studio band. If you go into this movie expecting more of a fun collection of music videos with connected by a marginal plot, then you will not be disappointed. Anyone looking for a good film experience should look elsewhere."
2,"Oh well, at least the music was good.","I saw this when it came out in the theaters. I was a huge Beatlemaniac, like my parents were, so I figured, go see it, it'll be great.Well, it wasn't.The humor was dry and the plot was practically nonexistent.If you are a Beatles or Paul McCartney fan, it's worth keeping around as a conversation piece and to play for your friends for $#!&$ and giggles.Other that that, don't waste your time or money."
2,EL Magical Mystery Tour de Paul,"Más allá de la gran música de este film, ni la perspectiva del tiempo lo salva. Lo más flojo que hizo Paul como solista, junto al LP McCartney II, es ésta película.Quizá para demostrar que nadie es perfecto.Beyond the great music of the film, neither the perspective of time saves it. Perhaps the worst thing of Paul's career, along with McCartney II."
3,For Paul fans,"The Eleonor's Dream section is worth the price of the reantal. It's just a nice movie, don't expect too much. In a way it's kind of sad, because it shows a Paul McCartney who doesn't know if he can trust one of his friends. There is a bittersweet quality to it all."
3,"It was okay, but it had great music.","The story was kind of shady and if there was no music it would of totally lost my interest. But the music kept it up beat and very, very fun to watch. There are some odd parts in the movie that make no sense whatsoever. But the music covers that up. The acting was not that good. But look quick and hard for todays comedian Tracey Ullman. She has a small supporting role. I give the film 1 star for the acting and for the story line and 2 stars for the music which adds up to three stars. If you like Paul and Linda McCartney a lot and are ready to hear music instead of following a plot. This is your kind of movie."
4,Cheesy fun for all true McCartney fans,"WARNING: This movie is not for the fair-weather fan. It's extremely cheesy, doesn't have the greatest plot, and I even fast-forward through parts of it. That being said, I love this movie. It's one of my true guilty pleasures. The ""Ballroom Dancing"" sequence is deliciously over-the-top. As for the ""Silly Love Songs"" sequence...well, it WAS the early 80s. Bearing that in mind, it's interesting to watch. The appearance by Tracey Ulman is great fun, as is watching Paul McCartney beg for money as a busker. I could go on and on, but it boils down to this. If you love Paul, then you'll probably love this movie. If you don't love Paul's music, then you should probably pass on this one."
4,Pretty Nice..,"So I must say I'm a pretty big McCartney/Beatles fan, but to be completely truthful this movie was kinda' corny. But it was nice seeing Ringo and Paul together having fun. It's also nice to see Paul just kind of goof around and sing and dance and all of that good stuff! Overall this movie is pretty good if your a McCartney/Beatle's fan you can appreciate it for what it is, kind of a cute movie."
4,The film is very interesting!!!,"Paul is a genius and the man that composed the essential and style of Beatles's music. The Sargent Pepper album was an idea of Paul and it's more important songs belongs Paul. Macca was the best of the Beatles. This film is not a masterpiece BUT is an interesting film that show us the concept, the idea to make movie in a basic format with sweets songs. The songs are very beautiful and the performer of YESTERDAY is the best version solo than I heard it. ""Bad boy"" is a deliciuos song and ""No more lonely nights"" is a imponent song. I think that when the most important composer and singer of the Rock/Pop's History like Paul McCartney gives his ilusion and work like this film WE must to be happy and glad. THANKS SIR PAUL!!!!"
4,Great at being what is is.,"While this video seems to collect criticism it would seem to me to be misplaced. This movie is a great vehicle for Paul Mc Cartney to play a few tunes and have some fun, not a serious attempt to create an epic. There is a little morality tale about an ex-convict woven into the plot but it still stays fairly lighthearted. The secret of enjoying this movie is to not take it too seriously."
4,It's a great movie,"I love the movie, I have seen it over ten times and everytime that I see it I begin to love it more. Yes the plot is somewhat lacking, but there is one there. And the music is great! I love all of the songs and was glad to see him revive some of the old Beatle tunes too. Also it's great to see Ringo in there. Ringo does a great job himself with the little bit he got in the movie. If you are looking for a movie that is just plain fun to see and are also looking for some really great music, then this is the movie to see. Don't go expecting it to be all elaborous and complex, it's just a fun simple layed-back movie that is a must for any Macca and/or Beatle fan."
5,A musical work of art.,"Paul McCartney really outdid himself in this movie. It was nice to see him and Ringo Starr in one movie together. Performances like ""yesterday"", ""Here, there, and everywhere"", and whatever song was after that-I can't remember the title-are wonderful works of art. This movie is one of a kind and a must-see for any Beatles fan."
3,"If you like solo Paul, 4 stars. Beatlemaniacs will give it 2","Out of rock stars turned actors, I'd put McCartney square in the middle. As far as musicals go, it's still better than ""Sgt Pepper"",""Glitter"" and ""Evita"", but a far cry from ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Grease"".It has more storyline than ""Magical Mystery Tour"". But it's basically a caper musical at a time when musical films were very few and far between, and didn't interest people all that much anymore.As a film, it's pleasant and light enough, safe for kids to watch, the type of film to watch when there's nothing on TV, what I call a ""Sunday afternoon"" type of movie.It looks and sounds good, but the package is no-frills. McCartney's commentary would've added something to it at least.Or a CD/DVD combo release would've been a help.I think the Beatle fanatics will either like it and laugh or outright hate McCartney for redoing Beatle songs. Worth watching for Bryan Brown and Tracey Ullman."
3,Distracting & annoying camera shots steal the MAGIC!,I would have given this production 5 stars for the terrific performance but for one very annoying flaw. Just when I was caught up in the magic of this most incredible opera the camera would switch from the stage to the audience and I found myself staring into the face of a girl in the audience. This happened not once but several times during the opera. It was so annoying and distracting that it killed my enthusiasm for this rendition of The Magic Flute! If that were not enough to steal the magic they actually showed the actors OUT OF CHARACTER during the intermission! Watching the three muses SMOKE while Pamina and Tamino played chess completely destroyed it for me!
1,This seller is a liar!!!,"This seller is announcing this item online as a DVD, however I order this and I received a CD. I could not return it because I had opened it and just after I noticed.Dont buy if you want a DVD. it is a CD"
1,Doesn't work,Waited for over a month only to have it arrive and it doesnt work. Pluged it in and there is no power to main unit.I would return it for refund....but it will cost me more in postage than it was worth.So will most probably throw it away. :-(
2,Meh,"Piper's exegesis was surprisingly weak in this book. I love John Piper, and he is honestly probably the reason I'm a Christian. But I think he may be wrong on Justification and Imputation. Wright's exegesis of all of the passages here seem to be much more true to the text and much less blinded by a tradition than Piper's same exegesis."
4,Course Text Book,"This is a relatively quick read for one of my classes. The reinforcement of the idea of ""double imputation"" is a something that continues to be talked about and stressed in my class."
4,UN LIBRO DE MAGIA,MAGIA BLANCA..porque en este libro agrega a los cuarzos la MAGIA CON VELAS Y CON YERBAS... los cristales de cuarzo NOS PROTEGEN DE LAS MALAS VOLUNTADES Y AUEMNTAN NUESTRA ENERGIA POSITIVA ... Está buenísimo el libro !
1,Far too clinical in approach....,"Rather than a well written and enlightened book about the world's religions, this book is excrutiatingly difficult read. It is more like a graduate student's thesis with references interrupting the flow of every other sentence. I found this book very disappointing in style, organization, and with too much information about religions that don't exist anymore. The content is there, but it is too difficult to dissect..... Find another guide that will help you understand the similarities/diffences in the world's religions. This one doesn't cut it."
2,Glass Cruet,Product was just the right size - only problem is the opening in the spout is so small that it barely drips the oil or vinegar out - I wanted it to make salad dressing - but there is no way an herb will pass thru this spout - Only good for flavored vinegar - with so spices - would not purchase again - and knowing what I know now would not have purchased it it the first place
4,8oz glass cruet,"Size is smaller than it looks in the photo, but 8oz is 8oz, so that's my problem. The glass was a bit thin, but the shape is very stable and would never tip over. Nice simple shape - free from country flowers or other specific decorations."
1,It broke in 1 day,The glass is too thin. It reminds me of a cheap high school chemistry set and not something to be used in a home kitchen. It was sitting on the counter next to a dish rack. A dish fell over and tapped the spout. Crack.
5,Drippy no more,"Gift for my stepson who writes ""It's definitely a 5. The stopper as far as I can tell does not leak at all. I was afraid that the stopper would fall off when I poured, but I leave one finger lightly pressed on the stopper while I'm pouring and that seems to keep it in place. It might stay in place without my finger there, but I haven't tested that method yet. The only downside would be that it does not hold as much oil as other designs. But this design is so attractive and leak-proof that I don't really care about having to refill more often."""
3,At least it doesn't leak,"This is a neat looking oil dispenser. It doesn't hold much oil but it doesn't leak, which is great. However, it is very fragile. One little knock and it shatters. I have to say, it's too expensive for something that is bound to break within a year. I say skip it. The only plus is you may be able to save the unique glass stopper to use in another, sturdier bottle."
1,Thin glass,"When we received the dispenser, it was already broken. The glass is too thin. Not a good product at all."
2,"Looks good, breaks even better","Looks good and works well. If your the clumsy type though, stay away from this item. A short fall into the sink will most certainly result in a drain full of broken glass. I've bought two and broken two, not going to make it a third. I'll find a nice sturdy plastic one."
4,Much nicer than the big plastic bottle.,"I have two of these, one for sesame oil and the other for olive. These are definitely attractive and easy to fill and clean. The only downfall is that they are a little bit low-flow for my tastes, the vent to allow air in while pouring is a little too small, so the oil comes very slowly. Nice for drizzling, not when I want to quickly coat something."
5,Works perfect,"I keep my olive oil in this cruet. It works perfectly. Non-drop. Super easy to pour. I do pour it with my finger over the spout just in case... not that it's required. I just don't like the feeling of having glass that could ""possibly"" drop out as I pour.... works fantastic though."
4,Could have been 5 stars,"The only reason for the four stars, it's because the glass is not as thick as it looks on-line. Other then that, the Cruet works great, no drips to clean up after."
5,Beautiful!,The top spout was broken when it arrived. When I contacted the manufacturer they quickly sent me a free replacement. I love this bottle! It dispences oil in a small stream that I find perfect for daily uses. The oil savings will pay for this in no time.
5,Beautiful Crystal,The piece is beautiful and is exactly as described. It arrived in perfect condition and in a timely manner. I thought the price was reasonable for the product.
4,"flexible is nice, until the bolt broke","The lens in the mask is excellent. Easy to wipe the front element clean after a shot between the eyes, and difficult to even get the rear element dirty in the first place. They never fogged in a full day of playing in the hot sun. The flexible jaw piece is nice; it allows you to get your eyes in line with iron sights on say, an airsoft gun.After several uses, one of the plastic bolts (the black dot in the bottom-left of the jawline in the product picture) broke, loosening that side of the mask. It still works great, but it really should've been a stronger piece of plastic."
2,Lovely drawings but this story has been told before,"I got sucked in by the publicity around this book, including an article in ""Antiquarian Book Review"". The story was lightweight, insubstantial and certainly not a new idea.The presentation was nicely done as far as the drawings and the page layouts. It took all of 30 minutes to read the story. When I finished I wondered what I was missing, that such a trivial piece of work should get so much publicity. One could get as much ""enlightenment"" into the human condition by watching an episode of Sex in the City.If you really want to read this, save your money and find a copy at the local library, or at reduced price at a book sale."
1,"Love Sophie Dahl, hate this book...","I very rarely give a 1star review. But this book was awful! I love Sophie Dahl and i LOVE her cookery show and will happily watch clips of it on youtube (now it is no longer on air). I really wanted to like this book, but i could not understand it and so, im thinking, it wasnt my sort of thing.It made no sense to me. So maybe you either get it , or you don't. I, was among the 'don'ts'.I know i'm being annoying in my review but i can't even describe what i didnt like about it! I mean, it wasn't even a book or a novel? It was sort of a ...nonsense poem? but not a poem?Sadly, i returned it."
2,Borrow it from the library...,"It amazes me that the granddaughter of a genius like Roald Dahl would be want to print such fluff. This book offers no originality- it has been told time and time again- the only difference is that this one is masked as being a story for grownups.With all of the glowing reviews in major publications like Vogue and Tatler, one would think that this book was the next ""Pride and Predjudice."" After reading this book, I am certain never to read a book review again. I find them on my own.The only reason I even bother recommend taking this out from the library is that the illustrations are really cute- not complex works of art, but pretty to look at."
1,AHHHH,The person who sold this was not to great they said it was an XL then when I got it said it was a Meduim. Sent it back they were kind of pains about sending it back said that it was a mismarked yet when I tried it on it was way tight. They did after a few emails allow me to return it.
2,Worst Penny Jordan,"The very first romance book I ever read was by Penny Jordan and I've loved the genre ever since. I've always enjoyed her stories especially but when I read this I couldn't believe she wrote it. The heroine is a horrible wimp and I have yet to meet a woman like her in the 21st century. She was so annoying that I found this story impossible to enjoy, if I could give this book zero stars than I would.The Sandra Marton story was enjoyable and the only redeeming thing about purchasing this book. Her characters were easy to like and the heroine in the story was strong and independent. I hate when the women are all wimpy and clingy to the men like they couldn't possibly survive without a man."
2,Never received the book,Amazon does not provide you with a chance to ask to divert a book to another address before they ship a book.
5,A Truly Special Experience,"I doubt I have ever read a story so sad as Eckert's story about the extinction of the passenger pigeon. Allan Eckert, perhaps the best nature writer living today, does a splendid job in documenting the demise of this North American bird that once numbered in the billions. The senseless slaughtering by Nineteenth Century Americans is told with such finesse that one cannot be moved to tears. Even young readers will be touched, for it is one of those rare books that can be read by young and old alike, by girls and boys, by both men and women, (indeed, anyone with an environmental conscience) and ask deep meaningful questions about what we as a species are doing to the other species with whom we share this planet.I can only compare Eckert to John McPhee, another nature writer I greatly admire. This book, The Silent Sky, should be read by everyone. It is truly unforgettable. Hopefully this book will acquaint more readers to the amazing talent of Allan Eckert."
5,I was moved.,"The Silent Sky is a tale of the horrible and total slaughter of an entire species. I was captivated by the novel. In fact, I couldn't stop talking about it, and my friends all wondered what could be so interesting about a story about birds. Believe me, it is facinating... just read it."
1,"""Seven Time Nominee""?","Beware of people who claim to be ""nominees"" for the Pulitzer. Anyone can nominate anyone (or even themselves) and it appears that is the case here. If you go to the Pulitzer website you can see who is and who isn't an actual winner or finalist (nominees aren't listed because ANYONE can nominate ANYONE if they pay the fee). [...]The Pulitzer organization specifically says that authors should NOT claim to have any affiliation with the award unless they are a finalist or a winner. Mr. Eckert apparently does not abide by their rules."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!,"Take some good advice, would you rather waste 1500 *gasp* on ... a download, or buy something you can feel, like a Porche, Jag, DS, a few dozen video games, how about a new computer with Alienware? At least that's worth 1500!!!PLEASE, SHOPPERS, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
1,This is a JOKE!,"This was the worst $1500 I ever spent. It was even worst than Luca's ""No Episode III DVD for Christmas""! I would say your money is better spent actually flying to Japan and doling out pimp-slaps to these old farks. I just sold my copy on e-bay. Apparently others new how stink it was, cause I could only get an old 3.5"" floppy and half used bic pen for it... Then PayPal took the bic as their cut of the deal... WTF?! I DON'T EVEN HAVE A FLOPPY DRIVE!"
5,GGGGGGGGGrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaat,I really enjoyed this pdf on chocolate sprinkles. It really opened my eyes on how one can use chocolate sprinkles. I knew the usual ways like on cakes and donuts but in coke is a new way to me. I would advise anyone who loves chocolate sprinkles to buy this pdf or a much better way to use your money is to gamble all your money on black 15 in Las Vegas. Happy spending!!!
3,Amazing uses for chocolate!,"I really liked the recipe for chocolate pineapple clusters. But there was one problem. I got the seven pineapples and got them into the pyramid with the chocolate ""glue"" -- but then my dog bumped the table and the top one rolled off onto the floor. The dog was happy but I wasn't."
2,Painted or coated to appear as copper,"For the money, it is okay, but if you are expecting copper plated, you will be disappointed. The feeder part is a generous sized glass globe which I was surprised it was not some form of polycarbonate. I reside in a hurricane prone area with a few Northeasters here and there and lots of raccoons, so I doubt it will last long in my yard. I think the birds and squirrels will enjoy it until then."
1,Doesn't fit !,This case doesn't fit properly so it keeps popping open which defeats the purpose of having the phone case. Waste of money
1,cheap,What you should expect for the price. There is a belt clip stud on the back that makes the case rather unusable independently without the belt clip. The case does not cover the screen. I would not recommend this item to anyone. It also took 20 days to recieve through Bargain Cell.
4,artificial topiary,"Very nice & real looking foliage on this artificial topiary. The trunk of the tree is a metal pole instead of real wood or simulated wood making the tree look fake. However, I have received a few positive comments from passers-by when they see these topiaries from the street."
2,not what I was hoping for,"The acting in this movie is often very good, but the story is poorly executed (as is the overly loud and usually discordant music).It's true that couples can drift far apart emotionally yet stay together for a long time, but there's no indication here of why this couple ever felt attracted to each other in the first place. There's also not enough suggestion of why the wife does the horrible thing she does to her husband -- one brief scene with a priest that seems to delve into horrors from her own past isn't enough (and it's not even clear that that's what the scene is about).This movie strives for an artistic, art-house feeling, but it fails to convey a genuine sense of the lives of these characters. Seemingly significant events happen that never get picked up on again. The actors deserve better than the several forms of clumsiness surrounding them."
2,Nice book. But no fingering hints.,Nice paper and printing. The songs are all right. Some of them do sound a little repetitive. Be aware that there are no fingering hints. It may work out well for intermediate and advanced players. It took me more than an hour to put the proper fingering in for the first song. Wouldn't recommend it for beginners.
5,Fun music to have,"I bought this for my girls, 12 & 16 years old, and myself. The Pride and Prejudice theme song really sounds like the one from the movie and is fun to play. While slightly easier to play, I think the version or this piece in this book sounds more like the movie than the other Jane Austen music book ( the teal colored one). I would say the pianist needs to be in at least a level 3 or 4 piano book to be able to play these pieces."
4,yet another quality Doris Day twofer,"This great twofer from the Collectables label comprises two of Doris Day's best albums of the late 1950's - 'What Every Girl Should Know', and 'I Have Dreamed'.'What Every Girl Should Know', of course, includes the memorable tune of the title, as well as a good array of songs like ""Mood Indigo"", ""The Everlasting Arms"", ""My Kinda Love"", ""When You're Smilin'"" and ""Not Only Should You Love Him"". There is also a rather-upbeat version of ""What's the Use of Wond'rin'"" from CAROUSEL.'I Have Dreamed' of course includes the lovely KING AND I tune, and also includes ""I Believe in Dreams"", ""All I Do is Dream of You"", ""Periwinkle Blue"" and ""You Stepped Out of a Dream"". There is also a well-judged ""My Ship"" from LADY IN THE DARK, and a plaintive ""Some Day I'll Find You"" from the play PRIVATE LIVES.This reissue is a must-own for Doris Day fans."
3,Love Nest review,"Fast service, enjoyable film with MM and Jack Paar , though dated film about post WWII accomadations in New York."
3,A Complex Book,"It's OK if you are studying in-depth social issues. But, much too complex for the average reader. Not an easy read."
4,"Rear Floor liner, Nissan Titan","Good fit. Not designed as well as ""Weathertech"" product, but it works and is cheaper. Good product for the cost."
2,Septiderm is suspect,Ordered this product to help clear up a skin rash my dog had. Did not get favorable results as the condition spread. Tossed the product and received proper treatment from the vet.
3,"Basic color with water, but paper too thin","My 4 year old daughter loves paint with water books. The pictures are large, and she can color inside the lines as much as she's willing to at the time. But, my biggest problem with this book is that the paper is way too thin, after a few strokes, the paper is soaked!I will probably buy more paint with water books, but probably not from this brand again."
2,Paint with Water isn't as Fun as I Remembered,"Maybe I need to give it another shot, but the painting with water just doesn't seem work that well. Also much more messy than I remembered. My daughter is young, so maybe would be better for an older child."
1,Deep,"This book is a disturbing look into a deeply troubled mind. Unfortunately that is all I can say about William Morain. The fact that a man with a Phd has the nerve to wright what is clearly an attempt at psychological slander is amazing. If you truely want to find out FACTS about Joseph Smith and the Mormon religion, then check out some books that wouldn't be displayed at the local Moromon linching. However, if you just want a good ""Bash The Mormons"" book then you have a winner."
5,Very Satisfied with this Seller,The cuff links were exactly as described. They are unique and made for a classy gift for my airplane flying hubby. I recommend this seller.
4,value for money,"I expect a 3.5 mm audio jack and the pendant is little bigger than expected. It works with my thinkpad T61, and my cell phone. with the laptop the sound quality is not good. but with mobile quality is excellent."
3,Like it with 2 issues,"While working around the house, I use this headset to listen to audio streaming from my laptop. It works fine so long as the Pulsar 260 Bluetooth Pendant (the part with the detachable clip) is in DIRECT line of sight with the IOGEAR Bluetooth 2.1 USB Micro Adapter (the part that connects the Pulsar 260 headset to my laptop). In short, I experience two issues with this headset:1) Soon as I turn around which 'blocks' the DIRECT line of sight between the Pulsar 260 Bluetooth Pendant & the laptop, I start hearing lots of noise/interference.2) I'm unable to use this headset while I making phone call via my laptop's Skype. There may possibly be compatibility issue which is over my head.I'd enjoy this headset more if the above issues are resolved."
4,Surprisingly Good,"The transmitter feels a teensy cheap and the included earbuds are pretty annoying to get on, but the sound quality is way better than I expected. If you're an audiophile like me and you've wanted to try bluetooth buds, these would be a decent place to go for the money."
3,"Some Features do not Work, Audio Quality not Acceptable for Music","The Audio transport controls do not work with my Nokia N73 music edition phone. Disappointing since this is an advance music focused phone. This could be a problem with other NSeries phones. The audio quality while OK for calls, leaves a lot to be desired for music listening. It gets really bad if the phone has more than one active bluetooth connections. The nokia radio player doesn't work with a bluetooth headset either."
2,"No spray, it just runs weakly","Shower head looks beautiful and was received quickly; however, it does not provide a spray. Rather the water just flows weakly from the head in one big stream that falls straight down. We have good water pressure so I don't understand what is causing the problem."
5,Wiley young J.Caesar and the Pirates,"This is a richly imagined novel based on the kidnapping by pirates of young Julius Caesar, an incident that actually occurred but of which no details have survived. The re-creation of ancient Rome and the Mediterranian world is vivid, the characters are psychologically dense with feeling, the tale edge-of -the-seat gripping. I love this book!"
1,Annoying juggling of historical fact,"This is an annoying book in as much as the author moves historical events around to suit his own purpose. One example is Pompey's campaign in Spain which happened at a much later point in time. Many more could be cited.While historical fiction writers certainly have license in interpreting history, the good writers stick to the known timeline. If they stray from this, they usually explain to the reader the reason for having done this in an afterword. Mr. Panella owes his readers an explanation."
2,Very disappointed in this bath!,"Strathwood granite finish tall bird bath . . . yes, it sounds really good, but it's NOT! I am so disappointed with this bath. I gave this bath 2 stars just because I like the look of it, but that's all. I thought it was really pretty. I loved the height. I loved the depth. I was very impressed and happy with my purchase. Now, I just think it sucks and I'm trying to figure out how to make it better but I don't know of anything to make it better except maybe paint . . . which I don't want to have to do. The bowl looks horrible. The finish is peeling up off of it and it is always nasty due I think to the condition of the peeling surface. I would very much like my money back so I could purchase a useable bird bath. The birds won't even bathe in it much less drink from it. I have added rocks worried that it may be too deep. They still don't touch it. Very disappointed I am!!"
1,For the most part---YUCK!!!!!!!,"This is my introduction to Reba. I liked her show and liked the little singing she did on it. I liked the first 10 songs sort of and absolutely hated the rest. It definitely is not country: it's a cousin to Celine Dion. It has those awful drums, sythesizers and strings and that constipated straining for emotion."
1,WHAT'S NEXT? A REBA DISCOGRAPHY COLLECTION?,"That is all that is left! Folks, please, Reba is a fine singer, but you've heard all of these before. Sure, they've thrown in a couple of good new tunes for good measure but they aren't worth the price of the CD. Real Reba fans already own everything she's put out. The only thing left for MCA to do (Mercury, her first label already did it on Oklahoma Girl which is far superior to this) is put out a complete output of every recording she's ever done. Enough is enough."
2,HEARTBREAK HOTEL. NOT WORTHY OF CHECKING IN.,"The Big C&W star turned Big TV star sings all the Big Ones. Funny, but when lumped together in one collection, it becomes so abundantly clear that almost all the tunes are about heartbreak and loss ... she's leaving him, he's leaving her. Yeah, yeah, we know that's the soundtrack for life ... but that doesn't mean you can't divorce yourself from the music. Hey, Loretta!"
2,How many greatest hits cds can you have!,"I love reba, but come on! another ""hits"" cd! reba has already released three greatest hits cds, so why another hits cd? If your tired of hits albums check out ""timeless"" by martina mcbride or ""Those were the days"" by dolly parton! those are the real gems this year!!, and skip on the ""greatest hits"" by reba!"
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY FOLKS??,"One question. Why would ANYONE (new Reba fan or veteran Reba fan) want to buy a product of hers which contains songs already released on her previous CDs and her three greatest hits packages?? Sure, the CD contains two new songs but those two cannot justify the price of a new CD. I just don't understand why people continue to support someone who is filthy rich, is over-exposed on television and cannot bring anything fresh and new to the music industry. Instead of buying this CD, why not use the money you would have spent and donate it to the ""homeless shelters"" or the ""missions"" for poor people who really need it?"
5,Please Stop Whining!,"Everyone needs to stop complaining about the content of this cd. The title is #1's. It should be fairly self explanatory what you are getting. If you are looking for a collection of new songs then maybe this cd isn't for you. If you want MANY of Reba's best songs in one place, this is a great deal.I too have been a Reba fan for many years and can't wait for a new cd. We'll get one soon that will no doubt be worth the wait but until then, enjoy this compilation of great music."
2,WHO TOOK THE UGLY PHOTO COVER???,"I agree with the other reviewers here who say that we DID NOT NEED another Reba Greatest Hits Collection. The first half of the CD is fine. THe other half features Reba at her poppish, foppish worst. But Reba needs to sue her photographers. The woman is fifty years old and she's still trying to make herself look like she's twenty. She fails miserably. The cover photo of her looks like a wax mannequin reject! Reba (never a beauty) will win no beauty contests with the cover photo here and as for the music...well....you've heard it all before and I'm sure if you're a Reba fan you already have all the songs on this collection (save for the new singles...which are forgettable) so forget this collection. Advice to Reba: Get a new photographer!!"
5,"""Don't Rock the Reba!""","This yummy little Oklahoma Lady is a musical icon,and to dispute that is to expose yourself as a complete fool! Her success at having recorded 33 Number One hits is certain proof. Now take notice that I typed the word ""musical"" in front of the word ""icon!"" I agree with almost N O N E of her political views.....but I sincerely adore her music! To be fair, a good reviewer MUST keep the artist's entertainment talents seperated from the artist's personal life. Reba...you GO, Girl!"
5,#1's,I have always loved Reba's music and was able to find this CD. It has practically every song of hers that I love singing along to in my truck! Crank it up!
3,REBA!!!,"If you love reba you will love this. It has all my favs on it. Sombody, I am surviver You'll be ITS ALSOME!!!"
4,Lotta good songs!!!,"You can't go wrong with the #1's Reba collection that's forsure. Great listening, but I still enjoy all my old Reba albumsand I hope she comes out soon with a new album filled with#1 hit possiblities."
2,enough is enough...don't take your real fans for granted!,"Reba:I've adored you since I was 11 years old. I see you everytime you come to New York. I saw you on Broadway, I own 33 of your albums, some in CD AND record or tape form.I am highly disappointed at yet another greatest hits album. Your real fans have been there through and through. Yet the new music we get is on an album which has songs that already appear on how many others?The reality, is that this is Reba's sixth hits package. She had a Best of album in the early eighties, then greatest hits vols. 1, 2 and 3. She also had a hits package of her early music, Oklahoma Girl, and now this. I'm tired of it. Way way WAAAAY too many country musicians do this crap.Enough is enough....albums like this take advantage and do nothing but disrespect your real fans.The only reason I gave this two stars, is because the songs are no doubt great. Just an unfortunate compilation."
3,America's Sweetheart!,Who can rip out a song with all the high notes like Reba? No one compares. She is truly an American success story and America's Country Sweetheart!I feel that all CD's are over-priced though and for that reason I give only three stars! Each individual can judge price for themselves.
2,Promising Start - Lousy Finish,"Somewhere around the middle of this book it reads as though someone else finished it, rather than the person that wrote the first part of it.The result is not a welcome one.What starts out as an interesting story with a lot of insights into the goings on with the PGA Tour, The Masters and the US Open turns into a poorly plotted jumble of a story in which the characters lose their reality, the story loses it's focus and the reader loses interest. That's not a winning trifecta and this book is a huge disappointment."
1,Could've been better.....,"My bad rating isn't for the music , which rocks - it's for the piss poor mastering ! This sounds WORSE than my old CD's - if you buy this get it for the great music but DON'T buy to get a disc that sounds better than your old ones ."
3,suspicious,"Even though the box had a sealed plastic wrapping, the product had been opened because the strip that seals the lid was broken and half of it was missing. I have purchased many jars of this and never has the strip been broken or missing. Also the little scooper was a cheaper version. If this was from a dept. store I would have returned it immediately, but as I needed it for a trip, I kept it. I have reservations about the product inside, as it could have been replaced with a cheaper cream. I will not order from that vendor again. The other times I have ordered this it was perfectly sealed and packaged. I thought this vendor had stars by their name, but I am afraid that I would not give them more than 2. I am concerned now about ordering this online anymore."
3,"Films are Fantastic, Viewer is very flimsy","I got these and a bunch of vintage reels for myself for Christmas and the local stores were sold out of viewers so I ordered online.The reels are amazing in their clarity and totally 3D! but the viewer itself is extremely lightweight and feels fragile. Doubt it couldhold up to a child's use.The holographic post card is really cool, too. Just wish the viewer was better."
1,It sucks,"I recently bought a Travel Ac Wall Charger that fits a Sansa E280 8gb mp3 player, and well it dose not even charge my mp3 player. I now have to convert back to my car charger. I know it is not my mp3 player because my car charger charges the mp3 player just fine. I would not recomend this product to anyone."
2,This is Telarc?,"I have many Telarc recordings and know they have a reputation for high quality recordings. So when I bought this SACD I was expecting the same. Sorry to say, this recording is actually quite bad, especially the first part, and I couldn't believe this came from Telarc. The original 2 channel CD release (from many years ago) from Telarc is far superior to this recording. VERY dissappointing!"
2,Maximum Reviewed,"There have been a few questions about what exactly 'Maximum Dave Matthews' is. This CD is essentially an interview although Dave Matthews' voice has been spliced into the commentary by the interviewer. It browses over issues such as his childhood in South Africa, his fathers death and various inspirational events. Being a devoted Dave Matthews fan I believe that this is not very interesting and I wouldn't consider it worth buying."
3,Chromasex Monkeydrive is WAY better,"Disrepair is allright, I mean its okay................ Its better than Razing Eden........... But i really recommend LUXT's Chromasex Monkeydrive....oh yeah: like every Luxt song, Luxt's lyrics TOTALY RULE in this cd. Buy Disrepair if your a REAL Luxt fan."
4,good.....,"This CD is pretty good. Although I'm not too huge of a David allan Coe fan, My favorite song on here which I really love is ""You never even Called Me by MY name"". That is the main song that influenced me to buy this. I like some the other songs like: Long Haired Redneck, A Sad Country Song, and some others are alright."
5,Great investment,"The commentaries on Psalms (two volumes) are not cheap, but are a great investment. They are well-made books that should last for years, and John Phillips is an excellent writer, thorough, but easy to understand. They would make thoughtful gifts, also."
2,DermaNew refill sponge applicator,The seller should make it clear what tool it fits. I bought a set of 6 and It does not fit the tool. So it is useless!
2,I'm sure it's fine,"This sponge does not fit on the tool for the Dermanew facial rejuvination system. I'm sure it's great for whatever tool it belongs with, I just had no use for it."
1,Awful.,"This is the worst record I own. All the songs seem rushed, the quality of the recording suck$. I never imagined a classic like blue moon could sound so bad. The only good song is ""Wrap your Troubles in Dreams,"" an interesting take on the song made famous by Sinatra."
4,Still a pleasure to read,"This was one of the early texts dedicated to spatial orientation and will still be of interest to those working in the field and wishing to understand the antecedents of current work. Howard is one of the finest writers in the field and very knowledgeable. This text should be part of the library of anyone who works on topics related to spatial orientation in reference to gravity, e.g., vestibular perception."
1,Racist anti American anti White drivel,"Don't waste your time reading this anti American, anti white drivel and a racists version of American history. We have all seen this guys videos now of him bashing America, bashing whites, and forcing his audience on our taxpayer dime to repeat anti American false statements like the Pilgrims were illegal aliens(did not know the US existed with borders when the Pilgrims arrived."
4,America the greatest,Love this CD..after hearing many of America's hits on the radio I knew I had to have this recording..play it often & never get tired of it!!
4,ALMOSTperfect greatest hits,"HOW MANY TIMES YOU CAN SEE A GROUP WITH SO FEW RECORDS TO HAVE SO MANY HITS? AMERICA IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE I JUST WISHED THEY INCLUDED ALL AROUND (STUDIO VERSION)BUT THIS COPILATION IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY 70'S FAN IN PARTICULAR AND GOOD MUSIC LISTENER IN GENERAL,PEOPLE THIS IS AMERICANA 100%"
3,only in america,I purchased this recording remembering a few enjoyable cuts. They were still enjoyable but the rest are just average just like the band
2,Stick To The Hits,Loved the hits we all know...But most of the non hits are real stinkers. No wonder they didn't last too long...
4,incomplete greatest hits,"america should included 3 more songs to make it really a complete greatest hits album. these songs are ALL MY LIFE, ALL AROUND & INSPECTOR MILLS."
4,America - The Complete Greatest Hits,"America was one of the elite soft-rock groups; only Bread outshines them in my book. Practically every hit is here on a single disc compilation. Best songs on here include ""A Horse With No Name"", ""Sandman"", ""I Need You"", ""Ventura Highway"", ""Tin Man"" & ""Sister Golden Hair"". There's also a cover of ""California Dreamin'"" & two brand new tracks that round out the set for a total of 22 songs. This makes it a better collection than History released many years ago.Rhino has done its usual high quality remastering. The liner notes are very good. I've only been a casual fan of America, soft-rock never being my first choice of listening. There's a little filler here which makes the title somewhat misleading but that's a minor point. Enjoy this on a late night with that special someone with the candles burning."
3,"Close, but no Banana","As many reviewers suggest, there has long been a need for a more definitive America Anthology or Greatest Hits. The earlier Greatest Hits album was woefully incomplete. This disc fills the void more fully, but leaves out so many great songs and includes so much filler that it also falls short of being a satisfactory collection. Where's Three Roses and Riverside from the first album? What about California Revisited from Homecoming? And so on. Rhino, a subsidiary of Warner (for those who don't know), has pieced together a collection that's not bad, especially as an overview. If they had to keep it to one disc, they should have cut down the number of 80s tunes and included better material from the band's early days."
3,Classic,"The main reason i bought this CD was that i heard the song ""you can do magic"" on the radio. It's a happy sound and i turned it on loud in my car....very loud and sang along.So i ordered this CD and when i put it on at home, the 70's really come along with all of it's memories. People of my age (46) all know. The sound of this band is sometimes similar to that of the ""little river band"" (also 70's). Even the way of vocals can be compared. Ok it's a little bit dated but still nice to hear now and then and to sing the songs yourself... that's funI give a 3 star rating because the CD is allright, but not more or less. But in case you don't, it is something you should have."
4,"God bless ""America"".","Like so many other groups recently, ""America"" has updated their original ""History: Greatest Hits"" with this ""Complete Greatest Hits"". Fine by me. This includes every track from the previous collection, plus 10 more. The big addition here for many is the inclusion of ""You Can Do Magic"", one of their last big hits. But obviously the older songs are the big draw. Included is ""I Need You"", ""Ventura Highway"", ""Lonely People"", and ""Sister Golden Hair"", among others. I think many people's favorite, and mine as well, is ""A Horse With No Name"". That's just such a classic. This disc is a good example of quality and quantity, and should be owned by any fan of ""America""."
3,America's InComplete Greatest Hits Digital Download,"The digital download album is misnamed. It is a wonderful digital album but it DOES NOT include every track that is on the CD release. I specifically purchased it because of ""California Dreaming"" and then found that track is not included. Now I must purchase the CD just to get the one track that was missing."
4,"Nice compilation of the real ""great"" AMERICA Hits","America and the 1970s, is an association you cannot avoid...This excellent compilation made by the wizards of RHINO Records, includes almost all of their greatest hits. The sound quality is really good.An ideal choice if you love to go listening good music while driving your car, guessing that anytime you should be driving all along the Ventura Highway, following the track of a Horse with No Name... Trying to reach your Sister Golden Hair, named Daisy Jane!... This CD will do Magic in your ears!"
5,El mejor diccionario de latin,"este es el mejor diccionario de latin que hay es un libro viejo y lleno de polvo, no se encuentran nuevos, pero es un libro basico para los que estudiamos latin, pagar mas de $150 USD es caro pero si pueden obtenerlo haganlo."
3,Exquisite Pop Ballads,"As a crazed Hollies fan, I'll be the first to admit that few of the group's albums (including Write On) are ""masterpieces."" So why collect the Hollies' library? They're superb at creating exquisite pop ballads with soaring vocal harmonies. ""Love Is The Thing,"" ""I Won't Move Over"" and ""My Island"" are precious examples of melodic love songs. Few bands can equal the breathtaking heartbreak of ""There's Always Goodbye."" Write On bounces along gingerly with touches of funk (Star), county-pop (Sweet Country Calling) and an enticing Latin dance number (Narida). Unfortunately, the latter half of the album disappoints with the aimless ""Stranger"" and the breakneck tempo of ""Crocodile Woman (She Bites).""Budget conscious collectors should search for the Hollies EMI ""Boxes."" Released in 1995, each contains four Hollies' CDs replicating the original vinyl LP format, and selling for about forty dollars."
4,When it comes to Foreign Affairs it's... Carry On Emmanuelle,"""Carry On Emmanuelle"" (GB 1978) is not the best of the Carry On series (in fact it was the last) but there are many funny moments. Carry On king Kenneth Williams plays a French ambassador living in London, and when his wife Emmanuelle (Suzanne Danielle) comes to stay, it's not just the ambassador falling at her gorgeous feet! Everyone is in a sticky situation after Emmanuelle's visit, and after she's seduced nearly every important man in England! Although the acting has a lot to be desired, ""Carry On Emmanuelle"" will look good in any collection of timeless British comedy. (P.S. The title was originally spelt with a double 'n' in the middle: ""Carry On Emmannuelle"")"
4,"It was good,but, should not be shown to youngar children.","This was a truly amazing video even though it was destined to be one of the last Carry On's ever made. The quality of the picture, sound and effects were good even though it was made in the 70's and the filming of it didn't have the option of high tech viewing. The actors and actresses were brilliant in this particular video even though I didn't enjoy it as much as the other Carry On's because it didn't have all of the original team in it."
4,a tasty treat,"I can honestly say that i had no real hope for this film. Most of the horror films to come out in recent history have been... disappointing. So, i started this movie with no expectations other than turning it off after the first ten to fifteen minuets.what i found was something fairly original, calling itself on most of the cliches that it couldn't avoid and doing everything in it's power to overcome its' obvious budgetary restraints.for fans of zombie films, this should be a real breath of fresh air, done in the style of a Romero film."
3,Bizarre concept for a zombie movie,"Bizarre premise, even for a zombie movie. A comet falls to earth and parasitic organisms use human bodies to procreate, thus turning them into zombies. The thing is that they use male genitalia to put the eggs in them. It is up to a group of survivors to figure out what is going on. The movie, although not that bad, is merely a collage of different films:Day of the Dead (Divimax Special Edition),Species (Collector's Edition), I think the even stole fromStardust (Widescreen Edition)! (champagne scene at the beginning). The acting is ok for a B movie and even the cinematography makes the movie more interesting. The movie was ok, nothing original, but at least it was somewhat entertaining. It really did have a bizarre concept for the zombies though.The DVD is lacking in the Special Features."
3,Hugs Not Drugs,"As far as B-Zombie movies go, this one wasn't too terrible. Days of Darkness was much more of a Sci-fi flick then a traditional horror. The creators definitely added something new and unique (and I stress unique) to the typical zombie story. A few scenes you definitely wont see coming but others you'll see from a mile away. Acting was so-so throughout but could've been worse. If you love zombie movies and think you want to see Days of Darkness then its worth a shot but do not use this movie to introduce somebody to the zombie genre (that's Romero's job). Overall, the quality and budget seemed about on par with an Outer Limits episode, not too good but not too bad. Would I pay to see it again though? Nope."
2,days of darkness,"Not very original, or well put together. It wasnt the worst I've seen, but it wasnt 4 or 5 stars like the reviews on here lead me to believe. I think its an ok B-movie, but it could have been put together way better. If you like B-movies, then its worth the watch, if you dont, dont bother."
3,No Pockets!,"Description advertises pockets, which is why I bought the tiem. It arrived without pockets. Shorts are fine, but they shipped the wrong item."
1,Bad bad bad!!!,"These are one of the worst earphones I've ever experienced. The earphone is too thick, it doesn't fit my ear properly, keeps slipping and it hurts my ears. I bought them as a replacement for my overused and defunct Apple iPOD earphones and boy! there's a heaven and earth difference in the sound quality between the two..so no no no..I don't recommend this at all...only redeeming feature is that you get two pairs...so that you can prolong your misery in waiting for it to break up so that you can buy new ones...I hate it!"
4,Night Train Murders good movie,Night Train Murders is a really good old movie. It take place in Europe in the mid 1970's. Interesting thriller. I would recommend this movie to people of 30 years and older.
4,Classic Horror,"Malifique is a film worth any true cinephile's attention, especially if one enjoys horror. From the opening scene, through the end, it captivates the viewer with a story that taunts the prisoners on the screen.While there are some disturbingly graphic moments, it is much more cerebral than the average horror film. Even if you deduce some of the plot twists, it's still very entertaining."
1,Fake package,"It's hard for me to review this item, because I`ve found the movie really good and well made which would have resulted in a 5 star review. Problem was that I didn`t recieve the DVD like it was labeled (NON-USA FORMAT)but got send the french standard DVD (I think the deal went over at a market place address). First the DVD box was damaged and then I've found out that the movie wasn`t the Australian import which was labeled as a kind of director`s cut with a running time of 133 min.. Like mentioned above it was the standard french DVD with a running time of 85 min., without any special features. So don`t buy this item, because it`s unlikely to recieve what you have bargained for. I`ve sent mine back."
2,"Love the Actors, MOvie sucked","I think this movie had soooo much potential with christopher walkins character, but the rest was just unfunny, sorry chris."
4,quirky and quaint,"I found this movie to be one of those little surprising gems that has the right balance of black comedy, rich characters and a wonderfully eccentric and talented cast."
5,also called Plots With a View,"great movie... saw it over in England. great cast, good plot.... some good twists in there as well... true love and a mortuary...a great movie for any collection. Walken is great... just don't let him plan ur funeral..."
4,"An Unusual ""Western""","The novel is set around a Harvard graduate's search for self-understanding and initiation into manhood through participation in a buffalo hunt during the 1880's. While the setting and subject matter are clearly ""Western"" in nature, the novel shares few other similarities with traditional stories of the West. There are no encounters with Indians or shoot-outs with rival Cowboys. Instead, Williams' story brings to life the brutal nature of the hunt, the drab and barren existence of life in a Colorado boom-town and the mix of beauty and terrible ferocity of nature with an almost naturalistic approach similar to that of Zola."
4,Not Just a Crossing,Pity the poor American bison and all those who sought wealth through its death. Admire the courage of all such as Will Andrews who had a dream and the intelligence and funds to pursue it. Can you find yourself in the life of at least one of the characters who met at Butcher's Crossing?
2,Depressing,"I loved ""Stoner"" and after reading many of the reviews of this novel decided I needed to further explore the writing of John Williams. The writing is excellent; the description of the land, the buffalo, the stench of the killings, the snow, pine trees and the physical description of the men. However, that's it. I never felt any connection to the characters themselves. I just got bogged down in all the detail, the endless description of the miseries these men endured only to have everything lost. Someone suggested this novel could be Camus writing a ""western"" - that pretty much sums it up. However, Camus left me pretty cold; this does the same. I'm not sure what food for thought this provides beyond life is hard, meaningless, and so what?"
4,Great Learning Tool and Fun Too!!,This was a gift for my daughter who had taken 4 years of High School French. She is an avid Harry Potter reader and this has been a fun challenge for her.
3,I miss all of the sundry details.,"While this translation stays true to the main story and its characters, I notice a few things that are omitted completely. Unfortunately, these are all of the bits of sundry details that helped to paint the Wizarding world more vividly in the English version."
4,Very good electric chain saw,"The chain saw is powerful, easy to use and well made, except for the oil level indicator. Oil level is very hard to see. The 800 number provided for support is not for McCulloch, but for third party and they are not knowledgeable about the product. All I was trying to do is get some basic information and they didn't know what I was talking about. The instruction booklet has some mistakes in the descriptions."
1,YEAH THAT COVERS IT TOTALLY,I find this product to be a complete waste of MY MONEY AND YOURSthe saw has NO POWERits chain oil ablity is wrose than terriblebrings the word SUCK to mind
1,Chain saw,Don't waste your time or money! It is a piece of crap. It locked up after just a few hours of use.
1,not a long term investment,"died after two hours,,this co is not around anymore// amazon refuned my money no problem..but you never know you might get a good one,, amazon told me to get rid of it ,,i took took the chain and bar and used it on an old 14 i had,, fit perfect.. so if you want to take a gamble go ahead,,but remember its a throughaway..."
4,A Really nice boom box;BUT....,"I recently purchased the#cfd-e75 at a local Target store. I am very pleased with it and the many features [Wake,Timer etc.] But the description is a bit in error. It takes 6 ""C"" batteries, not ""D"" and it requires three[3] AA batteries for the feature backup. All in all a really cool box."
2,Broke and repair is twice as much as I paid...,"Worked for about 4 years and then the CD player stopped playing CD's during the tracks randomly. I have another boombox from Sony that is over 7 yrs old and never an issue - I agree, Sony products have started to be less and less reliable over the long haul....and the repair rates are outrageous - part of their strategy for planned obsolescense....and I just bought another boombox that was NOT Sony...."
2,too hard core for this waver,"I have Newer Wave II the second in this series and love it, so I requested this CD for my birthday. It is extremely industrial in sound. It is a bit much for enthusiasts of the brighter side of the original new wave hits."
5,A Must for the Sabbath,"I LOVE IT!!! What better way to enjoy the Sabbath than to sing of the Lord's Praises with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir? This album is just the ticket! It's very powerful, and uplifting.What? You mean I can only give this album five stars? But that doesn't even BEGIN to do it justice!I love it. Truly a masterpiece!"
5,One of my favorite MoTab CDs,"Beautiful CD. Especially enjoyed the wonderful Come Thou Fount, and the simplicity of the shaker hymns Simple Gift and Take Time to Be Holy. Battle Hymn of the Republic and The Spirit of God are touching and powerful, as well. After owning it for years, I bought it as a thank you gift for a friend."
5,Mormon Tabernacle Choir: The Sound of Glory-Battle Hymn of the Republic,It was great. Tabernacle Choir was so powerful team. I've known Dr. Craig Jessop. He was a guest and directed in my choir. There are few songs in CD that we shared with him. It was awesome between two different choirs (my choir and there).
2,Could Be Better,"The author shares some experiences to make a person laugh. The book has a nice cover. The reader might have some difficulty extracting the humor from the book. However, other readers may not and find the book okay to read."
5,Johnny Cash is a legend!,"This single disc covers a lot of ground - Cash's days at Sun, Columbia and American Recordings. From Cry, Cry, Cry to Hurt, this album gives a roadmap to his long and successful career. You can't do much better than this for one CD of Cash songs. I can highly recommend it!"
3,That man in black,"He still sends shivers of delight to my music brain. This clasic, this legend, his low tone voice brings with fire and harmony. Cash is worth every penny."
1,The Legend of Johnny Cash,I was disappointed in the music. I had never heard some the songs on the album and most of these weren't very good. I only recognized 5 of the songs.
3,The Legend of Johnny Cash,"Johnny Cash is a legend; however, I enjoy the singing voice of Joaqin Phoenix in ""Walk the Line"" more. Call me crazy."
5,A must buy for the Cash lovers,This music cd was way better than what we anticipated ! Great mix of Cash songs. If you are a Johnny Cash lover...this cd is a must have.
5,Cash is the man!,"Cant go wrong with CD no matter what you listen to. It is full of his signature attitude and style. Not much more to say that hasnt been said about the lengend, Johnny Cash."
5,Johnny Cash....,What isn't to love about Johnny Cash. The last song is the best version of this song and so unexpected.
5,Awesome!!,This CD is classic Johnny and for anyone who loves Johnny Cash and Country Music it is a MUST have!!
3,Johnny Cash,My husband is a big fan of JohnnyI would like to get more of his records and will do so in the near future
1,"Sent me wrong tires, twice!",Did not have the tires advertised and sent me the wrong ones twice before I forced them to figure it out.
2,MPx220 Great but charger outlet problems,"This is a great phone in general when you consider all the functionality built into the product. I love the memory card as I use it as a MP3 player. Never had any problems out of the ordinary regarding reception. In addition, you can store a billion contacts add tasks, review your calendar.However, I have had to reset the phone once (never could figure out the issue) and I have replaced it once and will try again to replace the phone. The problem: the connection for the battery charger or USB data cable is sensitive and loses its connectivity.As indicated, this is the second time this has occured. Since I am past the warranty period (one year), I am unsure how Motorola will treat me. If I have a choice then I will move to a new phone as I am unwilling to risk Motorola not resolving the issue. I personally expect phones to last a long time and this is unacceptable (two phones over 15 months)."
3,Good phone overall.,"6 Months ago I would have rated this phone 5, but it has picked up a common problem that tends to affect them after 1-2 years of use. An internal component goes bad within the phone and the only way it will charge is via its USB sync cable. Needless to say this is quite annoying. Other than that it's been a wonderful phone with great features, but the charging problems that develop later kinda suck. I still love the phone...just wish I could charge it somewhere other than my laptop (it won't even charge in a ac to USB or dc to USB charger....it has to be connected to a computer)>"
1,No phone,"I have not received my item, even AFTER the last day of shipment, and i have not been refunded, DO NOT BUY IT."
5,Great book,"I recently picked up this book at a college bookstore, and I read it in about two hours. This is a fabulous book to get all the basic information needed to start making movies. It's littered with helpful diagrams and good examples. Buy it now!"
3,"Accurate in descriptions, little insight in conclusions","After figuring out the names of the real neighborhoods from the census data (which I thought was unnecessary to hide there names, so here they are: Beltway = Clearing, Dover = Brighton Park, Archer Park = Little Village, and Groveland = Avalon Park), I thought the descriptions the tensions in the neighborhood were fairly accurate and unbiased. The authors' analysis and conclusions, however, lacked insight. They also unnecessarily ranted on the Bush Administration. Their prescription for integrating neighborhoods was basically form multiracial coalitions and throw a ton of Federal money at the problem. Overall, I'm excited that these parts of Chicago are being investigated but unimpressed by the level of scholarship."
3,Fascinating in places...,"I'm about 3/4's through the book, but I feel like I've read enough to offer an objective review. I like the book and found it an interesting look at society and racial views and attitudes in neighborhoods. I just wish the researcher had been able to name the real neighborhoods, but I understand why the names were changed.Overall, if you're looking for well-written, detailed research on how views on class and race are changing neighborhoods this is a book for you."
3,There Goes the Neightborhood,The book contained informative information which I could relate to within my community and surrounding areas.
4,"Pretty to look at, lightweight, and functional","It is very pretty and my daughter loves holding the little birdie. It is also nice because it looks heavy, but is actually light. It is made of metal with some kind of faux stone finish that looks good in the garden. BUT if you have hard water like I do, don't use it for a bird bath. It's positively amazing how fast the calcium builds up in a black bird bath. It's much nicer for birdseed. The little birds love hopping up to it and feeding from the edges."
5,Beautiful anywhere,"This bird feeder is so beautifully sculpted and so wonderfully finished it will serve as a centerpiece on your dining or buffet table if you fill it with food or seasonal ornaments (it will handle everything from gourds for Halloween/Thanksgiving on up), with the little 'bird' creating a whimsical note to a formal design. People assume it is a display bowl if you put fruit or rolls in it.I almost hated to take mine outside, but after all, I did buy it as a bird feeder -- it will hold a bird as heavy as a pigeon sitting on the edge, and if I found fault with it at all it would be that, as they hog the food from smaller birds; it is ridged inside to help such birds in and out, by the way. You can put it on the top of a post, set it on a wall, put it anywhere in your garden or lawn and it will instantly fit in. If it weathers I certainly can't tell -- more than worth the money!patch[...]"
4,Not for the birds,"This is a very attractive little item - but it does not meet my standards for bird feeder (no drainage, no protection from snow or rain) or bird bath (not really large enough) However, it makes a wonderful decorative dish on the kitchen counter to catch keys, etc. Really, that is what I purchased it for, and it looks very nice on the grey granite. LOL"
2,Nothing special,"There's nothing special about this stuff, other than it is fairly easy to use. It's a fine abrasive cleaner mixed with soap. It doesn't clean like a clay bar. The abrasive can be hard to rinse completely off. Not worth the time, IMO. Instead, go with a real cleaner/polish like Meguiars #7 or a real clay bar."
3,"It works, but you need to keep using it","It works alright, It doesn't get all of the dirt and grit and when it says ""does not leave residue"" make sure you rinse really well. I rinsed the car about 3 times and finally just got fed up and took a damp towel. Doesn't remove swirl marks the first time so maybe you have to keep using it. It does a good job otherwise."
3,"Easy to work with, but be sure to rinse it off","1. The bottle's shape is detrimental to one wet hand gripping and shaking.2. Easy to apply, cleaning power the same as car wash, but need some elbow grease to polish out the light scratch/swirling.3. Rinse it well, preferbly with a microfiber cloth wiping, or you will have white, hard water type residue left on the car.This is a light polishing compound type cleaner. It polish the paint a bit, remove the paint overspray and tree saps by polishing, unlike true Clay bar that remove the stuff by lifting. Results are not as good as claying, but it's easier to work with, just like a hand car wash."
2,NOT the same as a clay bar,"Although this does take some contaminants off the paint, it is not strong enough to take caked-on brake dust off, or even sap. You have to work the product a lot harder and basically scrub the contaminants off the paint. The same can be done with a sponge and water.If you are looking to remove stubborn contaminants, purchase a real clay bar kit, it will be faster, and the results will be much better!"
2,"DON""T WASTE YOUR TIME","Left a residue, even though the bottle says it doesn't. Didn't clean very well either. I am going to try the regular clay bar and see if that works any better."
1,garbage,"Buy a real clay bar, they work better and are actually easier to use.This stuff does not take the grit out of your paint.Vigorously scrubbing, recommended on the label for tough areas, didn'thelp for the light areas.I had to use a clay bar to get the silky smooth results I wanted,after I used this junk.Waste of time and money."
1,waste of money,thought this product was a waste of $15 and i am embarassed i put it on my new mercedes. left it with all still spotty marks and gross.
3,Some interesting quirks,"A widow short on cash decides to set her niece up with a wealthy man. The widow almost immediately (of course) finds a perfect young, wealthy, handsome man who also needs to marry, but she ends up propositioning him herself. What follows is a marriage of convenience that turns into something more. The book's fairly novel for a romance (in my reading experience at least) in that it focuses on making a relationship work after marriage and a previously experienced heroine comes right out and says she enjoys sex and had a good sexual relationship with her deceased husband. (Amazing!) However, why do deceased husbands who actually have sex with the heroines always have to be drunken philanderers? (Argggh! It is okay for a woman to have more than one satisfying relationship! It is!) I did love the hero's comic relief best friend though. He was the best thing in the book."
3,Never read it- but have read TMM,"I have all 7 books of the English version of Tokyo Mew Mew, and I was excited when I heard there was a sequel, but now not so much. So far, there are only 2 Tokyo Mew Mew A La Mode books out now, and I WANT THEM IN ENGLISH!!! Sorry, but the series is so darn good, I even got punk-rocker girls at my school reading them! I can't wait until this series is translated.P.S: This review was to express my thoughts and feelings about Tokyo Mew Mew A La Mode."
1,Not the same formula,"This shampoo lists only 4 ingredients. I loved that version of the shampoo and used it for years. The shipment I received from Amazon was the same bottle but not the same product. Here is the ingredient list: water, cocoamide DEA, sodium laurel sulfate, potassium dodecyl benzene sulfonate, sodiam cocoyl sarcosinate, hydrolyzed wheat protein olivate (olive oil glutinate). This product is unusable and smells like strong industrial pine tar soaps. I hope you get the old formula and not the new chemical one like I did."
5,This shampoo is great!,"Before I bought this olive oil shampoo I was using Wal-Mart's ""Equate"" brand of ""Pantene,"" which had dried out my hair something awful; it actually began falling out in clumps! Fortunately my wife suggested we give this a try and I am so glad we did! This product restored my hair in just a few washings. I've been using it for a couple of months now and my hair has never looked healthier or been more manageable, and I don't even use conditioner any more. It's also wonderful for washing the face. (I can't imagine why anyone would write a negative review about this fine product if they've actually tried it.)"
2,Could have been better,"I have tried all sorts of shampoo for my dry, flaky scalp and unfortunately this product did not do too much for me. It was ok/fair initially but did not make my scalp feel moisturise, in fact within hours my scalp felt itchy again."
2,Problem Plagued MM Pro,"Inital unit purchased 6/04, now on third warranty replacement unit. First two had solar/battery issues culminating in battery failing to hold a charge after two weeks of operation. The most recent replacement will not operate unless the propane tank is completely full and thus shuts down after 12-15 hours operation. The company has been decent about warranty replacements but my patience with this expensive, tempermental device is wearing thin. I cannot recommend this problem plagued Pro model."
1,Abandoned child of a dysfunctional family,"I wish I could write a glowing review for any of the Mosquito Magnets, but unless you are dedicated to spending a lot of time working on these machines, you might as well hire the neighbor kid to hang around and swat mosquitoes for you. The original company, American Biophysics has disappeared off the map, taking the warranty service with them. The new company, Woodstream Corp just looks at you like a cow at a passing train when you call customer service. Maybe someday, some reputable company will take this idea and turn it into a viable product for consumers. Great concept, incredibly poor execution."
1,Waste Of Money,I purchased the unit and it worked great the first year. The unit is now a expensive paper weight. It will not run. I have called customer service nine times but with no satisfaction. This unit clearly has a design flaw with the propane system. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.
2,Six Hundred Update or Junk Fourteen Hundred Cussing Customer,"I sense a strong consensus amongts us ""long timers"" surmised ...Cus'American Bio has ""#!&%"" all of us'Shoot! I'd go without ,but #**#when its ""on""what mortal can't help but ""shell out""American Bio-yearly-physics Co. is, unfortunately, indicative of corporate manufacturing's failure to ""be responsible"".ethics are not ""in vogue""'a good bottom line is owners good time!'A Sing along (tune of ""This Old Man"")We won't shareWe don't careWe'll play #*#!* youCause we don't share or carea good bottom line is owners good timea good bottom line is owners good time(wiley Nelson c. 1905)"
1,There will be problems & you'll be on your own.,"This worked great for us for 2 years, but now it has a problem. Everyone I know with one of these has problems with their ignition needing to be replaced, and parts haven't been sent quickly. Meanwhile-- the mosquitos continue to breed. Customer service always seems to have a 10+ minute wait time- very frustrating. Of course it is hard to troubleshoot over the phone, but when I have looked at others' comments, everyone has had similiar product failures. If this happens while under warranty-- I suggest that you return the unit and get out while you can."
1,A defective product,"Yes, this product is GREAT when it works. We used it successfully for two years, here in mosquito-plagued Vermont. But like some of the other reviewers, our fan did not work this year, and we have received no help from American Biophysics, except that we could spend $600 for a newer version of this product ...!With many competitive products out there, at less than half that price, there is no way we will buy from American Biophysics again. (Any we also have tried to be in touch with the people who run this company, through personal contacts. Well, they didn't even acknowledge our emails and letters)"
1,"Mosquitos yes, mosquito magnet no","The first year our Mosquito Magnet worked without problems and reduced our mosquito population. The second year we have not had it run more than three days without it shutting down and the ""fault"" signal blinking. We have spent plenty of money on the cartidges to clear the system without success. I think we have been taken for a ride...bandits!"
5,"Fun, educational","These beautifully produced cartoons captured my daughter's imagination and inspired an intense interest in the Revolutionary War period. They hit all the highlights, but also delve into some less-famous events and explore some complexities and ambiguities that are usually ignored. The visual medium helped make some of the patriots' amazing accomplishments and the hardships they endured more comprehensible even for me, a longtime student of history.Clearly, this series was a labor of love. Its creators must be very proud."
4,Nice series,"My kids (7,6) love these stories. Nice introduction for them to this part of American history. It has led to some lively discussions! I recommend it."
5,Good for children,I ordered this for my 10 year old grandson at his request. He had seen it at school. He loves it and after receiving it he and his friend watched it the next day. It's a great learning tool for children and they don't think of it as learning.
1,"Disappointing, DON'T BUY!","After searching for an age appropriate video with which to instruct my grandsons, I came across this series. I downloaded the first video, the Boston Tea Party. As I am well versed in American History, I immediately detected a political slant to the video.In the opening minutes, the ""Patriots"" are depicted as a beer swilling, screaming rabble ready for a fight. The heroine is in immediate peril due to the ""patriot"" rabble threatening to burn the ship she is on. I didn't need to see more...DON'T buy this if you want an unbiased representation of the facts."
5,Excellence in Education,"This series is such a refreshing dose of kid-friendly history, delivered in a vehicle kids love to learn while watching. Even slightly older kids will be able to get the big picture and relate to the kids as they explore the events of America's founding. An all-star cast of voices compliment this excellent, non-PC series celebrating the unique qualities of our nation's formative moments."
3,LNN and game breaks cut out,"This is a fantastic series, but I am disappointed that in this set, the LNN and ""Now and Then"" and ""Continental Cartoons"" and other game breaks are not included within the episodes. Instead, they are grouped together in the Bonus Features. My son enjoyed the LNN news and game breaks interspersed throughout the episodes. (Also, the LNN features gave interesting background info on each episode, such as what the weather was like, which can influence a battle's outcome. If you watch them apart from the episodes with with they originally aired, the context is lost.) Now he just wants to just watch the games and LNN features, not the episodes!If I'd known that the episodes were different in this set than in previous DVDs (such as the ones we've borrowed from the library for free!), I would not have bought it."
5,a must see!!!,This DVD set is a must see for all of Americans. All ages will learn and enjoy our history. I love it and so do all of my kids from 4 to 24years old.
4,Follow imaginary kids through the events of the pre-Revolution and Revolutionary War,"These videos are entertaining and well-researched. This set incudes 15 hours, 40 episodes, and some extras, like the ""Mystery Guest Game"" and Ben Franklin's Words of Wisdom.The videos make the personalities involved seem more present-day, and the video children (James the journalist, Sarah the Brit helping Americans, and Henri the little French boy) have modern attitudes and expressions.There is not too much gritty reality in the battle scenes. We like them, but I don't use these as a substitute for actual biographies. I do let my kids watch them (even down to the kindergartener) -- I'm pretty strict about TV, but these make the cut."
5,Liberty Kids,Great series! It is very accurate historically yet with a personal bit of fiction that livens up this cartoon for children! I would highly recommend this series for anyone who wants their children to understand how this wonderful country came to be. It helps you know and understand all our great founding fathers.
3,My kids loved them!,"For the most part, the story writers got things right. Needless to say, they ""forget"" to mention that our founding fathers were God-fearing, and much of the dialog included deference to Deity."
5,Super video,"My son's school (private) utilizes this video series as a part of their US History lessons, and my son loves it. He is a 5th grader and now knows stories about the founding of the US-historical figures and places. It is very entertaining!"
3,Classy Sounds,"I first bought this album when I was 13. I was so taken by Michael's smooth, youthful voice. The pitch was perfect. I listened to ""Push Me Away"" I'm sure about a million times. If you dare to, close your eyes and listen one time and you too will be sold."
3,This CD is NOT Digitally Remastered,"It's mentioned in the Editorial Review that this item is a 2008 Digitally Remastered version. Having received this CD in the mail today, I neither see in the packaging or liner notes, nor hear in my studio headphones, any evidence that this music has indeed been Digitally Remastered. Digital Remastering is the main reason why I made this purchase, and therefore am disappointed with this CD (which is otherwise a classic)."
5,Destiny,This album is without a doubt one of the best albums of the 1970'sBlame It On The Boogie and Shake Your Body(Down To The Ground) are two of the best Disco and Pop songs of the 1970'sPush Me Away and Things I Do For You are two of the R&B; and Soul songs of the 1970's
3,A truly bizarre album,"I picked this album up in vinyl, at random, years ago in a used record store. At first, I didn't understand or like it, but I kept it and over time it grew on me, although I still don't understand it. The style ranges all over the map, from ""soundtrack"" rock to modern choral to techno-pop. It's essentially uncategorizable, which perhaps is why I like it. Some of the high-register male vocals are a bit annoying, but the mixed-sex vocal arrangements, particularly on Track 3 (Rinde), are quite nice. It might be fun to get some friends together and write a story to go with the music."
4,Persistently profound punching,4 1/2Who could express such classically-arranged free-form frenzy's anywhere near as consistently or articulately? Almost everything on Attahk (especially on the supremely satisfying side one) grooves with such eccentrically informed conviction that it easily (and surprisingly) falls on top of thrilling discography.
3,At least its readable,"This version of Lewis & Clark's journals is edited and abridged. This makes it extremely readable, but not 100% history. There is a lot of narrative and summarization by the editor, and not all the journal entries are included. A decent reference, but probably not the best."
5,A Thrilling Read!,"After trying (trying is the operative word here) to slog through the journals in the original spelling and with little or no punctuation, it was a real joy to read this version edited by Anthony Brandt. The stories of their encounters with natives tribes, grizzley bears and of their day-to-day lives make for a compelling adventure story. And unlike the previous editions, Brandt summarizes those sections that are not included in well-crafted prose that keep the story flowing. This reads like the true adventure story it was and is destined to be a classic in the American history literature."
3,Too distant!,"I always like all of Djavan offerings. This time he seems distant, alien to the camera. It was produced in a dark atmosphere, with a mistaken sense of intimacy...The music is superb, no doubt. But the film does not communicate his human side too well, in my opinion. The band looks detached, ""ajena""."
5,The Overcoming Life and Other Sermons of D.L. Moody,"I found this book to be very powerful. I could feel the presence of the Lord throughout the reading. If we had more ministers today that would tell the sheep what they needed to hear through the Word and not just pleasing things to the ears, the child of God would be guarding their Christian walk with the Lord better. Thank God for people like D.L. Moody, who spoke what the Lord wanted him to speak. SGW"
1,Too little info,There are dozens of tapes/dvds out there that teach more than 2-3 moves!Not worth the money.
4,Great voices Great songs,"I love this album. The first thing that struck me about the album besides Mike Brown's ability to create great songs was the vocals of Vance Chapman. The timbre and tone of his voice are distictive and unforgetable. Vance also has a great vocal range. It's apparant in all of his vocal work. Grand Pianist, Wake up Jimmy, I Shall Call her Mary to name just a few.I do not completely understand why this album did not do better commercially. Perhaps a more eye catching cover? The back side of the record was actually a bit more interesting.This is one record I can play from start to finish without skipping tracks and it is a favorite."
2,Bland band,"Despite Michael Brown's involvement, this is just a failure. There is no excitement anywhere on these sessions. The Left Banke's two albums are great, but Brown's abandoning the Banke for this really seems like a step down. I've had this on vinyl and got rid of it, bought it on CD thinking maybe I'll like it this time, but no, there is just nothing going on here even remotely close to what The Left Banke did. Subtlety is one thing, but boredom is another. Montage is mostly the latter. It's not terrible, but there is a reason it bombed commercially; it's mediocre. And the cover art is just as unmemorable as the music. I disagree with another reviewer about the second Left Banke album, minus Brown (except for one track.) I think it's better than the first. But Montage? I'll pass (again)."
4,Montage,"Montage was made at a time when Left Banke keyboardist and songwriter Brown had left the group. He teamed up with the Montage group as the principal songwriter and played keyboard as well. It has sparks of genius and manages to recapture bright moments of that early Left Banke baroque rock, including its sensitive outlook to romantic entanglements. Along with parts of the second album of the mother group--""Left Banke Too""--it's as close as you'll get to the original sound. Brown had moments of greatness and he almost gets there on Montage. A worthy recording for fans of Brown."
2,Blank Movie!,"I finally found a movie worse than ""Lady Godiva Rides"".The actors and actresses in this movie must have worked for free. Marsha Jordan getting undressed was the highlight of the moviebut they killed her off too early.The actor and male stars must have been handymen at the studio who decided to be actors. Georgia's husband was horrible. The step daughter was just as bad.If you can find a plot to this movie go public with it.Thismovie is even worse than ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"".Don't buy this movie,find one and steal it."
3,questionable build quality,"I ordered this from Amazon after reading several good reviews. Since this scale was designed with the help from the folks at King Arthur Flour, that also affected my decision. It arrived well packed, with no significant damage to the shipping box. The box for the scale was fine too. However, when I removed the scale from the box the stainless top fell off. The top had become detached from the cylindrical shaft extending from the body. There was a good amount of some kind of adhesive on the top of the shaft but it apparently hadn't adhered very well to the top plate. Amazon made the return process easy, however they weren't able to send a replacement since they were out of stock. I haven't decided to order one again yet, based on my experience."
4,most accurate scale,"I own two of these; one for at home and I keep one at my son's restaurant for when I bake. They are quite accurate and you would be amazed at how inaccurate your measuring cups and spoons are! Did you know that 1 cup of sugar is 7 ounces?! There is a list of foods that are numbered that come with it and all you do is put in a number - 58 is butter or cream - set volume or lbs./ounces/grams and put in your ingredients. You can keep adding more to it by clearing the number, type in the new ingredient number, tare the weight and keep going. This is for liquid or dry and you can do both in the same bowl. I set my filled cake pans or bread pans on it to make sure that I have equal amounts in each pan. Print out a couple of the lists and have them around; mine get pretty messy!I did have trouble with one of them once; the number 9 wouldn't come up so I called them and I sent it back in the box (so keep it and the insides that it comes in), and they sent me a new one right away."
3,Not for trip-planning,"Interesting, charming inside look with ""real Italy"" flavor. Enjoyed the flavor of this DVD, but more a personal documentation than trip-planning resource."
1,KAYE ON COLUMBIA,"The CD title is ridiculous. (The above review is also ridiculous. The song she refers to isn't even on the collection. Amazon, do you read these?)Why devote 25 cuts called ""the Collection"" to the 3 years at the end of Kaye's career? Granted Harbor Lights was a biggie, but Kaye had 13 years of RCA/Victor hits before then, massive hits, including Don Cornell & Billy Williams as the singers. And Eddie Cantor had a charted song with the band in this same period, which is missing.Overpriced and over hyped..at least all the cuts were real singles, and the liner notes were complete. Don't be fooled by the title. Between this one and ""Best of the Big Bands"", with only 6 charted songs out of the 41 cuts on the CDs, and skipping 97 other charted songs of the band, Columbia is selling Columbia, not Sammy Kaye.The only two Sammy Kaye CDs on Amazon worth the money are ""21 Best"" and ""Kaye on Vocalion"""
3,Strange book.,This book is very strange. I had to read it for a literature course. It was a good book but really out there!
3,"Great Monitor, but expensive",Pros:Huge screen area.Unlike most flat screen monitors this one has adjustable viewing angle AND HEIGHT!Sharp Resolution from 1024 X 768 to 1600 x 1200Included both Analog and Digital signal cablesCons:High PriceAwkward controls
3,Not The Best,I have had a number of ViewSonic LCD Monitors over the years and this one seemed a bit off in the color & brightness/contrast department. I have a VP2030b which I prefer. The D-SUB & DVI-A/D connectors and height adjustment are handy.
2,Do you know Ace was alost married?,The Doctor and Ace end up in too nice place.The Doctor runs off to find a book.(so he says)Ace becomes ingaged to a man who just happendsto be a pyrocenitic. The Doctor kills herfiance to save the universe.This book didn't stick to the Sylvester McCoycharacter. The Doctor in this bookcame out looking too much like an evil maniacwho dosen't care about the truth.
4,A classic,"This volume contains the poem ""Sea Fever,"" one of mine (and most people's) all-time favorites. I didn't find many other pieces in here to enjoy. Doesn't matter, it's a lovely old book and a treasure."
4,Wonderful Fantasy story,"I cannot believe no one has written a review of this neat little book. It is an eerie and romantic story of an island stuck in time and a young girl who has leukemia and not expected to live very long. Her Uncle and loved Aunt have bought the Island and plan to turn it into a tourist resort after the family spend a month there in a sort of family house party. There is much wonderful fresh air, good home cooking and everything one would want on an ocean isle. A couple, the Leamings, have lived in a little shack on the island for the last 50 years, but no one has seen them as they are very shy and withdrawn. I loved the dark puzzle of the island and its inhabitants and the ending was very surprizing."
4,Good and a half,"How you feel about Cyrkle depends what you are expecting. The band recorded Paul Simon's ""Red Rubber Ball"" in 1966. A delicious pop tune, perhaps too chipper for Simon and Garfunkel, but a perfect slice of melodic AM pop.Neon does not contain this track. Nor does it have a track as brilliant. Most of this is jangly pop, or ballads played by the band with little orchestration. Nothing here is bad, but has the bite of ""Red Rubber Ball."" The bonus tracks are actually better than the proper album ones, featuring some pop soul and a beautiful instrumental boss nova.As an album, you may find pieces of Neon a little nondescript, but if you are curious, you may find it enjoyable."
2,"Fine, if you're a snob with an unlimited budget. And you care more about what people think than how much fun they're having.","This book should be entitled, ""How to Plan the Ultimate Party where money is no object if you can afford everything except the party planner"". Or ""Party Planning for rich jerks by snobby designers.""Parties are about the creativity of the host! Not engraved invitations."
2,Good idea but poor quality,"We purchased two of these, seeing them at a recent campout. The idea isGREAT (the reason for the two stars). The quality is extremely poor (the reason for only two stars). For instance:1> One of the shelters we received was *obviously* used but sold asnew (probably not Amazon's issue since it was sent directly fromColeman). There were large sections of paint missing from thepoles. Some of the poles were bent. The ""springs"" used to holdthe ends of the poles into the connectors were bent. This unitwe returned immediately.2> The second shelter was new. However, on disassembly, the anchorsfor the elastic cords holding the poles together easily poppedout on about 20% of the poles. As much as I like these shelters,we are preparing to return this one as well.In short, stay away from these until Coleman solves their quality issues!"
4,Coleman 14 event shelter - I like it.,"I bought it at a Coleman outlet store in GA on my to camp in the NC mountains for a week. I put it up myself and only needed help to get each of the 2nd legs clipped in to the feet. (I'm a smallish woman) Had trouble getting some of the poles apart afterward, then a friend suggested gently tapping the opposite end of the pole with a hammer,and that worked. In a heavy rain the center vent dripped, but the thing is big enough 5 of us could easily stay away from the center. A small tarp over the top would have fixed that. We hung 8x10 tarps to cover the sides and that worked just fine. The guy camped next to me had one too--his shock cords had come out but he just put it up anyway. 14x14 is a nice amount of floor space, and my 6'4"" husband can comfortably stand in it. Down side is I think Coleman has discontinued it and parts may be hard to get."
3,"love the shelter, poles and carrying bag broke","I love this shelter for the most part. It isn't too hard to put up, and looks great. Works great in the rain, since rain runs off the corners and not through the middle.However, I've used it probably five or six times, and already three of the steel cables that hold the pieces poles together have broken.Worse, the carrying bag is totally useless now. It has torn to shreds. In fact, the handle broke off the first time I used it. And now the whole side is torn off of the bag.I have been pretty gentle with it, so it's not from rough handling"
4,Modern music 4 seasons style,"not quite as classic-sounding as the original ""December 1963(Oh, what a night)"" song, but very catchy. Great re-mix versions of ""Silver Star"" and ""Who Loves You""."
3,Pretty Good Effort,"First and most important know that is is notGreatest Hits, Vol. 1with Frankie Valli. If you are looking for those oldies check out other titles. This is the Four Seasons as a solo act and includes their versions of some old Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons classics. Armed with that knowledge you can then determine if this is the album you are looking for. Both of the versions of Oh What A Night on this album are dance beat versions and while the original Valli version was a great song, I also like to have the up tempo dance versions for a more lifting atmosphere."
1,disapointed,"I bought a CD. Unfortunately all the songs are in Mono, all sound channels through left speaker only. Completely useless cd.i would send it back, but it is too much work."
2,DISGRACEFUL DVD RELEASE!!!!!,"This is such an excellent film, I hate to give this low rating, but it is due entirely to the absolutly horrid DVD release from Rhino. This was an episode from ""Climax"". On this DVD, they have actually replaced all the original beginning and ending titles with their own. While the DVD looks sharper than the VHS, the VHS is completely original with all titles and commercials. If I had to chose, I'd take the VHS."
2,Boring with Poor Sonics,I was really disappointed with this SACD. The arrangements were uninspiring and the sonics were not what I expect from SACDs.
4,An Oscar Peterson Composition,"Here we have a CD on the Telarc Jazz label of a Suite of compositions by Oscar Peterson and played by Oscar with the Trio accompanied by the strings of the Michel Legrand Orchestra. It's subtitled A Canadian Suite and the titles and inspiration for the 12 movements are taken from various locations in Canada. Some of the movements are dreamy and romantic; others are in more of an up-tempo jazz vein. But the whole work never strays far from what could be called easy listening. The Oscar Peterson Quartet on this occasion comprises Oscar on piano of course, Ulf Wakenius on guitar, Niels Henning-rsted Pedersen on bass and Martin Drew on drums. This is a thoroughly enjoyable, relaxing and original 52 minutes of music.Oscar Peterson and Nelson Riddle"
4,Ridiculous!,"My 8 yr old son bought this with his birthday money and after 20 minutes became very frustrated because it had him in the ""Team Formation"" setup part over and over. I finally tried and even with the directions (and a graduate degree), it took me over 30 min to get out of the setup loop and actually START the game. It was utterly ridiculous!! A child's video game should not be so involved and should not have 38 steps you have to go through before you can actually begin play."
2,This game is nothing special,"Well, if you liked Pokemon, you'll probably slightly enjoy this game, but to all else, the Rokusho game hardly qualifies for mediocre. But if you feel like shelling out the [$$$] for this piece of [junk], do it with little expectation. I hope I have kept you from utterly disappointing yourself, PEACE OUT!"
4,Great classic British political humor,this film hasn't dated badly. this wonderful ensemble of actors in their youth doing a great job delivering political satire
1,"I like the music, but this cd is terrible","Why only 1 star and why do I say this cd is terrible? The mastering, that's why. This cd is so thin and shrill sounding that it's difficult to listen to. The original edition of this disc (before it got labeled with ""digitally remastered from the original tapes"" or something like that) was no sonic masterpiece, but it definitely sounded better than this. I would really, really discourage anyone thinking about this disc.For a good hits collection, the newer 2-disc ""Essential Barbra Streisand"" disc is good. It sounds SO much better than this disc and contains most of the tracks available on this disc (and many, any others)."
4,Volume 2,"This compilation covered her career from 1970 to 1978. It went on to sell 5 million copies in the US alone. The one new song became a signature ballad for her, of course I'm referring to ""You Don't Bring Me Flowers"" with Neil Diamond. A classic AC ballad. 9 other hits fill up the collection. This was an interesting time in her career where she experimented with various styles (as always, as she still continues to do so). Other big hits include ""Evergreen"", ""The Way We Were"", ""Superman"", ""My Heart Belongs To Me"", ""Stony End"", and more. I give it 4 stars because the sound quality is not that great on this cd, so hopefully it gets remastered."
5,soothing,"WOW! What a lovely album truely deserving the title Greatest Hits. I love to listen to this album when I go to bed it's so soothing and I love music I can fall asleep to. Some of the standouts are My heart belongs to me, All in love is fair and of course Evergreen and The way we were. This album is one of my all time favorites!"
5,Great CD,"This is a great CD. If you like Barbra Streisand, you will love this. It's some of her best songs."
5,This was a big hit at our daughter's wedding!,"Our daughter has been obsessed with purple since she was a little girl (she drives a Purple Haze Mini Cooper, usually wearing a purple coat of some sort) so it was no surprise when purple was the predominant color chosen for her wedding this summer. My wife found a lovely gown that fit the them but I was perplexed about how to tie this into my classic black tux until I found this perfect accessory here on Amazon."
5,Darling Prayer book for babies and Mom,How can you go wrong with this lovely and beautifully put together book of prayers and scripture. The illustrations are incredible and precious. They are so full of love and absolutely perfect for babies and young toddlers. Moms love them too! My little ones were just captured by the darling illustrations and loved the sing song prayers and beautiful verses.....makes the perfect gift and addition to any nursery!
3,"Neat idea, handled poorly.","This movie's plot is a really neat and original one. Teens go on a boat ride and the boat sinks, trapping them on an island where there's a nice hotel that is decked out with Christmas decorations. Turns out the hotel/island is trapped in time on New Years Eve 1959 because of some experiment that the government was conducting. Neat idea, right? But this is where the coolness ends. Random monsters attack the people and it makes little sense. The makeups are poor. There is little gore. But stiill, the idea was good, it was just handled poorly. Another highlight is the original music by CRY NO MORE, esp the opening sequence with 50's party footage set to their song ""Recipie for Romance"". Also, the box art itself... with the partying skeleton... is great to have for your collection."
4,"Low budget, but strangely compelling","Norman J Warren's last film to date is a guilty pleasure. A group of kids have a fight in a fairground and find themselves on a boat heading out to an island. However, the island is deserted apart from strange, invisible ghosts and haunted cinema screens...It's a low budget affair, with unknown actors & some special effects that are clearly done on a budget - but's its also a bit offbeat & rattles along at a nice pace. Despite the obvious constraints on the budget, the film's atmosphere is quite strange. I lost my old VHS copy years ago, and can't wait for the DVD!Music was by Nick Magnus, who has worked with Steve Hackett and various other well known artists, and the songs are by the group ""Cry No More."" This group consisted of two ex-members of the Stawbs (One who was a strawb for a brief period only!) and Magnus himself."
5,I Ain't No Music Critic But..........,This is the best female reggae release I have ever heard. I got this on cassette back in the nineties; but the machine ate it. A must have for anyone who loves conscious music!!Russell S.
1,"If you want to learn a language, look elsewhere!","If you want to learn one of the languages in this book, run, don't walk, as far away from it as possible! I was interested in learning Italian, French, and Spanish, so I ordered the book. Luckily I speak fluent German, so by browsing through the book, I could get a fairly good idea about the quality of the text. Within ten minutes, I had found over 25 SERIOUS vocabulary, spelling, and grammar mistakes in the German sections! Needless to say, this did not exactly fill me with confidence about the quality of the rest of the book! I feel great pity for anyone who tries to learn German from this book, and I recommend that you steer clear of it!"
1,Glaring errors,"With glaring errors in three of the languages right on the cover, I wouldn't even consider purchasing this book: The French translation of the title uses the adjective ""facil"" where the adverb is required, the Italian translation uses ""ed"" instead of ""e"" to translate ""and"", and the Spanish translation misspells the word ""espanol"" as ""espagnol""!"
1,You can JUDGE this book by its cover,"Five languages made simpler in one book - HOW CONVENIENT !!! WHAT A NOVELTY !!! Too bad there are so many negligent errors on the cover of this book, because it could have been a great and convincing resource. I have not purchased this book and I would not be tempted to do so. Click on ""SEE LARGER PICTURE"" and notice how many serious spelling and grammatical errors there are right on its front cover.A sampling of some of the Spanish errors on cover:1)""grammática"" ( it should be spelled with one m )2)""espagñol"" (it should read español)A sampling of some of the Italian errors on cover:1) ""ed"" ( it should read ""e"" - you only add a ""d"" when the word that follows begins with a vowel)2) ""lingues"" ( the plural form of ""lingua"" is ""lingue"")There are MORE errors on the cover apart from these!!!If there are so many errors on the cover of this book, there are bound to be more inside. This book does not give a good first impression."
3,Mediocre Mish-Mash,"I bought this SACD in the hopes that it would make a good ""preview disc"" to show off the technology of my SACD player. Unfortunately, that is not what this CD is meant to do. Most songs feature only one or two instruments or the human voice, which is not where the SACD format stands out. Think of this CD as more of a ""Sample of Telarc's lineup"" than a ""Sample of SACD technology"". You will be hard-pressed to find more than two or three songs that you enjoy listening to.My recommendation for people looking at this this album is to look at the track list, find songs you are interested in, and buy the Telarc album the song came from. You will be much happier."
4,I like this SACD!,"I use the Philips 963SA to play this 6ch SACD & open all speakers,great sounding! Every channel is very clean/very clear,but if ""they"" add more bass that will be more better! Songs are pretty good! I give this sacd ""A-"" User please use the ""Multi-Channel Decoder"" to play,if not or use normal cd mode to play,the sound is very small & bad (just like a member CHIEN,CHIN-HUNG's description) I think he use a wrong method to play so this sacd cannot eductive all the things from the song! I highly recommend this cd to all sacd lover! Thank you!"
1,Not really a book.,"This reads like a propaganda piece. It is relentless, falacious, and the points made about the flaws in Kinsey's methods are drowned out in rhetoric.The Kinsey Report was a flawed study. Modern culture is often perverse and even horrifying.BUT the two have nothing to do with each other and the author of this book is nonsensical. Rather than trying to defend her moral, Christian, heterosexual way of life, she has spent her life attacking a decades-old report. It's a sturdy old windmill, that Kinsey Report.I'm glad I was leant this book and exercised the judgement of not buying it."
2,Historical Perspectives/Politcal Messages,"Gay Talese's work on his family's journey from Italy to America is an involved tale that delves into a difficult historical period for both the United States and Italy. Revolution, social upheaval, racism, and war color Talese's story from start to finish. These themes give the tale a characteristically depressing bent which tends to ramble in certain places. In addition, there is a decided social message which the author appears to be trying to put forth during the entire story. These perspectives, and those on Italian history, should be viewed in the context of interpretations of an Italian American writer and not be taken as those of traditional native Italian scholars. Still, the book is in a bold attempt at telling the story of one family's struggle, on both sides of the Atlantic, during the social upheaval of the twentieth century."
5,1979 Awesome year for music,"1979 was a great year for music and this wonderful album by Mr. Fogelberg was the best that year had to offer. This is the one that skyrocketed Dan into the stratosphere of pop music. Every song on here is a masterpiece.Get it today. If you've never heard it, you will love it. Every album Dan put out from 1972 thru 1982 were masterful works of art. If you only know him through his radio hits then you barely know him at all. Do yourself a favor and get this and all his others ones from the 70's. Heck, they're only 4.99!! Peace out."
3,"Not his best, but still enjoyable","The song ""Longer"" on this album might have cemented Fogelberg's reputation for sappy songs, and ""Face the Fire"" sounds dated, but it's still an album that bears occasional listening. ""Gypsy Wind"" and ""Further Along the Road"" are still guilty pleasures, with the latter one being especially poignant since his passing. This Japanese mini-sleeve remastered version boasts exquisite sound and the packaging is quite cute. Too bad they are so expensive, thanks to the weak dollar on the foreign exchange markets."
2,Something to Displease Everyone,"I followed Fogelberg's career from the debut in '72 though this title in '80 before finally giving up on him. Every album has a few great cuts but for someone more drawn to his rock 'n' roll side, the drippy ballads and folkish muzak just got to be too much to bear. On this, his sixth album, Fogelberg's stylistic swings reach the breaking point - he rocks harder on the songs ""Face the Fire"" and ""Phoenix"" than he ever has before, but with ""Longer"" and ""Heart Hotels"" he lets his sappy romantic side go way overboard as well. Hard to believe a fan of one side of Fogelberg can stomach the other. I recently burned my own ""Best of"" CD for Fogelberg - 2 or 3 songs from each of the first 6 albums. Now I'll sell the albums and never miss them a bit."
5,better than the books,They are very good books but I like the tape better. I really like the interview at the end.
1,BEWARE--contains different ingredient,"I got this product with different ingredient.They add a lot of new extra Vitamin and mineral like (B6, Folic Acid....)Original package only have extra Vitamin E and iron added.(just like Amazon picture)It's smelling after opening.After my one year old son ate, he became very hyper and keeping running circle in the house.I am not sure is this new formula? why don't they update the website picture, or I won't order it here.Now they are going to replace same products as website to me."
5,i like it,"I compare this to gerber,eb is more smooth than gerber and my son also like eb.but gerber contains more Zinc than eb"
5,My Babies Love It,Both my twin babies started eating solids this week and this is the first one we tried. Both are very happy eating Earth's Best Organic Whole Grain Rice Cereal. It's easy to mix with formula and we have no problem feeding it to them.
4,Good alternative to Gerber!,"I like that this cereal is made from brown rice and is organic. The only advice I would have is to use it quickly, as it liquefies if you wait too long to serve."
1,Contain cyanocobalamin dirty form of Vit B12,cyanocobalamin aka the dirtiest form of vitamin B12 is in the product.We wonder why cancer among kids is raising...we are not eating food anymorebut synthetic toxic crap.Despicable! Bought it ounce will never buy it again!You better off with an organic egg/yellow preferably from a real farmeranswer: methylcobalamin or even better hydroxocobalamin (that is the best of the best)Do not come and post a reply that tells me that cyanocobalamin is safe according to the FDA if you do not want to be flameddo you research and stop repeating like a parrot what other idiots are telling you.
2,BEWARE--contains undeclared soy,"My 6 month old son has allergic colitis with sensitivities to both dairy and soy. When we gave him Earth's Best Whole Grain Rice Cereal for infants (which does not list any milk or soy ingredients), he had a bad reaction, so I called the company to find out if the tocopherols (vitamin E) in the cereal are soy-based and they said ""yes"" even though the ingredients on the package say nothing about soy. We were very disappointed in Earth's Best for failing to protect babies with allergies/sensitivities. Fortunately our baby is OK now, and we've switched to HappyBellies cereal which is great and clearly labeled as dairy and soy free."
1,"Good movie, awful DVD","This is great movie. No doubt about it, but quality of DVD is horrible. Picture sometimes got blurred, sound is very low quality. This is worst DVD ever. Movie is more then worth to watch, but not from that DVD."
2,Great movie - worst DVD transfer ever,"Seriously: the sound is the worst I have encountered on any DVD release, a big part of the screen is covered with a dark grey box to cover the original subtitles - there is a lot of video jittery things going on, it all adds up to my conclusion that the DVD version is transfered from a very, very bad analog copy. On top of all, the subtitles are totally out of sync and awfully misspelled. Dont buy this unless you are a fanatic WKW fan who already own all other releases......"
1,Think twice about DVD version,"This is a spectacular film to behold. One of Wong Kar-Wai's best but the DVD transfer is the worse I have ever seen. No budget involved basically. Half of the frame is missing because of the subtitle bar. One can deal with the slight inaccuracies in translation but the subtitles aren't in sync with the images. Perhaps, buy the cheaper VHS edition if you are really desperate to own."
1,ASHES OF TIME DVD DISAPPOINTING,"It would be unfair to judge a film by a poor presentation, so I'll decline any comment about what I saw of the film itself. But this dvd is a big disappointment, especially considering the price. I think it's more than 20% of the picture that's matted out to hide the old subtitles; I think it's closer to 30 (several times you can see some of the old subtitles above the new ones). There's alot of picture missing and I frankly gave up watching this after a couple tries. At some point I'll finish, just to justify my purchase to myself. But I won't buy any more products from the company that put this one out, that's for sure."
1,Trying to be a Chinese-style Western movie. It does not work.,"It tries hard to be a Chinese-style Western. It does not work. Most of the scenes consist of desert, horses and swordmen. The plot is philosophical and deep but it's extremely choppy and dragging. The fighting scenes are below par compared to other good Kung-Fu films.In short, it's not fun to watch. It should be called ""Ashes of Movies"". If you like moody, deep and philosophical pictures, you might like it. I don't. I prefer to watch the ones that are entertaining first."
2,Fish Out Of Water,"There's no doubt that Wong Kar-Wai is a visionary director and accomplished storyteller. But Ashes of Time is to Wong Kar-Wai as Mallrats is to Kevin Smith, a slight blemish in an otherwise stellar career. Although Ashes of Time is a beautiful piece of film making and cinematography, it is an absolute turd of a movie. Jam packed with popular actors and pop stars who make Sophia Coppola look like an oscar winning actress, this film was in dire need of a few (major) script revisions. If Ashes of Time is the first Wong Kar-Wai film you've seen, don't write him off as a hack, Chungking Express, Fallen Angels and Happy Together are some of the best films to have come out of Hong Kong."
2,Not what I expected,This is not the usual hong kong movie that Im use to seeing Its very different with little fight scene. So dont expect crazy fight scene but looking just at the cover of the movie and the name does sound like its going to be like a fighting movie. So Im glad I rented this first so I wasnt stuck buying the movie.
2,A CHINESE SPAGHETTI WESTERN REMAKE OF 'LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD',"A Sino-samurai movie striving for style with random I CHING prophesy thrown in for dialog. It might play better in the theatre. It might look better on DVD or Blu ray. What I watched was an old VHS version that looked like a third generation dupe, practically no detail at all.That said, evidently some versions of this movie please some people. I have to admit, there is something there, I'm not too sure what. Imitation Morricone soundtrack kept me looking for Clint Eastwood in his poncho just over the next sand dune, but he never materialized.If I come across a used Blu ray of this I may give it another look. I'm not sure if I saw 'Ashes of Time', or the Redux version, the title on the cassette box was all in Chinese and on two tapes, even though the running time was only 100 minutes. Go figure."
1,alltime worst dvd release ever,"Make sure you read the review for that is rated 1 star up above. That person is not lying. So sorrRy if I get rude but this really pissed me off.THE REVIEWS AMAZON HAS SAYS THAT THE DISTRIBUTER IS CAV DISTRIBUTION. THE ONE THAT I GOT WAS THE FAMOUS WORLD DISTRIBUTION. I HAVE ALWAYS HAD SUCCESS FROM THEM BECAUSE THEY SOMEHOW GET THE RIGHTS FROM COMPANIES LIKE CELESTIAL!!!, TAI SENG, MAI EH, AND MANY OTHERS. I CANNOT COMMENT ON WHETHER OR NOT THIS MOVIE IS GOOD. I CANNOT EVEN COMMENT IF THE CAV DISTRIBUTION VERSION IS GOOD, WHAT I CAN SAY IS MAKE SURE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE BUYIGN BEFORE HAND. AND SINCE NOBODY IS ABLE TO COMMENT ON WHAT VERSION THEY GOT, I SUPPOSE I WILL BE THE LONER HERE. SO ONCE AGAIN, I HAVE THE WORLD MEDIA SOMETHING. AND IF SOMEBODY FINDS A GOOD VERSION OF THIS, CAN YOU PLEASE POST IT? I HAVE HEARD NOTHING BUT GOOD REVIEWS FOR THIS MOVIE, ANYBODY WANT TO TELL ME WHAT DVD VERSION YOU HAVE SITTING ON YOUR SHELF?"
1,The Worst DVD masterring I've ever seen! A Disaster!,"This is a horrorible disaster for the movie, the director and viewers. I can't believe that there exists a DVD company which produces this kind of work and puts it in market with any expectation of business.I know some Hong Kong DVD producers are not much concerned about the quality of works, but it is just beyond my expectation. The worst DVD mastering I've ever seen, and I don't think there would be any worse than this in the future. The No.1 DVD you should never buy, see, or ever try to!"
2,Ashes of Time (on DVD) poor quality,"For huge fans only.The quality of this DVD is terrible. Not widescreen. The video hasn't been cleaned up. Not SurroundSound... not even in stereo. It looks like it was dubbed from a second-hand video library video.Ashes of Time is one of my most favourite movies. A multi-award winning movie (14th HK film awards). From a director who won the cannes film festival (for Happy Together). To see it produced with so little respect makes me very sad. It is a crime against humanity.If someone would let me, I would personally spend weeks restoring the video for free. This movie deserves better."
1,Boring movie,I generally love Wuxia ancient martial arts movies that are packed w/ beautiful acrobatic fighting sequences. This one really disappoints in this respect. I had to stop watching part way 'cause I couldn't stand the blurring of the fight scenes and the oh so slow pacing. This is action/martial arts for heaven's sakes. And the over the top intellectual/deep stuff comes off as too pretensious.Waste of time.
1,Waste time and money,"Don't get me wrong, I do like the cast of the movie. However,the script Sucks Big Time!!! It's one of the worst movies ever made. Waste my time and waste my money!!!"
5,An exceptionaly refreshing devotional!,"This book is a very refreshing devotional on the book of Job. It is written exceptionally well, just like every other work Henry Morris has published. Take a look at the wonderful book of Job from a new perspective. Examine both the scientific and theological aspects of Job. Learn about how Job describes the Ice Age (during which time he lived) and dinosaurs! I highly recommend this book to any born again Christian!"
5,A take on Job I had never heard of before I agree with it.,"We have all heard of ""unmerited Grace"" but have you ever heard of ""unmerited suffering""? Read the book, so many theologians always find fault with Job as a person and what he said but GOD didn't."
1,Propaganda,"This is not a serious book on the civil wars in the Balkans but a propaganda product produced by the Croatian government (Croatian Information Service, Zagreb) under Tudjman.Do not buy this book unless you are interested in a modern day example of Goebbels propaganda!"
3,Good Ol' Ronnie Wood,"Very solid release from everybody's favorite guitar sidekick. Good songs, great guitar licks and Ronnie's everyman vocals. I bought this on CD a few years ago and the production is god-awful. It is long overdue to be remastered. Maybe it's the transfer to CD and maybe it's the mix. I don't know enough about it to explain it properly, but the sound quality is one of the worst I've ever heard. And this album deserves much better than that, because it is very good. While I still feel ""I've Got My Own Album To Do"" is his best effort (and one of my all time favorite albums)this is still worth owning for the converted. Three stars, should be four, but knocked down one for the production/sound quality/mix."
2,Old fan's comment,"Being an old fan, I felt like adding some musical memories to my Ipod play lists. Last time I played the vinyl album was some 30 years ago. After re listening to the whole CD album I only imported three tracks. I'd reckon you go straight to ""Breaking My Heart"", ""Seven days"" and possibly ""Lost and Lonely"". Musically you can live whithout the CD in your collection.PGB"
3,for completists only,"I own most of ron wood's albums, and this is the weakest. His best albums are I've got my own album to do and slide on this live. Now look is different and has a nice ""soul"" touch to it. This one is rather bland compared to those."
5,lLA MODERNA TRADICION GOZA CONMIGO,"THE BEST CUBAN MUSIC YOU CAN HEAR ,MEJOR MUSICA CUBANA QUE LA QUE SE GRABA EN LA ISLA DE CUBA .HAS ELEMENT OF JAZZ,SONGO,RUMBA ,GUAGUANCO,DANZON,CHA CHA SON,COMPARSA,NO LE FALTA NA,MERECE 100 STARS"
5,perfect trauermusik,"This was an amazing recording!!! Mr. Dean tone is flawless, and the recording of Trauermusik is incredible!!! Such rich, emotional playing! I have never heard better.Now, to Allan whatshisface ""zallan"":when you review a CD, you are supposed to comment on the record quality, and the artists playing. NOT what you think about the composer and contemporary music. If you don't like it, don't review it! People who are looking at the CD are probably looking at the CD because they LIKE the composer's music. Let the people who like it give a REAL critique! And if you think that the Op. 36 sounds like screaching, then it's time for you to have a hearing check."
4,The Soul of Adulthood,"I bought this for my son, who is trying to be a father to an 18-year-old girl. I read it first, and found myself in several of the cases described. Overall, the book rambles, but there are flashes of excellent insight."
4,Great songs and great group,"Paul Revere and the Raiders were another great 1960's group. This CD covers most of their hits, but even though it was made covering the hits before ""Indian Reservation,"" a Paul Revere and the Raiders Greatest Hits album is not complete without that song on it. They do a great job on ""Louie, Louie,"" sometimes I think it's better than the original. ""Just Like Me"" is a great tune as well. Only thing keeping this CD from 5 stars is it is missing ""Indian Reservation."""
3,paul revere CD,The CD transaction was perfect with regard to shipping to my house and the product was packed nice and safe. The CD skips on certain songs and they are the ones I like the best. I will take this as a lesson learned from buying slightly 'used' items. I still haven't tried the CD's in a newer type CD player but they skip on computer and CD player.
5,WOW,"I'd forgotten why Paul Revere and the Raiders were my favorite group, way back when I was a teenager in the 60's. I had this album then, and loved it, this CD sounds just as fresh as I remember. Great group,Fantastic CD."
4,Cherokee People?,"Why not Indian Reservation instead of I'm Not Your Stepping Stone. That was a Monkees hit anyway. Good Thing, Kicks, Hungry and Just Like Me are as good as anyone and they really rock."
4,paul revere,So glad I could find this music from my past & be able to put my favorites onto my IPOD. AWESOME !!!
3,Very Good ... But It Could Be Better,"This is a very good CD, but it would be better if ALL of the group's greatest hits were on the disc. But for what I purchased it for it serves me fine."
4,Wow,"I discovered Paul Revere & the Raiders growing up by raiding my cousin's singles and LP collection from the 1960s. Not having heard Kicks, Hungry or the Legend of Paul Revere for 20 years or so, I bought this CD purely on a whim to replace the orginal LP. Glad I did. The Songs sound better today (thanks, other reviewers, about the warnings about remixed albums) and brought back a lot of great memories. Go ahead and buy it, you'll be glad you did. The bonus tracks are great, too (I had Peace of mind on a prerecorded cassette)."
1,Ick. The two best songs were left out.,"The two best songs were left out. Kicks, and Indian Reservation. You don't know the raiders until you have heard these two songs. Choose a different album."
4,Decent Alternative to All-Clad,"I bought this set for my oldest daughter, who wanted a clad stainless set that does not have glass lids. As far as I know, she loves it, and I totally agree with her about glass lids. I wasn't overly impressed with the design of the handles on this set, so I chose the Cuisinart MultiClad Pro set for myself. I guess I'm overly picky and spoiled from using my beloved Belgique Gourmet set (made in Belgium) for the past 25 years. I haven't been able to find that same quality in the newer Belgique, and All-Clad is prohibitively expensive. I also considered Marcus Samuelsson, but there are very few reviews of that cookware and I have a very low opinion of Revere Ware (the company that makes the Marcus Samuelsson line)."
2,Be Informed!,"Be informed! This product is Made in China. Yes, the land of low quality, cheap and often illegal knock offs. This cookware set is way too expensive (even discounted) for where it was made. Enough said."
3,Where is this set made?,Someone posted that this set is made in China - is that correct? I have been looking all over the internet to find out where this cookware set is made. I have a set of Henckels from years ago but they are made in Germany. Now I may be back to the drawing board to find a great set not made in China! It's too bad because this looks like such a nice set. . . the only set that I have come across is All Clad but no rolled edges and of course $$ .. . Calphalon has glass lids which I do not want . . . any idea's??
3,Good History Book,"This is a well written, thoroughly researched and interesting history book. However, this book is a wealth of misinformation about handguns.By page 166 I started keeping track and found 14 incorrect statements about firearms. Two examples: The author states that the cylinder of the British Bulldog Revolver has to be removed for ejection and loading. Factually it has a loading gate on the right side and a swing out ejection rod stored in the cylinder pin. He also states Colt's New Service Revolver was introduced in 1909. Colt brought it out in 1898.So, one star for handguns and five stars for history. I settled on three stars."
2,VERY MISDLEADING,Says and shows entire lift kit...the only thing that came was the springs. Not Happy that I wasted my money on springs!
4,good looking,the shoe is very good looking ..but unfortunately my wide feet it fits a little snug & the heel a little too high for me ..but i love steve madden shoes ..
5,"If the world read this book and followed it,",there would be no more wars or feuds.IT'S THE ART OF LOVING WELL !
4,classic samurai,"A very good samurai film. Classic honor vs money/greed/power tale with interesting characters on all sides. Worth watching. I liked a more recent film called ""Twilight Samurai"" even better. Check it out, a masterpiece."
2,"uh, have to be a film historian to like this","competent Japanese spaghetti western that goes nowhere, like The Seven Samurai Lite, that is even complementing it, It is nowhere as good as the Seven Samurai and many, many others of this genre. Lots of good sword play, mugging, shrieking, ultimately flat and nothing is accomplished.I felt abused since I bought this on the basis of positive reviews."
5,Yet Another Great Heart CD,"DOG & BUTTERFLY is yet another great Heart CD, continuing the band's blend of Zeppelinesque metal, Outlaws-style Southern boogie, and Fairport Convention-style folk-rock. It features some great rockers (""Cook With Fire"", ""High Time""), mystical numbers (""Mistral Wind""), ballads (the title track), and a disco song (""Straight On"") that's far better than some other rockers' attempts at disco, more like the Rolling Stones' ""Miss You"" than Rod Stewart's ""Do Ya Think I'm Sexy."" If you buy this CD along with DREAMBOAT ANNIE, LITTLE QUEEN, BEBE LE STRANGE, GREATEST HITS (Epic/Legacy), JUPITER'S DARLING, ALIVE IN SEATTLE, and THE ESSENTIAL 3.0 HEART, you won't be disappointed. Guitarist Roger Fisher would leave after this album, but from the sound of the music, it didn't seem possible at the time."
4,Heart: DOG & BUTTERFLY (1978),"In 1978, Heart had released their fourth album entitled, DOG & BUTTERFLY. With this album, Heart seemed to be getting bigger and better with their extroadinary talents. This album is still not as good as DREAMBOAT ANNIE and LITTLE QUEEN, but this album still ranks high with the first two albums, in my opinion, and this album is also the last album Heart would do under the direction of Portrait Records.COOK WITH FIRE (Live)Not a bad song.HIGH TIMEGreat.HIJINXGreat.STRAIGHT ONThe first single from the album. A great hard rock song.DOG & BUTTERFLYThe second & final single from the album. This is one of their prettiest ballads. A great song here.LIGHTER TOUCHGreat.NADA ONENot bad.MISTRAL WINDHell of a tune.This album, although not as great, is still a worthy album. I just want to point out that this album was the last album that Lead Guitarist, Roger Fisher, will ever be featured on. But this is still an album worth buying."
3,Middle of the road Heart.,"Heart ""Dog & Butterfly"" #17 (1978).The third album by Heart ""Dog & Butterfly, is a real disappointment after the truly excellent ""Little Queen"". Just too many acoustic numbers and lack hearted rock tunes. they only standouts were, ""Straight On"" #15, and ""Cook With Fire"", the only acoustic number that passed my ears test was ""Mistral Wind"", the albums other hit was the title track #34, which I just never enjoyed. They would hit the studio again late 1979 and come back with a winner in 1980's ""Bebe Le Strange""."
3,A Middling Heart Album,"""Dog & Butterfly"" was the third Heart album, following the far suprior ""Dreamboat Annie"" and ""Little Queen."" It marked the beginning of a decline that would culminate with the band losing its record contract in the early 1980s. The title track is a first rate ballad and ""Straight On"" is a fine radio hit, but after that there isn't much to hang your hat on. The first two tracks are live recordings of inferior quality and the remaining four are decent but unspectacular filler material. Additionally, at a total of only eight songs, this is a pretty slight effort. Casual listeners would be better off with any of Heart's Greatest Hits albums."
2,BRGARY,THIS WASN'T THE BEST WORK I'VE SEEN FROM HEART I AM A BIG FAN OF HEART'S BUT I THING DREAM BOAD ANNY WAS MUST BETTER WORK THAN WHAT I FOUND ON THIS PIECE OF MUSIC ON THIS CD
5,Simply the Perfect Album,"It's hard to believe I first bought this album over 20 years ago. It still sounds as fresh to me as it did then. This CD represents 6 incredible players at their peak, and is a must for any music fan. ""Mistral Wind"" is simply the most amazing blend of songwriting, musicianship, and studio expertise you will ever hear. Nothing in over 20 years has come close. It's a tragedy that guitar virtuoso Roger Fisher was gone after this record, because they never reached this level of recording excellence after. If you don't have this CD, buy it. You'll never be sorry."
3,Dog & Butterfly,"This is Heart at their finest at least on three cuts. Straight on is powerful, high energy and highlights Anne Wilson's vocal range. Nada One and Mistral Wind are the Wilson sisters at their mystical best lyrically."
3,"I really only enjoy the ""butterfly"" portion","Only a few songs stand out to me on this CD, and that's everything past, and including, ""Dog and butterfly"". These are some beautiful songs. I started listening to Heart during their big-haired glam 80's days, so I had to travel back to appreciate this CD. And while I prefer the pop-synth 80's variety of Heart, ""Dog and Butterfly"" does have it's charms as well."
5,Mad Professor at his best,"This is a real gem and album that must be on your hit list. The superb sounds on this vibe is magic. Back in the 70's when a house party was in session you could here dub like this.Make a cup of tea, sit back, relax and enjoy."
2,Overwrought,"This album is far from classic. The delays, phases etc are not used with any degree of subtelty, but worst of all, the musicians which layed down the tracks were not on the vibe. I don't know yet, but having listened to the Scientist's early 80's releases, I've a feeling that the vibe was dead by this time. I guess this album is alright if you are seventeen and you get off on grating sounds when you're stoned. Not for the serious listener."
5,Lester pointers to what is.,"Very helpful to everyone who likes to experience what is beyond all ego-wanting.Discover what you ultimatly are and definitly not.Love, Happiness, Freedom.I am."
2,Glib... but vague,"This ""ultimate"" truth is vague. Lester speaks of ""God"" and how absolute truth and God are the same thing but provides little supporting insight. In fact, this book is just about useless as far as I'm concerned. The chapters are divided into different subjects, and each chapter is essentially 20-30 quotes by Lester; they don't follow a particular flow or go into much depth-- they're just quaint little sayings that are supposed to be the ultimate truth. At the end of this book are pages of advertisements for other books by the author with prices and ""reviews"" by famous people trying to get you to buy something. Read something else. Read Krishnamurti or Anthony Demello. Read Siddhartha or Summerhill."
3,Not as good...,"With as many batteries as I use, I may be heading for record breaking status. And I have found that Duracell lasts longer in the C and D sizes. I do like Energizer best for AAA and AA."
3,Great!,Gino's voice is out of this world. I am trying to find out which of his CDs has the the song into the night. I seem to love that song and have no idea which of his cds has it. Help! anyone. All of his music is so cool. His voice is awsome!
4,One of his best,"Nightwalker is quintessential Gino. The first 3 tracks I feel are some his very best---passionate and beautifully sung. ""Living inside myself"" was the popular song from this album, but not one of the better songs from the album (similar to ""I just want to stop"" on the Father and Son album). You would not go wrong purchasing this CD-although it is a bit pricy!"
5,Nice audio engineering and sonic quality.,"""Nightwalker"" by Gino Vannelli is an album with a lot of syncopated rhythms and funk. Tracks like ""Seek and You Will Find,"" ""Santa Rosa,"" ""Nightwalker,"" and ""I Believe"" are really interesting. If Gino would only get back into the groove again. His last two jazz albums are nice, but they put me to sleep. I enjoyed his music more when it was up-tempo and got people moving, like with ""People Gotta Move"" on his Powerful People album. That is how he started, energetic, but I guess in his older age he is mellowing out, but I'm not. Take care, Gino, and let's hear something with LIFE. John R. in Dallas"
4,The only thing out there!,Not bad! Basic overview and some indepth detail. CD included doesn't really help to much. Worth the risk
2,Not a programmer's book or an administrator's book !,"This book is OK for someone who is just getting into site server. In other words, this will get u off the ground, but wont teach u to fly ! Not much in terms of programmer stuff. But it does help to have this book in the first couple of weeks to get the concepts straight especially since microsoft doesn't give hard copies of the manuals yet. Also good for asking newcomers into the project to read thru."
1,You'll be SORRY....,"I purchased this book and read it form cover to cover. You will learn some things but ""Bible"" is far from the truth. Look for the red professional series books by Wrox, they get better ratings. This was one of the first Site Server 3 books and it does not cover enough, not to mention certain sections were cut and pasted... Try one of the newer books..!"
1,Cheaper and better with the on-line help,"Print out the Word documents enclosed on the CD. It gives you more useful info. As a decisionmaker, this book should be great, because it's only schratching the surface of all the good features included in this platform and software"
2,This is a Read Once Type of Book,"If Microsoft would get their act together and publish books on their own software that would be both compelling and thorough, we would not have to resort to buying other books (techno-bibles and the like) that should not be bought at all. I will like it very much if someone would publish a comprehensive read on how Site Server works business-to business."
3,"Good installation guide, not very deep","The book provides a pretty good guide to the installation of Site Server features, but stops short of being really useful in developing with Site Server or continuing administration using the product. Site Server is a large enough product to require numerous volumes for proper coverage; calling this product a ""Bible"" might be a little much. However, it's a good installation resource and basic guide to the features."
2,Good overview but not enough detail,"SiteServer 3.0 deserves a thorough write-up. This book ain't it. While Harris does give a good tour of the product, he doesn't go into nearly enough detail. The search section, for example, is a measly 30 pages, and most of those are filled with unnecessary screen shots. I really don't need to see what the web page he's talking about looks like...I can go see it for myself. All that page space would have been better filled with descriptions of what you can do with search and how to do it.I think the problem is that SiteServer 3.0 is too big to cover in a single volume. A 3-volume set -- Overview/Install; Knowledge; and Commerce -- would be better. Still waiting for that."
1,not overly impressed,"Too much fluff, not much substance. Site Server 3 ""Bible"" is a poor title. maybe ""Installing"" Site Server 3 would have been better. Example: Harris states there are 3 ways to administer SS3, one way is through a command line. He takes 2 pages to show you how to get a command prompt, and then says, ""for more info, consult the online Site Server Documentation"". No commands, nothing. No joke."
2,Done too fast...,"In one word: disappointing. Microsoft provides a number of tutorials on the site that are equally good. When the going gets tough, this book just stops. Site Server is an amazing product, and this book doen't go past the 2000 pages that microsoft provides on the product CD...This is the first book on Site Server, let hope some better ones follow..."
3,Useful to Answer the Question...,"What is Site Server?You would think that Microsoft would answer this question for free :-). But navigating the HTML help that comes with SiteServer is best done when you know what you are looking for.I found this book a good overview, and it certainly had enough screenshots (!!!). Now I have a better grasp of the scope of the Site Server features.Not a earth-shattering, mind-rocking, paradigm-shifting book, however. Site Server deserves one."
2,Nothing usefull in the book,Very disappointing. Not much in the book. Basically bunch of screen shots in the book.
1,You can't get worse!,"This book is simply terrible. There is nothing simple about setting up and managing a commerce site with Site Server but this book pretends that there is. To sell you on this lie, the author spends more time making annoying jokes than actually documenting the subject. What a waste!!!"
2,Not bad for beginners!,"This book is good for beginers or reviewers, but it doesn't get deeply in the P&M stuff, that is the core of Site Server. Most of the book content is available in the product documentation."
1,rabbit007,the valve leaked an would not stop. it is now in my shed as I lost the paper-work an can't return itrabbit
3,"Half Perfection, Half Bubblegum","Because I love Tropical Brainstorm so much, I wanted more of Kirsty MacColl's music. Don't bother with this 2-disk album. Half of this album is most of Tropical Brainstorm, but not all of it. The other half is Kirsty's earliest music, which is bubblegum pop. Very disappointing. I would give the Tropical Brainstorm portion of this album 5 stars, and I would give the other stuff 1 star. That's how I came up with my overall 3-Star rating. But buy Tropical Brainstorm instead. And if you have and love Tropical Brainstorm and want more of Kirsty's flawless, sultry voice, buy something other than this Anthology."
4,Head Bopping Jam,G-Funk Era was back in full effect. Snoop Dogg came back late last year with the King of R&B R.Kelly on the Hook on this Joint. this was my cut. Snoop still in the laid back. R.Kelly who is the Baddest soul Brother on the Planet&the Brother could sing a Song about Candy on Toothbrush&Brushing your teeth backwards&the Song would still be soulful&On point. this was the cut.
2,Lector ten precaucion,"This is definitely not a casual plant book for children. It is an interesting book concerning various plants and how medicines can be made from them. It gives formulas and instructions on how to make a medicine from the plant. Many of the medicines are teas or vapors that are inhaled. The author states that he believes the information he has should be distributed, but totally leaves out where he obtained the information, if it is from old remedies or if he made them up. There is a lack of any information concerning who the author is. The pictures of the plants are crude and drawn in black and white. This keeps this book from being useful in making plant identifications. You need to be somewhat familiar with which plant they are talking about for each medicine. This book is totally lacking in any scientific data of any kind."
5,Great Read,"The Naked Marquis was a great read. I loved the storyline, as I've always been a sap for those storylines that involve old friends from childhood.I've never been very good at reviewing things so I'll just say that I loved the characters in the book and their relationship. The back and forth between the characters held a lot of witt and passion and had a lot of that great built up sexaul frustration from the battle going on between them. And as with all of the other Sally MacKenzie books I've read it had great, funny supporting characters as well. The combination of all the personalities and humor truly made the storyline come to life and made it believable. It's a great read and everyone should check it out!"
3,Okay for the beginner...,"I've studied many martial arts ever since I was 5 starting with tae kwwon do, then wing chun kung fu, then tai chi followed by jeet kune do and I train in all the arts. This book advertises that it can find the right martial arts for you. That is an incorrect statement as there is no PERFECT martial art for every type of person but rather a mixture of all the arts. Learning just one art that was recommended by a book and seeding its advice is not a good idea as you techniques and such will be limited to the art. However, this book gives good information about each specific art and gives you an idea of which is a good art to start learning. As Bruce Lee said, don't be confined by arts or system, but rather try to learn the techniques from two or three arts mentioned in the book."
5,The Complete Idiot's Guide to Martial Arts,"This is an excellent book and one that has been needed for some time. It is co-written by one of the world's top martial artists who, in addition to an excellent knowledge of shotokan karate, has journeyed across many karate and martial arts styles.The authors share their experience of various martial art styles in an excellent summary"
3,exactly what you'd expect,"This book is exactly what you'd expect it to be. A thorough yet easy to understand introduction to the world of martial arts. I have been studying tae kwon do for almost 2 years and I had a desire to step back and see where I and my school stand in the grand scheme of martial arts in general. This book helped me do that. I would recommend it for anyone wanting to find out more about martial arts before joining a particular school. You'll definetily know what your options are if you read this book.I give this book 3 stars because I don't believe in giving every book you like the highest score. The ""C"" grade should indeed be the average."
4,informative,"I picked up this book mostly as a curiousity into reading brief histories of other styles. I have a third degree black belt in Kenpo, but I was also interested in other styles.This is an excellent book for anyone beginning or thinking of training in the martial arts. I found their different rankings of what a student could expect to be informative, in regards to kicks/punches/grappling.I only wished there were more chapters in regards to other styles, but it's understandable since the styles they focused on were more likely to be found in North America.Definitely worth picking up for new or experienced martial arts practitioners"
1,this isn't what i paid for,this album has tracks named as though they are actually Eminem songs. i bought 'Please Stand Up' thinking i was getting that track but got talking instead. it's not possible to tell from the mp3 download interface that this is an 'unauthorized audio biography' by some annoying people calling themselves 'chrome dreams'.
1,King Kong vs Godzilla,"I got these movies for my husband, he likes them but they aren't done very well."
4,king kong escapes/king kong vs godzilla,It was off the hook. took me waaaaay back to when i was a child :)
5,There Really is a Mechi-Kong!,"When I was a kid and saw King Kong Escapes, I was mesmerized by the Mechi-Kong robot. What a great idea! He looks so cool! It had been so many years since I saw the film, I thought I had dreamt the movie. Imagine my suprise with this two-pack release! It is a pristine wide screen presentation. The film is as fun as I remembered it. Not to be taken too seriously, it is a rubber monster movie with cool ideas and plenty of monsters clashing, all within the trademark cheapo effects of the time. Utterly charming.The Toho version of Kong (his rubber suit, that is) is truly awful, but this only adds to the fun of the film. As this is a Japanese movie overdubbed in English, we also have the voice talents of Paul Frees (""Winter Warlock"" from the Rankin / Bass production of ""Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer"") providing the voice of the villian. What more could you ask for? How about the bonus of getting Godzilla vs. King Kong? You got it! What a bargain!"
5,For Toho fans only,"This assumes you're a Godzilla/Honda fan. The picture and sound quality are excellent! These movies really should be viewed in widescreen, vs the Goodtimes Video fullscreen version."
3,It's what you should expect...,This set of movies is exactly what you expect when you get it...it is a great value for two DVDs and my son is OBSESSED with any of the Godzilla or King Kong franchises so we were very pleased with the purchase.
3,King Kong Vs Godzilla/King Kong Escapes,"This was purchased for a seven year old who is going through a ""King Kong' phase. He has commented on the limited quality of the animation but is satisfied with the story lines."
2,FILM DEBUT OF GORASAURAS! BUT THATS IT FOLKS!,"1 STAR GOES TO THE FILM DEBUT OF THE CHARACTER GOROSAUROUS, ONE OF MY FAVORITES WHO NEVER FOUGHT GODZILLA AND SHOULD HAVE! AND 1 STAR FOR THE DECENT PRICE OF THIS SET. OTHERWISE KING KONG SUCKS AND SO DOES THE FACT THAT THE MAKERS OF KING KONG ESCAPES NAMED THE BAD GUY DOCTOR WHO! HOW DARE YOU! A ROCK THROUGH YOUR WINDOW SIR! UNFORTUNATELY KING KONG VS GODZILLA IS ALSO THE 2ND WORSE GODZILLA FILM OF ALL TIME. IT WAS THE WORST UNTILL GODZILLA VS MEGAGUIRUS, BUT THATS FOR A DIFFERENT REVIEW. I WOULD SUGGEST RENTING NOT BUYING THOUGH AS THE MAGNIFICANT GOROSARAUS IS ONLY IN A FEW MINUTES OF KING KONG ESCAPES."
3,widescreen but still cut and in english,"while this is a step up from what was previosly available ( a full screen king kong vs godzilla and no release of king kong escapes), it is still majorly lacking. it will be widescreen, but it will be in english and king kong vs godzilla will be the terribly mangled american version. so if you want a copy of these films with hopefully decent video quality than i recomend it but if you want the real thing steer clear."
4,Homages In Movie,"While disappointed this wasn't a sequal to King Kong vs. Godzilla (either a reboot or retcon, for Toho's Kong), I was pleased as a Kong fan. It pays homages to original Kong movie.When Kong fights Gorosaur and the Water Snake, he kills both like to T-Rex and Serpent, in Cooper's original. Also, the character of Dr. Who, pays homage to William Hartnell's (BBC) Doctor Who. When he first appears, he wears an outfit and hat, Hartnell wore in the first Doctor Who story (An Unearthly Child). While not the best Kong movie ever, it will please general Kong fans."
5,Monkey Maddness.............,"Seen both films when I was a kid, teen. and, adult. I have to say many thanks for Peter Jackson remake is why both films got release. I hear people complaints about no extras, or no japanese version. I say who cares. I'm just glad the movies got release in widesceen with decent picture quality. Another thing you can't beat the price for both films. In life take what you can get, and be happy."
2,Worthless Junk.....,"No Extras, no commentary,no Japanese version (like the awesome Sony/Tristar series), no inlay card, not even a trailer. I mean come on, they dropped the ball here, bigtime. Love, love, love the movie, hate the presentation. Media-blasters is doing a great job with their Toho releases, theirs is a company with a finger on the pulse of the Japanese Giant Monster fanbase.This on the other hand, is worthless junk. I mean this is only one of the minor classics, right? It's a shame I'll buy it just to have in my collection. At least King Kong Escapes has a great score by Akira Ifukube. Not even the freekin trailer for cryin' out loud....."
3,"Soft, but fray in the wash","These are very soft blankets and are a nice size. The only bad thing about them is the corners frayed in the wash from the very firs time I washed them! These are nice, but there are better one's out there that hold up better...I like Carter's better (especially their stretchy micro fiber fleece)."
1,Terrible quality,"I received these as a gift and after I washed them for the first time, they pilled and there was lint all over the laundry! Now they look like I have had them for years. These are not that soft, either. I am very disappointed. I have some waverly waffle blankets that I like a lot better. Or, better yet, get the Carters 30x40 blankets. Save your money!"
5,Many uses for a recieving blanket,"I couldn't have lived without these blankets. I used them for swaddling, and the fact that there are four to a pack is great. I don't have to wash them so often with four of them. They are small and fit great into a diaper bag and are very absorbant. The puppies on them are pretty cute too.I use them for a lot of things. When a diaper leaks in the middle of the night, and its too late to change the sheets because the baby just wants to go back to sleep. I fold one twice and lay it over the wet spot until I can change the sheets in the morning when the baby is awake. That has been a life saver."
4,Great Blankets,"I agree, these blankets are perfect for breastfeeding cover-ups. Also, they aren't too heavy so if you need just a light blanket over baby they work well."
5,Great receiving blankets.,These blankets are very soft and wash well. No shrinking. They are thinner than the Carters receiving blankets but they are still great. They are lighter weight so it's nice to cover baby's car seat with them when you don't want people touching him or her. They are great in the summer when you just need something light in the air conditioning.
2,Laborious Reading,"I have owned this book for 4 months now and literally cannot seem to get through it. I even put it aside to read another book about Princess Diana in its entirety, which was fascinating. Now that I'm back to this one, I've decided to skim through and locate the interesting parts until I'm finished with it. Patrick Jephson takes forever to make a point... the book is somewhat well-written, however, which may be its only positive point. I don't like smut or tawdriness, especially about someone who contributed so much to the world as Princess Di did, but sadly that seems to be all Jephson knows how to recount. I own practically all the titles written about Diana, but when this one joins them on the shelf, unlike the others, it won't be taken out again and re-read. I'm glad it was deeply discounted when I bought it!"
1,Avoid it,"This is the worst book about Diana I have ever read, and I have read most of them. This book should really be called ""The Patrick Jephson Story"" because the author, Diana's ex secretary, talks about himself so much.To be avoided at all costs..."
3,Well writen Book,"Mr. Jephson writes with a sensitivity and discreetness about the Princess, a complicated lady living a troubled life. I found the book enlightening about lives ( the Royals) that most of us know little about. The book was amusing in places, boring in other places, but the style of writing and mastery of the English language is superb. I felt Mr. Jephson was being honest and fair in regards to all of the royal family. However, I'm not sure what his purpose was in writing the book."
2,What exatly was Jephson's role to Diana?,"This has got to be the hardest book to read on the Princess. Jephson comes across like a short man working for a tall woman. I'm not sure what his role in Diana's life was, but he certainly did not help. His book is full of put downs and I'm left with the general impression that he did not like her. How is it that he could be the executor of her will? Possibly an oversight on Diana's part. I can't help but agree with her sons that this books only intention is to exploit her. Don't bother reading it if you truly care for her. It is a very sad story."
1,Worst book I have read!,"This is the worst book I have ever read. I am surprised it was published. So poorly written and so hard to follow, it is just plain boring and really does not even say anything. For all the words in the book, ultimately, it does not say a thing! A waste of time!"
1,This book is about the authors life .,"This book is very well written however, it is about the authors life.... as an assistant to Princess Diana. There are little tid bits of info about Diana consistantly through the book, but I found no real window into the life of Diana. Nevertheless, if your interested in the daily life of a royal secretary well than you won't be disappointed. The book is not a total disappiontment, but I would wait till it hits the paperback."
1,This book stunk,"This book was simply terrible. The writing is poor; the flow terrible. No one in the book is sympathetic -- not the Princess, not any of the staff, and certainly not the author. Much has been written, good and bad, about the Princess. I bought this book because I'd hoped to hear an unbiased view. Jephson has almost nothing nice to say about her. I hate books where I wish they would end soon; I felt that way throughout this book. I forced myself to finish reading it because I'd hoped to find something worthwhile. Save your money."
1,Hire an editor!,"This book is nearly 500 pages, but barely half of that is informative and even less is actually interesting. I've read nearly every book about the Princess, this is one of the few I couldn't finish. I was interested in a portrait of Diana the woman rather than Diana the icon. I also read this book to get some insight about the inner workings of royalty and the ""palace machine"". Any hopes of this were lost in Jephson's endless rambling.He criticizes Diana from head to toe, most of which seem ridiculous and petty. I have no doubt the Princess was a demanding and difficult boss, but Jephson makes her seem more like a soap opera villian than a normal, flawed human being. Before the first chapter is over, you'll be wondering why this man stayed with Diana for so many years. His bitterness overshadows what could have been and interesting ""insiders"" perspective of the Princess. AVOID IT!!!!"
1,shadows of a private secretary,"Except for money, what is the point in writing a book several years after someone's death detailing each and every one of their faults. The book is a complete loss since it only tells the reader one side of Diana's personality and that, as he writes, is completely horrible. The writer is so busy telling us why he disliked her, he completely loses his direction and is hard to follow. Don't spend your money on this one."
2,Pompous Psychobabble,"The author, Princess Diana's secretary, was a pompous twit, who fancies himself to be a psychiatrist. Every good deed the princess did was analyzed to death by this ""loyal"" secretary. I newly discovered the meaning of boredom while reading this book. It was more like a logistial log of prepation for trips. I kept wondering, while suffering through what should have been titled, ""Jephson's Revenge"", if he ever knew her at all, or if he ever even had a personal coversation with her. I'm just glad I bought this for under $2."
1,Another leech making money off the Princess,"If you want to hear about how Patrick Jephson earned a living, carrying baggage, running errands, making sure the flower girl is standing at the right spot, etc, etc then you should buy this book. The book has Diana's picture on the cover, but it is not about her, it is more about Jephson himself. The minute the Queen sends a letter asking the Wales' to consider divorce seriously, the errand boy decides to jump ship. And now this book. Diana's lady-in waiting, Anne Beck-Smith did not serve her employer well by hiring this man. This nervous, starstruck chap should not have been given the privilege of serving Diana.I guess not everyone can be a Paul Burrell. Diana's former butler is a man of integrity, character, and professsionalism."
1,Fabtech Leaf SPRING,"Very upset over this order as I think the product description is uninformative. It says fabtech leaf springs (plural) so I was under the idea I was getting a pair of springs, and it came today and only one, what the heck am I going to do with one spring???!! Not cool AMAZON!!!!!Fabtech FTS44005 3.5"" Performance System Front Leaf Springs"
2,Nudity Also Optional,"As a fan of naturist and clothing-free lifestyles, this film held mild appeal for me due to the semi-attractive Mom's sudden interest in going around the house naked. Sadly, there is very little of this and somewhat of a ludicrous plot. I only watched for the nudity, but even that was more for comedy than for actual clothing-optional views or lifestyle. One good thing about this, in fact, was that the filmmakers were unafraid to include full-frontal and semi-nudity in the women, but not in the men.I also found the film a bit too frank with its sex talk. Thank god I only paid $2.99 for a one-time On Demand download. It's just not worth any real money.Long story short: If you want to see what averages out to be around 10 minutes or so of actual clothing-optionality and MILF, I would encourage renting this rather than making a purchase."
1,"Fractured Plot, Horrible Acting, Amateur Script","I have seen kindergarten school plays that were better scripted, had better dialog and interaction, with more professional actors and settings. Buying/renting this movie is a total waste of your money and your time. If this movie were a vehicle accident, it would be a 22-car pile-up."
3,Today show Recommendation,"I purchased this item based on a recommendation from a Today Show segment on BBQing, it was touted as the best grill brush they had ever used. I bought 2 and they are average at best compared to less expensive brushes."
2,Doesn't do much,"Not all that effective. The 3 parallel scrubbers are handy, but they bend pretty easily."
3,ford 2600 shop manual,there should be about 250 pages in this book.i was disappointed to discover only 99 pages.electrical system diesel fuel system cooling system hydraulic lift system pto system transmission system pages not in this manual.
2,Don't bother,"The index in this manual lists pages to 258...unfortunatly it contains only 99 pages. Naturally, the subjects I was interested in are in the missing pages. It does have a wiring diagram but only for the gas model."
4,Review of Manual,"I have used the manual already to help me determine a part (o-ring) that was failed and causing a hydraulic leak. Good Manual overall, but could have some more basic knowlege for those that aren't mechanics."
5,Read it too late,"His writing is enjoyable to read and the content is very thought provoking. He values the committed relationship and never over-simplifies the many facets at work when a relationship is at a crossroads. There is helpful information about the role of depression when relationships lose their energy. I recommend this book to all people in a relationship whether the relationship is in trouble or not. I don't know if it's just my vantage point, but had I read this book before my relationship ended, we might have had a better chance of salvaging it."
5,This book played a key role in saving my marriage.,"One chapter of this book could have been written about my husband, whose mild but chronic depression had led him to feel unhappy with our marriage and to become entangled with a younger, wilder woman (referred to as ""Carmencita"" in the book). He had moved out of our home when I found this chapter and finally persuaded him to read it. Miraculously, he recognized himself in the story, began to understand what had happened, gained the courage to begin prozac and psychotherapy, and found hope that our marriage might be salvageable (the chapter helped give me hope as well). Just as the chapter predicted, he discovered joy in his life and in our marriage, and has re-gained the character that his depression had smothered. Thank you, Dr. Kramer. Your insight was uncanny and invaluable."
4,Very intelligent and empowering,"There are far too many ""Cosmo"" type books thatpromise to give the reader the definitive answer which I believe holdsout a false hope of curing the problem if only one answers a quiz correctly or follows the author's prescriptive advice on the best way to cure the problem. Dr. Kramer has both the humility to recognize he holds no particular magic answer that applies to all people's situations and demonstrates a belief in the reader's intelligence to make their own choices based on the material he presents in the book. I appreciated the book greatly for its presentation of all the complexities involved with such a decision and for its assumption that I had the ability to use the material in the way best suited to my situation."
4,Thought-provoking,"The reader below from Austin TX notes that Kaplan chooses to counsel childless couples on the ""should you leave"" question, and considers that a copout. But the author makes clear that he feels that once children are a part of the picture a relationship has an overwhelming reason to continue in spite of the sort of relationship troubles he discusses in this book. He is successful at evaluating reasons to leave or stay when children are not part of the relationship, and if they were I'm sure most readers would agree that these relationship problems would be worth working on."
5,A masterpiece of truth and insight,"If you are of a couple, whatever your situation, this book is a tour-de-force of elegantly insightful writing that will open your heart and mind. Dr Kramer's advice is of a subtle intelligence that will surprise and delight the close reader. Embrace this book and live with it for a few weeks. You will be rewarded."
2,90 pages too long,"Meg Stanton-Lynch is an American granddaughter of a Duke. Justin St. James is a deadly handsome Earl with a ward named Emily and he had been banished from England for 6 years as everyone thought he killed his cousin's fiance. Well, of course he didn't and of course Meg knows this and wants to help Justin clear his name. But here is the vastly annoying part of the book - even after sleeping with Justin, she won't marry him. Her denying his proposal was about a 100 pages and it was about 90 pages too long. She loved him! She knew he liked her, appreciated her, needed her. So he did out outright say he loved her, well, it was unrealistic that she would continue to say no even after it was apparent that her refusal caused a rift in his relationship with Pen and her husband. She was childish and frankly uninteresting. Also, everytime she did something a tad out of the common way for an English gal, it was always, well, I'm an American!"
3,"Eh, a little disappointed in the heroine","""The Devil Earl"" is back in town and wants to clear up his name. Meg is an American cousin of Justin's neighbors. She doesn't know about his dark past and is rather intrigued by him. At first I really loved the character of Meg, she wasn't being completely silly the way American characters are often portrayed in historical fiction. She was bold without being abrasive and smart without being a genius. Then she went on her quest for self. She declared herself unwilling to marry because she needed to find a good hobby first.This is after getting dirty with the Earl.Yeah.I lost some respect for the character there.Its not bad and it is fine for a rainy day, but I just didn't fall in love with the characters."
4,No more dome bruises,works as advertised. fit well and protects the top of my head. no complaints here.
2,Good Protection but hurts.,"Pros:Full head protection, hugs the back of you head and feels secure.Cons:Cheap foam, digs into your cheek bones, fogs ridiculously easy.I have a big head, the [styro]foam was digging into my cheekbones and was scrunching up my face, after about 15 minutes wearing it, it gave me a headache. Also I saw it on walmart shelves never trusted any paintball stuff from there and this only makes it worse."
3,A good beginner mask,"This is a good beginner mask, cheap and inexpensive. It has a habit of fogging no matter what you do. the foam around the goggles hardens quickly. I had to replace mine with softer cushion, foam. the head shield I couldn't use because its made for people with small heads."
3,Great Protection. Need upgrades on vision.,"This mask is great when you play twice a year. Good beginner mask. Gives you a 360 degree head protection except at the base of the neck. The mask is covered with holes to give you adequate air circulation. I live in Florida and I play in the middle of summer but the mask kept my head cool during games. The major problem that I found in this mask is the lens. It cannot stand high humidity fogging. Good luck playing in the rain, once this mask fogs it will be fogged up all day. Make sure you bring some anti fog spray to help out. The foam that goes around the lens deteriorated after a year of use and started digging in my face giving me scratch marks and if your bald, it will scratch the top of your head since there is no padding in place. The lens is interchangeable but its hard to get out. My suggestion is get the the JT Carnivore as it addressed the problems of this model."
4,Good for airsoft wars,"Helmet works well for airsoft wars, but it's a little tight. Having the helmet tight makes the goggles press into cheekbones more. Good product for the money and the company shipped right away."
4,JT Headshield Single Mask,I just received the helmet. Overall I would say this is a great helmet. I can't wait to test this out.My only complaint is that the foam digs into the skin when you put on the mask.This is also a two piece mask where the top part can be removed. You can turn this into a single mask if you want.
5,My son and me!,"I believe this product is 100% safe for me and my son. i purchased this helmet/mask/goggies for my son he,s 13"" i will not put any unsafe, paintball product on him. The JT Elite HeadShield, i love it and so do my son in i will get one more for me. now i will not get hit in the back of my head anymore. This product rate,s best in comparison to other paintball mask for one the safety of the head 100% so i like this product best overall. So anyone who dislike this product must like geting hit in the back of his head."
3,Pretty good but fogs up,"This mask gives you whole head protection which is necessary when playing with large groups. Getting shot in the back of your head by friendly fire sucks. The foam inside was kind of itchy and seems cheap. Major problem was fogging. I fogged up every game and basically had to forfeit or wait out the game. I read that dish soap helps fogging, it only worked for one match. Tried breathing through just my nose. It helped a little, but i still fogged up. If you can find a way to stop this from fogging, it could be a great mask."
4,Reviewing a different product,"I have not purchased this set yet but will probably do so. As I am reading the reviews, I see that there are some reviews that are not actually for this product. Why would you rate a different product than what the item is? That is very misleading for those of us who are doing research. Just because you have had a bad experience/purchase from a manufacturer doesn't mean that all of their products are bad."
3,Warranty is bunk!,"I purchased Henckels Twin Cast cookware with a lifetime warranty. The non-stick surface started coming off, despite careful use with only plastic utensils. I sent in the cookware for replacement and Henckels responded that the cookware was inspected and not found to be defective. I disagree. Do not buy this cookware unless your feel the price is worth about five years of use. At the prices that they sell their cookware for, the cookware should last a lifetime."
5,A Good Read...,"Absolutely worth-reading........... I am majoring in M/E History ;and I certainly recommend this book. I have read it twice and still refer to its objective content for my college papers.The information is weel-written, straight forward, and selected without political or religious side-taking.I hope I will read more from this author."
5,Pleasantly informative,I am impressed by the wholesome content of this timely book.We need to study the roots & causes of our troubled relationship with this or any other stratigic nation in the Middle-East.The author rightfully reflects on the lack of consideration for Human Rights in the political system in Persia.
2,"Fascinating Iran, poor English",Too bad for the reader as Mr. Shirazi has obviously not deemed it necessary to write his book in proper English. Is this the translator's fault? Not one paragraph goes by without grammatical mistakes or words so improperly chosen that it makes it nearly impossible to understand what he is trying to say. It's a pity such an ancient civilization should fall victim to such a disservice.
5,Splendid!!!,"Thanks to the author, I gave a detailed look at the history of Iran. I cannot read Persian, so this book is very handy."
5,"""Wear a groove through the disc"" good!","This album is everything that country USED to be. Before Tim and Faith started whimpering about their kids and turning 30, before Shania grew boobs, and Alabama covered the freakin' Backdoor Boys for cryin' out loud, there was good redneck beer drinkin' country music. This lost art is captured in 17 Greatest Hits, like Jack Daniels If You Please, You Never Even Called Me By My Name (my wife and I played this at our wedding!), Would You Lay With Me, Longhaired Redneck, Mona Lisa, and the rest..... If you want to call yourself a country music fan, then you better have this disc in your truck to back up those words. (Better make that American truck, just to be safe.... there's a bunch of wannabees driving Toyotas out there!) There's a couple here I skip, but mostly because they are ballads and kill the buzz. Johnny Paycheck does Take This Job and Shove It better, but this version is pretty good, too. Great disc, put it in the cart NOW!"
1,Not Really Greatest Hits,"This is all of his ""clean"" songs - and if you know him, you know that he is not known for his clean songs."
4,David Allan Coe 17 Greated Hits,I just happen to be a big fan of David. He has a few tunes you can feel and I have most all of his records.
3,You Didn't Even Call Me By My Name,"I've been a customer for 10 years, and you didn't even call me by my name."
3,Racist,"If I had read all the reviews of this CD before purchasing it, I would have realized that there are some racial lyrics that I am not comfortable with. I do like some of the songs on the CD, but I cringe when I hear the ""N"" word, and certainly can't play this in mixed company."
1,VERY RACIST,"Man, I cannot believe it. He is so racist, it's worse than enimem. I mean, what does he have against african americans. He sings so much about beer and KKK, that it's appalling."
4,"Stylish design, decent sound","The members of my big family between them own three other Sony boomboxes, and this recent addition was bought purely for the style (and after my very disappointing experience with the Sharper Image Beetle CD Boombox; see my review there for details). The Psyc looks real funky... and Japanese. It reminds me variously of the head of a Power Ranger and the body of this nameless cat in another Japanese anime. Like other Sony boomboxes, it's intuitive to use. The LCD is bigger and more informative than the old models we own. The sound quality is adequate for a small boombox, which is to say you get stereo sound and some fake bass. :) We plan to take this with us when we go picnicking, and outdoors as long as the boombox is loud enough, sound quality is not too important.Our oldest Sony CD boombox has been in service for 13 years... I hope this one lasts just as long."
2,Rather disappointing.,"I am disappointed with the sound and the usability of the product. The mega bass and richness of sound from this product is less than satisfying. The display is very limited. When using the presets, you don't know what station your on for several seconds, so you have to memorize them or write them down. Manually tuning a station is rather painful also.Overall I would make sure you spend some time with this unit before buying it."
5,Great CD player,"I received this CD player as a birthday present and started using it immediately. So far, I have not been disappointed by it. The sound quality is excellent, although I've never been much of an audiophile. I haven't had any problems playing CDs, whether they were bought CDs or CDs that I burned myself. The volume levels are good and there's a good range of volume. Some people complain that certain CD players don't play loud enough, but the volume level on this CD player goes quite high, so if you like your music loud, you can hear it loud. The radio function is great, with good reception. I especially like the jogdial, which allows you to move from track to track on CDs or from radio station to radio station with ease, and the remote control is an added bonus, although I don't use it that often. Over all, a great product with a reasonable price tag."
1,Worst purchase I ever made,"I bought this boombox in September 2002, I loved the style, and it worked great for my needs. Until one day in April 2003 when it just stopped working completely. It doesn't turn on anymore..I've tried everything, completely new batteries, plugging into the wall...nothing works. Big disappointment, especially from Sony, a company I always expect to produce quality products."
1,Broke within a year,"Even after normal use, this disc player was useless in less than a year. It just would not turn on one day."
2,Mediocre product,"Worked just fine when I got it, but right after the warranty expired, the CD player just stopped working. I didn't do anything to it, but now it won't read CD's. Also had problems with it not playing unless plugged into wall, even with backup batteries. I guess you get what you pay for :("
5,Great Inroduction Disc to Great and Original Prog Band,"I am a complete VDGG fanatic and I would use this disc as an intro to those who are seeking to hear what one of the greatest bands of the progressive rock era sound like. And for the other VDGG nuts out there, this (as far as I know) is the only CD release that contains the b-side ""Boats of millions of years."" It wasn't included on the otherwise superb 4-cd box set."
5,GREAT NEW SOUND,"This such an AWESOME CD! Every track is an absolute keeper that would top the charts as a single. Usually you have to wait for a ""Greatest Hits"" to get this good a set of tunes on one CD. Extraordinarily good vocals perfectly matched seamlessly with really hip and imaginative instrumentalizations. AN ABSOLUTE WINNER, a MUST for anyone's collection."
5,A very polished hidden gem,"I wasn't expecting what I heard on this CD. Let's just say I was pleasantly surprised. Usually I find some great music from the `hidden gem' artists, but not as polished and lavishly recorded as Outerstar. I can't get enough of Nathaniel Schellin's voice... very passionate. This is one I would highly recommend even to the pickiest of my friends."
4,i'd recommend this one,"i first heard about Outerstar when a friend of mine sent ""You Love it When it Rains"" to me. i really liked it, and decided to check out the whole CD. i'm glad i did, because it's all really catchy stuff."
3,Get off your knees now,"I am a little hard on this release from BOC because it leaves a lot to be desired. If you want to get a real sense of BOC in concert, do yourself a favor, pass this one by and BUY On Your Feet or On Your Knees, THAT is BOC Live, Raw, and Unleashed in hour plus frenzy of spine tingling greatness. This is obviously a commercial affair that shows BOC in less than great form. It is just OK. Nice cover though."
4,this is a good cd,"the good BOC songs are on this CD. i have the cassete at home and i like the songs on this cd. i would rate it a 5, but it is live and the people cheer in the middle of one song."
3,Brings Back High School Memories,"BOC was eleventh grade for me. I hooked up with my first band and we played these guys, Black Sabbath, and Rush to death. The live version of ""Astronomy"" really did it for me. In retrospect though this isn't Cult's best live album. For one it's so short, and it was only made after they had done just two more studio albums since the double live On Your Feet Or On Your Knees (their best live album). It does have other high moments; ""ETI"" smokes, we get the only Cult live versions of ""We Gotta Get Outta This Place"" and ""Kick Out The Jams""(but give me the MC5's original any day over this one). ""Don't Fear The Reaper"" sounds weak in the vocal department here.""RU Ready To Rock"" was a silly throwaway from their worst record up to this point, so why include it here? I get the feeling that this was probably a contract filler album while they were in a little bit of a transition;manager/producer/ guru Sandy Pearlman got the axe before they went in the studio to record Mirrors."
2,Not my favorite BOC live album,"Aside from the strong performance of ""Astronomy"", this is a much weaker live album than BOC's earlier ""On Your Feet Or On Your Knees""."
2,Disappointing,"The title says it all. I bought this album on vinyl when it first came out, based solely on having everything else BOC had done. It is BY FAR my least played BOC disc over the past 20+ years. Other than Astronomy, there's little here of interest, and the live version doesn't add much, if anything, to the stellar version from Secret Treaties. The cover of ""Kick Out The Jams"" isn't bad, but why bother. Stick to the studio versions, if you need a Live BOC fix, ""On You Feet...."" is much better."
2,I agree with John's review.,"Well, I haven't heard the entire album which maybe a little unfair to write a review of the album, but I did download (Don't Fear) The Reaper and from what I heard of this rather weak version I wouldn't exactly rush out to buy the CD."
5,EBM music,"The moment that the music come blaring out of my speakers, is the moment I fell in love. Their music takes you to a place deep in your mind, heart, and soul. Take my advice and buy this CD."
4,Bethel + Jameel?,"I like Bethel, and I think she was fine without a boyfriend. It seems like writers today want to pair everyone up! But I do like Jameel, and I think Bethel could have been nicer to him. He did bug her a lot but she was pretty rude when he was super nice to her all the time. I was glad in the end she decided to dance with him at the Beach Blowout. (btw, I know in #18 they are b/f and g/f) Damon and Jessica also have some little misunderstandings- Damon thinks something is wrong with Jessica because she's so out of it all the time (she's just very tired- read the book to find out why) and Jessica thinks that Damon doesn't like her anymore because he hasn't asked her to the blowout. But things work out in the end! This book wasn't my favorite, but it was still okay."
2,What was Bethel thinking?,"Bethel falls for a seventh grader! This book is totally unrealistic. No 8th grader in their right mind would ever fall 4, let alone date a 7th grader!"
4,"So, So","This was my second CSC3000. The newest version is less desirable than my original one bought 2-3 yrs. ago. The chuck body seems more open and collects dust quickly. I finish a lot of stuff on the lathe. It works OK and the jaw set is fine for 10"" and smaller dia. The chuck has trouble holding larger or very unbalanced loads. All in all it's OK for the money but not as good as the Oneway. I bought this from Amazon for about $10 less than it sells from PSI direct and got free shipping. DUH!! PSI, anybody home?"
4,Wood Turners delight...,"When it arrived, I couldn't wait to use it!!It was fantastic, and a great addition/help to my wood turning shop."
3,Good and Bad,Overall I am happy with the chuck. It holds bowls well and is pretty easy to use. Unfortunately the screw chuck broke on its second use which is disappointing. The instructions could be better--you have to use intuitive trial and error too much. I would recommend this chuck for beginners (like me) because of its cost. Don't trust the screw chuck if you buy it.
5,A wood chuck to lust for,"I received the Barracuda chuck promptly in excellent condition, all parts accounted for. Installation was simple and the directions straightforward. I have used this item for several different operations and have been duly impressed with its performance."
5,Wonderful Tool,"Received my barracuda 2 Chuck and it's GREAT!! Does'nt have a back pate but that has nothing to do with it's performance,It works like it's supposed to.GREAT Product at a GREAT Price.Don't know how Amozon can do it But their prices Beat a lot of sellers.Have been a loyal Amazon Costomer and look forward to my next Purchase,as for this Chuck For the Price it can't be BEAT!! You can spend much more and get much LESS,so go ahead and order one of these(CSC3000C)and you won't be Dissapointed!!With all the extrasJaws you get in the kit plus the Case to keep it in it's too good to pass up this bargan,I love Mine and plan on using it a lot....Happy Turning....until we meet again....Rykaman....My rating is a definite (5) STARS!!!!!"
3,Chuck Key Slips,"It's ok for the money but not great. The chuck key slips off the teeth in the chuck when you try to tighten the jaws. You need to be exactly on them and apply downward pressure as you tighten. It holds ok but seems to loosen up and the wood flys out occasionally. Old adage, you get what you pay for. If I were to buy another one,it would be a Oneway."
5,"Excellent product, exp for the money","I'd previously bought Nova chuck anticipating that it would be a premium product and I didn't want stuff flying off the lathe at high speed. If was limited in functionality, constantly needed more add-on's. Finally I got frustrated with add-ons and decided I needed another chuck. So I bought this.What a surprise!A - its a entire kit - not just one piece.B - the cost of the kit is less than just a chuckC - while its not quite the same fit and finish, its very close.D - the adjustment levers actually have handles on them, not just bars - nicer.So over to functionality.This chuck has better little teeth to grip the work and I haven't had one bowl fly off, even the large ones (where I have with the other one). Adjustments are the same and I've been able to reef on it very hard.Functionally its better and more usable than the Nova and I really appreciate having all the additional components.Overall, VERY well worth the money."
5,There's probably no better value,"This chuck is outstanding. It is designed and built very well. It looks great, comes with several sets of jaws for added versatility, runs true and performs as promised. I've looked at chucks from a wide range of competitors and can't imagine my having made a better choice for any reason. What more could one ask? I also purchased the companion jumbo flat jaws with which I'm equally pleased. No faults with either product."
2,buy a better one,Nice unit if you don't plan to use it very long. I wore mine out in 2 years .The gears are cheap.
4,Great build quality,"I was very pleased with the quality of this chuck, having never used one before. I'm new to wood turning but have been a woodworking hobbyist - a serious one- for about 40 years.Still, it would have been great if PSI had included instructions with this set.. It is mostly self-evident, but it would be a help to a newbie to have even a sheet of paper with a few tips on it.I would still recommend this as an excellent, low cost alternative to some of the other offerings out there.."
3,Not bad for the price,"The only problem I have had, and the other guys in our shop, is that the jaws will loosen after a little time. You must stop during your turning to check this ever so often. Most of us that have this chuck have had a machinist drill and tap a hole that can be used to ""hold"" the jaws in place. This stops the jaws from loosening during a turning and losing your project to the floor."
5,Great Chuck Set,I am very satisfied with this Chuck set. I have used it in many applications and it has splendidly accomplished all my turning tasks with flying colors.
4,PSI 4 Jaw Chuck,"So far I really like this chuck. It grips well, comes with a pretty good set of other jaws, and is well built. The only negative I have is that the packaging wasn't great and so when I opened the box the case that everything comes in was broken into pieces. This is not a huge deal though, so I can say that I am very happy with the chuck."
4,Good system for the woodturner.,"Recently purchased this PSI chuck. Just getting started into woodturning but knew enough from other people getting a chuck like this would be very handy. And it is! The jaw system is very strong and holds the pieces of wood well. Also comes with plenty of various jaws that make it ideal for many different types of projects. The one problem I had was the screw that comes with this chuck is fairly small and broke on me, but I was turning a bowl that may have been a bit big for the system, so it was not a manufacture defect. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a good chuck for a decent price."
4,War between the States fiction............,...about a largely ignored area of the conflict - rural Arkansas. If the genre appeals read this one.Well done with half a dozen characters that will stick with you after you finish the book.Addresses situations about that war's family level impact that I'd never considered.Several wrongs are righted but the book leaves some open ended situations to suggest a follow on maybe?
3,Great for target practice!,"This game is good for target practice. It is pretty fun, and the graphics are pretty good. Unfortunately for Xbox, there are only a couple of shooting games to choose from."
3,House of Dead 3 w/Light Gun for xbox 360,"Pros: House of Dead 2 includedCons: Light gun plug does not fit in xbox 360 port (note: vendor substituted Predator Light gun compatible w/xbox, BUT NOT XBOX 360)Stats: 7 yr old son finished game <5 days w/wireless controllerwishes: I really need an adaptor for the light gun or a gun con that is made for the xbox 360 as I'll never be able to aim/shoot w/o a light gun"
3,Boring to toddlers,"My toddler loves Baby Einstein DVD's, but I have to agree with many of the other reviewers. Where are the puppets? And why are the kids in the DVD not actually playing the instruments?My toddler finds this DVD very boring. The DVD is simply animated animals coming onstage with an instrument and then it cuts to clips of children with the instrument (but these kids aren't actually playing the instruments). There are hardly any puppets and the colors are not very visually stimulating.I appreciate the thought of introducing the children to instruments but there are more creative ways to do so (and more accurate ways as well)."
3,Where's the music?,"I agree with the nay-sayers on this video. This is by far the least interesting (to my toddler) of the 10 or so Baby Einstein videos we own. She just walks away when I turn this video on. Her normal response is to get up and dance to the music. But this video takes so much time playing a precious few notes on a single instrument, that there are few whole songs played anywhere!"
2,Disappointing!,"I had high hopes for what Disney could produce with Meet the Orchestra because we all know that when it comes to music, you can't start too young. The educational value of this DVD was limited and I would characterize it mostly as entertainment. It introduced the sight and sound (albeit synthesized) of the orchestral instruments. That's nice, but it is nothing a baby wouldn't have to watch more than a few times to learn.For baby's musical development, my favorite baby DVD was Trebellina, which teaches notes pitch and tackles a number of instruments, instroducing them individually as well as together. There is a lot there to challenge baby (and my kids found it pretty darn entertaining as well). Brainy Baby isn't bad either."
2,Pretty Boring Video,"This one is just not up to Baby Einstein's quality. It is dull and not really entertaining to toddlers. It's really just a laundry list of instruments, without anything fun and whimsical in between. I was very disappointed."
4,Large Tuba With A Baby,It's so funny because the tuba is so big! And it's little ears and big discoveries! i like to watch it five times a week it is so good.
3,"Bought movie today, 4 days early....","First off, my local grocery store obviously accidentally put this out early because I bought it today, 4 days before the release date. So I bought it for my 1 yr old girl who loves, loves baby einstein.My review of it was it was ok. I was pretty excited about it coming out thinking it was going to be great but like I said it was just ok. I feel like it lacked visual colors that stimulate babies and toddlers. It also didn't have alot of the cutesy things in the dvd that I always wonder where they get this stuff( like toys playing instruments, ect). It mainly used alot of teenagers playing instruments, showing bands playing, and it used the puppets alot more that some of the other dvds. I do think that a toddler watching this would definetly understand that music is something you can make and do, If it keeps their attention long enough.I liked the recent 'on the go' dvd alot more and so did my baby."
1,Don't waste your money!,"What a missed opportunity! What could have been a great chance to introduce babies/toddlers to music was missed. Instead, instruments are introduced using some fake electronic violin, cello and other instrument ""sounds."" Also, as someone else noted there was an ommision of the oboe, which is a very integral part of the woodwind section. When the piano is introduced there is a jazzy version of ""Fur Elise"" which is an easy choice, but the video misses out on a wealth of piano music. Then piano and guitar play ""Fur Elise"" AGAIN Flaminco/world music style. When the orchestra is finally introduced they play a hockey version of Beethoven's 9th with the ""canned"" instruments. You could just picture some guy at Radio Shack playing it on some Casio electric piano. Please do yourself a favor and take your child to a real concert or better yet wait for something on television with real musicians playing real music!"
2,High Expectations,"My almost-three year old was not taken by this DVD. He lost interest quickly compared to ""on the go"". I am very into musical instruments and had high hopes, as I would like my children to at least know about music, if not love it. I hated that the young players did not match the music (fingerings were all wrong). I thought bugle and recorder were strange instruments to portray. Basically disappointed with this one in comparison to the other DVDs. We won't toss it, but I don't see my son choosing it in his regular rotation of Thomas, Elmo and other Baby Einstein DVDs."
5,A BIG HIT!,"I purchased this DVD for my son who is a huge fan of Baby Einstein and music. I found it to be the perfect combination, although there are not too many puppets I found it very educational especially for music lovers. But there were a few instruments missing but to be honest I dont think most 2 year olds would notice!Nannette"
3,Not as good as others...,"I bought this DVD to give my 17 month old some more of the ""older"" baby einstein dvd's. Compared to some of the newer ones, this one is not my favorite. I was a music minor in college and was thrilled with the idea of the instruments. Unfortunately, my son did not really like this DVD. The puppet shows were very short and not very entertaining."
4,Baby Einsteins Meet the Orchestra,"Meet the Orchestra made by Baby Einstein is good. It took the children a little while to get into it; ages 4 and 1 1/2...who love Baby Noah and get really excited to watch that. It tends toward not as 'child-friendly' as some of the other productions. I've also have seen better years ago that my children watched but can't seem to find it, so this one is not on the top of the list for Baby Einstein productions."
2,Not worth the money,I bought this for my 15month old who loves all of his other Baby Einstein DVD's & this lacks the ability to keep his attention. I feel that this was missed opportunity to really introduce toddlers to music! It lacks the visual colorful stimiluation that many of the other DVD's did so well. All in all I am disappointed in the presentation & content.
1,Appalling product,"I received this video as a gift and started to play it for my 20 month old daughter. I was appalled that a Baby Einstein/Disney production would use synthesizer sounds to introduce acoustic instruments of the orchestra! Let's hope they never create a video on anatomy- they would probably use robots! Even the first segment on the trombone uses the wrong synth patch- that of a ""tuba!""If you want something for your children, there are any number of better materials available- Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra, Fantasia, and Leonard Bernstein's sessions.By the way, my qualifications: professional trumpet player in NYC, bachelor's in music ed., master's in jazz performance.The video was tossed in the trash. A horrible product!"
1,Charged but haven't received,"Ordered on the Dec 7th, Charge hit Dec 8th but must be taking a slow boat or something because it is now Dec 20th?"
5,An excellent collaboration between two top EBM bands.,"Bringing together :wumpscut: and haujobb. is a godsend to the industrial/EBM world. Although the original version of :wumpscut:'s ""Die In Winter"" is masterful stroke, haujobb.'s remix of it on this EP takes it to another plane of musical existence altogether. :wumpscut:'s remix of haujobb.'s ""Nezzwerk"" is also outstanding. If you're a fan of either band or if you've ever heard this version of ""Die In Winter"" in a club and grooved on it, you should get this CD."
2,This was NOT a page-turner!,"I recently finished the wildflower series, and can I say BORING??? I'm sorry, but V.C.'s books are going downhill, after the ghost writer took the place of the original writer herself. Hey, what am I to say? It's only my opinion, right? Right. Anyway, the only story that even interested me a bit was the one about Star. The one about Cat was... WHOA! Wait a minute, the one about Cat I had no comment whatsoever. All I can say is... eww! The Jade story was okay, but the only cool part was when she met the person she found on the net. Let's just say... it was... well... unexpected. In my opinion, the Misty one was the most boring. Anyway, these are just my opinions. Who knows... someone out there in the world might disagree with me and like these stories. You know what though? I prefer the older books written by the REAL V.C. Andrews herself. This new ghost writer is just a shame. Toodles. :D"
3,could be better,"the two stories truthfully worth it were star's and cat's. yet cat's story was severly down played, and seemed written worse than the rest. cat's was the story you look forward to, rush through the whole book to get to, and find it rather disappointing. yet, this book wasn't so horrible. i have a friend who has been through a divorce and she found it a good story. yet the writing could have been better in cases. drop the rich people; you can try to do good with the whole idea, but it doesn't work in this case. yet part of jade's story was a very good idea, however shortened to merely 3 (?) pages and downplayed horribly (the whole part about the guy over the 'net). that might have made it more interesting. but this isn't my usual type of book."
2,Orphans were a slight bit better...,"I had to admit, I liked the orphans way better than these wildflower girls. The only wildflower that I liked was Cat, because she seemed sweet, smart, and kind. The other girls were bratty...especially Jade. Jade needs to be punished for being such a brat...so much like Gisselle from the Landry series - spoiled, bratty, and rich. Are all the girls rich? Hmmmmm...I don't know. I wasted my money and I regret doing so."
4,ten popular Bedouin love songs,"from website:""Desert Rose is a very interesting look into the world of Arabic love songs. Taking ten popular Bedouin love songs, this compilation showcases the exotic sounds of the Middle East. At times the music can begin to blend together, but the diverse instruments and sounds found on these songs keep things fresh throughout. Anyone looking to broaden their musical horizon to Arabic music may want to search out this album; it is a good place to start."" ~ Bradley Torreano, All Music Guide"
4,An excellent look at Jackie's early childhood.,"If one is interested in learning about Jackie Kennedy's early childhood and teen years, this is the perfect book to examine. The author, a cousin of the late First Lady, shared many of her early experiences and thus provides excellent primary source material. Also noteworthy are photographs from Jackie's childhood and teen years"
2,an ok book,"This book was good, but it only talked about her childhood. There was nothing about Onassis and her life after she married JFK. It didn't even mention her kids. John H. Davis also needs to learn to stick to the subject, he would often wonder off into stories about himself. If I cared about him I would have gotten a book about John H. Davis, but I didn't, I got a book on Jacqueline Bouvier. No one really cares what she did day by day of her childhood. We just really need the basic stuff. My final words are that it was a good book about her childhood and thats it, so i believe this book doesn't deserve more than two stars because there was more to Jacqueline's life than just her childhood and it doesn't even talk about her White House expirence or how she died."
1,"Interesting idea, boring story and characters.","The concept was very interesting, but after about 50 or so pages, I found the world was very gimicky and the characters were boring. The plot itself didn't really interest me, either. I found myself skimming pages just to get to the end."
3,Just okay.,"I have quite a few Angel Cards and I have to be honest and say these are not my favorites. The packaging is cute and it might make a nice gift for someone who is interested in Angel cards, or even a teenager, but for my personal tastes, I feel there are other decks that are more helpful. Doreen Virtue's Angel and Fairy cards are wonderful and beautiful and I also like the Angel Messages cards. They are terrific, too."
4,OK!! But not like the original ECW.,"ECW ruled!! The action, the excitement, the blood, catfights, etc.This DVD is a good Show, buy its like trying to relive thing from the past, just doesnt happen.Its good, buy I defenitely prefer the Rise and Fall of ECW, with Real ECW Matches, History and more!!"
4,Awsome DVD,"If you're an ECW fan, you MUST own this DVD. Sure, there is a little bit of editing, but what WWE isn't edited (Old WWF sign blurred all of the time.) This event had it all, from awesome matches to great shoot promos. The Mike Awesome vs. Masato Tanaka match stole the show by far. The only real dud match was Mysterio vs. Psicosis. It could have been so much more was utter garabage. The JBL commentary is weird and people can criticise it all they want, but if they don't like it, turn it off. The only gripe I have about this DVD is that the ECW funeral from raw is on here but is shown in clips. They also could have put in the Chris Benoit vs. Tajiri match from RAW when all the ECW guys came out and started a fight with WWE. Overall, you won't regret getting this DVD. Don't forget to get Hardcore Homecoming as well, because it was a little better than this."
5,ECW Baby,great Shape got it in no time at all. very happy with it all. looking forword to getting more ecw dvds
2,No licensed Metallica Music,"One of the Highpoints of this DVD's recording would have been the Sandman's entrance to Metallica's ENTER SANDMAN song. During the original PPV, they played it, but WWE did not buy the DVD distribution rights.As a result, we get a generic-cised music overlay during his 5+ minute ring entrance, with all commentary having to be stripped out of it. The Dudley Boys music has been changed too.If you really want the original PPV experience, try to trade a tape of someone who recorded it. If you want a high quality recording and can live with these shortfalls, then get this DVD.Bad move WWE."
1,Not the real deal...,"I get all my ECW from ECW666 Videos. They have every ECW show in its entirety and are authentic, not Vince's version. Check them out at http://ecw666.cjb.net . I get my videos within 3 days of ordering and they have the best prices hands down"
3,"ECW ECW, give me a break","ECW is so old and people need to give it up. ECW was good back in the day but trying to bring back a ppv for only one night makes no sense at all. i know the ppv was emotional and it was fun to see for that one night, but the card was full of washed up wrestlers like sandman, and Tommy dreamer who do not have it anymore. good if you like nonstop hardcore wrestling that is good but needs something besides that. other wrestlers like super crazy, sabu, and chris benoit who carried the ppv in there own right. the matches where too short and very dissaponting in my opinion. Don't fear wrestling fans becuase there is a promotion named combat zone wrestling that will blow you hardcore fans away. i recommend you to check it out. one more thing CZW CZW CZW"
3,ecw is good but not great,1st match chris jerio vs lance storm winner lance storm. 2nd match super crazy vs tajari vs little guido winner super crazy. 3rd match rey mystiro vs psichosis winner rey mystireo. 4th match rhyno vs sabu winner sabu. 5th match eddie guerrero vs chris benoit winner chris benoit. 6th match mike awesome vs masteo tanaka winner mike awesome. 7th match tommy dreamer and sandman vs dudlays winners dudlays.
4,Something you should know,"WWE cut out alot the ECW Pay-Per-View, Some of the things they cut out were chants and sandmans intro. Live would be 5 stars but its not as good on dvd because its edited."
1,Vince is the Devil,"This PPV was great... perhaps the most emotional and heartfelt show I've ever had the pleasure of watching. And while understand them having to "" bleep "" out the F word on the live feed, I was very pleased to see that a few less bleeps appear here...Only... where's the Roadkill/ Doring promo that they aired out of order. And why in hell did they need to edit out the "" Enter Sandman "" and dub in a bogus B.S soundtrack?It's not only taken the crowd angle out of the disc, but has tainted the whole package...I Vince Mcmahon... I hate WWE... I hate that this is what the fans are left with. Perhaps if Paul E was Fu@king his daughter and not Triple H, the product would be taken seriously!That and JBL being allows a bonus feature after attacking a worker in the ring...This is a friggin joke."
1,What is this crap?,"Why in the world would Vince want to change anything on this great show. All of the swearing has been taken out and the best part of the show has been changed. That is right, The evil vince has taken the sandmans entrance, the best part of the show and has placed some crappy genirc music and edited the crowd. Why would you want to screw all of the ECW fans out of there money. Dont tell me you cant get the rights to Enter Sandman, you have enough money to compromise with Metallica, i mean they have worked with them before. Dont waste your money on this dvd. Any true ECW fan would not and im not. No need to buy it if you ordered it on ppv. I never thought i would see the day that i would give an ECW show a one star and the show was excellent. I should not be surprised though, i mean vince is the one who has the final say."
3,Not as bad as it seems.,"If you were really excited about this dvd, chances are its not gonna be as good as you think. However if you think this dvd is gonna suck, chances are its better than you think. Wwe didnt do a good job in fully explaining all the action your gonna find in this dvd. Im sure its to keep the element of suprise fresh because there are alot of suprises on this dvd. Alot more than the box says. All in all it coulda been better, mostly if it didnt have so many Raw and Smackdown goons in it. But it is deff a must have for a true ECW fan."
4,"Ok stories, but amazing presentation!","There are three basic stories within this collection that help the reader to build their knowledge of one Ms. Power Girl. They start with a very early story, one in the 70's, and then one recently from Geoff Johns. The middle one is where they tried to give her an Atlantean background and it was quite silly and boring. Though the collection of stories aren't stellar the collection and presentation is amazing. They editors given an intro to each section and really try to help build a foundation for DC fans to become acquainted with and more knowledgeable of Power Girl. I would recommend this to anyone who would like to know more about this character because in this collection the sum is definitely worth more then the parts individually."
2,Now it all makes sense!! Um......no!,"I decided to check this trade out to learn more about Power Girl and where she comes from. After reading it I can say that I'm more confused now than ever before. While the book contained different origin stories from the seventies, eighties, and the modern version all I got out of was that no one has come up with a definitive origin yet. The book is a hodgepodge of Power Girl and the modern main storyline serves no purpose as PG is just as confused as readers. The art by Amanda Conner is decent yet not spectacular. One thing that does bother me about her art is the constant smirk on her characters faces. It usually doesn't mesh with the story. Overall, I think this book can easily be passed by."
2,"Water has ""plastic"" taste","Primo Five (5) Gallon Bulk Bottled WaterWe purchased a new water cooler recently and also purchased this 5 gallon jug with water from Primo. The water has a distinct ""plastic"" taste that is seriously off-putting. We plan to refill it at the water store down the street and hope that a different water brand will not have the same taste - although we suspect that leaching from the Primo plastic bottle may well ruin any water that ends up in it. If a second batch proves to taste like plastic we will be ditching this bottle and going with another product. We didn't purchase a water cooler and bottled water so that we could taste plastic....."
1,Bad water Bad company,"Water definitely has a plastic taste. You buy the bottle and the water at Lowes, apparently Amazon, but guess what, the bottle is not a deposit item, so you never get the cost of the bottle back, which leads to only refills of their water which is truly awful. The company Primo should not be allowed to to be in business with such an ungreen approach to filling landfills with 5 gal bottles. If you own them they are yours to get rid of? They should be tarred and feathered."
2,"Contains BPA-leaching plastic, so not happy about that. Otherwise it's fine.","We bought this water bottle to reuse, and after months of refilling it found out it contains BPA-leaching plastic. BPA is on the list of Toxic Substances in Canada, and is slowly being banned in baby products everywhere. So we're not comfortable drinking our daily water out of it! Otherwise, we've had no problem with this product."
1,Tedious,"I saw reference to this in an excellent book by Gail Greene, Insomniac, and ordered it used. The rest that she didn't quote is not worth reading, unfortunately. A bit of British cleverness, but overall not enough to make it readable, and I am a die-hard Anglophile. I gave up after about 50 pages and put it in the donation bag."
5,Looks great!,"Wasn't the easiest to install but it was worth it, I looks good, I just need to put the fog lights and speed grilles in."
3,"Great Idea, Poorly Executed","Overall, this is an okay drill. The releasable chuck is a great idea, however, it isn't made well enough. The chuck assembly is weak, allowing bits to fall out. The tolerances for the chuck are so loose that drill bits tend to orbit. This is a good drill for light duty, household use."
1,Avoid this product,"I agree with other reviewers - this drill is worthless because the chuck won't hold a bit. I like the concept and I got a great deal on it ($62) but in the end I took it back because A DRILL THAT WON'T HOLD A BIT IS WORTHLESS. I ended up getting a 12 volt Bosch and I am much happier now - more expensive, but I find the single-handed locking chuck just as easy to swap bits as with the Firestorm setup and I know I have a much better quality product. I have yet to find a Black and Decker product that is worthwhile and probably never will, since I am done ever purchasing their stuff. Also, this is coming from a weekend hobbyist doing home improvment projects and not from a professional contractor."
1,on the right track but missed the mark,"although b&d is not know for high quality tools, i thought this one looked promising. boy was i wrong. the removable chuck was a great idea but not made well. bits sliped and the chuck does not spin true. battery life is short also. IT has an led for a leveler which is far from accurate. The main reason why i gave it 1 star is because i was able the strip second gear out compleatly by drilling a 1/4 inch hole in a 2x4. which was most unexpected since the low gear was able counter sink large wood screws in a 4x4. might be good for light use thats it. i now have a 12 volt dewalt xrp which is a very powerful tool and well worth the extra [money]."
1,This Drill is Horrible - DO NOT BUY FROM BLACK AND DECKER,I bought the Firestorm Drill and also the cordless circular saw. Each came with a battery charger. Both chargers went bad in the first 12 months. Black and Decker refused to fix either of them - or replace them - so I shelled out $... for another charger from the service center. My third charger just went bad and Black and Decker refuses to do anything except tell me to buy another.NEVER BUY BLACK AND DECKER PRODUCTS.
5,Best there is,I Got this thinking I need one of these. Don't we all?The Removable/Quick Connect Chuck is a Gosh Dang Miracle of a Added Design.I have TRIED to find another just so I can have a back up but have found the design has been removed.STUPIDEST thing they every did.If you got one Grates if you missed it you missed the Best.Not saying the Drill is the best but with its design I said Screw the rest I want this one Over and Over again.Hope to hell someone will Bring back the quick connect chuck.
4,"Looks Good, Average Protection","This mask looks awesome! Unfortunately, all those cool looking vents don't stop paint from getting through very well. If you take a shot in the face below the goggles, prepare to feel a sharp sting on your lip! Also, it's difficult to clean in some of the grooves, especially right underneath the goggles.The goggles fog up a little also, but nothing horrible. After a minute or so, the fog will clean out and you can see again."
2,it is what it is,"ok so i owned this mask for 2 yrs thinking it was the best i could get i spend 40 or so dollars on it.This is a 20 dollar mask, if you get it for that or less great use it but for 65 you can get a v force profiler.This mask fogged on me standing still every time even with headbands if your moving great will keep from fogging.If you get hit in the face the double vent keeps most paint off you wonderfully. But if you cant see your gonna get hit in the face a lot."
1,Horrible Book,Never mind my last comment. This book is completely horrible. It is packed full of information the authors simply made up. Honestly the most disgusting book ever written. I deserve to be kicked in my microscopic balls for writing this.
2,Product didn't do anything for me,"This product didn't do anything to help me have better curls (my hair is wavy which will curl up better with the right products). I like the spray bottle a lot though, so I emptied it out & filled it up with a nonaerosol hairspray."
4,Pretty good for what it is.,"These little wire saws work decently on smaller branches/saplings. Don't expect to be cutting down redwoods or oaks with it though. Cutting down a couple 3"" pine saplings for a simple tarp shelter took me about 10 minutes. Not bad for something that fits in your pocket and weighs virtually nothing. I like it."
3,Works but not more,The sink cover works but not more. I needed it because my cats love the sink and sleep in there or eat everything that is left on a plate. I bought this item because it was one of the few I found.It says it will not rattle but that seems to be depending on the size of your sink. It works kind of OK on one of mine and not that great on the other.It does the job of not letting my cats in so it is OK.
2,One size doensn't fit all,"I believed the ad that said this product fits all sizes, with the caveat that it was not a chopping board. So, I bought a plastic chopping surface. Thing is, the board does NOT fit all sizes. I was disappointed about that little detail."
5,Best Live Blues Album,"They say there's only one thing better than live blues, and listening to this recording makes you believe that. The blues are best when they're live, and many studio recordings just don't capture the energy of the music (like a black-and-white Monet). But this album is as close as you can get without actually being there. I have never so much wanted to sink right into a recording and be there when they recorded it. The raw energy and howling blues are incredible. If I could only have one blues album--this would be it!"
4,Get 'King of the Electric Blues' instead,"This stuff is all great, but the CD 'King of the Electric Blues', (part of the Columbia Legacy Mojo Working: Blues for the Next Generation series) contains 5 of the 7 tracks on this CD, plus 10 more from other Muddy albums from the same era. It's a great collection and I would recommend that over this one. 'Live' was released on CD in 1989 and 'King of the Electric Blues' was released in 1997, so it is sure to have better sound quality as well."
1,Enjoy it while you can.,"On initial opening I was very pleased with this watch. The fake vintage-ness of it looked great. However, after having worn it for a few days its flaws became very apparent.The most noticeable flaw is the over sized crown. It looks great but constantly comes loose because it's too large. This causes it to stop time on the watch, and with enough wrist movement, winds the hands back and forth. At least once a day I have to reset the time. What use is a watch that can't keep time?Then I accidentally dropped the watch while putting it on one day. It was no more then 4 feet off the ground and now the hands are motionless and the crown doesn't function. Any decently built watch should be able to survive a short drop on carpet.Don't waste your money."
5,Mickey Mouse Watch,Watch was recieved as described and shipped as promised. Very pleased with purchase.
2,Disappointed,"I am disappointed with the quality of this watch in general. The face does not light up, the shape of the hands make accurate reading an impossibility, and worst of all, it doesn't keep time! Don't waste your money."
3,Outstanding Collection - Unfortunately Only Edited Versions Or Would Be 5 Stars,"The title of this post says it all. Jam packed with great tracks but none are the full length versions. If you listen to mainstream radio a lot and it doesn't bother you to listen to edited versions and you don't mind not having the whole song as it was originally done, by all means, buy this. However, if you check out 100% Acid Vol. 1, combine the track lists and you will have a great list of tracks to chase down in their full length versions and/or their remix versions. As with Vol. 1, I also personally have 13 of these tracks in this collection in their original and/or remix versions and will check out the ones that i don't have since the overall selection is really outstanding. These are great collections but they should release them again in another series with the full length versions or their best remix versions."
3,M37/Power Wagon locking hubs,"You get what you pay for. These are much less expensive and are cheap compared to Selectro hubs. For me, that is ok b/c I'd rather break a hub with a lifetime warranty than an axle or u-joint.In short, I would recommend them for non-commercial use. My M37's since 1999 used these hubs w/o a failure. BTW: since 2004, I've snow plowed and rock crawled with them on a Dodge M37"
4,Keeps the bumps away,"Yeah, very little razor burn, but not a very close shave. Still leaves me a bit prickly. I've found that it's good to do a once over with the coochy cream, and then a once over with other shaving cream. The coochy creme leaves a bit of a residue on your skin that protects you from bumps when you shave the second time around."
1,Clueless,"Sometimes when you hear a really terrible piece of work you ask yourself ""How did this get to be made?"" They must have known (or at least Ray Wilson must have known) that it wasn't working. Why then finish it off? Even worse, why inflict this trash on the public. I like Genesis and made the terrible mistake of purchasing the Cut album. They are a poor covers band. The Bowie cover is criminal."
5,Can't make up my mind which version I like more!!,"Absolutly charming!! We caught this on PBS, and I am ever so happy that I did!!! More TV and movies should be like this!! Clean, wholesome, with a very good message, and oh my gosh, ENTERTAINING AT THE SAME TIME!!! Who would have thought it possible! Varies from the Disney version, not sure who follows the book more, haven't read it yet. Both versions are adorable, heartwarming and will bring a few tears to your eyes. I highly recommend picking up both copies today!!"
4,Treat Yourself to This,"Georgina Terry plays Pollyanna with a sweet faced, ever-happy style that suits the plot. It's pretty faithful to the original plot of the missionary's daughter, orphaned and coming to live with a strict aunt. As Pollyanna plays her ""Glad Game"" and teaches it to the problem characters, the villagers' lives are transformed. Everyone from the reclusive misanthrope to the chronically ill to the town doctor find new ways of looking at life from interacting with the little girl.The very name Pollyanna is now synonymous for unreasoning optimism due to this book. I loved this story when I read it as a child and am glad they treated it well in this remake.The costumes and setting fit very well (although the original book was not English) and have the usual high quality of a Masterpiece Theater production.I had to knock off a star because sometimes the actors spoke too fast or breathlessly so some of the dialogue is lost."
5,Children's Tale that Adults can enjoy!,"I was always a big favorite of the Haley Mills version, but this one is far superior - and much more believable. It never insults your intelligence - and gives you a far better understanding into the characters.The UK shooting scenery is gorgeous and not matter how old you are, the ending will bring a tear to the eye."
5,Watch it again and again,"This version of Pollyanna is a joy for all ages. We love this one the best. The British actors, locations, etc. I love the quilt on her bed!!"
2,Disappointed,"After watching the 1993 BBC version (Elizabeth Archard), this is a disappointment. I just wish the 1993 version was available on DVD!"
5,"If you love Anne of Green Gables, you'll love this movie","I am a big fan of the Haley Mills' version and so I watched this movie with some trepidation. I was happily surprised. The actress playing Pollyanna is adorable, believable and the story has a wonderful, more satisfying ending.Loved it!!"
1,Someone Put On the lights,This has got to be the worst horror movie ever.It takes place in a cavewhere a team of explorers sets out to explore.They discover their not alone that somethings hunting them and killing them one by one.The problem is the movie is too dark.With only glimpses of light.Aslo the sound quailty was poorand the quick flashing of scenes was just plain annoying.How this movie got two awards is a mystery to me.Also the ending was stupid.
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!!!,"They call this a horror film. the only thing horrific is that i actually paid money for this. i bought this ACCIDENTLY. I had intended to buy a movie called 'The Cave', but was in a rush and somehow managed to grab this instead. I had it in my dvd player before i realised my mistake, so i could not return it. Well i wish i could because this is terrible! Its one of those films shot mostly in the dark, where you never actually get a good look at the monster thats killing everyone. I usually can tolerate any movie, regardless of how bad it is or how pathetic the storyline is as long as it's horror, but trust me- if you want a corny, cheesy, gorey horror flick, this is not the way to go. it's just bad"
1,Drivelous,"Don't be confused by those olive branches on the DVD cover, branches which signify a movie that has won a film fest or is a fan favorite at the fest.This movie was horrible, among the worst I have ever seen. I haven't looked close enough at the DVD case to see which film fest this movie won. Perhaps the ""Erratic Shaky Camera"" fest, the ""Thank God It Was Only An Hour Long"" fest, or maybe the ""Films Which End In Rape"" fest?Horrible. I wish I could punch the face of the person who decided we needed to see a 30 second rape at the very end of the movie."
1,this movie is missing a 2-hour bonus dvd of the cast and crew apologizing,"If it were possible to leave negative stars I would. The plot is weak, the actors are unconvincing, the details and effect revolve mostly around complete darkness, poor editing and bad camera angles. There are unexplained squishy noises coming a dead body in the first half of the film, and a dead body (I kid you not) rolls out of the way to avoid getting squished by one of the still living characters. There's copious amounts of unexplained blood exploding in different scenes and for no reason their lights keep dimming (who goes spelunking without a few glo-sticks anyway?) when there's danger.This was such a waste of fake blood and my rental fees."
1,Can I give this 0 stars? Worst movie I have ever seen!!!!!!!!!,"WARNING!!!! This is the biggest piece of cr@p I have ever seen!!! I want that hour and a half of my life back!!! (And my money) No plot, frequent periods in the movie where the screen goes black and everyone screams, and a ridiculous explanation and ending with a totally gratuitous rape scene finished off this awful movie."
1,Total waste of time,"What a complete waste of my time - watching this piece of garbage!The first five or so minutes of the movie were not too bad but it went quickly downhill (or underground) after that.Terrible cinematography. The shots outside the cave were varying shades of putrid color; the balance of the movie inside the cave were basically lit (sometimes) with a flashlight.Some of the acting wasn't terrible but you couldn't see the actors.Disjointed, implausible storyline.Don't waste your time with this one. If you want to watch a much better movie with caves, watch eitherSanctumorThe Descent (Original Unrated Widescreen Edition)."
1,trash of the century.........,"Lured by the claim that this is ""shriekist movie of the year"" on the box, I rented it to watch with my family.......turns out the only shrieks are my family hurling abuses at me for picking this stupid movie.....(/_\)"
1,"Very, very, very bad","Now, this movie is the ""The Blair Witch Project"" of cave movies. Not that it is a mystery, because it is filmed so shakey that you can't see most of the movie. Actually, I liked the ""The Blair Witch Project"" the way it was filmed. There was no reason that this film should have been produced this way. The cinematography was so bad that you can't really see the movie. It was filmed sideways, upside down and very shakey. I thought that this was a very bad produced independant film. The story could have been a good one but the director ruined it. Also, the acting of actors started out very good in the begining, but then turned very bad about in the middle and the end of the movie. I don't recommend this movie for anyone to see. What I do recommend is using this DVD for a sun catcher in your window."
1,Shouldn't get even 1 star,"Probably the worst movie I have ever watched. I could tell from the opening music it would be low budget but this was beyond awful - just full of gratuitous violence, no plotline, terrible sets and camera work you wouldn't even believe. At several points the screen goes completely black. it is just awful - run away from this as fast as you can!"
1,Totally Unnecessary Brutalizing of Women,"I actually thought the movie wasn't bad because I thought the monster in the few scenes where you could actually see it was pretty freaky and well done. And the supernatural undertones were creepy at first. Fast forward to the end....The creature ends up to be human, then proceeds to brutally rape the last survivor, right into the end credits. Just another snotnosed punk director using ""creative license"" to throw a classless and unnecessary scene in. He explained in the comments mode that he just wanted to show everyone that the guy 'thought' about becoming human again, then just so he could drive it home that he was a monster, made him do the most monstrous act you could do. This was about the same as the jerk that created the 'super columbine massacre' computer game because he thought it would drive debate about the role of video games in society. Bravo, Mr.Osunsanmi. You are a disgrace to raped women everywhere."
1,0 STARS: Garbage,"""The Cavern"" is a seriously horrible film with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Armed with a pathetic cast, asinine direction and a ludicrous script, ""The Cavern"" redefines the word garbage in one of the worst films this reviewer has ever seen. Alas, I could not finish this movie because of how utterly stupid that it was. Basically, a creature kills people one at a time in a cavern. It did not sound bad to me, but it did not take long for me to figure out that I was watching garbage as I have seen enough bad horror films to know garbage when I see it, and ""The Cavern"" is literally garbage."
1,A Vile Film,"The story is a joke, the characters are unlikeable prats, the lightning gives you a headache and to top it all off, it ends in the middle of graphic rape scene shoehorned in for shock value. Avoid this film at all costs"
4,This film is fine...not as bad as it sounds at all,"Til this day, I still don't know what people look for in movies anymore...I hear so much whining about this and that. The Cavern is fine, its not a masterpiece, but its a decent and simple independent suspense film. I guess the 99% of the reviews here, giving it 1/5 stars, really helped lower my expectations for this movie.Its worth a watch. Its a good film, as long as you're not one of those people who need to be super-analytical over low-budget movies."
1,Save your money,"Should be 0 stars. Written in Crayola. This cheap attempt to ride the publicity of The Cave and The Descent offers nothing but dimly lite jump cuts shot on a sound stage cave set, lots of red herrings that go nowhere, and no payoff.This one will make even the lovers of the average ""Sci-Fi Channel"" fare cringe."
1,Spoiler Alert,"Actually, seeing this film is the spoiler. It is about a group of young men and women who explore a cave in an uncharted region of Kazakhstan.The group becomes trapped and each member is, predictably, eliminated one by one. In the last 5 minutes or so, after everyone but the 2 women are killed, we learn that the 'beast' that has been stalking the crew is actually a man who, orphaned as a young boy in a small plane crash nearby, has been living in the caves as some sort of modern day neanderthal. It would seem his interest in the women is not culinary.The story has potential, however the cinematography is abysmal. Visually, it's hard to follow thanks to overzealous use of hypershake, dust, fog, upside down and sideways shots, flashlight closeups and complete blackouts.Overall, I have to concur with the others here. This film was jarring on the nerves and pointless until the last few seconds. By then it was too little too late. Out of a possible score of 1-5, I give this film a -10."
1,Where are the zero stars when you need them...?,This movie was so bad I am not even going to waste my time writing a review. I will sum it up with two words BAD MOVIE!
1,"Wished it would have lived up, to it's cover art.","I Absolutely Love the Cover art for this movie. Saying that, i expected a good movie. I Was Wrong. I Turned it off, about half way through. thats how boring it was. And not just being boring, I Couldnt hardly see ANY of the movie. At the Beggining, the movie, had a Red tint to it, and the rest of the way through, it was bitch black, and the only way you knew something bad was happening, was by the audio."
1,"Really, really bad","I could go on about how awful this movie is, but others have done that already. Suffice to say that they are right and you should heed their word.What is actually frightening about this movie is that somebody thought is was good enough to sell! And make!Regretfully it was a novel idea... sort of. But a whole lot went wrong in the making.I gave it one star for originality... kind of. I would wait until this comes on an off channel on television and there's absolutely nothing else on to watch. Don't waste your money even renting it."
3,Not that bad,"I've read a lot of bad stuff about this movie, but I've got to say... Don't believe the hype. I thought The Cavern got a really bad rap that it does not deserve. Okay, it's not great. Sometimes it's even annoying! The end did have me scratching my head... but it's totally decent overall."
4,"Not really that bad, give it a chance. Creepy atmosphere, and well done gore effects!","I saw this film before reading any reviews on it. I really enjoyed it and couldn't believe the bad reviews I read afterwards. This is a low-budget picture, so some of the acting is not the best, but I loved the atmosphere and the way the filmmakers concentrated on SUSPENSE! There were some really well done kills in this flick and lots of creepiness. I was scared and tensed up through most of it. I can understand why some viewers might feel a bit ripped off by the ending, but I actually appreciated how well it was done so as to stay away from getting too cheesy. A great cave picture, and better than a couple other cave films I've seen lately; The Cave, Hillside Cannibals. I think this film was just as good as The Descent."
5,Connie Salazar sings her faith! not just songs!,"I attended the same church as Ms. Salazar for almost 9 years. Her recordings can't touch her live voice, but nonetheless they are beautiful songs for those who believe in Jesus Christ."
5,Absolutely Adorable Little Birds,These are very well made. Sturdy and just as cute as can be. Everyone who sees them in my garden wants to know where I got them. I will be purchasing some more they are so nice.
2,Value depends on the price of the day,"All of the above reviews are correct. They are nice looking and moderately functional. I may pour some concrete to overcome some of the functional problems it has. The stake needs to go deeper into the ground to keep it from coming out. At $10.99 however, it was a great bargain, and a 4 star rating. At it's current winter sale price of $16.99 however, it is a 1 star rating. I'll average them weighting it's current price and give it 2 stars."
5,Sublime Perfection,The title is perfect for this album for it communicate a world weary lost in a blues type of feeling that has a zen-like acceptance as communicated by the the most beautiful voice ever recorded in this genre of music. This work is a therapeutic time-capsule to anyone's heartache.
5,Quietly Majestic,"The musical world is a much more interesting place thanks to the individualism of Tim Buckley. This gently hypnotic, quietly majestic album was a treasure to come across. Tim's poetic, lyrical line hangs suspended in the air like a fragile thread, supported by his own twelve string strumming, drums, xylophone and bass; the sparse, jazz tinged instrumentation is full of atmosphere that gives the cutting reality of his words a diffuse cushion to weigh upon. The modest beginnings of each song soon unfold into a panoramic vision.Why Tim Buckley's recordings haven't been given the 24-bit remastering attention that was given to The Doors still amazes me. His music would benefit much from that as the recordings are good but his delivery is often soft. Blue Afternoon is a gem and as with all of Tim's work it needs to be remastered in it's original state without further delay."
5,Wonderful materials,The member's kit is required for all first time members of the First Place Program. The kit is comprehensive with all the materials needed to get started on a healthier life style. The motivational CD is wonderful. The books are full of information that will transform your life. Excellent resource for an excellent program. You will need to find out which Bible study your group is using which is in addition to this kit.
2,NOT ONE RECIPE!,"I appreciated the advice and explanation of the program, but I'd also mistakenly expected recipes....anything...something. Nope, not a one. It's a great program overview! But there isn't one single recipe in it. If you are expecting a plan overview plus a few sample recipes, this is not it."
2,useless,"Well, you need to have this kit for the group, but the bible studies are not included, you can purchase the committment cards elsewhere, plus committment cards are included in the back of the bible study books. My suggestion is before spending eighty dollars on this kit, hook up with others in the class, purchase one kit. Trust me what little info is in the kit you can read in a day."
2,This kit was perfectly okay,"Was just disappointed. It was advertised as the New First Place Member's Kit, but was very outdated. It may have been the new kit, I was looking for the updated version. Considered returning it."
2,Parts already discontinued,"This was a good tool for what I used it for until the main drive belt broke (a $3.48 part). All websites show it is discontinued and not other substitutions are available. Basically it is a paperweight now and I will have to buy a new sander. I can understand discontinuing some parts, but parts like the drive belt which WILL break in time, shouldn't be unavailable. Two stars just because it did last a year with intermittent use."
3,Average,"It was delivery on time and got the perfume; however, I paid for ""Gift Wrap"" and they didn't do it. After complaining, I was told they would refund my money but after two weeks I have not gotten the money refunded, yet."
5,Kiefer at his best,The story line holds my attention to the end. And what a bittersweet end it is... Great acting by Kiefer and Kyra Sedgwick.
5,Miscue,"Nothing beats a page-turner, and that's what you have as you are drawn into this mystery from the first page to the last. What a great Christmas gift this will make! Can't wait for Allison's next Kindle release."
5,Excellent first novel!,"Having read Miscue twice and being a discerning fan of mysteries of every ilk, I feel qualified to say that Glen Allison's first book deserves a place on every bookstore's best-selling mystery/thriller shelf. Excellent writing coupled with fascinating characters make the book a stay-up-late-to-finish-it-even-if-I-have-to work-tomorrow kind of story. In spite of his problems (or maybe because of them) Al Forte is a guy you just have to root for. Miscue is an enjoyable read and, hopefully, the first of many Forte novels."
2,Drill bit slippage galore,"slips like crazy. tried all the tricks to keep bits from slipping. finally used bits with the hex head quick connect. it's off by a just a hair so all the bits wobble. this doesn't affect using screwdriver bits but now as a drill, it is useless. of course, it's out of warranty."
2,Not up to a real job,I have used this drill for over 6 months now and I can say that I hate it. Its clutch slips even when screwing into the softest of woods. I have seen a 12v cheap drill run circles around it in the most simple of jobs. I would tell anyone who would listen to go get a Dewalt. My Dewalt 18v can beat anything except for Dewalt's nicer models.
2,You get what you pay for.,"I bought the 18 volt Firestorm drill kit with two batteries and was initially pleased with the price and performance.After approximately 14 months one of the batteries and the charger both failed. Now I am stuck with a drill, one battery and no way to charge it unless I buy a new charger. Even then, I still would have only one battery. I have learned that the gears in the drill are plastic and the stalling out I read about in other reviews is a common affliction.Overall, it has not been a purchase that I am happy with, but when you shop price Vs quality you are at risk. My Dewalt 12 volt runs circles around the B&D; 18 volt, so draw your own conclusions."
2,Nice Tool - Bad Chargers,"Love all the firestorm tools. Good prices. HOWEVER, none of my 3 chargers has lasted more than a year. arghghgh. Something is way wrong here. be warned."
3,"Good Idea,poor chuck","I bought this item because they had a good idea in the handy change over from drill to driver.But they skimped on the quality of the chuck.That is a shame because it defeated the whole purpose of the tool.I took the first one back to the store and got another one,but it was just as bad.Maybe they will come out with a good chuck later!"
3,Great Drill if you don't want to spend a lot of money.,"I purchased this drill about 10 months ago for the incredible price of [$$$] on clearence at Home Depot. I was looking at the Dewalts but decided for [$$$], this is a steal. Overall the drill has plenty of power and feels good in your hand when in use. The removeable chuck is a good ideal but it really takes away from the quality of the drill. The chuck has a tendency to slip and I also notice a slight wobble. Another thing I wish is that it came with a 1 hr charger versus a 3 hr charger. Overall, it's a good drill for home projects and has plenty of power. For [$$$] bucks I can't complain too much. After all, where are you going to find a 18v drill for that price."
1,Fire Storm Fizzel,"I have had several cordless drils over the years, but this is the worst. I got this drill at Home Depot approx. 6mo. ago , i have uset it about 20 times ,with small home projects . I went to use it the other day and the clutch went out on the third screw. I took it back to the Home Depot, but I couldn't find my receipt, and they told me that Black and Decker would not take it back. So I'm stuck with a piece of junk. I have 2 good battery's and a good charger , but no drill to use them. I won't buy any Black and Decker product again."
5,ON TIME DELIVERY,This product was delivered on time and seems to be the original. I bought a curve where i live and the scent just burns my nostrils. This curve does not and it smells great. I would only like for the scent to last the entire day when i use it. Very timely delivered. All hail.
3,Smells Good,"I have yet to get any compliments with this cologne. Thats probably because the scent is gone after 20 minutes of spraying it on, or so they tell me. It does smell good though. It comes with a little clip that goes in the gap where the top is pressed down, my guess is to keep it from spraying itself?"
5,I dig it,"I bought this as an alternative to my other more expensive cologne, and have worn it every day since I received it. I love the scent. It lasts all day and you can't beat the price."
5,Excellent Seller and Fragrance!,"Ordered and it was here in no time. 5 stars to the seller and the product. Great packaging also. Curve Wave is a very ocean powered scent with a well placed note of masculinity. Not musky at all with a citrusy, minty smell as well. Great buy!"
4,Cologne is a thing of personal preference.,"I believe reviews for Colognes need to be taken with caution since we all have a different sense of smell. Having said that, I rated this 4 stars based on some comparisons. My all time top favorite cologne is Cool Water by Davidoff. For those of you who have smelled it know of the very 'cool', 'refreshing', 'awakening' type smell that it has. I have also tended to like the original Curve (Gold box) based on which I brought this Curve Wave. After my initial use of Curve Wave, I can't say I was disappointed but it was also not the wow factor or best cologne (as per my personal preference in smell). Now I use it as my secondary cologne. It was a good value at under $20 for 4.2 oz. And if you're wondering, I have not gotten any compliments (regarding my scent) in the almost 2 months I've been wearing Curve Wave, where as compliments were frequently received with Cool Water."
5,Curve Wave for men,"Wonderful product. The description was accurate and I had received more than what I had expected. The insert inside the can protects the cologne, which surprised me. I have another type of curve and the can did not come with the insert to protect the cologne which is in a glass bottle. I am very impressed, and would recommend this product."
5,Husband Loves it!,For the price we paid this was a steal! My husband loves this cologne and I do too! Its not a heavy scent. I love it!
1,Fake,"I hate the produckt, when I got this product I was really excited, but when I used it, I hated it. It does not have any smell to it, looks like they filled the bottle with water. I wish I can return and get my money back. since I got it, I used it twice to see after a while it might have some smell to it. Please tell me if I can return this product I will really appreciate that."
1,I didn't even receive it,"I bought this long time ago and it was supposed to arrive in a week, but they were not trackable online. And two weeks past now, I still don't have it! I want my money back!"
2,Zao - 'Z=7L' (Musea),"Originally released in 1973, as this was Zao's first lp - featuring Francois Cahen (electric piano) and Yochk'o Seffer (clarinet, sax) just after they both left Magma following the release of the band's '1,001 Degrees Centigrades' album. Personally, 'Z=7L' is WAY too experimental for me. Almost painful to sit all the way through. Mauricia Platon's clearly over-the-top dominating vocals is showcased - especially on tracks ""Marochsek"", the jazzy ""Atature"" and really out-there ""La Soupe"". If you're a Magma fan, you should obviously get more out of this CD than I did. Seriously doubt I'll seek out anymore of Zao's music."
2,the garage was better,"Listen I think what Edan is after here is a really good thing. Its sort of harks back to Dr. Octagon in a very tangential and original way. This record though stinks of too many influences. Edan's first record got him alot of attention and that attention can be felt in all the feat's. Primitive's attention was well deserved because it was so off kilter and intelligently immature. I was hoping that this record would maintain that immaturity and do what it purported to do, amplify the psychedelia of Edan's already idiosyncratic demeanor. Instead Edan seems to have moved up in the underground hip hop ranks and tends to be more boastful than thoughtful about it. Don't listen to this record until you hear his first is my recommendation. Check out Key-bored compare it to, well, anything on this record and you'll see what I meanIn the end I hope Edan takes a step back with his further endeavors."
5,Psychedelicheaddbanginggenereation,"I've been sleeping on hiphop for about 7 years now. After this break it took me 0.3 seconds to realize that only EDAN, MF DOOM, MADLIB & occasionally some other artists (check out TIME MACHINE) move me hiphop-wise.GET THIS ALBUM. WHY?? BECAUSE I TOLD YOU SO!!!"
1,Not All That,"Dont buy this CD.I dont know what all the hype is about, but boy was I fooled. The lyrics and the flow are below average, and yeah, there are some weird sounds in there, but the beats are nothing special either. I bought this, put it in my car, and within a couple songs I had to turn it off. I tried the next day, same thing. There is a lot of good underground hip-hop out there, so buy some of it instead."
5,A MASTERPIECE,"EDAN is destroying all barriers between rap, rock, metal, easy listening and every other musical genre on the planet. BEAUTY AND THE BEAT is ear candy for the new psychedelicheaddbanginggenereation. Do I like it? Yes. Almost as much as pussy."
3,Expensive for what it is,This was a disappointment. It was much smaller that I expected and the quality for the price is just not there. Big disappointment.
4,Small Cheese Plate and Knife,"I have always loved the Arthur Court Grape Series, and this is no exception. It's a small plate to serve brie or other similar cheese or rich small dessert. It looks lovely on a small breakfast table for two. Very well made, functional as well as decorative."
4,very durable toy,"The coins do get stuck in the legs like one of the reviewers says. So my 4-year-old and 2-year-old instead of putting coins in it, they both tend to ride on it. I am glad I didn't buy a ceramic piggy bank."
5,Great Looking Piggy Bank,"I'm happy with this new Piggy Bank I purchased , its a perfect size for what I need it (Im using it for saving quarters) . It looks great , came with a good packagin , came very fast and an overall opinion is that is different from others piggy banks which makes it unique and eye catching , everyone has asked me where I purchased it , Im happy with it."
1,Great way to save your money because you can't get to it,"Should have listened to reviewers - this is not for a 3 year old who likes to take money out of their bank. I thought maybe I could shove paper down in the legs to keep coins out of them, but the bigger problem is the lip around the plug opening. Coins will not slide out - very frustrating for me, can't imagine how frustrating for my 3 year old."
2,Received in damaged condition,"This item looks like it could be fun but came with 3 of 4 legs out of the wires to hold it in place in the box making me think it's a returned item passed on to me. Also has marks on head, ears, nose, that don't seem to come off and on back end of pig as well. Some kind of shiny something on side of pig as well, maybe glue? An earlier reviewer made similar comments and it makes me wonder if I received someone else's return instead of a new item. The box may be causing the marks on the pig during shipment. Not sure whether I will order a replacement and chance getting another bad one or if I will just find an alternative item."
4,"great, safe and durable....","my son loved it.. I just wishthere was a better way to get coins out of it, coins gets stuck in it. may be I will tae the head off to take coins out"
4,Ride 'em cowboy,"Bought 2 of these - one for each son. Mr6 loved it. Mr20mths thought it was a ride on toy and it was just the right height for him to demonstrate. A fun way to encourage saving...and sometimes taking coins when you least expect it!Benefit: if it drops, no smashed piggy (RIP our previous pig)"
5,Pig bank,"Liked this bank because its old school with a modern twist,looks like a cute little piggy. Nice size so the coins will add up. Made of rubber so so you don't have to worry about it breaking."
4,Great Toy,"So this piggy bank is very cute. I got it for my son's second birthday because he loves putting money in his current ceramic piggy bank, but he always wants to hold it. I figure a rubber piggy bank will be great because it is something he can put his money in, plus he gets to hold it and play with it without the worry of it shattering into a million pieces."
2,"Cute, durable, DIFFICULT","I got two for my girls, ages 4 and 2. They are cute and durable, for sure. But the legs are hollow and the coins get stuck inside! We all have the shake the pigs for minutes to get the money out."
4,Good Toy,This is one of those cute little toys with a good message about savings. I really is a good way to get the kids saving.
4,decent purchase,"I got this for my 2 yr old daughter to start learning the importance of saving a dollar and with it she has learned to pick up any coin and save. Just wish it were bigger. She use to have a big porcelin doggie until she dropped it and it broke, which is why we got this plastic one, but it was much bigger which I really liked. It does do the trick though and it's easy for her to carry so I gives this A thumb up. :)"
3,It's simply ok,"Bought this for my 5 year old daughter. The only thing that I really love is that it is plastic and not ceramic like most banks are. It is cute but I have the same complaints as the other reviewers: Hard to get money out due to it either falling in the legs or getting stuck on the inner lip and mine also came with green and brown smudges all over it. I was able to clean some of them but unfortunately not all of them. My daughter will keep her money in it so it is technically doing it's job but it is not a ""must have"" piggy bank, unless your top priority is durability."
5,This little piggy is CUTE!!,"I purchased this piggy bank as a gift for our three and half year old cousin. She wanted a piggy bank for Christmas. I looked high and low for a cute, durable piggy bank. It is simply adorable. It will be durable for a little girl to love for many years to come."
4,Schylling Rubber Piggy Bank,"When my children were young, I received a rubber piggy bank for them and over the years have lost it. I was thrilled to be able to get another rubber piggy bank for future generations. The rubber piggy banks seem to withstand calamities better than others. I will certainly keep track of this one. It has real personality!"
4,Love this pig!,"Received the pigs in very good order. Not a spot on either one of them. I bought them for a friend's twins' 1st birthday, coming up in May. They had been given two large, ceramic pigs as gifts that she will not use because they're breakable. She is going to regift them. I thought this would be the perfect piggy for the twins to ""grow into."" I did try the coin release on the belly and it is difficult . . . but if a parent has to help, so be it. Overall, I am satisified and hope they will be too. I will try the cotton balls in the legs suggestion, as it does seem as if coins will get lodged in there. I haven't deposited coins yet so don't know how that will be. May be a tad heavy for little ones, but my view, again, was to have something that they could use and enjoy for years to come, with no catastrophic accidents. Very pleased, and very pleased with Amazon."
2,Filthy,"This arrived today. The packaging (not the shipping box) was slightly beat up so I removed the piggy bank to inspect it. The bank was FILTHY. There were grease stains, black ink stains and just plain dirt all over it.I'm not sure what is happening with this sites quality but so far half of the items I've received this year have been either banged up, damaged, or dirty. I am going to have to find a new place to shop from next holiday season."
3,Hard to get coins out of.,"This piggy bank is durable and my almost 3 year old son enjoys playing with it, but the coins get stuck in the head and legs, plus there is an edge around the hole the coins are supposed to come out of, so we have to shake it a lot to get the coins out."
5,this little piggy...,"After lengthy research, this bank is the closest I could get to a toy story piggy bank of the pig known as ""Ham"" in the films- you would think they would make one that really works as a piggy bank from all those movies but only toy ones with toy money, so I was so pleased to find this one that has a similar look and not only functions great as a first piggy bank, but also is durable and adorable enough to allow for a young active boy to tote it around with him everywhere doing all those rough and tumble activities and with no worries of coins rolling out and being lost... I also can't say enough about the timely delivery! Though it had said for days that it would not arrive until Tuesday, it actually arrived three days earlier, on the previous Saturday exactly a half hour before our birthday boy's party! What a wonderful and unexpected blessing... the only way I could have been happier is if it was actually ""ham"" in the flesh..."
3,Nice sturdy piggy bank toy,"This is a sturdy vinyl piggy bank toy. I bought it to replace a ceramic one that my son dropped and it broke. But we are very happy with the finish, quality and durability of this one."
1,Received USED toy,"I am almost never unhappy about anything I receive from Amazon - but this time I had a horrible experience. The toy we received was USED. It had spots and greasy finger prints all over it - it was very obvious that it was played with by a child before. The packaging box was also torn.My child, of course, grabbed the toy anyway - I could not take it away from him to return - he was waiting for it for a week. We washed it with rubbing alcohol, but I think this is UNACCEPTABLE. Sending used toys and charge the price of NEW is NOT OK. I payed $17 just to receive a toy that was played with before and may even potentially give my child a virus. This is NOT OK.I have been a loyal custom to Amazon, but my trust in the company has shaken."
1,Can't get the money OUT!,"I bought this bank for my 3 year old daughter. She loves it--it's everything all the reviewers said, cute, durable, etc...BUT! It's VERY VERY VERY HARD to get the coins back out the bottom. There's a ""lip"" of rubber all around the edge of the opening that makes it nearly impossible to get your finger in and scoop out coins. Plus, the pig's legs are hollow. When you shake the bank to get all the coins to the bottom so you can get them out, most of them fall into the legs. It's very frustrating for her, and even I have a hard time when she asks me to fish out her money for her."
4,Nice Bank,Sturdy product. A few cotton balls stuffed into the legs prevent money from getting stuck. It did arrive with a few blue smudge marks that we haven't been able to remove.
2,Cute but disappointing,"This piggy bank is so cute, but much larger than I expected. That would be fine, but due to the hollow legs and lip on the inside of the coin hole, it is so difficult to get the coins back out. I bought it for my young son and he gets very frustrated. I try to get his money back out and I get frustrated too."
4,Piggies,"Purchased for my 4 year old nephew & 2 year old neice. They love 'em, and frequently carry them around the house, dropping them, turning them over, & generally treating them like kids that age treat everything, with no ill effects.They are larger than the pictures make them seem, and can fit a good chunk of change. Everything in the body is hollow, right down to the toes. (Not certain about the movable head.)The only issue (as others have mentioned) is the blue coloring that seems to come from the packaging onto the pigs. It does scrub off, but it'd be nicer if one didn't have to clean 'em before anyone's played with 'em."
5,"Durable, large and easy to use","I was worried after reading other reviews that I would have trouble getting coins out of this piggy, but it has a large opening at the bottom, and the slot at the top is large too. It is well made and very durable. I picked this bank out for my son so that I would not have to worry about him dropping and breaking it, and I know now I made the right choice. This will last a lifetime, undoubtedly."
5,Loved by 4 year old,The Schyllng Rubber Piggy Bank was very well received by 4 year old. Item is durable and easy for child to open plug on bottom of bank.I would purchase again for children in that age range.
4,World at War,"It's not so much racial warfare as it is caste warfare. The masters seek to reforge their crumbling empire, the warriors seek an honor-based society they can understand, the slaves rebel against everyone in their attempt to define freedom, and the nomads work on reunification... but, of course, aren't trusted by any of the others.It's old, but it's classic. While this game offers no real innovation over other period RTS systems, it has a storyline just as memorable as the early Warcraft games."
2,just bottoms. be warned.,"I'll keep this short. This product only includes the bottom of the jewel case and not the second half, the clear cover. You've been warned. I wish I had been."
3,Shelf extension can be extended,"We got this shelf to add a bit of much needed space in our rv, and it serves the purpose. Our only real disappointments were quality of the screws that came with it - grooves weren't notched deep enough on some to get a screwdriver in. The real disappointment was that the way the the folding bracket is packaged against the wood shelf, it put several grooves in the wood, though luckily didn't shred the wood. Though the shelf overall is a help, it's still rather small when added to a sink cabinet."
3,Countertop Extension - Too Small,Nice piece of wood but that is about all I can say. Ended up not fitting my counter due to fact I have overhanging counter top. Went to camping world last weekend and saw the same thing $6.00 cheaper without the outragious shipping. Live and learn. Nice for flush counters but would not recommend for overhanging counters - they should put that in advertisement.
2,Cheap,The locking arm doesn't work so I took it off and put a pole under the extension when I want to use it. Now it's much sturdier.
5,countertop extension for RV,"The motorhome is stored for the winter, looking forward to extending the kitchen workspace in a few months."
3,Not a bad read!,"I enjoyed the book especially the contritempts between Cassie Morrison and Zack Hart -- the Hart family was more than willing to accept Cassie and Billy into their family -- then Chad dropped quite a bombshell --- Love those macho cowboys --- good story but again *** before marriage -- ah, well!"
4,:),"Cassie Morrison has to deal with the grief of losing her only relative, her sister, who dies in a car accident. Now Cassie must raise her newborn nephew. Cassie discovers Chad Hart's name on Billies birth certificate and sets off to Wyoming to find him.Zach Hart, Chad's brother, does not believe that Chad is the babys father. The Harts have suffered through two incidents like this before and he has no intention of letting Cassie hurt his family. Zach's mother falls in love with Billie, her grandson, and insists that Cassie stay at the ranch until Chad can be found.Zach finds himself drawn to Cassie and starts to believe her story. Cassie knows she is asking for trouble by getting involved with Zach, but she can not seem to help herself. Cassie is also not prepared for the hurt that Zach causes her. Once Chad returns from South America, what he has to say is not what any of them expected.This is a story about the power of truth, and learning to love again."
2,for a beginner at best,I got this sander as a youth beginner and at that time I was unimpressed. If you use this type of sander very infrequently or you are buying this for a person that has a BEGINNING interest in woodworking this is the tool for you to buy. If you plan on going in any way beyond that plan on being disappointed and plan on buying a higher quality sander. I was told this same thing and didn't listen at a younger age. Oh well small price mistake I guess.
1,short life,I purchased this unit at Lowes about 6 months ago. Performed well at first. Belts started tracking to the out side of the unit if any pressure was applied to work. Then motor burned up on unit. also very loud when in use.
4,Standard James White scholarship and beyond!,A helpful comprehensive study. Includes Greek exegesis on important points. Good suggestions for further study on sections covered in the text. A great resource.
5,"This rock-solid defense of Justification should end all ""New Perspective"" nonsense","Simply put, Dr. James White is an exegetical scholar par-excellence. For any of you out there who may have been ""rattled"" by the so-called ""New-Perspective on Paul"" and are longing for a solid, one stop place to go that will explain to your mind what your heart already knows- that Sanders, Dunn and Wright are WRONG- go no further than ""The God Who Justifies."" This book will put your mind at ease. Thank God for scholars like Dr. White who are able and ready to defend the precious doctrines that give us Protestants peace and assurance of salvation by faith alone. No doctrine in the Bible (despite what N.T. Wright or any faddish scholar may say)fills the heart with such peace and than the doctrine of Justification by Faith ALONE. Thank you, Dr. White! Please keep engaging these revisionist ""scholars"" that wish to change our faith. Keep fighting the good fight, and may God bless you."
3,The God Who Justifies,"We are using this book for our church's Men's Theology class. The first part of the book is very interesting and thorough. Great treatment of the subject. Starting about half way through, the author uses a significant amount of Greek to go more in depth. Unfortunately, unless you are a student of the Greek language, it makes the book significantly more difficult to read. We just started the Theology class and our instructor will get us through it, but it could be tough for new believers or those without any knowledge of the Greek."
3,"Not amazing, but OK","I have had these for about 4 months and I regret buying them.The bad- The foam is extremely uncomfortable and they are a bear to have on for more than an hour. Sure, they look bad a&% in the pics but they really aren't. They are also a full (thick) plastic frame instead of a rubber-like material used in better googles.The good- The vents provide good air in hot conditions. The lenses do not fog and they clean easy.Overall- Not a good buy. Save your money and get flex-8s, e-vents, or profilers."
3,Protects your face for cheap,"I bought this mask for my first time paintballing because I didn't want to wear the smelly rental mask, and it's definitely a step up from the rental mask, but the foam gets uncomfortable after a while, it doesn't breathe all that well, and the lenses get dirty pretty easily. I would only recommend this mask if it's your first time playing and you don't want to use the smelly rental masks."
4,GREAT,its a good mask for da price it doesnt fog up the cusioning is alittle scratchy but its an all around great deal buy it!!!
5,Great Speakers,I replaced the midrange/woofers in my center channel speaker box with these. I was amazed at how efficient they were compared to the original speakers. Very clean and crisp sound with no artifacts.I would recommend these to anyone needing a great compact midrange/woofer.Packaging was excellent and delivery prompt.
4,Looks great,"Looks great, easy to install. Hard to believe that it is super energy efficient without some kind of foam type gasket between the ceiling and the product, but I am no expert."
3,liquid liquid,"its a good product and a lot of bikers live by it,but its the name that your paying for.you can get another brand cheaper get it....."
1,biggest waste of money,"The Mosquito Magnet Pro is the biggest waste of money i have ever encountered. I spent over $1300 and it worked (actually pretty well) one summer. I contacted American Biophysics and they could offer little support on the phone, and basically told me i would need to take it apart, send it to them, and for $450 i would get it fixed. (or they would be glad to sell me a lower-end model for the same $450).This is one of those things where I have ""chosen"" my battle, and it will go out in the trash, or become a really ugly plant holder. (probably trash so i dont have to see it again)STAY AWAY"
3,Does not work on natural gas,"I bought the Pro model about two years ago. Unlike the other reviewers, mine has worked fine. In fact it does an amazing job of killing flying biting insects. My ONE BIG complaint is that it cannot be used with natural gas. I have the BBQ piped into the house but still every couple of weeks I'm getting my propane tank refilled for the Mosquito Magnet. If and when somebody sells one of these things that can work on natural gas, I'll throw this one away and buy it."
2,"does kill mosquitos, but hard to keep running","It would appear that American Biophysics needed to do a better engineering job. My unit started and ran smoothly through the first propane tank. When it came time to replace the tank, however, I was unable to get the unit to keep running after it started. This became a time-consuming endeavor, trying different propane tanks, repeatedly trying to reset the tanks, using the CO2 cartidges, etc. The people at the propane company, who purged my (second) new tank, seemed to have heard a lot of stories similar to mine. The company did agree to replace my unit with a new one."
1,"Great, while it works...","Purchased a MM Pro in the summer of 2000. Worked great for two years, then in July of 2002, it wouldn`t stay on. Called customer service a few times, did everything they told me to, but eventually they sent me a new power unit under warranty. That lasted a little more than one year; in 2003, we started having problems with it again. Called customer service today (July 5, 2004 -- no wait for service rep). Did what they asked. Appears that the muffin fan is dead. Asked about replacing it -- they don`t have any parts information. Not under warranty, must replace head for $350 (and get 6 months warranty on it) or ""upgrade"" to Pro 2004 for $600 (and get 2 years). I asked them about reliability -- they said the new Pro is more reliable; don`t know if I want to spend $600 to find out.While it runs, it does catch a lot of mosquitoes, but when it breaks, it's an expensive lawn ornament. These guys need to admit they have/had problems with their units and replace the defective ones."
2,Mosquito Magnet needs help!!,"I bought this product when I moved to Miami from Atlanta. My parents had one in Atlanta and it worked somewhat well, but in Miami I have been unable to control the Mosquito's. Another problem with the machine is every three to four weeks you have to replace the bait and the propane. It would be nice if they could design the system to only need propane and bait every quarter. I have never had any problems with the operation of the machine."
2,A Minor Disappointment,"While you can never go wrong listening to Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin or Sammy Davis, Jr., this particular CD is misleading in it's title. This is not a usual ""Rat Pack"" compilation with witty banter and outtakes. Instead it is composed of very old Sinatra songs (probably recorded in the 40's), some very early Dean Martin interspersed with cuts by Sammy Davis, Jr. which were recorded in front of a live audience. On the whole, I was disappointed with the CD even though I am a devoted Sinatra fan."
3,Lonely in Japan as a White Guy,"I would hardly call this song racist. I think its just a lonely struggling white artist who was stuck in japan and out of his element. It might offend asians, but hey everyones got a song nowadays out there that offends someone.Im sure if your played a madonna song in church someone would be offended or likewise if you played a newsboys song in a public schools someone would be offended.America needs to take a chill pill."
3,Buy Vaporized instead...,"Don't get me wrong - the Vapors rock, but I picked this CD up over here coz I needed a Vapors fix and my vinyl is at home (and the Vapors *are* better on vinyl) - and I guess the different song order ruined all the tracks on New Clear Days for me - it was better in the original. Also, you get all of Magnets with the other one - anly most on this one. You get a bonus live track, but it's not worth the price of admission."
3,Turning Japanese is NOT a Racist statement,"People keep claiming that this song, for which The Vapors will forever be known, is a racist statement. ""Turning Japanese"" is a euphimism for masturbatory activity. Think about the lyrics... he's sitting alone, with a picture of his girlfriend. He misses her, he starts to .. uh .. i don't need to go into details, but picture your eyes while involved in such an activity... you sort of have a closed eye squinty thing going... thus ""Turning Japanese"""
3,Nothing wrong but not the right version,"I bought this score to study for an exam. Then when reading the section of the ""Russian Dance,"" I heard the orchestration much richer and transparent from the recording than it is on the score. It turns out that there is a revised version of this work by Stravinsky himself in 1947. I listened to couple recordings on Naxos music library and pretty sure that most of the recordings play the revised version published by Bossey & HawkesPetrouchka: Score (Boosey & Hawkes Masterworks Library). The instrumentation of the revised version is smaller and its orchestration has lots more details, such as articulations and economic uses of the textures. The revised version has different rehearsal numbers and extra arrangement for the ending. Just be careful about which version you are looking for."
5,Hell Bent for Leather,"Definitely one of the best Priest albums ever to blast through the sound systems of the world. No fillers at all and every song is a definition of heavy metal. The record is one of my favourite cds and it contains essential classics like the immortal title track(which cannot be left out of the band's live setlist) or ""Running Wild""."
4,"Les Binks, the best!!","Les Binks was the best drummer Judas Priest ever had and, unfortunately, he recorded just two studio albums with them: STAINED CLASS and HELL BENT FOR LEATHER. TO check his astonishing ability, go for UNLEASHED IN THE EAST (PRIEST IN THE EAST)."
4,JUDAS !!!!! JUDAS !!!! JUDAS !!!!,"THe good old days... THis album is classic, as all albuns up until SCREAMING FOR VENGEANCE are. After that, the decline began (even if DEFENDERS OF THE FAITH has some good tracks here. Les Binks is the drummer here, don't know why he left. Dave Holland was good, but not in the same category. Anyway, the title track is a killer, everything shines here. BEFORE The DAWN is also great, different. A lesson in metal."
4,Best Judas Priest studio album. (period!),"If you like JP, and don't have this one, buy it, it's their best. (Excepting the live CD ""Unleashed In The East"", which is even better!)"
5,A Classic!,"With songs like ""Hell Bent for Leather and The Green Manalishi with the 2 pronged Crown"" pretty much sums up this CD as an instant classic Priest album."
4,"Questionable production, but powerful metal tunes","While Hell Bent For Leather is not the masterpiece that Sad Wings of Destiny or Stained Class remains, it is still a highly worthy addition to one's Priest (or metal in general) collection. The production is less than stellar (at least they never worked with James Guthrie again, or did they?), but most of the tunes practically define unhypenated metal. ""Delivering The Goods,"" ""Hell Bent for Leather,"" ""Killing Machine,"" and ""Running Wild"" are among the band's best, for sure. While ""Take on the World"" is a somewhat generic anthem, ""The Green Manalishi"" is somewhat overrated, and ""Burnin' Up"" loses its impact about three-quarters of the way through, the Priest remains one of the greatest forces in metal ever. So crank it up and ""Rock, rock, rock, forr-evahhh!"""
3,Remastered Sound? Yeah Right...,"Still this is a metal classic. The bonus tracks are weak and the remastering minimal at best.Personally it's difficult for me to listen to Halford sing ""Burnin' Up"" since he came out of the closet. The lyrics make me wince. Hey, but that's just me."
5,Delivering the Goods,"This album established Priest's leather and studs look. From that point on, it has been the most imitated style in metal. I think this album goes toe to toe with any other Priest material. It just RULES!!"
2,Delivering the Bads,"Why did it say ""best of the artist"" back on the ""cdnow"" site?Not the best release ever. This is dissapointing!"
4,IT MAKES NO SENSE ...,"I agree with some reviewers that say this album is a little bit weaker than STAINED CLASS. But you forgot one point: everything Priest released before they sold out in the middle eighties achieved classic status, including ""HELL BENT FOR LETAHER""."
2,I'LL KEEP THIS SHORT...,"THE AUDIO FIDELITY GOLD VERSION STINKS...IT IS OVERRATED AND NO BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL 1970's RELEASE!Save your money and buy the 2001 British ""Remasters"" version...- JUDAS PRIEST & HEAVY METAL FOREVER!"
2,Overrated,"When I read all of the reviews about ""the best album ever"" and stuff like that I expected an awesome LP. What I got was a mediocre rap album. The beats are pretty repetitive and most are...well...weak. No doubt these two are great MCs, but you can only listen to the same lame beat for a little while. Noreaga's NORE is definitely a better buy if you want to try some of his stuff."
4,it's obvious how these dues put N.Y. on the map again,I'm not a big fan of the NY style or sound how ever there are talents that have made my head turn these cats were one of those groups that made me wanna listen to more although its a shame that when they came out it was when the media declared that hip-hop was having a civil war when in reality it was just another Beef in hip-hop between record labels not coasts but beside that dark chapter these cats have an original & smooth flow but very N.Y. style so it was worth the purchase
4,Gangsta stuff,"This is some real gangsta S***, i like it very, very much but there is still some tracks that is boring, thats why i give four star's,Thats gangsta"
3,Pretty Good,This album is pretty good. The beats kick and the answer to NY is a true statement that NY run hip-hop.
5,This group is one of the best underground rugged type rap.,"The songs are definately extremly livly and ""Thugged Out"" as NORE would put it. The blazin duo and of course their little helper Tragedy. Who produced most of the tape really out did themselves and topped all that want to be thug junk out there. This is real straight up illegal life. Songs such as Bloody Money, T.O.N.Y. , are instant out of the case classics for any Noreaga or straight thug rap lover out there cop it. PiT and BiG L."
5,THE HOTTEST ALBUM EVER!!!!!!!,YO THIS IS THE HOTTEST ALBUM OUT EVER. I LOVED IT SO MUCH I HAD TO BUY A CD AND TAPE. IF U DON'T GOT IT GO GET IT RIGHT NOW. AND THE REUNION IS GONNA BURN UP THE CHARTS. YO THESE CATS ARE FOR REAL. T.O.N.Y
2,A continuation of the original Rich Dad Poor Dad,"I loved the first Rich Dad Poor Dad book (I would give it 5 stars)! This one covers the Cashflow Quadrant (just as the title suggest) in slightly more detail than the first. While I realize redundancy is a key to driving in new ideas & making things happen naturally that don't normally, I believe this book could have been reduced to two chapters. I do not want to discourage anyone from reading it but I would suggest checking it out at the library instead of buying it. I don't believe I will need to own this book for later review."
5,Simply the best financial book I've EVER read!,"At the age of nine, I read ""Think and Grow Rich."" Since then, I've read MANY books on finances. But only this one has actually changed my life. Wow! Now, in my humble opinion, this work could have been written slightly more concisely. The content seems to become redundant near the end of the first third of the book. However, three-fifths of the way through, the pace picks up again and continues to escalate all the way to the end. Having said that, the actual information contained in this book is priceless and peerless. It's changed my entire way of thinking about life. I repeat ""LIFE!"" I'm an African-American and this book has shed a whole new light on how to abolish racism. Mr. Kiyosaki's financial ""philosophy,"" if you will, implies a multiplicity of ramifications. If you have ever felt that college left you unprepared for the REAL world, read this book and you will understand precisely why. Invest in your future. Invest in your freedom. Buy this book!"
1,Misses the mark,"If you want to become rich, this is not the book for you. Any of the Motley Fool books (""You have More than You Think"" is the one I bought, but you can get most of the good stuff for free at the Motley Fool site) and ""The Millionaire Next Door"" are far better choices. Mr. Kiyosaki claims to be ""retired"" in his mid-40s, but he still seems to be trying awfuly hard to make money but peddling this simplistic, repetitive book."
5,Excellent book for cashflow,I have to say that if you want to get out of the rat race you need to understand how cash flow works. This book will change the way you think about money - your money. I couldn't recommend this book higher for everyone who is tired of working hard and tired of not being wealthy. I also recommend Stop Working by Rohan Hall. This book teaches you how to build a cash flow based Agile business. Buy both of these books and learn how to become financially independent.
4,Find the Diamonds hidden in the rough,Hidden between his strong upsell to his $300 board game and his 'you can do it too' motivational talk are some very good insights into the fiancial mind.By far the best concept is Kiyosaki's cash flow quadrant - where do you lie on it and what does that mean for how you've been thinking about leveraging your talents? Also hidden throughout are other pieces of sage advice about the skills and traits needed to become financially adept.Be picky as to what you take from this book and you'll enjoy it very much.
4,More Rich Dad Poor Dad,"This book is a continuation of the first book, ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad."" Some of the material is repetitive. This is not a problem as it goes deeper into cash flow concepts. The book does not give any simple answers and does not give the reader a blueprint or recipe to success. However, the book is superb at assisting the reader in thinking about money in a healthy way. The reader is given the concept in having money work for the reader, rather than just working for money. You can work hard to put money to work rather than just working to get money to spend on wasting assets."
5,Cash Flow Quadrant,I've received the book in Brazil earlier than estimated by Amazon.Thanks again Amazon for the promptness and effectiveness :-)
5,Rich Dad's CASHFLOW quadrant,"This book is simply awesome. Robert explains in simple words how money flows and should be a must for everyone's financial education.I highly recommend it to everyone I work with, to better their financial life."
4,Eye Opening,"Bottom line explained in Rich Dad / Poor Dad is : Assets feed you, Liabilities eat you.Once we move beyond this basic principle, it is eye opening how much we lose to all trashy taxes, and unnecessary 'doodads' because we don't operate with financial intelligence.Taking the approach in this book, I found $20K per year which I was gladly throwing out in the trash previously, without realizing it.The book does not get detailed enough into the various corporate structures, and what benefits each affords in terms of asset protection, which is about the only drawback.A really great book, once you have read Rich Dad Poor Dad.This book should be required reading for high school graduation."
3,"Interesting Points, but long repetitive","I really found the ideas behind the cashflow quadrant interesting. However, I think it could have been done in half the pages or less. The book spent a lot of time re-explaining the same ideas that were in Rich Dad, Poor Dad (build assets and lower liabilities) over and over again. After about 70 pages of it, I got tired and started to skim the rest of the book. I felt really bad about that because I occasionally found some really interesting points interlaced between the repetitive stuff. I really enjoyed ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" and was looking for some hard lined advice about how to begin my quest for financial independance. Instead, the book was still largely a rehash of the same info. I'm going to return it... Unfortunate... :( It's worth noting, however, that Kiyosaki does mention several other books to read about becoming financially independant. I think I will check those out..."
2,Rich Dad - Poor Dad with a New Cover,"Everything in Rich Dad, Poor Dad is in this book. I found the first book to be far more engaging and unique.Cashflow Quadrant is a creative re-hashing of the first in the series. If you have not read the first book, you will find Kiyosaki's second text interesting."
1,dissapointing,fluff & filler - same info as found in RDPD & RD's guide to investing but with about 125 pages of worthless rambling.
1,Pure Fluff,"I loved the original ""Rich Dad / Poor Dad"" and since this was billed as ""Part 2"" I had high hopes that it would be just as entertaining and enlightening. Well, it's obvious that the author and publishers just wanted to scramble to get something out there before the ""Rich Dad"" enthusiasm died down. Aside from a few (very few) useful and engaging stories, like the one about the ""quaint little village"" with a water problem, this book is just one long, boring, repetitious slog. There is a vignette in the introduction about a brief period of homelessness that the author and his wife endured in their ""brown Toyota"" that I thought was really interesting and should have been, and could have been, expanded upon. But if I had a dime for every time the author repeated something he had just covered a few pages before, then I would be as rich as the author himself. Save yourself!"
4,PRETTY GOOD OVERALL!,"All in all, the book was pretty good, although many have stated that he was really redundant (i have to agree).I must say that he presented his ideas in an extremely relatable manner which made the the book easy to read and hard to put down. Without his real life examples it would sound too good to be true.He did regurgitate much of the text time and time again (about the only drawback). I haven't yet but will purchase the book because I think it will be a good reference guide for both motivation and a FEW investment options.Oh, and last but not least, does anyone know how to get a hold of this ""Cashflow"" board game he swears by!?!"
5,On the road to freedom,"This book has opened my eyes about the world we live in today. The way Robert describes the different quadrants and how each person participates in each one is an eye opener. My mind has been opened with this book to pursue more knowledge down the path to financial freedom. You will not get alot of nuts and bolts about a path in this book, but it does a great job on putting your mind on the right track with the knowledge we need. Highly recommended!"
4,Interesting read,"I really liked this book. It is an accurate assessment of how most of us ""live to work"" as opposed to ""work to live."" It's interesting to note that most of us are so busy working for others that we don't have time to step back and make an assessment of where we are and where we're heading. I highly recommend this book to everyone. I wish I had read this 10-15 years ago. It would have helped me by opening my eyes to what's really going on. I have taken some steps to adjust my habits and thinking, because of this book. I have started talking to financial professionals in getting a handle on my financial and investment strategies and looking at generating income differently. I also looked at the CASHFLOW game and considered buying it...but unfortunately, the price is too high. ... END"
4,Not a connect the dots book,"I was given this book as a gift by a close friend who is interested in personal finance (actually, he's a financial advisor), and in fact, it sat on my bookshelf for close to a year before I cracked it open. I've read a lot of other personal finance books, but I enjoyed this one so much that, after finishing it, ordered Kiyosaki's other two books in the series, ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"", and ""Rich Dad's Guide to Investing"". I equally enjoyed those. It is not a road map to get from point A to point B. Rather, it is food for thought, and for thoughtful people, should provide some ideas and inspiration in building and creating their own version of a dream. Anyhow, even if you don't agree 100% with what he says, most people will still find it inspiring and likely useful."
2,Rich Dad Part 2,"Though there are some valid concepts outlined, like the E/B/S/I descriptions, I would approach with caution as the author is a HUGE fan of ""Network Marketing"" and mentions it in the book as an important business tool. This is most likely because of the his close involvement Amway/Quixitar. Amway is a Multi Level Marketer, and sells products such as Mary Kay cosmetics and Glister toothpaste through direct sales representatives. Would you trust someone so enthralled of controversial business practices and pyramid-like schemes?"
2,"Lots of words, no content","I really liked the first book, but this one was a waste. He doesn't say anything that wasn't in the first volume. This is just words and more words about pretty much nothing."
3,good reading,"good concepts...not so sure how easy it is to find properties like the ones desirable..,.financing through banks in real estate with little equity? could be purple kool aid..."
4,Finding My Path To Financial Freedom,"This book really helped me to see where I have been, where I am currently, and where I want to go when it comes to financial freedom. It put words, numbers and a formula to what I have felt for many years but have been unable to clearly articulate. This is a great read for anyone who wants a clear start to a plan for getting out of debt and choosing financial freedom as opposed to just security."
3,"Ok book, not great.","I had a friend recommend this book to me and I was very excited to read it. Unfortunately the book had a very hard time holding my attention. I did get some good information out of the book and so I can't complain about it too much, but it was just very hard to read. I'm a big fan of the author, but this book was NOT written well and definately was not his best. I honestly can't recomend this one."
3,Financial Freedom? - a little overstated,"Although this book is treading on what can be very difficult for someone who has never had any experience in finances to to understand, I really did not glean a lot from it except the definitions of the ""cashflow"" quadrant and where I should go within that quadrant. There were some interesting little maxims and proverb-type-things, but it really didn't have a whole lot of ""nuts and bolts"" type of info that I like, but I do have a profession in investments. I think you have to read (all 25 books is it now?) in order to figure out what rich dad's cashflow quadrant is....books maybe? There is just too much hype around these books and I am a little dissappointed. All around probably worth reading from the library or something.**Read something by Peter J. Daniels those books will actually help you change you life. www.peterdanielsonline.com**"
2,A very simplisitc presentation of the obvious,"This book did not tell me anything that I did not already know. As for how the the author made his fortune, the financial data was too sparse to gain any knowledge from. For example the author found a property worth $100,000, but was able to buy it for $80,000. Was it really worth $100,000? The author sold it on a wraparound lease and made money, he said. The cash flow discussion did not reveal how it played out. It would have been interesting to see how the income taxes and depreciation worked. I don't believe that the profit on that venture in the long was significant. Moreover, the author and his wife were broke and living free with someone else. Where did they get $10,000 to start buying the property they invested in? Pop's money? I would like to see the run out of their return on investments.It was never shown in detail."
1,About 5 pages of information spread over 250 pages,"His basic idea that you should be an investor or business owner rather than an employee or self-employed was repeated over and over. While I agree with that idea, there is very litle more here.I bought this book because some of the other reviews here made it sound very worthwhile. I was misled. If there was a money back offer on this book, I would take advantage of it.There are many other books on how to get rich, and I would suggest you try some of the others first."
3,"This book is a distant second to the original ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad""","""Cashflow quadrant"" shares good concepts and ideas that do indeed build on the basics discussed in ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad,"" but I found the writing to be fairly simplistic and repititive. The 7 steps to getting started, which are the last 50 pages of the book or so are what I found to be the most valuable as they help to create an action plan. They make some of the vague concepts much more tangible for me. If you only read the first chapter to understand the various quadrants where people make money and the last 50 pages, you could skip the middle 175 pages while still gaining the majority of the book's value. Generally speaking, I would not recommend buying this book, but rather skimming the beginning and end in a book store. It's a 250 page book that could easily be about 50 pages while minimizing the repetition of the same points over and over."
5,"Great follow up to ""Rich Dad Poor Dad""","This book is a fantastic sequel to ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"". While the first Rich Dad book laid a great foundation and provided some high level direction, this book took what I had learned and added to it. There are some repeat ""lessons"" but they tend to go more in depth and have different examples that help me have a better understanding of the concept. In one of the books RTK uses an example of the financial education that you need to be financially free and compares it to the foundation of a building. These books are helping me lay that strong foundation.As a side note, I listened to the audio CD version of this book and the only things I didn't like were the speakers voice (very robot-sounding) and the fact that every time he mentioned a particular quadrant, he had to say both the letter and name of the quadrant... this got a bit tiresome and a bit Sesame Street sounding (ie ""B, Business"", ""I, Investor"")."
5,A PRICELESS Education,"Want to know why the rich get richer and everyone else seems to struggle? Is this an end all on the subject- NO it is not, as Robert himself would tell you the study of money if a lifetime pursuit.However this book does an excellent job of describing the basics of why the rich get richer- and how they do it.This book is also the first that enabled me to understand some basic accounting principles- mostly by not using numbers and formulas just some simple diagrams. Does it make you a CPA- No. But it does get a working class guy with little to no accounting knowledge the basic understanding of a personal financial statement.Robert Kiyosaki (and his advisors) write books that make what seems to be complex money subjects seem understandable. Kind of the way AOL made the internet seem easy. Most of us have outgrown AOL a LONG, LONG time ago. And you can improve your financial literacy easily with Robert and his team."
2,"Not as good as Rich Dad, Poor Dad 1.","I really enjoyed 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad', so I picked up a copy of Cashflow Quadrant right away. But I found this follow up to 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad' had just way too much filler. This book keeps pounding the same statements over and over. I know this was also done in Rich Dad, Poor Dad, but this time it was overkill. The motivational messages started to wear thin when you can see that it was just to fill up a page. There is also something very contradicting I found between the first and second book. In 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad' he said that owning a business is very hard and he dosen't recommend anyone starting one unless they truly desire to have one. Then In 'Cashflow Quandrant', he says that you should own a business first before moving into the I quandrant to invest in stocks and real estate. Uhhh.....hello? These are the reasons why I'm giving it only 2 stars. If you already read 'Rich Dad, Poor Dad', then you don't need to read Cashflow Quadrant."
5,Excellent book,"I really recommend this book, if the first one was good, this is VERY GOOD, get into more details about how to obtain the financial freedom."
1,False Prophet,"Do not rely upon this book for your financial future. Robert Kiyosaki does not preach sound principles of finance and is a highly paid spokesperson for Amway, hence his recommendation of MLM-type business as a wise pursuit. His ""rich Dad"" is a fictional character, and he feels he has not mislead anyone to follow a fictional financial success story anymore than Rowling has deceived anyone by creating Harry Potter. However, few people really expect to attend Hogwarts, whereas all too many people expect to find financial success by emulating fictional ""Rich Dad""."
5,Awakening for all Self employ thinking they are in Business.,"A very frightening book.For those who are self employ after reading the book it was real frightening to realise, infact you have create a job for youself instead of running a business. A must read for those who are running a ""business' You need to understand exactly where you are in the Quartrant.Are you on the left or right side of the quartrant. Strongly recommend to those who has being sucessfully being self employ all these while and need to move on."
2,"Rich author, Poor reader","Robert Kiyosaki sure made himself very rich - his books are selling like hotcakes. It is easy to capitalise on people's desire to grow rich. Book 2 is nothing much more than a repackaging of the ideas presented in Book 1. Again, the content is irritatingly repetitive and lacks substance. Its effect is comparable to the best sleeping pills. Why did I read this book? The answer is simple: I want to give the author a second chance to convince me. I have been disappointed. If you enjoy reading common sense, go buy it. Otherwise, save your money for something more productive. I didn't fall prey, the copy I read was borrowed from someone."
4,Simple Guide ...,An easy read to understanding and classifying the cashflow on the types of people in the different quadrants. Subtle but important differences in the quadrants are mentioned. I will definitely recommend it to anyone who is willing to make a change in their mindset on how to manage their finances.
5,Cashflow Quadrant,"This book was simple, and I gained a great deal of knowledge regarding the investing world and how it relates to my every-day finances. Kiyosaki has a gift for teaching, and I have enjoyed and benefited from every one of his books I have read. Also extremely beneficial to me was Scot Anderson's book, Think Like a Billionaire, Become a Billionaire, a fantastic book, for anyone who will, on the practicals from A to Z on gaining wealth."
2,Mostly a waste of time,"I read Rich Dad Poor Dad and didn't like it because it was very fluffy - no details, just hand-waving. This book was at least as fluffy as Rich Dad Poor Dad...maybe fluffier.The one good piece of advice I took away from this book (and it was probably plagiarized) was a sound numerical strategy for extricating one's self from consumer debt. If you want to read it, go to a bookstore read the last chapter or two, kindly place the book back on the shelf, and save yourself $15."
3,Not exactly the first,"Cashflow Quadrant has many great concepts and has helped me decide which quadrant I want to generate my income from. The problem is that the book is poorly written and at times repetative. At times I found myself looking back at the beginning of the chapter to see what that chapter was supposed to be about. I also found ideas/concepts repeated in different sections of the book.Not as good as Rich Dad,Poor Dad yet I still recommend the book for its useful content."
1,Don't waste your time,"I don't believe Robert Kiyosaki or anything he writes. He is just another financial guru who is making all his money off of selling you his books, not his skill in business."
5,Very Informative And A Highly Recommended Reading For EVERYONE,"This one book from Robert T. Kiyosaki really opened my mind and eyes, I will have to read it again & yet again to really get a complete understanding of the Information he has in this book, And anyone that says reading it once is enough, READ It again and you will be surprised at what pops up out of the pages as do read this book. So If you are truely tired of the old RAT RACE and feel there is got to be a better way then read this book."
1,Negative 10,Where is David Horiwitz when you need him?!? The Robert Kiyosaki books are WASTE of MONEY and TIME. Don't buy them.
2,"OK if you are a beginner, but....","...if you have moved beyond the novice level, have some personal finance knowledge, have your own business, or even have done your own federal taxes (the long form), this is probably too basic for your needs. Interesting graphical treatments of the concepts. If you are a personal finance beginner, give it a try."
3,"Average, but you'll probably buy it anyway","In this second guide, Kiyosaki introduces four classifications of people based on how they earn income. These classifications form the quadrant for which the book is named. People ""on the left side"" of the quadrant earn income directly from their own labour. Those on the right side earn income through others' labour. This book discusses the steps to take in order to move oneself from the left to the right side of the quadrant, particularly to the classification based around earning income from investing where the greatest potential income streams can be found at the lowest risk. Kiyoski seeks to help people understand themselves better, and through this understanding improve themselves to eventually control their personal financial situations."
2,"Poor book, Rich Author","This book was one big infomercial for his board game. Moreover, it was nothing more than a poorly edited and designed autobiography (the horrbile design distracts one's eye). Yes, there was small snipets of information that were ""helpful,"" but not 190 pages worth. Might as well have watched this at 11:30 pm on a Tuesday night; I would ahve got the same out of it. Look for something more enriching."
1,This book is for dreamers,"I found some insightful comments in Rich Dad, Poor Dad, so I thought I'd give this book a try. What a mistake!I am now convinced that the author has made the shallow deduction that a rich dad was also wiser because he ended up rich. It sounds to me like the rich dad was luckier and that the author is full of hot air. The author goads us unto the idea that starting business systems run by people we hire (instead of ourselves) is the only way to really get rich. That's the whole book in a nutshell. There is nothing more concrete inside the cover."
4,Hard to choose,The author write it with very few words. This book is a real inspiration for everyone. But when you really making decision according to the writer. It will be very hard.
5,This book is definitely worth than 14 bucks!,"Mark my words, Reading this book is definietly for your life definitely than one 30 bucks dinner."
2,Hint: Kiyosaki is making a lot of money from his books.,"Nothing much here to recommend it. At its best, the book provides a unique perspective on the American spendthrift. At its worst, it wallows in a repulsive adaptation of the Protestant work ethic: there's a higher power out there who wants you - yes, YOU - to be rich."
3,when is it going to end?,"Good info, but said over and over and over again. This book could have been 2 chapters."
2,Nothing specific,"I agree with the readers, who said that this book does not offer specific advice. I like the logic, that you should not overspend and earn before spending. But how can we start? Does he suggest to move in a trailer as he did? Or bring my family to live in the basement f our friends? He says that the house is a liability even if the mortgage is paid. OK, what should we do? Pay the same money as rent? Or invest in real estate, rent it and live in a broken car, so that not to pay taxes? This is an example of the specific advice I believe is missing. I don't want to offend anybody, but many people who rated highely this book are still in college and do not have a sense of what the real life is. This book is just for starters, to get the idea of not going into too much debt and think about investing. It is nothing more."
4,Good educational book,"Great Book for people willing to change their minds enough to follow guidance. Not a ""how to"" book. People looking for someone to tell them how to get rich should not read this. Those willing to make the change should definitely read this book before plunging ahead with any course of action."
5,"Financial Freedom, Part II","After I read Rich Dad Poor Dad, I HAD to get this book, and I wasn't disappointed!! Kiyosaki explains the 4 categories that working people fall into, then explains the mind-set that pervades each category.If you're serious about becoming financially free, then this book is an ESSENTIAL addition to your library.You won't be disappointed."
5,Cashflow quadrant,"have recieved this book in new condition, another great book by Robert Kyosaki, will be returning to purchase another Robert Kyosaki book"
5,Good book,"Great read and great information. Robert Kyosaki should be treasurer or something. Pick it up, read it and benefit from the practices."
3,Repetitive . . . yes,"Like others, I do agree this book is a little repetitive. Mr. Kiyosaki does restate the same ideas he mentioned in his first book but he goes into more detail on other ideas; like how he made money on some deals. This book is meant to be a general 'coaching' and not a get rich quick seminar. So the repetitive pep talks are necessary and probably are similar in method to which his rich dad gave him. Furthermore, after a lifetime of repeating bad money habits, one needs repetition before correcting those habits. I do plan on continuing the series."
5,Read This book,"This is Kiyosaki's second book in the Rich Dad, Poor Dad series and builds on his simple but wise quadrant. Basically,, he divides income producing activities into employee, self-employed, investor, and business owner. Kiyosaki goes on to discuss how taxes impact your income in each quadrant, and recommends you find ways to move into the business owner and investor blocks. this information is vital to creating wealth and is rock-solid advice.Two other books you may want to read on this subject include ""The Richest Man in Babylon,"" by George Clason, and ""The 17 Principles of Creating Wealth,"" by Phillip Collinsworth."
5,Like this brand,I tried this brand for the first time last month and I really liked it. Having never taken a COQ10 supplement before I did some research online and found out this was the company that they used in studies. So I tried the 200 mg ones and I noticed such an improvement in my mood and my palpitations went away after a few days. I am gonna try the 100 mg dosage and take it once in the morning and once in the evening and see if they have as good as effect as the once a day 200 mg. I sure hope so because I loved the way they made me feel. I like the fact that they are chewable too.
3,I wiiiish these tasted a little better,"I purchased these, hoping for a little treat with my enormous vitamin regimen. These, to me, just tasted slightly yummy, not a whole lot of yumminess. They kind of tasted like dry chalky brownie mix from a box. ...Buuuut, my nutritionist INSISTS that this brand is the highest quality. I will continue taking them until they are gone."
3,SAMSON WAS BLACK!,"If you read Pine Hollow #4, Samson comes back because the person max sold him to, died in a boat accident, and Carole was training him. They said he was black like 50 times. But i didn't like #4, because Carole gets so attatched to Samson that she ignores poor starlight. Also, In that book, whats going on with prancer?? Lisa can't ride her anymore. I think it's because they're going to breed prancer. I can't wait till #5 comes out!! You should read that book, it gives you great guidelines."
2,"Good tunes, poor recording quality","This is a CD to be listened to from at least one room away. The quality of the recording is probably one of the worst I've ever heard at close range, but doesn't sound so bad with distance. There is a continuous ""scratchy"" sound, especially during trumpet melodies, and percussion and piano both sound dull. This might be an attempt to duplicate the sound of vinyl, or it might be that this CD was ripped from records, but in any case, it sounds like crud. Too bad, since the songs on the CD could be really good."
4,Not just for puppies...,"Although the product can be a bit pricey, it can be worth it. I put a Kong liver snap treat (KONG Stuff'N Snacks, Liver, 11-Ounce, Large) in the Kong (KONG Classic Kong Dog Toy, Large, Red) first, then ""anchor"" it with the liver paste. I stick the whole thing in the freezer for a few hours to a few weeks, until I want to give it to my dog. Freezing makes it last 20-30 minutes instead of the 20-30 seconds it would take her to empty the Kong if it wasn't frozen.She is terrified of thunderstorms, and will keep us up with pacing, barking, howling and whining if not distracted. This stuff will distract her from ANYTHING. Then I can sleep...ZZZzzzzzzzz........."
2,Only giving this 2 stars for ease of use,This paste gave BOTH my dogs diarrhea each time I used it. It's also got disgusting fillers. The price is WAY too high for how little use you get out of each can. Just buy a large peanut butter or cream cheese or throw left over chicken in the Kong and freeze it. Why pay this if you can get 20x the use out of a jar of peanut butter? I only caved because I had been curious for months AND it went on sale.
3,Liver Paste - pretty runny,"Although my dogs love the taste of this stuff, it's a little runny and tends to flow out of the grooves after I squirt it on groovie-bones, etc. The Peanut Butter Stuff'n Paste is thicker and works better."
4,Great little book on leadership,"This is a brief read on leadership. He highlights a few characteristics of leadership. The book is not a paradigm shifting book, but is a quick reminder of the need for futuristic leadership. Andy is a leader and a clear communicator. If you are looking for some easy advice on improving your leadership skills, this is a good book for you. You will be rewarded for your investment."
5,Very powerful and inspirational,"""If you are looking for a book to challenge you as a leader in this day and time, this is the one you need. Andy Stanley takes you on a journey that will embolden you to be a leader of courage."""
2,Too basic...,"I found the book a little too basic and 'borrowed' concepts from many other practical leadership books. I also seemed to think Mr. Stanley was WAY to into talking about his mega-church. Not to mention the dust-cover is the trashiest looking attention getter.Instead, try reading Hybels or even better, Stephen Covey."
5,Excellent,"Being a leader in this age is very difficult. Morality goes a long way. Then you add integrity and it becomes even tougher,but we as Christians do not have a choice for our invisible GOD expects us to be obedient to him. To lead others to Christ we must maintain integrity and morality. In other words lead by example."
5,Challenging. Will take you to the next level.,I like anything Andy Stanley writes but I think this one has become my favorite so far. Poses great questions and he always is easy to read- keeps you engaged.
2,Lousy Battery But Worse Customer Support Policy,"After only 3 months of use, this phone's battery went down to 15 to 20 minutes of talk time. Ok, batteries do that. BUT, Samsung's policy is that to replace a defective batter you must first SEND the battery in for testing and IF they find it defective they will send you a warranty replacement. Meaning, you could be out of a phone for days or weeks.My cell phone is critical part of my business tool set and being without a phone for days is beyond the pale. This is my last Samsung cell phone for a while, although I do like the physical and software features of the phone."
2,To much filler,"I was disappointed in the book, to many full page diagrams. This is a 167 page book that has 2/3 diagrams. I expected more in depth about coaching 4-4-2, not just pictures. If I had been able to review the book in a book store, I would not have bought it."
5,Fantastic Introduction to the 4-4-2 system particularly zone defense,"This book is exactly what it purports to be, a practical programme for coaching the 4-4-2.It favours tactical drills, in the same way other coaching books do with technical drills.Must be read a number of times, and I found it particularly useful to actively play out (using Subuteo or connect four discs) the formations and the adjustments to the defensive shape made by the movement of attackers.Really helped me understand the relationship between the midfield and backline.Were some typos - I think a paragraph missing in the strategy and tatics chapter, however the book is focused on practical zonal shape so not much value in there anyway.Particularly good chapters on double-teaming and off-side tactics."
3,"one of My ""boys"" bought this for Me and....","Well ok first the problems, the keyboard draw sticks! there was alot of damage, the box ripped and dings and dents, also the two door handles were missing, thats probably due to the fact there was a hole in the bottom of the box! Other then that its a wonderful BIG desk. the draws (other then the keyboard one) move smoothly. This desk was a big pain to put together! all dings/dent except one I was able to hide in the back, the other one I just covered with My phone. oh also the cd rack is made of plastic NOT metal. All in all I feel its not quite worth the money. Id pay 150.00 for it if I had the choice! Just realize that its going to take MORE then 2 people to put together and it will take many hours as the instructions are only semi clear. Good luck!"
3,"original, fun","Anyone whose sick of pretentious, arty electronic music will like this. Anyone who's into hip hop but wants to dig deeper into electronic music will like this. Though I still prefer his first album, this is a great follow-up, and Cex has another 2 albums coming out this year! The other reviewers have said more about this album than I could, but don't get me wrong, I love it!Oh, and for the record, Amazon put the wrong image up for the album cover. The building falling over, that's the cover of an Electric Company album. Cex's cover is a bit wierder and more disturbing, but it's not really meant to be taken seriously."
5,All Time Classic,"The Exterminating Angel is a brilliant movie. Luis Bunuel is one of the few directors to be able to create a completely fascinating world with seemingly mundane ideas. The film is about guests arriving at a dinner party and for various reasons are unable to leave. This simple, but interesting premise illustrates how we do not live our lives in any logical fashion and how the situations with which we are faced are what shape our world not anything as ridiculous as free will. For anyone who can see life as it really is and not brainwashed by our societies propoganda this is the most entertaining movie ever made about human nature. This is not a movie to take a date to it is one to be savored the rest of your life as you watch an innocent situation turn into the most thought provoking film you will ever see. The pace is slow, but in the hands of Bunuel it is also very entertaining and yes funny."
1,POOR TREATMENT of a GREAT FILM,"A Warning: this video is poor. Really, really poor. Not only is the film in desperate need of restoration, the subtitles sometimes fly off screen, rendering them impossible to read. Of course, you can't read them anyway, because they're in white. The whites in the film contrast the subtitles in such a way that nearly half of all text is unreadable.My 1 star rating reflects the poor quality of this product, not the film (which is among the greatest of all time)."
5,Brutal Bunuel,"""Exterminating Angel"" is Bunuel's horror masterpiece of bourgeoisie apathy gone haywire.The plot is simple: VIPs are invited to a feast at a castle...trouble is-- after the party is over...they can't leave...They are unable to find their way out of the labyrinthine chaos they have fallen into...Who is to blame?...Where is the Host?...Things get crazy...Bunuel's masterpiece...hands down!"
5,cool movie,"you see in this movie the rich finally get a taste of what it is to be poor. i heard somewhere else it resembles the way things are in a concentration camp. they pray and of course this not working they get desperate, they steal form each other and get into drugs and witchcraft better shut up already, and they fight with each other and then they begin to stink ha ha ha. i mean is so funny. and the ending and everything. each scene sometimes becomes a story in itself just like his next movies like the milky way and the phamtom of liberty. and theres the always cool dream sequences. awesome movie from the greatest filmaker of all time with godard and renoir."
2,I waited two years to buy this on Amazon!,"I waited two years to buy this on Amazon. The price has always been $60+ until I recently found it for $16. (You got to love how prices for some of these films fluctuate--Amazon's very own micro-market economy.) Anyway . . .So, I had been wanting to see this for a long time. The reviews were good, and I liked the premise of how these people gather for dinner, but can't leave. Anyway . . .I was bored out of my mind! Not to mention I could only read about a third of the subtitles because of ingenious white lettering on frequent white background. I dozed off twice trying to get through this--had to rewind and rewatch.Reading the reviews for this film was much enjoyable than actually watching the film itself. If you want to watch a good Bunuel film, go for Los Olvidados instead."
2,Not my cup of tea.,"Believe me, I get what THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL was all about. It was a retelling of LORD OF THE FLIES. But instead of preppy boys, it was about their parents. And instead of taking place on an island, it took place at an estate. This film could've been great if it had done either one of two things: (1) Develop the characters more. Unlike LORD OF THE FLIES, I could not understand any of the characters as I did with Ralph, Piggy, Simon, et. al. Because of this, I did not think THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL did a very good job examining the human condition. (2) Make it funny! If you're not going to take this film seriously and develop the characters, then at least give the audience something to laugh at. I didn't think the characters in THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE were that well developed either. But it was laugh-out-loud funny! And between the two films, I'd take the latter."
3,Buyer beware,"Though the film is wonderful, the Criterion edition is disastrous. Something is dreadfully wrong with the soundtrack -- it is very unpleasant to listen to and sounds as though it was digitally sampled and then re-processed at an incompatible bit-rate. Consequently there is a constant in and out between too loud (and distorted) and virtually silent. The same thing is true of the Criterion ""Honeymoon Killers,"" of which there is a version available in France that has a perfectly great sounding track. I don't know why such problems surface with our ""premium"" DVD producer. In any case, paying top dollar for such a technical disaster seems quite unjust."
4,"Oh, yeah, baby...","To put it simply, the movie kicks @$$. (Kind of dips in the middle a bit, though.)The quality of this version, however, is atrocious. The subtitles need to be redone as the originals are impossible to read at many points. That, and it appears as if someone watched the film with a camcorder on a tripod off to the side."
4,Thanks Barrons,"This book was helpful. Its best 2 months before the test because there is alot to learn. I took the test last weekend. The barrons book gives most stategies that are going to be on the test. DON""T write on the test in the book. This was one of my mistakes. Make copies so that you go back and do the test over again. But the barrons book isnt the only book i also suggest you get the kaplan book. OMG this book helped me the most. But the best was from my teacher. It does not matter how smart you are GO to your teacher and ask for help even if you don't need it. They can give youlittle worksheets to take home for practice. I learned this a little bit. I hope you don't make the same mistake. :)"
2,sshsat barrons,"I had bought this book for my younger sister since she really wants to go to a specialized highschool. I thought this book might have things that it didn't have in the new barrons book, but I was wrong! it is exactly the same. So if you are thinking about whether or not to buy the book and see if there is much differnce, well there is none. Majority of the diagnostic exams are the same. The book hasn't changed much. For anyone who is also thinking of sending their duaghter, son, sister extc... for specialized highschool plz let me know what your planing to do to prepare them. I have still yet to find out what prep course I should place her since she is in 7th grade now, also if whether kaplan is a good prep or princeton? MY EMAIL tania_payal@hotmail.com."
3,Interesting Tarzan Movie,"First: WB Archieves are to expensive for no subtitles, Chapter etc and not restored.But the movie itself is very interesting and I bought it only because I wanted see Hurd Hatfield (""the picture of Dorian Gray""). Also nice to see french actress Denise Darcel.Anthony Caruso play another bad guy role.Lex Barker is in Germany/Switzerland/Austria best remembered for those german Western movies ""Winnetou 1-3"", ""The Treasure in the Silver Lake"" etc of the novel-author Karl May.Sound and picture are ok.No bonus features."
5,y4k uberzone,great nonstop breakbeats. play this disc on a good system with subs and it will shake the house down!
3,"If you like Vanoni, this is a nice collection of her music","I bought this in an attempt to find the Apputamento song that is part of the Ocean's 12 Soundtrack.The song is on the album, but its a different arrangement. If you're looking for the Apputamento song from Ocean's 12, its best you buy the soundtrack.Nonetheless, this is a great collection of songs. I don't understand italian but I find Vanoni's voice is entrancing."
2,Ornella Vanoni,"I like Ornella Vanoni very much. I bought this CD mainly because Vanoni sings the title song ""Appuntamento"" from the movie Ocean's Twelve. However, this CD was disappointing. The song ""Appuntamento"" was done in an entirely different arrangement...this is true of the other songs as well."
1,not so grand,"I must say I was very disappointed with the recording quality of this disk - and no, it was not my equipment that was faulty"
4,Best bolt arrows,"These are a good bolt for small game and protecting around your home, much better than other types of course you only get a couple of shots with any bolt, but really like these."
2,Breaks Easy,"Well, I expected a great long lasting bolt yet what I got was horrible. Every time I shot one of these they she back end broke off shooting into dirt. DO NOT BUY!!!"
2,OK for one shot use,"Shooting into paper and cardboard target from 15 feet with 80lb Cobra pistol crossbow, the fletches broke off almost every time. These shoot straight and hit hard, so good for game, just not for target shooting."
3,breaks easily even is shot from 50 lb crossbow.,The black part is plastic and is ATTACHED to the thin aluminium body very very weakly. These arrows are a little smaller and thinner than a New pencil AND are TWO Fletched (have 2 vanes instead of 3 vanes or fletches) and because of this veer off the target (generally the more fletches the higher the accuracy). But for the price of 7 dollars and free shipping this is to be expected.
3,Better than the plastic,"Maybe I should be more charitable than 3 stars for el cheapo bolts, for el cheapo crossbow pistols. These little crossbow pistols are a lot of fun for the money, but the two styles of bolts available for them aren't very durable.THE CONS: The fins (the black part in the photos) on these ""aluminum"" bolts are a very cheap, brittle plastic that break off easily.THE PROS: The aluminum shaft version is about half again the weight of the plastic shaft version, with the weight balanced toward the front of the dart. They fly straight and group well at up to about 50 feet. By comparison, the all plastic with metal points (which also break easily) are all over the place and don't group at all. Don't waste your money on the plastic ones. The aluminum shaft version, at least, is fun to shoot - just figure on buying lots of them to allow for a lot of broken fins."
3,"Only one shot, but also bang for your buck","I have the 80 lb pistol crossbow with the self cocking handle. These things shoot awesome and fast! I'm shooting at a wood box made of something like white or yellow pine. These things stick into the wood about an inch -- hard to get out. I'd say 90% of the time the back plastic part pops off and breaks. A few times I was able to use a arrow a second time, but even then I was wary because the impact of the arrow with the wood had made the aluminum arrow slightly curved, this happened every time. I guess I should shoot into something softer like a Styrofoam target or something. One time i missed and this thing went right through a metal cabinet which was probably like the thickness of a gym locker. Had to open the cabinet and look for it inside. Another time I hit a cement cinder block and the arrow took a nice big deep chunk out of it."
5,Good bolts,"They travel some distance, can be reused a few times, but break if they hit something hard."
4,decent bolts for pistol type crossbows,the one thing id say these need is a slight twist in the fins to let them spin to increase accuracy. they are pretty durable and are way way better then the crap plastic ones out there
4,"Ammo, ammo, ammo.",Can never have enough ammo right. Well the bolts are good and you do lose them at times and they go into the ground etc. Great price for a handful of ammo and I would and will purchase again.
3,"For the price, it's what you would expect","These bolts are better for someone who is completely new to using crossbows. If you're looking for something more permanent, than I suggest spending the extra money for more solid bolts. The plastic ends break off fairly easy and without warning. If you need something temporary and cheap for practice, then these work well for that. Anyone serious about shooting, however, look elsewhere."
2,arrows,Not what I thought it was still sitting in the packaging husband says that he can use it for something else. So I just kept it.
1,Ed,This product is cheaply made. Most of them are worthless as the tips or fluted end came off the first time they were shot into a card board box.
3,Work fine,"I'm not really able to give the best review for this product, The crossbow my son bought to use these with broke but the seem to hold up good."
1,First time they were shot 6 left the string to the target....,"One ""exploded"" on firing and broke into all of it's separate parts (fletching, shaft, point), 3 broke when they hit a bail of straw hay, 2 survived only to break on second firing. Need i say more?"
4,High impact arrows,"These are great little arrows. Used with an 80 lb pistol crossbow they work really well for small game. They are a little heavy FOC so they are't great for long range, but then that isn't the intended use for a pistol crossbow anyway."
1,Cheaply Made!,"The price is good, but u get what u pay for. Arrows are cheaply made and fall apart on impact, the tips fall out and the fletchings break off every time."
4,As advertised,"Decent quality for the price. Just need to be sure you have a good, solid target made from fairly dense foam or similar or they will go right through!"
4,"Overall, awesome.","These bolts are awesome bang for the buck, fire well and for the most part are pretty sturdy. However, if they hit something solid a time or two you can basically consider them a lost cause as they will bend and bow slightly making them fire much more inaccurate."
2,CHEAP,These bolts are extremely cheap. the plastic fins break off after about 2 or 3 shots. the plastic version of these bolts are much better built. the fins do not break off after hitting a piece of plywood. unlike the aluminum ones which the fins will break off after shooting it into the soft wet dirt in my backyard. VERY cheaply made i suggest getting the plastic ones.
5,pointed discussions,"As I have a tendency to hit targets that are harder than normal, it behooves me to make sure that I have enough darts for my crossbows - just in case the Zombie hoard appears.the seller sent these quickly and I got them just a few days after ordering."
4,You get what you pay for!,I bought these bolts because they were alot cheaper then others out there. They do hold up pretty well and shoot accurate. Yet the plastic on the end breaks and essentially ruins the bolt. Secondly the tips come off easily if pulled out too fast from the target. I recommend these because if shot properly and used correctly they can last... better then spending fifteen dollars for better quality ones.
2,you get what you pay for here guys...,you get what you pay for here... the bolts are really nice aside from the cheap brittle plastic fletching which will crack or break if they hit any thing that has some density... but dont let that scare you away... the aluminum tube is durable and the metal tips are really nice aswell.if you want you can replace the shaft with the tube from a bic pen.... dont remove the black end cap though just the pen part... after that use some tape and add some fletchings... doing that works really well with my 80pound selfcocking cbow... the tape fletching is flexable but still provides stability
2,High Impact Crap,"I shot all of my aluminum bolts and within 2 hours had broken all of them shooting at a fairly soft target (Thin plywood), and then was able to shoot one plastic bolt more than all of the aluminum bolts combined without showing any wear and tear.In short, buy the plastic bolts instead of these aluminum ones. Shiny metal doesn't make up for wastng money on what is essentially ""high impact"" crap."
1,Bad quality,This is a made in china cheap quality product one shot and there gone for good I mean.if you want to waste your money go ahead ill just look for some made in the U.S.A arrows for my crossbow pistol
3,not sure bout this one,these arrows are pretty good arrows if you how the right crossbow to shoot them if you don't have the right bow the string will miss the arrow and sometimes it scares me and it could hurt the string or more importantly the bow but there ok
2,not as good as they could be,"These arrows were great for awhile, very sharp and cool looking, but they break very easily because they are not as fexible as the all plastic arrows so as soon as they come in contact with anything that is even relitively hard they snap. I broke 5 of them in the first day. I would recomment that you try another product first."
3,Not Bad Not Great,"First of all, the packaging is extraordinarily generic. Not a big deal, but perhaps a sign that these are not top notch. Two of the flights have broken off so far. They are molded plastic that seems to be molded right in to the shaft of the bolts. On the plus side they are sharp and have decent flight characteristics. I foresee many a rabbit in my pot due to these bolts."
1,cheaply made not durable one to three shots before breaking on hay bail,not good poorly made they cannot take high impact as described not even on target in a hay bail fail
2,nada,"The crossbow I bought to use them with broke twice, so I have no idea if they work well or not..."
3,Ok,"The arrows break easily i would reccomend the plastic ones they are way better and cheaper, wen you hit something the fin flies ryte off"
2,One shot wonder,"Buy some glue first, I made a target out of cardbord stacked 10x, after shooting each arrow the first time ether the tail section or the tips would come out, the tail sections do not fit snugly into the aluminum so when you reglue them make shure their straight. I have not tried other brands but the ones that came with the bow had thread in tips."
1,Don't Purchase These if...,you're planning on using them with the Barnett Banshee Intermediate Compound Bow as suggested by Amazon.com. No way these two items will work with each other. Now I have the hassle of returning the arrows and looking for the correct product to go with my daughter's new bow.
2,"Ok, but i wouldn't buy them if i we're you.","When i got these in the package, they looked wonderful but once i started shooting them, the fletching completely fell off. This really dissapointed me. Also the tips were bent a little bit and i didn't even use them yet. They also bend really easily after about 30 shots. What i did with the fletching and tip is used super glue to glue the fletching back in and straighten the tips out. I would recomened carbon or plastic bolts if you are just target shooting. If you are hunting than these are probally best, although the fletchings might come out due to over penetration. So watch out for that. Over all i don't like these bolts. Don't get them if you want them to last long. I guess you get what you payed for, right?"
2,Needs better description,"Bought this item for my 150 lb crossbow, only to find, when they arrived, that they were only about 6 inches long. Definitely not going to fit on my crossbow. Haha. Maybe the keebler elves have a need for arrows this short, but not me."
3,Decent,Better than plasticDon't recommend for shooting at woodShoot hay or cardboard or foamI tested one on wood and it broke the 5th shot where the metal meets the plasticSo overall decent just not for woodAlso they are still usable after the end breaks off just don't expect more then 10 feet with any accuracy after that
1,not good,the packagehad been returned it was opened when i got it not even taped close guess sending new stuff was not a priority
1,These are crossbow BOLTS not ARROWS as the title description implies,ALMOST bought these without actually reading. $6.00 was a great deal even for a pack of cheap target arrows fro my daughter. They NEED to change the item name to BOLTS not ARROWS!!!
1,Low Price for a Reason,"The tips seem to break very easy, some weren't even threaded right, the back of the arrow is a cheap poorly glued in place plastic and they break after the first use often."
3,broken fletches,Many of the 'feathers' broke off on first shot. Other than that I was able to maintain a moderately tight grouping.
4,"Seems durable,shipped fast","This item shipped in a small 4 days(ordered on a friday). I am pretty sure this product is plenty durable for my 80 pound crossbow pistol,but i can't get the tip off to save my life. May need someone stronger.I would recommend this product to everybody i know that has a crossbow pistol!!"
2,I can see why it was never released.,"Verne's publisher called this ""lackluster and lifeless,"" so it was locked up in a safe and never released.Reading it, I can understand why. The characters are boring and predictable, and the dialogue is flat. Verne's vision of the future is not particularly intriguing.Really, this book is only worth reading for Verne's sometimes prophetic predictions. He imagines the elevator, the automobile and fax machines, for example.Not horrible, but not up to the standard I expect from Verne."
1,A xenofobic book to avoid,"The only merit of the book are Verne's technological prophecies whichat times are very accurate. For the rest, this is a very bad book.Worse than bad, it's xenofobic: Anything non-French is looked down upon.The racial arguments are nauseating: it's like reading nazi propeganda.The author goes so far to glorify war, to long for the days that you couldkill a man in duel. All about the so-great French honour. Next to that,the story itself is empty. It's mainly a summation of all the 'great Frenchauthors', nothing more. This book discussed me. Avoid it if you do notbelieve in the supremecy of pure French blood. Today, such a novel wouldbe considered fundamentalistic, and un-fit for publication.To conclude: Verne's publisher was right no the publish this. It's a shamethat the modern day publisher did."
4,An interesting look ahead,"Jules Verne's ""Paris in the Twentieth Century"" is a fascinating look at how one 19th century person predicted the 1900s. Seemingly typical for this genre (think Huxley's Brave New World or Orwell's 1984), Verne pits a lonely humanist against the crush of an efficient and overbearing technocracy. Read in the context of the history of the 1860s -- Napoleon III had established the Second Republic in 1852, of which he was emperor, Paris itself was in the midst of a major reconstruction and renovation, and the future of liberal humanism may have been seen to be suffering setbacks -- ""Paris"" is an important window into the thinking of French scientifically-inclined intellectuals."
2,Lost,"If only it had stayed lost, maybe surviving only in rumor and speculation, we could have imagined the great things Verne might have predicted. We could have wondered at the clever plot twists. Just out of reach, it could have been great.But in our hands, apart from his reporting on the newest of the new inventions of his time (e.g. a rudimentary fax/telegraph machine), we can only follow the thin, strident plot and marvel at the visions not seen.Of course if you love Verne, you have to read it. Just lower your expectations a bit. There's no Captain Nemo here."
4,Decent purchase,"When I ordered this I was expecting what I usually get when ordering a used item off of Amazon... a gently worn book with some makrer on it and some dog-eared pages, etc. What I got was a very heavily worn book with bite marks out of the cover. It's not like I was going to put it on a display shelf or anything, so I wasn't that disappointed. The price was very affordable, after all."
3,"A breezy read, poor fictionally, in short a must-buy.","I learned a lot about 19th c. french authors, & 19th century's view of the future. This is a genuine scientific extrapolation about the future & is therefore A. one of the first & B. one of the most accurate. His sociocultural predictions were ,surprisingly, his most prescient. Sadly, as fiction this is very didact & not very engaging. The romance element seemed especially poor since the woman was ,in least as I recall, even worse developed than the others. Still, it's historically interesting. In my opinion Disch is full of it & science fiction started in Europe, & this supports that."
1,The Original Editor Had It Right,"I don't know which book previous reviewers read (and gave it 4 stars) but this novel is truly awful!!! The original editor buried it and there it should have stayed. Unfortunately, someone has decided to capitalise on Jules Vernes reputation to make a fast buck. Representation of this poor work casts neither in a good light.Not much positive to say about it other than the fact he got a few predictions right. However, the literary construction around these ideas was very poor. Thankfully a short read."
2,boring,I can read pretty much anything and rarely put down a book but this one was pretty boring and I could not finish it.
3,Another Classic by Jules Verne,"It's amazing to think that Jules Verne wrote these creative thoughts way back in the late 1800s. He was one heck of a genius. I think he wrote this for his son. The main character was named MICHAEL (like his only son). I truly enjoyed the book--but it doesn't work as well in the 21st Century. Time may have surpassed him; however, his cleverness for a well-written novel shines."
4,A nice book to read when in a thinking mood,I enjoyed reading this book. Seeing how Verne envisioned the future and comparing his vision with how things actually turned out was fun. There are many thought-provoking conversations between characters and this is a nice book to read when in a thinking mood.I like Michel Dufrenoy. I feel for him as he struggles to find his way in a world that does not appreciate art or artists. Maybe it would help him to understand the difference between making a living and living a life; that your purpose in life does not have to be how you earn your living.This is a nice book with plenty of ideas to think about.
3,"Intriguing, but flawed narrative","While this work is intriguing in its predictions that have or have not been proven, as an actual story it's weak. Neither the plot nor the characterization is compelling, and it stands as a work that few would read if Verne's name wasn't attached to it. Recommended for a completionist scifi reader who wants to check out an early dystopian reflection, but there are a lot of better books available."
2,Disappointed,"I was really excited about this product with the one review it had. I'm not impressed. I've used it for 2 weeks straight. No difference in skin tone, texture, etc. It's just sticky. Do not put it on your neck...ick! Waste of money...I should have know better just to stick with my ProActiv."
1,Sent me expired product!,"I don't know if Olay has discontinued this product or what, but I can't find it in any store anymore. So, I thought I'd order it from Amazon. I ordered 2 since my husband and I both use it and both tubes arrived expired! One had an expiration date of 12/2008, the other 2/2009! I don't think I'll be ordering beauty products off the internet anymore."
1,expired!!!,I was extremely upset when this product arrived and it was expired by over a year. I would not use this company again.
3,It's Sublime but....,"Well it's a great mix of Sublime songs but, they have ""remastered"" a lot of great variance in the sound of the originals out of it. For instance, listen to ""Don't Push"" off 40oz vs this version and you can hear a great reduction in the ""Sublime"" sound. Bottom line, if your really into Sublime you will prob be disappointed in this but if you are not familiar with them this is a great ""Best of"" CD."
4,amazon download sucks,I will never download again from amazon I had to download each track from the almighty cloud of sh@t Id rather pay more for less hassel I could have stolen cd quicker the tracks sound great
1,not good,Scratched and would not play a single song what a joke Why give a good rating when the disc has obviously been destroyed. I payed more for a worthless sublime than I did for the other acceptable disc's. Somebodies idea of a joke
3,This is NOT CHRISTIAN RAP!!!,"THIS IS NOT CHRISTIAN RAP! This is Prime Minister from Sacramento Cali. The cd is ALLright if you are a fan of sac town rap. I have Prime Minister's other compilation, ""Sac Towns most wanted"", which is a little better than this cd. There are a few wack beats on here such as first couple of tracks. Alot of just ok beats and three hype ones such as Weed Greed, which is my favorite. Worth for the price."
3,Good for beginners; Not for Patched Officials,"I hoped that this book would provide more insight for patched officials who want to improve their skills. The book gave some good advice, but was mainly an introductory review of mechanics which are covered by the NFHS manuals.I DO recommend this book for teenage and non-patched umpires who want to improve their skills without going through cryptic and boring NFHS mechanics and rules books."
2,Entertaining but a bit shallow,"Does not display the depth or completeness of a Childress book, but certainly entertaining enough for little league umpires."
1,"Wish I hadn't bought it, not worth the cost.","There was nothing in this book that our association hasn't covered nearly every week. I was very dissapointed. It offered little tidbits like ""a postgame review can help you learn from experience"". Don't we ALL do ""postgame reviews"", even if it is simply going over the game in our head on the drive home? I certainly do. No, I'm not he best umpire in our association. I would rate myself as somewhere in the middle. The book offered me nothing new, nothing that our association doesn't talk about constantly. Buy a Childress, or save your money."
4,Cushion storage for deck,"I needed storage on my deck for chair cushions, instead of bringing them in the house when the weather threatened to be bad. This bench is nice and bright with a large capacity for all my cushions. Other plastic containers were dark or beige and looked ""cheap."" I received it very quickly. I was able to snap most of it easily together following the directions and checking the labeled pieces and diagram. The lid is a little more difficult to engage and took both my husband and myself to get it alligned and snapped into place."
1,Missing bottom,Box was very easy to assemble. Only had 5 pieces and was missing the bottom piece. No quality control people get it together.
5,suncast DB8800BW pool Deck Box,this is a great va;ue for the money. We found it easy to assemle and liked the wheels so we can move it around easily. Has abig capacity for storing all our pool equiptment and toys. Would reccommend this to anyone. Nice and sturdy. pleasant to look at.
3,sturdy but difficult to assemble,"This is a sturdy and attractive pool storage box. It was ok putting most of it together, but the lid was difficult. I never did get it on correctly. But it keeps things dry, and was a good price too."
2,Suncast Pool Deck Box DB000BW,"The box itself is Ok, if you can put it together. We cannot get the side panels to stay together. So as yet (2 weeks) we still do not haveit set-up. Very frustrating."
3,Assembly a Challenge!,"Looked a long time to find a reasonably priced deck box in white. Looks good now that I finally got it together.The first side snapped in fine. The second side? Now that was more of a challenge but not half as bad as attaching the lid! After experimenting with WD40, a flat head screwdriver and a hammer I finally succeeded but not before drawing blood. Regarding the lid,finally laid the box down on the back side with lid open and with the help of the screwdriver was able to snap the hinges into place. With the tempermental right side, I held it in place where it was supposed to snap into the bottom (but kept unsnapping) until I got the back panel in place. That worked fine.Now you may want to know that I'm no brute of a man in his prime who had all this trouble. In fact I'm a 68 year old widow with limited strength but lots of determination. Probably should have waited for help.Bottom line, it was worth the effort. Lots of storage and looks good on my deck."
4,Good deck box - not hard to assemble,"After buying one at a local pool store, my wife requested another and I found it cheaper on Amazon. Since the one from the pool store came assembled, I read some of the assembly complaints and was worried. Actually, it worked out fine.The unit seems a bit flimsy at first, but I've sat on it, dragged it up a ladder to my deck and packed it solid with junk -- no complaints. After reading the horror stories, I was very methodical about putting it together. Everything went together smoothly and I was done in less than 10 minutes. The only gotcha was that I was trying to put the sides into the base with the base facing the wrong way. It didn't go, so I didn't force it... checked the instructions and it went fine after that. I'm not sure how it's possible to mess it up unless you get in a hurry or try to force things together. Really amazing how easy it was."
3,handy,"I like the way these look around the pool. They are also very handy to have.I don't quite understand why they are so much more expensive.. I guess the word pool is involved.the sun will damage them over time, and they look faded, etc.They still work well, but if they can be in the shade, they will look better longer.overall not too bad.. just pricey."
4,It is what it is.,I choose this after looking at and reading many reviews on outdoor storage boxes. I didn't need anything fancy or expensive. I use it to keep our pool supplies and tools in. For the price it is worth it. It keeps the rain and weather out. . It is easy to put together and we've had no problem with it.
5,Wonderful Music,"Akin to the Gregorian chants that was all the rage a few years ago, these beautifully crafted songs leaves you in a trance. Wonderful music to fall asleep to and to wake up to. Our little window to peace and quiet after a day with two wonderful yet demanding kids!! Highly recommended."
5,The real deal!,If your a football coach looking for the holly grail of coaching Don Schnake breaks it down to what is most important. There is more how-to and common sense in this one book than in my entire coaching library.
4,Simplicity Is Good,"The idea behind this book is very sound in that when designing a football offense it is very easy to try and put too much in the play book. The Simple Six asserts that a coach should have six plays that form the core of your offense. Six plays that you can run any time any place on the field that your players know and understand. The plays diagrammed in the book are based on the I-formation, but the author makes it clear that the plays are shown as guidelines, and that your own Simple Six can be based on any football offense. The plays follow a logical progression, and the plays all look similar to the defense at least at the beginning of the plays. In a nutshell, this book helped prepare me to be an Offensive Coordinator and eliminate superfluous plays from the offense I coach.A very good investment."
4,STRONG POP COLLECTION,"A surprisingly effective excursion into pop for Baez, with a set of melodic songs gracefully interpreted. The lilting reggae of No Woman No Cry works well - she tweaked the lyrics (Trenchtown becomes Boystown) for a more universal application. Song At The End Of The Movie and Before The Deluge are magnificent sad songs without being despairing, whilst Honest Lullaby is autobiographical and reminiscent of the earlier Gulf Winds. An accomplished album then, with strong material and sophisticated delivery."
4,"Sort of different, moody fare from Joan.","I have collected every record from this amazing woman, this one is one of my favorites. I guess that's because of the time it was released. It has a very moody tone to it. Beautifully sung, the songs are upbeat, reflective, honest, and moving. It is a hard to find recording, but worthy of a place in your CD library, even for hardcore folkies."
1,Adapter doesn't fit the 8100,This adapter did not fit into the back of my Inspiron 8100. It was not shaped correctly. I returned it for a refund.
2,NOT ENOUGH INFORMATION FOR BEGINNERS,"This book is vey difficult to understand and learn from. It's explanations are too abbreviated with not enough information on each code. Also, not all codes and conventions are included, and it reads like a novel, meaning not very descriptive or illustrative. Too many paragraphs and sentences."
2,Not what I thought it would be.,"The book doesn't go in-depth in it's explainations. It is written more for the seasoned script writer and not the beginner. I found it very confusing and not enough detail to be of any use to me. I preferred ""Javascript, Demystified""."
5,Pays for itself quickly,"The minute I opened this book and began to browse the table of contents, I found at least two solutions immediately relevent to things I'm currently working on. I can't wait to see what else I get from this book."
5,The Healing Musician: A Guide to Playing Healing Music,"This is an excellent book! I am currently a student in the Music for Healing and Transition Program, and this book perfectly dovetails with the classes. It describes in detail many topics needed to become a healing musician. I especially liked the chapter dealing with modal music and arrhythmic music. Also included are a CD and the sheet music to demonstrate the categories of music described in Ms. Benson's book. Anyone in the MHTP program needs to have this book!!"
4,Death by suicide,"I was curious because the writer has the same name as me.The information itself is excellent. Very heartwarming. You can feel what the writer wants you to see from this story. Small problems with text but otherwise, I recommend for others to see."
5,"We all may fall, but this book stands tall!","Julie's book is very timely and instructive in how TOC can be applied to healthcare in particular, and the services industries in general. The book is engaging and powerful and also breaks new ground (such as expanding on Dr. Goldratt's 6 layers of resistance; and the real-world, relevant examples of use are especially good). In addition to the strong treatment of some of the key TOC Thinking Process tools, the book is a how-to for change management as well. I have read ""We All Fall Down"" 3 times, and each time have gained new insights into the applications."
1,Delayed shipment,"For a textbook shipper, this merchant take to long to send book. I order book in mid-December, I did not get the book until mid-January. This is unacceptable"
5,Sound Track is AWESOME!,"This soundtack changed the way I viewed ""classical"" music, which I did not think I liked. I was wrong. The music changed my mind entirely! It is mellow and nice to have in the background when I am on the computer, or reading, knitting, whatever. Mose restful!"
2,Didn't Work for Me!,"This sure doesn't work for my dry skin......and the fragrance is kind of sickening. Sorry I took a chance with this basic Olay product - maybe the Regenerist line is better, but haven't tried it."
5,What This World Needs Is...,"more CDB!I was searching under ""new releases"" under ""cowboy country"" and this album popped up #1. I wouldn't put this album under ""cowboy,"" though. It is an eclectic mix of rock, jazz, blues and good old Charlie's fiddle."
3,You get what you pay for,"This item does work, however it is cheaply held together and the charger split apart. It can still be used if squeezed together but I have since upgraded to a USB charger instead."
5,Razr V3 Car Charger,This product is exactly what I wanted. I had been looking for a car charger for my cell phone and did not want to pay what my cell phone company was asking. I have so many unused car chargers as you all know that when you get a new phone and need new adaptors. I will be so glad in 2012 when everything will be compatible! Anyway I am well pleased with this and the cost was right plus getting it in a timely matter was a plus as well. It was identical to the picture that was shown.
2,"Good price, the charger worked, but didn't work great","It charged my Razr, but it messed up the battery so it would die out in a matter of hours instead of days. I went online and researched and found out that sometimes car chargers can do this. Then, based on what I found, I let the battery go completely dead and charged it via the wall outlet and that fixed my problem. I'll still use this, but only in an emergency. I think it worked ok the first few times I charged it, so I'm not certain what the problem was."
2,Local Oxford preacher,"This man lived and preached long ago in the Oxford, PA area. People remember him as a great speaker. He touched their hearts. This book helps bring the memories back."
1,black an decker router that turned out to be a drill,The router thar I was supose to receive came in as a drill. i emailed the supplier and they said the discription from amazon was incorect and they would send the right part on 12-07-2008 and as of today 12-24-2088 have not received it or the return paper for the drill. Would posible be interested in the drill if the price was right. Could you help me out with this problem or call me and let me know what is going on.Thank you Ken Biorn 208-317-5157
1,Get what you pay for,"I purchased this router because I was curious to see what I could get for... less than the highly rated, Bosch 2 HP variable speed plunge router I've been dreaming about. I wasn't expecting much from the Black & Decker, but two deficiencies did surprise me. The collet has only one split - I've been told that to properly grip the bit, there should be four splits in a 1/4"" collet, and I've seen inexpensive routers with only two, but never just one. I was even more surprised to find there is no way to adjust the height of the bit from under the table when using the router in a table. To change the depth of cut, you have to remove the router from the table, reset the plunge depth gauge, plunge the router and lock it down, and reinstall it in the table. Since I bought this router to use both in-hand and in a table, it wouldn't work for me, especially since I often make cuts using two or three passes with gradual adjustments of depth in-between."
5,High Performance Router,"This is a high performance router with special features:Powerful 2 HP, 10 amp high performance motorDust extraction port for a cleaner work area and improved visibilityElectronic variable speed for improved cut quality and controlPlunge action for greater versatility and controlRack-and-pinion height adjustment for greater accuracy"
3,Good to watch when,"you're in the mood to laugh at just how bad a movie can be, but that's about it. Where the hell did these flicks show when first out? They were way too tame for the porno houses and way too idiotic for ""regular"" theatres.... If you find this for $5 or under, grab it...."
5,FABULOSO!!!,"Joe Marzano had to deal with idiot producers while trying to make two of these films. These movies are so bad that i'm sure one of them will be made into an opera to debut at the Metropolitan Opera House next season. A ""must"" for lovers of bad films."
3,"Not the most interesting music, but excellently played","The fifth volume of Naxos' series of Sibelius' piano music under Hvard Gimse focuses on miniatures from late in the composer's career. For the most part, these pieces were written for domestic use and put up rather modest technical demands. That said, Gimse really plays them for what they are worth and at time almost manages to make them sound like the masterpieces they clearly aren't. Stylistically these pieces are a long shot from what Sibelius was doing for the orchestra at the same time (although it is, with some imagination, for once maybe possible to hear that the composer of the op. 114 set is the composer of the sixth and seventh symphonies).Sound quality is fine, and anyone who has collected the previous installment in the series need not hesitate. That said, there is no denying that this music is of rather specialist interest, despite some imaginative touches."
4,Another enjoyable little book.,"This is another solid entry in the Mrs. Jeffries series. These little books are lots of fun to read. It's a series that warms its way into a reader's heart. The characters are lovable, and as you read you feel that you really get to know them. They are all quick reads, and are a wonderful way to spend a rainy afternoon. In this book the staff at Upper Edmonton Gardens are pursuing two mysteries - a disappearance which may be a kidnapping or a murder, and an actual murder. Are these two seemingly unrelated incidences connected? We also find out a little about the art world as we watch Mrs. Jeffries and her crew unravel these mysteries. These books are such a lot of fun."
2,Break out the polyester!,"Oh man. Say it ain't so. Thank goodness this wasn't the first album of theirs I checked out. I would have written it off as another insipid ""let's hire some horns to back up our bubble gum groove"" effort so prevalent in music of the lte 70's. This stuff definitely has a disco flavor, with the cheesy additions of strings. It is gathering dust in my CD rack."
2,Arguably Tower Of Power's Worst Album,"If you love Tower Of Power, as I do, you should pick this up for the 4 good songs: ""Rock Baby"", ""And You Know It"", ""It Takes Two (To Make It Happen)"" and ""Just Make A Move (And Be Yourself)"". After these 4 songs, the rest is fairly awful. Michael Jeffries, the vocalist on this album, does a splendid job as the latest in a revolving door of lead singers for the group."
2,Sounds too fake for TOP. Very Uninspiring,"I know Tower of Power can put out better albums than this. The first track, Rock Baby, would make me feel embarassed if someone caught me listening to it. Not a good way to start off the album, but the tracks due get progressively better towards the end. My favorite tracks are Nowhere to Run and Just Make a Move (And Be Yourself). These two at least have some energy to them and save the album from a one star rating. Overall I think the album was overproduced and sounds too comercial and fake, but it has its moments."
2,Too personal,I think it was a good thing for him to write for himself... to get all his thoughts clear and let them be known to everyone. Certainly not ashamed of his belief in God...but way too personal for a serious book on Job
5,A 5 Star Man,"Mike Mason is truly a 5 star man. He writes so beautifully and eloquently. I always reread his books--I have read ""Mystery of Marriage"" 4 times. The ""Gospel According to Job"" is a WOW book and I haven't finished it yet."
5,Mike Mason's Job is most profound,"I have read and pondered the Book of Job many times in my life. But Mike Mason's book goes to the top of my all time list. It is a devotional but so much more. Mason has obviously rubbed shoulders with Joblike suffering, and he has not lost faith. Rather, his faith had been deepened. He has brought a scholarly and devotional blend to his writing. I have been deeply affected and recommend this book to everyone, seeker and believer alike."
5,Perhaps the most profound practical commentary on Christian living ever written...,"My uncle in recommending this book said, 'If I were stranded on a deserted island and could have with me only two books--one, of course, would be the Bible, the other would be The Gospel According to Job.' My personal choices, though, would be (one) the Bible and (two) a comprehensive survival guide with detailed instructions on how to build a boat. However, if I were given a third choice, I would undoubtedly have with me The Gospel According to Job. It's the most profound commentary on Christian living I've ever read. I've handed out dozens to friends and family.All the chapters are two pages in length and are perfect in size for devotional reading. The Gospel According to Job, in truth, is so rich and deep with insight, I find it best to chew on small pieces of its wisdom at a time. It is--in its own right--a practical and spiritual guide for life, and has built me up in ways no other book has. Please read it."
3,Biased scholarship,"The author appears to have done a great deal of research and writes well, but he has a very marked bias in favor of the political leadership by the elite of Boston. As someone who has lived several years each in Boston and Philadelphia, I think the differences are not as great as he represents."
1,Not impressed,"One reviewer said they couldnt put the book down. I didnt have any problems putting it down. Tried several times to get into it. As a Quaker, I felt there was a hint of bias against Quakers. I read about half of the book and decided to move on to something else."
5,Lewis Grizzard meets Charles Kuralt,Well written book that will leave you wanting to read more stories from Jim Buford. I love this book.
1,Unbelievable,"I purchased one of the magnets with the chance of getting my moneys worth. The system was bought in April. The good thing about the system is that it does actually capture the insects, but the bad thing is that it brought more mosquitoes into my yard than it was able to capture. I gave it 1 star because it did collect some of the insects. I would have never bought it if I had known that it was going to lure more insects into my yard than it could catch."
4,Now I can enjoy meals on my back deck,"Bought Mosquito Magnet Cordless Liberty Plus July 3rd, '06. At first I couldn't start the unit;then I learned it has a toggle switch to turn unit on & off. Before we got the unit, we couldn't eat on our deck due to numerous mosquitoes. Within 15 days mosquitoes numbers diminished so we could comfortably dine there. 3 weeks later I emptied a pretty full bag of dead mosquitoes from the unit. Every 21 days I have to refill the propane tank, change the attractant, clear out the valve & use gas reset tool. It's a pain. Don't do this chore in bermudas or mosquitoes will folow you & bite you voraciously."
1,Another Mosquito Magnet Bites the Dust,"Seems to be an ongoing issue with the products from American Biophysics. I bought my $1200.00 Mosquito Magnet Commercial Pro model about two years ago. I bought the commercial model thinking that it would be a bit more durable than the less expensive models. It worked fairly well for the 1st year. The second season I noticed more mosquitoes biting the kids and fewer in the trap. I made sure everything was clean and in working order and kept feeding it propane. At the end of the season my igniter (the little push button starter that looks like the ones found on your typical propane grill) failed so I put it in storage and figured I'd call the company and order a new igniter button (they cost about $10.00 at your local hardware store). American Biophysics just informed me that they won't sell me the $10 igniter. I must buy a reconditioned powerpac for $375.00 instead. Obviously, the product only works for one year before needing to be replaced."
2,New Englander,"I purchased a Liberty Plus approximately three weeks ago. It too suffers from the quality problems noted by other reviewers. In this case, the battery does not hold its charge, so it only works a maximum of three days before the battery needs to be recharged for 24 hours. Although the company has agreed to send another battery, I am not scheduled to receive it for 10 business days. Although the concept behind this product is great, it does not deliver. I do not recommend purchasing this product."
1,"Pure, unmitigated garbage","There's a pattern to these reviews. Can you spot it?I purchased my Mosquito Magnet from Amazon in 2004. It worked well for one season. In 2005, I had some troubles getting it started, but after spending time on the phone with their American Biophysics support department we managed to get it running.Fast forward to 2006. The $2 piezo electric ignitor has died. I called the support department again. ""Unfortunately"", that part can't be replaced, and the whole unit needs to be scrapped. ""Fortunately"", they have a trade in program. For a mere $450+ dollars, I can trade in my dead $600 unit fr a new unit.Does this look like a racket? It should, because it is.I don't know if there are any competing products out there, but I'm certainly going to go looking for them. Avoid this company's garbage at all costs."
1,Caught,"The only thing these machines catches is you. My MM has been runing for three weeks. It is placed optimally, and running perfect. Me and my family are are getting bit, but it doesn't hurt as bad as the bite that MM gave me."
5,Mosquito Magnet wins the second Battle of Concord,"Mosquito Magnet wins the second Battle of Concord.Everyone has heard of The First Battle of Concord, that glorious April morning in 1775, when the Minutemen defeated the invading British. Since then weConcordians have been waging a second battle--against mosquitoes. I'll tellyou our local mosquitoes are as nasty as an army of Red Coats with fixed bayonets!We tried everything. Torches only made them amorous. Zappers became dinnerbells. Foggers had little effect. Then we bought a Mosquito Magnet. And wonthe battle. Our tricon hats are off to a great product.Larry DeLamarter, Concord, Mass.Subj: mosquito magnet review on amazon.comDat"
1,not as advertised,"I bought two of these a year ago. Have had maybe six months of operation with them in all over this period. This product is complicated to operate, finicky and prone to malfunction, consumes a dollar a day in propane, and has had no noticible effect on bugs in my lowcountry South Carolina yard. So now I have two five hundred dollar white elephants.Could the whole Mosquito Magnet story simply be a hoax?"
4,No Problems Here,"Received my MM Liberty Plus last week. It was simple to set up and it started up right away (after charging the battery). It has caught a fair number of bugs so far, but not quite as many as I expected. They really shrink up to nothing once they're dead and it's hard to judge how many there are. We've had some heavy rains lately, so I would expect the number of bugs caught to increase significantly soon. The good news is the bugs haven't been a nuisance so far this year. I'm hoping the MM keeps it that way."
5,Finally Enjoying My Yard,"I debated for a while about dropping over $500 for a backyard gizmo, but after dealing with one too many summers not being able to enjoy my yard - the sprays and candles were completely useless after about 10 minutes! - my wife and I decided to go for it. This machine has been a godsend to our family - our kids can now play outside after dusk and we don't have to worry as much about them getting bitten. I won't deny that the traps do require maintenance (and a continued investment on propane tanks and attractants), but in our mind it's a small price to pay for an enjoyable summer."
1,piece of junk,"It works great for the first season but then as all the others have said, it won't work without sending it in for expensive repairs. Don't be ripped off!"
1,Company is now out of business,"Beware, the original company that made the Mosquito Magnet is now out of business. I purchased my Liberty Plus last year and it worked great all summer. I tried to get it started in April with no luck. After talking to American Biophysics they sent me a replaced battery for $40. That batery was defected and now the company that bought out American Biophysics will not stand behind their products. Read the reviews, these things will work for one season and then they are junk. Buy some Off it is much cheaper and wil last longer."
1,Cost me a buck a bug.,"It killed a few mosquitos, but very few and at a very high cost.I live in the NE, (Massachusetts), and ran the unit from April to fall. Moved the unit trying to find sucess twice, but never saw the catch bag more than a third full in a month of trying. This season the cost of propane is $22 a refill and the bottle has to be changed less than every three weeks. I get a big grin from the guy I buy the bottles from, and I'm probably going to hell for what I'm doing to global warming.Mosquito magnet is very over-rated."
1,Failure out-of-the-box,"It just arrived a week ago and so far the battery won't charge all the way though enough that tech support says the unit should start....which it doesn't. We're told to return the top of the unit, shipping it at our expense. So we have a new unit that cost over $600 and we're already shelling out extra just to get it to work. This isn't a good start."
1,Does not work,"I have had 4 Pro 1100 units and none work. They do not stay running and all the mosquitos will fly back out. when it runs it does catch mosquitos. Tech support sends me a new (remanufactured) one to replace with when i call, but my warranty is running out. My advice save your money don't buy this. you will be sorry!!!!"
1,Avoid this Product,"You should avoid Mosquito Magnet products. They are poorly made. They catch a handful of mosquitos, but not enough to make a difference. They are very expensive, and require constant add-on purchases. Use Deet or screened porches instead."
4,Update - The Second Unit Works Great!,This is a followup followup to the previous review. The second MM has been operating for over a week now and has collected hundreds of mosquitos and other biting insects - a noticeable improvement. This machine is expensive but worth it!
5,I TRIED WITH THIS BOOK'S METHOD AND...,"never thought it would work AT MY AGE OF 46 !!!It did !!!..and really, in just one month!!"
5,"A SUS 48 A`OS, MI ESPOSA","estaba convencida de que jamás tendría cuerpo de artista de cine, como el que ostentaba cuando nos casamos...Hasta que mi suegra le regaló este LIBRAZO!Ahora, s'+olo tres meses más tarde, salgo a la calle luciendo otra vez a una mujer con un cuerpo que todo munco voltea a verla!Este libro hizo el milago !"
2,Cost not worth the benefit,"My book club of 12 bright, well-read people -- who have on occasion forged their way through some pretty obscure ideas and dense prose -- found this book so off-putting to read that the point of the book got lost in the effort. We agreed that there were some interesting ideas in the book, but it just wasn't worth the effort to uncover them. Where, oh where, was the editor?"
1,Disappointed,"I heard about this book during a radio news ""extra"" program. The interview with the author was intriguing as was the title of the book. I was quite disappointed. The book does not read easily and evoked memories of college text books."
4,My eight year old daughters review of the book,I liked this book because I could read the story without any help and one of the kids in the book had my name and the story was exciting.
1,Choose Another CD!,"(sigh)I hate doing a negative review of a CD by an artist I really like, but this thing sucks. The remastering is first class; the sound is really good. But some #@*& decided to take Richard's LAST GOOD LP and re-sequence the songs, add songs that weren't on the vinyl album, delete ones that were on it - and worst of all - FADE OUT A SONG BEFORE IT'S FINISHED (Poor Dog).It's an insult to Little Richard, who has seen so many of his songs mistreated. If you liked your vinyl version, don't buy this. If you've heard about this legendary LP and want it on CD, don't buy this one. Like I said, it hurts, but what I say is true! I would've given it no stars if possible.And PS: if there's a line under this about voting buttons, it's an Amazon virus - I didn't write it."
1,the straw man approach to scholarship,"This book typifies the phoney scholar we have produced in this PC age of anyone's opinion is ""valid"". If you want real scholarship, and real insight into this issue of importance which is once again confabulated by this author--read all of Karl Friday's work. Professor Friday's work is pure genius--this work isn't worth the paper it's written on."
4,"Great bargain, great looks.","This is absolutely one of the best bargains you'll find for a stylish outdoor wicker (synthetic) set. The sofa looks exactly as shown in the picture and well crafted for the price.One thing to note is that this sofa along with the matching single seater sits extremely low to the ground - at 14 inches from ground to top of the cushion. If you're a tall person, you'll have quite some distance of travel before butt meets cushion. Also be sure to have at minimum of 4 - 16x16 pillows for optimal comfort as the sofa comes with no back cusion.All in all a great outdoor sofa for an affordable price."
5,love it! couldn't be happier!,"I ordered this sofa and two arm chairs based off the pictures and the reviews, and boy am I glad I did! This furniture looks way more expensive than it is, and I get tons of compliments on the entire set! I did buy veranda covers for them, so hopefully they will hold up as I live by the ocean. I highly recommend this set."
1,never got it,"I ordered this piece and the matching chairs. I have waited since July for them to be available. They became availabe in September, so I ordered them. They kept moving the delivery date and then canceled the chairs - said they couldn't get them. So I had to cancel the sofa as well. Now I am stuck with 2 chaise lounges and a coffee table but no other furnitue!!!"
3,An old favorite.,The only reason I purchased it was to get the trials to purchase them but they are not compatible with windows 7. I was disappointed only for that reason.
1,Bad choice,"After two months, I had problems with the monitor popping and turning itself off. Dealing with Customer Service was a nightmare. I paid shipping and insurance and was given a ""refurbished"" unit in exchange. Customer service agents were rude and disinterested, or seemed so after waiting on hold for 45 minutes. The replacement they sent has started to have problems waking up from sleep mode, but I have no faith in this brand. I truly regret not spending a few dollars more for a sony or mitsubishi."
2,Avoid GS790 and other Viewsonic products,"This monitor went blurry after 18 months of use. I have had 3 replacements sent, each having its own unique set of problems.I've given up. The last monitor they sent I will keep, even though the left side is blueish as compared to the right side.For those who payed for shipping of their poorly manufactured monitor, next time DEMAND that Viewsonic send you a waybill as I did.Overall, I'm dissatisfied and disappointed with Viewsonic customer service, technical support, and its products. This was my first Viewsonic monitor and my last."
4,Great Image--some minor geometry problems,"The clarity and brightness of the image are excellent. I run the GS790 at 85mhz/1280 resolution and its great for seeing lots of small text or web browsing. The short-neck tube does cause some minor drooping of the image at the top the screen, though. You'll get used to it after a week or so, but you may check out flat-screen or aperature grill monitors if you do intensive graphics work."
2,The monitor Still works but has wierd behavior,Well I have been using this monitor for about a year now and there have been a few things that frankly scared me. There have been approx. 3 times when this monitor (GS790) would make only what I can call is a big Electronic discharge sound and then the monitor would go dark for about 2 minutes.I have used Viewsonic Monitors for the last 5 years and this is the last one I will buy from them. I will start putting my money into the Sony line of Monitors.Viewsonics tech support is just horrible and it is something to be avoided if at all possible. I think the company is moving in the wrong direction and the Quality is suffering from it.
3,TOUR TEMPO,"THE TOUR TEMPO BOOK IS GREAT,I HAVE THE NEW TOUR TEMPO BOOK, MY WONDERFUL WIFE BOUGHT ME A KINDLE FIRE,THE ONLY WAY TO GET NEW BOOK. MY PROBLEM IS THERE WAS NO,I REPEAT NO CD IN OR WITH BOOK??? THANK YOU LARRY HAMMOND"
4,Very Helpful But Not The Complete Answer,"This is a fascinating, easy to read book that provides some very helpful suggestions about swing tempo. However, as some other reviewers have pointed out, this is not the ""cure-all"" for all your swing problems.If you have major flaws in your swing, this book will not be a complete remedy. Speeding up your swing may eliminate or diminish some of your bad swing habits, but not all of them. You will remain frustrated and hit bad shots.While every golfer can benefit from this book, I think the book is even more helpful for those golfers who already have a relatively smooth, effective swing.Tour Tempo does contain exercises to make sure your swing is correct. However, I doubt that most high handicap golfers can implement these suggestions without some further instruction.So, by all means get this book and learn about tempo. It's a vital element of a good golf swing. But don't count on this book alone to cure your swing deficiencies."
5,I wish I had this book 5 years ago...,"but I'm still happy I came across this PEARL! The Y and L drills alone are worth their weight in gold. The illustrations are very excellent as well. I think ""Tour Tempo"", ""Golf for Dummies"" and ""Golf Is Not A Game Of Perfect"" are required reading for any serious amateur. Get them and thank me later!"
3,"No miracle here, just one fundamental to add to your game","The concepts in this book are definitely something every avid golfer needs to know and practice. However, tempo is just one of the keys to hitting a golf ball consistently well, it is NOT the miracle the author claims it to be. Good fundamentals and good mechanics are prerequisite to hitting a golf ball with power and accuracy. If you have those, then building repetitive tempo into your game will definitely help. Bad mechanics, performed with pro-like tempo, will still produce bad shots. I think the drills described in this book are excellent, and would be a good way for a novice golfer to start learning mechanics. The audio CD is a good way to learn the tempo pros use, and will help get your mind off of mechanics pre-swing, and may even help you swing more smoothly. I almost gave this book 4 stars, just for the drills and the audio CD, but have to take one off for the inflated claims."
5,Amazing,"Bought this after reading the rave reviews. Was a bit sceptical, but thought I'd give it a try. Went to the range & did the workout, then started hitting balls. I'm a 22 hdcp, generally have ok mechanics & occasionally put up an 85 but more likely to score 105 or so. Hit all but 2 balls in a large bucket well. Some slight mis-hits, but not too bad. To the course, 96 with 41 putts and 95 with 39 putts. The only thing I need to fix now is short game - driver is straight & long, irons crisp. Losing strokes by hitting over the green too often... yikes! I'd possibly ding this product a bit because the videos are not very useful & I think the material could be presented a bit better, but hey, it's like magic!"
1,Tour Tempo,"Simply put, don't waste your money. The author basically says that your backswing to downswing ratio should be 3 to 1. The CD provided is basically a metronome with tones set at a 3 to 1 ratio. The author claims to have measured the backswing to downswing ratio of many tour pros, and he claims when they are winning they have a 3 to 1 ratio."
4,Tempo = pace and timing,"Novosel's book makes an excellent point about how having good tempo in your golf swing will produce many benefits. Many golf instruction books give lip service to the concept of tempo, but I don't think anybody has ever explained it like this before and provided a rhythm track for you to practice with. He debunks the old saw about ""swing slow"" or ""slow down your swing"" etc. and shows how a slow swing actually allows a lot of counterproductive and inefficient movements to creep into your swing. When you swing with good consistent tempo every time, as do most PGA players, you improve the efficiency of your swing and you improve the likelihood of hitting the ball the same way every time. Of course, you have to have decent swing mechanics as well, and this book does not purport to teach mechanics."
4,The Technical Approach To Tempo,"Everyone knows that if you want to play well, you need good tempo. But until now, no one could really define good tempo. It's totally subjective. But Novosel and Garrity break it all down for you, and explain exactly what good tempo sounds like.The ratios get a little too technical for me, but anything that gets a player's mind off the mechanics of the golf swing is a good thing. And I love the audio aspect of it. I have no doubt that this program could help your game if you stick with it, and ingrain the right tempo."
4,Serious and Provocative Info and Value,"I found the research and conclusions of this short but compelling book extremely interesting. They are of very serious potential value for a golfer who is too wound up with swing thoughts or technique, although translating the information into a ""Tour Tempo"" swing is not as easy as it looks or sounds. Since it comes with a DVD, it has actual practice value as well as information. I think understanding of what tempo the pros use when they are hitting the ball well can help a significant percentage of would-be serious golfers. I am a 60 plus avid golfer with a 14 handicap."
2,IT'S NOT A SECRET,"I don't trust anyone that obviously overstates their case. They claim to have discovered through video analysis, ""golfs final secret"". What secret?In his book ""Four Magic Moves"" Joe Dante says of the backswing and downswing, ""These two segments of the swing can be accurately timed by a motion-picture camera, by the simple process of counting the number of pictures the camera takes during each segment. Such a count shows that the backswing of a good player takes almost exactly twice as long as the downswing."" This book was published in the early 1960s.If you have never heard of this concept, this book will help you. My recommendation is to buy ""Four Magic Moves"". It's a classic and it discusses the same concept of tempo in one chapter and has 10 more chapter of good advice for your golf swing."
3,SO SO,"I found that the audio part was hard to do. I have a very quick swing already so I could not go much faster on the audio tape. I felt like i actually had to slow down my swing. which in turn cause me to hit pulled shots. I'm a 5 hcp., but after the audio, i shot two rounds 89, 91. not so good.the article in golf maz. had the drills which was the only good part about the book"
1,It's the gimmick of the week,"I am a 13 handicap. I bought the book, did the exercises and then shot my worst round in several years. In my opinion this is a gimmick along the lines of swing trainers, swing magic, medicus, natural golf, AJ on golf etc... Will you be lucky enough to have one of these gimmicks turn you into a better golfer overnight? Probably not. But lucky for you if you are.There is very little information in this book. You can get all the substantive info. out of it in 30 minutes, maybe less. I suggest at least looking at the book in a bookstore before you buy it. You have to buy the book to get the CD, but I'm not sure it's worth it."
3,What might have been.,I CAN ONLY GIVE THE BOOK 3 STARS FROM MY OWN POINT OV VIEW. THE SLOW BACKSWING HAS BEEN INGRAINED FOR SO MANY YEARS THAT I GOULD NOT SPEED UP THAT MUCH.I HAVEHAD MY SWING VIDEOTAPED AND COMPARED TO A PRO. GOLFER AND IT LOOKED SURPRISINGLY SIMILAR BUT THE SHOTS WERE VERY DIFFERENT.I KNEW SOMETHING WAS MISSING.TEMPO WAS THE THING I BELIEVE. IF I WAS AN ASPIRING GOLFER THEN I WOULD GIVE IT 5 STARS AND I APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR HIS WORK IN DISCOVERING THE FACTS.WELL DONE.
2,Very Limited Worth,"Come on, are you really going to believe that if you match a timing ratio in your golf swing you will be a better golfer? That's like believing that my Sieko can be a Rolex as long as it keeps the same time. A bad swing with good tempo may be better than bad all around, but a good swing is the only way to really improve. My advice is to skip this 150 page short story and find a full swing improvement book that addresses more than one minor aspect of the golf swing."
1,What a Crock,"Absolutely the worst. 2/3 of the ""MINI SIZE BOOK"" is devoted to the subject that no one teaches TEMPO. No kidding. The other third is back to basics with the triangle take away of hands arms and shoulder-- TEMPO? and then a CD that makes you swing as if you were on speed with beep, beep, beep, sounds. What a waste of money."
1,It's like reading the web version...,It's like reading the web version... Except you have to pay 13 dollars for it!
5,"Great stuff, but Vols 1 - 12 were better","This book is great and a very funny read. If you enjoyed ""Our Dumb Century"" you will love this. I think though that Volumes 1 through 12 were a bit better though. :-)GC"
4,Great characters,"Great characters and good story lines, easy to follow from beginning to end! Strong ending and worth the time to read"
2,"Very, Very Dated","Although the dialogue is terrific and snappy, the plot is pointless and kind of ludicrous. Also, this one shows its age."
4,Must-have book for serious Indy 500 memorabilia collectors,All of the Indy Review books are a valuable addition to any Indianapolis 500 memorabilia collection. The color photographs in this book are fantastic. This book makes for a good coffee-table book but you may want to put your book in a cabinet for protection.
2,Too old to run well on today's computers,"This product looked like it would be a lot of fun, but it may simply be too old to run well on today's computers.It's not anyone's fault - the program was written for Windows 95 and windows 3.1, long before modern PC operating systems like Windows XP or Windows Vista were even being conceived.As such, this program runs very poorly on my 5 year old Windows XP system, even in Windows 95 compatibility mode. Frequent crashes, lock ups, and audio glitches make this all but unusable.It's a shame, because what I can see of the program looks like it could be great. Your mileage may vary, but I'd recommend waiting until Disney Interactive Studio's comes up with a new version before buying this. (You could always shoot them an email to encourage this, as this will probably stay on the back burner unless they start hearing some requests.)"
1,"Check the facts man, check the facts!","This is one book you should probably just skip. The Auther has a problem with correct, as well as, accepted terminology. The book does not flow from page to page, you end up flipping back to the previous page to see if you skipped something. Information given on some picture captions is just plain wrong, and information given as fact is often the Author's opinion. The Author spends most of the book quoting other people, most notably Adrian Gilbert. If you want a good book to read, skip the quotes and just get Adrian Gilbert's book."
1,Lots of Pictures little worthwhile information,"As per my subject...Great photos, but the commentary leaves a lotto be desired. In my humble opinion, this book should be passed up, and the money saved put into a better book."
2,Interesting but disappointing,"Design, editing and content are sloppy. (I have the St. Martin's Press edition, ISBN: 0-312-26098-9.) The insertion of quotations and insets is clumsy; as a result, the text doesn't flow smoothly from one page to the next. Also, sentences are repeated and sometimes cut off altogether (see the end of page 16 and the beginning of page 17; the sentence at the end of page 17 is incomplete as is the final one on page 124.) Perhaps the British edition by Spellmount Ltd. is free of these flaws, but I haven't seen it. Some of the insets containing specifications of sniping rifles are not even accompanied by a diagram of the firearm -- a major omission in my view. Since I know nothing about this topic, I can't suggest an alternative publication, but I'm in no doubt that this one just doesn't pass muster."
1,2nd as bad as the 1st,"I have to agree with the other reviews I have read about this book. The first was not worth reading, it is too bad he wrote it again. Mr. Peter Brookesmith should stick to writing his fantasy books."
1,The Best On Breton?,"Is this the best on Breton? Last summer while vacationing in the South of France I discovered a goldmine of Breton biographies in a quaint, if not somewhat musty, used bookstore. Most were in French, and since I don't speak French, I had them translated. Guess what, they opened my eyes to the Breton most silly Americans don't see, and for that matter, I hope they never see. Breton is simply not meant to be understood by Americans. Thank God I moved to France shortly after this review."
3,A New Generations Big Chill,This movie is worth a watch! A group of young friends are vacationing in a summer house when tragedy strikes and a character is killed in a car crash. The remaining friends come together to mourn and heal as they remember their friend and the effect she had on them. Enter the lost daughter's mother (Diane Keaton) who joins them to help her heal and to learn a side to her daughter's past she didn't know. Good performances from the entire cast and sweet relationships make it a good movie.
3,"good, then bad","The first five hundred pages, give or take, read like they were written by China Miéville and William Gibson's lovechild. This is a wonderful thing. Unfortunately, the last hundred pages feel like Simon R. Green was brought in to write the ending. For those of you who aren't familiar, that means the ending just kind of craps out. Sad under any circumstances - tragic in this case."
3,"As frenetic as a Hindi music video, and just as unsatisfying","I personally have a academic background in Indian history and culture, but I could not maintain interest in this spastic hodge-podge of characters and meandering (or lack of) plot. I waded through over 200 pages of tedium before giving up. Interesting concepts without cohesion. It may have garnered a Hugo, but it came off as an ornately-decorated Yugo.As stylish as a hand-illustrated Gita, admittedly, but no substance that I could ascertain. Your mileage may vary."
3,Not that good,"I've got to say that I read the reviews, and saw the ratings score up there with this book and thought I'd give it a try. And that's where I went wrong.It's not that this is a terrible novel. It's just that you REALLY, REALLY have to work at reading this book. You start out having to skip to the glossary at the back of the book to figure out what half of the words in Hindi mean. So, after you start jumping back and forth for a while, you have to get used to the author jumping back and forth with his characters. Yes, there are a lot as the other reviewers mention. And yes, they overlap and intertwine. That part of the novel is interesting. As is the setting and the times.I thought the end was worth the ride. Was it completely work the effort it took to get to the end? It wasn't in my opinion. But you might have a different read than mine. Certainly there are enough readers who loved this book. Me, I just thought too much effort for just an ok plot line."
3,Good tale needs editing,"This is a good tale but needs editing for length and language, especially language. The author uses Hinglish in such quantities that it is not unusual to find a sentence with two or even three words unintelligible to the non-Indian reader. This interferes with basic comprehension, flow, and enjoyment of the story. In other words, the technique is distracting from the story, which violates the first principle of successful fiction writing."
4,Grows on you,"When I first started to read River of Gods, I made it about 5 chapters in, gave up, and gave the book a 2 star rating on Amazon. It's a very difficult book to get into. Part of this is because of the disjointed narrative that skips between seemingly unrelated characters for about the first 3rd of the book. Part of it is because McDonald's ""future vernacular"" gets almost no explanation and makes the writing difficult to follow at times. For instance aeai=AI=artificial intelligence and yt=it=third person singular for a gender neutral person. These terms are interwoven with not just regular English but Indian terms as well, which can make the book maddeningly incomprehensible at times.Thankfully though, I returned to the book several months later. The seemingly disparate plot lines eventually intertwine, and by the second part of the book the vernacular starts to fall into place. And what you begin to see is a future world of extra-ordinary vision and creativity."
2,Too many plot lines,"Given the excellent reviews, I had great hopes for this book. I was, however, disappointed.I can appreciate a book with multiple plot lines, but in this book there were simply too many. And since the plot lines was (at least up to where I gave up) unrelated, and since there were so many people to keep apart, it was difficult to follow.Some of the plot lines were very dull and did not engage me at all. I only found two of the plot lines interesting.I believe that if this book is read over a couple of days, the plot lines would be easier to follow."
1,hard to get into,"Found it very hard to get into this book. Very long. Looking at the cover art, I ws hopeing for more scifi."
4,12 Angry Men,"Good presentation of the movie. There was a great deal of background material and information about the production and the historical context on the DVD. I would recommend to read the Wikipedia page on the film to receive an alternative view of the film since it is a liberal product.Overall, it was, from a techincal and dramatic point of view, excellent. The weak part was the story line was contrived to lead you to believe the defendant was clearly guilty and then reveal flaws in the jury and police procedures.I like the film production and will keep it but I will not watch it soon again since I disagree with its message."
4,Great film,"I heard about this film after seeing the recent Russian film entitles ""12."" A film professor told me this was the original film and one of the best structured films ever to come out of Hollywood. It was good for sure, but was not a holy grail that I had been led to believe. It is certainly wonderful to see all those veteran film actors from their younger years."
4,Understanding Lillian Hellman,"Now I understand better the works of Lillian Hellman - her plays and memoirs. The authors put the plays into the context of their times but also show how they are timely today. It really sheds light on the memoirs, great reading, and explains the book Maybe, a puzzle now made clear."
