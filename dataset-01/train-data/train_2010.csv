2,"Back, posture support","i received the product but it is way too tight. I measured according to the directions before I bought it, and ordered a medium. When it arrived, I put it on, according to the directions, and wore it for 30 minutes. During that time, I could hardly breath and I got a sore above my left hipbone which later developed into a bruise about 3"" across with a partial scab.I'm afraid I have to send it back to possibly get a larger size, or get my money back. This one was just too tight and uncomfortable. Do I send it back to Amazon or the manufacturer? What if the next one doesn't work, will I get my money back?I'm sorry, but I had great expectations, but the product made me feel as if I would have a heart attack and I had to take it off right away. I just couldn't breath."
2,Don't like it,It is so itchy on my shoulders that I can not use it. Needs to wear with an under shirt!
5,Orca Whale Mailbox,"Received in a timely manner, in tact, and was easily assembled and looks great, purchased as a gift and was very much appreciated."
4,A twisted family will never let love die,"House of yes was so different from what I expected. It was brilliant but really sick, and I apprecitaed that. While reading it and later watching the movie I wondered if the author ever knew anyone in her life that represented the character Jackie O. She was so perfect and I loved her. If the author ever reads this I want you to know that your writing in this case (first of your work I have read) was unique and I wanted more! Alexis Rain"
3,Not as I expected,I saw the film with Parker Posey and bought the script with the hope to find some more details. But the film was in every way better and the script alone can not stand at the height of the film.
2,Too Much Talk,"Unless you can understand French, or are buying this for the performance of Minor Swing only, don't bother. It's mostly talk (in French) and the subtitles are not readable most of the time. I was hoping for more music. If you do buy it, don't get thrown by the previews at the beginning. The menu doesn't appear until later. We thought we had mistakenly received the wrong DVD."
3,Driver Issues in XP,"I love the mechanical feel of this controller. It feels like the volume knob on a high-end audio component -- only bigger. From the weight to the click and rotation action, it's a pleasure to work with.The blue LED is a nice touch.Unfortunately, I'm having Windows XP SP2 issues with it. Despite having followed their instructions to ""automatically"" install it, and then their instructions on ""manually"" updating the driver, it just doesn't work on my Dell desktop. It's recognized as an HID-compatible device, but it won't accept Griffin's drivers.I'm in the middle of a discussion with Griffin over e-mail, and I'll update this area. Unfortunately they only reply after 3-4 business days (!). Installation issues + bad customer service warrant the minus two stars. Hopefully others aren't having the same problems and this negative review will be dilluted."
5,West 32,One of my favorite albums of all time with a huge array of talented musicians. CE really is one of the all time organ greats.
1,Picture is WRONG!! NO SWIVEL BASE!!!,"The vise may be OK, but what actually ships does not have the swivel base that's shown in the picture. For Pete's sake show the right picture!!! We innocently ordered this thinking that it was exactly what we wanted and now we have to return it and get the Palmgren 18602 Model 610B which actually has the swivel base."
5,Drafting and Design for Architecture by Donald Hepler,"A very good helping hand to students. covers a very broad range of topics such as architectural history (brief summary only), drafting materials, rendering, site planning."
2,too soft,"This pillow works well, but is a little soft. I ended up buying a boppy body pillow, which I loved!"
5,Best Pregnancy Pillow!,I am so happy that I purchased this pillow. It has greatly helped my back pain and supports all the neccessary areas for pregnancy. I have grown very attached to it and think that I might have difficulty abandoning it after the baby is born!
3,Pillow is ok.,"The pillow is ok. It's more convenient to stuff all over my bed with pillows. However, I wish they make a smaller size for petites and I'm not able to have a lot of back support with my small frame. Also, I agree with the reviews online that the pillow cover is not the easiest thing to put in, definitely not a ""snap on."" On the plus side, it's the perfect back support if you sit up to watch TV, read books etc."
2,Quite expensive for what it is...,"I bought the Snoogle for my pregnant wife and she likes it. I thought it was pretty overpriced for what it is...and odd shaped pillow that is lesser quality than the average pillow at Wal-mart, Linens and things or wheverever. It doesn't have much stuffing and should probably cost half as much money."
3,"Not the most well written book,but I live in Boise so it was interesting","I live in Boise so I am familiar with the places in the book. I also know several of the people mentioned in the book. The judge married a family member. I attend St. Michael's. It was because of those things that it was something I wanted to read. Robin Row is so despicable that it makes you sick. The book is not that well written,but it was interesting. What a terrible thing she did to her children and husband. If you like true crime books you will like this. It is not Ann Rule,but it is a true story."
5,"If you love true crime books, this is one of the best you will read.","This book is superb in every way. The author obviously went out of her way to be objective and obtain the correct details and facts. It won the BOOK OF THE YEAR AWARD. They do NOT hand out these awards out freely to someone who writes a poor book. See that here:[...]It is a true and horrifying outsider's view into heart of a sociopath's world. I could not put it down. It was an excellent read. If you love true crime stories, you will definitely love this book. I hope we get to read more great books from this author. It is a gem."
5,Read from Cover to Cover in One Day!,"I'd read about these murders in our local newspaper, so thought it would be a boring rehash. Wow, was I wrong!!! I started reading & couldn't put it down. The author gets inside murderer Robin Row's head & gave me insight into her ""con-man"" anti-social mind. I was fascinated and horrified to learn that Robin Row had gotten away with murder before & left a long trail of arson, fraud and betrayals. Nancy Whitmore Poore has researched her subject well and gives a chillingly accurate portrayal of a cold-hearted murderer. A must read for anyone interested in true crime."
2,"Good Idea, but didn't work for us.","I ordered this for my 1 year old baby after weaning her off of her Nap Nanny for night time use. She was diagnosed with GERD as a newborn and we were told to switch her to a pillow when she turned one. I found this pillow and thought it would be great due to the fact she could feel something all around her like she had been used to with the Nap Nanny. Maybe as she ages she will use it, but as of now she will not. She moves to the opposite side of the crib from where it is.I also wish that the cover zipped on and off so that it was easier to wash.I do feel like I can reintroduce this pillow to her at a later time and she will use it- possibly when she's in her toddler bed."
5,Sirius Radio Car Kit,Needed flexibility to use my Sirius satellite radio in more than one vehicle. I had trouble locating the car adapter kit but finally found it on Amazon. The price was reasonable. I received my order quickly. I installed the adapter and now am able to use my radio in three different cars.
1,"Blatant Disregard for the FACTS, the Statistics and the TRUTH",How on earth has this author succeeded in getting a book published that is so completely contemptuous of the facts.78% of men who ask for sole or joint custody get it. 12% of women do.This man should be banned from publishing such biased trash.
3,Just enough,"There's just enough vocabulary to ask someone, ""who speaks English?"" The book is small enough for a pocket, and if you'e doing the Central Europe loop that is recommended by the Lonely Planet Central Europe Guidebook, this should fulfill your basic language requirements for all these countries. The phonetic pronunciation guide left me a little confused, so I looked up some key words with online audio, where native speakers pronounce the words. Then I made little notes in the margin. My experience is that there is little hope that the natives with understand my version of their language, and no hope that I will understand their version of their language. Thus phrasebooks in general are a waste, except to find someone willing to converse in English (very unPC). The most inexpensive offer was from a bookstore in the UK. The price was right, but it took 2 weeks to arrive in the mail."
1,A skewed interpretation. Very Biased!,This book presents data and historical facts of psychology in a very skewed manner. The writter seems to be completely in love with several theories in Cognitive Psychlogy and ignores information which contradicts or places serious doubt on his interpretation of experiments and theories.I would recommend that no one use this book for instructional purposes. There are several other Cognitive Psychology books that stick to the facts or at least are more objective.
3,so bnoring,"so boring, so so boring to read and follow.. they knew about cog psyc, but forget how to communicate the information appropriately."
5,The content is as wonderful as the art!,"What a beautiful book, I thought. I could see it on my coffee table or as a gift for a friend, but then I read it. Wow! A beautiful book with insightful writing and content. Cindy has provided a book that quilters will love, that will make a wonderful gift for friends, and a keepsake for those who love to read good writing."
2,I Like Watching Interesting Documentaries,"The premise is promising: an avuncular, crotchety-but-lovable hash slinger (Kenny Shopsin) is being squeezed out of his beloved kitchen by greedy New York landlords and developers. And Kenny's musings on how New York's soul is being devoured by real-estate moguls are indeed interesting. Unfortunately, he has much more to say about a lot of other things, very little of which makes much sense except to him. The movie ends up being the worst thing a documentary can be: uninteresting.I've eaten at Shopsin's a couple of times, and there's nothing charming about it. The food's decent, but the family is boorish and rude, and not in some quaint, lovable way. Kenny Shopsin is repulsive. This film is a good example of how art can make reality look a million times more appetizing than it is."
2,"Effective Translation, Disappointing Scholarship","Although Niyazi Berkes does bring to English significant works of the most prolific Young Turk, this work is disappointing. The dates and names of publications where Ziya Gokalp's essays were originally printed are not listed. This translation makes it impossible to compare the content of the Turkish nationist's ideas with the historical conditions at the time. Readers do not know when or where the essays were read or what may have prompted the writing. Much more scholarship of this kind needs to be done. Compared to other regions of the world, there is a dearth of translation from great Turkish authors."
1,Waste of my time,"This was so slow, it took 20 chapters to get to the crime and the solving of that crime. This book wasted the first 20 chapters on the simpering feelings of poor Bay Tanner and her sad memories of her dead husband and having to leave her new special man, who is still recovering from his poor wounds but goes off in service to Interpol. This endless exploration of Bay Tanner's (so tender and confused) feelings is not what I look for in a crime novel."
5,Larsen/Feiten Band,"An underrating band, which there were more of them and that they were still together making CD's. Great CD."
2,A Disappointment,"I really enjoy the music of Neil Larsen and purchased this CD unheard. There is only one song that is strictly Larsen and it is great. The rest of the album is enjoyable, but not so memorable or special. I wish Neil Larsen would do another solo album."
1,FULL MOON,"i SAW THIS BAND IN IT'S ORIGINAL FORM, PLAY AT THE WOODSTOCK PLAYHOUSE WHEN i WAS A KID.tHEY BLEW ME AWAY.For some reason I never picked up the LP.Now I find, that CD's are like 50 bucks.The same thing happened with another woodstock based album,Happy and Artie TRaum.This album is huge bucks if you can find it.Since the masters obviously exist somewhere, why are CD's so expensive?"
1,Counterfeit Blades,"Ran out of my Mach 3's and finally got around to ordering some here after seeing the price at Walmart, etc. When I tried the first one I couldn't believe how badly it pulled the hair on my face. Figured they were bad. Well... just happened to find a couple blades I never used from my old case. Put one in and WHOA, what a difference. I got online and typed in ""counterfeit razor blades"". Check for yourself. Don't buy these. Shame on Amazon if they continue to allow this seller to use them."
2,Hard to predict...,"Needed new razors and figured I would get cheaper ones from Amazon. I had read a lot of reviews warning about inconsistencies and the potentials of getting an item that was genuine.From my set of razors received, the first one I used was rough to shave with. You could feel it coarsely going as you tried to shave and the lubricating strips didn't seem to do a thing. For a 5-count, to have even just one blade shave rough is not great... The second blade I used was definitely better, yet still nowhere as smooth as store-bought replacements.I'm deciding that perhaps the safest thing to do is to buy replacements directly from the store.."
1,worst ever,"these were the worst razor blades I have ever purchased anywhere!Even when in the U S. Army nearly 40 years ago the Gillette blue blades that had been packed in the 1940's and were 30 years old were better than these Mach 3 turbo.When I contacted P&G; they responded 10 days later they were unable to confirm the type of blades I purchased.If Amazon.com would be kind to forward this information to P&G; I would be very happy.David UpdykeCorpus Christi,TexasGillette Mach3 Turbo-Gillette Refill Cartridges, 5ct (2 Pack)"
1,Horrible razors,My husband usually loves these razors but he tried every single one of the 20 we bought and he said they all hurt his face.
2,Fakes? Faulty? Definitely useless.,"Just to echo the number of other reviews which have unfortunately surfaced just after I decided to go for this item, two of the four packs of 5 blades were completely unuseable. The other two were fine. My seller was probably disreputable, and doesn't appear to be listed under the used and new at the moment, but there's nothing to stop them re-appearing under a new name in the future.So, unfortunately for those reputable Amazon sellers trying to offer blades at a lower price, I've given up on buying blades online.I've also recently tried the Gillette Fusion razor, and it feels like a substantial improvement over the Mach3, which I had been happy with for years. Maybe try an upgrade!"
2,Go for the 642DVP,My Philips 642DVP is AWESOME! It plays EVERYTHING! And it's easy to hack and make region free. Only 10 bucks more.
1,It Is A Single Disc Player NOT A Five Disc Player,"While this may be an ideal choice for a single disc player, it was advertised as a ""5-Disc Progressive Scan DVD Player"". Please be aware of this fact and if you are looking for a 5 disc player, this is not it."
1,Won't read discs!,"This dvd player failed to recognize all copied dvds I made. The box clearly states that this dvd player will play DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD+R, DVD+RW. Well, I tried both -R and -RW types. Bad disc message is all that I received. No recognition of anything I had recorded. So, I went and put both DVDs into my panasonic dvd player and they played great. I would say stay away from this dvd player."
4,"Great, slimline player!","I picked up this player because I have a 5"" LCD that I wanted to set up with a nice, slim DVD player in my Toyota Rav4 so that the kids can watch DVDs in the backseat when we're on the road. I look at some Cyberhome and Oritron units that were smaller, but the reviews on them were mostly horrible, with usually 2-3 people with 4-5 stars and 70-80 with 1-2 stars. For $10 more, I thought the DVD622/37 would be a great deal. It fits under the driver's seat in my car perfectly, and so far it's played all the DVD-R and DVD+R discs I've thrown at it. I would say for $10 more, it would be crazy to pass not this unit in favor of an Oritron or Cyberhome, which seem to have a lifespan of 2-12 months."
4,Great price. Great entry-level DVD player,"I have to admit I am impressed by the negative comments I have read about this product. Yuo all must have received a defective unit or just got unlucky with it. I got this DVD at JC Penney on sale for $29.95 in August 2006 because I needed a new cheap DVD player with progressive scan. Then I come to find out that this DVD player has both NTSC and PAL which is great for me that I watch movies from Italy. I already had one Sampo DVD region free to dothis but I searched online to see if I could unlock this Philips. Found it. After pressing 8 buttons this cheap DVd player plays anything I feed him with. It does play PC recorded DVDs too. Its menu is easy to use and so its remote. The progressive scan picture looks great on my 50"" Panasonic plasma. And all for $29.95."
5,MUST READ FOR SUCCESS,"Divided into three convenient parts, Architect's Essentials of Marketing is extremely informative and easily digestible. Part I: Marketing Strategy, Part II: The Business Development Cycle, Part III: Marketing Tools and Resources.Similar to the best professors I had in college, author, David Koren is passionate and to the point. The material is presented in a well-written, upbeat and positive tone. Explanation of major points is supported by easy-to-understand tables and diagrams. In addition to the valuable insights found in the main text, margins throughout the book are packed with short thought provoking sidebars.Architect's Essentials of Marketing is a must-read for any individual or firm serious about building long-term success. Heck, this book would help professionals in any field."
1,Ethnocentric Victorian transcript of classic sources,"This book doesn't add much more knowledge about the life of Belisarius than what can be obtained from classical sources. However, it might be interesting for the reader studying the ethnocentric views of the Victorian backbencher who wrote it.The book is peppered with allusions to ""north versus south"" and ""west versus east"", the former being always simple, frugal, booming, manly, while the latter being degenerate, decadent, jealous.In particular the Italians, according to the author, didn't produce a thing of value since classical Roman times, aside, of course, of those northern Italians of non-Mediterranean descent.My advice for those looking for an introductory text on Belisarius: read ""the Count Bellisarius"" novel by Robert Graves. Although some facts are inaccurate, it presents more information than this book, but in a more entertaining way and without the arrogance."
5,Daughter is digging the Remo Club Bongos,"These are sturdy and have a decent sound. I like the rubber feet on the bottom so my daughter can play them on the floor - although she likes to put themm in her lap. Like most people have said, I didn't expect a studio-quality sound. She still prefers my tabla, but she only gets to play that with daddy. This is her ""drum!"". As far as small pieces: keep the wingnuts tight and you're good. No sharp corners llike some of the entry level bongos I was looking at."
4,kids bongons,"i have bongos, and my baby wants to play then all the time so, i got her, hers. She LOVE them"
2,Poor sound quality,We are not happy with the sound quality and wish we paid more for a nicer set...our toddler doesn't seem to mind though.
3,bongo drum,I assumed my toddler son would love these drums because he loves music and hitting stuff. He does not dislike them. But he rarely plays with them. They have held up extremely well to his attempts to dismantle them. He does unscrew the thumbscrew that holds them together. Overall I think it's a well made toy. Just not whatever it is that my toddler is looking for. I think it would have been perfect for my musical daughters when they were little...
1,bongo drum,not great sound. we also bought the bigger drum that is amazing but this one is really hard to get much sound out of it. wouldn't recommend it.
3,Well constructed but only so-so sound,"I like Remo drums. They make well-constructed drums at reasonable prices for all ages and uses. So I was hoping these inexpensive bongos would work well as spares for our drum circle, for adults or kids who don't bring their own percussion. But I've just received them today and found that when they are held between the knees, the sound is somewhat dull or deadened. I doubt that they will be loud enough in a drum circle to be satisfying (though for the price and Remo construction, they were worth a try).I'd say if you have a young child who you want to encourage to play drums at home, these may still be a good choice because they will hold up well and are priced reasonably (and maybe because the sound isn't sharp enough to drive the rest of the family crazy). But if you want a half-way decent bongo sound these are probably not the best choice."
4,Wrong color sent! !!!,"*Update: Amazon called me and made everything right. They made sure I had a present for my daughter on her birthday. They are still black bongos, though.I gave this 4 stars because I think it is a good product, but I'm not happy with amazon right now. I ordered this specific set of bongos because the picture showed blue trimmed bongos and that is the color my daughter requested for her birthday. However, bongos with black trim arrived. Amazon offered to refund my money, but did not offer to send me the blue ones by my daughters birthday. They wanted me to place the order again and I would have to pay expedited shipping if I wanted it by my daughters birthday. I didn't think this was fair since it wasn't my fault. I had to keep the black just so my daughter had a present on her birthday. Upsetting! *see update*"
2,Bores my 3 Year Old,"We bought this for my 3 year old on his birthday. He has a small wooden drum set that he likes a lot, so I thought this would go over just as well. Wrong. He's totally bored with it. The noise is not distinctive -- he might as well be beating on an oatmeal canister. Take a pass."
3,Drums for our son!!,"For some reason our son barely 21 months loves to bang in things and while he is at it, he sings as well. So I figured let me buy him a drum, he bang on the drum but it isn't the effects he is used to, I keep telling just keep playing your music with you drum and not on the wall, he will indeed do pick up the drum and start playing his music! Interesting right,he loves the sounds and effects he gets from the drum. Thanks again for an awesome price and the drum!"
3,"Good construction, disappointing sound","We bought these bongos for our son's birthday. They seem to be of good quality, the only complaint is the sound isn't very good. My husband plays all different sorts of drums, and we were both disappointed with the fact that they don't sound very bongo-like, and the two different drums hardly make a different sound. Luckily they weren't very expensive, so I guess you get what you pay for!"
4,Lessons in Living,"Light, easy reading. Good for that time right before falling asleep in bed because the islands and people Janis Frawley describes are sunny and happy and relaxed and the advice she gives is good and hopeful. It makes for some good dreaming.(Only one negative- the author overuses the word ""venerable"")."
2,Few snippets here and there.,"There are just few pages about every island, from very north to very south of the globe. Just a few new or interesting facts about any of them. You are not going to learn anything about beaches on St. Lucia, or night bars in Cuba. I am not sure author ever went to those islands."
3,Chamberlain is great the book is dull,"It has been several years since I read Soul of the Lion. However, although the Civil War years of Chamberlain are quite interesting and alive, the rest of the book is quite dull. Chamberlain's remaining days in Maine and Florida are just not very interesting reading. I attribute most of this to Wallace's weakness as a writer."
5,Soul,Outstanding reading. I have had the priviledge of actually going to his home in Maine. Very interesting and very informative
3,the good and the bad,"the mouse is great when it's new, never had a complaint, looks great, works great... and then the same old scroll ball slow death everyone all over the internet is describing, and eventually you're looking for another mouse... while you could switch to another brand, you have to bear in mind you lose features like the recognition of buttons other than left/right click and the battery level feedback, so while this mouse lasted almost two years, and frustrates you to have to put down another $70 to replace when the scrolling finally quits for good, just remember not to waste your money on people trying to sell you this same $70 mouse for $100 or even $120 like some of the people out there, even BestBuy couldn't find a way to mark this thing up to $100 and their prices suck compared to Amazon most days"
2,Unresponsive and connection is dodgy,"I would LOVE to LOVE this mouse. In typical Apple fashion, it's elegantly designed. The scroll ball is a joy to use. The left/right click functionality works flawlessly - and without using buttons. So what's not to like?1) Dialing in the response in System Preferences right up to the max still gets you only so-so responsiveness. (There is aftermarket software that can help with this, but you shouldn't have to go there.)2) Connection drop after connection drop. Alternatively, a brief delay in your system picking up the mouse after not using it for a while.Those are deal killers. Replaced! - with a Logitech mouse."
1,Don't Bother,"If you were thinking of getting this game, don't. The time I spent trying to play it is time of my life that I will sadly never get back.There is no tutorial. Reading the instructions helps, but not enough. The pre-battle instructions tell you what move you must do to win the fight, but do not tell you how to do said move. If you ""win"" the fight without using said move, it will say you lost."
2,Elvira's back....but the movies are censored,The movies on this DVD are not uncut and are edited for television. Prior Elvira DVDs had uncut versions of the movies so I was disapointed by the versions of the films on here. The segments by Elvira are still funny and entertaining however.
4,Practical And Thought-provoking,"From the back jacket of the book reads "" This book provides a structured way to think about innovation and gives practical examples of how individuals are doing it. ""In my opinion, this book offers more!My first reaction to this book is a sense of excitement: the author actually sets aside generous amount of space for readers to write their thoughts. This is very thoughtful as this book bring exciting concepts that enthralls and demands a second reading. Note-taking is a must.I am also impressed by way Chapter 1 handles ""Catalysts of Change"". This concept is very complex and dynamic: however, Wolfgang handles it expertly.Chapter 9's Strategic Thinking and Strategic Action provides leaders and decision-makers the necessary tools to conceptualise their corporate strategy. I am amazed by the simplicity of presentation.This book is a must read for all who want a grasp of developing an innovative mind..."
4,Tough appraisal of 'Asian miracle',"This is a solid book and an entertaining read. The author is not particularly profound in his analysis, but at least he is not just another neo-liberal ideologue. He understands that business is embedded in wider society, and that this fact fundamentally influences the business culture. I especially liked the portraits of major players, and the other telling details. Overall, not really deep, but an interesting coverage of Asia's economic woes."
5,A very important book for anyone doing business in Asia.,"In addition to providing important background on Asian thought and how it differs from Western concepts, this books explains the many hazards of doing business in Asia. Anyone buying stocks, making loans, making contracts, or forming joint ventures in Asia needs to read this book first and be better prepared to take the plunge. To be forewarned is to be forearmed."
1,Expect this one in the discount bin soon.,"This book is merely an anthology of tall-tales and tittle-tattle dressed up as a serious reference book. He recounts scandal after scandal and attributes them to something dark and nebulous called 'culture'. He makes curious comparisons with Western 'culture' (the headlight story above, and the 'do unto others' theory so eloquently and quickly debunked by Frank Ching in the Far Eastern Economic Review') without a single mention of thousands of western business scandals, not least in Backman's own country, where, during the 1980s, there was a string of scandals involving businessmen like Christopher Skase and Alan Bond. They weren't Asian, but quite readily scooted off with millions of dollars of other people's money. Backman has clearly researched and written this book with a set of conclusions already in mind, namely, Asians are innately devious and slippery. Save your money and your time. Give this book a miss."
1,Just another western book keen on Asian Bashing.,"The author seemed to be more keen on bashing the Asians rather than really exposing the dark side. The book seemed to be focused on comparing Asian economic system with the Westerns' and let the reader know how much superior western people are. That seems to be the primary objective of the author.While the stories about the way they corrupt seem interesting, but continuos comparisons with the west just don't help make the story more intersting.It's just plainly annoying to read. Why didn't the author just go ahead telling the stories on how they corrupt and stop comparing Asia with the Westerners? Those are all the information I need. We don't need a writer to glorify us in this way.Since he is from Australia, and that Australian are known to be anti-Asians, one piece of advice for Mr. Backman: Get to know them(Asians), don't be so engulfed with your racial bias. Maybe you can write a better book next time."
5,johnny lee country party,l just want to say l recieved my product in good shape and plays well thank you to cds4sale
5,A Must for Carolinian Cooks,"If you are from South Carolina and you love southern cooking, then you should have The Carolina Housewife in your kitchen. It is fascinating to learn what SCarolinians were eating in the nineteenth century. Spend an evening in the past having a nineteenth-century meal! Learn how to make your own mayonnaise, ginger beer, hommony, etc. The University of South Carolina Press should be commended for keeping this book in print. Perhaps they will consider a paperback edition in the future."
5,An excellent book!,"Hi! I'm a Reiki practitioner.This book is very well researched and is a must read for all Reiki practitioners and Masters.It shows the connection between Reiki and the Healing Buddha. For example, the Reiki Master symbol is actually ""hidden"" within the vows of the Healing Buddha! Another interesting fact is that the two Bodhisattvas assisting the healing Buddha are called ""Bright Sun"" and ""Bright Moon"", the names of which if combined together gives you a significant portion of the Reiki Master symbol.There is also an indepth discussion on the ""hidden"" meanings of the traditional Mikao Usui's background and story...etc. Lastly, there is also much explanation of the Reiki symbols and their background and uses.What are you waiting for? GRAB THIS BOOK NOW!"
2,Made from stickers.,"We just got this puzzle. So far it looks really cute, but I'm really disappointed to see that the pictures are actually just stickers stuck to the pieces of wood. I was hoping for a solid kind of puzzle that would be difficult to ruin. I have four kids, ages 4 and under... Unfortunately, I doubt this puzzle will last long."
2,board build is very poor,"Wonderful eye catching colors, alphabet chunky wooden pieces built quality is great, but the quality of the board is too poor. broken in to 2 layers with in a week, can no longer be used for playing."
1,Stops playing 5 times during a song.,From the first day I got this item from Amazon it would randomly stop. On average it stops about 5 or 6 times during one song play. I know the problem is not with my iPod because that works perfectly in other players and with headphones. I would highly recommend that you consider purchasing another product... it's not worth the hassle getting this one.
4,what we wanted,it has very clear sound quality and is very nice that your ipod charges while it's docked. the only thing we were a bit surpised with was the size - i expected it to be smaller.
4,"Great, but","This speaker system has great sound for it's compact size. It's perfect for our bedroom. The left to right separation is good and the surround sound is awesome. The only reason I gave the product 4 stars instead of 5 is it does not enable video out in the ipod touch or iphones (it does play music on our ipod touch 1g and iphone 1g and 3g). I have a 5th generation ipod video which works great, so video out is not that big of a deal, but it would be better if it could provide the same capabilities with the newer ipods. It's not really Cambridge Soundworks fault per say, but a bit of an annoyance.I would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for an affordable, portable, great sounding system who's not so concerned about video output on newer ipods."
2,Not Fully Compatible with iPod Touch 1G,I have an iPod Touch 1G 16GB. The Cambridge playdock i does not work as described on the AMAZON website for AV out-put to TV viewing with iPod Touch. After several tries connecting to different TVs. I contacted the Mfr. Creative Labs and was told the video is NOT compatible with iPod Touch units. If your only interested in sound the unit does work.
3,Research charging capabilities!,"Nice little system for the price. I highly suggest researching your ipod model for charging capabilities. I have a new ipod nano 5th gen and this unit will not charge it, just seems senseless that it really is just adding speakers to my nano and nothing else."
1,"Jim Curtin: ""Elvis, Unknown Stories behind the Legend""","This book is a total waste of time as well waste of money.This is one of the most inept writings which I have seen in a longtime. How can the writer insist that he is a friend being familiar with Elvis' ""inner circle"" if he is only a fan, though a very intense one, after having been introduced to him only in the last couple of years of Elvis' life? The writing is clumsy, juvenile, the content is not better. I give this book a Zero and no stars at all. Best to read biographies by Peter Guralnick."
5,TRULY A SUPER BOOK!,"I just can't say enough about this book. It was one of the best books on ELvis. Very informative as well as entertaining.I have Jim Curtin's other books, and all I can say about Jim is .. pure devotion! Jim puts all out with his books.This is a definite must-read for the Elvis fan!"
1,Paper Thin... bad design,If you're looking for a card game with paper thin cards that stink from cheap inks... this is the one!!!!Cards don't even have the numbers printed on both the top and bottom of card so they always have to be arranged facing up...In Go Fish... ALL the cards have ONE star on it with the numbers small at the top right of card.... so your child has to recognize the written number... there is no counting optionI'm returning these today! Save your self the trouble and get Eeboo brand cards they are the best!
1,Are these Seconds?,"I love these unsalted, roasted soynuts. Melissa makes the best. I'm giving them a bad rating because out of the 12 packages I purchased, 6 were not sealed correctly at the bottom. Like not enough pressure was exerted by the factory machine. Also, some were trimmed too close to the seam. When I opened the shipping box, loose soynuts were everywhere. What a mess! I am wondering if these packages are seconds that were singled out at the factory as not deliverable to retail grocery stores.I have trouble getting these at the local grocery store because they keep running out of stock! I almost send them back to Amazon, but too much hassle. Won't buy them again from Amazon!"
5,An non-LDS Christian's perspective,"I think Robinson presents a convincing argument for including LDS faith holders under the heading of Christians. He not arguing that the LDS perspectives falls under Protestant, Catholic, or Orthodox headings...just Christian.He also is not arguing that the LDS perspective/beliefs are correct...just that there have been other groups, who are currently categorized under the heading of Christian, who have also held some disparate opinions on some of the same issues that the LDS do.A very thought provoking read."
5,Who decides who is a Christian?,"A refreshing antidote for the self-appointed judges of who is a Christian and who is not. Robinson's argument is essentially that Mormons are Christians because that is how they view themselves, and nobody has a right to say otherwise. Too many anti-Mormon tracts seem to define Christianity so narrowly that they would exclude Jesus Christ as a Christian."
3,3.5 Stars for a neat collection,"This is a nice 3 CD set, and might be considered a nice introduction to Minimal Compact, but is probably most interesting for long time fans.You get 2 discs of archival outtakes, and remixes, and just 1 disc of ""classics"" that really feels incomplete, because it is.The 15 track ""classics"" disc feels like an incentive to buy the whole set, and it worked, because unfortunately the band's albums are all very hard to find, and out of print.I was excited when it came out, but in the long run this set just makes me wish they had reissued all the albums together with this stuff tacked on as bonus tracks.A note on the packaging: The box is very nice, solid, sturdy, and has a very nice, thick booklet, full of photos, history, and also includes complete lyrics to all the songs, on all of their albums...which is really a tease since the albums are so hard to find!"
2,Poor design,"I bought this alarm clock primarily for the cd player/alarm clock combo. The cd player has very poor sound quality. I wasn't expecting Bose quality, but the sound is muffled and the volume is difficult to adjust to an acceptable setting. The buttons on top that are used to identify the radio stations have kitschy stickers that are very difficult to apply. You must also remove the top of the clock to lock/unlock the alarm settings, and the top is very difficult to fit in place after removal (aligning the buttons and keeping them from falling off while you place the top back on is a nightmare).I would pass on this one and find another combination cd/alarm clock if that is what you are looking for."
3,DST per Timex,"Item still selling at BJ's for $39.99, but this model has not been fixed for new daylight savings auto adjustments. Was told by Timex to use Hawaii as zone, and manually adjust time at beginning and end of DST. Otherwise a great cd,MP3,alarm clock radio. 3 stars due to manual adjustment only, even on this model currently being sold anywhere."
2,Self-serving book,"I thought the first part of the book was a page-turner. But less that halfway through, I had to force myself to read it. I thought it was a self-serving book for Mr. Bugliosi. How he says ""I just can't defend a client unless I know they are innocent"" and I love how when the judge tells him he can only have a certian amount of time for his closing statement, he is sure to tell the judge (and us) how another judge thought his 13 hour closing statement was the best one he has ever heard. I'm not in the mood for an author who beefs himself up in a book. I couldn't even force myself to finish it-it was that boring! Perhaps lawyers will enjoy it since it's 99% courtroom & 1% true crime"
5,couldn't put it down,"this was one of those books that the images come alive and you feel like you are really there.i was also impressed by the proof reading of this book. every word spelled correctly,every comma in it's place.so many books are rushed that i feel like the publisher didn't take the time to correct any mistypes. i'm a vincent bugliosi fan for life now."
2,self-aggrandizing by bugliosi,"the first part of this book was interesting but it was just a set-up for three hundred pages of vincent bugliosi explaining how brilliant he is. You never come close to finding out what actually happened, possibly because he is trying to convince us of the innocence of his client. he writes a lot from the standpoint of characters who are dead and could never have shared these thoughts with anyone. So basically it is a work of fiction. I skimmed the last three hundred pages because within fifty pages of it you already had all of the facts and the rest was reiteration. with no resolution. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone"
1,grand fiction,"The femme fatale in this yarn has convinced the author that she was just an innocent passenger in the cruise of the Iola to Palmyra, the murder of Mac and Muff Graham, the theft of the Seawind, the return to Hawaii in the pirated craft, and everything else that transpired.Why did she stop to get her dog and thereby get arrested? [Huh?].After her arrest, what did she flush down the toilet in the ladies' room of the Hawaii Yacht Club?Why did they paint the stolen boat's hull a new color (white with lavender trim) but leave the cabin its original blue?Real people did the crime to real victims in real places, but Bugliosi overlooked more opportunities to find facts than did the prosecutors.An exciting story, it should not be considered entirely factual."
5,Only Bugliosi could have won this case,"With any other attorney, she would be in jail right now. I still think that she is guilty, but he has a way of changing your mind. The best attorney in the world, hands down. His closing argument should be required study in every law school. This is a great book, but his best is ""Outrage"". That book IS required study in many Law Schools."
2,Bugliosi what were you thinking???,"I read this book hoping it would be as good as Helter Skelter, I was wrong. Although the story itself is very interesting the fact that Bugliosi would later write a book slamming other attorneys for defending their ""guilty"" client is laughable. He believes his client had no idea people were murdered on the tiny island she was on with only her boyfriend and the dead couple. Ridiculous! She may have not been guilty of murder but she sure knew what had happened. Bugliosi, I feel, prosecuted aCharles Manson and his ""family"" in the early 70's and has lived off the glory of one of the biggest trials of the 20th century since. He believes his own hype. He should be careful of whom he judges and attacks, no one will know for sure what happened in the case of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman just like no one will know if Bugliosi was played by Jennifer Jenkins."
2,And the sea will tell,"The first part of the book was interesting,( I lived on the Island most of 1947), but there was too muchlegal stuff after the boat was discovered in Honolulu."
1,And The Sea Will Tell,"My biggest problem with the book is the cause of death as related by the authors. It is difficult to believe someone, or possibly two individuals, killed and burned two people, then put them in a box or boxes, to sink them in the lagoon. Further this was all done to steal a boat worth maybe $100k. The murderers then sailed the boat back to the Hawaiian Islands where it had left approximately a month or so prior.I read the book during my personal sail down to Palmyra and spent a week investigating the atoll while trying to reconcile the story. I'm wondering what other readers have to say or think about this story?"
3,First part good,"The first part of _And the Sea Will Tell_ is engrossing and spooky: the troubled boyfriend, the ditsy girlfriend, the yacht-class couple, the nasty little island, the disappearance. But the courtroom portions become a bit tedious. I disagree with the book's cover that the ending was ""stunning."" Despite Henderson's efforts to make it suspenseful, the last 1/3 of the book was predictable."
4,Great story but frustrating.,"I reread the first part after finishing the book and it's one of those stories where you cannot prove she did it or knew about it, so I feel she should be free (IN THE LAW) but deep down I want her to be in prison. Why would a top lawyer keep defending her after she lied so many times. I feel he defended her because he wanted to write the book."
4,Gripping at first,"The first half of the book which describes the very interesting ""characters"" was very exciting and interesting. I found the courtroom banter dull and I even skipped through some of it. Worth the money, for the first half alone."
4,A True Murder Mystery Showing The Mechanics Of A Real Trial,"This story is very intreguing due to the opposing nature of the couples, the mystery of the accused, and the remoteness of the crime. I found the beginning of the book to be a little dry and difficult to get enthusiatic; however, after the crime, it became gripping, and I found my self unable to put it down. The trial and presentation of the evidence was astounding. However, the author's use of footnotes caused it to be disjointed and difficult to read. If he had written these facts into the story, I feel it would have been much more enjoyable. Still, I recommend this book and can't wait for the TV-miniseries."
4,A Good Book,"I thought this was a considerably good book. Only two negative things I have to say is the well to long Robinson Caruso setup (it was about 150 pages) and I don't completely agree with some of the conclusions in the book. Other than that it was a fantastic insite in the preping and executing of a criminal trial. Mr. Bugliosi is very up front with his opinions, very refreshing. He works hard to show us the behind the scenes going on of a TRUE murder trial. From plea bargining over evidence, to what is discussed in the judge's chambers. All around a great book."
4,"Could have been as good in 400 pages, but good","This book started off as a typical true crime book of the Ann Rule variety, and ended up being a transcript of hundreds of pages of trial; the latter was a bit dry. Bugliosi does a good job of convincing the reader that his client was completely innocent (so why did he give her a fictitious name in the book?), but I still have my doubts. All in all, it is more a book about his courtroom style than the crime itself. I thought that it could have been 30% shorter if he left out everything that was repeated. But, this was a book about Bugliosi, not Stephanie Stearns (alias Jennifer Jenkins)."
5,One of my favorites,"I read the book many years ago and had forgotten what a wonderful book (the first half, mainly) this is until I found a copy in a yard sale recently and reread it. I was once again transported to the shabby little boat belonging to Jennifer and Buck, amazingly finding Palmyra by celestial navigation! The author's writing skills made me feel as if I actually had visited the atoll.I must agree with the reviewers who feel Jennifer was very guilty and think maybe Mr Bugliosi knew it too. His book, Til Death Do Us Part was another amazing true crime account..marred only (to me) by the whole second half involving legal issues and Bugliosi's musings.This might come in first-place of my favorite books, but for the legalese taking up so much of the book. Still, a great book."
5,EXCELLENT. I'VE READ THIS BOOK THREE TIMES,DONT START THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE UP ALL NIGHT. WELL WRITTEN AND A DEFINITE PAGE TURNER.
3,Half good,"I found the first half or so of the book really entertaining, having spent a lot of time on small, deserted islands(dive spots), I could relate to an island where everything had reached its saturation point, the point where the island was sustaining the maximum life that it could sustain...everything living right on the edge. This part of the book had to be imagined, and I felt it was imagined quite well. Even the water was evil, baby sharks nipping at you just for wading around a little. The interior full of rats, crabs, etc. The second part of the book I believe was written by the co-author, and was too technical for me. All facts. I really like docu-drama, documentary only, not so much."
5,The Absolute Best of My Reading Frenzy,"I have been on a reading frenzy since discovering Amazon a few months ago (I finally bought some Amazon stock since I'm pouring so much money into the company). This book has grabbed me and threatens to take over my life. I am only half-way through and wonder what I'll do when I finish. Right now I am at work and thinking about leaving early so I can go home and read it. I probably should have waited until I finished the book to review it, but I couldn't wait to put my five stars on it. Vince, you better come through with an ending that satisfies. Who would ever read fiction when true stories are so fascinating?"
2,"Good first half, poor second half",I found the first half of the book well written and fascinating. The second half is what I would expect from an egotistical defense attorney. Should have had someone like Anne Rule write an objective account. This is my first and last book I will read by Bugliosi.
4,Mr Bugliosi writes a cracker of a mystery...,"Written by the lawyer who defended one of the accused, this book leaves no rock unturned as he discribes the case in detail. I learned a lot about the US legal system and how it plays out in a real life court room."
3,Starts off great!,The story is very interesting and the first half of the book is exciting. The problem is the second half of the book is too much about the author and his defending one of the suspects. Boring from that point.
2,A mystery that didn't seem solved,"The story could have been written with far fewer words and less ""self"" as portrayed over and over in this book, ""And the Sea will Tell."""
5,Excellent book!,"I had read this book a very long time ago. I remembered how I couldn't put it down back then. I was happy to find it again and eager to read it once again! True story, deserted island, murders at sea. Sounds like a Lifetime movie that was made up only its true. I'm enjoying reading it the second time as much as I did the first time!"
2,Trial Law Treatise,"Sea stories can be a wonderful read. But this one is much more about trials, law and lawyers in what I think is extensive boring detail."
3,"Haunting, unpleasant story","First of all, Vincent Bugliosi is brilliant and most people probably know it. I admire him tremendously. However, this book indicates that he, too, knows he's brilliant. Repeatedly. When ""Jennifer Jenkins"" is charged with the murder of the couple at the South Sea atoll Palmyra, he throws everything he has into defending her after deciding she's not guilty. And, truly, she may not have been guilty of the actual murders, but you definitely get the feeling that she's guilty of something. She shows inconsistent behavior, gets caught in several lies, and Mr. B. himself said she could change before your eyes into a different person.Can't help but feel that perhaps Mr. B was a little under her spell, too."
3,Not Clear,This DVD was not a very good copy. Therefore I was very disappointed in this purchase and would not recommend for others.
3,Pay attention to the asides,"Two other reviewers suggested, ""Might have been better in the original Japanese,"" and I discounted what they said. After all, it's a color book, right? Not quite. Truly, it might have been more clear in the original Japanese, which I don't read. Also, it's tiny--5x7--and the example pictures and swatches and some of the text is tiny, which together make it hard for me to enjoy this book the way I had hoped to.The ""favorite color test"" in the beginning is interesting and worth the price of the book. I couldn't follow the rest. (Incidentially, I just noticed that the author's choice of illustrations for October and November colors (Central NC; would be Sept-Oct north of here) is VERY different from what we would use as ""typical"" colorways."
3,Flawed but useful,"I passed the Network+ exam last weekend. This book and Sybex's Network + book (ISBN 0-7821-4416-0) were the main tools I used to study, along with a few free practice question sites (easy to find with any search engine). It's true, as other reviewers have noted, that this book has some noticeable flaws and downright terrible editing. Repeat questions and errors matching the options for questions with what's in the answer key are especially common. Nevertheless, it can be a useful tool. I went through all the questions and made flashcards with the information I didn't know, which was tremendously helpful in preparing for the exam (and convenient for studying on the bus on the way to work). I'd say get this book and the Sybex book, make sure you know all the information in them, and you should be good to go."
4,Good Study Guide for the price,"I am currently studying for the network+ exam and I chose this book because it comes with a cd with over 650 questions. I previously purchased the A+ exam cram book and passed it with ease. I also purchased the CCNA book and passed the intro exam. I'll take the ICND in a few months. Make sure you get the exam cram book with the measure up test engine, the prep logic test engine doesn't have nearly as many questions. You can tell by looking at the front cover of the book.The only draw back to the testing engine is that a handful of questions have the wrong answers. The explanations for these questions do not match the answers given. 5 questions at the most.This is a good substitute for the study guides that costs more than the exam itself."
4,Helped me pass the Network+,"This book is quick to get to the point with chapters that are easy to read, the questions at the end of the chapters review the material covered, and the two test at the end of the book.The only complaints are there it seems to be no consistency between the information presented in this book and other Network+ resources. Some of those examples are FTP ports, RAID, and backup solutions which are conflicting and leads to confusion.Also the test at the end of the book ask questions on material not really reviewed in the book. For example, password security share/user level, which was not covered at all in the book along with ranges of ip address (0-255) and what they can and can't be used for.Overall, would recommend the book for the Network+, just keep the inconsistencies down and authors need to provide all material for the tests."
2,Good overview but poor code and at times badly explained.,First off this book is informative about common AI game techniques. However it lets itself down hugely with the code sections and at times the rather clunky way of explaining some algorithms. The code should of been pseudo code and most of the math functions that are used with the code are never ever explained despite a laughable introduction at the start which covers about 10% of what you actually need to know.I've rewritten most of the applications in java and found them to be far more straight forward than explained and laid out in the book. Which is a pity because his style is light and the information necessary.
3,...,"As the author states in the introduction you need to read the book in a comfortable chair with a laptop+net connection, you cant read this without a keyboard with in arms reach. I expected the examples to be in pseudo code or at a less hard core level of C, if your programming is not top notch be carefull."
4,Really good book but...,"This book is really good for learning AI as reviewed in other guys' comment. However, this book does not deal with neural networks. When I first ordered this book, I expected some more neural nets recipes than his other book 'cause this book was published later than that one. But this book does not handle that although both of two books includes ""AI"" in their title. Therefore, I recommend to order his another book to read neural networks part."
1,More paranoid KKKristian BS...,"(Sigh) As if Hal Lindsay wasn't silly enough, now we have THIS book by Arno Froese... It seems more likely that people like the author will undercut democracy than result in any demonic election."
5,Track Listing,"Side 11-Bus Stop2-On a Carousel3-Stop, Stop, Stop4-I Can't Let GoSide 21-Pay You Back with Interest2-Look Through Any Window3-Just One Look4-Running Through the Night5-It's You"
3,It's not the Best of Eve Angeli,"I was expecting her best selection album. When I saw it on amazon.ca I felt really excited because I never found Eve Angeli's CD here. Then I bought it, however, I feel kind of disappointed....Here's a list of songs in this album:1. Une chanson dans le coeur (Felicita)2. Avant de partir3. Elle4. Nos differences5. Plus loin que l'avenir (en duo avec Nek)6. Au dela des reves7. fragile8. C'est pour ca9. Perche lo fai10. Ma priere11. Je sais12. Felicita13. Plus loin que l'avenirWell, it's average good but I don't like the song that she sings with Nek, I prefer Eve's version. I think Eve got a wonderful voice but these songs are not good enough for her. In other words, she should change her music style. By the way I think those photos in the album are very bad... I don't know why Sony Music put those photos in the best selection... it seemed Eve doesn't dress as good as other French singers."
2,Terrible,I know this is supposed to be a memoir/personal account but this guy is more self conscious than Woody Allen at his worst. Everything is portrayed in terms of how he responded to it or how it responded to him. And he's not very interesting.
3,"Good, but a little slow","I'm just a casual fan of Mark Wills and mostly enjoy his radio hits. Particularly 19 Somethin' and Crowd Goes Wild. There are good versions of both in this set, but overall it is a little heavy on the ballad side of things. The CD starts and ends with upbeat country, but has a 12 song ballad lull in between that eventually starts to drone and almost puts me to sleep. Actually would have been a better collection with fewer songs on it. I should have picked up the ""Difinitive Collection"" instead."
3,Great but for infrared,"I like the size of this remote and the laser pointer is great. But infrared does not work as well as RF. If this were an RF remote, it would be much better. I also wish it had a 'B' shortcut to blank the screen."
4,Beautiful Prose,"I'm a sophomore at a midwestern university, and I stumbled upon this novella while surfing the net. I was not disappointed with my purchase. The prose was superb, and at times beautifully poetic in its imagery. The plot was great and the story interestingly executed. I enjoyed the transition to the American Civil War, but it should have been longer. In general I felt the book was excellent, and might even be a best seller someday, if Dickson rewrites it and extends the length another hundred or so pages to accommodate more character development. But he really needs to advertise and market as well. The major publishers turn out lots of shlock, but they sell it through huge promotional budgets. If Dickson could just get his works a bit more exposure, I do believe his sales rankings on Amazon would rise. He is definitely a natural born writer."
4,THE JOSEPH STORY TOLD IN A GREAT WAY FOR A YOUNG CHILD,"With great colorful illustrations. My 2 year old loves that it has pictures and names of all twelve brothers. Its fun to hear him say names like Naphtali and Zebulun. The story is well done, the only major thing it skipped was Joseph's time with Potiphar(for obvious reasons). Its also a good story for talking about hate, lying, forgiveness and trusting God."
5,Great Wallet,"This wallet is exactly what I wanted...room for checkbook, credit cards, change and paper money. I especially like the 2 different compartments and that the leather is so soft...and at a great price!"
4,Women's Wallet,The wallet is serviceable & has a lot of space.The accordian sides of the wallet get caught in the zipper on closing. That is my only complaint.
4,great but check journal didn't fit,"I ordered this for my mom. She absolutely loved but said the check journal didn't fit. She didn't care about that, though."
1,Do not buy this!,"I have the 8GB version that looks exactly like this one. It worked for 3-4 weeks and then stopped. When I plug it in, it tries to connect and won't, it just clicks. I've lost all my data. This thing is worthless."
4,Works great...but,"I've been using this flash drive for 5-6 months. I'm constantly trading files everyday between computers (Macs only, haven't used it on a pc yet) and this lil' guy has been keeping up with me all the way. The 4GB is more than enough space and it's pretty fast to upload and download files. The only reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the flash drive has problems reaching usb inputs in tight places. The drive isn't bulky (about the size of a mini zippo lighter) but I have to occasionally unplug other usb connections on a line to fit the drive into one slot. Overall, the quality of this flash drive is top notch and I'm more than satisfied with my purchase."
2,annoying,"this would be nice if it wasn't constantly rolling up. I went to the spanx website and used their size chart. I don't know if it would have been better to go smaller or not. Also, I didn't think it held anything in that great anyhow!"
5,Spanx Camisole,"You need to purchase correct size, very important. Please check sizing before ordering. Holds all the flabby parts of me in check. I also am now aware of my posture when wearing."
3,Good item but not as good as Unbelievabra,"First, getting a size smaller than you normally wear is correct. Second, this item is not as long as the picture shows. Even if it can be pulled down that far, it won't stay there. It does roll up real bad, but if you are wearing a belt you can tuck it in and it will stay. You have to wear a bra underneath, which causes bulge lines on my back, and this will not smooth that out (unlike Unbelievabra). When you first put this on, it looks great, but after a few min it starts pushing your breasts together like a shelf (no more separation). But it could depend on the bra you are wearing. I do like that it's snug and smooth. I am not sure how often I'll use it."
4,Nice,"This item works well. I could use one that has more of a V neck for under certain blouses and shirts, but it is comfortable and evens things out."
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this last fall, thinking that it would sqeeze me in the right places just enough. I hadn't tried any on in a store, only heard about them on TV. I'm not sure why it isn't fulfilling my expectations, maybe I got it too big. Also, it does roll up on my tummy if I'm not careful to tuck it inside my panties. In addition, it is warm. This will be good in the winter if I remember to wear it, not so nice in 75+ weather."
3,Doesn't stay put,"While it is slimming and the material is nice, I find that the bottom is constantly rolling up. Not a cute look to be pulling down your slimming wear every few minutes."
3,spanx hide and seek,"I bought this product to help smooth my stomach area. It really works, but the only problem is it would roll up and it drove me crazy because I had to keep pulling it down. Other than that it was ok"
2,Not so good if you are big busted,"These can be useful, but they're quite low cut, so if you are big busted, and the neckline does not hit you just right, it can cause buldges up top. So weigh which bothers you more: mid-drift or bosom buldges. I would try them on before buying if you can."
5,Spanx Camisole,"I love this camisole. Very smooth, comfortable and definitely conceals the areas you wish. I do not wear a bar with this item and feel comfortable with the support I receive. Highly recommend."
2,Smooths you but doesn't suck it in,If you want something only to smooth you this will do it. It does roll at the bottom and doesn't really hold you in at all. Also hot. I am in Phoenix and can't imagine wearing this other than the winter. Nice concept though.
2,Not really worth it...,"First of all, I found the straps to be kind of confusing, and it took me a long time to figure out how to put it on.The dildo part was nice, but for some reason, it was uncomfortable to move my hips.The vibrator is located IN THE DILDO, not in the bunny part, so there is no clitoral stimulation whatsoever."
3,Interesting,"Found this to be an interesting take on the law of attraction, but is this a public domain book because it is free on the internet and they are charging $10 for her here on amazon?"
4,4 1/2 years and going strong,"It's an inexpensive DVD player so obviously it won't have the features of a top-line player. It does, however, do it's job and does it well."
1,"Ridiculously weak features- No ""time"" or ""time remaining""","I was looking for a cheap DVD player to replace my even cheaper broken DVD player. This one actually has less features than my cheaper DVD player, with inexplicable gaps. For example, you can select what time in the movie you want to jump to, but you cannot view the time in the movie that you are at. Not to mention there is no way to see how much time is left in the movie. It's hard to understand how the designers could leave such a fundamental function out of the player. Even old VHS players can do this. Magnavox: Stupid. Very stupid.Another problem is the lack of a 2nd video out, which my cheaper DVD player had. Not to mention 2nd audio outs. I understand these may be missing from cheaper DVD players nowadays, but the lack of a display function for time and time remaining is just mind-boggling."
5,Great book for gifting sweaters,"I've made a bunch of the sweaters in this book. I love the patterns - very well done and some cool, unique ideas. There's a simple baby sweater that involves weaving a ribbon around the edge when you're done - really cute. I gave a friend's son the snowman sweater and he looked soooo cute in it! This is my favorite knitting book - and probably like all knitters, I have a bunch!"
3,Wait 'til your kids know how to stay clean for a while,"before making most of the projects in this book. While I have no problems with having a few nice clothes for children, the reality is that that kids get dirty, and it will break your heart if many of these sweaters are ruined.If you're the kind who gets portraits taken every year to send to relatives, the designs are pretty nice. Pass the sweater down every year to the next kid:)The other items, hats, toys, etc, were okay, but nothing special."
5,Another smashing smackdown from TMP,"I drove 120 miles to Los Angeles in the pouring rain to get TMP's new album. It was well worth the traffic! This is modern bluegrass at its best, crashing in around your ears, blistering your soul and making your heart pound (although listening to ""Car Crash"" while driving in the rain is a bit unnerving). In any case, I expect nothing less from TMP than the best, which they always deliver. If this is your first foray into TMP's work... where have you been??? BUY THEIR ENTIRE CATALOG! NOW! You will not regret it."
2,save you time for another book,"I picked up this book with great excitement, thinking that It would be a great read. I was wrong. While it's an interesting plot, tho flow of the story is just off and it lags in certain places with too much lollygagging. It's supposed to be suspenseful, what with ghosts and ghouls, but in all honestly it just makes the flow of the story lapse. It was painful to read and I only finished it because I always completely read a book I pick up. I wouldn't pick this book up even if it was free. Don't bother with this book; look for another author."
2,couldn't finish it,I really tried to read this but couldn't. Maybe it was the ghost. I probably got to the part where it was getting really good when I quit. There are too many other books out there for me to spend time on a book that is just okay.
3,Folding cane,I bought this cane to travel with. Folding canes are very useful for travel and the Carex appears to be a superior version of folding canes. Would be better if it came with a wrist strap.
3,Shut Up!,"Either the other reviewers got a different version than the one I downloaded or they've been paid to lie.While one doesn't usually get an opportunity to purchase a whole hour of entertainment for ninety-nine cents, the A-Whole pitching the record label's website in the last few seconds of the recording makes it a total rip-off even if it was free.Talk about a Major Buzz Kill!If you don't have Audacity or Garage Band to remove this disruptive annoyance, expect to be rudely ejaculated from the state of bliss the preceding fifty-nine minutes will have induced.Without the voice-over, one may loop the waterfall & jungle noise to induce a restful night's sleep - but without home editing an hour of natural noises that ends in a commercial defeats the purpose and Un-relaxes the listener in veRy short order!Five Stars with the idiot edited out."
3,Can't use this for sleep because of a loud loon,"I was really enjoying the sound of the waterfall until a loon started piping in every few minutes. I listen to nature sounds to fall asleep, so this didn't work for me. If you weren't sleeping, this would probably be fine. I never got through the whole recording though."
4,Waterfalls,This is not my favorite. It is true to the real thing. I just don't enjoy the waterfall sound like I thought I would.
3,Garson puts the 'able' in Gable and this film,"Being a fan of Greer Garson I found this movie amusing for its departure from her ""Metro's Glorified Mrs."" (her terms) standards, although Gable's performance seems uneven and the mutual lack of affection between the two actors in real-life is subtely apparent. The ending is a stretch for the Gable character, and altogether the script lacks in cohesion. Great individual scenes, however, in the library and in the country home. 3 stars for Garson's plot-rescue attempts and for outstanding bits of acting from supporting players."
1,"Mis-Adventure, more like.","Clark Gable was sure lucky that this mess of a movie didn't end his career, being that it was his first venture after returning from active duty in WWII. The main trouble with the movie is his attitude; for some reason, Metro tried to revive the style of the younger carefree Gable in this film, the sort of fellow he was in ""It Happened One Night""--even Metro's memory was faulty, because that persona had already been replaced by the mature man of 1939' ""Gone with the Wind"". Here, he's just too old and had been through too much in real life (the war and the earlier death of his wife Carole Lomabard) to cavort around like he does in the movie, and with Greer Garson no less! I don't understand why the studio, having taken such pains to shape her image as a gentlewoman, had her buffooning around either. Check out the better post-war Gable of ""Homecoming"" and ""The Hucksters"", and leave ""Adventure"" on the shelf."
3,Garson and Gable have done much better,"the story of a sweet girl and a rough sailor falling in love has and had been done. They seemed to be just going through the motions on this one. But it is Greer Garson and Clark Gable, so even mediocre for most, is good for them! They could read the dictionary and I would watch!!"
5,True Gold,"My doctor recommended Gold Toe, telling me that he too was a user. Well, they are great. The ankle swelling that prompted their purchase has gone away. A bit difficult to pull (to be expected), but then they are comfortable and really do the job. Its nice to purchase a product that measures up to the manufacturer's claim. Good job Gold Toe!"
1,only 1 pair,"At this exorbitant price, I thought I could safely assume it was for a pack of 3 pairs...unfortunately I was wrong and am out $13 on regular old black socks. They are also uncomfortably tight."
5,These socks last.,"On doctor's advice, I began wearing the Gold Toe support socks about 15 years ago. I have had to replace them due to wearing out over time - that was the reason for my recent order, but they last a long time. The color never fades (My new ones are interchangeable with the ones I bought years ago.) and I've never had one fail in the upper part. I wear them around the house a lot, so I tend to wear the soles after a few years. Over the course of 15 years, I think this is only the second time I had to buy a set of replacements. It's a good quality sock that holds up well."
1,Too small and poorly designed,"The XXL socks were too small for my size 12 foot - I could not get my foot all the way in them. The tops were also flared and loose: had I been able to get my foot in them, I'm guessing they would have sagged.I would not recommend these to anyone."
4,Great Support!,Bought these socks to help keep down leg swelling. Gives great support and are comfortable.
1,Way too small,"I bought the XL ""Gold Toe Men's Support Over the Calf Dress Sock"" because I expected quality and a good fit from Gold Toe. The listing says it would fit shoe sizes 12.5-14. I wear 13 shoes. We couldn't even get them over my heels and fully onto my foot. My wife tried them and struggled to get them on her legs and she is slim - ridiculous sizing and there is no XXL."
4,Support sox,Very comfortable and effective men's support sox. At $9 per pair they are the most inexpenive I have seen. Cost $12 at JC Penny. Free shipping made them even more attractive.
4,Compression socks keep you healthy,"My doc told me to wear stretch socks especially on long flights. I find them to be comfortable if a little awkward to put on. I haven't had them long enough to determine how they will stand up to repeated washing, but so far so good. They seem to be doing their job."
5,great durable product,"Goldtoe support over the calf is superior to other support socks I have had, both orthopedic and regular. I am 7'-0 and the fit is superior with good levels of support in both the foot and the calf. Bottom line they make you feel better."
4,nice but pricey,"My husband loves these gold toe socks. However, don't make the careless mistake I did and assume this is a 3 pack. It is only one pair of socks."
3,It was ok,The product is well made. But was too big for me. My shoe size is 8.5 . May be next time I will order a size smaller.
1,I seriously threw these away after trying,I bought 4 pair. I wore them for 1 twevle hour shift and threw them all away. I wear compression socks every shift and these socks are the worst Ive ever bought.
3,review of Gold Toe compression socks from Amazon,"They do what they are supposed to, however they are extremely difficult to put on and take off. Unless you have a medical reason for wearing compression socks, wear regular socks."
3,Gold toe socks,These socks were a gift for husband who likes over the calf socks and they are hard to find in stores where we live.
4,Gonzo Prog Rock Video,Some will say it's campy some that it tries too hard but this Video compilation of the Tubes concept album that pokes fun at the emerging phenomenon of yuppies is a gutsy and entertaining view all in all. The vintage footage of a live White punks on dope performance at the end is worth the price of the video! I wish it were available now. I have it on LaserDisc with Japanese subtitles and Fay Waybills' naughty bits blocked out on a couple videos I would like to get a domestic copy to get rid of both those.
1,did not work,After Spending 1 hour to plumb the regulator in line I turned it on to test it and it didnt work. Double checked my work (im a plumber) and it still didnt work. I would have taken it out to return it but i didnt want to spend the time to re-plumb the line again.
2,Too Heavy,I bought these to use while shooting at the range. They may work well but they were too heavy and fit too tightly.The ear muffs also seemed pretty large. I'm going to get a electronic set which should be smaller and lighter.
5,Phillips cd and cassette player.,"It was a great buy and I would reconmmend others to buy it to because it is nicely priced and it has the sound of a real boombox. I wish that it had a microphone port, but other than that it's really worth the money it cost."
3,Threshold Competitor,"I thought that this textbook satisfied our needs of what our tasks were for the course. At first the book was somewhat difficult to understand, but after reading through various parts several times, I began to get a feel of what was to be expected to compete with the other companies."
2,Nice try.,I thought that this simulation was a good shot at getting as close to the real world without going out into it. I think that there were parts that could have been perfected but over all it was a good simulation and I would recomend it to other buisness majors. I enjoyed the competiton that it created and it was fun getting the results back to see who was on top each time.
1,What About This?,"I was given the assignment of working through and operating a business in the Threshold world. When I got into it I realized that many things were not accounted for in this world. The simulation starts you off in an industry that no one has been in yet. This is very unrealistic in today's world. The simulation also does not give you any information on what the economy is doing or what your competitor, if any, are doing. In the real world you would be able to tell a little bit about what other are doing but not in the Threshold world. The last thing that I did not like is that there is no customer loyalty or repeat buyers. Every quarter you have to find new customers and the old customers never come back. My understanding of a simulation is a make believe world that is very close to the real world. If this is true then Threshold is the worst simulation I have every worked with."
3,Threshold,"I thought that the simulation was pretty good. It was at some times hard to figure out, but over all it was good. At some points it was a little hard to read. I would recommend this to other business classes. I think maybe this would be a good way for all classes to understand and learn from."
3,Needs more development,"Threshold Competitor is the best simulation I've ever used, but then it is the only simulation I've used. There were definitely some aspects of Threshold that need improvement. The guide is not organized in a very user-friendly manner. I found myself spending a lot of timing digging in the manual trying to figure out details about the program. I realize that the simulation cannot encompass all aspects of actually running a small business. However, it would be much more interesting if the user had more control over some decisions. I really felt that if we knew what we were producing, the writers could better develop the marketing section. Overall, I found the simulation useful in helping me develop the skills I will need as a strategic manager in the accounting department."
2,"basic knowledge, little help","This book neglected to provide many details that an actual business would need in order to be successful. It gives a glimpse of what actual businesses must go through when incorporating every aspect of the business from accounting to human resource managaement. There are ways in which it provides the users with useful information and ideas for the business world, but I feel as though what is does provide is very basic. I'm sure that all simulations provide a similar foundation. In my opinion, there is nothing outstanding about it."
1,Porn masquerading as literature,"This novel is a fake. It's not mainstream fiction, it's just porn, dressed up in fancy clothes but otherwise porn. One chapter equals one sex scene. Chapter after chapter of the two philandering characters who excel only in rapturous leading to violent leading to dangerous sex. I'm dismayed that people seem to have been misled by it, perhaps because it's a Japanese novel. Believe me, good Japanese novels are not like this."
2,Maybe I Got a Lemon,"This product installed easily, and worked wonderfully for the first 3 months. Then, all of the sudden, my interior lights started flashing when i turned my right blinker on, and lit up when i pressed the brake pedal. I checked most of the ground wires in the car, to see if any of them were fried... Negative. I did tons and tons of research, and then finally I thought about this harness. I unplugged it, and plugged the original harness back in, and it works flawlessly. So, something within the harrness went bad... I will update review after talking with customer service."
3,"works ""kidof""",this product works physically but the male adapters included in this product did not fit into the female side on the car. i tried to modify them to make tem fit but it turned out to be too big of a pain so i ended up using splice in clips.
4,This tool works,"Used on a '04 Ford Taurus lower radiator hose. The band clamp is in a tight spot and is a pain to remove. It took a bit of work to get the clamp out, but it worked. The clamp grippers at the tool end could be a bit smaller which would have made it a bit easier to get the clamp out. In the end run, it worked."
5,Coax Seal,This stuff is pretty awesome and a must have if you're going to have any kind of outside coax connections. I used it on the connection between LMR-400 and a Dual Band JPole that I have on a 21' mast. It has weathered a week of wind and rain and will probably last a long time (or at least until I replace the antenna with something else).
4,It's just Coax-Seal...,Item arrived in the condition promised before the date promised. I would definitely do business with this vendor again.
3,They keep printing new editions but they're getting old....,"Ho hum.The Good House Keeping company is old and renowned. Its magazine and Seal of Approval are highly respected. This book is good as far as it goes with all these techniques:KnittingCrochetEmbroideryNeedlepointPatchwork & QuiltingRugmakingPattern InstructionsIt's a large compendium with color photos and diagrams on every page. If you're somewhat acquainted with any skills discussed, you might enjoy this book, especially if you have a natural talent to do a smattering of techniques. Because there are only brief passages on a given technique. For example, under Embroidery, I looked up samplers, a passion of mine: only 2 pages.The vast variety of techniques might attract you to try something that's outside your comfort zone which can be fun."
5,A Dictionary of Military History,"Reference text, kept in a military classroom. This book is part of a ist of ""100 Books Every Soldier Should Read""."
4,re: treasure,"some things you don't want to share with the world, you want to keep them hidden for yourself, alone. this is one of those things. this is my favorite george c. scott movie, subtle and complex and always powerful. the scene as he watches his son's hands bleed while trying to land the big fish and has to conceal his own dismay always moves me deeply. the island culture, the outdoor sculpting, david hemmings' portrayal as the lonely alcoholic, eddie, the awkardness of the relationships between the father and sons, all combined to make a beautiful and sad movie.as a bonus, the rich and haunting score by jerry goldsmith is one of my favorites (as well as his). i think that i'll listen to it right now."
4,Hemmingway Fan,"Super adaption of Hemmingway's novel. The latter third is a bit weak. It amlost feels like Schaffner is trying to take us over into ""To Have and Have Not"". There is a powerful theme in Thomas Hudson's time in Cuba hunting German submarines and his isolation and despair over the loss of his sons. It carries well into the emotion of his relentless hunt throughout Cuban waters for the Germans in the novel. This should have been used to finish off the movie. Instead Schaffner switches over into late 50's Cuba??? It weakens the end. Excellent first two thirds, though. The casting of George C. Scott as Hudson is brilliant. It fits him like a glove. If you didn't like the movie end, PLEASE read the book, Papa H would have wanted you to."
4,4 Stars & A Question...,"There is truth to the observation that this great flick seems to lose something in the final third. The first 2/3, however, more than compensate for the rest. That's why 4 stars instead of 5.G.C Scott may be remembered for ""Patton,"" but I believe this is one of his strongest, best performances - ditto for David Hemmings.Question: Is this available in a widescreen format?"
4,Evocative,"Splendid Scott performance in this Hemmingway quasi fiction of his times in the Key West area.When you think about it ..few actors could have pulled off such a sensitive performance for a difficult role such as this.Along with the co stars mentioned, Julius Harris turns in a jewel of a job as Scott,s( Tom Hudson) sober mate."
4,Islands In The Stream DVD Review,"Islands in the StreamWhat can I say? The adage ""The Book Was Better"" holds true here. If you truly enjoy anything Hemingway as I do, purchasing the DVD (used/like new) is worth the price if for no other reason the visual effect it provides. The book is outstanding even though it was released/published (1970) nine years after Hemingway died. Unfortunately the DVD does not follow the book in many key areas. Which should be particularily obvious to Hemingway devotees in that the main character, Thomas Hudson is a mirror image of Ernest Hemingway himself; the three sons could easily be Hemingway's three sons. If you enjoy Hemingway as much as I do, buy it and enjoy it. It's worth the price."
3,Difficult to install,Requires a level or flat spot for a neat installation. Difficult to install where I wanted it due to curved dash and instrument panel. That wasn't evident from the description.
2,Disappointing,"Well...I should have listened more to the negative reviews. Mine also did not come with the cigarette lighter part that is shown in the picture. Not that I have any use for it, but I'd rather just have that outlet covered. Also, the description says it has a 34"" cord...not entirely true. The entire length from the tip of the plug and including the length of the device itself is 34"". The actual cord is only about 29"". I will try it out and see how it works. I'll update my review if I am pleasantly surprised.....which I'm not too hopeful for."
2,Would not recommend.,Could not use this product from day one. The outlets are so loose that the fuse spring in the plugs push them out of the sockets.
2,It works but you can't use all the plugs in at the same time. doesn't fit.,"I bought this for a road trip. First be warned if your plug in is in an awkward spot, this will not fit. Also, we tried to charge two cell phones and a kindle and the plugs would not fit into this at the same time. We had to charge different things at different times, which really, what makes the point in having this then? It did not charge my ipad, even by itself. Be warned. If you have small plug ins it might be better for you."
5,Does as promised,Inexpensive and practical way to provide connections to multiple devices while in your car. Snug fit. Will be very useful for connecting two iPhones and a radar detector on my next road trip.
2,Not what the picture or description shows,The picture appears to show that extender comes with the lighter. Mine didn't. The description states that it includes mounting hardware. Mine didn't. Hence the only 2 stars. Decided not to return it. I had some self-tapping screws I used.
2,Disappointed,The socket extender I received worked once with only 2 items plugged in to it and then would not work again. It also blew out my car socket. I suspect there was a bad fuse in it. Too much hassle for what it's worth to return it. I just purchased a different one at a local store.
5,Works perfect,Easy to install or just leave it sit on the floor. Operates well. Great price. I've had a few other brands and this is the best one I've had.
4,works for the purpose,Works well for trips...thought the cord would be longer but it worked for what was needed. The jacks were snug enough to withhold kids tripping over the cords when getting in and out of carseats.
4,alittle bulky but awesome,got this item to power up some stuff in my rig .. perfect solution for a VERY quick means to plug multiple things into 1 socket..it is fused so you dont have to worry about the vehicle's system .. just make sure u keep a spare fuse in the glove box in case u think pluggin in microwave is a smart idea !!! LOL !!
5,Works,Ordered two and they both work just fine. Happy with the product has filled the need for more outlets in my trucks.
4,"Nice product, but limited to 10A.","This is a nice 4 outlet cigarette lighter plug, but I did not see in the description that the power is limited to 10A. Normal is 15A."
1,Died after 9 months,This product was pretty good for what it was. It's positives is that there are four sockets to chargebut the negatives is that the sockets are really narrow so if your plug is wide then you will most likely have to leave a slot unoccupied simply because the sockets are so close together.Another con for a compact car is the cord is pretty long.And the final and major con is it worked well for the first 9 months but died just last week. It is very disappointing as I paid more in hopes this would last a while. I will be contacting the company
4,"Works great, poor adhesive pad",The Unit works fine. It sure is nice having extra outlets. The adhesive pad supplied failed after a few days. Replaced it with velcro.
4,"Simple, Hard to Go Wrong","This unit is a simple, yet well built 4-way splitter for 12VDC power. Although I purchased this item for a friend, and so I have not used it extensively, I did disassemble it when I got it in order to disable the LEDs that light up when it's plugged in. I was impressed by it's high-grade wiring for the price. A thorough test proved that it was fully functional, and of course it's well fused. A good buy for anyone looking for more 12VDC power outlets. In this case, I was buying it for a solar power system. Perfect!"
1,DIdn't even last a month.,"Piece of s***! I used it in my car maybe two or three times, before the fuse gave out. I don't exactly know why it didn't work anymore. I actually bought replacement fuses."
3,Nice product just take notice,"Plug the item up, inserted a USB PowerGen charger into it and it blew the fused in the product. Not a very good experience with this particular product from day one.Update 2/10/2013: What I learned about this product is that it has a fuse in the DC plug part of the cord. The fuse is 10A. I replaced the standard on with a 30Amp fuse. The product is functioning fine now. I also of course brought extra fuses for back-up."
4,4 Way device,This device allows us to use several different plugins at one time. I can charge my I phone and listen to music at the same time. Well worth the money.
5,Worked great & very handy.,Great when their are a lot of phone's and tablets. This is strong enough to not flop all over the place.
1,12V four way socket waste of money,"Apparently the 4 way sockets are just for looks, because when I plugged 4 items into it, it burnt up. I only got about 10 minutes of use out of it. I had 2 cellphones, 1 DS, and 1 DVD player plugged into my van's lighter. It died right at the beginning of a lengthy trip with my kids. They were disappointed, as was I. I would like to have known that it wouldn't power so many items before I bought it, because then, I wouldn't have bought it."
2,Didn't need the product,"Since the seat warmer didn't perform to expectations, I plan to return this as well,Not much else to say..."
5,Perfecto,"Una solucionó perfecta, no calienta, no interviene en nada con la carga de la batería. Funciona perfectamente. Llego muy a tiempo, en menos del tiempo esperado."
5,WORKS GREAT,"This is a little bit bulky but I should have expected that. It works very well and I have had no problems with it. I can hook up my radar detector, Magellan, and cell phone charger all at the same time. Great to have for trips."
4,4-Way Socket Extender,"This product works well. I like the durable, long cord. I will have to use it over time to tell how it performs down the road; but so far, so good."
4,Not Really Had It Long Enough To Tell,"I placed this in a Honda that I bought from my daughter. It splits the power source (cigarette lighter socket) into 4 power outputs. Thus far, it is running a GPS and a radar detector and they seem to work fine. My son is driving the car so a third port is probably driving an iPod. So far, so good!!"
1,Blew a fuse and stopped working immediately,"Maybe it's my car, not this thing, but I don't think it should have blown out the fuse on my Honda Element and stopped working within seconds of having only 2 items plugged into it. So not only did I have to send this thing back, but I also had to take my car in and get the fuse replaced. None of these things seem to work -- the first one I bought died in about 4-5 days. They are all cheap junk made in China. Why doesn't some manufacturer offer a competitive item that isn't junk? I've had a different brand of one of these in my 99 Camry for years and years with heavy use and never an issue. Now that I've gotten the fuse on the Element replaced, I have ordered a different brand and have crossed my fingers. Too bad -- this one had pretty good reviews."
5,Works like a charm,"I bought this inverter because I have a satellite radio and a cell phone. It has four outlets, and I wanted to have a couple more available if I ever need them. It fits into a little bay on my dash, isn't too bulky, and I've had no problems with it at all. Highly recommended."
1,Really unhappy,"I bought this to let my kids watch two video units, both low voltage, on a road trip to Disneyland. It ran the units for about fifteen minutes, then got really hot, and shut off. I took it to a radio shack, where I bought another unit to do the same thing, and the clerk said he could see no reason why it would have done this. The other unit I bought at the radio shack worked just fine, actually, we had the two units, PLUS my laptop plugged into it, and it was fine. This unit was really cheaply manufactured, and isn't worth getting."
2,Paper Mario Brady Games Review,"This is an OK strategy guide. It's set up well, with tabs on the top of each page, so you can quickly see if a Star Piece, Item, Badge, or Letter can be obtained in this area. There is a complete bestiary, an items list, and a badge list. Unfortunately, there is an incomplete recipe list (it shows only 35 recipes out of 50) and although it is stated in the guide that there is a Koopa Koot favor list, there isn't one at all. The guide does not reveal all of the star pieces, and it tends to be insufficient when explaining how to get one. Analysis: Buy a different guide."
1,Only for ABSOLUTE football novices.,"This video is okay if you are a woman who doesn't mind being talked to like a mindless mall-shopping obsessed airhead. Also, the information is very, very basic. If you know anything at all about football, skip it and move to the next level. If you're looking for any insightful clues on offensive or defensive strategy, this isn't the video for you."
5,Awesome!,I just got this hammock today! There is only one word to describe it. Awesomeness. That pretty much sums it up right there.
4,Really good!,The watch is really cute. It is much better than in the picture. It is small - right the size I wanted to have. It goes well with any apparel. And the price is really great!
4,Very good watch for the price.,The watch looks decent and simple.I gave 4 stars for the price .I got for $24 and free shipping.
5,This is it......,"Not only the opening poem but it is one of my favorites in this book of poetry. This is it; this is the book you need to read. It will help you explore your feelings about love and pain. Jonterri's writing is honesty taken to another level. She writes about things that we think about but do not say. She opens your eyes by pouring out her heart. It takes true growth to speak of love, pain and life in such ways. If you are ready to binge and purge read this book, if you are not...read this book and you will."
1,ALL-TIME GREATEST HITS!?! SERIOUSLY!!!???,"The Beach Boys are one of my favorite bands. The 1 star is NOT for the music or band. It is for the greedy folks at Capitol and EMI Special Markets/CEMA for releasing this horrible album. They call it 'All-Time Greatest Hits' and yet, they only include 10 songs. This is absolutely insulting to the Beach Boys, their fans, and it makes their label, Capitol, look bad.Go buy 'Made in the USA.' Go buy 'Sounds of Summer.' Go buy ANYTHING but this. This album is an absolute ripoff. 'All-Time Greatest Hits'? Seriously??? The music here is great, but why buy this when it's all on 'Made in the USA' and 'Sounds of Summer'? It makes no sense.NOT RECOMMENDED."
5,Air vent Thermostat,"My faithful attic fan stopped working after 20years of fathful service. I by passed the olds thermostat, and the fan worked, must be the thermostat. Seached on line, got confused went to Amazon.com ordered, replaced attic thermostat--good to go. Amazon also has replacement fan motoers."
5,Works fine,Easy to wire temperature seems to be accurate.I find it interesting that people give a product a bad rating when really the rant is about the seller not the product??
3,Not a lifelong member,"Author's mother was in the Temple. I don't think the author spent much time in the movement. If I'm not mistaken his mother's name was Penny Dupont and she was considered an annoyance in the Temple by Jones and other members. It is an ok read, but again the author's memory is sketchy at best."
1,Gimmick Version,"Don't waste your time on this library. Not only can this be found at reduced cost elsewhere, the content of this release is worth zilch. At the very least I would recommendPC Study Bible Version 5 Reference Library Plus. The BibleSoft website has good literature comparing the differences between libraries.As a PC Study Bible users since version 3.0 I currently consider this software to be ABANDONWARE. While they continue to add books for sale to the library, I would not recommend this product until a new development is forthcomming. Though I do not use it, the BibleSoft user community currently recommends Logos (most major operating systems / devices supported, followLogos Bible Software)"
2,Translations available,"When buying this version, one should be very careful to note not the number of Bible translations but rather whether any of the translatons are what you want. Version 5 translations are not shown in the Amazon information but can be seen on the BibleSoft site. Does anyone really care what the Benjamin Franklin version of the Bible says other than historians?"
2,isn't very academic,"not to mention, that the author is especially harsh on ""love addicts"" - I thought this book was supposed to help, not beat up on someone's self esteem"
4,This book helped me a great deal!!,"In particular, I found it lifesaving to know that there was a narcissistic personality type--and I'd married one. There were times I thought I was going crazy dealing with my wife, but Susan Peabody's book helped me to see that I wasn't always guilty or always wrong. The relationship between my codependency and love addiction to a narcissist was defined in non-threatening terms, and I found myself more able to separate from her as a result of reading this book. Additionally, the strategies for getting and maintaining healthy relationships mentioned in this work continues to be of great help to me."
2,Great premise that fizzled out.,"Disappointing. A fascinating premise so I started with great anticipation of a discourse between rationality and spirituality through the 2 protagonists, Jill and Sam. Unfortuantely, halfway through the book the conclusion was forgone as the discourse became lopsided. Also I was also disappointed that Sam as a philosopher did not at least discuss other religions. To tackle the possibility of God/a god and then not discuss which god left an intellectual and spiritual vacuum. I would have enjoyed the book more if it had been left open ended to ponder the outcome of the wager for Jill by myself. If you want a read that supports a conclusion you have already arrived at to get a warm fuzzy feeling, you will enjoy this book. Otherwise, you may be disappointed as I was."
2,"Too Theoretical, Making Selling Complicated","Poorly written.Too theoretical, and lacking of practical cases and examples. The book tries to make selling an exact science, using a left-brain, analytical approach is insufficient since selling is an art. Try SPIN Selling or Non-Manipulative Selling, which are more practical and not filled with jargons or consultantese!"
5,Will exceed your expectations,"This CD does a remarkable job integrating emotional intelligence and intellectual intelligence. The concepts are supported by relevant examples illustrating how to apply the ideas and contrasting them with the standard practices used by most people. The idea of listening to your customer is not new of course, but the method of extracting data and using it to develop a solution is transformed from guesswork into a well organized process.Highly Recommended. I suggest the full 6 CD set. The examples will be very helpful in driving home the key points."
4,A Business Book That's A Pleasure To Read - It's possible!,"I love the mixture of reality and vague humor in this book.The principles apply well to business sales big or small. I am a consultant in a role working with Sales Reps and I found this so enlightening that I couldn't stop taking notes about how to improve my client interaction methods. This is a great book for rookies or veterans and it is so easy to read, you'll be finished and re-reading it in no time."
2,"Some Real advice, but a bit too Playful","This informal book is good if you do sales in a service/consulting related industry where the client may not quite know what they are looking for (or why). I really liked his ideas about trying to make presentations in person (because people don't really read proposals). There are some great tips on how to ask the right questions to find out what a potential client is really thinking. Seasoned sales professionals may find some of this advice old hat, but it's never bad to be reminded of some good basic ideas. Khalsa does have a weakness for having silly charts, acronyms and rambles a bit too long - by the end of the book I found myself wanting the author to get more to the point. But if you are new to sales or wouldn't mind a good refresher course this book is pretty useful, but by no means the definitive text on the subject."
1,Terrible,"This is a review of the CD collection. I could not get past the first CD. It was horrible. He seems like the type of person that is very analytical and says the same thing 4 different ways to make sure he covers all his basis. The actual material seemed very boring to listen to. No real techniques to attempt to make it lively. Also, it takes him a long time to get to making his point.It was bad. I would not recommend at all."
2,Save your money...,"While I appreciate the honesty and openess Mahan brings to the subject of selling, there is little new or insightful in this book. I would hope that the majority of salespeople have already crossed the ""morality bridge"".It is an easy read, and well articulated. Unfortunately,there is little correlation between what he proposes is a ""process"" (it's not) and the concepts articulated in the book. Also, I kept looking for things that would make a salesperson a better salesperson, and found very little. Other than avoiding bad business from the start, there's nothing here for serious, high level salespeople."
2,Academic Sales at best and not for me ...,I am sure many people love this book but man it is academia at its best if that's what you are looking for. Charts and graphs and decision matrix and everything but something real in my opinion. I see the world a little different than most but after thirty years in corporate America with Fortune 50's this is the last thing they need is more encouragment in the BS - but then that's just me. Obviously with the rating that is out here most dont agree so I'm still swimming upstream. I happen to have just read (see my review) The Best Damn Sales Book Ever and then this and go read it if you want to be a great sales person.
5,Not just for selling...,"We ask that our consultants use this approach not just as a sales tool, but as the outline for all development of solutions. It's a great sales tool, but, when extended out into the whole solution cycle helps improve the delivery of the solution with better communication.Helping Clients Succeed provides a means to cut through the fog of communication that so oftenLet's Get Real or Let's Not Play: Transforming the Buyer/Seller Relationshipcuts the effectiveness of the joint work we do with cliets.All system implementations require change - that is their essential point. Helping Clients Succeed helps us to work with our clients in a predictable way - so that every consultant knows where we are with the engagement. It helps us to work through the issues of communicating with all the shareholders."
4,"Selling from a different perspective, but is it too late?",Interesting book about how to raise the bar in the sales process. Wondering how easy it is in reality to get clients to play along with your different approach to sales after they have been beaten to death with lame selling strategies for so long.
5,Solid - totally solid,"Wow - this is fundamentally as solid as I have ever experienced. Not light reading, more like a text book, lots to understand and take in on every page. For the B to B sales, this is the book in terms of fundamentals. This is what we all need to be coming back and reviewing all the time."
3,Not the Fastest Read but...,"a painstaking exploration of a fascinating aspect of American history. I was particularly interested in learning more about the role of spiritualism in the suffrage movement, the conflicts between those who were in support of free love and those who were not and the intersection of the struggle ""universal manhood suffrage"" for African Americans and the struggle for women's rights.The scandalous life of Victoria Woodhull and her extended family certainly enticed this reader, but the book did lose momentum at times. It might have benefitted from a more ruthless editor; as some accounts (such as Henry Ward Beecher's secret love affair) were belabored.This book is not for anyone to pick up and read, I think one needs to have some initial interest in the topic so that they have the stamina to read and process the whole book."
2,almost but not quiete,"I've always liked Christina Milian but this cd was just...well it just didn't do it for me. I read a lot of great reviews so I was expecting the songs to be great, I even kinda like that Say I song...but ummm what was she thinking. She's not exactly what I think of when I think of a ride or die/down ass ""b__"" type, so why is she trying so hard to be something she isn't? Nothing is worse in the music industry then when an artist takes on a persona that everyone knows is completely unlike them. A few of the songs were ok and as a latina myself I liked that she even threw a little spanish in there but I'm disappointed, on the bright side, even though she doesn't look like herself on her cd cover it's beautiful"
2,Not good at all,"This album isn't good at all. The only thing that is listenable is the production, and that isn't even that good. All of it sounds the same. Here's a tip Milian - you shouldn't use the same producers for a full album. Her vocals are mediocore at best, and some of the lyrics are terrible. Try again Christina."
2,not as good as others,"this album is not as good as her other ones that i do own. the songs are all fast and to me, they all sound the same. it seems like she just put this album together too quick, and didnt think to put any good songs on it. im sorry, i love christina, but i was very upset with this album."
3,Where's the Ballads???,"this album was dissapointing. the new single ""say I"" is a hot joint, but the rest of the cd is lackluster. too many club bangers and not enough mid-temp and ballads songs. she should have used other producers... like timberland, the ppl that always do janet jackson cds jimmy something and roney gerkinstop songs of the albums:-say I-Twisted- Gonna tell everybody= this song hot. sound be the next single-foolin-- my love goes"
3,Christina Milian not as popular,Christina Milian just got dropped by her musci label. So that tells you something that not many people are buying her CD's and she is not as popular as she was in the past.
3,SOLID.....NOT BAD.,"This album is not bad at all. I guess not many people were feelin' it. It only sold 50,000 copies in the U.S. the first week and I think the promotion behind it wasn't too bad. This album has a HIP-HOP feel to it and it's got some really tight beats. Maybe in the near future it will do better."
4,Really amazin after all,This has got to be one of the best albums of 2006. This album is fire. I bought this CD the same day it came and I cant put it down. I also have it on my IPOD. Its fire.The best tracks are:Say IWho's Gonna RideGonna Tell EverybodyHotboyJust A Little BitSure was worth my money. A whole lot better than that r&b; massacre album from 50 cent.
1,"Girl, please....","Just read today that this 'artist' - and I do use that word very loosely - has been dumped by her label. Her reps confirm the split and say attribute the split to 'creative differences'. Let's be frank here: As a singer, she's a really cute girl. As a singer, she's a fine, fine dancer. But to anyone with a set of fully-functioning eardrums and even the slightest bit of relative pitch, you know that no one, and I do mean NO ONE, should have put a mic in her face to begin with.Let that be a cautionary tale to all you pretty wannabe 'singers' in the industry who think that being pretty is enough...enough to make people want to buy what you're selling.It takes actual talent.""Say I""? If you're unlucky enough to have heard that piece of dreck and had your ears bleed because of it, you know precisely what I'm talking about."
1,"a Broke Beyonce meets Mya,but the chick is foxxy","hey I ain't gonna lie when a Christina Milian video comes on I break my neck to watch her move&then gently put her vocals on mute. the songs themselves are decent,but Christina Milian's vocal range ain't why I stayed glued to the tv set when she appears on it. dime a dozen material on a whole. some decent hooks&things,but the generic vocals can't hold your attention&since you can't see her why you are listening to the music then oh well.like the Album title I find it amazin she has 3 albums out. as if 3 songs weren't enough with that range??"
4,Fine but Missing Gopher Mambo,"It is missing the track ""Gopher Mambo"" by Yma Sumac. A most important track to remember the jungling/hat rack set."
5,The Random House Crossword Puzzle Dictionary,"I had a previous edition of this dictionary, so essentially knew what I was getting. Of all the crossword puzzle dictionaries I have, this is the most comprehensive and useful - I refer to it more than any of the others."
2,I Expected Much More From Random House,"I'm shocked that this dictionary is so useless. In the dozen times I used it I found nothing helpful. Type face is small, pages are super thin and layout is inconsistent. I'll stick with my tattered copy of Edy's A-Z."
2,print is too small,"Print is too small. Other books have the info this one doesn't. Prefer Random House's 2006 Crossword Puzzle dictionary 4th edition with brand names, trivia and pop culture references."
5,A must read for all tolkien fans or any other fantasy reader,No person can Realy do tolkien justice for all the greats he has written for us. I feel this book was far superior to the first becaus it held together a little better.
3,Ok,It was an ok reading. Too long and confusing. Parts 1 and 2 basically is a commentary by JRR Tolkien's son on his earliest work. Just start with Silmarillion and work your way to Lord of the Rings.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"There is perhaps a little more variety in the second volume of the Bookof Lost Tales, compared to the first. You again have the story ofLuthien Tinuviel, but there are also stories with Dwarves and Dragons,and also the detail of the fall of the city of Gondolin into Shadow.This makes it a little more interesting, to me."
5,Absolutely Incredible!,"Those who are hard-core Tolkien fans will revel in the lore found in this book. Though at first I found these books rather difficult to read, I have come to absolutely love them. The two volume Book of Lost Tales gives much information on the creation of Middle Earth and some of the important events that happened in the first age. In the Book of Lost Tales 2, a page has been included from Tolkien's original manuscripts. Seeing that made me appreciate all the work that Christopher Tolkien went to even more. I am very grateful to him for making all these stories available to Tolkien fans. Probably the thing I like best about reading these books is that I now understand the vague references to history that are included in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit."
5,Early Version of The Silmarillion as told by Tolkien's son,"""The Book of Lost Tales 2"" includes several tales which will be a classic part of ""The Silmarillion"", yet all of these are in a cruder, more rudimentary form, than what readers have seen in the latter work. Among the most important changes is depicted in the early version of the tale of Beren and Luthien, here entitled ""The Tale of Tinuviel"", where Beren was conceived first by Tolkien as a gnome, not a man. There is also an extensive recounting of ""The Fall of Gondolin"", the Elvish refuge from Morgoth, not seen in ""The Silmarillion"". This is an important book for both scholars and fans of Tolkien, since his son Christopher provides excellent commentary and related material (e. g. poetry) in which he compares and contrasts the stories in this volume with their later versions in ""The Silmarillion"". So if you not read ""The Silmarillion"", I strongly recommend doing so before reading this book."
3,Hard read,"""The Book of Lost Tales -- Part Two"" is a hard read. Do not expect tales from Tolkien along the line of ""The Hobbit"" or ""Lord of the Rings"". This is a book written for the student of Tolkien and is more of a scholarly text than light reading. The book serves two purposes. One is to bring more of Tolkien's work into publication. Christopher Tolkien (son of J.R.R. Tolkien) has scoured his father's works and notes to gather the ""back story"" of JRRT's two novels...The Hobbit and LOTR. The second is to derive more revenue from his father's works. Christopher Tolkien is not a novelist, only a transcriber of his father's works. The book is filled (almost to the point of boredom) with scholarly annotations, explanations and trivia not really needed to enjoy the ""Tales"". Lest this be taken as a negative review, I enjoyed both books (Part one and Part two) but then I am a fan of Tolkien's works. Do not buy this for light reading. Buy it for its exposition of the genius that was J.R.R Tolkien."
5,Gothic English Mystery...,"I can't adequately review this movie without giving the plot away. Suffice to say it's a Gothic Murder Mystery with several murders and plot twists that takes place in an old stately English country mansion. Some of the characters are not what they seem and there are hidden secrets to unfold. Overall a very good mystery if you like the type. Don't expect a lot of action, explosions, or graphic violence. However, if sinister surroundings and characters interest you then you'll enjoy this one....surprise ending..!! Overall a good mystery and worth the money."
2,Ok book on leadership in Higher Education,"I didn;t find this book as helpful or as interesting as I hoped it might be fro other reviews and summary. Its OK and arguably worth a read, but I don't think you would miss much without it."
4,Beautiful way to see Spain (as well as Faye Dunaway and Joanna Pacula),"I was surprised by the quality of this movie. It is shot in multiple locations in Spain, and was actually a quite engaging way of learning about politics and life in Spain. Unlike the English version, it has the sex and naked women but it's done MUCH more tastefully."
3,A Spanish knock-off,Just does not compare to the American version w/Tom Berenger and all the hot babes.
2,Too much for cheap chips!,"I got this set on clearance for under $5. They are not ""heavyweight"" 11.5g chips. Maybe 7.2g. These chips are plastic/composite, and the spades, club, diamond, and hearts are painted on. Within a few minutes of just playing with these chips (just stacking them, clinking them together, shuffling, etc) the paint started to rub off.These are great to give my kids when I want them to stay away from my ""nicer"" chips. These might be okay for younger kids or maybe even teenagers, but taking these to a real poker game will get you laughed at!"
2,Well..,"The chips feel great. The paint job does look horrible but you don't stare at them. My real problem is that the description says it brings the dealer chip and poker instructions and I did not receive them. All I have is the chips. The plastic holder is broken on a corner, which indicates it must have fallen because that plastic is very thick. I now have to improvise dealer and blind chips."
4,Not bad value for money,"You get what you pay for, so a tin of $15 chips is never going to make you feel like you're playing the WPT.With that said, these chips are pretty good quality. They're not clay / composite, but they're fairly weighty pieces of tough plastic, standard casino size, perhaps 7-8g each with 100 in the box. There are four colours and a dealer button. Each chip is printed with a suits pattern on each side. The dealer button is indistinguishable side-on from a normal white chip so I put marker dots on the edge of mine so I could see it more easily in the box.They're certainly good enough for casual play and much better than some truly horrid chips that occupy the same price range. Some of those don't even weigh 3g and make you feel like you're playing with tiddlywinks."
3,Don't buy it from here,"I didn't know it at the time, but Walmart sells the SAME poker chips for two dollers LESS! And you don't have to wait for them to arrive. They are o.k. They do not have the value of each so you have to say prior to the game white is worth ...., blue is worth .... Would have been better if they would have put the values on them."
4,Nice Add-On If You Need More Chips,"These chips are made of very good plastic quality. They are a great add-on if you have already purchased a 200 chip set, want more chips and don't want to spend $20+ again. The chips are plastic but in weight and measurements they are similar to casino chips. You can store the chips in the tin box and the set comes with a dealer button. Four colors are included white, red, blue and green. For the price this is a very good add-on set. Have fun!"
4,Usefull,This chips were a gift and we use it every week in a poker group we used to played with. Almost like the one in the Casinos
2,BEWARE of the Picture,"The chips look a lot like the picture, but you don't get 5 different colors as it appears on the picture, there are only 4 colors. Considering I bought these because of the 5 colors, this was a disappointment."
5,Learn and Play,"I got this to play with my grandsons - no I am not a bad person, but believe it or not by playing blackjack it helped them to learn to add and at the same time it was fun playing. I think anything you can use to make it fun in learning it worth a shot."
4,Great Book,"This book is very well written and is worth every penny I paid for it. The authors are very clear,concise and understand the reader. The only drawback is that their Schaum'sOutline has the Finite Element Method, but this book, as detailed as it is, has for some reason omitted it. With that said, I still think the book is very well priced."
3,"Historically interesting, but THE SOUNDTRACK","Ok, when a film is widely available, I guess there's no harm of adding some crappy music (""Tangerine Dream"") to the cinematic product of a bygone era, but since this version seems to be the only one on the market, more than 3 stars for this DVD would be too much...Other than that, ""L'inferno"" is historically quite interesting, representing a specific stage in the development of Italian cinema (which, BTW, very much influenced the American cinema of the era), and the restauration process seems a bit uncomplete, as if there's much more to do with digital restauration technology."
3,Decent book,"I got interested in this book after looking at some NarcoCorrido album covers my friend owns and wondered what was the obsession with AR-15's and wearing bullet belts crossed around the chest. It's a decent book written from a ""Gringo's"" perspective. While it's a good read and very informative, I found that alot of the interviews he did with musicians, many were very tight-lipped and offered very vague answers or simply gave the author the run-around, and this occurrs over and over again throughout the book. I understand that these musicians probably fear for their lives and don't want to anger the hand that feeds them, or maybe they simply don't trust a foreigner prying into their lives, but it doesn't lend to good story-telling when every interview is a series of ambiguious dialogue."
4,UN LEVANTON POR LOS CORRIDOS,THIS IS A GREAT EXPLORATION OF MEXICAN NARCO CORRIDOS BY A WRITER WHOOSE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED BY HITCH HIKING THROUGH nORTHERN mEXICO. His journey takes us with him as he visits the most famous of the Corrido writers and the musical groups of the genre. His first hand narritive moves gracefuly along the landscape south of the border from the western state of Sinaloa up north to the Mexican American communities of Los Angeles California.This book works both as a history of Narco Corridos and its influences in Mexican society as well as a well written travel journal.
4,fascinating paean,"heard an interview with the author on marketplace radio, and then ran out and bought the book....great ride--and Wald deserves some credit for braving the wilds to chronicle these bizarre stories, and even better riff on the intricacies of popular narco Mexican tunes today...great untold story; Wald's writing is that of a real expert and lover of roots music."
2,Not really cooking on the road,I am a new RVer so I thought from the title this would have some easy to cook meals on the go. I love to cook but found the recipes just not my taste. I am a simple person and like good old American food. I mean who cooks lamb or curry on a road trip? It seemed to gourmet for my RV. Your better off just taking your favorite cook book instead. I'm returning mine.
2,Poorly designed product,"Case is cheaper than the competition; however, you get what you pay for: a poorly designed product. The description says ""Durable, weather resistant neoprene cushions and protects your computer"" however; it neglects to add that the flap isn't secured and leaves two considerable holes on either side where your computer is exposed. The case itself is insubstantial and does little more than protect your computer from being scratched. Although it does have a slim contour, when I put my 13"" macbook inside, aside from not securing, the flap also refuses to lay flat. The picture is very misleading. This case is embarrassingly hideous, and obviously function was sacrificed in the interest of making it reversible, a completely useless attribute. How anyone thought this would be a good design for a laptop sleeve is a complete mystery to me... Go ahead and pay a few more dollars to get an InCase with an actual zipper to securely enclose your highly priced electronic equipment."
4,Player Named Later,I love MLB books - this one was good to see the inner workings of trades. Great seein Marco Sucarto highlighted - he was one of my favorites when he played for BoSox.
2,CD..I don't think so,"I just finished boxing this thing up for return. The CD player (which is what I primarily wanted it for in the first place) worked off and on for about four weeks. Then nothing, which was ok because I was getting fed up with it anyway. It did pick up radio stations I couldn't get with my old (and pricier) clock radio but please realize that, at this price, the sound left something to be desired also. All in all, if the CD would have worked, I would have been ok with it..."
4,Works as expected,"This is exactly what you'd expect from the product. The sound quality is only 'ok', but you can't expect more from something in this price range. The numbers are very easy to see, and the volume range goes from very soft to a nice room filling volume.The only bad mark I can give it is some excessive button pushing for the replay function, but nothing really annoying. I'm well satisfied with the product."
4,economic and practical choice,"The alarms are easy to set. Sound quality isn't great, but for $29.99, it serves its purpose well"
2,Hardly a Bible,"A book on AppleScript, written in 2004, that completely ignores topics ""data sources"" and ""data representations"" can hardly call itself a bible.The problem with such books, that write from real-life experience, is just that. They miss the real-life experiences of the rest of us. This book asks use to shun the label that ""it is just another book on AppleScript,"" but that is all it is. Even 800-plus pages of oversized print cannot justify the $60 price tag."
4,AppleScript: A Comprehensive Guide to Scripting and Automation on Mac OS X,this book suitable for beginner (as me) and advanced user. It start with basic AppleScript skill. And the best thing if the language it use is simple and interesting. You will not feel boring (like other training books) when read it.
4,A Jolsen Review,"This musical was recorded live at the Victoria Palace Theatre 1/2 March 1996 which belies an ""authtenic"" performance in one of the grand dame venues in the West End. Brian Conley has an unusual voice akin to that of Jolson (view the movie, ""The Jolsen Story"" 1946) and brings a lot of convincing energy to familiar melodies of the first half of the 20th century. Sally Ann Triplett (Ruby Keeler) has an excellent clear voice that is more lyrical than the persona she plays. The story line is shallow for an American icon of such complex character. Those songs, though, are the heart of the show and one of the reasons for listening to this album. The recording quality is excellent with full range of sound. See the movie if you want to know a lot more about Al Jolson (and see Larry Parks in the role of a lifetime)."
3,a little flimsy--need to stabilize it if holding heavy boxes,We bought this for our business to hold file boxes full of paperwork. We have the long boxes in it and the whole thing is not very steady. I think that we need to stabilize it by attaching some wires or twine from the top of it to the wall. I thought this would be sturdier than it is. Would be great if our boxes were not so heavy.
3,Not as engaging as other titles in the series,"My daughter is 5 and found the books in the Puffin Easy-to-Read series (level 1) to be just the right stage for her in developing her reading skills. She is able to read them with a high level of fluency and the success she experiences with these books has given her more confidence and motivated her to read more. Level 1 here is for ages 4-7 (as recommended by the publisher). There are familiar sight words appropriate for this level.We personally found this story not as engaging as the others in the series. Here, the focus is on a clown and the phrases used are repeated, for example ""Butter needs bread. Bread needs butter."" There is no real plot or story."
4,Dream City,"This book is an excellent overview of recent Washngton, D.C. history. It helps explain much of current events and illuminates the personalities involved."
4,Great writing: Moving story,"As someone interested in marriage equality in Washington DC, I wanted to learn more about Marion Barry and found this book. Wow. Read it cover to cover in a weekend. Yes it's a book about Barry's politics as a ""situationist"" politician and his substance abuse challenges; but more amazing is how the book explores the psyche of a city. Would love to read the authors' text on the fifteen years since the book ends."
1,worst picture quality yet from this company!!!,"this dvd contains both the rare prints of the 1911 and 1920's version with sheldon lewis in both roles!! unfountunetly,alpha video used prints so blurry and soft.that they are impossible to watch!! i have a dvd-r copy,from a grey market dealer,that is a hundred times beter looking and sharper print of of the sheldon lewis version! it can be found on [...]!! as for the 1911 version,blackhawk films has a razor sharp print of it in their library!! they sold 8mm,super8 and 16mm prints for years thru the 1960's and into the early 80's!! any of their prints would look better than this trash!! pass it up and try to find both films somewhere else!!"
4,so NOT yesterday...,"I admit, I do not really like her voice. But, this song I think was exceptionally good! I mean, it's a fun, pop song that everyone knows, but doesn't want anyone else to know they know the words! It's a truly fun pop song!However, You can't really hear Hilary's voice. Her voice, as everyone knows, is pretty soft. So all you hear are the Strong BACK-UP singers. But, overall, I like this song."
4,Jammin!,"I, a 10 yr. old girl, think this CD is SOOO cool. It has songs that you have heard on the radio, like So Yesterday and also some songs from the Lizzie McGuire Movie like Why Not. It is a must for girls who love music. Hilary has a great voice and fun songs. It is a lot of fun to sing and dance to. All girls who like Lizzie McGuire or the Lizzie McGuire movie will lllooovvveee this cd! IT IS SO COOL!"
2,Yuck!,"""So Yesterday"" has a good beat. It doesn't make you feel depressed, while also not the kind of song that makes you want to bounce off the walls and throw some wild party! Actually, I kind of like good dance songs...but anyway, back to my review. Like I said, ""So Yesterday"" is good, but not great. It's not as good as ""Come Clean"", and definately not as good as ""Fly"". The lyrics to ""So Yesterday"" make her sound like a bratty little kid. I haven't heard ""Working It Out"", but I don't exactly want to.Hilary Duff is a fake, and so is her sister. I mean, what kind of sister is constantly trying to get in on YOUR fame? Not that Hilary Duff is really ""famous"" in my opinion...well, maybe as the biggest Avril-Lavigne-copycat-sickeningly-fake-needs-to-focus-on-what-she's-actually-good-at poser in music history."
2,Not for me.,I've purchased five different brands of soynuts/roasted edamame over the past month via Amazon.com. Each of them have their pros and cons. As for this particular brand I must say they give you a lot of value for your dollar. 12 12 ounce bags is much more then their competitors provide. Why I'm giving it such a bad rating though is due to its taste and texture. I guess I just prefer the smaller soynuts. These are relatively larger than the competitor's and don't have the soynut shell/skin. I actually thought they were peanuts when I opened the box. I find the smaller ones tastier and crunchier. The ranch flavoring wasn't what I expected either. To me it tasted like powdered milk when I was looking for more of a crunchy salty snack. Maybe the BBQ or lightly salted flavors would have been a better choice for me.
5,"Exceptional, informational, educational","This book is an excellent resource for the collector of Dedham Pottery. It shows examples of all the known patterns made by Hugh Robertson, founder of Dedham Pottery. Being out of print I was lucky to find a rare copy still available at Amazon. Thanks"
4,Easy peesy lemon squezy!!,Great product ! Went on easy and shipped very quickly! My son loves it and had a choice if many colors to coordinate with it
5,They Are Outstanding,"Streit's Passover Matzos, in the colorful pink box, are very fine tasting Matzos, produced by the last remaining family run enterprise in the United States. They are under Rabbi Soloveitchik's supervision, and fully comply with all halachic requirements. Enjoy."
3,Matzo I would not get again,I make Matzo Brey every Saturday and these matzos don't work so well. Usually I just wet the matzo and mix it with the egg. These matzos. don't absorb water well and to use them I have to soak them for a while so they soften up. as a craker they are fine with butter.
5,Amazingly Good Book!,"Before I had all the programming books, C, Perl, VB. But I was not motivated enough to read them till I read this book and try to be a good programmer well at least try to be a future hacker!"
5,The positive side of hacking,"It's so relieving to see Levy's capture of the positive side of the qualification to be able to hack. I believe the progress in the software and hardware development has been greatly advanced be the qualifications theses people have shown.When it later comes to the aspect of what this qualification has been used for, the results are more dubious. It is sad, however, that todays meaning of the term hacker seems to cover only the negative side of the history."
5,Wonderful history,"Levy's book is an excellent history. He captured a snapshot of a pivotal time in the development of computing. This is important as a historical resource. But it is also a really, really, great read. ""Milliblats"" stand out in my mind as an example of that!"
3,hackers,The story of hackers is fascinated. I like the style and a personal touch which makes a book quite different. I would like to see some pictures though. I am looking for a sequel talking about modern hackers.
2,Interesting but narrow history of computing,"It is interesting to read about what enthusiastic hackers did at MIT, but these are not the people who created the ""computer revolution"". That idea ignores a lot of talented programmers and engineers all over the country who were far more important and productive."
2,so so,"A nice overview of the history of software development, but it overglamorizes drones in the software industry and has disapointingly little technical information. It is overly pedantic in its glamorization of the so-called hacker ethic. At least Levy discusses the ethic in its historical context (where it belongs) rather than trying to pretend it applys in todays world."
1,Not very good,"I was very disappointed with this book. It is old, somewhat outdated and written from a skewed viewpoint of someone who idolizes the ""hackers"" who came from MIT. There was not much mention of the computer work done elsewhere. This ""history"" was one sided and not very comprehensive."
4,INSPIRATION,"Before reading In My Father's Image, I was not really a reader at all. But after reading it, I became more of a reader, to the point where I wrote several books myself. I believe because Mr. Saunders' book was easy to read and had a great story line. It caught my attention right from the start. The only thing that needed fine tuning was at the near end, the fight scene got a little fuzzy thought."
3,Interesting approach needs more refinement to truly matter,"This underground MC & DJ hip hop duo undoubtedly became overpraised due to the unusually experimental, black-tinged production consuming what could have been standard underground rap. Instead we have something far more gritty and artsy than most rap albums ever strive for, but it is an all-consuming aesthetic which sometimes cannot sustain limited talents on display."
4,great texture,As stuffed toys go this toy is the ultimate adorable version of a panther and has a very and is very soft and cuddly
2,Poor and cumbersome return policy,"This item came up during a seach for the webkins black panther that my daughter wanted for Christmas. Without paying much attention, the order was placed and upon arrival, we realized it was not a webkins. Nothing against the toy itself, the place in which we purchased it from has such a cumbersome return policy, it was not worth the trouble to return it."
4,"Good, But Not Great :(","I was expecting a great documentary. So, my expectations could have been too high for this movie to meet. But anyway, I would say this is a good movie because it illustrates the manner in which politics is insulated from outside ideas. The simple fact is that few can introduce an innovation into the system because it has become too institutionalized. This movie does that well. The only problem would lie in the poor editing."
3,Unfortunate...,"The documentary itself is almost unimpeachable for its portrayal of a modern David and Goliath political war. Mr. Jeff Smith romantically fights against a member of the political aristocracy with a totally grass-roots movement which automatically inspires sympathy. Througout the movie, I found myself hoping he would win even though I don't agree with his political views.However, my post-viewing research reveals that Jeff Smith is a convicted felon who broke campaigning laws and made false statements to the FBI. This dealt a major blow to my view of the documentary's credibility.In short, it was well-made, but Jeff Smith no longer inspires sympathy or admiration in me."
3,"Nice quality, too slim of design","The unit had good quality construction, however, due to the metal poles at both ends I could not fit my components in it. The depth is actually like 13"" with the poles."
3,they are ok speakers,"they are ok speakers if you are looking to fill a 4x10 hole, for a better sound spend some money."
5,Practical Entomologist,The book came in great condition and it was for a very decent price. I would recommend it to any student or beginning entomologist!
1,"Out of date, poor photo quality, unhelpful to beginner","My goal in buying this book was to learn how to generally identify different kinds of bugs. The pictures aren't clear, pre-point & shoot digital. I don't collect bugs so I don't know if the suggestions for collecting are spot on or not. A book that I bought later, Field Guide to Insects of North America, by Eric R. Eaton & Kenn Kaufman, has worked well for me. As I live in New England, Mary Holland's book, Naturally Curious, is amazing. She lists month by month what's happening outside and bugs are included. Her photography is incredible. She also has diagrams. If she uses scientific words, she explains their meaning in context rather than a glossary at the end. Using both of these books has helped me begin to understand entomology."
5,Awesome!!,"This CD is one of the gratest CD's of a tenor that I have ever brought, the selection of the songs was very intelligent and the voice of Jose Cura is impressive, I really recomend this item!! You'll be pleased with it!"
1,Bad material of the product,"The chips are losing the points color that it have on the sides (white ponts), the chips doesnt have lines to put one over the other, the case is too heavy and the material of the cards are really bad."
4,Made my family happy,"We've only had 1 family poker night but the 8-year olds enjoy it and so does Dad. Made a great Father's Day gift. Kids enjoy learning about probability and risk taking through poker and were delighted to see we'd gotten our own set.The set looks nice but I wouldn't roughhouse with it. It does the job it's intended to do, and does it well."
3,Kathryn Lasky or Kimberly Kafka?,"Amazon.com seems to have confused two books under one listing. It seems two women: Kathryn Lasky and Kimberly Kafka have both written books entitled True North. I am vaguely amused by how naturally the two books mixed up on this site; they have nothing to do with each other. Notice that some reviews refer to an interracial friendship during the time of the Underground Railroad, and others are talking about Alaska. (or maybe the underground railroad went further than I thought!?)"
2,"Just okay, two many loose ends Kafka is author not Lasky","This book was okay, but it wasn't the best read about Alaska. There were many little intewoven stories and the ending left a lot hanging. I liked it enough to finish, but I won't be looking for other books by the same author."
3,TRUE,the true north was alright I didn't really like the book because how it goes back and fourth from Lucy and afrika. When all the diffrent people helped her to freedom it really confused me. The only good parts were when Afrika would get chased and when lucy found her Grandpa sneaking around during her sister lucy's wedding because she took him by suprise.there was not very many funny parts in the book. because it was mostly a serious book how she is trying to get to freedom and all. the most funniest part was when she was getting chased by all the hound dogs. it was kind of sad how Afrika had to put her baby in a tree to take the dogs off her scent from chasing her.to compare the true north and coming home i think coming home was the best book i ever read. they're are two girls Lucy and Amy they are trying to find the courage to do something again!
1,Worked well for 6 months,"We bought the Hamilton Beach model 22559 toaster, and it worked well for about 6 months. The price was reasonable, the toaster itself looked good on our counter and produced good toast. The features that we used, such as toasting bagels on one side, performed appropriately. We were happy with our purchase for 6 months until that 'made in China' quality, with which we are all much too familiar, manifested itself. The darkness control stopped functioning, and all toast was uniformly burned to a crisp.Perhaps I am living too much in the past, but six months seems a short life span for a toaster - consequently the one star review."
5,Great toaster,This toaster is wonderful. I registered for it based on the looks of it mainly. I have used it many times and just love all the settings it has. Makes it hard to burn a piece of toast!
3,weather placemat,"My kids really enjoy the educational placemats and they do quiz one another on the content. We have many of these placemats covering different topics and they kids do retain the information but don't look at it as ""learning"" it's just fun."
4,Candlelight Romance,This is an excellent cd. I bought it for relaxation and it really works for me. I would definitely buy more Mantovani cds.
5,Loving it!,"I discovered Mary Logue by accident and am really enjoying her books. I found this book even better than her first with some great plot twists. There are a lot of 'oh no' moments in the book that do have you on the edge of your seat and keep you reading.I find the main character a little frustrating with all her emotions, but that's just me and part of the story line that makes the book what it is.If you are looking for mystery, intrigue with romance thrown in, then you'll enjoy this book.I suggest that you read the books of this series in order as otherwise the characters could be confusing.Really interesting twist at the end - I can usually pick twists but this one went straight past me! Well done to the author on that count :)"
1,Its old now,"By this time Piers Anthony is losing the magic that made him so refreshing a read in the first place. There's hardly anything new and even the puns are getting dull. I think its time he moved on to other works. If he doesn't, then his readers will."
5,"The Demoness Metra and Mentia, get stuck in a strange trial.","The book was thrilling at some points,wondering if The demonesses Metra and Mentia would make it in time before they dissolved into dust devils."
1,He's gone too far!,"The first few Xanth books were interesting. They were mostly based on puns and a few weird plot twists, but they were a lot of fun. However, you can only write so many books based on puns and silly word play. By this point, it's old and it's boring."
4,Good Read!,"I have to admit I have read evey Xanth book I could get my hands on, and while this one was fun to read, and had some good new puns, I've liked others better."
2,What happened?,"It seems like Piers' Xanth series is getting worse by the book. Although Harpy Thyme was well conceived, Geis of the Gargoyle put him back in the slump that Demons Don't Dream left him in. This one is worse. The puns are getting old, which is bad, because Xanth is made out of puns. Metria's character is represented well, but that's about the only interesting part of this book. The rest of it is all inane drivel. It seems like he typed this book with a really bad hangover. He is also forgetting a lot of what made his older books, from Spell for Chameleon to Isle of View, so enchanting; thier realism. There were real relationships and tragedies and all that, and in this book, everything is so plastic and perfect. There are a lot of loose plot ends. I haven't read Yon Ill wind yet tho, and I've heard it's a lot better than this one. I hope so"
4,Pretty Good...older ones better,"I wish Piers would have stopped writing in the Xanth series, even though I continue to read the newer ones. Then I would have been spared the pain of having each successive book being slightly less amusing. It becomes so old after this book that I don't know why I bother anymore...BUT the older books in the Xanth series are delightful. Invest your time and money in those."
3,too much too much,"Yes, he's quite the wit with puns and words and phrases, and yes it's fun.... but enough already. Let us have some interesting storyline too! I think I still like best the story A Spell For Chameleon. It was heartwarming. Roc and a Hard Place is just an exercise in wordiness. Does he get paid by the word? No character development, no plot development, just more and more and more of the same."
4,Xanth are Always Fun,"I don't read a lot of fiction, but our kids were raised with Xanth in the background. Now my daughter is writing a book, and Piers Anthony read part of her first chapter, replying with some excellent encouraging suggestions! Xanth has provided multiple illustrations on dealing with life."
5,Wildfire Fan,I never watched the Dead Zone but I was a big fan of the show Wildfire seen on the Family channel. Morning Light was the theme song of the show and is the best track on the CD.
4,Good Notebook,"I have had this unit for 3 weeks now and find myself liking it more everytime I use it. Very versatile and loaded with some very nice features for the price. The display is exceptional for a notebook, no need to hook it up to my 19"" Viewsonic. I was a bit worried about not having any backup/restore disks but was pleasantly surprised to find that it will make you a set if you want, on either a cd or dvd.The only drawback is the battery life. About 1 hour is all I have been able to squeak out. But considering that I bought it for a desktop replacement, I can live with having it plugged in.Overall, I would recommend this notebook to anyone looking for a desktop replacement in notebook form."
3,Good performance - low battery life,"I am happy with the performance of this notebook, but i had 2 drawbacks. one, the battery life sucks, i just recently purchased a new notebook for mobility and made this vaio a desktop basically. and two, it is bulky. i purchased it online b/c the features where appealing but when i received it was a lot bigger then i expect it. but aside from that, a very good notebook, just not mobile."
3,Vaio K15,"Overall, a solid mid-level notebook capable of performing a wide variety of functions and multi-media applications. Unfortunately, the down side is a pretty big one: battery life is pretty pathetic. Don't count on more than 45 to 50 minutes playing a dvd on a fully charged battery. I've also had a few intermittent problems getting it to recognize photos stored on my Sony memory sticks, which is kind of ironic considering it's Sony's own proprietary memory storage medium."
1,Dont ever think upgrades,"Never trust Sony laptops, you lose functionality if you ever make the mistake of upgrading and the laptop is pretty much useless."
1,yuck!!,this product really tastes like plastic with a raisin in it!!! i was deeply disappointed! i will not recommend this product to anyone!
1,The Trans Fat Lie,"If you needed any more proof that the government is not here to protect you (and it shouldn't be), listen up.This product claims: ""Zero grams of trans fat per serving"" which is code for; ""We adapted our nutritional information and serving size data to utilize the government approved lie to deceive you, the consumer.""The second ingredient in this product is partially hydrogenated oil. Which, by absolute definition is TRANS FAT.I strongly suggest everyone educate themselves on how this modified fatty acid is destroying your health, and the food companies know it. It's specifically designed to prevent oil from turning rancid, by preventing oxidation of the fatty acid.In my opinion, the hydrogenation of oil will result in law suits that overshadow the tobacco industry suits.In the meantime, I'll look for a better alternative for this product."
4,Not bad for the price.,"I bought my Montana in a pawn shop in New Mexico, really looking for a guitar to just knock around and not worry about scratching up. I wasn't expecting much, but was pleasantly suprised. For a 'no-name' brand, the guitar has a pretty rich, warm sound and a lot of volume behind it. I would recommend replacing the strings once you get it, and for the first few months, the guitar has a habit of going out of tune but after it's broken in, it keeps it's tune pretty decently. The fret board is painted black and the black paint rubs off after you play it a bit, the wood is showing through where I do chords and I've owned it for about six months.It's not terrible for a low end classical guitar but be prepared, the fretboard is rather wide and takes a bit of finger strength to do chords."
1,"Cheap, cheap, cheap","I got this tabletop from Toys'R'Us and was very dissappointed in it. The table itself is made of cheap plastic and bends very easily. If it hangs off the side of your table even a little bit, you'll have problems with people bending it when they reach accross or rest their arms on it. When folded out, there was a significant gap between the two pieces that made moving cards across the table a pain because they would catch in the gap. The ""felt"" is more like a thin industrial carpet. It's very rough to the touch and cards will not slide across it at all. The chip holders are made from the thinnest platic possible. It's so thin that you can cut your finger on the corner if you're not careful. They are glued down poorly and actually started curling up on the corners during my first play session. I will be returning this tabletop to the nearest Toys'R'Us and purchasing another one from somewhere else."
3,Works but questionable quality,"The table looks great and works well, but the backing starting separating from the table almost as soon as i started using it. It still funcitions great without this."
1,"Sterling silver diamond accented children's heart locket, 15"" review","The chain was very thin and fragile. The locket, itself, stopped closing properly within 3 days. I plan to send it back for a refund. Pretty, but piece of junk."
4,Good Buy.,"Really like the Heart Locket, but the chain will be replaced. It has come apart at the clasp twice so I will upgrade. Very happy overall."
4,I finally found...,"I finally found out what the name of this film is- After about 3 years of not knowing the name, and viewing it once, a long time ago on the late night classic movie channel. When I first saw it I was really surprised by the content, it being from the 60's. An interesting thriller to say the least, leaves one with an un-easy feeling after watching. This film must have some serious cult cred.- after all these years, and it being so violent for it's time. I enjoyed the film's intensity, and didn't even know that one of the thugs was a young James Caan??"
5,Old Favorite is Still Good,"It was a day to celebrate when ""Lady in a Cage"" was finally released on DVD. This timeless classic features Olivia deHavilland in 1964 - still a great actress and gorgeous - who is going upstairs in her private elevator when the power goes out. A pair of middle-aged hustlers find the house, thanks to everyone outdoors ignoring the emergency bell going off. It isn't long before three young thrill seekers, whose leader is a young and angry James Caan, crash in and take over the pilfering of the house. Caan decides the hustlers and the ""human being in a cage"" (i.e. witnesses) must die. Tension is high as we watch the events unfold. A must-see/must-have. You'll watch it more than once."
4,A 60's suspense classic!,"This has got to rank as one of the all-time great campy 60's shocker films! I had never even heard of it until I picked it up at my local Library. It is better than I thought, and Olivia De Havilland is fabulous as the 'lady in the cage'!!It is indeed like an extended episode of 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' or 'The Twilight Zone', or even more like 'Night Gallery' for the 'horror' aspect of the story.It's pretty frank, brutal & Violent for 1964!It's James Caan's very first movie, and man, does he play a bad guy!He was just beginning his film career, but he does a great job as the main villain.The way he meets his demise is an all-time classic scene--pretty gory for the time.All of this is of course shot in gorgeous Black and White! I praise Paramount for restoring this cult classic for DVD!I recommend this DVD for a campy late-night suspenseful film treat!It's a fun one--not a super great film, but fun!"
2,Unacceptable and Repulsive,"Echoing what many of the others have said about ""Lady In A Cage"", I'd like to add 2 words: UNACCEPTABLE and REPULSIVE.There are films that I've seen once and know I'll never bother with again. [""Sleeping With The Enemy"" with Julia Roberts is one example]. ""Lady In A Cage"" exploits an invalid which is hardly a laughing matter. True...Olivia's performance is a bit over-the-top, but imagine yourself trapped in a confined area watching goons invade your house. James Caan is convincing, but I found myself getting a little twichy after the first 30 minutes. Ann Sothern's appearance as ""The Goodyear Blimp"" made me wish she was doing her own TV shows instead of this mess!Perhaps the definition of a good actor is his or her ability to make a thin plotline look better than it actually is? But if you honestly need a sick horror movie to complete your day, there are certainly better films to watch!"
2,Terrible Acting and Script,"Whatever possessed Olivia deHavilland to accept the role in this mess will never be known. The entire movie is one twisted, melodramatic mess!!deHavilland's performance is campy and her characterization comes off rather stupid (this may be the director's fault and the fault of the script as well). What comes off as implausible and totally unbelievable could have been done very well with a better script.The scenes at the end (which I won't reveal for spoiling them) are laughable.The rest of the characters in the cast are throughly unlikeable!! You long to see them all dispatched. All in all this is a twisted film....especially the allusions to deHavilland being in love with her son (who is obviously gay and dominated by him).This is NOT one of the better films of the sixties macabre period."
5,"Suspenseful shocker with a violent, memorable ending.","Olivia de Havilland is a pampered poetess with a bad hip trapped in her private elevator during a 4th of July power outage. Her cries for help are answered by 3 brutal killers who torment her like a caged animal. The story is a fascinating character study of a spoiled woman transforming into a savage in ten sweltering hours. It is also an open social commentary on the increasing violence and carelessness of the early sixties. Like ""Whatever Happened To Baby Jane,"" ""Lady In A Cage"" has a unique story, a fantastic, tortured leading lady, and an ensemble of side villains that meet surprising fates. It's better than you might have heard. Definitely recommended for horror buffs and collectors of early sixties psychological thrillers. END"
2,Utah,"This book is about Utah from an anti-Utah perspective. I did not like the angle that was taken in describing this wonderful state, even though I am from California. It is short and the pictures are nice, but it is prejudiced against Utahns."
4,Good clipboard,"This clipboard is excellent. Some reviewers complain about the durability, and it is slightly flexible, but I have no doubt that it will still hold up through anything I'll put it through. It seems more durable than my wooden OfficeMax brand clipboard. It is also sightly longer than the average letter-size clipboard, by maybe half an inch, which is nice. The page can be only barely under the clip and it will not go past the bottom of the clipboard. The clip is strong, too.I took off a star because it arrived with maybe 3/4"" of a corner bent a bit. I'm sure they would replace it had I asked, but I just bent it back with pliers, which was good enough. I needed it the day it arrived anyway."
2,Legal size clip board,"When I took this out of the box I noticed there were several sharp dents along the edge near the top on the right hand side. It looked like someone had whacked it against the edge of another clip board. OK, I'll deal with it. I fired up my Dremel and used a grinder to smooth it out. Naturally that took the finish off the edge so I ended up putting duct tape on the rough places that were too deep to smooth out. That's a little too much work for a brand new clip board that cost $11.82 when I ordered it on May 11. Oh, and about that; the price dropped to $8.45 sometime before May 16 when I got it. Grrrr! Would I buy this again? Probably not.By the way, the best thing about it was the fact that it was assembled by the handicapped. If I were to buy it again, that would be the only reason."
2,2.5 stars,"Though he never wanted to rule, Lucan finds his own dreams crushed and that fate forced upon him when his father and older brothers are killed brutally. Now, revenge and restoration become his dual goals, ones he can only accomplish with Branna, a priestess whose dreams have intertwined their paths and revealed to her a terrible necessity and heavy price to pay for the welfare of the land.** Fans of Kenneth Flint's early works or some of Marian Z Bradley's will probably enjoy this; though set in another land, Branna and Lucan come to life as if they were perhaps a Druid priestess and ancient Roman Mithras priest. A bit more detail into the world would have clarified and strengthened the story, however. **"
3,Back plate could be larger.,Does its job... but be sure to really anchor it to the studs in the wall as the back plate is not large enough to give it ridgid support. Will not stand the constant tugging of the up/down chain of the backdrop setup without additional support in the form of another piece of wood added to the drywall.
1,Stupid design!,Opening in the hooks are too narrow to support any standard background pole - requires you to buy the super expensive Expan series cores to use.
4,"Nice book, tugs at your heartstrings. Kinda intense","I got the hardcover. Nice book. Well, actually it's sad, but nicely written.I have dealt with some cancer patients but I had never heard of the Shadows. That's wild to think that the flash was so bright that people turned to shadows on stone.I liked the way you couldn't tell if the man was halluinating or not. That gave it so much suspense.I'm giving it 4 stars because parents should use some discretion before letting kids read Hiroshima Stones - it's a shocker!Have fun!"
1,Amateurish self-published protest novel,"An earnest but amateurish and incoherent self-published protest novel featuring a reluctant Nazi who experiences the Hiroshima bombing and later goes on a crusade to prevent nuclear war by intervening at crucial points in the Cold War, using Nazi loot to finance his efforts. The back cover bears enthusiastic blurbs attributed to nonexistent publications."
1,What the heck was this??,"Okay -- did I read a completely different book than the other reviewers?? I found this book to be naive and ludicrous. While I agree with the author's mission to educate people about the devastation of nuclear war and the arms race, this book just came across as being overly eccentric and paranoid. The writing style was annoying and the thinnly developed characters were unbelievable. My copy said ""2nd draft"". Was the final version somehow vastly improved?"
3,A video that goes beyond the pre-conceived notion of Area 51,"This is a video which is filled with visuals. It goes beyond the pre-conceived notion of what Area 51 is all about.This video looks at the hypothesis that what is taking place in Area 51 is a front cover for Deeper Black Projects, i.e., a grooming ground for Emergencing Technologies for Global Governance. The more up-to-date material along this lines is a new video entitled: ""Alien 51"", released in August of 2001:http://www.hometown.aol.com/norio1944"
4,Delightful story about animals and how to care for them,"This is the story of a guinea pig named Olga, told from her perspective. From it you learn what a guinea pig likes. How they want their beds to be made, their fur combed, how to pick them up and all of the other aspects of the day-to-day care of a guinea pig. She is also a bit of a scamp, escaping, starting incredible rumors among the animals, and sometimes being pompous and self-centered. In many ways she is a typical pet.A combination of being an engaging tale about a lovable small pet and her thoughts on her treatment, this is a book that will help teach young children how to care for small pets. The gentleness that is required and to understand that they are creatures with feelings that need to be considered. I recommend this book for the child approximately nine years old."
4,Works well,I just used this tonight on my hair. I just put some highlights in my hair and wanted something to take away any brassiness. This does the trick. It foams nicely. It does feel slightly stripping when I washed it out. I'd recommend following up with a really good conditioner or hair mask.
2,Ehhhh...,"This purple shampoo didn't do so much for the color of my hair, I feel like it maintained the amount of brass in my hair instead of taking it out. I really wasn't a fan of the texture, smell or overall outcome of this shampoo. If you're looking for a great purple shampoo that works wonders I highly recommend Clairol Shimmer Lights, I swear by it!"
2,Meh,I used the shampoo a couple of times and there was no decrease in the brassiness of my hair. It appeared to be the only product for brunettes and not silver hair.
2,This did not work,"I bleached my hair for 12+ hours before using this product to get white hair, but light yellow was the lightest color I could get."
3,At Risk,"A killer stalks a small town. All across it, women are dying; a student, a nurse, a housewife. His next chosen target is a professor. Perhaps she was the main target all along. Weaving a carefully crafted web of terror around Liz, the Game Master keeps the tension level high. By both terror and sexual longing, Liz is tormented. Fantasies of three men plague her, but is one of them out to kill her? Is the killer drawing closer, or is he there already?*** It will be impossible to solve the mystery before the denouement. Some of the eroticism appears to be frivolous, however, the psycho drama is well enough crafted to compensate for that. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, freelance reviewer."
1,Going back to Suave :(,"I was getting a lot of breakage from using the straightening iron and my daughter suggested that I look for a keratin product. I ordered this and the Aphogee shampoo for damaged hair. The shampoo is just OK (I haven't seen any dramatic changes yet), but I'm not liking the keratin spray at all. I haven't noticed any decrease in hair loss, my hair feels sticky and-when I brush it-it feels like I'm actually getting MORE breakage! It's only been a week, so I'll keep using it for a while longer and see what happens.UPDATE: I've been using the shampoo, leave-in conditioner, and keratin restructurizer a month now and I'm still not impressed. I haven't seen any improvment in the condition of my hair - in fact, my hair actually feels more coarse if I don't use my Bio-Silk along with the keratin spray.I'm not even going to bother using up these products, I'm going back to my Suave and Bio-Silk."
4,Great product for Black hair,Great product. Have seen lots of progress of damage going away in a small amount of time using the aphogee products
3,"Good, not great","I have nothing bad to say about this product, but I thought it would repair my hair more than it did. I REALLY love the APHOGEE 2 step program though; kudos to that for sure; it really repaired damage. This shampoo does smell good though; like grapefruits!"
1,Unreadable,"Despite the glossary, it's unreadable--or, to be more precise, it's not any fun to read, and depicts a peculiar, unfamiliar and unconvincing setting. Shouldn't childrens books be fun to read? Also, wouldn't you rather your child read something not so full of very dated ethnic and gender stereotypes?"
2,Wrong track listing,"Nice voice,but CD has only 12 tracks.Also,it is a re-recording,from 1989,not the ORIGINAL RECORDINS from the 60sand 70s."
1,Finally found the song from the commercial,"The name of the song from the triple x commercial is ""somehwhere out there"" by our lady peace. Took me a while but found it enjoy."
2,Not enough.,"Whatever XXX might offer up in the theaters, it doesn't manage to deliver on this soundtrack, which is more hype than substance.Disc 1 is a mere 35 minutes long, and delivers only about 5 strong songs, several of which may be found elsewhere. What was strong on this disc hardly merits the price of the CD.Disc 2 is rap oriented, but provides little that is special. In addition, the only version of this CD available is edited, and that is one of my number one pet peeves with any disc. I don't care about profanity, but I detest censoring what's already there in a song, and this disc does it. The upside to the second disc is that it is longer, but most of the rap on here is mainstream, poppy, dreggy, and B-O-R-I-N-G. It maye be a draw to some, but not a selling point to most."
3,1st disc good....well two tracks are anyway.,"this soundtrack sucks. that's all there is to it. with the exception of rammstein and QOTSA, all the other songs suck. and the rap songs weren't even in the movie! anyways, just buy rammstein's album ""mutter"" which has feuer frei on it, along with other excellent songs (i.e. Sonne) and also buy queens of the stone age's album ""songs for the deaf"". leave this soundtrack on the shelf where it belongs."
3,just disc 1,"in disc 1, there are several songs include that beats me up. hatebreed is a song that the reason why i got this soundtrack. adrenaline is different and brilliant then it's orijinal. queens of the stone age, flaw and mushroomhead are another good songs. 5/5 for disc 1. but when i listened disc 2 it got me so bored even i like gangsta rap & hip hop. it is so boring. when i listened i was waiting to end of the song with a tired eyes. and 1/5 for disc 2. so the result is 3/6."
4,XXX Soundtrack is the BEST!,"I love this CD. It is the best soundtrack to me. ADRENALINE rules! It is the best song on the cd . It perfectly fits the movie. It is my favorite song. Gavin Rossdale was the perfect person to sing that song. ADRENALINE IS THE BEST! It has the best beat and lyrics. I love it! Other songs that I enjoyed were Rammstein's Fuer Frei, BANG,BANG!, Flaw's Get Up Again,and Moby's Landing. Even though I like hip hop the second cd wasn't good to me at all.But, this cd is HOT! Totally worth buying."
1,"PG-13 Movie, PG-13 Soundtrack","Ok so you saw the movie, and you figured that the soundtrack would rock...it doesn't really. Remember how ""Feuer Frei"" rocked? Well that track is only about 3 minutes and the rest of the tracks really {was bad}. (can I say that here?) Basically it's a PG-13 soundtrack for a PG-13 movie....."
3,meh.. not what i thought,"ya, this isn't exactly what i thought it was going to be when i bought it. i saw the movie, and although the plot wasn't exactly ""indepth thinking"", i liked some of the music. i thought that it would be all the ""pump up"" music.i got the cd and listened to it, only then to realize that well, it really wasn't all that great. i guess i got sidetracked from the music by the beautiful vin diesel.but if you like the kind of music that is on the cd, i say go for it. just make sure you know some of the tracks."
3,Lots and lots of songs to skip,"I bought this CD in a little fit of Vin Diesel-induced hysteria -- pre-ordered it even. I thought it would be a tighter soundtrack. Lots of songs you only heard snippets of in the film (which was forgettable anyway -- in spite of Mr. Diesel's lovely muscles). You'd be better off checking out the playlist first, and deciding if you want to make the investment."
5,"Great first cd, almost as good second cd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","I would agree that with most of the reviewers that the second cd is not as good as the first, but it is a different genre of music so you really can't compare them to each other!! If you get this I would reccommend this for the first cd and maybe for some of the songs on the second cd, but mostly for the first!! Get this if you liked the film or love great music!!!!!!!"
3,Decent.,"First off, I'm not sure exactly why they put this album on 2 CDs; each disc contins little more than 30 minutes of music, and consequently, both discs should have been fitted onto one. The first disc is good, if you're a fan of metal and hard rock. The second disc, however, is only rap, most of which was thankfully not included in the movie."
5,very good,very good movie and love the music on the cd listen to the cd ever day and the movie is very good
1,CD had gunk and multiple scratches,"I received my CD in ample time and was very excited about my purchase until I flipped it over and the readable surface was full of major scratches and some sticky gunk substance. I cleaned it off, but it still has resulted in a CD that skips a lot. Thanx buddy!"
4,Wish there was just one CD instead of two.,"My brother had this CD and I loved the first one, but I wasn't too much of a fan for the second one."
5,xXx is the best soundtrack EVER!!!!,"I bought this soundtrack like a week after it came out and i was surprised how good it was. After the first day i pretty much liked all the songs. I would have to say my favorite songs are, ""Feuer Frei"" by ""Rammstein"" and ""Bodies"" by ""Drowning"". If you havent bought this soundtrack you dont know what you missing out on."
4,song is NOT the OUR LADY PIECE song,"Hi again guys. Thanks for the help in locating the song, BUT the song that played in the first trailer (at least the one I'm looking for is NOT the band OUR LADY PIECE. The song in question is a definate ROCKER and not the ballad by OUR LADY PIECE. If anyone else can help me get an artist's name or song title for the song played in the early previews for XXX, please post here. Again the song in question is HARD, ALTERNATIVE ROCK."
4,Great Soundtrack.....BUT,"This soundtrack is great...BUT, there is a song that was played during the XXX previews (before the movie even opened) that is not on this soundtrack. It is an incredible tune that simply rocks. Unfortunatly, I have no idea who sings it. If anyone can answer who this artist is...please put it in a review here. Again, the song in question is not on the soundtrack, but surely someone out there knows who it is. Thanks."
5,AWESOME PEOPLES,"THIS CD IS THE BOMB!!!!! I LISTEN TO IT ALL THE TIME!!!! the only bad thing is the 2nd CD. the 2nd cd sucks, especialy 'lick'."
1,XXX {Sountrack},I bought this item without reading the reviews. I now realise that it was a mistake. Sountracks always sound better in the Cinema bacause the film adds to its effect. I only realy like one song on it anyway. So this is the worst sountrack I ever bought even though I bought some bad ones. ...
3,"Is the the ""Adrenaline"" from the movie?","Let me join the army of people looking for the Adreline cut performed over XXX's end credits, and included on the XXX-DVD as a music video. I've looked all over and can't find any sign of that version. Anybody know if it's available? And if not, why not? Amazon offers a Gavin Rossman CD, but the review says all the songs are from the movie EXCEPT the video song by Rossman isn't the same as in XXX."
3,anyone?,"Havent heard this soundtrack - and frankly I thought the movie was rather blah - but I was wondering if anyone knew what song Orbital was playing in the Rave scene in the beginning? If you know, please post"
1,a stereotypical american take on ireland,"God, this was a pathetic read. I was keen at first because I had been recommended Moran's work by a (usually) reliable friend. This is just full of cliche after cliche. Starting with the oh so blarney names and the oh so bleak Irish settings, the ""craic"", the povery stricken and drinking uncle, the poor little rich girl who doesn't realise that she is beautiful but nonetheless is described endlessly in almost masturbatory detail. Anyone not seeing the end coming a mile away needs glasses. Give me an authentic Irish voice over a loft ridden New Yorker anyday. Is this really how yanks see Ireland?"
4,What a sad story,"This story, set in Ireland, captures the reader early on and holds your interest, even as you sense that things will not turn out well. I wonder if the ""troubles"" truly influence every aspect of life in modern day Ireland, as the story suggests, or if this is an exaggeration. Having never been there, I cannot say, but pity the poor country if it is so. Too many lives in this book are damaged, wasted and distorted by the conflict. Although this book caught my imagination, there were times when I just wanted to shake the characters into living in the modern world, making thoughtful choices, and having some insight into their own lives. At times, there was some dissonance in the female characters, wherein, as a woman, I felt that the male writer simply got it wrong. Overall, I enjoyed the book, although it made me somewhat sad and depressed for everyone involved."
3,Good and bad,"The quality is great. I purchased a Philips CD player 5 or so years ago and it is still working as it did the first day I opened it. So I thought I would get this one.I love the sound quality but there are a few draw backs.Compaired to other MP3 CD players it loads slowly. Also, if you lose the remote you cant use the FM radio. I also have yet to get the Resume function to work on it."
2,Dont expect the radio to work.,I player works fine for CD. But radio is very sensitive to noise. Not worth.
4,god cd player,"Good sound, portability and options, but the fm reception is poor.The cd player Don't save the option of volume and bass in fm."
4,"I""m sure I'll enjoy it!","I've loved all the trance nation's before, so I'm sure I'll enjoy this cd as well..."
1,a load of bollocks,"this album was listened to in history by our class- yes, i am currently at school and yes, i have listened to this album in its entirety, despite being racked by spasms of pain throughout the listening. no, you don't need this- dance music isn't proper music. if you want proper music, try listening to iron maiden, metallica, pantera etc."
5,DAMN,"When i first ordered this CD, I wasn't sure if I would like it. I already owned Trance Nation America, and Trance Nation V.1, but I decided to get Ferry's mix anyway. This CD is unbelieveable. All types of trance, from progressive to hard. I recommend this CD for all the party kidz out there."
4,good choice,i am a fan of ferry corsten and system f. he did a good job mixing this cd. i like cd 2 better than the first. it has better flow and the songs are really strong after the first few. i would recommend buying this cd.
4,a good reading skills book,"I've used this book quite a few times with my students. The reading comprehension content, both fictional and nonfictional, was good. I would have liked to see more open ended questions or writing exercises included - nearly all the questions relating to the reading were multiple choice. This book's greatest strength is the additional skills review section it includes - it reviews context questions, outlining, bibliographies, and research skills. This book is more a review of skills already learned than an intervention or for pinpointing specific problems. Additionally, I would say the reading level is about mid-6th year or beginning of 7th year."
3,Partially used (written in) book.,"There was writing on some of the pages of this book and it was not disclosed by the seller. After using quite a lot of white out, I was able to salvage most of the pages and photo copy them for use. Luckily, I am only using the photocopied pages for 1 student that I tutor. I would not hand out these whited out pages to a class of students to bring home and show their parents."
2,Unbelievable,"I just couldn't get into it, then it was over. I didnt realize this was a short but thank goodness.. The community theater actors were unengaging and have no chemistry. The filmmakers couldnt effectively handle the short format so its point is simple, made right away with dialogue that is obvious and shallow. It's an interesting premise that should be discussed, I hope this is not the end of the discussion."
3,Secret High Rituals,This appears to be a reprint of ideas that John Harker drew from other components of the Higher Degrees at the outset of Freemasonry as they were perceived to be. Disappointing read.
1,"Shuts down during utility ""brownouts""","This would be a 5-star product if it didn't shut down during the most extreme utility brownouts on hot summer days. This happened to me twice this summer in the New York City area (ConEdison). It's the only electronic product I own that doesn't operate normally at all times with ConEdison power. When the voltage drops below a certain point, the lights go out and can't be turned on, although the LEDs on the dimmer switches continue to glow. When the voltage increases above the dimmers' threshold, the lights come on at full strength. If you have these switches in bedrooms, as I do, it's imperative to turn them off with the tiny push-pull switch before going to bed during a brownout that has caused the lights to go out. Otherwise you will wake up in the middle of the night to maximum light when the voltage comes back to within Leviton's acceptable range. The old-style Leviton touch dimmers with left-right on-off switches are not affected by brownouts."
3,Useful mini dictionary,"This dictionary is fairly useful in trying to read a menu or translate a simple document but if you are travelling around Malaysia ""Malay Phrasebook""by Anita Ramly is much more useful"
3,Not Good for Kids' Birthdays,"I bought this book hoping to find some good ideas for my daughter's first birthday cake. I also figured it would come in handy as she gets older. Unfortunately, while the cakes all look very pretty, they are not the sorts of cakes that a child, or possibly even a teen-ager, would find exciting. For the most part, they are very adult in their themes (with the notable exception of a cake designed to look like a diaper). The Penny Whistle Birthday Party Book has much better ideas for children's birthday cakes, albeit without color photographs. If you intend to use this book for adult parties, it might work for you. I think the title is misleading, however, in that many of the cakes tend more toward garden themes."
2,Another Disappointing Von Marburg Book,"The layout and design of the book are great. Unfortunately, the cakes are really unattractive. There are only two that I would be even tempted to make. Stick with the Colette Peters books for great ideas -- the elements here are unappetizing, and as usual for this author, the execution is sloppy and unappealing."
2,Nothing new,Lot on barcodes and some bible verses. I received the book as part of subscription package. Otherwise I would not have spent the money for it.
1,Cheap Trick....No facts,"This book is so incorrect it screams of poor research and a lack of biblical knowledge. The author makes the terrible mistake of pretending he understands the mark of the beast when, in fact, he doesn't have a clue. He mentions barcodes and computers. Ha ha! He is so far off. The mark of the beast has been upon the human race since Justinian declared Christianity the official religion of Rome. Wake up, author. You need to KNOW what you're talking about before you write and self-publish a book."
3,Disappointed,"Not a bad product, the labelling is excellent but I ordered 8x taiyo Yuden manufactured disks and received 16x CMC manufactured disks(Yuck)"
3,Great ending...,"I've read some of Judith Arnold's other books, and I have to tell you-this one kind of disappointed me. The storyline just drags on and on and on... I had to skim over maybe 75 pages just to get to the good parts! I thought Corrine was very cold-hearted. I mean, I know she loves the baby, but just because Levi wants to do the right thing doesn't mean she has to give up! DJ IS a great baby, and I know Levi has fallen in love with him, too. Which is why the ending came as such a mixture of shock AND predictability. Very endearing read, though, I had to admit. Levi and Corrine's Story got off to a VERY interesting start, and ends the same way! Happy reading!! :)"
1,Ugh!!!,"Another Paul Russell novel, another story of older lecherous gay men draining the lifeblood out of teenagers. Does this author have the ability to write characters with any dignity? Do all of his gay characters need to live in a rarified world where the hunt of sex justifies any action no matter how deplorable?Beyond the distastefulness of the subject matter, an even larger issue is the author's inability to give his characters (gay or straight!) any depth. They are merely cardboard cutouts acting without any genuine motivation. Max, Perry, Kyle, Donna, Leanne, Elliot are all one-note characters that act simply as plot devices to move along a laggard storyline, rather than showing any kind of complex thought or emotion.There are some wonderful gay novels out there that don't whitewash the gay experience, yet don't debase it either. And there are some wonderful gay authors who take the time and have the ability to put the human experience in deeper, fuller context."
5,Great Emotional Read,"The book was not predictable like other stories, but Russell crafted the novel so well that I didn't feel lost or confused. He writes from such personal points of view where I honestly felt like I was in the heads of each of the characters. I have never read a book like this before. Wonderful."
2,Don't purchase in summer months,"I have ordered chocolates during the summer months many times. Have always been satisfied, as they were packed in dry ice. Not so with this purchase. The bars were all melted. It was going to be a gift. Now I have to think of something else."
2,97-03 Pontiac Grand Prix Mirror from Amazon,"When I ordered this mirror the description said it would be primed, but when it arrived it was NOT primed. I called the number on the receipt, left a message and have heard nothing from anyone. As I am looking at the review, the mirror that it said was purchased is primed, but not true. The mirror that I received was black without any primer. This is my first purchase with Amazon and I am very dissatisfied. Not only because the mirror I received is not what it was suppose to be, but because I have not received a call back on my dissatisfaction."
4,One of my favorite Xanth books,This is one of my favorite Xanth books. Another favorite is VALE OF THE VOLE. They remind me of Oz: nice people travelling together and coping with obstacles and odd creatures. The characters here are livelier and more interesting than in VALE.
4,"Ogre, Ogle her...","Smash and Tandy sittin' in a tree... not till later, at least. Piers strikes again with his puny (that is to say, full of puns) tales of the magic of Xanth. Good use of Chem Centaur, Goldy Goblin, Fireoak the Dryad, the Siren, et. al.- they're all a bunch of fun characters. And giving Smash his humanity- something he'd denied all his life despite his human mother- is a stroke of sympathetic brilliance. It makes you like the story more. One of the better Xanth novels."
3,Good fun and easy reading,"While not a fan of Piers Anthony's mass market, book-pumping, auto-pilot, assembly line machine scheme, there are some noteworthy books in his otherwise generic and bland Xanth series. Having read all 18 or 20 books of the series, (they begin to grate on the mind) I must say that his first few books were his best. Ogre, Ogre, written so long ago was still fresh, the puns whimsical and the characters lovable. Good popcorn reading. Three star rating is given because I do not believe it is a classic, it does not distinguish itself enough from its brethren and all in all people are too generous with their ratings."
2,He could've done better,"I'm a pretty big fan of Piers Anthony, and of the Xanth series, but this book really ruined it. One of my friends was begining to read the seiris, she hit this book and simply stopped reading any Piers at all. I admit that the use of some puns were done well, but compared to most of the other books he's written, it simply didn't measure up."
1,Attempted rape rears its head in the world of Xanth,"Jewel's daughter comes into the sights of a demon intent on rape, while Jewel is completely oblivious. (Oh, those nice demons would never do that.) So, she escapes on a nightmare and is put into the charge of Smash the Ogre and along the way they pick up an entire group of damsels in distress.This is a story whose subject matter is more for adults, yet writing style clearly intended for kids. That, plus a resurgance of the panty obsession and the girls obvious envy of Irene's bra size, is why the 1 star rating."
1,"Campy, silly, and absolutely juvenile","You have to be an absolute Xanth nut to like this series. I mean, c'mon, ""blanket trees""??."
4,Pretty good,"I just finished Ogre, Ogre,and I must say it isn't quite what I expected, but it is pretty good none the less. The usual odd plants and creatures abound,but the end of the story could be the begining of a whole new story line. I really don't wish to give the story away, but if there is a tender spot inyour soul, I believe you will like this book.have fun"
4,excellent insight,"This book offers an excellent insight into Taoist philosophy. In a series of tales about the seven taoist masters, it shows how each of these 6 men and one woman have attained enlightenment, and the snares that they had to pass to reach it. From these tales we can come to understand Taoist philosophy, and contrast it with Buddhist philosophy (in the interactions between Buddhist and Taoist masters). The stories are interesting, and full of meaning on many levels. This book is a much better beginning point to understand Taoism than the Tao of Pooh."
5,Stands the test of time,"Written sometime in the 13th century, this novel/parable gives us a great overview of what it takes to attain the Tao. We live through the sacrifices and pitfalls that eight immortals make on their path to enlightenment. Eva Wong's work in translating this classic has to be highly commended. She takes very difficult and obtuse concepts and smoothly translates them in a manner that conveys the intention of the original author. To do so, she demonstrates her own attainment and mastery. Well done."
2,have to dig for info.,"I would not buy this book again. Yes it gives you the info you need , but in such a round about way , it's not real useful. Bad purchase on my part. It would be good if I had years to study it but I don't, I need a book I can pick up and pick out the info I need for all the treatments I'm going through. Would not advise stage 4 patients to buy this unless all you have to do is sit with this book in your hand and study it."
2,A good read but not about western herbalism,"I bought this book because I have read Michael Tierra's previous books dealing with western herbalism and easy to make herbal remedies. This book is not about Western herbs, but deals with conditions of heat and coldness, dampness, contraction and other issues related to yin and yang (I think). It's likely a very good book, but I returned it because it was not what I was expecting."
3,Should this have been left alone?,"I am sure it must have been tempting as a publisher or one in whom the rights to publish resided, to get excited about an unfinished work from a master with the mystique and cache of F. Scott Fitzgerald. In this case, while there is certainly merit in the writing, and some rewards to be had from the reading of this incomplete work by an acknowledged master, it is debatable whether many readers have been satisfied by reading it. I was not one of them. As always, Fitzgerald introduces characters both rich and shallow, and makes fascinating observations of an era which most of us find fascinating. But it felt incomplete, all the way through, not just at the end, and perhaps Fitzgerald may have polished or edited it a great deal more had he survived to finish it.I will stick with Gatsby and Tender is the Night and put this one down to experience."
3,The Last Tycoon,"The Last Tycoon by F. Scott Fitzgerald was more than just another depiction of the Jazz Age. Fitzgerald's theme, corruptive wealth is also present in The Last Tycoon. Even in this unfinished work Fitzgerald portrays the spirit of the age well at the smae time critizes the values of our society."
3,A Warning,"I think The Last Tycoon is a hard book to read because there is a whole lot of names to remember and it's about film producing-it somewhat gets boring to read about movie writers, actors, producers etc- However the book starts to get interesting towards the end because you wonder whether Monroe will be able to get rid of this boring life or not. But you don't get the answer to that because the book is not finished... I didn't know that it was unfinished until I read up to the end because it wasn't mentioned on the book."
2,Not Highly Recommended,"The book was kind of boring. It wasn't very interesting reading about Hollywood back in the thirties. Adults may get into it more, because they will be a little bit more familiar with the time period. But for teenagers-not very interesting to read. There are alot of names to remeber throughout the book, and you don't know how it really ends, because it is unfinished. You may want to know if one of the characters will get rid of his boring liferstyle, but you never find out. I have not read any other books by this author, but by reading this one first, I don't think I'll read any more of his books."
3,Good Book,"This book is simply outstanding when it comes to figurative language. Shakespeare uses 7 stages to describe the human process of life. The whole book is an extended metaphor.The sound devices used are onopatopeia, alliteration, and parallelism. I would definitely recommend this book to people like Ms. Stewart and for people writing a paper on it like Shannon Van Dyke. Peace,"
4,Very good voltage blocker,"This ia a very good product and functions as advertised. If you have an inline amplifier and don't want any voltage leak back to your cable box, dvr, etc, this unit is for you. I'm satisfied with the purchase."
1,Buyer Beware,The sets shown in this video are not traditional Shaolin Kung Fu. Rather they are a poor mixture of Wu Shu (Chinese aerobics) and a common village art known as Long Fist. This style of Kung Fu is a creation of the Communist government of China and one designed to sucker money from naive Westerners.
3,Excellent resource for ageing b-boys,"I first read this book about 15 years ago........it was my first introduction to serious cultural critique .David Toop is a very intelligent and knowledgable man , and his theories on the African Origins of Rap Music are a must read for anyone seriously interrseted in the Music........rather than the commercial phenomenan ( it is now) that WAS hip hop."
2,Don't waste your time.`,If you want good reading stick with Copeland's latest works. These stories are too teenage'ish for me. The stories are recycled and predictable with no depth. Easy read.
2,Someone whistling in the recording.....,"As a general warning to those interested in this cd, I have found that the recording is spoiled by outside noises.I am sure others have noticed the off-key whistling sounds that come into the recording 3 or more times through the duration of the cd. I am sure these are not bird calls: (1) because they are audible as very close to the point of capture (microphone) and (2) the off-key, flat tone and pitch do not resemble any bird calls or sounds.Unfortunately of course this sound is very unpleasant for any seeking a peaceful nature recording. An excellent compilation I would recommend is the 'Echoes of Nature: The Natural Sounds of the Wilderness' [5 CD Box Set]."
4,Nice CD,"This is a good CD. You'd think that both tracks would be the same because they both start the same - light rain falling and birds chirping. But the tracks are quite different. And there's not just birds on this CD. There are also frogs and howler monkeys. Well, the point is that its a great CD!"
3,Nice cover,"This book was a disappointment. I've worked through it a number of times. And I've honestly not gleaned even 1 lick from it that I use in my playing. None of the licks are all that appealing. (FYI, I do play jazz/bebop, and have been playing for a few years.)Another person may get some new ideas or even get licks he/she likes. But I wouldn't recommend starting here- there are many other, better lick books out there."
5,Loved the INXS CD!!,My CD arrived in awesome condition and in a very timely manner!! It was even better when I got to listen to it...very good music...love the band!!
5,Delighted!,"It was a replacement for an identical item - I hadn't realized there were AA batteries inside, and the ones in my prior unit leaked out. The new one was easy to replace."
3,Great design but bad display,"I have ten of these in my house, and I have had to replace three of them because sections of the display stopped working. Another drawback is the loud click when the thermostat turns on or off but the sound is easy to get used to (so long as it is set to 20 minute intervals instead of 15)."
3,Be sure to buy several,These thermostats work for a while then cease to function. Be sure to have back-up thermostats on hand. We have radiant heat with 7 of these thermostats in Colorado and have gone through six of them in 3 years.
4,good value into Canada,"purchased 5 of these in october 2011 for my hi-eff hot water system; simple, easy to install, seem to work well. were about 1/2 price of anything i can buy here in Canada; INCLUDING SHIPPING, TAXES AND DUTIES. Bizarre as this priduct is manufactured (i believe) on the south shore of Montreal. go ahead and order, avoid overpriced Canadian retailers, have not found any canadian online houses with pricing even close. tell me if there is..... sw"
4,"How odd, mine were made in Italy...","These are great shoes, very comforatble, and break in quickly. I'm not sure why some folks are getting shoes that were made in India; mine are clearly marked on the sole, and inside the shoe, ""Made in Italy"".I deducted one star, as the soles started ""chunking"" the first couple of days I owned them. While some may say this is normal, I've been wearing leather soles for decades, and this is the first time I've seen actual divets in the leather from 2 days worth of wear.Overall, I do recommend them though."
5,A great pair of shoes and an excellent price,Beautiful black leather and deerskin shoes that are of the quality you'd expect from Bostonia. An amazing price as well!
4,nice shoe .... however,but the soles didn't last longonce I took them to the shoe guy in chinatown to rebuild them with sturdy soles --- I got a great shoe
1,Type of fraud,I bought the shoes because photography was written made &#8203;&#8203;in Italy.I received the shoes made &#8203;&#8203;in India?????There's a kind of fraud
3,Another side of Conan Doyle...,"This collection contains 15 of Doyle's supernatural stories. This is the first time that the stories have been gathered together in an American edition. The stories are:The Bully of Brocas Court, The Captain of the Polestar, The Brown Hand, The Leather Funnel, Lot No. 249, J. Habakuk Jephson's Statement, The Great Keinplatz Experiment, A Literary Mosaic, Playing with Fire, The Ring of Thoth, The Los Amigos Fiasco, The Silver Hatchet, John Barrington Cowles, Selecting a Ghost, and The American's Tale.These stories were written between 1880-1921, and for those who are accustomed to reading the Sherlock Holmes tales, these are a bit different. Doyle deals with strange happenings including ghosts, a mystery set on a whaling ship, Egyptian mummies, and even Doyle's own solution to the ""Marie Celeste"" mystery.These are tales of mystery, the occult and imagination. This book shows us another side of the man who created Sherlock Holmes."
2,not very creative,"I would have given this book 1 star, except the other reviewer seems so enthousiastic about this book, it must have some reedeeming qualities. I, however, do not see them. I dislike this book primarily for the decorating style. It looks like a garden exploded in all the rooms. Imagine floral chintz and pouffy window treatments by way of the 1980s. Yep, you guessed it, the pictures are outdated. Perhaps, the decorating tips in this book would be useful to some people, but the decorating style is so repulsive to me, I couldn't take them seriously. A better book that shows a wider range of design styles, and is a wonderful primer on decorating techniques is 1000 Practical Ideas for Home Decoration."
1,Another piece of junk.,"Firstly the cradle does not look anything like what's in the photo. The cradle that arrived was labeled Fosmon and has a large base.What makes this useless is the connection, which is hit-and-miss. Sometimes it connects, sometimes it's intermittent, sometimes no connection at all. The Palm branded cradle on the on the other hand connects perfectly.This one is destined for the garbage bin."
4,Very informitive,"i've driven by the salton sea a few times, i've heard the old timers speak of bombay beach back in the days. i have always wondered what happened? looks like a nuclear bomb went off and everyone just left.. i used to think while driving by. well i bought this video and now i have the answers! tragic story."
3,"First half is funny, second half is real","I've watched this DVD several times now and even took it out to the Salton Sea with me, where a small group of us camped near Niland and watched it using a projector. The first half is funny and got a lot of laughs because of the strange people and interesting history. However as the movie went on the content became more serious and less interesting. Don't get me wrong, it's a good documentary film, but the expectations of the film as a funny and interesting documentary are not met in the second half, and the film eventually ends on a low note. It's still a great documentary for those seeking to learn more about the Salton Sea, just not solidly entertaining all the way through to the end."
4,A dark horse in the St. John Passion race,"A live St. John Passion performed by Swiss Italians from Lugano? Yes, indeed. Such is the internaitonal reach of the period perfrormance movement that an out-of-the-way reading can be totally convincing. You might not believe your ears at the beginning, where the bass line and harpsichord continuo are five times larger than life, but conductor Fasolis knows how to conduct Bach. This Passion is more lyrical and joyous than tragic. Fasolis favors one beat to the bar, which is fast by any standard, but his phrasing is so fluid and flowing that it never feels rushed. The vocal soloists are middle of the road, and one wishes for more fervor form the very light-voiced Nico van Meer, yet the overall effect is convincingly dramatic and musical. A thoroughly enjoyable experience. The recorded sound, by the way, is exceptionally clear and natural, in sharp contrast to the nasty sonics on Gardiner's DG account."
4,Great product,"Got this because I was able to take the back off my wife's watch, but there was no way to put it back on. This gem came in the mail, in less than 30 seconds after taking it out of the bag, the back was securely back on the watch. Its a very heavy-duty tool and it will be nice adding it to my tool box."
1,Doesn't work. Waste of money.,Not much to say here. The tool doesn't work (which is what I suspect is the same thing they said about the idiot who designed it). Don't waste your money. It is too small to work on a normal size watch.
2,"Well built, but didn't work","I ordered this after the back came off my Bulova watch. I received the shipment in an orderly fashion, followed all destruction's to a tee.... and the back is STILL not on my watch.One other note, this press actually damaged the rubber seal that binds the two pieces together which forms a seal that protects the mechanism from moisture. Oh well, back to the mall i go i suppose."
5,Inspiring even today.,After years I still keep a VCR for this movie. Tom's surfing is truly timeless and this is a must have for every surfer.
3,Nice but small,"Even on the farthest link, this will be uncomfortably tight on my wife. It won't be horrible with an extension of some sort, but that shouldn't be necessary. Overall, it is very pretty and looks like a quality piece of jewelery - I just wish it was bigger."
5,Wish they would do more,My kids loved this and I have to say that they did a good job with the characters. I'd love to see another one with a bit more work on the animation. Good job at an entertaining movie that keeps the spirit of the classic Popeye cartoons.
2,PLEASE STOP IT WITH THE GCI ANIMATION![...],"I REALLY LIKE POPEYE, BUT I'M SICK OF EVERYONE COMPUTERIZING THE OLD CARTOONS! THE DID IT WITH THE CARE BEARS, THEY DID IT WITH MICKEY AND MINNIE, NOW THEY'RE DOING POPEYE!I KNOW GCI IS POPULAR, BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF THIS MOVIE HAD THE SAME ""OLD' POPEYE ANIMATION, BECAUSE GCI MAKES SWEE' PEA LOOK SCARY!"
2,Dreadful,"My kids didn't even like this. Granted, they have been overexposed to the Fleischer cartoons. But as I watched it, I could only think of how one minute of an old B and W one was better than this whole movie. The makers were doomed from the start, because those originals are just pure gold.The other problem, and main difference with this movie from the old ones, is that it had a ""message"". And a notable lack of senseless cartoon violence. Gone is the old back and forth fighting of Popeye and Bluto. Now they are friends. Sheesh...They might have pulled this off if they'd stuck to the formula."
4,"""Good Crime Drama!""","Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone and Joe Pesci star in Martin Scorsese's1995 crime drama. A man reflects becoming casino manager and lifein the mob. I like this just as much as ""Goodfellas"" and glad to haveit on dvd that has nice picture and sound plus some neat extras.I recommend this good film."
4,Store in Frig or Freezer,"I really like these. I throw a handful into items I cook and it adds great tomato flavor and color. I do keep the packages in the freezer or refrigerator, so haven't had the 'bug' problem mentioned. For me, no sulfur dioxide is a big plus."
4,Great house music,"I've been a huge fan of Ralphi's ever since I heard him spinning at Berlin and Fusion here in Chicago. He's one of the best DJs we have in this city (and there are plenty of great DJs here). There are some really great cuts on this album and the ladies he selected to sing on these cuts are FIERCE. Linda Clifford on ""Wanna Give it Up"" and Sevana Stone on ""Give Me a Break"" are going to give Donna Blakely a run for her money. Thankfully Donna shows she's still got it on ""Build It!"" I can't wait to hear these tracks on the dance floor. My only real complaint about this album is that he didn't include ""You Used to Hold Me."" I guess you can't have everything."
2,"Not bad, OTC is better, outrageous S&H, good service, prompt refund.","Because I was on a deadline, and couldn't tell much from the photos, I ordered 3 different load levelers on Amazon: this unit, the Engine Load Leveler from CVF (cheap-not worth the money) and the OTC Engine Load Leveler - 4305 (Costplustools). The S&H on this product was excessive ($28.55) compared to the other two vendors. This unit, while better than the CVF unit, had no bushings which increases friction and makes cranking under load more difficult. I kept the OTC from Costplustools-it was well made, and had the design details such as bushings, good attachment points and a good handle. I returned this leveler which was promptly and courteously credited by Handsontools, no questions asked. I recommend the unit from Costplustools-you will be glad you did when you are pulling that engine.OTC Engine Load Leveler - 4305"
5,Build an Antennae,"I bought this little guy to build an antennae. Its cheap, seems well built enough, and does the job. I don't regret the purchase."
4,"works, but a little too small","this thing works fantastic, i took my old roof antenna that hasn't been used in over 5 years, put this thing on it, and bam, about 30 digital stations that have great picture quality. Only problem I had was I had to install this thing in a different place on my antennae where it would fit, as the part where the wire splits is tiny and couldn't reach both wing nuts on the antenna"
2,Mediocre Floppy Disks,"I was really disappointed at the quality of these disks. I'm in a position where I work with floppy disks a lot, and these just did not hold up to the job. After running one of these through the process I use them for (installing operating systems), it doesn't take long before I have to throw one away and format a new one. So, that's just my experience with these and that is why I am on Amazon; to find a better pack of floppies."
2,Wears thin in a hurry,"I have a large collection of Scott Ross harpsichord recordings. The consistency with which the late Scott Ross delivered elegant, polished performances, eminently musical, was extraordinary! In his short life (38 years, dying in 1989), he recorded all 555 Scarlatti sonatas, and I can attest that there isn't a dull performance anywhere in that vast collection. He wasn't really known as an organist, and the organs he used in this recording were certainly historically significant. Alas, the recorded sound is shrill and screechy (and I do appreciate good recordings of organs of many periods). The performances are skillful, but the off-putting sound of the instruments is a big liability, and, to be blunt, the music itself isn't interesting enough to overcome that problem. The playing is very good, of course, but not very interesting listening. If you are interested in the rarity of a Scott Ross organ recording, get it, but otherwise, I'd skip it."
4,Worth Watching!,"This is a unique film, even though it does have a bit of ""The Sixth Sense"" flavor to it. Even so, there is still enough in the story line to keep you interested throughout the whole movie. The only thing that would have made it more enjoyable would be English audio. It gets tedious after a while to keep up with reading the subtitles. I agree with the other reviewer who said ""No English audio is unacceptable"", because I have NEVER seen a movie with only options for Cantonese 5.1 or Cantonese 2.0. I mean, come on, a major portion of the world speaks English!"
2,SCARY? SPOOKY?,"After reading all the quotes on the package I thought I was in for a supernatural treat. I was disappointed. This movie could have been much better and maybe it will after it is Hollywoodized(Tom Cruise has bought the remake rights).The acting and visuals are very good, but there is not enough skin crawling. Only one scene gave me a start. As another reviewer stated, there is some kind of relationship between the two main charaters, but it comes after only a couple hours together.This movie is not refreshing. It is very predictable. It verges on, but does not quite become lethargic viewing."
4,the eye.,"if you like movies like The Ring. You will love this one! very creepy, well acted and keeps you on your toes. A good movie to watch alone with the lights off and a big bag of popcorn!"
4,Interesting,"This is a well made movie, props to the Pang brothers. Its not terribly scary but theres certainly some tense, chilling moments in the movie. The ending is kinda weak, I didn't dig the hurrah everything is well and laid to rest end...coulda gotten more creative and crazy there."
3,disappointed,"Hmmm..wasn't overly impressed with this movie and I have to disagree with a few of the reviewers that claimed this movie was scary...in my opinion it failed dismally in that category, Ghostbusters was more scary. The acting was quite good by the lead character, but the young doctor who falls deeply in love with her after consulting her once or twice was pretty mediocre - and that whole scenario was a little unbelievable and cheeeesy. I was quite bored throughout the movie, and i feel the directors failed to capitalise on a pretty good premise for a movie."
4,A Review,"Despite what other reviewers may have said, this movie scared the crap out of me. For those who like The Ring and Ringu, this is a must see. Although the movie is not as fast paced as many horror movies, it is unsettling to an extreme. I liked it enough to introduce it to my friends all of whom loved it."
4,Creepy!!!!,"The Pang Brothers' ""The Eye"" is way above the horror films(hollywood trash) we typically see & forget right as the credits role.The film is great on all aspects screenplay, acting, cinematography, lighting & effects. There should be more films like this released in the US.I'd recommend this to anyone looking for an excellent film overall not to mention the sheer visual terror."
4,Superb movie!,"This is a very great movie and finally Hongkong make some good movies this year, Hongkong movie have been weak this past few years as those movies consist of weak story plot and lousy acting. Especially those actors/actress that just appear recently, they have the boyish face or beautiful body but they did not have the talent in acting. I've been a hongkong movie fan for a long time and it is sad for me to know that. Hongkong should went back to the roots of their movie that makes them famous instad of exploring outside the box where they did not have any experiences. I don't want to say the ending for this movie and i really suggest that you guys go and see it and make a comparison of Hollywood horror with Asian horror movies."
4,EYE'S WIDE BLIND,"THE EYE (Lion's Gate), is a terrific Asian thriller about a blind girl who gets an eye transplant and is able to see -- ghosts. Unfortunately, she has no idea what's real or not since she's never had sight. Artful and involving with some nice jolts."
3,Average horror flick,"A good horror film today is difficult to find. The average horror films recently produced are either comical, teeny slashers or just lame. ""The Eye"" directed by the Pang Brothers has elements of Traditional Chinese Ghost Myths (ie: floating dead people, long tongues, no chins...) intermingled with the modern world. It has nothing remotely similar to the Japanese film ""Ringu"" as mentioned by other reviewers. There is no comparison except the 'horror film' aspect. ""The Eye"" is a mediocre horror film with some scarey parts at the beginning and as it rolls towards the end it does have some smart twists but, then it has many cliches as well. All in all it is worth watching if you have exhausted all available horror films out there."
2,"Starts out promising, ending is let-down","First off, this film is not very frightening. True, it has a couple chilling creepy moments (like the elevator) but other than that, I was actually surprised by the lack of scares. The story was easy enough to follow and from what I remember, wasn't confusing. However, the end of the film pretty much ruined the rest of the movie for me. It was just weird, but not in a cool way. It just seemed off and it reminded me of another movie I've seen that had the same type of idea- Final Destination, which was alot better. It wasn't a bad movie, just an uninteresting one with a lack of chills."
2,Ehhhh....,"This movie is VERY SLOW moving and the story is just so-so. It didnt shock me. There are ZERO scares in this movie. The acting is not that great even thought the lead actress won a best actress award at the Hong Kong Awards...but it made me laugh how bad i thoguht her acting was. her crying seemed so fake and her scared looks were silly. the romnace seemed like filler and was cliche (would a man that thinks a women is crazy really fall in love with her a first sight? would he risk his whole life for some girl he just met thats running around saying that she sees ghosts everywhere? ...I dont think so). The end was interesting and saved the movie from getting a 1 star. i gave it a extra star for the good ending. most horror movies end on a BAD note. this movie is a bad not but ends on a good note. if you like not scary movies thatt move like a snail and have bad acting, then get your copy today! if not...get the Eye 2 because its way better."
2,"The eye was good, but much too creepy",i liked the eye but it was way to creepy. i watched it a month ago and i'm still freaked out by it!
4,"Just the right cocktail of suspense, creepiness, and likeable leading characters","The plot is not original but this film manages to achieve what other films of this genre have not: The level of suspense is fantastic. It's very scary but, the gory is not that bad. It moves along at a steady pace but, has some very moving death scenes. The leading man and lady are very likeable. Hong Kong and Thailand provide an interesting backdrop.Some reviewers have compared this film with Ringgu. I watched Ringgu after much hype and I hated it. The pace was tedious and the characters were self-absorbed and not very likeable. Moreover, the scene where the Japanese version of Cousin It crawls out of the well has become passé. Ringgu was a lot like The Eye 2. The Eye 2 has nothing to do with the first one and it is awful."
4,refreshingly chilling,"Finally, there exists a horror movie that actually frightens... I turned this movie on the dvd player the other night and watched the first ten minutes, but decided to watch the rest of it the next day, during daylight!The movie just was too creepy to watch alone! hahaJust get the movie and watch it, and you'll see why.I bought it and am very satisfied with it."
2,"Not bad, but not my cup of Tea","When I rent movies with my friends,I tend to chose Horror Flicks. When I first picked up the box for The EYE, and read the synopsis I really thought that this film would be a very exciting psychological thrill. To my disappointment, the story was a little predictable, and doesn't deliver the suspense and trill that typical Asian horrors do. The movie also dragged on aimlessly to me, while going on a witch hunt for the truth of the donor. The EYE 2 recently came out, not a sequel however, maybe it will be more thought provoking as well as suspenseful."
1,Poorly done retread,"Slow moving film about a blind woman who experiences the ability to see impending death when she gets corneal transplants. She decides to track down the donor's family, hoping to know why she sees these visions. Simply awful, poor dialogue, really no story at all. Shock effect of seeing ""grim reapers"" on their way to collect still living souls, is supposed to compensate for a lack of story. Been done a million times before, been done better at least one thousand times before!!Simply put, there is no point to this movie, and no point is attempted to be made.Avoid at all costs, unless you are studying Mandarin Chinese and need to practice it."
1,Boring,The Eye is slow and not that frightening. I was watching it and got so bored I had to turn it off. It was a total bore.
3,Well Made but Very Familiar,"If you've never seen THE RING, RINGU (the original Japanese version of THE RING), and THE SIXTH SENSE, you'd probably think this was one of the greatest supernatural films ever made.But I've seen those other films.So, instead, I thought this was a competently-made thriller with a couple jolts and an interesting ending. Because of the other films, I really didn't find a lot of surprises here, only memories of the dread and revelations from before.I've heard that, like THE RING, there will be an American version of THE EYE, so I hope they keep in mind that most of us have seen a lot of this stuff before. Maybe expand on the ""shadowy man"" who comes for souls or something."
4,Heartstopper,"I was a little wary of buying a Chinese language DVD with English subtitles. But, in fact, that actually added to the character and was not a hinderance. The ending was a little lame almost added as an afterthought and broke the rhythm of the movie (hence 4 stars). However, it was so refreshing to see a good quality Asian produced movie, that on several occasions seriously scared the bloody pants off this avid veteran horror buff. You gotta see this before hollywood get's it's hands on it!"
3,"Like the features, but speaker buzzed","I am a big online shopper and read reviews before I ever purchase. This radio had all the things I wanted. Seems rugged, like the features. Got it all set to go to a baseball game, and when I turned it on, even at very low volume, it had a speaker buzz. Checked quickly, nothing was loose. Happened on any station (AM or FM) that I tried. So it is going back. I will be looking for another Sangean model, since I have a number of their radios and really like them."
2,Go bigger,Poor reception capabilities. Bass vibrates and sound is distorted past 4 or 5 . You get what you pay for.
5,Great!!!,This radio is great!!! It is very heavy duty and it just feels well built. I have a big metal buliding and the U3 still has execellent reception.I am very happy with my purchase and would definitly by a Sangean product again!!
2,rugged but buzzy,"the radio is plenty rugged as promised but the speaker is annoyingly buzzy from low notes, even when played at low volume and the tone knob turned to high. Considering that this radio was designed to be played at worksites where it would be played at a loud volume setting the speaker's inability to handle bass is a serious problem."
2,Sangean U-3 Utility Radio-Sound quality and phone charge ability leaves a lot to be desired,"I recieved this in hopes to be able to put this in my barns feed room. The room is not very large nor is the barn so I do not have to blast the radio at all. However right out of the package the sound, maybe its the single speaker is terrible. scratchy. Whereever you are at the bass or treble levels or in the middle you almost think the speaker is cracked. I would hope no one knowingly sent me a defective radio. Any way the phone jack is useless. It is an inline like your head set or ear buds, what phone has a charger like that nowadays. I bought this cause it was rated number 1.. what a joke. It was not cheap!"
2,"An important topic, a data dump, and no expertise","Sure, the DMCA is an important topic. It is certainly a complex one, with many players having competing interests. I applaud Ms. Wilbur's efforts.That being said, this book offers little added value. It makes a great reference book, as all but 77 or so pages contain copies of various legislation. The book lacks any expertise, any interviews of those with expertise, or proper punctuation. Instead of posing well thought out questions and then positing hypotheses or data, Ms. Wilbur merely spews question after question, with no attempt at finding an answer. She brainstorms well, but doesn't follow through with any research.The title for the review sums it up. Know what you're buying. You aren't buying any new insight or expertise with this book. You are buying a handy refernce to the law, and a heap of off-the-cuff questions."
2,Dull Noir Wastes Fine Cast,"Strong performances by Robert Mitchum and Robert Ryan cannot save this dreary RKO crime drama. Based on the Bartlett Cormack play, ""The Racket"" (1951) has little spark and few surprises. Ray Collins stands out as the corrupt DA, but second-billed Lizabeth Scott gets saddled with a nothing role. Not even an uncredited assist from director Nicholas Ray could enliven the noir potboiler."
3,Good Old School Racket Movie,"""The Racket"" has all the cliché's of bad guys bribing City Hall to keep their crimes unpunished. The good cop, Thomas McQuigg (Robert Mitchum) knows the crime boss Nick Scanlon (Robert Ryan) from younger days. Nick has made tons of money in crime, and Nick is just a middle class cop with high degree of ethics. They meet and confront each other as crimes increase and become more deadly. Nick's bosses in politics want him to use less violence and Thomas refuses to be bribed to stay out of his way. Complications arise when a sultry nightclub singer becomes engaged to Nick's brother. This enrages Nick, and he wants her out of the way.The movie was made in 1951, black and white, and has several stars you may recognize from the early 1960's TV Shows. Overall it is the right length and interesting, although this type of plot has been in many movies."
3,Looked a long time,"I looked a long time for this light because I wanted the exact one that, after many years, needed to be replaced. This is not an accurate picture of this light, I could have bought this one weeks ago, and saved myself a lot of searching the web."
5,who doesnt love cupcakes??,i love that the two sisters work together and bring in their family members to help them to create these fun cupcake themes!!! i have never seen cupcakes like these before! waiting for more episodes to see what else creations they have !!!!!
1,So Scripted....,"I love Cake Boss and other shows of this type, but this one.... OMG it is SO scripted, I don't think there is more than 2 candid moments in each episode. I finally quit watching at episode 5... I can't bear another minute of the fake, scripted dialogue."
3,Not impressed,"I just got this book as I had finished the previous series that ended w/ Streets of Laredo and began with Welcome back Frank, I was not impressed.Many criticize the last series as PG and not well written but IMO they were actually better written and had a much better plot. This was more about everyone else than the Punisher, he was reduced to almost a secondary character and the plot was pretty much directionless.I plan on reading Vol. 2 of the MAX series but i do not have high hopes after this one"
3,BLAM,The book came in pretty banged up. More so then perviously stated. For now Im going to blame the usps.
2,Mostly shock value,"the story is so very shallow, the book is six issues of gore, cussing and as much over the top stuff as ennis can pack in here, ennis is like a kid in a candy store and was bad enough before they took away the censors.The book is set in a new ""max"" world where frank is not surrounded by by super heroes and none of the events of his old books exist (otherwise one of the charcters here would be stone cold dead), some might like that but I think the interactions with the old characters brought a lot to the book, but other than one character in the book, none of the ong history of enemies and allies have been around under ennis run, it's a shame since so many of them are just left hanging in limbo, unresolved, and some enemies like Jigsaw are never to be seen again i guess.With great titles like river of blood or even the ennis classic welcome back frank, i just can't see the need to get this unless your running out of punisher titles."
4,"Good story, questionable product","It is a damaged product that does not distract from what matters, the book's story.. The front cover is somewhat scratched in appearance"
5,"Does not include ""The End""","It's a fantastic book, which includes one of the best Punisher stoy arcs ever (In The Begining), but i thought that i'd let eveyone know that the post apocalyptic one shot The Punisher: The End is not in this book. But you can find it in the book From First To Last if you're trying to read it.Punisher MAX: From First to Last"
5,Selena Remembered,I only recently heard about Selena and was so taken by this young lady being cut down in her prime. The DVD Remembered is very good and takes you back over her short career and just how the family grew together and really it was just to virtually survive. Sincve then I have been loking for C/ds andDVD's that can tell me more of this amazing woman. The DVD did much to strength her memory. I am amazed also of the number of people in Australia who have not heard of Selena. This DVD has done much to enliven my views and to have others apprerciate this womans great charms for everyone who were fortunate to come into contact.
3,"No Meat, But a Nice Look at Selena","Selena: Remembered is a clean, simple, look at Selena's career and family/fan relationships prior to her death in 1995. Released straight to video as a companion to the 1997 film, it was also a way to introduce English-Speaking fans drawn to her from the movie to her Spanish-Language music. It is short and concise, syrupy and fun with no full performances or music videos. For a more informative look at the singer I would personally encourage a look at her VH1 Behind The Music episode which delves more into her personal life, career, and death. There's no unpleasantness here, just a simple look at the memory of a beloved star."
5,5 STARS FOR BRAVERY,"This movie was alot different than what the previews lead one to believe they're about to see but it was a breath of fresh air...I don't care if I ever see another stupid _Meet The Fockers_ type comedy; give me something semi-intelligent like this where the characters have feelings they don't always understand but plow on anyhow...this is an effective generational comedy-drama that isn't easy to forget...it touches on our changing corporate world (which can be scary if believed here) and what people will do to protect their children (or what they perceive their kids are about)...as a parent of college age kids, I found this to be a decent subject for a movie and it's done well here. The movie is a brave one for it's subject matter and I can see how they may have had a problem marketing it. For intelligent viewers only!"
3,2.5 stars out of 4,The Bottom Line:In Good Company is a rather forgettable movie; it doesn't do itself any favors by eschewing the primary romantic plot halfway through in favor of male bonding between Topher Grace and an annoying Dennis Quaid.
3,Slow and Steady Wins the Race,"Middle-aged businessman finds himself in the middle of a variety of humbling and surprising events, and the superb Dennis Quaid brings life to this character who handles everything that is suddenly thrown at him with a maturity, grace and dignity to be admired. His Dan has lived and learned to roll with the punches and take change in stride as life and its upheavals are like a pendulum. The gravity of his character as well as the stability of his home life and professional humility and loyalty serve him well in the end and guide a very young (and misguided) executive (Topher Grace) into a more human and humane direction. This isn't a BRILLIANT film but it is tasteful and entertaining, showing the generation gap problems faced in today's workplace. The film handles real men at their best and worst and does so skillfully."
2,Possibly the Most Annoying Movie I Have Ever Seen,"Until half way through I was laughing out loud. All the principals are well acted and funny. The Grace character is weird, and in a way the whole film revolves around him and I am thinking how the hell are they going to bring this movie to a conclusion in a way that is honest to these characters.Well the answer is, they don't. Grace and Quaid's daughter start a relationship with zero examination of what that will mean for Quaid who has effectively been professionally leapfrogged by Grace. Quaid then becomes a Hollywood numskull and socks Grace one and then becomes a Hollywood hero in the board room and everyone goes what a hero with no examination of complexities.Cod radical."
3,Timing is everything in life,"I think the statement towards the end of the movie sums everything up, ""timing is everything in life."" I like the theme in this movie, the theme of old age versus youth, technology changing corporate America, but some values don't change, it shows the stablity of jobs, how time changes so quickly, new beginnings and endings in life. I believe the movie does a good job of addressing that. However, I did not like Topher Grace's character, I know you're not suppose to like him, but I just found him to be boring. Dennis Quaid's character embodies the vision of a hard-working, American father supporting his family. The best scene is the confrontation between the father and the daughter, it shows how time changes things. This was a light and warm movie, but it wasn't exactly great. It had it's moments though. Worth watching once."
4,Good Values,"This is one of those films that reinforces good values and ""what life is all about"". I like the way it ended -- more realistic than most films. The acting is pretty good and it moves along at a pretty good clip. Quaid is exceptional and you really wish he was your dad, or you were him. Too few people like that in the corporate world."
1,Definately a let down,"After seeing the previews for this movie, I was definately expecting a wonderful movie. I anticipated to see a movie that incorporated family and business issues, along with a romantic storyline.The movie was very good until the end, although somewhat slow at times. The conclusion was not what I expected, but not a good way. The problem was, there really was no conclusion.I'm upset that I just wasted 2 hours on the movie, for a riduculous ending such as that. If I would've known it ended as it did, there is no way you would ever get me to see it.On a good note though, the soundtrack was incredible, with artists such as Damien Rice and Sountrack of Our lives. And Topher Grace is beautiful as always."
1,negative 20 stars,"I received this DVD from my DVD club because I forgot to cancel the director selection of the month. I knew as soon as I took it out of the box I was in trouble. The cover picture is horrible beyond words, those stupid poses! I knew I was about to watch a horrible Hollywood assembly line piece of garbage. Upon watching I wanted to wretch. How did they talk these actors into this so called fim?? I went and traded it at my local pc games/cd/dvd store for 2 horror films.Avoid this at all cost...."
1,Horrible,"This movie has no plot, dry acting, and is impossible to even tollerate watching. Please if you buy this moview do so to destroy it."
3,Moderate,"This isn't the greatest film you'll ever watch, but I was pleasantly suprised because I had thought it'd be awful. Good performances overall, but nothing spectacular. I like the discussion of corporate politics in the film, but such discussion would be furthered with character we'd actually care about."
4,Good Choice... but...,The first two movies are good and worth the money you pay for all three. The final movie was not all that great. I would give that movie one star. But because the other two were good I gave the entire DVD 4 stars. They are funny and romantic...
3,As was expected,"This movie got plenty of advance positive press. I heard about it on TV, on NPR, in magazines, and everyone was hyped for it. Great premise: 20-something rising star Topher Grace becomes the boss of the 50-something Dennis Quaid in a company take-over.What do you expect from this kind of movie? Weirdness over the age different and role reversal? Check. Grace is going to think he knows it all, but he actually has a lot to learn from Quaid? Check. Grace is going to relate to Quaid's daughter better than he does to Quaid? Check. The universe is going to be righted at the end of the movie, and both Grace and Quaid are going to go off in the world changed and better people? Check.This movie delivered exactly what one would expect if they know the premise. It was formulaic in that respect. There is still some excellent acting and some great drama, but it is all pretty straightforward. I wasn't moved or surprised in any way."
4,Excellent....:),"Some of these reviews I just cannot understand!! This was a great movie. The story was nice and steady, and it really kept the viewer interested!! This is one of those films that you can actually have the family watch and not be embarassed...to be honest...the content is such that I would allow my 10 year old to watch it...:) Funny, smart, and just down right good...that is what this movie is!! Trust me!!!"
3,A feel good movie.,"This one's about a guy who is the head worker at a big sports magazine and is married with two kids, with one daughter just starting college and has a third on the way. One day, his company gets sold to a bigger one, and now a 26-year-old is his boss! In odd plot twists and big fun, his boss ends up dating his college daughter."
1,Forgot how boring this movie is!,"I bought this movie and had not seen it since it came out. I regret buying it! It's pretty boring and just plain stupid! If you really want to see it, rent it don't buy it!"
1,Arrrrgggh-A Movie WITHOUT an ending!!!,"This movie was Okay up until the end....it has none. If you are someone who likes closure in your movies, DON'T see this one. This is what I like to refer to as the ""draw your own conclusion"" ending. I guess they are looking to make a sequel. They started several situations, but didn't give any of them any ending!!! It ended NOWHERE!!! I DESTEST writers and directors that make these kinds of movies. It's ashamed, because there is a VERY talented cast wasted on a movie with no ending!!!!"
1,Not all that good,"Was okay - but not satisfying. The ending was abrupt. I guess I expected a little more romance, so I was disappointed. Will not be joining my collection of movies and wouldn't waste time watching again."
5,An absolute must-buy for any self-respecting Goa fan,"To save yourself some time, stop reading this immediately, and order this album right away. After you've done this, go back to this page and read further.So, here's the deal: this is the BEST thing that happened to us since Astral Projection's Another World. Both CDs in the album are absolutely marvelous, and they truly live up to the ""Greatest Goa Trance"" hits title, delivering smooth trance impact. Expertly picked mixed tracks will carry you far away and beyond. 3rd ""bonus sampler CD"" is somewhat of a lackluster, but who really cares -- at the current price this is literally a steal!! If you're looking for a Goa fix, look no further."
2,the GREATEST?,this is a boring compilation. it sounds like the same song for over 100 minutes of pure embarrassment. and it's oh-so cheesy. this will sound VERY dated in just a few months. certainly not worth my $. i have already returned my copy! avoid!
1,Ordered 120 only got 5????,"The product description states ""sold in packs of 24 only.1 order=24 bags""I odered 5 and only recived 5 plastic bags! Plus it cost $6.29 to ship 5 bags in a great big box! I am still waiting on the other 115 bags!!!"
1,Don't waste the money,"This one is only for completists. The recording level is strangely low, so that only a strong audio system or listening indoors with headphones can give you a strong sound. This is especially problematic since the chorus is incomprehensible. The performers are conservatory types most of whom can't act, which makes it too bad that the producers for some reason record the dialogue along with the score. And -- that dialogue is what makes this a 2-CD set; this is by no means a full rendition of the score. There is clearly a lot of missing dance music and reprises; there is about half as much music as you get in, say, JAY's STUDENT PRINCE double-CD, and much less than on Encores' NEW MOON recording. This recording gives no notion of why THE VAGABOND KING was such a hit in its day, and most buyers will be better off waiting for someone else to really do the score proud."
2,A pretty film that hasn't aged well,"Alas, in the year 2001 this film does not appear to have aged very well. It is full of the type of moralizing and philosophizing that was so the rage -- especially in France -- in the '60s and '70s, which now seems hopelessly naive and irrelevant. Plot? Characterizations? Linear storyline? Who needs these when we're expounding on the Major Issues of Our Times!? Prettily filmed, with an attractive cast (most of whom don't get to do all that much), but ultimately a fine example of cinematic navel-gazing. I liked this film when it first came out -- but now, for the life of me, I couldn't tell you why."
5,Extremely helpful in understanding intermediate reformer exercises,"Have all of the essential exercises on the reformer mastered? This gives you detailed instruction and demonstrations of nearly all of the intermediate level exercises. These exercises require noticeably more strength and coordination than the essentials, but none are impossibly hard.This is one of the Stott DVDs designed for instructors, so the approach is more comprehensive than a regular routine would be, as every exercise is covered (not something you would typically do in a single workout), and it's discussed as how you would help a client. That said, the step-by-step demonstration of each exercise is extremely useful."
3,Good DVD for Instructors,"This DVD is designed for instructors to use/learn in their classes. I found it informative and have used it a couple of times to exercise, but would have preferred one designed for consumers."
5,Fantastic,I was so glad I ordered this product. Anyone familiar with a colostomy knows the fear of odor around other people. This product completely eliminates odor. I wish I would have ordered it sooner.
3,"Wonderful book, terrible binding","Like other reviewers I am completely enthusiastic about this book. I can't begin to describe how it enriches my spiritual life everyday. I don't know how to add to what has already been written about the value of the content.However, I feel compelled to write this review because this paperback edition is so horribly bound. The binding cracks and the pages start to fall out under even the most gentle use. This is a big problem because you will want to read this book every day for the rest of your life. Please do not buy this paperback edition. Buy the leather bound edition: http://www.amazon.com/Divine-Intimacy-Gabriel-Magdalen-O-C-D/dp/1905574436 Yes it costs a little more but it is more than worth it."
4,,Thank you. nothiing to write due to have not read book yet. Our professor has decided not to use this book.
1,Ordered one product and got sent another (twice)!,"Unfortunately I cannot rate this particular product, because of the two times I have ordered it, I have received different Toi Sauce products. The product pictured and described is for a vegetarian pad thai sauce but I have received a non- vegetarian (i.e. anchovy based) all purpose sauce. I ended up donating the orders due to cost and hassle of shipping ."
2,Not that great,"The book has data but is written as if it was for a school paper with new words and every other line refering you to others work. This is a texbook used by some schools however, it gets a D- in helping people understand the COP programs. Try another book for learning and use this one for your reports"
3,Worth Checking Out (3 Stars),"The Presence consists of MC Cirrus and MC/Producer Nasa. Their latest release, Common Man's Anthems, is worth checking out if you want to hear some rap that touches on topics like 9/11, global warming, and other topics of relevance that most rappers seem to overlook. With the exception of two songs, all of the production is handled by Nasa, and as a result, the album doesn't really shift gears enough to grab your attention. It's good, but nothing out of this atmosphere and the two emcees are just above average. Thus making this sonically creative album pretty forgettable. You won't be mad that you bought it, but you won't be blown away by it either.Guests include Rob Sonic, Aesop Rock, Masai Bey, & Karniege"
3,"Its ok, but far from great!","I have owned this set for a number of years now and I have found it has quite a few shortcomings. First of all, the cuts produced by this set are a bit rough. The bottoms of the dado cuts are not as smooth as I would like and there is some tearout, especially if you are using the set on plywood. These blades also seemed to dull rather quickly (during normal use). There are a few paper shims included, but I rarely use these anymore since I basically only use this set for ""rough"" work now (building backyard stuff from treated lumber).I recommend that you spend a bit more for a Freud dado set..."
3,Fair value for a fair price,The 6 inch stacked dado blade set was reasonably priced . I was disappointed to find paper shims that stack between the blades for desired thickness though. I suppose one gets what one pays for .
5,great!,"It was excelent! It arrived on time and it also was shipped into a small box, due to that I could avoid a bigger billing from my courier company"
2,Non-AMerican american,"Despite being titled ""Vermont American"" this product was not made in America. So far the blades work fine but I have only used them in one project thus far."
1,DO NOT BUY,I have been a manager for a retail petstore for 15 yrs. I have extensive knowledge in aquatic life. Our store has purchased these pumps for commercial use as well as for customer purchase. We will no longer carry lifeguard products due to the lack of quality and lack of customer service. These quiet one pumps are made with plastic shafts instead of stainless steel shafts. When you have a power outage and then the power surge kicks back on the shaft cracks.When you call lifeguard they refuse to correct the problem and tell you to send it back at your own cost. A man named Neil works there and will not even consider any type of compensation for these pumps and also will not hesitate to hang up on you.These pumps will not last you more than a year the shafts will crack.I know because i have many upset customers with these pumps. Be aware that you may give this good ratings when first purchased but you will not be happy in the long run.
3,It was OK,A combination ghost story-cop mystery that started out pretty good but then began to lose my interest about a third of the way through. It did pick up again towards the end. Good finish to the story.
3,An ok horror story,"A police officer slowly converts to a believer in ghosts as he tries to solve a case of a serial murderer, one he thought he sent to the electric chair. This is not at the quality of Hynd's ""Ghosts"" but is still a decent read. The plot is a bit predictable though and the resolution is not the strongest. The writer is a fine one. Worth a read."
3,"Decent book, not 5 stars","I'm not sure why this book has garnered such fantastic press. It's a decent read, especially if you enjoy a cop thriller with a hint of the supernatural. But it's also a pretty standard read that doesn't offer anything especially new or exciting to either the genre of the thriller or the supernatural. The main character is well developed and the plot will keep you engaged; you won't find anything overtly awful about it. The writing is competent. I wouldn't warn anyone away from this book, but don't go into it expecting to have your world rocked. It's a bit too pedestrian for that."
1,Save your money.,"The editing was terrible and the story, while it started out well, really bombed as it evolved. The portrayal of the ghost charaters were so out there that it was ridiculous. Sorry, really disappointed in the book."
5,A truly sensational masterpiece!,"The Story of Soul series captured the essence of human nature and captivated me with a fascinating combination of thriller, romance, mystery, theology, sci-fi, supernatural, mythology, and metaphysics...just to name a few. The stories seemed to come alive and launch out of the book, one can't help but put oneself into the story. Just open up your mind and let the story take you for a ride, you will be surprised at what you will find."
5,My best days are ahead of me.,"David's program works. It's been six months since I contacted David Klein. I had been sick for 1 1/2 years before I came across his website. I had been to many doctors without help. A GI had told me to be realistic, that there was no name for my condition and no cure and that I would have live with pain the rest of my life. I followed the diet in the book, along with some counseling, and I feel that my best days are ahead of me.Mukwaano - Sacramento, California"
2,A biased opinion,"Well, basically, I realize the author is trying to help those with major health problems to get serious about changing eating habits.I get that. But not at the expense of truth and not able back up his claims by considering all angles to a case. Not going to convince those who might want to consider veganism by trying to scare them or lay down ""truths"" with out backing up claim from every possible angle. It gets a little weird and unbalanced from a mental standpoint. Not practical for those who clarity of thought and honesty."
1,Sorry I purchased this book,"This book is such a drastic way to change your diet that it was way over my head. I had hoped this book would really help me but instead it confused me.I felt like ""what can I eat""???? To go to a ""vegan"" type of diet would be a HUGE change for me and of course my family. I wish I could have gotten a refund. Would not recommend..."
3,Wishy washy,"This book pretty much tells you the opposite of everything you read and learn about diet for IBD. Every food in this book is raw and highly fiberous. I read the entire book because I am into holistic healing and used to be vegan, before my Crohn's was diagnosed. Now it is too difficult to eat this way and it def does not work if you are having any symptoms of a flare up. I am yet to reach remission but I don't feel that this diet would be very helpful when I do, as I used to be vegan and ate very similarly to this and ended up with a very severe flare-up. Try it and if it works for you, great! But I don't put a lot of faith in the concepts in this book. Good luck to all who are healing!"
4,Good Signal (strange behaviour with Nokia),"I have used this one for almost a year now. I use it with Nokia E60, and it is good in gaining signal, but the strange thing is that I can't synch to it more than one time, and then I have to delete it from my bluetooth devices in order to use it again. I find this really strange."
4,buen equipo,"excelente producto recomendado deacuerdo al fabricante, rapido seguro y oportuno vendedor, oferta y disponibilidada garantizada, tiempo de entrega acordado al destino solicitado."
5,GPS works very well - compact size,I bought the Holux to use with an Aoka-Tec bluetooth adapter for geologging with my Nikon cameras. The Holux is compact and has great battery life and acquires the satellite fixes very quickly. It has a sleep function to conserve the camera's battery life.The different LED lights make it easy to see what the status is of the Holux and to monitor charging and battery level. Bluetooth is effective for use with any other Bluetooth device so the Holux can be used along with a netbook to have access to a full range of services.The lithium-ion battery charges using a USB connection so no wall adapter is needed and overseas I don't need a power converter either.Holux makes it very easy to download and install updates to improve the performance of the Holux unlike the other GPS units I have bought. I prefer to deal with manufacturers that do issue updates and continue to serve their customers long after the warranty is up.
3,not for person on diet,"it does not taste like banana, and more grease than I thought, so if you want to find a real banana tast chips this may not be your choice. Even though it is not too sweet, but it contains huge calories, so if you are on diet this should not be on your list either."
2,They're not good at all,These are the worst banana chips I've had. They were very greasy and loaded with calories and a bad flavor to them except for the grease.The quality of them were not close to the great quality that I have found in others.
3,decent kitchen tool,"It's pretty, functional, and relatively hardy. I do wish the hole on the top were a bit bigger."
2,Didn't help,I have tried many different acne products. This one was like all the others - did not help eliminate or reduce the number of breakouts I had and it did not reduce or diminish any of the acne scars I have. I am very disappointed because I had high hopes for this one.
4,Still using seems to be helping,"I bought this for my daughter who has problems with acne. She has tried many different things none have worked well, or they work for a few weeks then stop and acne goes back to the way it was before. She has been using it for a while now and it still seems to be helping."
4,Seems to be effective,"I've been using this for a minimum once a day for a month. I do notice a reduced redness in my skin were I get acne - mostly my chin. I can't say scientifically that it works, but I notice a big difference in the redness, but only after I take it within 12 hours. If I don't use it within 24 hours, the redness comes back. However, my recent scars seem to be healing quickly. I would say that it can't hurt to give it a try for the great price they offer."
1,No results,"This product didn't improve any conditions on my face, plus it has silicone in it and who wants that on there face, that clogs your pores."
1,Completely useless...don't waste your money,It doesn't do what it claims to do. I feel like I just wasted my money. It doesn't work at all. If you want to try ..buy something like Clinique either from Macy's or Amazon whatever is cheaper...cos that's gonna work on your acne not this!
3,Not sure,Have been using for about a week. Haven't seen any difference. But at least it's not expensive. Like the package too.
5,The effect is very good ~!,"The effect is very good, more than the imagination, amazing. Bedtime daub to scar mark it, and the next day he found blain to imprint desalination many, very good things, and recommended."
3,No scar treatment,"This is a usual acne treatment , I purchased this as it said it was a scar treatment. Most acne solutions work differently for different people , having understood that , this cream is a salicyclic acid treatment and focuses only on ACNE and not on SCAR"
1,Did not help my scars at all...made skin worse,This product did not help my scars at all. It actually made my skin worse. Breakouts were worse and red ares became inflamed and more irritated.
2,Scar,This product did nothing for my scar but made it flaky. I would not reccommend this product to anyone.
3,"Princess Warrior: bad movie, good catfights","Amazon Queen Ovule teleports to Earth to escape a rebellion caused by her evil sister Curette. She arrives on Earth, wins a wet t-shirt contest and meets Bob an uninteresting male lead.Soon her sister plus two toadies arrive looking for Ovule to finish her off. But end up getting arrested by police officers. With the villains now handcuffed in the back of a police cruiser. Bob and Ovule have all the time in the world to develop the boring love subplot.Eventually Curette escapes and finds Ovule and the two women fight for control of their planet.The high lights of Princess Warrior were the light saber fights, the wet t-shirt contest, and that long Kelly Bundy style slugfest between Ovule and Curette. The movie sucks but if you can find a copy that's cheap I say buy it."
1,Don't ever buy this!,"This is one of the worst movies ever made. And it isn't even funny. Two sisters rules an empire (that we won't see anything from), and when teir mother dies the evil sister want to kill the nice sister.The nice sister escapes to earth arriving, by pure coincidence, to a topless bar. Then the girls run around the rest of the movie, trying to be sexy, not succeeding.The dialog is like a bad pornoflick, the set budget doesn't exist, it is more like as if the actors are walking around a town and some guy with videocamera runs after them. Can't have cost more than 100-200$ to make."
5,I feel good!,"I started using this product about 2 or 3 weeks ago at the recommendation of a weight loss book. I can't say that in this time its helped me lose any weight, but I can tell you that I feel so much better when it comes to handling and dealing with stress! Not sure if it is all in my head, or from the help of this pill but whatever it is, I'll continue to take."
5,great time saver!,"In planning a trip to Africa, this Online Travel helped make the experience easy and fun! On one page I found ALL the major airlines serving Africa (including websites & 800 numbers). Simple to use, including ample space for taking notes. Gives a great outline of all the countries of the world (so many I had never heard of!) and a quality selection of their truly creative websites. Bon voyage!"
4,Magic stuff from one of the pioneers of British Blues,"Baldry was in at the start of the British Blues scene, from the days back in the late 1950s when he sang at the Roundhouse in Soho with the likes of Alexis Korner and Cyril Davies. This set does true justice to Long John, covering his early electric blues period through to his more soul and pop-oriented days. Highlights for me are ""Five Long Years"", ""Bad Luck Soul"", ""The Drifter"" and ""S.O.S."" I have played this set quite a lot and continually find something new to enjoy each time. My only criticism is the inclusion of rather superfluous 'bonus' mono/stereo mixes of tracks that appear very soon before! However, go out and buy this and you surely won't be disappointed!"
3,OK,"This was for my husband who thought it was okay. It was probably something big to listen to in it's era, but today it's just not the same."
3,Eiliff - 'Eiliff / Girlrls' 2-CD Import,"A double CD import of German krautrock band, Eiliff's only two albums they ever released. Disc one is of their self-titled 1971 effort, which definitely requires an 'acquired taste'. Two better tracks are ""Byrds-Night Of The Seventh Day"" and the twenty-minute epic ""Suite"". As for their 1972 follow-up 'Girlrls', you need to check out that separate review I did."
1,"Ugh, ZERO stars!","I have had these pans since March of 2008 and really liked them at first. For the past year or more though, the handles on them have been cracking and twisting. When I pick up a pan to pour something out of it, the handle twists and I can't tilt the pan. I have contacted Kitchenaid about this issue and they have been less than helpful. In order to have my pans replaced I would have to mail them all in. That would be very expensive, and I would have no pans to cook with in the meantime. I emailed them a photo of one of the badly cracked pans and they said that they can only replace two pans with a photo and the rest would have to be mailed in. I find that extremely ridiculous and frustrating. Do not buy this set, it will not hold up over time and Kitchenaid will be of no help to you."
5,After 31 years I treated myself to the perfect set of pots and pans,"After 31 years I began having trouble with the handles on my old set of pots and pans. I went on a search to find a high quality but a not too expensive replacement set. I searched consumer reports, Sam's Club, Costco, numerous stores and the reviews I found on this site and purchased the KitchenAid set. The look and feel was just what I wanted, well made, heavy but not too heavy. I used them to prepare my Thanksgiving meal and was very satified. They were perfect"
4,I use this every day,"I am very happy with this set, solid and easy to clean. I use at least one or two pieces every day. It arrived very quickly- faster than I thought."
2,Kitchen Aid Stainless Steel pan: doesn't last that long,"I bought my set of pots and pans in February of this year. Let's just say they don't hold up so well. One month later, my fry pan (the one I use the most) was starting to discolor. No big deal, since it still got the job done. Now, a little over six months later, the pan is practically useless! I used it one day to cook some bacon, I had to pry the bacon off, and what got left behind stayed there. I soaked the pan for hours, and then again for days, and now I'm convinced that it will never be clean again. Anything that touches the pan fuses itself there permanently! The rest of the pots are just fine, but I'm thinking that since the pan saw the most use, it's only a (short) matter of time before they all end up like this. I got the set at a discount, so I guess I got my money's worth, but I was expecting to get a few more years of use out of my pan. I've upgraded to allclad, I hear it's worth the money, and after my experience, I sure hope so!"
5,Good product,"Showed up on time, great cookware. Use it daily, hand wash. Shouldn't have any problems with this set. Most likely the only stainless steel cookware set you'll ever need to buy."
4,great for induction cooking,"Got these for our new induction cook top and we love them! Easy grip handles and lids are cool to the touch and the pots work well. The skillets are a bit hard to clean since you shouldn't use steel wool, but they are a great buy! They look great and we like them a lot!"
5,A Quality Product at a Great Price!,"This was a late Christmas present from my wife, and I love it! I've always wanted aluminum cookware,but could never justify the cost. The price from Amazon on this 10 piece set made it too attractive to passup. I own a KitchenAid mixer and food processor, and have found their quality and performance to beexcellent. Their cookware is every bit as good as their other products! After cooking with their cookwarefor 8 months I can say that it was money well spent! I had to reduce my cooking times by about 15%because aluminum cooks so much more evenly and quickly. I burned a few things in the beginning,but the cleaner, ""Barkeeper's Friend,"" restored the finish to like new. The only complaint I have is thepots go from 3 quart to 8 quart. A 5 or 6 quart pot in between would have been nice. Other than that Ihave no complaints. 5 stars and highly recommended!"
5,Awesome Set,"I LOVE this set. For the price, I couldn't believe how nice this set is. The pans are great. Things cook evenly and the pans clean up easily."
1,18/0 stainless steel NOT 18/10 --- save your money!,"Product is described as 18/10 stainless steel. I bought it based on this description. When I received the item I looked carefully at the box and it says nothing about it's grade. I opened the box and looked at the bottom of the pan--no marking. I called Kitchen Aid, gave them the product name and item number on the box and they told me the item is 18/0 ZERO--not 18/10--there's no nickel in the item at all. The higher the nickel content the higher the protection from corrosion. These are going back."
5,Nice Stainless Set!,"I bought these pans about a year ago. I've been using nonstick most of my life. The last time I tried to use stainless everything stuck to the pan. Turned out the problem was that I didn't know how to cook with it. (All those hours spent watching cooking shows have helped.) I use these pans for most of my cooking now and haven't had a problem with food sticking.The piece I least like is the 8 qt. stockpot. It's tall & narrow. I think roasts and chickens fit into a shorter/wider stockpot better. But, that's just a personal preference. I'm pleased with the purchase, especially at the lightning deal price."
4,Very nice set for the price!,"I haven't used this set yet, but it is a nice, durable feeling set that is weighted just about right for me. Not too heavy, not feather light. The lids sit down inside the pots, not over the tops, which I like. Once again, I haven't used the set yet, but I think for the price(just over $100 on sale and free shipping from Amazon)I won't be disappointed."
5,Fast delivery,I ordered this product late Saturday and received it the following Wednesday! That was much faster than I expected! The cookware looks and feels great! I'm a happy camper!
3,beautiful but not great,"beautiful set of pots and great design, but not what I expected, both the pots and pans make almost anything you cook will stick, stain anything and are difficult to clean, are the wonderful chef pots I thought"
1,Worst cook ware ever,"Hi I recently moved in to a new home and decided to upgrade everything in my new kitchen including my cookware. When I saw the listing on Amazon for this set it looked to good to be true it was. I have been cooking for many years and have never had such problems with food sticking like this cookware sticks. The worse part is that most of the food stains will not come off the pans, leaving me with very unattractive looking pans. I have tried everything to get it off; I am cooking normal foods nothing out of the ordinary. I even have started cooking with more extra virgin olive oil to make the food not stick, still no luck. I wish I could get a refund; I have gone back to my cheap pans."
2,KitchenAid Gourmet Essentials Stainless,I am very dissapointed with this set. Everything sticks to them. I guess I will go back to non-stick!
4,"Good, Not Great","These are sturdy,dependable Kitchen Aid Cookware.NOT non stick, should've looked closer. Great deal for the price no doubt, Eggs are a bit difficult to clean, but overall very pleased with the purchase"
4,KitchenAid Gourmet Essentials,"Product arrived on time and in good shape, although the outside box was damaged and oddly packed."
1,Can't take the heat,"I have several of the pots and pans in this collection but I am writing specifically about the 18/20 8-quart pot. This pot is unable to work properly because when I left it on the stove at the highest setting and left it there for eight hours, it was not functional afterward. I tried to shake off some of the ashes from the bottom of the pot and the bottom fell out of it."
5,great set of pots & pans,"This set is every bit as good as my All-Clad pieces but a lot less expensive. Actually, the handles are better on the Kitchenaid pans. I highly recommend purchasing this product."
4,"Excellent cookware, hard to clean.","I love these pots and pans. I was tired of replacing my nonstick cookware constantly due to scratches so decided to try stainless instead. I was not disappointed, they cook meats so much better. The only trades from non-stick was having to use more oils so that foods don't stick and the pans are definately harder to clean. Much better to clean right away or soaking right away and baking soda works the best."
5,Great set at a great price,"I saw this as a Gold Box special and wasn't sure whether to purchase or not without seeing it. The reviews looked positive and I decided to purchase it and am glad I did. The weight of the pots and pans is great. Also, the price being on a Gold Box special was even better than hoped for (over 1/2 off) listed price. I'm replacing parts of my Calaphan All Clad set that have kind got worn. Also, relatives said that some of the All Clad pieces were too heavy to use. These are just a bit lighter and better balanced. I also like the medium sized pot as that size wasn't in my previous set and sometimes that was the size really needed."
5,Absolutely Love them,"I am so glad I took the time and read the reviews before I bought one of the celebrity endorsed brands at my local store. The Pots and pans are fabulous, they do everything that they promise. I am going to continue adding to this brand."
2,It stick,The set was purchased based on other peoples good reviews.Problem: metal surface is not polished (kind of ruff) and food tends to stick during cooking to the walls more then to to other stainless steel utensils.It was a mistake to purchase this set.
3,Mildly disappointed with this cookware,"This cookware is NOT dishwasher safe! Otherwise, I have been pleased with it. For the price, it is acceptable, but I expected a KitchenAid product to be safe in my KitchenAid dishwasher.Fast FREE delivery from Amazon!"
3,KitchenAid Cookware,"Looked great, received in a very timely fashion but after using only a couple of times the pans spot even though hand washed."
4,Stainless steel pots,Great value for your money! Would purchase again! Love how heavy the bases are to ensure even cooking of food.
4,Great non-non-stick cookware.,"If you're like me, you (generally) revile non-stick cookware. It's fussy and can't handle regular (ab)use at best, and kills birds with toxic fumes at worst. These pans have been a great addition to my kitchen. I would proffer as a mea culpa that I do keep one small, non-stick skillet for eggs, but otherwise, I use these daily. They're solid and a really good value.My only knock is that I would prefer a slightly larger saucepan between the medium sized one and the stock pot, the latter of which is a chore to haul out just to cook pasta, and the former of which is too small to handle the volume of water necessary for the task."
3,"Bought for my wife, but she doesn't like the set","It is a very nice set. Has all of the basic items, lids fit well and appears to be very nice quality. However, my wife doesn't like them. She packed everything back in the box and put into storage in the basement. She has a number of complaints including the weight of the pots (they are a little on the heavy side) and she indicates that the handles get hot and/or are uncomfortable. As this is a subjective assessment, am sharing it for your information. I still like them, believe them to be nice quality and would like to use them, but..."
3,"great set, BUT..........","We bought this set for our family hoping to replace the old set that we had. The old set was not the Kitchen Aid brand, but due to extensive usage it started to show the petroleum like spots on the interiors of the pots bottoms. As we broke in the first Kitchen Aid pot it start showing exactly same kind of petroleum like spots. We freaked out! Apparently for no reason, because all other items were all right. So out of 4 pots one was defective. The Amazon wants us to return a whole set,which can be very expensive.After all, this could be a great set of cookware if it would not contain these kind of surprises, which can get very expensive if one will try to obtain perfectly good set."
4,Great product,"This set came highly recommended by Consumers Report so I gave it a shot. So far, it is living up to expectations. I like the cooking quality, weight (very solid), appearance (sleek) and durability. I've had this set for a few months now and absolutely love it.BTW, there appeared to be some tarnish after the first use of the frying pan so I initially rated this 4 stars, but it turned out to be a thin film of oil that came off on its own after the third wash. I'd change my rating to 5 stars, but the scale appears to be locked down."
5,Best yet,I was replacing sturdy 40 year-old pots and pans with reluctance. This set is even better and likely to outlive me by far! Finish is so smooth I just swish it out to clean - no dishwasher needed. I like the cool handles and the fact I can use it in the oven to 400 degrees. Very pleased and recommend highly.
4,Great pots,"These KitchenAid pots are great. They are heavy and cook evenly, with cool handles for pots and lids. I only wish there were other pots in this style to be bought. The sizes are great, but I would also like a steamer, a larger saute pan, and some extras in the same sizes."
4,Kitchenaid cookware set,I bought this for my wife and she loves it. The only draw backs are that you have to grease the pans or the food will stick and it doesnt come with a wok. I priced the wok seperately and it costs about 40% of what the entire set cost me. Overall it is a good product.
4,Mostly love it,"We purchased this set after much deliberation and research. Consumer reports find them best in the SS category. We found that although we do like them, I was instantly disappointed upon opening the box to see a solid SS lid. The picture, after looking at the product's website and Amazon's site seemed as though the lids were clear glass. Not so. Also, they seem to keep a stain of even boiled water after use, coming out a tad dirty looking after going thru the dishwasher. After a light scrubbing with steel wool pads, they are fine. Word to the wise: I originally wanted to purchase a better non-stick set but realized that you could not mash potatoes or 'brown' items in those. The regular SS is still the best cooking tool for all-around use."
2,Wayne is better than this.,"Didn't know this album of Mr. Newton but the review posted here help...sorry it did. This is Wayne's older voice and has changed but the material is weak, the album has a worn out, dry, tired feel to it (to my ears).The length of the album may be just fine at a very short 27 minutes. Sorry Wayne, love ya but I could barely sit through this one."
1,Do not buy Toshiba,"TV set ran okay for 13 months with minimum usage and the lamp burned, which cost about $300 to replace. Toshiba advertised that its lamp would last over 8500 hours, what a liar. Google Toshiba DLP lamp problem, you will find it is a very common known issue for Toshiba TVs. $300/year for lamps is too expensive. DO NOT buy Toshiba."
4,"Toshiba 56"" DLP TV","Pros:-Great picture-Nice size-Easy remoteCons:-Difficult on-screen setup-TV Guide won't just ""pick up and go""-Back looks somewhat cheapWe just love this TV! It's picture quality and size is amazing, along with the low price! I did have some problems with it however: the on-screen setup was a hassle, the TV Guide won't just automatically pick up the device and launch, and the back of the set looks somewhat cheap. Also, the pre-fit stand is a piece of junk. It looks like metal, but it's actually particle board with the components supported by quarter inch thick glass that is very flimsy. Don't get the stand, but get the TV!"
3,"Great TV, bad lamp","We bought this TV from a local bricks & mortar in May and have been delighted with it. Great picture, great color, etc. BUT last night there was a loud pop and the screen went black. The lamp blew after a little more than three months. Luckily we bought the extended warranty and a repair guy will be out on Monday to replace the lamp.I would encourage you to get the extended warranty to cover the lamps that Toshiba has had problems with for about a year with these LCD TVs.The TV overall would get 5 stars, but this lamp blowing after a few months brings it down to 3 stars."
5,For Professional Only..,"This is the best high speed buffer you can buy. I have used them for years in the past to buff out cars. Dropped them, run them over with cars, burnt the edges of paint on cars with them and made a lot of money with mine. I have had Makita and DeWalt in the past and had problems with both. The only problem I had with the Milwakee is the electrical cord shorting out. That was after years of abuse. The balance and weight of the machine also feels better. If you are an auto bodyman, painter or detailer, this is a must have tool. If you just want to wax your car you don't need this. You also can damage your paint if you don't know how to use it. If you do know how to use it, may be the last one you'll ever need."
4,Attractive book and recipes,"This book is very attractively printed on thick quality paper in bright and lively colors. There is about one recipe per 2 pages since each recipe is accompanied by a photograph of the presentation and of some preparation steps. I wish publisher had posted some pictures and sample pages from this book so that you could see the beauty of it.Most of the recipes are quite easy to make and are attractive not only to the vegetarians (since this book actually features many recipes made with different vegetables, not just tofu and stuff). I especially like that this book has ""Special occasion"" section with more sophisticated recipes like ""Buckwheat Blinis with Mushroom Caviar"" and ""Grilled Vegetable Terrine"".I would've given this book 5 stars, but I wish it would have more potato recipes and not simplistic ones like Garlic Mashed Potatoes. So 4 and a half stars for me."
5,Awesome CD!,"This CD is great! I love singing along to the karake tracks. Two perfect girls is kinda funny and these songs have great beats! If you have this DON'T BUY POKEMON 3! It has the same stuff! All in all, this is a great CD to add to any pokèfan's collection!"
3,Well well well...,"This sounds familiar, doesn't it? If you have this CD, don't buy the Pokemon 3 soundtrack, it has the exact same songs on it (only less karaoke tracks) If you have Pokemon 3, don't buy this. If you have both already, I truly pity you. Although this C.D. has like, 2 tracks on it that aren't found on pokemon 3, the same is true the other way around. I don't think it's worth it if you have pokemon 3."
4,A KID'S REVIEW,"Well, i loved He Drives Me Crazy. It really does talk about Misty's secret crush on Ash. Though it was quite obivious that Misty loved Ash, Ash was, shall we say, slightly thick-headed to not notice that. If you noticed, Misty agrees to what Ash says first, then Brock follows suit. I really wished that things were better for Misty and Ash. Well back on track, You will really LOVE the song ""He Drives Me Crazy"". Ash was really mean to leave Misty and go to another region when she cant come. She was there in every step and he rewards her like this(Yes, i did see that episode). This song is like a continuation from ""Misty's Song"" which is sung by Misty when Ash is asleep. I did not buy this CD but my Cousin did and after he got another CD gave this to me.I really think Ash is moving through friends too fast. First, Misty, then May now Dawn. Sheesh. Any way,Thanks for your kind attention,Good bye and love Pokemon!"
4,Not as good as the others?,"Well, I have all of the American Pokémon CD (only a few of the imports, sadly).. and I'd have to say, I didn't like this quite as much as the other ones. Most of the songs were pretty catchy.. but I liked the other CDs better. I'd reccomend listening to them before listening to this one."
1,Short String,"This is a pull toy, right? Well, you can't pull it no matter how short you are since the string is about 8 inches long. I would send it back but I lost the box. Worthless toy."
1,Curious George Plays baseball,"This book, and all of the books derived from the movies, are far worse than the average goerge books. Story is very simple, very brief, and has no creativity. Both of our kids are huge george fans (they even liked this one ok), but this is a pretty weak book."
2,wayyyyyy too much money,"what a disappointment!! The 2 ""chefs"" were boring and very low energy.The tips and tricks were just barely ok.... I have made pizzas for about 20 years and really was hoping to get some info for the $26.99 .... but was very dissapointed instead.Instead I was just getting tired watching the boring, very unprofessional presentation.Maybe it's good for people who have no knowledge about pizza making, but for me it was a total waste of money."
3,Great Product BUT.....,The shampoo is a great product and it cleanses well. The thing is that it dries your hair out. My scalp felt refreshed after washing but I had to follow up with a moisturing conditioner and leave in in order to relieve the dryness.
5,USED TO INSTALL DIPOLE ANTENNA TO SONY RECEIVER,"I USED THIS ADAPTER TO INSTALL A DIPOLE ANTENNA TO A SONY AV RECEIVER STR-DH510 AND IT WORKED PERFECTLY! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. FM RECEPTION WENT FROM 2 STATIONS TO OVER A DOZEN, FM SIGNAL STRENGTH WAS GREATLY IMPROVED!"
4,Does what it is suposd to do.,"Its an adaptor. Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah, Blah Beefart why me no more"
4,TV Cable Connector,This F type balun connector met my need and connected (adapted) a 300 ohm TV lead to a Tuner- amplifier coaxial input.
1,Steel letter stamp set,"The product received is not the same showed in the picture. Also the set came without the letter ""C"" instead it came with two (2) ""D"". For me the item is almost useless, like a typewriter with a letter missing. Bad buy."
5,unabashed,"I have been coming back to this album time and time again since 2005, when they blew me away live. This album has everything you need for a thrill-ride of unabashed, vehement rock. RTT covers the gamut of emotions all while constantly surging back and forth between pop and dissonance and never really resolving that issue. However, this 'issue' is a gift because it provides a powerful basis for repeated listening. RTT provides, and provides again, and again. Alaska! sounds like Zeppelin and Unwound fallen down a well, injured and starved, writing music to save their lives."
3,a little underwhelmed,i compared this camera on auto with my ux5 shooting the same sunlite scene and to my surprise the consumer grade camera had a brighter picture. in low light the fx7 was dazzeling. but for the difference in price(5 times higher) i send it back to amazon for refund really really surprised amazon service superb
4,Initially pleased,"I've had the camera for about a month now. Very pleased with the picture quality, the ease of use and durability. I guess time will tell if it was worth the money, but so far I'm happy."
2,I FELT CHEATED,"I assumed since this book cost over $10 that it would be at least normal sized. It was actually less than 200 pages, there was hardly any character development, and the whole book only took me 2 hours to read. I really should have looked at the book stats. It hardly rated paperback status. It looked more like a book my mom made with a desk top publishing program. Take my advice and try to get the book from a library or from a used book store. The story itself was ok, but certainly not worth what I paid for it. I feel as cheated as I did when I bought Micah."
3,2.5 Stars for interesting story concept...,I just recently bought The Watcher Series and The Society Series. And they all kinda ran and blurred into the same story just with different characters. The only thing I did like was the concept for the story lines between Dante and Theo. I don't know if I would recommend this book or series to someone else. This was a classic example of a great story line and poor execution.
3,Dark Watcher,"This story sounded very interesting, unfortunately it was just a wee bit slow at the start, understanding relationships was also difficult to start with and any love scenes - forget about it. Except for the slow start it was a decent read if there was no other more interesting books around"
5,Enchanting and captivating,"A wonderful ride in the fantasy/romance/adventure genre. This book has something for just about everyone. Dark Watcher brings a new perspective on the ways the magical and mundane worlds co-exist, and I love the way Ms. Saintcrow blends magic and romance into a compelling story."
2,whitewash of the Cuban History process,"I read this and the other volumes and found them lacking in the documentation of the Cuban people. It whitewashes the fact that Cuba was and remains a generally racist country. The book ignores the abuses by the Spanish and eventually the Spanish-bred white citizens upon the native and black population.This book and many others turn a blind eye to documenting a people's struggles. While one may encounter many Cubans who would affirm that racism did not exist, the fact remains that racism was an integral fabric of the history of Cuba. Many historical events were shaped by this, and authors (especially predominantly white ones) prefer to ignore this and fail to mention it. History is made up of many white lies, and this book is no exception."
3,part 2 or sequel,so far it's good but i was expecting for more because i have already read a lot about hildegard. can there be a part 2?
3,the life of Hildegard Von Bingen,There is so much that was amazing about the life of Hildegard Von Bingen. It was a great shame this film did not emphasis more of her discoveries.This film was well made in its historical context but greatly lacking in the showing the mystical insights of this great saint. Sadly my friends fell asleep during this dvd and i can not say i blame them. the producers needed to put more joy and entertainment into the script. It was a fairly heavy film that did not excite the viewer into the wonder of this great saint.
2,A movie with a modernist Church theme and behaviour,"This movie was produced in 1983 with modernist themes like the nuns kissing the priests. This does not show how religious in Hildegard' days behaved. Moreover, the altar on which the priests offered Holy Mass looked like the common plainNovus Ordo"" Mass ""table."
1,Better title: I want to quit programming for stand-up comedy,"... or possibly ""to be a dj at a rock-n-roll radio station.""If you're a beginner, you'll be confused by the casual explanations, fuzzy definitions, unclear intent, not to mention language that is intended for pre-schoolers, not adults. And you'll relish spending just as much time debugging the examples and test-cases as you will building and understanding them. I suppose that's also a way to learn. Save your time and spend your money on a better book. I truly believe Amazon should create a five-negative-stars rating for this one."
3,"a decent beginner book, but not a complete reference","This book is a good place to start with Visual Basic programming, but it is NOT a Visual Basic language reference. Consequently, after getting started with VB programming using this book, I found myself just two weeks later in the market for a language reference that I can use to explore the syntax obscurities of the language. Although the book lives up to its title, BEGINNING VB6, it will not be the only text you need on the subject."
4,"Overall an excellent book, but there is one main criticism","I am a struggling computer science student who needed some serious help with vb programming. I found the book provided clear explanations with relevant examples. However I struggled with the exercises at the end of the chapters, not through a lack of understanding, but due to the fact that your exercises required the use of predefined functions which had not already been covered in the book. Despite this problem I did learn a lot more about vb."
3,Nice beginner text but very poor on advanced topics,"This is probably the best book to start with for a complete newcomer to VB or programming. I've been using the previous version of this book to teach beginner-VB classes for the last year and intend to use this one.However, the coverage of advanced topics ranges from sketchy to terrible and a number of language features are ignored completely. You definitely need to pick up a more serious VB book after reading this one (VB6 from the ground up by Gary Cornell is the one I'd recommend) and if you're a programmer, skip this one entirely."
1,"Poor Syntax examples, Jumps subjects","We are present computer programmer students using this book. It is hard to follow and there is not enough information on data manipulation, and where to put the code. Syntax examples are lacking, unclear as to where modules belong, poor explanations."
2,too much hype,"The first few chapters made me think this was a great book. I even enthusiastically recommended it to friends. However, by the time I got to Chapter 9 I was pretty disappointed. It becomes an exercise in copying the code without any good explanation. I'm now reading Gary Cornell's VB6 from the Ground Up (recommended in one of the previous reviews) which is far superior. I can't understand all the praise heaped on this book."
3,Decent book,"The Amazon review up top says that this is a good book if you have no VB experience. I think it would be better to say that this is a good book if you have no programming experience whatsoever. If you have any idea of what OOP is all about then you will probably find the first 5 chapters of this 18 chapter book to be extremely remedial. Take the book title to heart. When they say ""Beginning VB6"" they mean lowest common denominator beginning. Take my advice: If you know basic programming principles and you have some experiece coding (even if its just JavaScript) then go for something more advanced.In all fairness I should point out that I'm only half-way through the book."
4,Good book! Worth to invest,"I have 5 VB book and this is the best. Peter has make the book interesting enough. It is like a real person present the live material to you instead of word. However, type error is one of the concern. e.g P.135 and 136. Should the Ucase has $ at the end? one say yes and the other page is no. I try to download the code from http://www.wrox.com 9:30pm today from the web but it seems the sever doesn't work. Hopefully, the server back online again so I can get the code."
4,Visual Basic 6 Manual Review,"Beginning Visual Basic 6, I find it very well laid out, it offers me valuable information pertaining to programming code, some areas regarding database programming is still a little tough for me to handle right now, but I'm sure reading Beginning Visual Basic 6 is bound to help. Since my software did not come with paper manuals I rely solely and heavily on this manual. Of all the manuals I reviewed in the bookstore, I chose Visual Basic 6 as I felt it was the best."
4,An excellent intro to VB6,"I read this book about 2 years ago to teach myself VB6. A friend of mine recently asked me to recommend a book for him to learn basic object-oriented programming on windows and this book is the only one I can think of. The book is very clearly written as is any programming book published by Wrox. Nowadays, VB.net is much more popular. I guess if you want to learn VB, buy a book on VB.net instead."
1,"If you've never progammed before, this book may help","otherwise, you need another book. I am extremely disapointed in this book, especially the TERRIBLE index. I need a book I can not only read, but also reference when I am coding and asking myself the ""Can I...?"" questions. Please, do yourself a favor, and buy something else."
2,Just do as I say.,"I have made it to chapter 8 and have given up on this book. Each chapter has the same form: Overview, sample program(s), closing. The sample programs only tell you to 'type this exactly as I have and dont worry about what it does.' On the chance that the book tells you what the command does, it wont tell you much. There is no index of the commands with useage."
1,Covers Everything But Coding,"I am a beginner to Visual Basic. I have some previous C++ experience. So far I've finished 14 out of 18 chapters. I've learned about adding control buttons, database access, menus, etc. It's all very top-level about creating a graphical user interface. There's very little about the actual coding itself and the coding syntax. The basics are missing. For example, I went to another book to find out how to read in a file, which Peter Wright does not cover. Also, there are many errors in the book. I'm not very impressed."
3,Unorganized content but some good information,"Just learning VB, this book was recommended to me from someone who I believe is a total idiot. I should have trusted my instinct. There is good information in the book and can help you get into VB, but it is very unorganized! It's basically a program with ten thousand GOTOs!!! He talks about something then says, ""That's covered 4 chapters later""! Or you will see some syntax and he will not address it for 3 chapters. Chapter 2, page 59, he shows a code window with 'Option Explicit' on the top. I kept wondering, what is that and why is that not in my code window? Well, he does not answer that question until Chapter 5!! I sure hope his programs are organized better than this book."
3,Thorough but laborious,"My model for a really thorough and clear presentation of a programming language and how to use it is Kernighan and Ritchie, The C Programming Language. Its clear, its terse, and yet its complete, even for beginners. This book by comparison is long, unfocussed, and laborious; the real-life metaphors for the programming process are unclear and sometimes misleading. The sort of block-diagram in chapter 4 illustrating the procedure for making coffee (I have the french edition, I assume the original is the same except for the language) is a joke. Finally, the exercises provide instant gratification, but are in no way challenging or open-ended. Except for its inordinate length, a beginner who buys this book will be able to get through it, and will have learnt the basics of VB6, but he'll have to buy another book to learn how to apply it in a real development project."
2,Not worth the money. Buy Gary Cornell's instead and save!,"Too much blas and the treatment of topics is in general very shallow. For a better yet cheaper book, try Visual Basic 6 From the Ground Up from Osborne."
3,Good Reference,This was a good reference book. Especially for the money. I find it helpful to have 2-3 ref. books per language for review in case I need them. Amazon does an awesome job supplying thses type of books at a low price.
3,Beginner's Delight -.-.-.-.-.-.- Experience'd Fright,I picked up this book after reading the one of the great books published by Wrox (Beginning Visual C++) and so forgive me if I bend towards comparison .... Well the title says it all ... this book is meant for a complete novice to computers ..... I wouldn't recommend it to a someone who already has some experience in programming .... beginners knock urselves out ... plenty to learn for u guys.... nothing more to stay ... Titles can be so misleading ... Beginning Visual C++ was so great and I learned so much from it so thats why I picked up this book but I am dissappointed.....
3,You can do better.,"There are so many loose ends... I think I would have to lay blame on the editor rather than the author. Was this book rushed off the presses? It may work better in a classroom setting, rather than relying on it alone to get you through the woods as a beginning programmer.If you want a good book for nonprogrammers try ""Learn to Program with Visual Basic 6"" by John Smiley. Unfortunately, I bought this one first."
2,OKAY only for beginners!,"If you already have some experience in programming, I'd suggest you get a book that covers VB topics in a little more detail, rather than one that just tells you how to open a window,drop a control on the form and set properties in a space of five to ten pages - you get the idea, coz thats exactly what the book does all through.Agreed that this is supposed to be a book for beginners but hey, anyone who has even a little bit of programming experience and possesses the intelligence of even a high school kid, does not need to be told things that are so obvious.However for complete novices, who have no programming experience at all, this book may be of good use. All in all this is good buy for those who don't have any experience in programming at all."
2,There's not much here,"Ivor Horton's book on C++ is great. Peter Wright's book on Visual Basic 6 is a joke. He skims over the material in a laughable fashion, not even providing a single code example for some topics. How you can write a book on a programming language and not provide a code example for using mulitdimensional arrays is just plain BAD. Then on numerous occassions the author blows the subject off by saying, ""That's all there is to it, so I'm not going to dwell on it anymore."" The truth is that there is a lot more to a concept like arrays for example than the skimpy coverage he provides. Books like this just want to make me write my own that much more."
2,Very bad approach,"Anyone can write a book which can explain the basics of VB environment. But it takes a great teacher to explain the more involved concepts like Object oriented approach. here is where Peter wright is lacking. He seem to introduce examples with components in them which are explained in the later chapters. The text lacks coherence and seem to jump from one topic to another. also the phase and flow of the topics is uneven. for example, he seems to introduce too much at once.As a whole I found the book to be not very good."
5,Loads of Information,This is the perfect book for the beginner to intermediate VB programmer. The author touches many subjects with just the right amount of detail. A great book to get you hooked to Visual Basic programming.
4,"Good for Beginners, very thorough simple discussions","Beginning Visual Basic 6 is just that, a book for Beginners. With zero programming experience you can delve right into meddling with complex GUI interfaces that will astonish any hard-core unix programmer. Of course, he doesn't go into detailed analysis of every bitty control, and that is explained in the intro. My only quip with this one is that, as with most beginners books, there is too much unnecessary hand-holding. At times, the steps of operating VB6 are more in-depth than the actual programming; which means it will prolly be a longer read than you're expecting with slower results. But the lessons are quite effective at introducing us newbies to the VB6 interface...preparing us to delve into the sticky MSDN help files for VB6. A very nice read, I recommend it."
3,Had the book for a class text,The book is fairly easy reading and reads fast. Some of the examples however are alittle vague and particularly in chapter 8 the homework is hopeless. It could have been alot simplier for a beginner. I think alittle of the author's ego in his ability to program got in the way of a beginner's view of programming
5,Great narration captures attention.,"I seldom listen to audio books because they're usually abridged causing the story to be choppy and narrations are often dull. But this one is delightful mostly due to the narration/performance of Theresa Saldana. Her caustic Brooklyn accent brings the character of Tina to life and lets the reader feel he is actually sitting next to the confused and rather foul mouthed Tina.At the age of 30, working girl Tina becomes pregnant by Vini, the lovable but unsophisticated plumber. Tina makes decisions about her life that are frustrating and confusing - rejecting Vini, involving herself with a married man - to her friends, especially her best friend Angie, but they are always there to help.I recommend the book to readers who enjoy a good yarn about friendship and the burdens of life's choices, or if you just want to hear a superb audio performance."
2,Died After Four Months,"My battery brain worked as advertised until it died for no reason four months later. The only reason I gave two stars instead of one is that it does work . . . until it stops working. Based on some other reviews I have read, it seems that I am not the only victim. I would stay away until they change the design and solve whatever is making these things fail."
1,Buyer Beware,"Put this on my 2006 Corvette because it sits a lot and after a couple of weeks the battery could go dead. Used it for about a week and then finally took it off. Started actively driving the car again (with a new battery) I'd park the car, go back to start it 10 minutes later and it would have disconnected my battery for no reason. Was random. May work on some cars but is probably pure luck at what their trigger threshold is. Would not recommend."
3,Battery Brain performance,"I have had a Battery Brain on each of my '55 cars (Olds and Pontiac)for several years and they continue to work fine, although the cars don't get driven much. I installed one on my wife's '99 Cadillac Catera because of a phantom electrical problem that drains the battery every now and then for no apparent reason. Problem solved. Until recently, after the unit had been in use for about a year. Now it beeps - one for unlock, two for lock - but no 'click.' The unit is no longer doing what it is supposed to do. I called SMGY but their phone apparently has been disconnected. My e-mails go un-answered. Are they still in business?"
2,It's true. remote reset stopped working after third time.,"Except for remote reset failing after third cycle, this product works as claimed. Included is perhaps everything needed to allow any installation imaginable."
1,"good idea, poor execution","I purchased 2 of these fans a year ago and installed one immediately and the other more recently. Within 6 months of operation the first became increasingly noisy and required frequent application of a silicone lubricant to cut down on the constant squeaking. When I installed the second one I noticed how much more powerful it was even though they're the exact same model, same southern exposure installation, same proximity to vent source. I thought maybe the first had a defect in the motor given noise & power difference so contacted Attic Aire's customer service (merchant I purchased from no longer carries their products). Long story short I was told I must be mistaken or not installed it per manufacturer instructions and that if I didn't believe their form responses to inquiries that was just too bad. While the idea is good, as we all know poor customer support can kill a product."
5,Very fun game,"The best way I can describe this game is 'competition group solitaire'. It is so much fun! Adults and children alike can play this and enjoy it, which makes it a wonderful family game."
4,My teenage girl likes this game more than Hawaii!,It's not just a speed game. You have to be fast and constantly thinking FAST! A good game to play with anyone. Tons of laughter. A great way to connect with people. We played this game in Maui and saw our girl smile and laugh more than any other activity in Maui!
3,Complicated game,"I liked playing this game, but can't get anyone to play with me. The rules were long and complicated and it did take quite a bit of concentration to play. Not a lot of chit chatting, so definitely not a good party game!"
5,Fun!,"Very fast paced, entertaining game. You can play with 2 or more. This was a gift and very well received."
5,Very good game,"My family used to play this game all the time. It's a fast paced, everyone play at the same time game. You have a pile that is your goal to get rid of, and then there are the play piles in front which is what you get points on. It can only play 2, 3 or 4 people, with the most chaotic fun being 4 people.I rated medium for educational and durable because there really isn't much education other than recognizing patterns (for working piles it goes either by colors or by ""boy, girl"" which makes sense when you see the cards) and durable because it is a card game. They're just normal cards so with the excitement and frenzy the cards can get bent up. Also, my family played it so much that the cards would get bent up from shuffling so much!Overall though I do highly recommend this game."
3,Husker Blitzer,Dutch blitz is fun to play if you have 3-4 players. Shuffling speed and luck are the main factors in winning.
5,Fast-Paced Fun,I would describe this game as Speed Solitaire for multiple players. I bought a copy for my mother and for myself and have enjoyed playing it during family parties.
5,Fun and multi-generational,"I first played Dutch Blitz at a women's retreat years ago. As a result, I bought the game to play with my kids, ages 7 through high school. It is a fast game that requires a little strategy and a little speed, but can be as intense (or not) as you want it to be. It's fun and comfortable to play for adults and kids. I took it on a vacation to the beach one year, and when my daughter got too sunburned to go outside one day, we played it all day and never tired of it. Now that's a fun game. (And I'm not what you'd call a ""game person."""
2,Card game,No one liked it. Can't say any more about it since it was only used once or twice in two years.
5,Great family game,Dutch Blitz is a very fast paced 2 to 4 player game. It's similiar to solitaire. My family and friends all enjoy this game.
5,Lots of fun for an old classic,"This is a great family game, it's easy to learn and fun for many ages...the only con I can think of is that you can only have four people play at once. If they added a few more colors, it could be a good group game as well."
5,"Fun for the whole family, and your intoxicated friends!","The rules of this game are fairly simple and easy to understand, making it playable for even the youngest crowd. Through the interaction of several players, the simple rules result in a fast paced, exciting and challenging gameplay. Traditionally teams can be formed to allow specialization of individual tasks, thereby accelerating the pace of the game even further. So it's good for family ( if kids are too young they can be paired with someone else, and their roll in the game can be simplified to keep them competitive ), and it's good for adults ( the level of difficulty can be exponentially increased through various levels of inebriation at parties and such for higher entertainment value ).All and all it's a very dynamic and exciting game. It'll get your heart pounding for sure."
2,Not worth the money,This game has been redone many times. I was hoping for something new or original. It's not. It's just a repackaging of a card game you can play with regular face cards.
2,Ghosts in my TV. Boo!,"This tv has the nice ""feature"" of turning on randomly at all time of the day. It's really fun when it's 3am and the tv decides to turn on and scare the Jebus out of me and my wife. We've resorted to unplugging it every night. Quite inconvenient if you ask me. Also, there are two discolored spots due to badly shielded speaker magnets. Suggestion... buy a different brand of television."
2,Good Picture & Sound as long as it works,"First I had 32"" version of this TV (almost everthing same with features / design etc), that TV had few issues like the picture flickers on few channels snd sometimes the pictures becomes so dark you dont know what is happening on the scene.I relocated and I had to buy a new TV here. Comprising on cost, I went in for this 27"" Philips TV which offers (atleast lists many features) many features. Finally I find that the TV turns itself on its OWN on DAY 1. Thinking about returning the item."
5,Awesome book!,It's great to see young voters being able to express their opinions in this type of forum. Great book!
4,Bless the Publishers,"The fact that this gigantic project made it onto the bookshelves at last is testament to Rob and Dean, and all who helped them at College Tree Publishing. Praise to these two men.Oh, and by the way. To all the ""Bush-bashers"" in this book.""DUBYA"" stands for *W*inner.53 million strong my friends."
1,Whitewash by the Establishment,"Hey folks. this sad, ignorant show is what happens when you get a highly paid talking head who does no research of his own, beamed into your living room. If you want to keep your head in the sand (or worse places) about UFO's and the Shadow Gov't coverup for 60+ years, then buy this and tell your friends. If you want the real gold, read ""Exempt From Disclosure"", any books by Timothy Goode, Dr. Steve Greer, Frank Edwards, Maj Donald Keyhoe, Richard Dolan. The ET's have been here for maybe 25,000 years, keeping us from destroying each other and Earth. Pass on Peter ""Give me another cigarette"" Jennings. I hope he's had a change of mind since he's on the Other Side. AMFAA"
3,Not a finished product,"After a delay in shipping, which the seller was responsive and apologetic about, I finally received this table to find out the peices don't really fit together very well. It was as if the holes to insert things should have been further apart. I had to hammer them in quite hard, and it's still not level, i.e. the table legs hit the floor at an angel. I sure won't be putting anything heavy on it. Also, one of the legs was split slightly, which was clearly worsened when i had to hammer it in. Last, I love natural wood, but this is so natural it's naked. No finish, and it's not clean cut- you can pull wood shaving/strings off (sorry, wish I could be more technical but I have no idea what those would be called). I'll finish it, and may even paint it. All in all, I don't think it was false advertising, I just think you will pay for something you need to do a lot of work to."
5,Extremely readable and very informative,"The layout of the text lends itself to easy-to-understand readability. The content is well-worth twice the cost, since so many topics are explained easily and fully for the novice as well as the well-versed personal investor."
1,Off the wall and biased,The author seems to enjoy saying contrary things - like don't buy muni bonds for the tax benefit - which just don't make sense. The investment section of the book are superficial and confusing which made sense when I saw that the author solicits money to manage.This book is also not organized is a WAY TOO long.
1,Sarcastic and self promoting,"A little good information lost is a sea of self promotion.Save your money and look at the clean, less dogmatic books put out by the Wall Street Journal.Mr. Edelman's style is to make you feel stupid for being human, but then try to sweet talk you into buying his other books (which have pretty much the same information in them).Also, question any book written by someone who makes his living earning commissions selling insurance and invesment funds - how unbiased can he be?"
1,not enough red hot chili peppers,"This dvd sucks!!! It nothing but a montage of pics (the same pics) repeated over & over; set to music (Which aren't even Chili Peppers songs) Followed by interviews with everybody but the RHCP. The interviews are good but they're are much better dvds out there(Off the Map, Funky Monks & Red Hot Chili Peppers - Live at Slane Castle) Save your money and buy one of them. Live at Slane Castle has the best concert footage. Also check out Greatest Hits and Videos -Red Hot Chili Peppers, It has videos plus extra behind the scenes."
3,"BUBBLE BUBBLE, GUM AND FUN!","Popular music would have been so much poorer without the occasional bubblegum hit! I cannot imagine a childhood devoid of the fluffy pop of The Archies' Sugar Sugar! It appears on this album in no less than three versions, two of them being 99 remixes. The other tracks are of the same ilk, sweet nonsense songs about those things that matter when you're a teenager, with a very innocent 60s flavour. I remember another Archies hit from 1971 that's omitted here, though - A Summer Prayer For Peace. It was a bit more serous than any of the candyfloss here. But get this if you want to relive your youth!"
5,A country album that is actually country!,How refreshing it is to listen to a country album that actually has country songs on it! Good ones at that. 'Nuff said.
3,Its OK but...,I found this CD to be quickly forgettable. Only a few of the songs stuck with me. At one point I had to stop it because one song is just purely monoemotional. No rise or fall in the pitch of her voice. Listen to as much as you can before you buy. I believe certain people will love it while others will be completely dissatisfied.
5,a great cd,I found this cd even better than the first. Her voice and range are exceptional. Too bad she won't get any air time on radio for her voice to be heard by all. Don't miss this one. A real talent.
5,"an unique and ""delicious"" accent","Here in Brazil, we love our country music and, for sure, the american country music, too !! CMT is the responsible for that great divulgation ... and was where i saw Allison Moorer for the first time !! She is really a ""breathtaking"" singer ... her voice is sweet ... remarkable ... and she has a ""delicious"" accent !! Words like ... ""flowers"" ... ""dark"" ... ""teeth"" ... ""candy"" ... sounds joyfully from her lips !! I've heard and heard ... several times the ""The Hardest Part"" and, each time, i have discovered a new detail ... a new reason to love her music even more ... and love her angel's face ... ""Taste"" her songs ... you will not regret, indeed !!!! She is fantastic !!!"
5,Another Good Read,"I am so happy that the Destoyer is in capable hands. The last few books have been very enjoyable to read. The action is great, the inter-paly between Remo and Chiun has been excellent. I would recommend this book to all Destroyer fans."
3,Good for Catholic Babies,"My son liked this more when he was younger, he is 15 months now and he loses interest half way through. Also, I saw this on EWTN the other day and wish I could have just DVR'd it instead. It is a good alternative to Baby Einstein, though, and great for babies under one. I bought Part Two recently, and that is one of his favorite DVDs. I recommend that one more for an older baby."
1,Worst Book ever,"This book had no secure plot, on and off characters and really just had no point at all. It was literally killing me while I read this dreadful book.I RECOMEND THAT TOU DON'T READ THIS BOOK. BELIEVE ME. THE ONLY THING THAT GOT THE 1 START WAS THE HAVE DECENT PICTURE ON THE FRONT COVER."
5,Great Product,I think all enthusiasts of Grant Green should be grateful to Wolf Marshall for this product. GG's technique and musicality deserve great study and admiration. Thanks to Wolf Marshall's guide more and more people will be able to give it just that. The transcriptions are faultlessly accurate and the choice of tracks is excellent.
2,"I dun'no, this just wasn't really what I though is was going to be.","Largely Wolf's work - Its difficult to feel the Green in this. I'm 1) not sure it captures the notions of Grant, & 2) I believed this was going to be a more technical discussion - dimensionally.Excerpts don't reflect renditions of the same title from artists that Wolf names in the individual title discussion.Apparently superfluous info rather that expectation setting or guides for further development."
2,Best of Grant Green,"Although this book covers quite a few of Grant Green's work, It primarily only covers the solos. Instead the chords are only listed and not charted. From my experience there are several chord voicings to choose from and it takes a lot of time to look at the solos and find the correct voicings. I have purchased Hal leonard products in the past and they were much more comprehensive.This is a good book if you just want a little insight into Grants Greens music. But an authentic recorded version of some of his better works would be much better."
5,The One and Only GRANT GREEN!!!,I've been searching for this book so long. Thank you Amazon for having it and for delivering it so in time. I've been checking it and it's very accurate. Thanks again!
4,THE BIRDS,THIS BOOK WAS PRETTY GOOD AND HAD A GREAT DEAL OF DETAIL! I WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR ANYONE!
3,meat fork,i think this fork could have been made better. it drops the meat before i'm able to get it flipped. i find myself using the tongs more often. You can't beat the price though but i'd pay more to get something that will actually hold the meat. it's well made though just not at the ends where it counts.
3,Extremely challenging project.,"I bought this book used as I wanted to make a rocking horse for my granddaughter. It proved to be one of the most challenging projects I have ever completed. Wood carving, carpentry, metal working, and leather working skills are required for this endeavor. All of the hardware and tack is unavailable here in USA and as such, I had to make everything. The patterns and general instructions are OK, but much specific detail is left to the craftsman. Do not expect a ""Rocking Horses for Dummies"" book. You need to have a lot of skills and patience for this project. After 100 hours of trial and error, mine came out fine. See the photo posted on the product listing."
5,I haven't put the book away,"I want to tell you how very much I love your ""Poetry for a Lifetime"". I grew up memorizing (or trying to) so many of these poems. Even now I remember a lot of first stanzas and last lines so I was happy to renew the in-between lines. Believe me, I haven't put your book on the bookshelf-I enjoy it too much."
3,"Old Favorites, not very adventurous","My grandmother wanted a book of ""old favorites"" and I gave her this. She loves it because it contains the poems she read when she was in school. The material is not very challenging, however; not everyone will even consider much of the content poetry at all (e.g. nursery rhymes, certain patriotic songs). So it is recommended for someone who wants a collection of familiar poems, but not recommended for someone who knows poetry well or is looking to expand his/her knowledge of poetry."
2,"Nicely bound, but mostly mediocre poems","A nice book (binding, print), but contains a selection of mostly mediocre poems; It is fun to leaf though any collection of poems, and there are a number of favorites by Keats, Longfellow and Tennyson, however, the majority of the poems are by unknown poets, selected for subjects that fit into the categories into which the book is organized (youth, friendship, etc.). If I had seen the book before I bought it, I would have opted instead for one with a better collection."
3,Apealing to the older reader....,"Poetry for a Lifetime seems to aim at people over 50 and for those who enjoy sappy sayings. There are many classics, but there aren't as many as i hoped there would be. A great disapointment I had, was that the authors' names weren't listed in the contents; only poem titles. If you find you favorite poems by looking up relyable names like me, Poetry for a Lifetime won't help you there."
1,Life isn't grand...,"and neither is this album. I listened to it once last year. The fact I haven't bothered to listen again should tell you what I think of it.Axl Rose was the true star of Guns N' Roses. Take away Axl and you've just have a Slash who's a good guitarist. There is one and only Axl Rose, guys who know how to play guitar well are a dime a dozen (which might be a proper price for this album)."
4,Wailing Guitar - Gotta Love It,"Wow - so Im a couple of years late picking up this CD - and I gotta say I owe it ro becoming a hard core Ryan Roxie fan from him playing with Alice Cooper and Dads Porno Mag. I initialy picked this CD up just to listen to Roxie on the guitars and expected nothing special and then - BAM - this CD rocks! Been there Lately, Shine, Speed Parade, Serial Killer - they are all kick ass rock tracks. Sure - there is nothing ""new"" here, but they arent pretending there is. Rod Jackson's voice is perfectly suited for this kinda stuff, and well - Slash and Roxie are just awesome axe men!!If you're looking for a straight out Rock and Roll album to jump around playing air guitar to - get this- give it a listen or two and rip out your leather pants!"
5,A Great CD,"This is the first CD I have purchased out of hundreds which has compelled me to write one of these things, mostly because I almost passed this CD by assuming what it would be like before hearing it. Generally, like the others I think this is a solid and very worthwhile purchase. However, it is worth pointing out that Ain't Life Grand is probably quite different than what you would expect beginning to end. First off, the vocalist is just raw and really ""on"". If you like Corey Glover/Living Color vocals just click buy now. Secondly, many of the songs are quite polished and produced, more so than you would expect -- Great combination of just plain GNR style jam combined with real thought behind making a good variety of music which does not blur together and sound the same from beginning to end. GNR meets Living Color, with some of the best guitar you've heard in a while Guaranteed. A must buy for the real rock fan in a time when a good rock CD's are being released more and more seldomly."
2,Ain't G'NR Memories Grand . . .,"I am a Slash fan. The guy has his own style and can play.But alas, listening to this album was like watching a movie sequel: predictable, a few thrills, but not as good as the original. Guns 'N Roses ruled. This stuff feels like a great guitar player with an average band playing to the past instead of seizing the future.There are exceptions. I think ""Back to the Moment"" and the title track sound like they were written after 1993 and rock, standing brow-to-brow with strong G'NR material. But there's no ""Rocket Queen"" or ""Coma"" or ""You Could Be Mine"" here. Most of the riffs feel like outtakes from the Use Your Illusion sessions, with flashes of mellow or fiery brilliance in the middle or at the end of a few tunes.If Slash had released this four years ago, I would've thought, ""Well, this isn't his best, but has its moments, cool, the band just broke up, and his next album, next year, will be astonishing."" But I waited five years between albums for this? ...."
5,Best Slash Since GNR!,"I picked up this CD the day it came out, and after a few listens, I'm glad to say I made a great buy. This CD is hard and fast, almost metal, as heard on speed parade and landslide. It also has a taste of blues and loads of good ol' rock. Serial Killer (written as Serial above) is a beautiful and creepy song, with the children singing some of the lyrics. If you love GNR, or It's Five O'Clock Somewhere, you can't go wrong w/ this CD!"
3,Going through the motions,"I expected something a little more innovative from Slash. Nothing on this CD comes close to GNR, really quite boring and forgettable, unfortunatly."
4,Grab A Les Paul And Lets Rock.,"I love this mans style, his attitude and most of all his guitar playing and music. He makes brilliant music with a truly beautiful instrument, a proper rock n roll star. In my opinion Slash is God of the guitar and yet again has produced a good time rock n roll record. The album is full of cool guitar riffs, listen to every track because it shows Slash can still rock and it justs out lines the pure talent of the man. My only complaint is Slash don't leave it so long between albums, I've waited five long years for this, but it has proved to be well worth the wait.If you apperciate good rock n roll you will love this album, so pour yourself another JD and Coke, sit back and enjoy, I know you will."
4,"Great Game, Super Strategy Guide","Great Game, Super Strategy GuideThe strategies introduced here will enable the new player to survive long enough to really enjoy the game. I might add one strategic suggestion: Use the ships that can capture enemy ships to capture enemy miners for your own use. You slow down there production while increasing your resource and production much more quickly."
3,O.K. for the price,"This book is just O.K. for the price. You can get it cheap, but most of the information can be found on websites by now. Still Homeworld is a great game and there is more in this book on multi-player stratigies."
3,Not the original album,"Fans should be aware that this is *not* the original Mercury label album, ""Thank God For The Radio,"" from 1986. This is a ""best-of"" sampler, with only eight songs, and a different track listing. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Guide To Country Music)"
4,"brilliant yet, occasionally, tedious","The beauty of this book is that it uses account books and letters to put together avery detailed account of the life of an Italian noble churchman who aspired to be(and near the end of the book becomes) a cardinal. And he's no ordinary cardinal --he's a favorite of Francois I of France, a patron of Cellini, and the like.The downside of the book is that every so often you feel as if you're reading anannotated Visa bill. Long discussions of how much money was paid for differentitems, where the best items came from, etc. Not everything is likely to be interesting.In my case I enjoyed details of how clothing was made (and discovering that furswere often recycled from one piece to another) but was bored by long discussion offees to bargemen and carters for hauling produce."
5,Got surround ? Crank it up !,"Unbelievable DVD about Ferrari's that made racing history, no music, just engine. Sit back crank up the surround sound and let yourself be taken for an amazing hair raising ride. If you sit close enough to the TV you would think your sitting in the cars. The camera angles where fantastic as well as Alain's commentaries. This DVD is about racecars from the start of Ferrari to mid 70's. Great addition to any DVD car collection."
2,What driving???,"I'm watching this video tonite and there's no driving!! A 2 minute spin in a Testarossa??Let's take the Dino for a ride shall we? As he drives the Dino out of the parking lot, this video switches to another car, moving down the road, filmed from a distance. The GTO?? Nope, no driving, just a quick shot of it leaving the lot. Has this version been cut down?? Having paid $30 for it and we're not going anywhere behind the wheel. Then there's the 275 GTB...No driving at all. He leaves the lot, and then we switch to another car. On and on and on.Is this really an un-edited version? It looks to be cut just as Alain is ready to take us on a spin, especially the Dino. The Dino! I am so disappointed."
4,T-Shirt Gift to Family Member,T-Shirt was delivered in a timely manner. Person receiving this shirt as a gift was very pleased since they were hard to find in the area where they lived.
3,Fun pop album,"I thought that the Cheetah Girls' new album, TCG is a fun, bouncy pop release. But what stands out is the singing, especially the second half! There are a few numbers that recall '80s pop, though not too derivative or retro. The three JR Rotem produced songs solidify the huge impact he's made on urban music the past 12 months. I've heard about 20 different songs he's done for artists, and the Cheetah Girls' efforts step them up a notch from their early Disney songs. One reason I give the album only 3 stars is that they try a little too hard to sound like Destiny's Child on 2-3 dance numbers. They sound a little bit like DC's hits Survivor or Lose My Breath. And I'm in my 30s and love this effort. They will really expand their audience with this release."
1,NO...This Isn't Great At All!,"The Cheetah Girls are...ok. I love the movies, and the first and second soundtracks to their movies are really good.But, with their studio debut album, TCG, the spark isn't their. The only songs on the album that are good, are ""All In Me,"" and ""Homesick.""I'm glad Raven left the group, because he 2008 self-titled album was way better than this album.Also, I could really care regardless whether people disagree with me."
2,Yoknapatawpha's worst,"The two stars is just for his brilliant language and incredible games with words. If you're going to read ""Flags,"" please do wait until you've already read ""The Sound and The Fury,"" ""Absalom Absalom,"" ""Sanctuary,"" and some of his other stars, but don't read this one first. You'll miss out on the beauty of his other works because you won't want to read him again. The sentences go on for days and are just incredibly rambling, even for Faulkner. The story doesn't live up to many of his other ones. One of the aspects of the plot is, is that southern male is troubled somewhat by his sister's sexuality. That usually juices up the rest of Faulkner but it's just kind of voyeuristic, gross and boring here. The copy I read had wisteria on the cover, and that is what this book reminds me of....faded wisteria, with a lingering sticky-sweet smell, but having lost its vibrant color and its potency."
3,I can see why it was heavily edited,"Sometimes it was hard to keep reading even though I love this author.It was still far from bad. Though I will warn those who know nothing about Faulkner, it is not a warm fuzzy story."
4,bratz,My daughters really like the magic carpet. They like the whole genie line of Bratz. It seems pretty well made.
4,Kinda OK.,"in the information box, it says that the carpet ""Really sways forward, backward and side to side!"" yeah, IF YOU MOVE THE CARPET LIKE THAT WITH YOUR HAND!!!!!!!!! overall, it was kinda a disapointment. but i was still kinda happy that i got it. of course, it IS sitting in the back of my closet, and i almost NEVER use it, but whenever i want to watch the movie, i get it out...sometimes...but, that's just what i think of it! if you daughter(or yourself) has a GREAT imaganation, then they'll love this toy!End the war between Bratz and Barbies/myscenes,(FYI, some people like to play with one, some the other! it doesn't matter that much!!)Peace Maker,Erika"
1,Third Day of Christmas review,"For the third day of christmas I'm going to review...The Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout. The game is at least playable but has no appeal. Making a brithday-themed game is one of the worst ideas ever with a big name like Bugs Bunny. The plot is third-rate. Everytime you get hit you see stars and you can't use your hammer awhile. All the bosses are no-brainers like Daffy Duck. All you have to do is get the carrot. No fighting him at all. The side villians are weird. I mean walking boxes with the letter S on them,little hammerhead guys,guys in trash cans,the flying fireballs but worst of all,the walking clocks becuase they're everywhere,you can't hit them without hurting yourself and when you kill them they explode like forever and you have to stand back. Even after you kill it,another one comes right away. It's also WAY too generous with the extra lifes. The ending is gargabe. Overall,NEVER BUY THIS GAME EVER! I give this game a 1 out of 10."
3,"GOD IS REAL, JESUS WAS THE MOST POWERFUL MESSANGER","MY Father was born in Scotland in 1930.as he grew up, the old folk, grandmothers etc,.They would die of old age, or a cold or etc...There was not one cancer, altzheimrers was no existent,dementia was non existent.MOST OF THE DISEASES THAT PLAGUE OLDER PEOPLE TODAY,DID NOT EXIST,WHY???BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT BEEN INVENTED YET LIKE AIDS.......AIDS AIRED IN AFRICA, IT WAS NEVER MEANT FOR THE HOMOSEXUAL COMMUNITY,IT WAS TO DESTROY THE BLACK POPULATIONS OF AFRICA ACCORDINGTO THE CLUB OF ROME....."
4,Nice and lightweght,"I use these headphones to watch TV at home while I'm on the treadmill. They're perfect for that use, with an extralong cord, and they're very lightweight."
5,Very good for the money,This attic fan was designed well and was easy to install. Easy to use temperature control. Others costing twice as much do not do any better.
3,Same fan?,"Product came super fast. It has same appearance, generally, but this is a four bladed fan, whereas the discription was for a six bladed fan."
5,Serious Music,The CD is real it is about real life with some slamming beats plus the singer is beautiful with a strong beautiful voice to match. Worth every penny and some.
4,Good Egyptian Arabic micro-course,"A great neat course from the BBC on Arabic. Originally a BBC Radio 4 series, it was originally recorded at broadcast quality (I've not heard the latest recordings, of course). Being designed for radio, you don't strictly need the book, though it helps a lot. It takes you through everyday activities, like ordering food and drink or meeting people. Lots of repetition, not enough to be boring.Only two points. The Arabic here is a strongly Egyptian Arabic, and while that is widely understood elsewhere in the Arab world, it's going to be hard to understand people's reply outside Egypt. And make sure you get the cassettes - the cassettes are more important than the book."
3,Maxi Regular para un album genial,"Canción para amantes del techo-electronico.El maxi esta bien, a destacar el remix ""Piney Girl Mix"" con coros vocales geniales.El video me ha gustado bastante (no es del estilo de Breathe, pero es que a mi me encanta las animaciones).Opté por comprar la edición americana que costaba 3 veces menos que la europea (en europa comercializan 2 maxi y un dvd maxi con casi el mismo contenido que el maxi americano)."
1,First time for everything,"I have purchased several items on Amazon and have been very happy with the results, until now...The product was packaged poorly. The throttle control is so tight that you can only move it if you hold the base down with your other hand and feels like it's about to break off. The product was shipped without the required software.All of these can be fixed with a little know how. But the fact that after repairing the throtle and getting the correct software the computer does not even sense that the controller is plugged in tells me that the shipper either new it was broken or never tested it.I know that it is the item I purchased that is faulty as I have another X45 I was replaceing due to a worn out switch.I recomend looking for a different vendor. This one does not care enough to make sure they are doing right by the consumer."
1,USB Compatible?,"I received my Saitek X45 Joystick & throttle but only the joystick has a USB connection. The throttle has a different connector that will not fit any slot on my computer. I am not sure what type of connector it is because there is absolutely NO statement of any type about this either on the box or in the manual included. In fact I don't think there is any mention of installing the hardware at all (except for saying to install it prior to loading the software).I never used the IL-2 Sturmovic WWII combat simulator software working because it slowed my whole system down. just trying to click on what I wanted to do (mission, etc.) was almost impossible. I had to slightly move my mouse and guess where it would stop (about 3 seconds later) and then click. Finally I just gave up.I am just returning the whole thing."
2,"If it's not metal, it's garbage!","This product is a great starter HOTAS (Hands On Throttle And Stick). But it is a HORRIBLE finisher.The buttons stick. A quick perusal of the usenet will show this to be the norm.The stick has an annoying (and childish) cover over the missile button. This is stupid. The stick is WAY too big as well. I'm all over it trying to get to the different buttons. A REAL fighter joystick has all buttons VERY easy to reach. You can forget about quick response with this thing.The stick's programmability leaves A LOT to be desired. There is no way to program a key to do different keystrokes on subsequent presses. For instance, button 8 could map to ""g"" to lower gear. And then, hitting button 8 again would map to ""U"" to cause gear to retract.The stick's plastic resistance base at the end of the springs also doesn't move smoothly - it's jumpy.My recommendation: Cougar HOTAS from ThrustMaster. I'm E-Bay'ing my Saitek."
5,Can be enjoyable once setup,"I've used the Original Thrustmaster set, Mark II and ACM card, including pedals for years, but, as I upgraded my computer I was unable to keep using them. My Brother first showed me these about two years ago and after a bit of first setup shaky-ness I am very happy with the performance. For the money you cant get much better. Yea, sure pay almost $300.00 for the Thrustmaster Couger set like I did before, but, not till I really have to. OH, as a minor note I don't like the joystick look and the placement of the #2 button is real bad in a dogfight, also, what's the idea of the pinky switch? I have quit programming this button. The throttle on the other hand is, if your really into flight feel's like the F-16's when your wearing flight gloves."
4,Great Value,"I think this controller is an excellent value when compared to the competing Thrustmaster products. I used to own a Thrustmaster F-16 FLCS, and the TQS throttle and Rudder pedals. Programming and calibrating those was always a hassle.The X45 is much easier to program. The build quality of this unit is superior to the older Thrustmaster sticks. I can't compare it to a Cougar, having never used one. But, this stick is far superior to older Thrustmasters (without modifications) for sure. For the money I don't think you can beat it.The only complaint i have is that the throttle control is very stiff. The base isn't quite heavy enough, and it can be a little frustrating. The stiffness probably will work it's way out with some use. Also, you could probably jerry rig some kind of clamp to fix the base to the table. Frankly, I had the same issues with the TQS out of the box, and it worked itself out over time.Overall, at this price it is an excellent value."
3,Ok but metal disk cover,I bought this thinking I was getting a plastic cover instead it was metal cover. Just beware the slide cover is metal not plastic.
4,Floppy Disks,"I use these floppy disks on an older embroidery machine, and it was nice that I could still find them. They were shipped fast!"
1,WHAT A CROCK OF BALOGNA!!!!,"SURE THESE FLOPPY'S ARE INEXPENSIVE...THEY ARRIVED ON TIME...THANKS AMAZON!!!!! BUT THE PHOTO DOESN'T GIVE IT ANY CREDIT...THESE DON'T COME WITH A PLASTIC CARRYING CASE LIKE THE PHOTO...JUST A CRAPPY CARDBOARD BOX! COME ON GUYS....WHERES THE PLASTIC CASE FOR THESE THINGS, NOW THEY WILL BE FLOPPING ALL OVER THE PLACE IN MY DESK DRAWERS ETC!"
4,ericsson standard battery bst-33,"very good product for very low price. it is stgill working, and i hope it will last at least the same length of time with the original."
4,It works!,"I got the delivery so fast. So far it works too! 3 days back up, 2 days with more use. Anyway I recommend this product."
4,Ericsson cell phone battery,"I purchase two Sony Ericsson Standard Batteries BST-33 for my wife cell phone, at a great price, and they charge like a charm. I saved a ton of money, the regular cost for one of these is $35.00 at a brick and mortar store.."
2,No better than original,"This battery must be as old as the original supplied by the OEM. The ""life"" is just as short as the original. This purchase allows me to use one battery as the other is being charged.I have no idea how one obtains a new or improved battery over ordering on-line."
4,Battery,"Finally, after 3 tries a battery for my Z750A Sony Ericcson that lasts more than 24 hours on standby. After about a month of use I'm getting about 5 days on standby. Not as good as my MOTO V3, at 8-10 days, but much improved."
3,Do not expect too much,"I bought this battery for my Sony Ericsson phone. It discharges very quickly, after few hours, but it is better, because my previous one discharged after 1 hour."
3,S.E. Battery,"Great product ,great price all though the phone I,purchase the battery for,no longer works. Don;t get me wrong it was the phone that ,didn't work ,the battery was a great find."
1,order not received and no response,I have not received my order and emailed to check status but no response. Still trying to find out where the order is.
1,Battery made in China--not Japan,"Battery was made in China, not in Japan as shown online. Deal with them at your own risk. Battery was made in China, not in Japan as shown online. Deal with them at your own risk.Battery was made in China, not in Japan as shown online. Deal with them at your own risk."
2,Didn't make my phone work,Bought this new battery because my old one exploded. Inserting and charging the new battery did not help an inch.
1,BST 33 SONY BATTERY,"I DO NOT RECEIVED THE REAL BATTERY MADE IN JAPAN OFFER IN THE WEB PAGE, I PAYD $69.00 US DOLLARS FOR THIS BATTERY AND RECEIVE BY AMAZON A BATTERY MADE IN CHINA, for this price I can to buy 4 or 5 batteries Sony Ericsson made in China."
2,Looked new but discharges faster than the battery i am replacing,Bought this battery for my Sony Ericsson mobile phone. It looked new but it discharges even faster than the one that I am replacing.
1,Didn't work with TM506,"This battery did not work with my Sony Erricson TM506 phone. I even brought it to the cell phone provider and they said the battery was a dud. It did not work with their TM506 in the store either.The seller graciously took it back for a refund, although i may have lost out on the shipping fees."
4,Good Battery life,"Workes fine and battery life is good. I dont see any difference between original battery and this. Good for the money , same cost atleast 3 time more in the store."
4,Replacement Battery,"I purchased this for my wife's phone because her battery would no longer charge. Even though by all accounts this is the correct battery for her SE Z750a cell phone, some of this battery's details didn't exactly match the original. Nevertheless it fits and works as it should."
3,"Usable, but not the standard regular battery.",The battery is usable but does not have the standard life compared to the normal batteries. It is decent but seems to be a knock off brand.
4,"Real rock n' roll, great cd!","This is very rare music by today's standards. Not many bands play such in your face rock. The only commercialy viewable rock bands today are Limp Bizkit and Korn. But New American Shame are different. They don't need to blend rap in their music because they don't need to be popular. All they care about is pissed off, in your face ROCK! It's not a perfect cd, some songs fall a bit flat, and the dude's voice can get a tad annoying sometimes, but the guitar is excellent, it reminds me of old school Motley Crue. These guys know how to write some good songs. Under It All, Broken Bones, Down in the Valley and American Shame among others. These guys are a breath of fresh air to the music world simply because there are so many Fred Dursts and Britney Spears's out there, and these guys are doing their own thing. If you like these guys, get Buckcherry's album, Union's new album ""The Blue Room"", and the Black Crowes. BOOYA!!!"
4,Great debut effort,"Being from Ohio, I had never heard of New American Shame until I read a review in ""Metal Edge."" I was intrigued by the description and decided to buy the CD with a gift certificate I got for Christmas--and I'd have gladly shelled out $16 for it. The band reminds me of the best of 80's metal--the really hard stuff that rocked arenas. However, I can hear influences of grunge in the guitar work, which is very accomplished for a band from Seattle (a stereotype, I know, but valid considering what's come out of there before). The best thing about this record is the somewhat Southern sound it has--more like these guys came from Alabama than Washington state. Hey, the sticker on the album wrapper says it all: ""Rock isn't dead, just buy the damn album!"""
3,"A little AC/DC, a little 80's rock","Thick, bluesy riffs reminiscent of AC/DC and raspy vocals make this a addicting cd to listen to.If you like Black Crowes or Buckcherry, you will dig New American Shame."
3,Typical Darkover anthology. Some good & some very good.,"Have read & re-read all of the Darkover books several times. Just finished this book for at least the fourth time. There are only 4 or 5 stories which are up to Ms. Bradleys level, but since she picked them, all are good. Several extend some of Ms. Bradley's books ie. A Lesser Life tells of a time after and puts a happier end to STORMQUEEN."
3,Duct Fan,The fan does not move air like you would think it should. It seems like the blades don't have the correct pitch to move 500 cfm of air. Not real pleased with this product. It under performs.
1,More like 500 cfh,Actually more like 500 cubic feet per hour. Don't expect to install this thinking your going to feel air coming out the vents. Hopefully I can return this thing if not I'll have to trash it because it's not worth the electricity to run it.
2,Item not as pictured,What they show is a duct fan with two crimped ends.What you get is a duct fan with one crimped end.Nuff said.
5,Fits Great!,"Order was on time and just what was expected. Fits perfect, and completes the shower look!"
2,sadly but not very good,this cd was not very completely recorded and pretty quickly recorded due to piggy's health.there is potental but i figure they used mainly demo tracks and finished them for us to enjoy piggy's last song?or they ran out of time recording with piggy because the songs seem incomplete and lacking solos.sadly the cd will never be completed to master piece levels due to piggy's death.
4,Good but not geat.,Im big voivod fan and this one is one of my least favorites.jason does a a good job filling in for blacky. though this is a good voivod cd.
3,The sweetest nectar,"Mrs. Tamara Saunders is a social worker that married her high school sweetheart after graduating college. Seven years and one child later, the repetitiveness of Tamara and Steven's marriage is choking the life out of her. Long gone are the days of romantic rides, passionate kisses and non stop love making sessions.While confiding in her friends, Tamara, a faithful flirt, begins appreciating girls' nights out. She quickly becomes mesmerized and is completely swept away. Unable to see clearly, Tamara is the missing link. How much will she sacrifice for some borrowed time?Toya Morton-Swanson has written a mystery that moves at the speed of lightning while exploring what happens when sexual healing and revenge are combined. Though readers are hastily wrapped up in CAUGHT BETWEEN A BITCH AND A HARD PLACE, I find that it is a little too over the top. HOWEVER, I do plan to see how the excitement returns in SAME BITCH, DIFFERENT DAY."
3,For A beginner,For a 1st timer it was good....Yeah it did started off like something I have read before...Maybe b/c I read alot...But it was juicy in the middle...But it was small book....Had a little twist but it was good...
4,Enjoyable,"It started off like something I have read before until I got to the 2nd chapter, (which is where entertainment begins) and of course I had to finish reading it otherwise I would have put it on the shelf to collect dust. I finished it in 2 hours, so it held my attention. Overall the book is good I'm waiting for the follow-up, so keep up the good work."
5,Bored housewives best friend,"Could not put it down, will definitely keep you interested.Well written, HOT & STEAMY when is the sequel?"
5,THE discipleship manual for our generation!,"Anyone that wants their life to make an impact for Jesus in the world should begin with a tool like this. The principles in The Fuel and the Flame transend their university ministry setting and give practical advice and passionate vision for any person interested in making disciples. Steve's ""Fuel"" principles will deepen your walk with the Lord, and the ""Flame"" portion will spark creative and timeless ministry strategies for any sphere of life. Steve speaks this truth out of hard earned lessons in ministry, and in a way that is authentic and memorable. This is the discipleship manual for our century."
5,Motivating and Practical,"This was a very motivating book. After reading it, I believe that I can make a big difference in someone else's life for Christ. This is a book that I'd like to reread regularly."
5,Great; Practical Book!,An incredible book! Steve does a fantastic job through this book explaining how to implement a practical and biblical strategy of ministry on a college campus. He uses biblical principles plus real life situations to explain his points. I have been doing campus ministry for 7 years and I walk through this book every year with my students. I would recommend this to be read by anyone who is trying to have an impact for Christ on a college campus.
4,The Fuel and the Flame,"Steve Shadrach is a guy who has poured his life into college students. He shares his years of experience and the strategic insights he has gained in The Fuel and the Flame. The thing I love most about this book is that Steve advocates doing evangelism the way Jesus did it--which is to focus on a few and help them to become evangelists and disciple makers. This is a great book for anyone in high school or college ministry.The Fuel and The Flame: 10 Keys to Ignite Your College Campus for Jesus ChristRick Schenker, President-Ratio Christi"
1,Disappointed,"I had a Magic Chief microwave that looked exactly like this one before. I needed the built in toaster. This microwave is a much lower quality. First problem was the toaster drawer stop failed which affects the spring loaded bread holders, you have to position the drawer just right so they would open. The hinges on the main microwave door are weak and cause the door to sag down and not close properly, I have to bend it up repeatedly to close the door. And finally the toaster stopped working all together. I had it for one year, I had the Magic Chief for 5 years. I purchased this because Magic Chief model was not available anymore."
5,Wish I could read it new again!,"Compelling. This appeals on so many levels - history, mother and daughter, time travel paradox and much much more. It feels at one point as if the author let go of the handlebars and the thing wobbled badly but that flaw doesn't ruin a really good read. I'd put it in my top 10 of Time Travel books."
5,Reading over and over again,"I can't remember when I first got this book, but I've read it inumerable times. It is one of my favorites. Even though I've read it numerous times, I am always sad that it ends. I keep thinking there must be a sequal! It's not your usual time travel novel, but definitely keeps you hooked!"
5,Parallel time travel,"I have always been fascinated with the concept, and this novel presents a fantastic possibility in a romantic, but not sappy, manner.Loved it."
4,Loved It!,"I'm always on the lookout for a good time book. I think this one held up very well. The placement of the story in the west was a new location for me (I'm used to Finney-type NYC locales). The two protagonists who ""switch"" were both compelling and believable. I thought the author did a great job."
4,Thought provoking,"One of my favorite books of all-time is called ""Replay"". I purchased ""The Mirror"" since many people who had read Replay had also read this one.It is an interesting twist on time-travel, and I found the story very engaging. My only complaint is that there was an inconsistency in the plot, which made the time-travel dates not work out quite right. This bothered me to the point where I was even mapping out characters and dates to see if perhaps I had missed something.However, if you won't get too caught up in the details, it is an enjoyable story. It made me reflect on the immense adaptability and inner strength present in people when they need to call upon it."
2,"Not really a mystery, but more of a historical fiction.","My father bought this book for me thinking it was a good mystery thriller for me, since he knows I love to read the supernatural, mysteries,etc. As I started to read, it didn't really seem to be a mystery, more of a historical fiction. Thora K. Corbin and the McCabes all were all pioneer families. Shay was transported to their life and times through the mirror as her own grandmother. So things go back to pioneer life there. The book is more about Shay learning to get on in Brandy's body and learning about how to do things. I really didn't consider it a thrilling, suspenseful, or horror or mystery story.If you love ghosts/mysteries/supernatural/horror, like me, then this book is not for you. I would reccommend it to people who like to read books about the pioneer time, or who enjoy history."
2,How can this be your favorite book?,"I found this book because is is linked to Finney's Time and Again, a book which is delightful, and after I read all your glowing reviews, I couldn't wait for The Mirror! What a disappointment. Are we all talking about the same book? The plot is shallow, the character's have no depth, there are unexplained twists. What a disappointment."
1,Are we reading the same book?,"If not for the plot discriptions other readers wrote, I would think that we are reviewing different books.I read this book based upon the large number of excellent reviews and the story started as I expected. However, as the book progressed, I became less and less enamoured of it.After the first half of the book, I skimmed for about 100 pages then couldn't finish the book. I found it boring and couldn't care for the characters. The author seemed to run out of fresh ideas and should have ended the story earlier.Many of the other reviewer's comments stating that this was one of their favorite books in the 70's or the 80's. Perhaps that is why I did not agree with the reviews, I read it 30 years later and maybe the story does not age well.I recommend that you don't waste your time finding this book in the used marketplace or the library."
5,Good time travel read,This book did not go as I predicted. However it was a great read. I love time travel and this book was a very good one. I gave it to my daughter to read and she also loved it.
5,One of the best....,"This is one of the best books I have ever read. My mother gave me the book to read during a trip for school. I just finished it and I would have to say that it left me spellbound. I want to read it again, right away, but my mom wants to read it, since she forgot what it was about. Shay and Brandy have the most interesting stories. If you have a chance to get this book, you better get it right away! :) Out of a score of 10, this book is an 11!"
5,The Best,"I first read this novel around the time it was released originally. Both of my children, who were teenagers at the time, also read it. Somehow over the years, it was loaned out and never returned. For years we have discussed it and always referred to it as ""The Book"". We all agreed it was the best we ever read. I recently purchased it from Amazon and just reread it. It has lost none of the original magic. I still consider it my all-time favorite novel."
5,Wonderful!!,I love this book. It has been one of my favorites since high school!! I have re-read it many times.If you like time travel books this is a keeper.
4,a good read...but not what I'd call fantastic,"a good, solid read...interesting characters...did a good job transitioning from past to present and back again...held my interest...just not one of the best books I've ever read."
5,Time Travel Tale about Trading Lives.,"The MirrorA good tale about whether the ""good ole days"" were that good and is the future always bright. The protaganist swaps lives with her grandmother and each get a chance to experience another era that comes with the swap. It is a story of adjustments as each face the problems with living under the new set of circumstances that they find themselves, due to a mirrior that is out of the twilight zone. I enjoyed it."
4,"A good, thought-provoking read","I love any book that involves going back in time, and I enjoyed this one. It kind of drags in the middle, but stay with it. It is a very enjoyable book."
3,Unsatisfying Ending,"If unstatisfying endings annoy you,stay away from this book.While the premise of the book is intriguing,the plot is so convoluted and some passages so poorly written,that the book is difficult to follow.The last one third of the book seems as if it is tacked on hastily and does not offer an appropriate resolution to the detailed plotline.It is deeply disappointing and unsatisfying.I am left with more frustration than enjoyment."
5,Excellent,This is a wonderful book. I enjoyed it completely. Thora K was my favorite character. Read this this is good!!!!!
2,Not Jack Finney,"This book doesn't come close to the quality of the Jack Finney time travel stories. The Mirror, written in 1978, is a semi-psychological horror story about two women who exchange bodies and move into different times. The historical information about Boulder Colorado and its surrounding area is interesting. But the rest is all about how the two women adjust (or not) to the new times in which they are living. Since the book is 32 years old, it has some ""racy"" (for the times) interest in sexuality. The first part is lengthy, the middle is confusing in its attempt to provide a logical explanation for the Mirror's actions, and the end is just tying up loose threads. Very unsatisfying! Needs editing!"
1,Make it end-Audible edition,"I am almost to the end of the story, and I am so depressed. These are unpleasant, self absorbed people, and I am sorry that I ever met them. I hate the way they treat each other and even the animals around them. I cannot relate to Brandy or Shay because they seem to lack any real identifiable emotion that would make them empathetic characters. Brandy seems to pout throughout the story, and I don't think it is just the way the reader is choosing to portray the character. Her interactions with her family, in the past and present, lack any real depth, and I find her cold. I can say the same for Shay. The idea of the story seemed so promising, and I liked that the author chose to portray the story as more realistic and less romantic than might otherwise have been, but the actual result takes a good idea and peoples it with unpleasant, dysfunctional people too damaged to be interesting or anything but sterile."
4,Purchase of Used Book,"The book I purcahsed ""The Mirror"" is an old book, but was in good condition as promised. It was delivered promptly. I am very satisfied with my purchase."
4,Great read!,"This was a great book to read. It wasn't the best book I've ever read, but it was one that I couldn't put down. The story was well presented and the characters came to life for me. If you need a book for pure escape, this is it!"
5,Still a favorite after all these years,"I have a hard back copy (original edition) of this book that I read many years ago (let's not get into the whole age thing here) and I fell in love with the story and the characters. It's still one of my favorite books and, believe me, I've read a LOT of books since this one! Pick up a copy and give it a try - you won't be disappointed if you like time travel and great characters!!"
3,Hobbyist Guide to Catfish and more Catfish,"If you're into loaches, this book lacks in information. Most of the book concentrates on catfish. There is a section recounting an incident of clown loaches bred in captivity, but that's about it. A little disappointing for loach lovers."
1,No pictures or diagrams.,"Was very disappointed. This book merely describe the trap, it did not show the trap. Over all this book does me very little good. DO NOT buy if you want t o learn how yt? o build traps."
5,The best cooler.,"Best fan CPU cooler on earth, my X2 AMD is running cool and happy. Also, you can't get quieter than this unless you go for passive or water cooling. It may appear expensive but it's worth it."
5,As quiet as it can get,"It really cools down my 6400 X2 AMD processor. Although I have it connected downwards, the fan blows from top to bottom, this way it cools down my northbridge and my video card as well... It's really quiet, unbelievable!"
4,A Tropical Trip To Terror!,"Stuart Woods takes readers down to the Caribbean with Stone Barrington. Stone has to help prove the innocence of a beautiful woman, Allison, who is accused of murdering her husband. Throughout the trial, Stone tries to defend her reputation and his own. Overall a good book, but a depressing ending."
5,Arrived timely and in good condition,The book arrived within the time and condition promised. I was very pleased the book arrived so quickly.
2,A little bit bland,My first Stuart Woods novel. It was a little bland with characters that could have been more developed and a slow start. I finished the book but didn't feel like this was something that was extremely mesmerizing nor captivating. If you have nothing else to read I suppose this is the book for you.
1,I Thought I was the only one!,"I was very pleased to see someone else comment on the slow dim dialogue in this book - it was PAINFUL. Page after page was spent on such exciting things as preparing a Caesar salad and other exciting tangents. The story moved slooowly and the plot, characters and ending were all terribly lacking. None of these lacked as much as the motivation for ANY character. I was so moved by how poorly this book ended that I had to come here and ""warn"" others! I am not a tough critic, but this book was a stinker."
3,Just Dead,"Stuart Woods has quickly become one of my all-time favorite authors, however, I found this Stone Barrington series to be a little bit far-fetched and not so good (as compared to his others in the series). Woods does a great job of maintaining a great character in Stone, I just did like some of things that Stone did in the book. He is supposed to be madly in love with Arrington, yet he keeps finding comfort in the arms of others. I guess it goes with Stone's character loving many different women. The ending was very far-fetched and kind of a letdown. If you have never read Woods before, I would suggest that you not make this your first novel of his that you read. Instead, go with ""New York Dead,"" ""L.A. Times,"" or ""The Run"". Not that this book isn't good, it is just definitely not his best."
3,Good...but no cigar...,"I had the fortune of listening to this book as read by Richard Ferrone. What a build up! What characters! What a scenario! Too bad none of it goes anywhere. Of course, I cannot go into too many narrative details but suffice to say the ending is very disappointing...and things you felt should have happened didn't. Perhaps the greatest disappointment of all was the author using the ending as the beginning of another book...as though I want to read something else equally as dissatisfying?"
5,DEAD IN THE WATER,THIS BOOK KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT. I LOST A LOT OF SLEEP CAUSE I COULDNT PUT THE BOOK DOWN. STUART WOODS HAS DEFINANTLY OUT DOWN HIMSELF. THIS BOOK IS AS GOOD AS NEW YORK DEAD. I VE READ MOST OF HIS BOOKS AND THIS BOOK KICKS BUTT. THIS BOOK IS A DEFIANT THRILLER. CANT FALL ASLEEP READING IT
3,Could have been better,"This was fairly entertaining, but as in other books by Mr. Woods, you need to leave reality at the door and just go with the hero and his epic libido. Best to wait for the paperback unless you have the rebate coupon from his last."
4,Dead in the Water is Not A Dead Story,"... The author was effective in keeping my attention because not only was there the suspense of the sexual tension, she threaded the suspense of trying to find the real murderer throughout the novel."
4,GREAT BEACH READING,"So it wasn't War and Peace but it was a Stone Barrington sequel and I love his charachters and the characters he finds and socializes with. The ending was not a complete surprise, however Mr.Woods drew it out instead of just figuring it out and ending it there. I will now read Swimming to Catalina."
4,By the end I realized that I really enjoyed the story,"This is my first Stuart Woods book I have read. I was a little put off at the relationship between Stone and Allision. I found it to be unrealistic. Because of this relationship I was convinced in her guilt. I found that there were moments in the when I was in total shock. I will definetly read another of his books. All in all, it was a thrilling story"
3,Not bad,"A friend of mine gave this to me, and being the print addict that I am, I read it. Interesting storyline, but Woods doesn't go very deeply into character development, except for when it's time to cook something. A pleasant beach read, but that's about it."
5,sexy and entertaining...Woods hits again!,"My tenth Woods book ranks up there with New York Dead and Santa Fe Rules...hey, so what if he is a ""tabloid writer""... this is great entertainment...a wonderful beach or rainy day read...Stone Barrington from New York Dead and Dirt is back!... Woods throws a little more descriptive sex in this one which might turn off some readers, but who could resist the charms of Allison Manning?...the ending leaves us hungry for Swimming to Catalina with Stone."
1,A disappointment. I won't read another Stuart Woods book.,"This book was extremely disappointing. I had never read Stuart Woods before and don't expect to read him again. The characters were shallow, the plot unrealistic, and the writing sophomoric. The only redeeming value is that I could finish the book on one overseas trip (and leave it in the airport because I wouldn't want anyone else to PAY for reading this book)."
1,"Unbelieveably bad, unbelievable plot.","A friend at work recommended Stuart Woods and lent me this book. What a disappointment! The plot is so far fetched and riduculous, I lost interest midway through the book. The main character has no moral character and I wished I'd never met him. It's an insult to our society that even one copy of this book was sold."
4,DEAD IN THE WATER,"WHEN YOU MIX TOGETHER THE FOLLOWING ELEMENTS: LOVE, MYSTERY, MURDER,SUSPENSE AND AN UNSUAL SETTING YOU GET A WINNER. WORTH READING."
2,readable,This book is filled with cliches and sterotypical characters and on the whole is a quite shallow but entertaining enough read.
3,Odd man out,"I did not think this book was as good as it sounded. I found it a bit long winded, but readable. There were a lot of Philadephia slang and references that make me wonder if one does not come from Philly, if they will get the true meaning. I've read other books by this author and I just didnt think this one measured up."
2,Could not get interested.,"This book did not engage me, and I tried several times to get past page 100. Nothing clicked for me."
2,The Rosary Girls is derived from TV,"Jeez, some off you gave this book 5 stars! Can't you see that Richard Montanari has just repackaged every television cop stereotype since Dragnet? In fact, the entire book seems derived from TV, except the fact that the main character, Jessica is a beautiful female boxer. What an original concept! Although it served ABSOLUTELY NO PURPOSE in the book, I'm thinking Mr. Montanari might have an Oscar-Winning Movie concept here. Ha! Look for my copy of this book on ebay. I'm posting it for auction starting at $.99."
5,Rosary Girls,This is the best mystery/thriller I have read in past few years. Hard to put down and dosen't dissapoint at the end.Harry K
2,Just not that interesting,"This book was not as interesting as I had hoped. The book did have some good parts but sadly, they were not strong enough to hold my interest. The main characters were very 2 dimensional, despite the author's efforts to make them have depth. One thing that really bothered me about the female character was that she had a 18 month old that she apparently spent very little time with - I guess because her childcare situation was 24/7. she apparently could drop the kid off at a neighbors morning, noon or night without warning. I didn't bother to finish the book because despite plodding through most of the largely slow paced book, I realized I didn't care who was killing the girls."
2,Didn't bother to finish it...,"Took this book on my beach vacation and no matter how hard I tried, it just didn't interest me enough to finish it. I hate wasting my money but hate wasting my time even more. The characters and plot were just not believable, and there are much better choices out there."
1,"Really Bad, no Michael at ALL","This DVD it's a Scam ,do not buy it.This woman showing peoples protesting in front of the court house, and talking about peoples, no Michael Jackson at all, And when you buy something about Michael, please be about Michael, do not Buy don't waist your money like me !"
1,Worst DVD Purchase Ever,Worst DVD ever purchased. All this DVD consisted of was footage seen on the news hundreds of times before. Weak weak weak! Anyone who give this a 5 star is somehow connected with the production of this. My copy can be had for $5!
3,Michael Jackson - The Trial and Triumph of the King of Pop,Some of the footage was disturbance and their was time when it was okay. I learned a unpleasing tale in the firm.
1,I rented it on demand for $4.99 and felt it wasn't worth the money,"I've been an MJ fan for a long time and right after he passed away Time Warner Cable had this available on demand. I rented it, watched it, and it sucked. Like said by other viewers the quality was poor. Don't waste your time and money."
1,Not worth buying,This was a very disappointing and not worth buying at all. There are so much better products if you really want to see information in regards to Michael Jackson.
1,For quality this bad... it should be left for download on YT instead,"Really... If you're going to sell an unlicensed product, at least make them high quality. The quality in this product is very poor. Why not just upload it on Youtube and watch it for free there today? Oh wait! It IS on Youtube! <_<"
1,DO NOT BUY !!! BIG WASTE OF MONEY,I wish I could get my money back !!!!! this is just some lady standing outside the courthouse during the Michael Jackson trial talking and filming the supporters & protesters.This DVD should get a ZERO star rating -- but the system would not let me post my review until I gave a star. DO NOT BUY ...I REPEAT DO NOT BUY... U will be dissapointed -- the positive reviews must be comming from the folks that made the DVD
1,Just Plain Awful!,"It is criminal that people can actually make money off of this fluff. It is so unprofessionally done. Thank goodness I only rented it on Amazon as opposed to buying it. It is just awful! I can appreciate the makers of this trash trying to debunk some of the falsehoods about MJ; however, the production quality takes away from the effort. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!! I rented it for $2.99 and I feel ripped off. I should have known better considering someone named Pearl Jr. is listed as the host of this garbage. If anyone claims this is a good video, they are lying--point blank. The lady hosting this fluff (masquerading as a hard hitting journalist) is beyond weird. Save your money. Buy MJ's DVD collection instead (""Dangerous"", History I and II). It will be a whole lot more satisfying than watching this trainwreck."
3,The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer DVD,The movie was not close enough to the book for me...they did a good job on it though.
3,Love it but wish it's better,"For a Stephen King's fan, I really have to have this DVD in my collection. This is a great movie to watched except that, He shouldn't have cut short the accounts of their year of honeymoon and there's also a slight steepness in the story. Rather have this movie in a more deeper spectative in story.The upper side of this movie is that you left wondering if Rose Red really exist."
1,Diary of Ellen Rimbauer,I read the book before seeing the movie. The book was good. The movie was terrible. I did not like it at all. The movie did not follow the book. The movie had inaccurate accounts compared to the book and the Rose Red movie.
1,Disappointing,"The book The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer was absoluteley riveting. The movie left out all the essential character building storyline. The Rimbauer's entire year of travel was cut into a couple of quick scenes (and they are completely inconsistent with the book). You are let in on secrets too early and without any background. Suspense is built on not knowing everything right away.You never get a sense of Rose Red as a character, when she is supposed to be the driving force of the story. The movie cut and pasted events and character roles into places where they do not make sense or are ineffective. I had to force myself to watch the rest of the movie...and it didn't get any better. Scary? I don't think so. Don't waste your time."
2,Strange.....,"Since the rest of the reviewers on this page have said it best, Ill simply give my two cents and point out a huge screw up on the DVD side of things.The movie is decent. They use the original sets from Rose Red( which is a big plus because the house is what made the movie in my opinion) the acting is fairly well done and the story sets the stage for Rose Red itself.BUT there is one huge flaw in the production of this DVD. When you click on the ""scene selection"" option on the menu, another movies clips show up. Yes thats right, Lions Gate put ANOTHER films pictures in the selection menu with titles from The Diary of Ellen Rembauer. Its an asian film from the looks of it, and is also probably much creepier in that just the pictures from this film gave me the jitters.Well thats it, go check out the movie for its prequal info, and then look at its interesting mess up. And if anyone could tell me what movie they mixed the scene selection up with, Id like to know, it looks rather good!"
2,Prequel To Rose Red......,"Being a huge Stephen King fan ( I think the man is brilliant ! ) I saw Rose Red and enjoyed it. When The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer came out, I was interested in seeing it so I bought the movie. Although not as good as Rose Red, this movie is just ok. Set in the early 20th century, this movie shows us why Rose Red became a haunted mansion. It tells the story of Ellen Rimbauer who marries a wealthy man and inherits the mansion named Rose Red. When strange things begin to happen in the mansion beginning with her husband's strange behavior, Ellen begins to question both her husband and what could have happened in this mansion to make it haunted. Crawling with ghosts and spirits, Ellen begins to research Rose Red and doesn't like what she finds. Good special effects but can be boring at times. Only worth renting, I wouldn't suggest buying this movie unless you have seen it first."
4,i like it.,"this movie is good, if you buy rose red to go with it. this sets up the whole story from begining to end, it would'nt make much sence if you dont have the whole story. i would recamend it to people who like gost storys, family gost mesterys. i loved the whole story its one of my favorits"
1,not enough info,wasnt what i thought it was going to be and it is very short and not very detailed like it should be
4,Diary of Ellen Rimbauer,"Good show, I just finished reading the book and wanted finish it up. I enjoyed it but the book was much better."
5,Great Movie,I love Rose Red. I think it is a GREAT scary movie. I didn't know till years later about The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer. Which explans how Rose Red was born. I think I enjoy this movie more then Rose Red. I am very happy I own both movies. The two movies are a must see together.
3,Good for non-Blu Ray,"Popped it into my Samsung Blu-Ray, it was a nonstarter. Have my standard DVD player also hooked to 'the Regza' and still looked nice. Would have been nice if it played on the Blu-Ray, but oh well.Just read that an update to the Blu-Ray software may help this issue and will try to find out and post if it works."
3,Not as Good as Rose Red,"I'll be honest, my expectations were very high when I purchased this DVD. Rose Red was such an incredible movie. The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer is worth watching if you have seen Rose Red but in many ways it does not live up to Rose Red.The movie seemed rushed to me. Especially the scenes where they were traveling around the world. I had a hard time seeing the characters connect and the storyline could have been much better. The sex scenes to me seemed to make no sense at all or add to the movie for it's time back then and seemed unbelievable.On a bright side, it was nice to see the return of Sukeena, played effectively by Tsidii Le Loka.Don't have your expectations too high and you might just enjoy this one, somewhat."
2,A LITTLE LET DOWN,"This movie is a big let down if you have read the book. The movie leaves out certain key characters and events because of time. I think it would have been much better if I had seen the movie, THEN read the book. Look for the actual writer of The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer, who plays the Rimbauers head butler. This DVD is 88min. long and the only extra feature is the commentary."
1,The Disjointed Diary,High points for production details but no thought went into the disjointed totally inconsistent plot.Just don't waste your time on this.... not scary or sexy or entertaining. Take a walk instead.
4,Must see if you have watched rose red,"I ordered this movie after seeing the Stephen King movie ""Rose Red."" The movie adds history and gives you a more indepth veiw of Ellen Rimbaur and her life before her death. The acting is ok, totally not Oscar winning acting, but not bad for a straight to DVD movie. If you have not seen ""Rose Red"" I would watch this first then watch ""Rose Red"" becouse it is a prequal.If you are a Stephen King fan, like sci-fi ish mysterys and movis tha that take place in the early 1900 I would recommend this movie."
3,No scale or TSA combination Locks on my case,Description and picture are not exact match for the product. It's a nice case for a 100 bucks but the main reason I ordered it beyond looks was for the scale and the locks that were not included on the case I received but are described and pictured above. Otherwise it's small but I like it to have ready to throw in the car anytime. If it had the scale and locks I would give it 5 stars.
2,Warning-this is not a clarinet CD,"This is a recording of a German radio jazz band, with a featured appearance by Eddie Daniels. They are good--quite tight and disciplined, he is good--his ability to precisely jump up and down the scale is beyond the capacity of the normal human embechure, but the combination just does not work. The HR band is loud, brassy, and basically they are trying too hard. Those cats can't swing. Eddie has to use real pyrotechnics to try to keep up with them. The melodies are familiar, but the arrangements are not the best. It is a confused approach. The CD is OK listening in the car, just to admire the technical skill of all the players and forget about rush hour traffic, but one can do better:If you want big brass, get Maynard Furgeson. If you want German precision, get a Deutsche Grammaphon recording of Bach, Mozart, etc. If you want Eddie Daniels, ""Benny Rides Again"" with Gary Burton works much better."
2,Tami won't let you reflect,"The use of a forceful, halting, overly enunciated speech pattern makes this a terrible disc for relaxation. None of the language seems to flow naturally from the speaker. Is she trying to ""keep time"" or end the spoken word before the harp solos? The first script leaves something to be desired, too. Harp music is nice, but the second track zaps you wide awake and the startling voice begins again. The music for track 2 is too active for drifting into peaceful place."
3,OK for the price.,"This is an okay product for the price. However I expected a little more quality. The chips are a step up from the cheapie plastic ones, but of course they are not as good as clay chips or even the clay/composite chips. The chips on the display case are different than the ones that come inside the package. The display shows a diamond design with white stripes, the ones inside have a suited design with no white stripes. Also the chips appear to have a dirty, stained look to them unlike the slick, clean look on the display case. The felt playing surface included is just plain green. It would have been nice if it had hold'em markings on it. Bottom line...for $19.99 or less this is a good product and I recommend it for fun home tourny games. But Cardinal Industries could have put a little more effort into this package."
1,Very Disappointed!,"I do not recommend anyone to buy from this seller, Cardinal Industries. I bought The Deluxe Texas Hold'Em Set in a Tin container, supposedly NEW. After opening the container I found that the plastic containing the chips was ripped and missing the dealer button, missing 28 chips and one of them is broken.The return policy states that Items should be unopened or in original condition, how can we know what's missing without opening the container?This is a rip-off!!!Save your money and buy from someone else."
3,Different indeed,"I was disappointed in this release, it just did nothing for me despite repeated listenings. Yet as a fan, I will buy all their releases due to the fact that so many of them are excellent. I just couldn't wrap my ears around this one."
4,maybe their best,"This is possibly the best Ozric disc so far. While previous discs like Strangitude and even Waterfall Cities have their rock/funk tunes, their techno/rave tunes, and so forth, with this latest release, the band never really loses sight of any of its diverse influences. Although certain tracks lean in certain directions, this is definately the most coheasive Ozric's CD, if not their best. This is a great choice for those who are more into the rock/funk side of the band, rather than the electronic side, not because it's more prominent, but because the more techno oriented moments still reveal the same great musicianship. I do think that the bass could be a bit more exposed at times, but that's picky. Become the Other is another good one in the same respect."
5,Ozrics - Hidden Step,"Ozrics have done it again. A brilliant follow-up to Waterfall Cities. From sequency syncopations on the title track and Tight Spin to typical Ozric rock grooves on Holohedron and Pixel Dream to middle eastern influenced Ashlandi Bol and Ta Khut and a trance-inducing Aramanu, there's not a clunker to be found on this disk. A very strong offering from Ed, Seaweed, Zia, John and (now not with the group) Rad."
1,Great Movie; Terrible Disc,"One of the best movies of the genre but unwatchable on this disc. Terrible quality, terrible out of sync dubbing. Look for one that has good quality reviews...this one is a total bust...like watching a VHS made from someone who filmed it (ala Kramer in Sienfeld) at the movies"
3,"Good story, but cliched characters and conclusion drag","This was my first Hall book and I was definitely impressed with his storytelling and the use of action throughout the book. The story is multi-layered and exciting and the various jumping plots conclude cleanly. However, I didn't really think Hannah Keller was a very strong character, she doesn't interact well with the other characters and she seems recycled from other mystery heroines forced to take justice into their own hands. I also didn't care for Hal Bonner, it seems Hall made him the most vile, disgusting man on the face of the earth, and gave him a boring trademark killing method that just gets annoying after a while. I enjoyed the cat and mouse theatrics and the dialogue but Hall definitely went way overboard in his characters, they aren't fascinating at all, their actually quite boring and sad."
4,"good book, but cliched ending","This was my first James Hall book, and I plan to read some more in the future as he seems to be a very good writer. His writing flows clean and easy, making for a fast paced read. The main characters Hannah and Frank were good, but I would have liked to see a little more depth into Frank. Hal and Misty are also good villians, but Hal is perhaps a bit cartoonish, particularily his method of killing. The plot was interesting and had some original ideas compared to the typical plot in the genre. The only problem was that you could see how it would end from a mile away. Although the identity of Hannah's parents killer was a nice suprise. Overall, a good read."
5,DELECTABLE ITALIAN RECIPES,These are family recipes with no omissions that are often made by those of us who are not professionals. This book dates back to 1975. The Romanagnolis' Tablewas broadcasted live on TV in California. I was visiting there at the time. I purchased the book and have cooked from it extensively. I made notes on the recipes I tried. Amazon has made it available to us again.
4,Exactly what I was looking for,I first saw this book when I was newly married.. My husband brought it into the marriage and I was able to recreate a lot of the dishes he grew up on through the wonderful recipes. Love this book!
1,royal bloodlines,"Thought it was terrible. Sounds like a Southern preacher. No images worth anything. He sounds obsessed with Satan, a word he repeats over and over.Sorry I was misled in buying this. Thought it would be something interesting and worthwhile."
3,Pretty bad video; pretty good music,"As a fan of the Pretty Things, I was pleased to see a video of a live performance other than just SF Sorrow. The music is quite good, but the video itself seems to have been shot by amateurs. Heads are sometimes cut off and the struggles of the photographer to center the images is apparent; it looks like a hand-held camcorder video.However, the product came with a cd of the concert, which was not advertised, and that is quite good. ""Havana Bound,"" ""Rosalyn"" and ""Don't Bring Me Down"" are my favorite tracks. Having never seen the Pretty Things in concert, there is one aggravating aspect which sticks out: Phil May doesn't like to let a song end without saying ""Baby.""Still, it's amazing these guys are still around and any fan of their music should find the cd enjoyable. If you are looking for better video, the live version of SF Sorrow is superior, though I will never understand their fascination with Arthur Brown."
1,"Bloody commie propaganda, not history!","This is one of the most pathetic attempt by a senile Marxist pseudo historian to glorify the bloody regime in North korea, and a boring read at that.Avoid Cumings at all cost."
1,Didnt enjoy it,Just wasnt the right book for me I needed insight and help about moving forward with life being child free now after deciding I cant go through more IVF and it wasnt the right book for me skipped over it didnt hold my interest at all.
1,Wrong Book?,"It's pretty annoying when you're looking for the second edition of a textbook and clicking a link to the kindle version gives you the kindle version of the first edition of the book.How does that make any sense. Most, if not all of the section numbers are different for the two editions of the book. People will just accidentally buy this ebook version not knowing they're actually buying the first edition. Pretty ridiculous."
1,This is not the Second Edition!,"I purchased this book for a class, having just received a new Kindle, I figured I'd try to go the ebook route. Unfortunately, the book I wanted was the second edition (Combinatorics and Graph Theory (Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics)), this was the 'Kindle version' linked to the page of that book. This ebook based on the first edition!Although, when looking closely at the webpage, the product details of this ebook do state 'first edition'. It could be improperly inferred that it is the first edition of the Kindle version. I do not think that the Kindle version of an old edition should be linked to the page of a newer edition, because then people are tempted to purchase it thinking that the books will be exactly the same. Sections have changed, so theorem numbers have shifted, hence I will probably have to buy the second edition as well."
5,Replacement,"When I bought my car, the glass from driver side headlight assembly was broken and had a big chuck missing.I finally got it replaced and I'm pretty happy that I have. The new lights are brighter than the right side but if you look carefully you can certainly tell that the two head lights are different. Not that big of a deal though."
3,Cute,"Cute and funny, but I'm gladI didn't wear it to the intended party becausewhen I got there, the hostess' hair looked just like it! She would have thought I was making fun of her."
2,Wish I Liked it Better,"I ordered this and tried it for several weeks. It was creamy and smelled good. BUT, it left my hair feeling stripped and tangled. My hair is NOT long. I would hate to see what it would do with long hair. Maybe it just doesn't work for my hair type. I am a 52 year old female with moderately coarse, wavy hair. I just recently decided to go completely gray. It is very liberating and I love the color, which is white rather than gray. It may work fine for you, but for me, I have a bottle that I can't use. It would have also been nice to have had more info in English. Everything is in French. But then I am weird in that I like to read everything about it. Of course, it comes from France, so why would I expect English? I am going back to the Wen Hair System."
2,Make It Stop!!!!!!!,"Would someone please put Yoko out of her screeching misery! ""We're All Water"" is enough torture to make me confess to anything! I realize the rage at the time was Scream or Primal Therapy, but give me a break. After 'we're all water'.....we're all deaf!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Sometime in the 21st Century,"Aside from their late '60s experimental albums, ""Sometime in New York City"" remains Johnandyoko's weakest effort. Yoko improves this remastered reissue by shaving off half of the ""Live Jam"" portion, with ""Jambag,"" ""Scumbag"" and ""Au"" all coming under the ax. Oddly, she also edits her own ""Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for a Hand in the Snow)"" and takes two minutes off of the end of ""We're All Water,"" probably her best song on the album. She adds the single ""Happy Xmas (War is Over)"" and her own terrific ""Listen, the Snow is Falling."" Over all, it's an improvement on any prior edition, but especially over the muddy-sounding 1990 CD."
2,What happened to the Live Jam????,"I was looking forward to listening to a remastered version of ""Scumbag"" but it looks like it isn't going to happen. This is like removing the Apple Jam Cd from All Things Must Pass."
4,WWII Memoir of a Japanese Boy,"This highly readable memoir of the life of a boy living through the period just before, during and just after World War 2 brings immediacy and a true to life quality that makes this book pleasantly enjoyable.The book is long, but it progresses in a very rapid style that creates a feeling as if the reader is there with the narrator in Japan.Although he book generally rings true, the absence of any reference whatsoever to the sexuality that characterizes adolescence is the one discordant note."
1,"Yes, this book was proven a sort of forgery in Japan","I warrant the quality of Hitoshi Noguchi,MD's Review. It is also good summary of the criticisms in Japan."
5,This book offended me just like I needed,"Yes, Dr. Laura is offensive. However, she also has a strong understanding of God's will, and the numerous challenges in our life that take us away from God. This hard hitting advice is just what I needed in my life, and has had a profound affect on me. For example, when she tells you under ""stupid ambition"" that you should have a job that helps you be a good father and husband, instead of expecting your family to only sustain you in your job, she is hitting the nail on the head. Also, her candid and insightful stories on why we men will be happier in a long term, monogamous marriage are very inspiring. Most of God's servants have offended society, Dr. Laura is no exception."
5,Great--the opinion of a man who did some stupid things!,"This has a lot of good sense, that unfortunately doesn't seem to be common sense anymore. More men and women need to get the message which this book presents."
4,gift for son,"I bought this as a gift for my son as recommended by a friend. I doubt he""ll read it, but if he does, he might learn something. :)"
5,I wish I had it before I got married...,"I am proud -- I did not make all ten stupid things. I wish I had such book before I got married the first time. Luckily, I have it before I am getting married second time. I read a copy from library and now buying one on my own. It is a good addition to Dr.Laura's radio show. On the radio you have only a couple of minutes per topic, but here you have a whole chapter."
1,Just as bad as her book about women,"Dr. Laura should have grown up in my family. My Mother is the sports fan and my Father loves tthe soaps. They both worked and we grew up as very happy ""latch-key"" children. In this book Dr. Laura (the physiologist) attempts, in her tedious prose, to compartmentalize men as she did women in her previous book. She is more lenient with the guys, however, blaming a lot of their ""stupid"" activities on their women. A well-known hater of her own sex, Schlessinger seems to be using her books for the sole purpose of attacking women."
2,a primma donna mentality,"In this particular book,Dr. Laura wants to argue both sides of the fence. On one hand, many behaviors assumed masculine are stupid, but she wants men to be masculine when she wants her doors held open, her meals paid for, etc. I think it was in the ""stupid marriage"" chapter where she tells men to avoid 'androgynous' women. Now what basis does she use for saying that there should be masculinity, and femininity? The Torah? Supernatural signs and wonders? No! Her own opinion! Presented as Divine Law, equal to the Ten Commandments. It's an attitude of arrogance, that women think they have a right to dictate masculinity, anymore than when men used to dictate femininity to women. Instead of the subservient woman, we have a new kind of anti-feminist: the woman who can do whatever she wants, but He has to pay my meals."
1,"Misogynistic (yes, you read that correctly)","I was relieved to see that another reviewer took note of ""Dr."" Laura's profound animosity towards her own sex.I couldn't finish this book. It offended me far too much. In Schlessinger's opinion, it seems that the ""stupid"" things men do are all the fault of the women in their lives. According to her, the only ""stupid"" thing a man can actually do is associate with the wrong woman. (My Lord, it was the woman! SHE told me to eat the apple!) She also spends an inordinate amount of time excusing sexist and inappropriate male behavior as ""biological.""I don't like walking around all day seething with anger, so I closed the book. I suggest you do the same."
2,Closer to 2 1/2 stars,"Dr(?) Laura does make some solid points in this, but most of the bottom-feeders that need to read this, won't. Her biggest problem is using her concept of a god, to *prove* that what she says is correct. Instead of just stating that such and such type of behavior is not correct, she has to use a particular religion to *prove* it. Always be leary of using a religion as the foundation to build your arguement on. Laura evidently feels that there is only one valid religion and uses it to write her books. As any logical person realizes, there can only be one valid religion or none at all. In Laura S's, the Judeo/Christian is THE valid religion and bases her interpretations on that belief systems. Gee Whiz, that ignores the millions of Buddhists..Muslims..Confucious' etc. Religion wise Laura, you are in the minority...Cheers"
5,The most important book I ever read,This book changed my way of thinking which has changed my life. Stupid Ambition and Stupid Sex were controlling me and I was not seeing the true meaning of living life. This book kicked me where I needed it. God Bless DRLAURA!
4,very good,I normally like frommers is better but this book for this city blew frommers outta the water. Way better. Better organanized and more maps pointing to where stuff is. It also gave more of a detailed description of evertything.
2,decent guide book but bogus page references,"This might be the best Chicago guide book available -- I don't know of a better alternative, but I think I would look for one if I were traveling there again. The biggest problem is that very many of the page number references throughout the book are just plain wrong! For example on page 51 in the section titled Famous Loop Architecture is a reference to tours offered by the Chicago Architecture Foundation on page 262. But page 262 has sections for Relocating, Safety, Taxes, and Telephone usage -- nothing about Chicago Architecture Foundation or tours or architecture. Sometimes it's possible to find the reference a few pages nearby the referred page but at least half the time I just had to scratch my head and wonder.Also the book is laid out quite differently from other LP books. I've used LP books all over the world and this one just wasn't as helpful as I hoped."
2,Not the one I remembered!,"I don't know why they didn't release all the episodes together either. (well I guess I do $$$$ get us to buy this multiple times) anyway I was disappointed that this was not the one I was hoping for....My children didn't want to finish this movie and I doubt they will pick it out again, but they loved the book."
5,Nocturnal Frogs Having Fun? Count Me In!,"I should be totally honest and let you know that I am a huge David Wiesner fan. Tuesday is another amazing picture book from David Weisner that has vivid, creative, and humorous illustrations that let you and the little ones run wild with your imaginations. The concept is so simple and yet so great - create your own story with some nocturnal frogs on a flying adventure in a suburban neighborhood!I quickly realized that long and wordy books, no matter how awesome, are not my friends when it comes to reading out loud to little ones as they can get tiring reading over and over again.I think this works well for kids 2 and older and is great for using your imagination since there's no written story and you can really create a lot of variations of the story. Little ones will remember the slight nuances in the ""story"" but will also love to hear slight variations. This book also gives kids a good opportunity to practice their own ""storytelling"" skills."
5,Best Picture Book,"I am a retired school teacher with 25 years of experience in the classroom. I highly recommend this book for all children as a ""read-aloud"" book. Although the book has no words, the pictures ""tell"" everything that is happening in the story. I ""read"" this book to my grandsons with as much enthusiasm as I can! They love it and it has quickly become their favorite book for me to read to them. Ad-lib as much as possible when reading!! Pre-schoolers and K-3rd graders like it best! The pictures are fabulous!!"
1,Are you kidding me?,"This book was sent home from school with my son as a book report book. But there is nothing to report. There are less than ten words in this book. It was no challenge to his reading. The story is told in pictures. Rather creepy pictures to be honest. Frogs that fly around town and into homes in the middle of the night? Could definitely be creepy. This book is not worth $7.99, not even close. Don't bother."
1,Not for the little ones,"The pictures in this book are great, but the theme is not for little ones. In fact, it is a recipe for bad dreams. My three year old does not need to think about frogs flying in through her window, frogs chasing dogs out of the house, and the like at bedtime in a 50's Sci-Fi look. An award winner for art, yes. An award winner as a children's story, NO!"
5,Magnificent Illustrations,"This book is a wonderful stimulus for a kid's imagination. My niece, on her 3rd birthday, kept staring at the many pictures over and over, and totally loved this wondeful book. She now has an incredible love of frogs and toads. This is an excellent book!"
3,clever,my daughter told me to talk to the book. I didnt realize there were no words. I made them up and it was interesting.
3,good durable product,"I have used a few different cdr's, and they seem to be very easily damaged. This is a constant problem and it is hard to maintain the safety of your cds if you are working with a large amount of them. This product comes with INFOGAURD which helps to protect the cd from scrathes and fingerprnts. I havn't noticed this feature in many other affordable cdrs, so when wanting to buy in bulk and maintain your data, this product works very well. many bulk cdr packages come with little or no extra packaging, these come with a seperate cd case for each cd, which is helpful. overall it is a good durable product that I would recommend to anyone who is worried about the durabilty of cds."
3,variable quality,"This is an interesting book - the main thing to know about is the variability of the chapters. Some are really excellent, others, at best, so-so. Although the book jacket says the authors are world leaders or some such this is only really true for a few of the authors - others you've never heard of. The chapters which are excellent are really good. The inconsistent chapters probably have to do with the fact that all authors are pulled from the same place - Am. Psychiatric Publishing is also not known for high quality!"
3,More on Nab than on Ku,"An easy read, especially if you are familiar with Nabokov. However, this is less for the film student than for the literature man. Corliss' copy-cat prose matches Nabokov to even the use of the same words. It is obvious that Corliss knows his Nabokov history and literature, and surely has seen the film Lolita more than once. But the discussion overall of the film will leave the film student not knowing anymore than he already did. He just may be inspired to read Nabokov instead."
1,Poor video quality,"Not only is this video lip-synced, but the video quality is bad. I guess they wanted to do this video as cheaply as possible so they didn't bother to get an orchestra and let the man sing. Too bad this is the only Christmas video with Johnny."
5,H I R O S H I M A S T O N E S ROCKS!,"What a fabulous story!I can't wait to see the movie in 2005. It's going to be incredible!This book has probably, no definitely, the greatest sex/love scene I've ever read. (No, it's not porno, but very discreet).You totally fall in love with the characters, even though they have problems (lust, fear, rage).Read it! It'll blow your mind and change your life.You won't even feel the time passing.This is one of those rare reading experiences that completely, rapturously transports you to another place and time."
3,Facts blurred by fiction,"Any time an author uses fiction as a vehicle to certify a point of view, I question the selective supporting cast of facts. This was a powerful, off-the-wall, unconventional, but disjointed series of scenes, more an essay than a novel. None the less, it was a moving and thoughtful anti-war protest."
5,A most insightful work.,"Mr. Nilsson has created a brisk, compelling tale, apparently designed to rip the sleepy eyelids off of the MTV Generation so that they may see history for perhaps the first time.An excellent purchase."
5,Finally!- A Book That Makes Sense!!,"This is a great book for women who have heard to many old tales about sex being a chore,or something you do for someone else....let yourself go and regain your energy....and also\ sex is great for the cardiovascular system!"
2,What? Why?,"I couldn't believe it when I saw this thing at the book store! This book is ridiculous from beginning to end.Let's start with the title: ""The Nice Girl's Guide to Sensational Sex"". Really? For real? You're serious? Is this from the people who brought us ""Loose 60 pounds in 10 days on the Twinkie diet""? or from the team who brought us ""Mink Coats for Animal Activists"" Oh! Oh! Lemme guess it's from the publishers of ""Healing the Dead"". What group of people was the author targeting?In reality, this gem is too conservative to yield results for women trying to spice things up, and far too risqué for say...you're average Mormon 'nice girl.' The result is neither cold nor warm, here nor there. It's extremely cheesy and about as awkward as having a sex talk at 13 with your father.I predict that in the future (like in 50 years), this kind of book will be a kitsch collector's item. That's the only reason I bought it. It's just too funny. So I give it 2 stars just because it's funny."
2,Good for the money but...,"Considering it is a fairly cheap wheel I suppose you get what you pay for;It is sturdy but the pedals dont have a high enough resistance and IMO have too much travel in them.The paddles are easy to reach but the other buttons are a little awkward and take some searching-for if you are in the heat of a moment.The steering is EXTREMELY notchy, which for the game I play makes this wheel almost impossible to use with certain high powered rear wheel cars that are extremely sensitive to slight movements."
2,"Okay, But Only Lasted 1 Week.","I bought this wheel for 80 dollars at Circuit City, and to tell the truth it was a waste of my money. It is very bulky and it barely fit on my desk, and the racing just isn't realistic in my opinion. After one week (I took very good care of it) it just broke, stopped working. I reccomend you spend your money on something else."
2,Way long from pratical problems,"Only one chapter, the classic Dorfman & Steiner model ""Optimal Advetising and Quality"" is worthy. Others chapters bring models with too many variables which parameters are unknown for all practical purpose."
1,Warning! Abridged!,"The editor says, ""The present edition is an attempt to 'let Reid speak for himself.'"" Yet he deletes the first two sections of Reid's primary essay and begins with the third! And he continues this practice throughout the work. Unacceptable. Get the whole story in an unabridged edition - Reid is worth reading."
5,This is THE MUST HAVE PRODUCT for ANY burn blister!!!!,"My 10 year old was helping to cook and burned her arm on a skillet. It was very painful, but not too scary until she scraped the blister off while we were at the Lake...yuck. The wound was scary after that & I desperately went to the pharmacy store trying to find something to treat it. I found an antiseptic foaming cleanser and 1 little box of these gel burn pads. I bought several tapes to hold the thing in place and this thin stretchy cut-to-size mesh to lightly hold everything in place. The second I put the gel pad on she said it quit hurting. I went from store to store trying to find them and every single store only had 1 box. I finally came to Amazon & found them for slightly better prices & free 2 day shipping with my Prime membership! I was very relieved after a couple of days it started looking much better & her burn healed in just under 2 weeks---The very best part is she was pain free the entire time. That is the priceless part!"
3,"good premise, dragging writing",great characters but this book dragged. i skimmed the last 40 pages to see what happened. it was much of the same...
2,Not impressed,"This wasn't a terrible book - I read it all the way to the end - but I was kind of waiting for it to end. I cared just enough about the characters to see what was going to happen to them. <Spoiler alert> Every character is a cliche - the codependent, needy wife; the husband who wants to abdicate his responsibilities and takes up with a prostitute; an anorexic girl; and a girl who cuts herself with razors and Swiss army knives. Marquit's jaded, in-your-face style, with liberal use of profanity and a Darwinian view of high school, is one-sided. Her characters are GOOD or BAD, not multi-dimensional. As far as the plot goes, I got the sense that most of this stuff had never happened to her, and she was going for shock value rather than authenticity. For a high school experience that is rendered in living, breathing, convincing color, I would recommend Curtis Sittenfeld's PREP instead."
3,I can relate,"I think it is false when I hear people say that teenagers can't identify with the characters or that the characters in the story are exaggerated, because I am sixteen and can relate completely with the characters Amanda Marquit created. I would recommend this book for people who enjoy the movie ""thirteen"" or the book by Rebecca ray ""Pure"". This novel is extremely realistic in my opinion and i think the average teen would enjoy it very much."
2,Shut the Door,"I like Marquit's style, absolutely hated the book as a whole.Someone earlier mentioned that teenagers cannot identify themselves well with this novel. I believe this is completely false. While the characters in this novel might be a bit exaggerated, the emotions each character displays are certainly things one can relate to from time to time...especially teenage girls. Desperation, hopelessness, loss of direction, superficial goals, confusion; they are real problems that don't just exist in the world of books, hollywood and soap operas. I enjoyed Marquit's portrayal of these emotions through the characters (who are all deliciously troubled and screwed up).The thing that killed the book for me though is how repetitive Marquit got after the first thirty-ish pages. After being so moved by the first thirty pages, I then half-heartedly read/skimmed through the rest of the book.I look forward to reading Marquit's writing in 5-10 years."
5,A 60's Pleasure,"If the 60's were a big part of your life, you will identify with this tale of a young girl's evolution. And if you weren't around for the flower power days, you will learn a lot about what it was like for those who were. I read the book in one sitting as I went along for a ride both sorrowful and joyful in the making. Princess Morning Star's coming of age was entertaining, enlightening, and enjoyable."
4,A Book Well Worth The Read,This is the story of a young lady growing up in the 60's and the challenges she faces as she seeks to find herself. It is simply amazing how the main character should have folded up and died several times due to the cards she was dealt by life. But she persevered and came out a better person for it!This book reads very quickly and you find yourself growing with the main character the whole way!
2,"Seems Well Made, But Didn't Work for Me","I attached one end of this cable to our wall-mounted DSL adapter and one end to our wireless hub, but it doesn't seem to process data properly, making browsing web sites extremely slow and troublesome. The cable seems well made, but it's useless for my needs."
2,Sorry I Bought This,Not much substance in this DVD; I thought there would be more of a workout but not so.
1,Now And Then Bobby Rydell,"I received shipment yesterday and returned it today. It should be tittled Now And Now, the oldies are all resung and they stink. I've been trying for a long time to get his Cameo hits on cd but no luck. If you like Bobby Rydell as a big band singer (and some do) this is for you. It like me you're a purist, this album is not for you."
2,Moderately helpful,"I purchased this prior to actually purchasing my iBook and it was helpful in arranging my files on my PC desktop for the transfer to the new notebook. Beyond that, though, the information is fairly basic.If you have any experience with computers, the transfer is readily accomplished without the software program that is promoted quite heavily in the book (and which the author had a hand in)."
1,"Sounds cool, but does it really work?","My son and I spent several hours trying to get this to work. It never did. Pumping up pressure took forever and then you had to roll it really fast to get it to move up the ramp. Most of the time, the water jet never worked or released way to late for any jump action."
4,Inspired recipes and techniques revealed,"Ms.Lee's book captures the essence of eating for the new millenium--interesting, nutritious recipes that don't rely on meat for flavor. The range of recipes is broad and the dozen or so that I have tried have received rave reviews from both my catering clients and my family alike. There is something here for everyone!"
3,"great ideas, results not so great","This book is very appealing to read through and the recipes look great -- but I just didn't get good results with it. One of my particular peeves is that her dressings are too sharp and sour, because she cuts the oil to keep the fat down. But you can't just remove oil without compensating in some way -- you have to replace it with fruit juice, broth, corn syrup or something else and balance the dressing carefully to make sure it still tastes good. It's definitely possible to make good-tasting low-fat food -- but not necessarily with this book!"
5,Great ideas,"i've only done a few, but they were so flavorful. I'm not a vegetarian, but I'm always looking for more creative ways to get my 5-a-day. Here are my faves: p. 48 - House Balsamic Vinaigrette; p. 134 - Pasta w/ Marsala & Wild Mushrooms; p. 190 - Spinach Risotto; p. 156 - Cannellini Beans w/ Mustard Cream Sauce."
1,Old product,"This review is similar to another 1 W Dorcy product as they are the same, but the price on this version is appropriate. This product has been updated with a 3 W Luxeon recently for not much more money. The brightness difference with the 3 W is astounding. 1 W will show the path in front of you, while the 3 W will light the path in front and around. The downside is no focusing of the light. Take a look at your local Sears for the 1 and 3 watt versions. Target may also have both versions as I bought my 1 Watt from Target."
4,top stub leather checkbook cover,I bought this checkbook holder because the ones you get with your checks are so cheap and flimsey. When I got the holder I really liked the thick leather. This is a cover that will never tear up and it holds your top stub checks so well. It also has another section holder that you can carry stamps or credit cards. The only thing I dont like about it is it is very heavy because of the thick leather. I would buy another just like this one if I lost mine because it will never wear out.Bobby Standlee
4,Leather checkbook cover,I like the oversize dimension tho it still fits nicely in my purse. Leather is not quite as smooth as I would've liked.
1,Not for Adults or Older Children,"Each year I add movies to our large Christmas movie collection. Based on the description and reviews, I purchased this movie last year. My teenage daughter and I sat down to watch it, only to turn it off shortly after it began. We kept hoping it would get better, but unfortunately the weak story line and poor music (It is a musical.) failed to hold our interest. Perhaps a younger viewing audience might find it amusing, but certainly not teens or adults. Keep that in mind if you do decide to purchase. I plan to give our DVD away this year, and have no desire to even finish viewing it."
3,Good for Children,"This is a good movie for teaching Children. It was somewhat hard for me to get into as it seemed a bit more for the country western type of person which I am not. But it has a lot of good lessons and wonderful ideas that are brought out in songs and unique ideas for Christmas. I could even see where different areas of it could be used other times of the year as part of bible lessons at Sunday School if someone wanted to. It was rather dry in spots and very good in others, I gave it 3 stars because of running hot and cold this way."
3,Just in Time for Christmas,This is an okay dvd. It is not the kind of movie you would thik it is. It is more like a play acting type show.
4,Nice CD,"Ray Still, legendary former principal oboist of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, delivers a sterling set of performances. His Strauss concerto is one of the very best you can find, especially if you want an American oboe sound."
4,a musical garden,"This was the first cd of its type I have brought into my audio library,but it was a good introduction. I've known about Eric Johnson for most of his career and always was fond of his sound, but just never got around to adding any of his stuff to my collection. Then I went to a joint Joe Satriani/Eric Johnson evening, and the next day there were 3 new cds in my collection. This, his latest, is a nice presentation of all of his stuff, from chicken-pickin' (the excellent ""Tribute to Jerry Reed"") to smooth, cool jazz (""Hesitant"" ; ""Ciel""), to working his pleasant tenor in one of his forays into lyricism (the also pleasant ""Sad Legacy"" and ""Your Sweet Eyes""). My main fault with Johnson's music is I can hardly ever understand what he's singing, but his voice is so agreeable and his tunes so listenable that i'm willing to overlook it. This is a solid body of work, full of clean lilting notes and stinging riffs. A good inclusion in the library of any guitar aficianado."
3,Mediocre at Best,"We've heard it all before--and that's not a bad thing; considering Eric Johnson's brilliance. Unfortunately, the songs here do little to enhance his catalog. I'm not sure what it is exactly, but the overall impression is ""uninspired,"" perhaps? I'm usually tempted to play EJ's songs on my guitar (yeah, right!) but I don't really feel the urge this time. Oh well, few artists can touch the emotional/technical heights that EJ has. If one had never heard his earlier stuff, I suspect one might have a more favorable opinion of Bloom. I keep hearing recycled riffs and structures which are only dim echoes of his groundbreaking excellence. Even the best run out of stellar ideas eventually."
2,Snoresville,There are some really bad songs on here. Some really cheezy boring songs. Some OK songs. Some filler songs. A really poor effort. Eric Johnson set the bar too high with his previous albums which were fantastic. This just misses the mark in so many ways. Vocoder. 80's electronic drums. Vocal auto-tune?? Really??? Pass on this one and get his previous albums first.
2,Elevator Music,"I loved Ah Via Musicom. It displayed great musicianship, and the guitar tone we all love. Bloom gets the tone back, but this album is very hit-and-miss as far as songwriting. There are definitely some good tracks; Eric starts out strong; most of the songs in the prelude section are great. The last 2/3s of the album, however, sounds like elevator music. Particularly bad are 'From My Heart', 'Your Sweet Eyes', and 'Sunnaround You'. Mr. Johnson has never had a very good singing voice, and the sort of simple and obvious songwriting in these songs makes them even harder to listen to."
2,"First Pat Metheny, and now Eric Johnson... when will it end?","Why are all my favorite guitarists putting out albums with absolutely no sense of emotion, majesty or scope (see Pat Metheny's The Way Up)? Instead, this latest effort on the part of Johnson is a collection of hackneyed riffs and song structures, entirely devoid of inspiration and fervor. Where is the enthusiam of Tones? Where are the creative melodies of Ah Via Musicom? Where is the grandeur of Venus Isle? I mean, come on, Columbia, which so many are hailing as the best song on the album, sounds like it could be the theme song for Family Matters or Step by Step. Finally, the album is mastered too hot. My ears hurt after listening... every frequency is overloaded. A great disappointment indeed, considering the nine year wait. On the positive side, the artwork is beautiful."
5,Eric Johnson continues to satisfy as Guitar Great!,"Eric Johnson is a name spoken in reverent tones within guitar communities. His newest offering, Bloom, showcases the veteran axe-slinger's pristine tone, awe-inspiring chops and songwriting talent in ways his fans have come to expect. On this release, however, Johnson expands his release format to include many nuances of his ongoing musical growth.Highly recommended to fans, both new and old. A guitar-player's dream."
5,Eric Johnson...Bloom,"I have been a fan of Eric Johnson since I first saw him play in concert back in 1989. ""Bloom"" is a collection of songs that show just how great a player Eric has become and how his technique and style have matured over time. The elements of all styles and genres are present, which help to keep the listener engaged. True to how Eric does things, this album is like none of his others...A must have for everyone's collection.Enjoy.My Top picks...Bloom, Columbia, 12 to 12 Vibe, Tribute To Jerry Reed, and Sunnaround You."
4,New Directions for Eric (for the patient),"The first few times I listened to this recording, I ran out of time before I got past track 3 or 4. Reflecting only upon those songs, I was a little dissappointed in this disc. It sounded like more of the same - mile after mile of 32nd note flourishes from Johnson, with a fairly sterile-sounding backup. It's great stuff, but we all have hours of this kind of his playing in our libraries now.But, once I had a chance to get all the way through it, my opinion of this disc improved a lot. It really gets started around ""Sad Legacy"" and moves from there. The B-side of the disc contains several really cool explorations, sounding nothing at all like Johnson has recorded in the past. Culminating in the funky, boppy ""Magnetized"", Eric Johnson shows some real reach on this one. I'm glad he's still around."
4,"Inconsistent, but no big deal","Good album, but bounces around among different musical genres. For examples, listen to ""Ciel,"" ""Cruise the Nile,"" and ""Tribute to Jerry Reed."" Anyone expecting pure rock n roll EJ style will be disappointed, but I'm sure that you'll find at least a few tunes on this album to love. Besides the 3 I previously mentioned, I also recommend the tracks ""From My Heart,"" ""Good to Me,"" and ""My Back Pages,"" which is a re-working of an old Bob Dylan song."
5,A beautiful Gift,"Eric has now begun to stretch his boundrys as i hoped he would some day.Realy shows his stuff as a writer,producer,and master musician.A album like this only comes along once in a while and is destined to be an instant clasic"
4,As expected from SOG,"I returned this in favor of a knife with a partially serrated blade, but this is still a great knife. Blade is sharp, blade steel is AUS8, which isn't the greatest but it's good, should hold an edge and stand up to a reasonable amount of abuse. The blade is bigger than you would expect, both in length and in thickness. The back of the blade has ridges for your thumb to provide more support. The rubber handle is comfortable, and unlike some knives which have finger grooves cut in, the grip is plain, making this knife comfortably ambidextrous. While it does have a full tang, it isn't as sturdy as I would expect - see for yourself by unscrewing the screw at the pommel, and be careful about flexing the blade side to side, as that is most likely to break the tang. This knife isn't the greatest, and it has a few problems, but it does have the quality you would expect from SOG and it is a nice-looking and well-performing tool."
5,"""killer"" knife","Hefty, sturdy, excellent grip and extremely sharp as befitting an SOG product though any decent knife is sharp right out of the box. In a pinch it would serve as a digging implement or pry bar."
5,Unflinching and dramatic,"Irene Louise's novel, Circumstance Of Conception is the riveting story of Grace Mulligan, a counselor at a Baltimore women's shelter who is brutally beaten and raped in a shadowed parking lot. Two weeks later Grace awakens from a coma to find that the assault upon her body has altered her life. Her husband, Jackson, tries to come to terms with what has happened but a rift grows between them when Grace discovers that as a result of the rape she is now pregnant. Grace is plunged into an emotional and familial maelstrom as the instinct to protect her unborn child clashes with her need to preserve her family. Circumstance Of Conception is an unflinching and dramatic examination of critical personal and social issues that are as timely as today's newspaper headlines."
3,No lo compres si no tienes un pies sumanente delgado!,"El zapato es muy lindo y realmente de muy buena calidad, pero para poderlo utilizar sin que te lastimes tienes que tener un pie muy delgado ya que los refuerzos a los lados del zapato te lastiman el la parte superior del pie."
2,Not for Laptops,"I would not suggest buying this product for a laptop. I tried it on my Dell Insipiron and the ""wet"" wipe was too wet and the ""dry"" wipe was absolutely useless and possibly damaging. Possibly. I would advise using soft kleenex or the type of lint-free cloths used for eyeglasses.I found that these worked fine for my PDA and camera screens. But the ""wet"" wipe is very wet, so I would still suggest having some extra kleenex or some cloth available for drying.Packaging allows you to bring individual wipes which is helpful for travel.No matter what, not worth more than a few dollars."
2,Where????,"How annoying to not show us a current map (or a sequence of current maps) with the trip route noted! My first question is ""where did they go?"" And then, what Red River are they tallking about? It's not the Red River of the North (too far north), it's not the Red River in northern New Mexico-- where is it? One must find some other maps ---of Louisiana and parts due west, and dig around to find the geographic area covered by this book. It was hard to keep interested when I could not get a true feel for the geographic locations. The botany and annotations regarding the botany were intriguing."
5,One of the Best,"Along with many others, including star Anthony LaPaglia, I'm in the dark as to why this show was cancelled. This DVD of the first season exemplifies the quality and entertainment value of this terrific show, one that only progressed through the seaons until last year when it was dumped by the loser network. We see how the team learns to deal with each other, as well as the victims. Kind of a kick to see how young looking they all were that first season. I am enjoying watching the episodes and can highly recommend this to anyone who likes high quality tv shows."
5,Great Series.,Without a Trace - The Complete First SeasonGreat Cast + Superb Acting + Absorbing Stories = Great Series
5,second season on DVD,"When are they going to release the second season???? I really enjoyed the first season and would like to purchase the second season, but nobody is selling it. Does anybody have any information on the release of the 2nd season????"
3,Didn't really watch it,Can't comment really because I didn't really watch it. The first episode didn't grab my attention like I thought it would.
5,WITHOUT A TRACE 1,The only thing I didn't like about season one was the case it came in. Thank God the second season was normal casing. I like being able to grab one DVD case not take and unfold you need a place to rest it while taking them out.I have been emailing the station for 2 reasons. One I am a new watcher of Without a trace and wanted to know what season the show is in. The second question was I see all other shows come back next week but do not see Without a Trace on there lineup. I wanted to know when the season would start. needless to say 2 emails 2 weeks and NO answer.This is a great show and I recommend it to anyone who likes mistery's
5,The best show on TV!!!,"This show is one of the most sophisicated shows on TV at the moment. Each hour-long episode focuses on the story of the missing person with highlights to the characters' personal lives, and the mix is perfect. Full of suspense and intrigue, you will find yourself hooked to each episode as I am! I am living in the UK at the moment, and we have Season 2 and 3 on DVD - which makes up for TV still showing Season 4! Antony Lapaglia is excellent as the senior agent (see Season 7 of Frasier to see him in a totally different light!) and the other agents are played by extremely good actors. Well worth a view!"
4,To Please A Lady,The title has nothing to do with the excellent auto racing inthis movie. Actual scenes of auto racing...not Hollywoodshots. Poor acting gets 2 thumbs down but is worth it for the footage.
2,Disappointing and misleading,"The DVD quality is poor. It feels like an old VHS tape. Most disappointing, considering this is from National Geographic! Collector's Edition my foot.The title is misleading. This dvd has nothing to do with Everest. It mostly discusses Hillary's social endeavors in Khumbu region-- which is nice, but not what I purchased it for. If you want to see anything about surviving Everest, watch the Nova series: ""Everest: The death zone""."
4,History made interesting,This fiction work based on the Bender family really holds your interest from front to back. It allows you to relive the early western history.
2,Just A Jumping Off Point,"I have the first edition of this book, and while I find it enjoyable, it is only good as a jumping off point. It's good for ideas on where to go. But any native Angeleno (such as myself) and avid urban explorer (such as myself) will find these tame strolls too limiting. My advice? Take Walking L.A.'s short routes and triple them, perhaps even quadruple them. Go into the areas suggested but go a lot wider. In a city like L.A., where you often have to get into the car and drive 5-10 miles just to get to the neighborhood you are going to explore, there is no point in taking a mile and a half walk.Although many of these routes are standard and well-known there are a few hidden gems that many natives don't know about, such as Castlemarre and Mount Washington. But again, go longer than the book suggests."
1,"I was seduced by ""oh darlin""","Unfortunately I heard only ""oh darlin"" off of 4ad's website before running out to buy this album on its release day November 7. I was seduced by the cut's trip hop/My Bloody Valentine sound and couldn't wait to hear more. My feelings now, after having heard the entire album was I had been set up. The album, except for possibly tracks 6,9 and 11 are excruciating doodles of chaos that would have been better left in the studio or compiled into another CD titled ""Meaningless Cacophony Due to Lack of Vision"". These self directed guys could have greatly benefited from an editor and I can only wonder now if their uncle is Ivo. Ivo, you should have put your foot down!"
2,"Good product, if you like pain and not so great results","I read the reviews and decided to use this product.. I am pretty savvy in the beauty world so I figured people just weren't using them right.. HOWEVER..I have thick eyebrows that can be very unruly.. hence why I bought this product. I cleaned my eyebrows with dove soap.. and applied alcohol.. let them dry and let the pain begin.. The strips are not at a correct arch for my eyebrows and it was difficult to cut them to the correct shape.. The hair came off just fine.. but so did my skin:( I have a huge patch of irritated skin that is peeling under my eye.. others can't notice but I do. All in all this product is good to remove the hair maybe for a few stray hairs in between going to the salon if you dont want to tweeze, but it is definately not your go to product. AND I HAVE 5 BOXES LEFT:("
1,Terrible Product,This product did not work at all. It is a waste of money and time. It is like using scotch tape on your eyebrows. Worthless.
2,Don't buy,I would not buy instant eyebrow shaper from Amazon because you can buy it at Fred's (18 sets of pre-cut shapers) for around $4.00.
1,crap,yet again no option for NO STARS!!!! another waste of money. these irritate the skin before they actually pull out any hair.
5,Beckett + Huff = AOR Success!!,"Peter Beckett teamed up with guitarist Dann Huff (Giant) to make one of the best AOR albums ever. There are absolutely no fillers on this CD and the musiciansip will impress you. Standout songs are: I Told You So, Brother Louie, How Can The Girl Refuse & Not A Day Goes By (also recorded by Georgia Satellites Bassist Rick Price on his ""Heaven Knows"" CD. If you are a fan of Survivor, Journey, Foreigner and Robert Tepper you need this cd. Do not miss having this gem if you love AOR."
3,Product Description Inaccurate,"This cable does not have a snagless boot as advertised.Other than that, it seems fine for the price.The cable itself is printed with the words ""patch cable"" which is nice to keep it from being mistaken for a standard Ethernet cable."
3,Crossover,Cable needs to be marked so it's not confused with regular RJ45M cable. Can't tell the difference between a regular LAN cable and the crossover cable. Other than that it worked as advertised.
2,Didn't work with Windows 7,"Didn't work for me on connecting two Windows 7 computers. Well, this cable may not be entirely to blame, as Microsoft is making things more complex with each release, thinking that they are simplifying life. Hope they learn some day."
5,"Great set of goals, worth the money.",I have a pair of these that I've had for a few years now. They are great. They take a lot of abuse and I've yet to have any major problems. They fold up and are easy to store and transport.
5,DIG UP THIS BOOK AND TREASURE IT! IT IS A CLASSIC!,"I have loved this book since I was a very little girl. My favorite uncle was a construction worker and all of my life I have had nothing but the deepest respect for these skilled workers who provide much needed services. A large part of Mike's appeal is his hard driven work ethic (like my uncle), the cool trucks and construction equipment (like my uncle used) and of course, his ultimate success.Need I add that my favorite uncle liked Mike, too?"
3,"Ok, but a little disappointing","Not only is this an abridged version, but the duplication of the words below the page (and sometimes with words not on the page) makes it visually confusing."
5,A classic!,"What can I say that hasn't already been said! This book is a wonderful classic. Not just for boys...my daughter loves it! It has a wonderful heartwarming story. We especially liked how Mike treated Mary Anne (his steam shovel) ... he took great care of her. And, of course found a new use for her when steam shovels were no longer needed! Wonderful addition to any home library!"
4,My sons favorite book as a little boy,"I received the order very quickly and it was packed good, a very nice book, well made."
2,Takes FOREVER to read aloud,"Although the story and the characters are classics, this is a book for children who can read to themselves, because it is just interminable to read to them. It's a very long story, with a lot of detail, and can be painful to read again and again (and again and again and again and again, which is really how often you read books to little people)."
1,DEEPLY DISSAPOINTED IN AMAZON,"AMAZON SHOWED THIS BOOK TO BE PRINTED IN THE USA. THE BOOK I RECEIVED WAS PRINTED IN CHINA. I AM DEEPLY DISSAPOINTED IN AMAZON AND RETURNING THIS BOOK. HAD I WANTED A CHEAP CHINESE PRINTING, I COULD HAVE EASILY PURCHASED THAT ANYWHERE. WILL NOW BE MISTRUSTFUL OF AMAZONS INTEGRITY"
1,Nightmarish,"The steam-shovel is personified enough in the book, and at the age I was introduced to this book, I had a fuzzier concept of animate vs inanimate. The ending... living forever in a basement, immobile, was hellish. I cried in horror at the steam-shovel's fate. While I wouldn't recommend this book to any child, I would be especially cautious if the child has demonstrated any interest in construction machinery."
2,Capitalist Reactionary Garbage,"A structural children's ""classic,"" Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel embodies the ideals of an industrial humanism that is the treat of progress in contemporary society. As a result of technological enhancements, Mike Mulligan's anthropomorphic steam-shovel, Mary-Ann, is rendered obsolete by the new gas and diesel-engine contraptions. Mike has apparently made an attachment to the mechanical monster that has enslaved him, and madly persues his own destruction in a frenzied rebellion against the future. The story paradoxically ends with Mike Mulligan being the victor, embodying the victory of obsolescence in the face of change. Give me a break."
2,Discouraging no one cares about rigid gender roles,"It's discouraging to me that no one even mentions the extremely rigid gender roles in this book (straight out of the early 1950s). All the fireMEN are MEN, all the policeMEN are MEN, there is no gender neutral language, and worse, all the girls and women are in totally old fashioned roles...I can't stand it, and the book isn't that great anyway.."
5,Classic,"Classic book, good quality can't complain about that gave to my nephew as a Christmas fit and his dad said it was one of is raves as a kid"
4,Still a Fan,"I still love this book. Teaches the balance between progress and tradition. Hard work, good attitude, and ingenuity pay off in the end. Had to explain what furnace was (we live in Miami), but all my kids (8, 6, & 4) enjoyed it."
2,The Board Book took out the plot,"I hate to give this such a low rating, but before you buy the board book edition you need to know that it isn't just shortened, but the whole plot is gone.Yes Henry B Swap is mentioned, but no mention of a challenge to dig the cellar in one day, or he won't get paid.No sun high in the sky and being halfway done.No Henry B Swap saying that since the steam shovel can't get out they don't get paid.No ending where Henry B. Swap sits in the cellar and smiles in a way that's not mean at all.If you want the great story, DON'T BUY THE BOARD BOOK!"
5,Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel,"This wasn't a book that I was familiar with, but my husband read it frequently when he was little. The first time I read it to my daughter we both fell in love."
2,lost charge,the rate that these batteries lost their ability to charge was faster than the decline of our economy - terrible
4,Really charge in 15 mins,"Pros1) Charge in 15 mins - 18mins.2) Green/Red Light indicator to tell you the charge status3) A powerful fan on the charger. Battery is cool to touch after charging4) Charge both AAA & AA. Max 4 capacityCons1) Would prefer to have a green/red light indicator for every cell instead of only 1 light.2) ULTRA LOUD Fan. There is no way u can sleep while this thing charge. Its 3 times louder than the loudest pentium 2 desktop.If u dun mind the fan noise, then get this charger You will be amaze at the speed."
1,Received the wrong item....,"I received a 30-minute charger in the mail instead of the described 15-minute charger, and it came with 1850 mAh AA batteries instead of 2200 mAh AA's. I am very disappointed with goHastings so far, but I have emailed customer support, so we will see what happens....if this is resolved efficiently and favorably, I will change this review to only reflect my opinion of the charger itself."
1,Picture Doesn't Match the Description,"Not happy at all. It is called a 27 piece set but the picture has letter's, numbers and symbols on it. Very deceiving!! For over $30 I have to order again just to get the numbers. I will buy local next time."
3,Not like the picture.,I thought it was multiple boxes like the picture. It is only one blue box. I havent used them yet.
1,Unpleased,"Dear Amazon reader (or listerner for this matter) please read this before you buy T.S. Eliot's tapes. When I first opened the box and placed the tape into the player, it was as though I had let a demon out into my room. T.S. Eliot's voice is very unattractive, and utterly disgraceful. I love T.S. Eliot's works and to listen to him read them (with absolute no rythym)was unbearable. Rather than buying this, you should just buy His complete works. Thank you."
2,Tedious and dismal,"The poetry itself is great, but you wouldn't know it listening to this tedious depressing voice. I supose it could be good to know how Eliot himself thought the poetry should sound, but I think I will stick with my own fantasy of how it should sound.I suspect anyone coming to Eliot for the first time through this collection would probably give up and turn to someone else."
2,Not what I thought,"This is not what i thought it would be. I was looking for a book to teach me about reading brands and that sort of thing. This book is a STORY to read,,,, not to learn."
